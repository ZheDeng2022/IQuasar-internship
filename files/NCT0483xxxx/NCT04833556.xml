      Postpartum haemorrhage is the common cause of maternal death worldwide. The primary purpose&#xD;
      of this study is to identify the maternal outcomes after PPH. The highlighted outcome is the&#xD;
      anesthetic management including rate of blood transfusion and incidence of patient&#xD;
      experiencing massive blood transfusion. The secondary purposes of this study are amount of&#xD;
      blood loss, causes of PPH and other outcomes that related to PPH such as the rate of&#xD;
      hysterectomy and postoperative outcome eg. congestive heart failure, acute kidney injury and&#xD;
      TRALI etc. Additionally, incidence of PPH will be studied. Data collection will be made to&#xD;
      identify the cause of PPH, anesthetic techniques that may related to the amount of&#xD;
      hemorrhage, medical treatment for PPH and neonatal outcomes. We also aim to obtain the rate&#xD;
      of ICU admission and revealed the factors involving the ICU admission in PPH patients&#xD;
      underwent cesarean delivery.&#xD;

      Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is the common cause of maternal death worldwide. It is&#xD;
      interesting to note that PPH is the most common cause of death in developing country.&#xD;
      Additionally, PPH is the common cause of maternal cardiac arrest. PPH defined as the amount&#xD;
      of bleeding more than or equal to 500 ml after vaginal delivery and bleeding of more than or&#xD;
      equal to 1,000 ml after cesarean delivery. The rate of PPH regardless any route of delivery&#xD;
      was 2.9-3.2%. Rate of PPH in patients undergoing cesarean delivery was approximately 0.6% -&#xD;
      3.1%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The difference in anesthetic techniques influence the rate of postpartum hemorrhage. Numerous&#xD;
      studies showed the association between general anesthesia and postpartum hemorrhage in&#xD;
      patient undergoing cesarean delivery. The outcome showed the odds of PPH in women who had&#xD;
      cesarean delivery with general anesthesia were 8.15 times higher (95% CI 6.43-10.33) than for&#xD;
      those who had CS with epidural anesthesia. Likewise, systematic review and meta-analysis&#xD;
      revealed general anesthesia associated with higher amount of blood loss, but not the&#xD;
      transfusion rate comparing with regional anesthesia. The decreasing of myometrial uterine&#xD;
      tone from the usage of inhalational agents (halothane, enflurane, isofurane, sevoflurane, and&#xD;
      desflurane) from general anesthesia explains this consequence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Guidelines recommended the management of PPH after cesarean delivery were launched. World&#xD;
      Health Organization (WHO) recommendation reported both surgical together with medical&#xD;
      management (non-surgical) in patients with PPH, which published in the year 2012. The major&#xD;
      role of anesthesiologists involving in treatment of PPH is medical treatment and blood and&#xD;
      blood component administration. The novel medical treatment of PPH has been described in&#xD;
      several literatures including the usage of tranexamic acid and fibrinogen concentrate. The&#xD;
      World Maternal Antifibrinolytic trial (WOMAN trial) is the large-sample size randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial publishing in the Lancet in the year 2017. WOMAN trial revealed the&#xD;
      administration of tranexamic acid in patients with PPH after vaginal or cesarean delivery&#xD;
      significantly reduced blood loss and decreased maternal mortality rate from bleeding.&#xD;
      Likewise, Cochrane database systematic review concluded in the year 2018 that intravenous&#xD;
      tranexamic acid reduced mortality rate due to bleeding in women with PPH, irrespective of&#xD;
      mode of delivery. The WHO collaborator subsequently launched the update of recommendation&#xD;
      including the administration of tranexamic acid 1 gram in PPH patients within 3 hours after&#xD;
      birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, the rate of ICU admission after postpartum hemorrhage was studied revealing 15 of&#xD;
      21 patients (71.4%). Of which, 12 patients presented disseminated intravascular coagulation&#xD;
      (DIC) and 2 cases death (9%). Critically-ill patients deriving from massive hemorrhage from&#xD;
      PPH also transfusion-related acute lungs injury (TRALI), congestive heart failure, acute&#xD;
      kidney injury and multiorgan failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we emphasize in patients underwent cesarean delivery with PPH (intraoperative&#xD;
      estimated blood loss &gt; 1,000 ml). The primary purpose is to identify the maternal outcomes&#xD;
      after PPH. The highlighted outcome is the anesthetic management including rate of blood&#xD;
      transfusion and incidence of patient experiencing massive blood transfusion. The secondary&#xD;
      purposes of this study are amount of blood loss, causes of PPH and other outcomes that&#xD;
      related to PPH such as the rate of hysterectomy and postoperative outcome eg. congestive&#xD;
      heart failure, acute kidney injury and TRALI etc. Additionally, incidence of PPH will be&#xD;
      studied. Data collection will be made to identify the cause of PPH, anesthetic techniques&#xD;
      that may related to the amount of hemorrhage, medical treatment for PPH and neonatal&#xD;
      outcomes. We also aim to obtain the rate of ICU admission and revealed the factors involving&#xD;
      the ICU admission in PPH patients underwent cesarean delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The detail of outcomes of PPH in cesarean delivered patients in Siriraj hospital is scared;&#xD;
      and it has not yet been described in the literature. Therefore, the authors aim to collected&#xD;
      the data and analyzed the outcomes associated with PPH, in order to report in the literatures&#xD;
      as well as improving the anesthetic management of intraoperative PPH in our institute.&#xD;
