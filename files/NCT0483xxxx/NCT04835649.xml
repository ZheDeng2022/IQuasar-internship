  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a disease that affects the functional skills of the upper&#xD;
      extremity with clinical findings such as bradykinesia, rigidity, and hypokinesia and causes&#xD;
      limitations in the daily life activities of the patients. Task-oriented training (TOT) is a&#xD;
      highly individualized, client-centered, occupational therapy, functional-based intervention&#xD;
      compatible with motor learning and motor control principles such as intensive motor training,&#xD;
      variable practice, and intermittent feedback. Few studies have been found on the TOT of the&#xD;
      upper extremity in PD. Telerehabilitation of Parkinson's patients shows many strengths, such&#xD;
      as cost-related and time-dependent ease, and the possibility of telecommunication with&#xD;
      clinicians. In addition, the refinement of digital health solutions with the goal to offer a&#xD;
      patient-tailored intervention remains an ongoing process. There are a limited number of&#xD;
      studies on TOT and telerehabilitation of the upper extremity in PD. In addition, no studies&#xD;
      have been found applying TOT through telerehabilitation. For this purpose, a study including&#xD;
      TOT-based telerehabilitation in upper extremity education in PD was planned.&#xD;

      This study is a randomized controlled study. The patients will be randomly divided into two&#xD;
      groups as exercise and control. Balance and walking exercises consisting of 3 days a week for&#xD;
      6 weeks will be given to both groups as a home program. In addition, the exercise group will&#xD;
      receive TOT-based telerehabilitation via video conferencing 3 days a week for 6 weeks. TOT&#xD;
      will be formed from daily life activities such as reaching out, grasping, writing, and manual&#xD;
      skills, which are frequently used in daily life. As the outcome measures, disease severity&#xD;
      and disability, finger and hand function, hand strength, and quality of life will be&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;
