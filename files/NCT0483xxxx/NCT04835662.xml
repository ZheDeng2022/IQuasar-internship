  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was pre-post study designed to measure changes in complementary feeding practices and&#xD;
      document the feasibility and acceptability of an intervention to engage fathers in supporting&#xD;
      dietary diversity in Kaduna State, Nigeria. This study was conducted as part of the Alive &amp;&#xD;
      Thrive Nigeria program, implemented by FHI 360 and partners. RTI led the design and&#xD;
      implementation of the study, with Datametrics Associates Ltd. serving as the data collection&#xD;
      partner in Nigeria. The study was carried out in 6 wards (2 urban, 4 rural) of Igabi local&#xD;
      government area in Kaduna State. We collected survey data cross-sectionally from 495&#xD;
      cohabiting mothers and fathers of children 6-23 months at baseline and endline. Participants&#xD;
      were randomly sampled within 99 clusters selected proportional to population size. The&#xD;
      purpose of the surveys was to obtain data on children's complementary feeding, changes in&#xD;
      fathers' and mothers' knowledge and attitudes related to complementary feeding, and fathers'&#xD;
      support for complementary feeding, and to measure participants' exposure to the intervention&#xD;
      components. To measure feasibility and acceptability of the intervention, we conducted 24&#xD;
      in-depth interviews at the end of the intervention with community and religious leaders and&#xD;
      Community Health Extension Workers who were involved in implementing the intervention. In&#xD;
      addition, we conducted separate focus group discussions with mothers and fathers (8 groups&#xD;
      each) at the end of the intervention to learn about changes in social norms related to&#xD;
      fathers' engagement in complementary feeding and their experiences with participating in the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
