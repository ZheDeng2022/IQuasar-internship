  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of shoulder slings on pain, motor&#xD;
      function, daily life and balance in acute hemiplegic patients and to investigate whether&#xD;
      different types of slings are superior to each other.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thirty-two patients with hemiplegic shoulder subluxation due to acute stroke were divided&#xD;
      into two groups: shoulder supported slings and forearm supported slings. Hemiplegia&#xD;
      rehabilitation passive and active-assistive range of motion, stretching, and neurophysiologic&#xD;
      exercises were performed for all patients per day for 8 weeks.Pain assessment was performed&#xD;
      with Visual Analog Scale, sensorimotor evaluation was performed with Fugl Meyer Assessment of&#xD;
      Motor Function,daily life activities were assessed with Barthel Index, and balance was&#xD;
      evaluated with Berg Balance Scale.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Patients were assigned to two groups, shoulder supported slings (group 1, n = 20) and forearm supported slings (group 2, n = 20), by an investigator who was blinded to the study via randomization created by a computer software. Evaluation of the detailed physical examination results, evaluation of demographic features such as age, gender, and etiology as well as evaluation of treatment results were performed by the physiatrist who was blind to randomization.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Visual analog scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline VAS score at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Pain assessment was performed with Visual Analog Scale after 8-weeks after treatment. Using a ruler, the score is determined by measuring the distance (mm) on the 100-mm line between the &quot;no pain&quot; anchor and the patient's mark, providing a range of scores from 0-100. A higher score indicates greater pain intensity.</description>

    <measure>Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Motor Recovery after Stroke</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline Fugl Meyer test score at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Sensorimotor evaluation was performed with Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Motor Recovery after Stroke. Scoring is based on direct observation of performance. Scale items are scored on the basis of ability to complete the item using a 3-point ordinal scale where 0=cannot perform, 1=performs partially and 2=performs fully. The total possible scale score is 226.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Barthel Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline Barthel Index score at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Daily life activities were assessed with Barthel Index. The minimum score is 0, which indicates complete dependency and, the maximum score is 100 indicates complete independence.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Berg Balance Scale (BBS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline Berg Balance Scale score at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Balance was evaluated with Berg Balance Scale. The minimum score is 0 and, the maximum score is 56. 0-20 on the BBS represents balance impairment; 21-40 on the BBS represents acceptable balance; 41-56 on the BBS represents good balance.</description>
