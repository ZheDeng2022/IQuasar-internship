    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical trial is to use the validated PROMIS Emotional Distress - Anxiety -&#xD;
      Short Form 8a and PROMIS Emotional Distress-Depression-Short Form pre-and post-intervention&#xD;
      to establish a superior correlation between the auriculotherapy treatment and the reduction&#xD;
      of perioperative anxiety. Subject population will include those having a partial or total&#xD;
      nephrectomy for cancer. Drawing the role that auriculotherapy may play in reducing&#xD;
      perioperative anxiety related requirement after surgery may also help in reducing the risk of&#xD;
      opioid use disorders (OUD) since anxiety has been found to be a major risk factor for OUD in&#xD;
      surgical patients. Therefore, this trial will also examine the effect of the auriculotherapy&#xD;
      intervention in reducing opioid requirement after surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sixty subjects undergoing total or partial nephrectomies will be asked to participate in this&#xD;
      IRB approved placebo-controlled randomized study. Potential subjects will be recruited out of&#xD;
      the surgeon's office or at a preoperative clinical visit prior to surgery. The clinical care&#xD;
      team will introduce the study and request permission for the research team to speak with the&#xD;
      patient. If the subject agrees to be approached by a member of the research team, then the&#xD;
      research team will approach the subject. During the Informed Consent, a PI or Co-I will be&#xD;
      available to answer final questions and facilitate the process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After signing an informed consent, the subjects will be equally randomized to either active&#xD;
      auriculotherapy treatment (with nitrogen gas) or placebo auriculotherapy treatment (without&#xD;
      nitrogen gas). Each subject will be asked to complete the PROMIS Emotional Distress - Anxiety&#xD;
      - Short Form 8a, the PROMIS Emotional Distress-Depression-Short Form and Pain Catastrophizing&#xD;
      Scale (PCS) in the pre-operative setting. Those whose anxiety scores are â‰¥19 will be included&#xD;
      in the study and randomly distributed to either treatment allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will occur by assigning the participant a subject ID number, and this ID number&#xD;
      will correspond to a treatment allocation based on a pre-designed randomization schema. This&#xD;
      treatment allocation (intervention/control) will be contained in a sealed, opaque, envelope&#xD;
      with the subject ID number that is designated on envelope. The master randomization list will&#xD;
      be created and held by an independent data monitor who will both create and hold the master&#xD;
      randomization list. A data manager research associate will confidentially reveal the&#xD;
      randomization to the PI or Amy Monroe so that the study coordinators, Co-Is and subjects will&#xD;
      be blinded. PI or Amy Monroe, and the data managing associate will be the only individuals&#xD;
      who are unblinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study assessments will be conducted on the day of surgery, in the pre-operative setting. This&#xD;
      will include the PROMIS Emotional Distress - Anxiety - Short Form 8a as this is the first&#xD;
      assessment conducted after obtaining Informed Consent. It is used to assess eligibility for&#xD;
      the study. This assessment will take roughly 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Auriculotherapy treatment will also occur in the pre-operative setting, within one hour of&#xD;
      surgery and after the patient has received a peripheral nerve block. For the active treatment&#xD;
      group, a nitrogen gas canister will be applied to a cryopuncture device (manual attached),&#xD;
      and the tip of the cryopuncture will be sanitized and placed on each treatment point of the&#xD;
      ear, releasing a spurt of gas for 2 seconds on each point (7 points total). For the sham&#xD;
      device, an empty canister will be applied to the cryopuncture device, and in exactly the same&#xD;
      fashion as the treatment group, the tip of the cryopuncture will be sanitized and placed on&#xD;
      each treatment point of the ear. Instead of releasing a spurt of nitrogen gas, the empty&#xD;
      canister will make the same noise as a full canister, but without the expulsion of gas. We&#xD;
      are not expecting any adverse events from performing this technique. The only &quot;adverse event&quot;&#xD;
      that is expected is a mild local blistering/scab, which may occur within 24 hours after the&#xD;
      treatment. In our experience in our ongoing auriculotherapy study (24 subjects enrolled), we&#xD;
      did not observe this adverse event. In the experience of Dr. Chelly(11 years) and Dr. Alimi&#xD;
      (30 years), any local blistering or ulceration is extremely mild, and resolves in days&#xD;
      without any intervention. No potential adverse effect would require immediate treatment or&#xD;
      delay the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After surgery, the subject will be assessed for pain medication requirement and pain scores&#xD;
      in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) and then assessed daily until discharge. Upon&#xD;
      discharge, subjects will repeat the PROMIS Emotional Distress questionnaires and the PCS.&#xD;
      Additionally, subjects will be asked to complete an overall satisfaction questionnaire&#xD;
      measured on a scale to 0-10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will take home a diary where they will record daily NRS pain scores (scale&#xD;
      0-10), daily anxiety level (scale 0-10) and daily analgesic/opioid requirement for one-week&#xD;
      post-op. The subject will be contacted daily after discharge until completion of the pain&#xD;
      diary at Day 7 post-op, and will also be contacted once at 30-day and 90-day post-op to&#xD;
      report the PROMIS Emotional Distress -Anxiety- Short Form 8a, the PROMIS Emotional&#xD;
      Distress-Depression-Short Form, and Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) verbally over the&#xD;
      telephone. The subject will be contacted via phone daily to gather their responses post op to&#xD;
      the surveys, a maximum of three times. If we are unable to reach the subject after 3 days&#xD;
      they will be considered lost to follow up. If In addition to this, the subject will be asked&#xD;
      to assess their functional recovery using the SF-12 questionnaire, and to report their VAS&#xD;
      pain score/opioid consumption for the previous week.&#xD;
