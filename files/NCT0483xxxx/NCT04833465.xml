  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this study is the development of a physiologic endpoint of pain and&#xD;
      treatment effect in three distinct rheumatology populations. This would enable objective&#xD;
      assessment of pain and treatment in these populations and enable a much more precise approach&#xD;
      to treatment. Such an endpoint stands to significantly improve outcomes in these patients by&#xD;
      eliminating the need for a trial-and-error approach to treatment. This is a single site&#xD;
      observational study that aims to collect initial pilot data in three distinct patient groups.&#xD;
      As this is observational, there is no randomization or blinding in the study. Patients will&#xD;
      be followed for a period of one year after enrollment. Baseline measurements will be taken at&#xD;
      the time of enrollment, and at each subsequent standard of care clinic visit as feasible, for&#xD;
      a period of one year. As this is an observational study, there will be no change to the&#xD;
      treatment for any patient due to research activities. The primary objective of this study is&#xD;
      the characterization of the nociceptive index in three pediatric rheumatology populations.&#xD;
      The secondary objective is the characterization of the nociceptive index in these populations&#xD;
      in response to standard of care interventions. This is necessary to demonstrate the ability&#xD;
      of this approach to serve as an endpoint of treatment effect.&#xD;
