      Background: The wound dressings perform a crucial role in the cutaneous wounds' management&#xD;
      due to their ability to protect wounds and promote dermal and epidermal tissue regeneration.&#xD;
      Objective: the aim of the present study to evaluate the effectiveness of using hydrogel/nano&#xD;
      silver-based dressing vs. traditional dressing on diabetic foot wound healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approach: Sixty patients with type-2 diabetes hospitalized for diabetic foot wound treatment&#xD;
      were recruited from selected Surgical departments at Kasr Al-Aini university hospital.&#xD;

      Data Collection: The patients of group-I wounds were cleaned using normal saline; then, the&#xD;
      wounds were closed firmly with hyderogel\nano silver dressing. The dressing was changed every&#xD;
      two days according to dressing manufacture instruction. When the dressing was opened after&#xD;
      three days, the wound was assessed for granulation tissue, wound, and discharge size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients of group II wounds were dresses using a traditional method, cleaned by normal&#xD;
      saline, use of betadine antiseptic; then they were secured with clean linen gauze. The&#xD;
      dressing was changed once daily. The wound healing process of the two groups was then&#xD;
      assessed for three consecutive weeks.&#xD;
