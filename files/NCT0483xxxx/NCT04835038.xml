      1. Title: Effects of Sodium Bicarbonate Ringer's Injection and Sodium Lactated Ringer's&#xD;
           Injection on postoperative acute kidney injury in patients undergoing major abdominal&#xD;
           surgery: a randomized, controlled, open-label clinical study&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Objective: To evaluate the effect of BRS and LRS infusion on acute renal injury in&#xD;
           patients undergoing major abdominal surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Primary outcome: Incidence of AKI at 28 days postoperative (defined as acute kidney&#xD;
           injury, according to Kidgo 2012 definition and classification).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Study Design: Randomized, controlled, open-label clinical study.&#xD;

      1. Subjects: patients who planned to undergo elective major abdominal surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study data collection period: Subjects signed the consent form until 28 days after&#xD;
           discharge or died in hospital or withdrew from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Number of research centers/sample size: 3400 patients were planned to be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Study process: Among patients undergoing elective surgery, the researchers will include&#xD;
           patients who meet the inclusion criteria for elective major abdominal surgery and agree&#xD;
           to participate in the study. The data to be collected in this study will be recorded by&#xD;
           the researcher in the eCRF, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (1) Data to be collected during the screening period and preoperatively: patients' basic&#xD;
      characteristics and demographic data (2) Data to be recorded during and/or after surgery:&#xD;
      primary study indicators, secondary indicators, and other indicators.&#xD;
