  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the feasibility of an expedited referral process for the obese endometrial cancer&#xD;
      or EIN patient from her gynecologic oncologist to the Brigham Center for Metabolic and&#xD;
      Bariatric Surgery (CMBS) in order to undergo concurrent weight loss surgery and hysterectomy&#xD;
      within 8 weeks of first appointment with a gynecologic oncologist (or 12 weeks for EIN&#xD;
      patients).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The most common risk factor for endometrial cancer is obesity. However, because early-stage&#xD;
      endometrial cancer has a very high survival rate, patients more often suffer from long-term&#xD;
      issues related to their weight, like heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. Weight loss surgery&#xD;
      has been shown to help patients lose weight and also decrease their risk for obesity-related&#xD;
      diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study is a Feasibility Study. This is the first-time investigators are studying&#xD;
      both 1) the referral process of patients with endometrial cancer to the Center for Metabolic&#xD;
      and Bariatric Surgery without delaying curative treatment of endometrial cancer 2) the&#xD;
      combined surgery of both hysterectomy and weight loss surgery. The combined surgery of&#xD;
      hysterectomy and weight loss surgery has been performed both at this institution and others&#xD;
      without increased complications, but it has not been formally studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 30 patients are expected to participate in this study at Brigham and Women's&#xD;
      Hospital (BWH).&#xD;
