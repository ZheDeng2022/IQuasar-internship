      This study included patients who were admitted to investigator's center to do laparoscopic&#xD;
      sleeve gastrectomy . Cases were collected in the period from December 2019 to December 2020.&#xD;
      Sample size was 84 patients divided into 2 equal groups . Group 1: included 42 patients who&#xD;
      were subjected to distal mesogastric fixation after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. Group 2:&#xD;
      included 42 patients who were subjected to laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy alone without&#xD;
      distal mesogastric fixation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy is one of weight loss operations and widely performed all&#xD;
      over the world . although its widely performed ,it has serious complications like leakage and&#xD;
      bleeding . The proposed etiology behind leakage after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy may be&#xD;
      the axial rotation of the stomach owing to loss of abdominal ligament fixation along the&#xD;
      greater curvature of the stomach . The mechanism of increased intra-gastric pressure due to&#xD;
      axial gastric rotation may put a lot of stress on the staple lines with increased incidence&#xD;
      of leakage. Other complications may occur such as vomiting, food intolerance or persistent&#xD;
      reflux.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the effect of distal mesogastric fixation after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy to&#xD;
      minimize gastric axial rotation and subsequent leakage and other related complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      investigators included all patients who were subjected to laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy at&#xD;
      investigators' center between December 2019 to December 2020. The study was approved by the&#xD;
      research and Ethics committee of our university and performed in accordance with the code of&#xD;
      ethics of the world medical association (Declaration of Helsinki) for studies involving&#xD;
      humans. A written informed consent was obtained from all participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size The sample size was calculated using open Epi program using the following data ;&#xD;
      confidence interval 95% , power of test 80% , the percent of patients without leak after LSG&#xD;
      was 66.6% while after new technique expected to be 95% , odd ratio 9.5% and ratio between two&#xD;
      group 1:1; so the calculated sample size was 72 patients , taking into consideration 20% drop&#xD;
      outs so the final sample size will be 84 patients divided into 2 equal groups . Group 1:&#xD;
      included 42 patients who were subjected to distal mesogastric fixation after laparoscopic&#xD;
      sleeve gastrectomy. Group 2: included 42 patients who were subjected to laparoscopic sleeve&#xD;
      gastrectomy alone without distal mesogastric fixation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who had no contraindication for laparoscopic surgery (such as patients with no&#xD;
      history of abdominal operations), good general condition with American society of&#xD;
      anesthesiology (ASA) I &amp; II, and patients with body mass index above 35 were included.&#xD;
      investigators excluded patients who had bad general condition (ASA ≥3), patients with gastro&#xD;
      esophageal reflux or hiatal hernia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perioperative measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this prospective randomized control trials , all patients were subjected to the&#xD;
      followings: patients were selected by randomization method , Full history taking , Complete&#xD;
      physical examination , laboratory investigations ( complete blood picture , liver and kidney&#xD;
      functions , coagulation profile ) , radiological investigations ( chest x- ray , CT with oral&#xD;
      and I.V contrast ) &amp; patients were subjected to upper GI endoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical techniques :&#xD;
&#xD;
      investigators performed traditional laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy then investigators fixed&#xD;
      the greater omentum &amp; mesocolon that were cut during gastrectomy to the remaining gstric&#xD;
      pouch along the new greater curvature as high as possible along the stable line then we&#xD;
      plicated the remaining staple line till angle of His. (the greater omentum &amp; mesocolon not&#xD;
      reach this part of staple line) , so the remaining gastric pouch remained tension free and&#xD;
      was returned to original position and this may prevent the axial gastric rotation as in&#xD;
      figures .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up after surgery and discharge from the hospital:&#xD;
&#xD;
      investigators examined the patients clinically, made routine laboratory investigations , made&#xD;
      follow up CT with oral and I.V contrast in first week after the operation if suspected&#xD;
      leakage &amp; patients were subjected to upper GI endoscopy in first week after the operation if&#xD;
      suspected leakage. The patients were followed up for one week, two weeks and one month,&#xD;
      6months post operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The collected data were analyzed by computer using Statistical Package of Social Services&#xD;
      version 22 (SPSS), Data were represented in tables and graphs, Continuous Quantitative&#xD;
      variables e.g. age were expressed as the mean ± SD &amp; (range), and categorical qualitative&#xD;
      variables were expressed as absolute frequencies (number) &amp; relative frequencies&#xD;
      (percentage).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Suitable statistical tests of significance were used after checked for normality. Categorical&#xD;
      data were cross tabulated and analyzed by the Chi-square test or Fisher's Exact Test;&#xD;
      Continuous data were evaluated by student t- test. The results were considered statistically&#xD;
      significant when the significant probability was less than 0.05 (P &lt; 0.05). P-value &lt; 0.001&#xD;
      was considered highly statistically significant (HS), and P-value ≥ 0.05 was considered&#xD;
      statistically insignificant (NS).&#xD;
