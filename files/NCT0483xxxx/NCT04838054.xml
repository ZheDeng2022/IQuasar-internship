  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A full understanding of etiology and diagnosis of peri-implant diseases is crucial for&#xD;
      finding effective treatments for these diseases that are more widely accessible to dentists.&#xD;
      Several treatment protocols for peri-implant diseases have been proposed, but no gold&#xD;
      standard has been established to date. Thus, the purpose of this study is to analyze efficacy&#xD;
      of stabilized chlorine dioxide as a chemical adjuvant for treatment of peri-implant mucositis&#xD;
      in a non-surgical treatment protocol with a 3-month follow-up.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fifty individuals with peri-implant mucositis will be identified to participate in this study&#xD;
      and randomized into two groups to analyze clinical parameters and results of this study: 1)&#xD;
      test group (stabilized chlorine dioxide rinse) and 2) control group (placebo). Each group&#xD;
      will be associated with periodontal basic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Protocol After inclusion of the patients, medical history and initial examination&#xD;
      are performed, patients will be randomly divided into the following two groups: 1) test&#xD;
      (stabilized chlorine dioxide rinse associated with periodontal basic therapy); and 2) control&#xD;
      (placebo associated with periodontal basic therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periodontal basic therapy will consist of oral hygiene instruction, motivation, retentive&#xD;
      factor removal, and an adaptation of the protocol of full-mouth scaling and root planing&#xD;
      (stabilized chlorine dioxide mouthwash will be used). Plastic currets are used to instrument&#xD;
      the implants and metal currets to instrument teeth. Immediately after instrumentation,&#xD;
      chemical solutions of chlorine dioxide or placebo will be dispensed to the subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will follow their normal oral-hygiene procedures with the addition of using the&#xD;
      study rinse toothbrush and toothpaste provided to them.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Subjects will receive an Oral Hygiene Kit at Visit 1. The MGI, BOP and PI, Pocket depth and radiographs will be measured and all oral tissues examined (baseline examination). Subjects will return for Visit 2 in 14 days ± 3 days to: 1) assess and record changes in indices and oral health and any adverse conditions. Visit 3 (45 days ± 7) will be a compliance visit for study drug utilization. Visit 4 (90 days ± 7) will be a repeat of Visit 1.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Once a subject has been screened and qualified for study participation, that subject will be enrolled and assigned the next available randomization number. The study randomization table will be generated by a third-party statistician. This procedure will be used to keep the Study Statistician blinded to subject treatments prior to database lock.</masking_description>
