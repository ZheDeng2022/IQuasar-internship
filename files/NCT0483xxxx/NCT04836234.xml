  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain is the most claimed complaint from orthodontic treatment. Fear of pain has contributed&#xD;
      to patients' avoidance of seeking orthodontic treatment, affects patients' compliance to&#xD;
      treatment and even becomes the main reason for discontinuing orthodontic treatment. For&#xD;
      years, orthodontic patients have reported using analgesics during orthodontic treatment to&#xD;
      ease the pain. However, analgesics have many side effects such as allergic reactions,&#xD;
      bleeding disorders, gastric ulcers, liver toxicity and their potential influence in slowing&#xD;
      down tooth movement. This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of chewing gums in&#xD;
      pain reduction in Malaysian multi-ethnic orthodontic patients and to explore the possibility&#xD;
      of chewing gum to be recommended as a suitable substitute for analgesics in our future&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;

      Orthodontic treatment have been shown to cause varying degrees of discomforts and pain to the&#xD;
      patients. Fear of pain has contributed to patients' avoidance of seeking orthodontic&#xD;
      treatment, affect patients' compliance to the treatment and even become a main reason of&#xD;
      discontinuing orthodontic treatment. Patients have reported using of analgesic particularly&#xD;
      NSAIDS and Paracetamol during orthodontic treatment to ease the pain. However, NSAIDS have&#xD;
      been associated with various side effects such as allergic reactions, bleeding disorders and&#xD;
      gastric ulcers had raised the concern of orthodontists. Studies on animals have shown that&#xD;
      NSAIDS slower the rate of tooth movement, hence affecting orthodontic treatment efficacy.&#xD;
      Paracetamol have been reported to cause liver toxicity in the case of over dosage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The action of chewing the gum can produce forces to temporary displace the teeth sufficiently&#xD;
      to allow blood flow through compressed area, preventing the build-up of metabolic products,&#xD;
      thus reduce the pain severity. In addition, non-sugared chewing gum has anti-caries effect&#xD;
      which is very important to prevent caries formation during orthodontic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of chewing gum in pain reduction in&#xD;
      orthodontic patients and to explore the possibility of chewing gum to be recommended as a&#xD;
      suitable substitute for analgesics in future practice.&#xD;
