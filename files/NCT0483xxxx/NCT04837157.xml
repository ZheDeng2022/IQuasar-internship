  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the safety, usability and acceptability of a motorized mobility&#xD;
      assistance exoskeleton. The protocol explores the use of the motorized device during static&#xD;
      and dynamic rehabilitation sessions focused on walking and functional activities, with the&#xD;
      expectation of evaluating the safety and usability of the device in the population studied.&#xD;
      The protocol has been focused on defining how the device can be used appropriately in this&#xD;
      population in a safe and effective manner by rehabilitation specialists. The study also aims&#xD;
      to assess the safety of clinical staff who implement the intervention.&#xD;
