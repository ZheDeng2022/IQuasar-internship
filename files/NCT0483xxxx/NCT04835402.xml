  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is investigating the efficacy and safety of combined irreversible electroporation&#xD;
      (IRE) and checkpoint inhibition in metastatic pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to investigate whether checkpoint inhibition in conjunction with IRE&#xD;
      of a single liver metastasis can elicit a systemic anticancer immune response in patients&#xD;
      with pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult patients, in WHO performance status 0-1, with liver metastatic pancreatic cancer,&#xD;
      intolerant to or progressing on first or further lines of chemotherapy can enter the trial.&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab infusion is given every six weeks for up to six months. IRE of a single liver&#xD;
      metastasis is performed between the first and second pembrolizumab infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Response to the therapy is examined by CT (RECIST) on non-IRE-ablated lesions every 2 months.&#xD;
      Assessments of changes in peripheral blood immune cell composition, tumor gene expression and&#xD;
      tumor infiltrating lymphocytes is performed on serial biopsies and blood samples.&#xD;
