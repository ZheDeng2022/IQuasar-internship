  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Today, to understand pathogenic mechanisms involved in periodontitis remains a challenge to&#xD;
      identify biomarkers or therapeutic targets to improve prevention and screening, as well as&#xD;
      the effectiveness of periodontitis treatments. The aim is to characterize, in vivo, specific&#xD;
      molecular markers reflecting the activity of the pathology, which could lead to&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  improve the knowledge of the pathogenesis of periodontitis;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  determine target molecules involved in tissue destruction;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  determine molecular profiles of patients at local and systemic risk;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  determine therapeutic targets&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this purpose, biological samples will be collected (plaque, saliva, crevicular fluid)&#xD;
      from patients with periodontitis stage 3 or 4 versus patients with a healthy periodontium.&#xD;
      Biological samples will be collected before and all along the periodontal treatment. Gingiva&#xD;
      explants collection will be sampling within the surgical procedures (if they are needed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to investigate tissue and cellular expression of molecular markers&#xD;
      associated with periodontal destruction during periodontitis in relation to periodontal&#xD;
      infection and systemic changes in host response. A characterization of the cytokines in&#xD;
      gingival fluid and unstimulated saliva (Luminex® technique) of patients with periodontitis&#xD;
      versus without periodontitis will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to study the influence of periodontitis on systemic pathologies&#xD;
      via serum analysis of molecules and bacteria involved in periodontal destruction.&#xD;
      Immunofluorescence evaluation of protein expression and distribution (inflammatory mediators,&#xD;
      inflammatory pathway signaling proteins) in gingival explants, characterization of proteases&#xD;
      (MMP) present in gingival fluid and unstimulated saliva (Luminex® technique) and&#xD;
      microbiological analysis of the subgingival biofilm (by quantitative PCR).&#xD;

      Today, to understand pathogenic mechanisms involved in periodontitis remains a challenge to&#xD;
      identify biomarkers or therapeutic targets to improve prevention and screening, as well as&#xD;
      the effectiveness of periodontitis treatments. The aim is to characterize, in vivo, specific&#xD;
      molecular markers reflecting the activity of the pathology, which could lead to&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  improve the knowledge of the pathogenesis of periodontitis;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  determine target molecules involved in tissue destruction;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  determine molecular profiles of patients at local and systemic risk;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  determine therapeutic targets&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research focuses on the characterization of the immuno-inflammatory response involved in&#xD;
      periodontitis. A characterization of the mediators or cells involved will be performed from&#xD;
      biological samples (gingival fluid, unstimulated saliva, gingival explants). The gingival&#xD;
      fluid is composed of serum inflammatory exudate and inflammatory mediators produced locally&#xD;
      in the periodontal pocket. Unstimulated saliva is a biological fluid composed in part of the&#xD;
      gingival fluid that drains into it. It has the advantage of being easier to collect (larger&#xD;
      quantity, collection by any health professional).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a non-interventional, cross-sectional, multicenter, prospective, open-label,&#xD;
      non-randomized study to collect tissue, crevicular, salivary, and serum samples as part of&#xD;
      the patient's routine care in oral medicine departments to form a biological collection. The&#xD;
      samples and the clinical data of the patients (excel file with anonymized data and locked by&#xD;
      a password) will be transferred to UR2496 for their analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited in the oral medicine departments of AP-HP hospitals (Charles Foix&#xD;
      (Ivry/seine) and Henri Mondor (Créteil)) by periodontists in two groups (cases =&#xD;
      periodontitis and controls = healthy periodontium but patients requiring surgical care).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The time-line of the research is consistent with the usual patient management in oral&#xD;
      medicine departments. Inclusion period is 12 months. There is no specific follow-up due to&#xD;
      the research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gingival tissue sampling during surgery of patients will be performed after their inclusion.&#xD;
