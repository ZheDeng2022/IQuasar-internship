  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the present study is to test the adequacy, performance and skin reactivity of&#xD;
      the adhesive tape to be utilized in the to-be-marketed Device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study will examine adhesive hold performance, re-use protection (i.e. adhesive&#xD;
      re-application) and skin reactivity/tolerability of the proposed commercial adhesive tape&#xD;
      (i.e. within the Test Infusor Device; TID). As the purpose of the study is to assess adhesive&#xD;
      performance which does not require activation of the device. Hence in this study no canula&#xD;
      will be deployed (no skin penetration) and no delivery of the drug or other fluids.&#xD;

      An open-label, non significant risk, adhesive wear validation study with 60 adult subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A (30 subjects): Wearing of the Infusor for 5-9hrs followed by assessment and&#xD;
      subsequent removal of the Infusor by study staff with photographic recording prior to and&#xD;
      after removal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B (30 subjects): Wearing of the Infusor for 5-9hrs followed by assessment and&#xD;
      photographic recording of the Infusor by study staff after which the subject will return home&#xD;
      and removal of the Infusor by subject or caregiver approximately 12hrs after placement (±&#xD;
      1hr), when another photograph will be taken. The subject must return the device to the site&#xD;
      and transfer the photograph in accordance with the instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Until enrollment for Group B is complete, study candidates will be asked if prefer group A or&#xD;
      B. Additional inclusion criteria apply for participation in group B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent, screening and enrollment may be performed on the same day (Day 1) Screening must be&#xD;
      performed within 7 days of the Wear phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following signing of the ICF (A or B) each subject will complete Screening activities&#xD;
      (height, weight, brief medical history). If the subject meets all inclusion criteria an none&#xD;
      of the exclusion criteria the subject may enroll.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Wear Phase consists of one (1) wear period of five to twelve (5-12) hours.&#xD;
