    <textblock>
      The objective is to determine the prevalence of visual dysfunction in People with Parkinson's&#xD;
      Disease (PwP). The investigators will administer the: Visual Impairment in Parkinson's&#xD;
      Disease Screen and Revised-Self-Report Assessment of Functional Visual Performance. Patients&#xD;
      seen at Fixel Institute and their caregivers will be invited to participate. Responses to the&#xD;
      2 questionnaires will help determine prevalence rates of visual dysfunction in PwP compared&#xD;
      to those both with and without other neurological conditions.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to identify the prevalence of visual dysfunction among Persons&#xD;
      with Parkinson's Disease, compared to other neurological conditions and controls without&#xD;
      neurological conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected anonymously via RedCap. Patients seen at the Fixel Institute that have&#xD;
      consented to be contacted regarding research opportunities will be recruited via blast email&#xD;
      and advertisement in our Institute's monthly newsletter, the Movement Messenger. The email&#xD;
      and newsletter will contain a link for participation in surveys within RedCap so the surveys&#xD;
      can be completed anonymously at home. Participation will be completely voluntary and&#xD;
      responses will be recorded anonymously. Data will include responses to the following:&#xD;
      screening questions, the VIPDQ (Visual Impairment in PD Questionnaire), and the R-SRAFVP&#xD;
      (Revised-Self-Report Assessment of Functional Visual Performance).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will calculate the prevalence of visual impairment (from the VIPDQ) and&#xD;
      dysfunction in performance of daily activities (from the R-SRAFVP) for PwP and compare this&#xD;
      to the prevalence occurring in other neurological populations as well as the population&#xD;
      without any neurological conditions. Other data are collected so the investigators can then&#xD;
      evaluate potential confounds or covariates. To ensure statistical methods are accurate, a&#xD;
      statistician will be consulted.&#xD;
