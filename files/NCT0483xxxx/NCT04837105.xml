  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral palsy (CP) is defined as a group of movement and posture disorders that cause&#xD;
      activity limitation due to brain damage during fetal development or in the first year of&#xD;
      life. Motor activities, and in particular walking, can be affected by many factors including&#xD;
      sensory deficits, biomechanical and postural limitations, muscle weakness and spasticity.&#xD;
      Theories of gait training guide rehabilitation management strategies. Among these,&#xD;
      intensification, variability and specific training of walking parameters (speed, step length,&#xD;
      cadence) have shown their effectiveness. Delivering sensory feedback during gait&#xD;
      rehabilitation exercises is a complementary approach to improve motor learning during&#xD;
      rehabilitation. On the other hand, motivation is a key factor in the success of&#xD;
      rehabilitation. The addition of walking exercises performed through a serious game in&#xD;
      augmented reality (AR) appears relevant for the rehabilitation of children with CP after&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The serious game ARRoW-CP is based on the latest advances in the literature in terms of gait&#xD;
      rehabilitation protocol but also on the results of a clinical study conducted by our team, to&#xD;
      identify the best feedback modalities to be delivered during the serious rehabilitation game.&#xD;

      This study is a randomized control trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are children with cerebral palsy having a single event multi level surgery. They&#xD;
      are involving in a rehabilitation protocol in the same rehab center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two groups are formed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  control group: classic rehab+children have treadmill gait protocol during 4 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  test group : classic rehab+children have gait training with the ARROW CP serious game.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARROW CP game is developed for augmented reality headset (Microsoft Hololens). It delivers&#xD;
      feedback in real time and with delay on participant gait performance. This game has been&#xD;
      developed by researchers (Fondation Ellen Poidatz, France).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. . To determine the impact on spatiotemporal gait parameters of intensive gait&#xD;
           rehabilitation involving the use of a serious AR game in children and adolescents with&#xD;
           cerebral palsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To explore the effects of playing a serious game on functional abilities&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess motivation, satisfaction and adherence to treatment&#xD;

    <time_frame>6 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Aim of the measurement: To quantify changes in the parameters of walking quality (speed, cadence, step length).&#xD;
Procedure: The patient is instructed to walk for 6 minutes in an unobstructed corridor. The distance walked is recorded for the calculation of walking speed. Fatigue is assessed with a Borg scale and heart rate is continuously recorded.</description>

    <measure>Muscle power sprint test</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Aim of the measurement: To assess the anaerobic capacity of children with motor disabilities.&#xD;
Procedure: The patient is asked to perform six 15-metre walking sprints, with 10 seconds of rest between each sprint. The average and maximum power are calculated based on the speeds achieved during the sprints.</description>

    <description>In this test, the child must walk between 2 poles spaced 10 metres apart following the &quot;beep rhythm&quot; imposed by a pre-recorded soundtrack. The soundtrack includes an increase in walking speed of 0.25 km/h every minute.&#xD;
