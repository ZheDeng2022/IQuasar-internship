    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women. It is an important health problem that has&#xD;
      been increasingly encountered in recent years. With the advances in treatment, the survival&#xD;
      time after breast cancer is prolonged, and as a result, many women face certain diseases&#xD;
      during this period. One of these diseases, breast cancer-related lymphedema, is characterized&#xD;
      by abnormal accumulation of protein-rich fluid in the interstitial tissue, which can occur at&#xD;
      any time after breast cancer surgery or radiotherapy and is a major cause of morbidity. The&#xD;
      aims of the treatment of lymphedema are to reduce edema, prevent the increase of edema,&#xD;
      prevent infections, protect skin integrity, range of motion and limb functions. Complete&#xD;
      Decongestive Therapy (CDT) is recommended by the International Society of Lymphology (ISL) as&#xD;
      the international contemporary standard treatment for BCRL(breast cancer related lymphedema)&#xD;
      treatment. CDT is a treatment method that includes manual lymph drainage (MLD), multilayer&#xD;
      bandaging (Multilayer, short-stretch compression bandaging), exercise, skin care and&#xD;
      compression garment. Compression garments, which are the most important component of the&#xD;
      second phase of CDT, reduce the interstitial pressure of the extremity with the pressure they&#xD;
      apply, and reduce capillary filtration and lymph production. Regular use of compression&#xD;
      garments is very important during the treatment process. It is recommended that compression&#xD;
      garments be worn during all waking hours. The success of compression garments is closely&#xD;
      related to the patient's compliance with the treatment. Patients with lymphedema may need to&#xD;
      wear compression garments for life. Wearing compression garments may have some difficulties&#xD;
      for patients and this may affect compliance and adherence to treatment. The aim of this study&#xD;
      is to investigate the compliance to compression garments and related factors among patients&#xD;
      with breast cancer-related lymphedema.&#xD;

      This study was planned as a cross-sectional study. Patients diagnosed with unilateral breast&#xD;
      cancer-related lymphedema and recommended compression garments will be included in the study&#xD;
      on a voluntary basis, after obtaining their written consent. Patients who have received a&#xD;
      standard treatment and an education about the use of compression garments from a single&#xD;
      center will be asked to answer our 28-question questionnaire about the use of compression&#xD;
      garments. The patients will be asked whether compression garments were recommended or not,&#xD;
      how long they have used compression garments, the type and model of the recommended&#xD;
      compression garment, whether they can buy the recommended compression garment, how often it&#xD;
      is changed, how long it is recommended to wear it during the day, whether it is used for the&#xD;
      recommended time, how long wore during the day, the reasons for using and not using the&#xD;
      garment. Compliance to compression garments and the factors affecting this will be&#xD;
      questioned. Patients who use their garments for the recommended time and manner and those who&#xD;
      do not will be compared in terms of these factors. Patients who used their garments for the&#xD;
      recommended time and manner will be considered as compliant.&#xD;
