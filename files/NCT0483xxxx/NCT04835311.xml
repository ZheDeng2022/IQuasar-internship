  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vaginal laxity&quot; syndrome is an increasingly frequent reason for gynecological consultations.&#xD;
      Patients complain above all of a sensation of excessive vaginal looseness. This syndrome can&#xD;
      be isolated or associated with genital prolapse. Women with vaginal laxity may experience&#xD;
      sexual dysfunction manifested by hypersensitivity during penetration and vaginal gas,&#xD;
      resulting in decreased libido. Among urogynecology patients, vaginal laxity has been reported&#xD;
      in up to 24% of cases, with a mean discomfort of 5.7 (on a scale of 0 to 10). Vaginal laxity&#xD;
      is more common in younger women who have given birth vaginally. Gynecologic examination&#xD;
      usually finds widening of the urogenital hiatus during the Valsalva maneuver, suggesting that&#xD;
      vaginal laxity may be a manifestation of hyperdistensibility or disinsertion of the levator&#xD;
      ani muscles. Campbell et al. noted that vaginal laxity was reported by 38% of 22621 women&#xD;
      attending a urogynecology clinic and was associated with vaginal parity, prolapse symptoms,&#xD;
      stress, and urinary urgency incontinence, reduced sensation on the ePAQ-PF questionnaire. In&#xD;
      an IUGA survey of member physicians, 83% of respondents felt that vaginal laxity was&#xD;
      underreported by patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most common clinical definition of vaginal laxity is a urinary meatus to vulvar fork&#xD;
      distance (GH measure of the POP-Q classification) &gt; or = 4cm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first-line treatment for vaginal laxity is perineal rehabilitation. If this fails,&#xD;
      surgical perineal repair, combining posterior perineorrhaphy and myorrhaphy of the&#xD;
      pubo-rectal bundles of the levator ani muscles, can be performed with the aim of narrowing&#xD;
      the introital vaginal caliber and improving the symptoms of laxity. This procedure is poorly&#xD;
      evaluated in the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the functional and sexological results of surgical&#xD;
      perineal repair.&#xD;
