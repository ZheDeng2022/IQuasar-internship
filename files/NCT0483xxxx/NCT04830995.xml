  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Insulin Resistance is one of the common complications that occur during pregnancy. Early&#xD;
      intervention is essential to prevent the development of the diseaseThere is evidence that&#xD;
      physical inactivity increases the risk of a lot of adverse health problems, including&#xD;
      coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes, breast and colon cancers. It also shortens life&#xD;
      expectancy. Pregnancy is a period in the life of women that is often associated with&#xD;
      decreased daily physical activity and decreased participation in sports and exercise . In the&#xD;
      first few weeks of pregnancy, maternal carbohydrate metabolism is affected by a rise in&#xD;
      maternal levels of estrogen and progesterone that stimulates pancreatic β-cell hyperplasia&#xD;
      and insulin secretion. As pregnancy progress, pancreatic islet cell hypertrophy continues and&#xD;
      there is an increased insulin response to glucose or meal stimulation.&#xD;

      This study was carried out upon twenty multigravida pregnant female between 5-6 months&#xD;
      gestation with IR calculated by HOMA test (fasting blood glucose× fasting insulin) ÷ 22.5.&#xD;
      Fasting blood glucose was assessed by the method approved by (7, 13) .The test materials for&#xD;
      this method were supplied as kits by &quot;Diamond Diagnostics,&quot; while Insulin concentrations were&#xD;
      stated in formerly frozen and defrosted serum samples by enzyme immunoassay using the human&#xD;
      Insulin ELISA kits.&#xD;
