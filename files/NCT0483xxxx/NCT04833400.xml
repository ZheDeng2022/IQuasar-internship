  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      By comparing with traditional aerobic exercise training (TAET), we investigate the effects of&#xD;
      an intelligent cardiopulmonary rehabilitative system (ICRS) on cardiopulmonary fitness and&#xD;
      patient satification among patients with chronic stroke.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cycle ergometer training is one of the common indoor aerobic exercises for enhancing&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory fitness in patients after stroke. However, studies had suggested that&#xD;
      patients may be undertrained for reasons such as a tight time schedule for other&#xD;
      rehabilitation programs and lack of objective evaluation on the training intensity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address the issue of inadequate cycle ergometer training in poststroke patients, in this&#xD;
      study, an intelligent cardiopulmonary rehabilitation system was developed and incorporated&#xD;
      into a bicycle ergometer, allowing dynamically auto-adjust paddling resistance considering&#xD;
      the instant heart rate and cadence, with a goal to maintain the hear rate within the&#xD;
      pre-determined heart rate zone. The purpose of the current study is to investigate the&#xD;
      feasibility of the ICRS in stroke patients and whether it outweighs the traditional feedback&#xD;
      on training intensity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single-blind crossover trial is adopted with 40 participants estimated to be recruited and&#xD;
      randomly assigned to the group A and group B. Group A received training with ICRS while Group&#xD;
      B received training with TAET at the beginning. The intensity of ICRS is set as 60%~80% heart&#xD;
      rate reserve (HRR) which is obtained from cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) at pretest.&#xD;
      The intensity of TAET is set as subjective rating of perceived exertion at &quot;somewhat hard&quot; to&#xD;
      &quot;hard&quot; level. Both groups will receive 30 minutes of training per session, 3 sessions a week&#xD;
      for four weeks followed by a washout period of 4-week break. Subjects are crossed-over to the&#xD;
      alternate treatment afterwards. CPET evaluations will be conducted in a total of 4 times&#xD;
      before and after treatment.&#xD;
