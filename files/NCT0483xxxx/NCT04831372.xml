    <textblock>
      The Direct Anterior Approach (DAA) is a common way to perform total hip arthroplasty. There&#xD;
      are two main techniques to perform total hip replacement through the anterior approach. The&#xD;
      first method is the &quot;on-table&quot; method, which uses a specialized surgical table, called a&#xD;
      traction table. This table involves placing both feet in specialized boots that are then&#xD;
      hooked up to the table, and allows for positioning of the operative leg with aid of the&#xD;
      table. The major limitations associated with the traction table are the need for two&#xD;
      additional staff members and the purchase of said table. The second method is the &quot;off-table&quot;&#xD;
      method. In this method the patient is placed on a standard operating room table and the&#xD;
      operative leg is manually positioned by the surgeon during the procedure . This obviates the&#xD;
      need for the additional staff members or purchase of a specialized table. Both the &quot;on-table&quot;&#xD;
      and &quot;off-table&quot; techniques are routinely used both worldwide and by our joint replacement&#xD;
      specialists at Carilion Clinic. This study will aim to compare the efficiency and efficacy of&#xD;
      performing the DAA for total hip arthroplasty utilizing either the &quot;on-table&quot; or &quot;off- table&quot;&#xD;
      technique. Patients will be randomized to receive their total hip arthroplasty with either&#xD;
      the &quot;on- table&quot; or &quot;off-table&quot; method.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND: The Direct Anterior Approach (DAA) for total hip arthroplasty (THA) has become&#xD;
      increasingly popular in the US over the last decade (Berry &amp; Bozic, 2010). Major limitations&#xD;
      of the DAA with traction table include the need for an additional surgeon's assistant, a&#xD;
      traction table operator, and the purchase of said table. To counter these limitations, some&#xD;
      surgeons advocate for the performing the DAA with a conventional operating room table {Cohen,&#xD;
      2017;Molenaers, 2017}. However to date, there are no studies directly comparing the&#xD;
      efficiency and efficacy of these two techniques for DAA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE: Currently, it is unclear which surgical technique is more efficient and effective&#xD;
      for total hip arthroplasties (THA). We hypothesize that there will be an increase in&#xD;
      efficiency as measured by time when performing a standard operating table (Off-Table) DAA THA&#xD;
      when compared to a purpose built traction table (On-Table) DAA THA. In addition, there will&#xD;
      be less pain and faster functional recovery in the early post-operative period for patients&#xD;
      who underwent an &quot;Off-Table&quot; DAA THA when compared to an &quot;On-Table&quot; DAA THA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC AIMS: 1) Determine whether there is a difference in operating room efficiency&#xD;
      between surgeries after a THA via DAA with a standard OR table versus a purpose-built&#xD;
      traction table; 2) examine whether there is a difference in early post-operative pain and&#xD;
      clinical outcomes when comparing patients who underwent a THA via the DAA with a standard OR&#xD;
      table versus a purpose built traction table. 3) report differences in complication rates&#xD;
      between those two.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS: This is a prospective randomized clinical trial that will evaluate adult patients&#xD;
      admitted to Carilion Clinic undergoing primary unilateral total hip arthroplasty. Off and on&#xD;
      table DAA procedures will be performed by a single surgeon with multiple years of training&#xD;
      and experience in both. Cluster randomization will be performed where patients will be&#xD;
      randomized through scheduling. Demographic data will be collected. Operative records will be&#xD;
      used to record operative times for each approach. Radiographs to assess implant positioning&#xD;
      on postoperative day 0. The primary outcome variables are intra-operative data such as time&#xD;
      the patient enters the operating room, time of incision, time of dressing application, exit&#xD;
      room time, implants used, operative report. For secondary outcome variables, we will assess&#xD;
      at 2 and 6 week follow ups routine Patient-Reported Outcome Measures including narcotic&#xD;
      utilization based on pill count and MEq, and the PROMIS and HOOS, JR. measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPECTED OUTCOMES: We expect that the Off-table DAA technique will be associated with faster&#xD;
      set up, surgical time, and overall room time when compared to the On-table approach.&#xD;
      Additionally, we expect less early post-operative pain in the groin, knee and ankle. We&#xD;
      expect that the patient report outcome measures at 2 and 6 weeks post-op for the off-table&#xD;
      DAA group will be equivalent or better than the on-table DAA group. Finally we expect no&#xD;
      difference in complication rate.&#xD;
