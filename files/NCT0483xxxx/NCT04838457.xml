  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this project is to refine a cognitive-behavioral intervention for&#xD;
      comorbid alcohol misuse and modifiable CVD risk with diverse stakeholder input, so that the&#xD;
      intervention can be deployed within existing VA systems. The intervention will deliver&#xD;
      telehealth CBT for alcohol misuse, tailored and timely text messages facilitating clinical&#xD;
      traction with CVD risk reduction, and a telehealth coaching call to transition focus of&#xD;
      treatment targets. The primary hypotheses of this study are that the developed intervention&#xD;
      will be feasible to deliver, acceptable to Veterans and clinicians, and show signs of&#xD;
      reducing alcohol misuse and increasing behaviors associated with cardiovascular health.&#xD;

      Specific Aims: Aim 1 -Characterize a national cohort of Veterans with alcohol misuse and&#xD;
      modifiable CVD risk, their alcohol services utilization, and clinical outcomes. Aim 2 -&#xD;
      Qualitatively assess barriers to treatment for Veterans with alcohol misuse and CVD risk&#xD;
      across multiple stakeholders. Aim 3 - Use a successive cohort design to iteratively develop&#xD;
      an intervention based on patient feedback. Aim 4 - Test the acceptability and feasibility of&#xD;
      an intervention to reduce alcohol misuse and CVD risk in Veterans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Innovation: This application is highly innovative in its attempt to address for the first&#xD;
      time: 1) perceptions of barriers to treatment in this population, 2) the utility of a&#xD;
      combined intervention for alcohol misuse and CVD risk, 3) multimorbid patient preferences for&#xD;
      timing of treatments for multiple different targets, and 4) the sustainability of health&#xD;
      behavior habits in VA formed by an intervention using &quot;implementation intentions.&quot;&#xD;
      Methodology: Aim 1 will use electronic health records to examine the status of key health&#xD;
      criteria and services utilization among Veterans with alcohol misuse, both with and without&#xD;
      comorbid CVD risk. Aim 2 will use qualitative interviews of both Veterans with comorbid&#xD;
      alcohol misuse and elevated modifiable CVD risk, their providers across different settings,&#xD;
      and systems-level stakeholders to assess current treatment barriers. Aim 3 will employ a&#xD;
      successive cohort design to iteratively test the proposed intervention with rapid and early&#xD;
      feedback from multiple Veteran cohorts. Aim 4 will test a refined intervention based on&#xD;
      feedback from Aims 2 and 3 to determine the acceptability to Veteran patients, as well as the&#xD;
      feasibility of recruitment, randomization, and intervention.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The interventional model takes place in two parts. Part 1 is a successive cohort design in which a small cohort of participants complete the treatment, and provide qualitative and quantitative feedback on the treatment. The treatment process is then revised accordingly. A second and third cohort of participants complete treatment, followed by the same revision process. Part 2 involves a single-arm pilot trial of acceptability and feasibility of recruiting methods, treatment, and measurement of outcomes for participants.</intervention_model_description>
