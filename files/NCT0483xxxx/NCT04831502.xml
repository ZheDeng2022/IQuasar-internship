  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to understand how TAK-906 tablets and capsules are processed by the&#xD;
      body in healthy adults under fasting conditions and also how TAK-906 tablets are processed by&#xD;
      the body when taken with a high fat high calorie breakfast compared to fasting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will require participants to stay at the clinical research unit for about 3 weeks&#xD;
      to be monitored after receiving TAK-906.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-906. This study will compare the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of single oral dose of 50 mg tablet (test [Treatment B]) relative to&#xD;
      single oral dose of 50 mg capsule (reference [Treatment A]) under fasted conditions. The&#xD;
      study will also explore the effect of food on 50 mg tablet formulation (Treatment C:&#xD;
      high-fat/high-calorie meal) on TAK-906 PK following tablet administration relative to the&#xD;
      fasted state (Treatment B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 24 participants. Participants will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      to 1 of the 2 treatment sequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This single-center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to&#xD;
      participate in this study is approximately 60 days. Participants will be followed up for up&#xD;
      to 14 days after the last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.&#xD;
