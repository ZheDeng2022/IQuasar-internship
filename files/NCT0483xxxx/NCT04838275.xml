  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) who are stable on antifibrotic therapy at&#xD;
      least 3 months will be randomized to complete a 12-week home exercise intervention using an&#xD;
      mHealth platform, plus a pre- and post-intervention monitoring period (4 weeks each) and&#xD;
      in-person study assessments.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Contemporary walk test endpoints in IPF trials may under-represent patient functional gains&#xD;
      with antifibrotic therapy, which may be more effectively captured with long-term activity&#xD;
      monitoring. Traditional pulmonary rehabilitation centers create a barrier to patient exercise&#xD;
      accessibility and compliance, which is eliminated in a mobile health (mHealth) exercise&#xD;
      training approach. In this study, 30 patients with IPF will be randomized into one of two&#xD;
      arms. The exercise arm will receive a 12-week home exercise intervention using an mHealth&#xD;
      platform plus pre- and post-intervention monitoring (4 weeks each). The non-exercise arm will&#xD;
      be monitored for the same study duration. The primary end point is change from baseline in&#xD;
      daily physical activity as a number of weekly exercise minutes qualifying as moderate to&#xD;
      vigorous physical activity (MVPA), METS*minutes of exercise per week, and sedentary time&#xD;
      minutes. Assessments will be performed primarily via in-person study visits at week 4 and&#xD;
      week 16, as well as via daily recordings from mHealth monitoring devices.&#xD;
