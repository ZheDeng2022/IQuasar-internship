    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, one-arm single-center phase Ⅱa study exploring the efficacy and safety&#xD;
      of CS20AT04 (HLA-haplo Matched Allogenic Bone Marrow-Derived Stem Cells) in two subpopulation&#xD;
      group of systemic lupus erythematosus patients - lupus nephritis and lupus cytopenia.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic inflammatory disease of unknown cause that&#xD;
      can affect virtually every organ. A subset of SLE patients continues to suffer significant&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality from active disease, with visceral organ involvement. Therefore, it&#xD;
      is urgent to develop a more effective therapy for SLE disorder, especially for&#xD;
      treatment-refractory patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells are known to be effective in modulating immune&#xD;
      cells such as T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, dendritic cells, and Neutral Killer (NK) cells&#xD;
      and treating acute Graft-Versus-Host Disease (GVHD). Also, based on the anti-inflammatory and&#xD;
      immunomodulatory properties, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells have been widely&#xD;
      studied as a candidate for the treatment of refractory immune- and inflammation-mediated&#xD;
      disease, and have extensive experience of use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Half-matched allogeneic bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells, the active ingredient of&#xD;
      CS20AT04 Injection, not only have the potential to differentiate into various mesenchymal&#xD;
      cells but also have various immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects, and thus are&#xD;
      expected to induce and maintain remission of lupus nephritis and lupus cytopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to investigate the following. Subjects enrolled into the CS20AT04 with&#xD;
      corticosteroid taper regimen arm will receive two infusions of CS20AT04(2.0×10^6cell/kg), on&#xD;
      0 day and on 12 weeks post-enrollment. Subjects will return for efficacy and safety&#xD;
      assessments on 3 days, 1 week, and every 4 weeks each post-infusion until Week 24. Safety&#xD;
      monitoring will be continued at 1 year, 3 years, and 5 years post-infusion.&#xD;
