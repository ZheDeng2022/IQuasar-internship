  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to determine whether addition of a longer-acting local&#xD;
      anesthetic to our current anesthetic protocol improves the post-operative pain after carpal&#xD;
      tunnel release. Participants undergoing carpal tunnel release (CTR) will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      to one of two groups: the standard anesthetic or the longer-acting anesthetic. Participants&#xD;
      will not be aware of their assignment. Carpal tunnel release will be performed in the&#xD;
      standard fashion at our hospital. Participants will record their post-operative pain on a&#xD;
      visual scale at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 hours after surgery. They will also record the location of&#xD;
      their post-operative numbness at the same time intervals. The day after surgery, a research&#xD;
      nurse will call each participant to inquire about their post-operative pain scores and&#xD;
      numbness. Participants will also be asked about their consumption of oral painkillers (e.g.&#xD;
      Tylenol, ibuprofen) during the first 24 hours. Participants will be re-assessed 3 months&#xD;
      after surgery to evaluate improvement in carpal tunnel symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who wish to have carpal tunnel release on both wrists will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive one type of anesthetic for the first side and will receive the other anesthetic for&#xD;
      the second side. They will not be made aware of which medication is used for each side. This&#xD;
      will allow us to directly compare the difference in pain experience between the two&#xD;
      anesthetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that use of a longer-acting local anesthetic will lead to decreased&#xD;
      post-operative pain, especially in the first 4-8 hours after surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A research nurse will meet with each patient presenting for outpatient CTR surgery at the&#xD;
      Saskatoon City Hospital procedure room. He or she will obtain informed consent for interested&#xD;
      participants. The patient will be assigned a subject number and be randomized to standard vs.&#xD;
      bupivacaine treatment based on a computer algorithm. Participants will complete the Boston&#xD;
      Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire as a baseline for comparison as well as a brief questionnaire on&#xD;
      demographics. For those patients that are having both sides released during the study period,&#xD;
      the first side will be randomized based on the study protocol and the second side will be&#xD;
      anesthetized with the other treatment. They will be blinded to both procedures such that we&#xD;
      can directly compare their operative experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgeon will draw up and mix the pre-determined local anesthetic (LA) for each patient&#xD;
      based on the randomization protocol. The research nurse (who will be performing all&#xD;
      assessments) and the patient will remain blinded to the type of anesthetic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two types of anesthetic will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 10 mL 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine and 1 mL 8.4% sodium bicarbonate (standard&#xD;
           treatment)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 5 mL 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine + 5 mL 0.5% bupivacaine with 1:100,000&#xD;
           epinephrine and 1 mL 8.4% sodium bicarbonate (bupivacaine treatment)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be anesthetized in the standard fashion, with all 11 mL of LA&#xD;
      infiltrated subcutaneously into the area of the incision. After a delay of 20-40 minutes, the&#xD;
      CTR will be carried out using the standard mini-open approach. Patients will be provided with&#xD;
      the standard post-operative instructions regarding activity and wound care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the procedure, participants will complete a short questionnaire (VAS) about any pain&#xD;
      experienced during the administration of the local anesthetic and during the procedure.&#xD;
      Patients will be sent home with instructions to complete a pain and numbness assessment at 2,&#xD;
      4, 6, 8, and 10 hours after surgery. They will be provided with a form containing the VAS and&#xD;
      the times at which they are to self-administer this pain scoring system. Additionally, they&#xD;
      will be provided with 20 Tylenol tablets (325mg each) and 20 ibuprofen tablets (200mg each),&#xD;
      with instructions to take 1-2 tablets of one or both analgesics every 6 hours as needed&#xD;
      during the first 24 hours. They will be asked to document the times at which they took the&#xD;
      medications, as well as the dosages taken. They will be asked to refrain from using other&#xD;
      types of pain medications, if possible. They will also be asked to document use of any other&#xD;
      analgesics including Cannabis. Any questions will be answered by the research nurse before&#xD;
      leaving clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The day after surgery, at the 24 hour mark, the research nurse will call each patient and&#xD;
      inquire about their pain scores and numbness at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 hours, as well as the&#xD;
      present time (24 hours). He or she will also ask about the number of Tylenol and/or ibuprofen&#xD;
      pills taken during the first 24 hours, as well as the timing of consumption. This information&#xD;
      recorded on a password-protected datasheet which contains only the subject number (no&#xD;
      identifiers).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will return for their standard follow-ups. At 3 months, the research nurse will&#xD;
      repeat the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire to assess outcome. At this time, if the patient&#xD;
      wishes, they may be unblinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients wishing for bilateral CTR, the first will be performed according to the&#xD;
      randomization protocol as described above. The contralateral CTR will be performed 2-8 weeks&#xD;
      later (as standard in our practice), with the alternate anesthetic (e.g. first CTR with&#xD;
      standard treatment, second CTR with bupivacaine treatment). The same post-operative&#xD;
      assessment will be performed for the second CTR. Patients will remain blinded to their type&#xD;
      of anesthetic in each wrist until 3 months after the second surgery is performed. At that&#xD;
      time, they will be asked by the research nurse whether the first or second surgery provided a&#xD;
      better pain experience. Only after this will they be unblinded, if desired.&#xD;
