      the investigators intend to analyze the microbiome in the diseased areas, healthy skin and&#xD;
      fecal samples. In addition, the investigators plan to evaluate how the fecal transplant can&#xD;
      influence the severity of the disease and hair growth, all in hope that fecal transplant can&#xD;
      help to treat or even cure AA. This may help dermatologists in the future and expand the&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alopecia areata (AA) is a common autoimmune disease that triggers non scarring hair loss in&#xD;
      different severities. Usually the hair loss will be contained to the scalp and / or beard,&#xD;
      but in some cases, there will be total hair loss from the entire scalp (alopecia totalis), or&#xD;
      complete loss of all body, facial and scalp hair (alopecia universalis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      AA is an autoimmune disease that produces an inflammation surrounding the hair follicles,&#xD;
      this leads to temporary hair loss. In cases the disease become chronic, the immune system&#xD;
      attack may lead to a permanent hair loss. This common hair disease has a significant impact&#xD;
      on the patient's quality of life, it can cause impairment on the patient's confidence,&#xD;
      self-esteem, lead to depression and more.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lately two patients with AA and clostridium difficile infection were treated with fecal&#xD;
      transplantation for their infection (Rebello et al. 2017). After the transplant a significant&#xD;
      improvement was notice in hair growth. These 2 cases raised the option that a fecal&#xD;
      transplant may have an additional effect on the autoimmune reaction against the hair follicle&#xD;
      in AA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      the investigators intend to analyze the microbiome in the diseased areas, healthy skin and&#xD;
      fecal samples. In addition, the investigators plan to evaluate how the fecal transplant can&#xD;
      influence the severity of the disease and hair growth, all in hope that fecal transplant can&#xD;
      help to treat or even cure AA. This may help dermatologists in the future and expand the&#xD;
      treatment options for AA.&#xD;

Prior the beginning of the study all subjects will undergo:&#xD;
Complete physical examination Clinical image of involved locations will be taken Estimating the severity of the disease Microbiome samples Blood sample&#xD;
The patients with AA will undergo randomization into two groups. Group 1 - the subjects will receive a complete fecal transplant course. Group 2 - the subjects will receive placebo.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Severity alopecia tool score - SALT score I</measure>
    <time_frame>up to1 year after fecal transplantation</time_frame>
    <description>The SALT score I (Olsen, 2004) is a global severity score that captures percentage hair loss.&#xD;
The scalp area is divided into 4 quadrants - Left (L) Right (R) Back (B) Top (T). Photographs taken of the four views of the scalp. The percentage of hair loss in any one of the four views (areas) of the scalp = the percentage hair loss X percent surface area of the scalp in that area.&#xD;
left side view = ALOPECIA% x 18%&#xD;
right side view = ALOPECIA% x 18%&#xD;
top of scalp = ALOPECIA% x 40%&#xD;
back of scalp = ALOPECIA% x 24% The SUM of all equals the score. (possible score range: 0-100)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Alopecia Areata Progression Index, AAPI</measure>
    <time_frame>up to1 year after fecal transplantation</time_frame>
    <description>formula for the total AAPI score (possible score range: 0-600). The scalp area is divided into 4 quadrants - Left (L) Right (R) Back (B) Top (T) using the Olsen/Canfield tool. The percent alopecic area (%AA) and score of hair loss activity (SL) is determined in each quadrant.&#xD;
The %AA is defined as the percentage of alopecic area in each compartment. SL is calculated as the sum of the results of hair pull tests (2 = positive, excessive, i.e. &gt;20% of grasped hairs; 1 = positive, not excessive, 10-20%; 0 = negative, &lt;10%) and the magnification findings associated with hair loss activity such as exclamation mark hairs, broken hairs and black dots (4 = ≥50%, 2 = &lt;50%, 0 = 0%) in each quadrant.&#xD;
The total AAPI score is calculated by the following formula:&#xD;
[%AA(L) × SL(L) × 0.18] + [%AA(R) × SL(R) × 0.18] + [%AA(T) × SL(T) × 0.4] + [%AA(B) × SL(B) × 0.24].&#xD;

    <description>Healthy donors will be selected by the fecal transplant unit, in Tel-Aviv medical center. The treatment will be given in the form of fecal capsule. Each capsule will contain a double capsule with 2 layers to ensure that the fecal material will be contained. The treatments will include 30 capsules for the first treatment, that will be taken in two consecutive days, each day 15 capsules. The second, third and fourth treatments will all include 15 fecal capsules. There will be 2 weeks intervals between each treatment.</description>
