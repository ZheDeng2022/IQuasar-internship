  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pediatric Liver transplantation surgery is associated with moderate to severe postoperative&#xD;
      pain that is related to large abdominal incision cutting muscles and fascia and the anterior&#xD;
      abdominal wall and drains. Peri-operative pain management after this surgery is centered on&#xD;
      intravenous opioids, which cannot provide complete pain relief and are responsible for side&#xD;
      effects such as vomiting or respiratory depression. Fifty-two per cent of pediatric patients&#xD;
      reported moderate to severe pain on the day of surgery and 33% on day 1. 42% of patients&#xD;
      reported vomiting. Increasing interest has focused on opioid sparing analgesic strategies to&#xD;
      avoid some of the detrimental side effects of opioids. Recently, the focus has been on&#xD;
      postoperative regional analgesia after major pediatric in major thoracic or abdominal&#xD;
      surgeries. Thoracic epidural anesthesia or paravertebral blocks are efficacious but raise&#xD;
      some concerns related to their potential complications especially in Liver transplantation&#xD;
      with the risk of coagulation disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Erector spinae plane block (ESPB) is an interfascial plane block whereby Local anesthestic&#xD;
      (LA) is injected beneath the iliocostalis, longissimus, and spinalis muscles to achieve multi&#xD;
      metameric analgesia for pediatric thoracic, cardiac, or abdominal surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Its effect appears to be due to local LA spread close to the paravertebral space, reaching&#xD;
      the dorsal and ventral rami of the thoracic spinal nerves that cover dermatomes, which&#xD;
      include the midline sternotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal of ESPB is optimally to achieve LA diffusion to the thoracic paravertebral&#xD;
      space when the LA solution is located in between the erector spinae muscles and the&#xD;
      paravertebral compartment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is robust evidence to support the use of immediate postoperative ventilation in liver&#xD;
      transplant recipients. There is no evidence, however, to show that routine ventilation of all&#xD;
      transplant recipients provides outcomes that are as good as those documented in extubated&#xD;
      patients. It is probably time to turn the evidentiary tables around and ask proponents of&#xD;
      routine ventilation to prove that they have done no harm and that they meet the new minimal&#xD;
      performance standards established by immediate postoperative extubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators' hypothesis is with efficient peri operative regional analgesia will reduce the&#xD;
      opioids consumption, allow a very early extubation after such long surgeries and improve the&#xD;
      quality of recovery by reducing the side effects of opioids as sedation. nausea vomiting&#xD;
      delay of first intake.&#xD;

      1. Goals:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Compare quality of analgesia and quality of recovery between bilateral ESP bilateral&#xD;
           catheters versus Opioid analgesia in paediatric patients for liver transplantation&#xD;
           reduce the peri operative opioid consumption&#xD;

&#xD;
                  -  After surgery performed&#xD;
&#xD;
                       -  Large volume implanted with a need of post operative controlled&#xD;
                          ventilation&#xD;
&#xD;
                       -  Organ failure&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Unstable patient&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Study design: Prospective Randomized Controlled Trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients who agree to join the study will be randomized into 2 groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Group 1 (Control group): standard of care in Liver Transplantation for paediatric&#xD;
           recipients: Intra-operative analgesia by Opioid sufentanil and post operative analgesia&#xD;
           by patient controled analgesia assisted by nurse opioid morphine based on the protocol&#xD;
           established by Prof Lee Vinmec transplantation surgical committee Group 2 (treatment&#xD;
           group): Standard peri-operative analgesia for paediatric recipients in institution since&#xD;
           we use regional anaesthesia as first line treatment for peri-operative analgesia&#xD;
           Bilateral ESP catheters with continuous regional analgesia by infusion of local&#xD;
           anesthestic (Ropivacaine) based on the guidelines by paediatric society of&#xD;
           anesthesiologists and based on our recent article published in regional anaesthesia and&#xD;
           pain medicine&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sample size: We expected to reduce the peri operative opioid consumption by 85% for&#xD;
           liver receipt The sample size of 10 patients per group is required to detect such&#xD;
           changes assuming a confidence interval of 95% with a power of 90% and alpha = 0.05.&#xD;
           Considering 20% of drop-out, the total sample size is 40 patients (20 patients each&#xD;
           group)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Project outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Primary outcome correlation between&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pain quality evaluated by&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Opioids consumption The secondary outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time to extubate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time to discharge from Intensive care Unit (ICU) we will create criteria to determinate&#xD;
           when patient will discharge from ICU to go to high dependency In most of advanced&#xD;
           hospital they don't keep a long time patient in ICU and send the patient to high&#xD;
           dependency unit in surgery As in Institution we don't have we will keep the patient in&#xD;
           ICU&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time to discharge from hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time to first intake&#xD;
&#xD;
