  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Increased life expectancy leads to population aging, increased morbidities and aging of&#xD;
      hospitalized patients. The acquisition of frailty leads to worse outcomes derived from&#xD;
      hospitalization, but although frailty has been related to aging, young patients admitted to&#xD;
      Intensive Care Units (ICU) with frailty have also been found to have worse outcomes than&#xD;
      non-frail patients. This unfavorable evolution could be related to the acquisition of the&#xD;
      post-uci syndrome (physical, mental and cognitive sequelae at discharge from the ICU), since&#xD;
      high frailty scores favor this syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of frailty scales on admission to the ICU could provide early detection of patients&#xD;
      most likely to develop post-ICU syndrome, regardless of age, and redirect our care to those&#xD;
      who need it most. Some scales that measure frailty in elderly patients have been used in the&#xD;
      ICU, but although they have been validated in their original language, they need to be&#xD;
      adapted and validated in Spanish.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives. Adaptation and validation of the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) and the FRAIL Scale&#xD;
      in ICU patients of different ages, in women and in men.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology. Study developed in two phases.Phase 1, adaptation to Spanish of the scales&#xD;
      (translation, pilot, back-translation, correlation); Phase 2, analysis of their metric&#xD;
      properties (Validity, Reliability, Sensitivity, Minimum important difference) by means of a&#xD;
      multicenter observational study (7 ICUs in Spain), prospective, descriptive, of a cohort of&#xD;
      critical patients with one-year follow-up (at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after hospital&#xD;
      discharge).&#xD;
