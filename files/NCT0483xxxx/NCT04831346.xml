  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a one year followup study that aims to assess the efficacy of low level laser therapy&#xD;
      (LLLT) on pain, mouth opening and masticatory muscle activity in cases of temporomandibular&#xD;
      dysfunction (TMD) as compared to soft occlusive splints.&#xD;

      A prospective, parallel randomized, controlled study will be conducted at the outpatient&#xD;
      university clinic. Participant recruitment started following approval from the Ethics&#xD;
      Committee .The patients will participate in the study after signing an informed consent form&#xD;
      prior to data collection. Per inclusion criteria, subjects included are females less than 30&#xD;
      years of age, diagnosed with unilateral arthrogenous TMD, having complete permanent dentition&#xD;
      and showing normal occlusion. Prior to participating in any study-related procedures,&#xD;
      participants read and signed the informed consent form approved by the Institutional Review&#xD;
      Board. Participants will be divided into three groups; three groups: LLLT (Group A); soft&#xD;
      occlusive splint therapy OST (Group B); waitlist as controls (Group C).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: TMJ opening index (TOI), VAS, sEMG. Participants were not given information&#xD;
      on which treatment they were receiving; they were only told that they could receive one of&#xD;
      two different treatment techniques. Sessions were scheduled 3 days a week (every other day)&#xD;
      for a total of 10 sessions&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Parallel Assignment A prospective, parallel-group, randomized clinical trial participants will be randomly assigned to the control group or one of the 2 intervention groups. One group received low level laser therapy (gallium arsenide diode ) while the other received the soft occusive splint. The control group was considered as a wait list for laser treatment aand did not recieve any treatment during the intervention period.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>baseline (pre-treatment) / after 3 weeks / and after 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Active and passive mouth opening will be assessed by a Boley gauge (Electronic Digital Caliper, CE Company, Japan)&#xD;
TOI= Passive opening mm -Maximum voluntary opening mm X 100 Passive opening mm +Maximum voluntary opening mm</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>change in surface EMG (sEMG):</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline (pre-treatment) / after 3 weeks / and after 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>For recording, a surface electromyograph (Myotronics-Noromed, Inc., Tukwila WA, USA), with 8-channels, simultaneous acquisition, common grounding to all channels, and filters of 50 Hz electromyography with disposable electrodes will be used.&#xD;
Subjects will be seated on chairs with back and head rests to allow assessment from a relaxed position.&#xD;
The right masseter (RM), left masseter (LM), right anterior temporal (RAT), left anterior temporal (LAT), right sternocleidomastoid (RSM), and left sternocleidomastoid (LSM) muscles were recorded. The sEMG recordings and muscle activity will be expressed as the root mean square (rms) of the amplitude, expressed in µV.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline (pre-treatment) / after 3 weeks / and after 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The pain VAS is a reliable measure of pain intensity with a 10 centimeters (100 mm) continuous scale attached by 2 verbal descriptors, one for each symptom extreme.&#xD;
For pain intensity, the scale is most anchored by &quot;no pain&quot; (score of 0) and &quot;pain as bad as it could be&quot; or &quot;worst imaginable pain&quot; (score of 100).&#xD;
The VAS only requires the ability to use a ruler to measure the distance to determine a score.</description>

The Masseter and Temporalis muscles will be bilaterally assessed with constant pressure to define tenderness.&#xD;
LLLT applied perpendicular to each tender point of the intended muscles for 10 seconds with an energy density of 2.5 J/cm2.&#xD;

    <description>A soft occlusal splint (vacuum-formed ) made from a 2-mm-thick elastic rubber sheets will be used.&#xD;
Splints were individually designed ( in the out patient clinic of the college of dentistry) for the upper arch of each patient. An alginate imprint of the maxillary arch will be taken to fabricate a master cast of the maxilla.&#xD;
A vacuum pressure device was utilized for molding the rubber sheets (13 x 13 cm /2-mm thickness).&#xD;
Sheets were removed after it has been appropriately adjusted to the mold in the vacuum former. Edges will be properly trimmed, and the palate part is detached to obtain the end shape.&#xD;
Participants are instructed to wear the splint at all times except during mealtimes and oral hygiene.</description>
