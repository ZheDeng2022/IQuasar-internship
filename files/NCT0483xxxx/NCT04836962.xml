  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypospadias is a congenital malformation that occurs in an embryological process, and occurs&#xD;
      with an incidence of about 1/300 in male children. The caudal block was the most commonly&#xD;
      performed method for pain control after hypospadias surgery, and showed very good analgesic&#xD;
      effect in the immediate postoperative stage. However, the caudal block is a neuraxial block&#xD;
      that has a limitation in its duration with single shot and shows complications and adverse&#xD;
      effects. In recent studies, the pudendal nerve block has been suggested as an alternative&#xD;
      method. In children undergoing hypospadias surgery, the pudendal nerve block showed a longer&#xD;
      duration compared to the caudal block, decreased the use of analgesics within 24 hours after&#xD;
      surgery, and showed higher parental satisfaction. On the other hand, there have been many&#xD;
      studies to prolong the duration of the relatively short duration of caudal block. Among them,&#xD;
      dexamethasone administered intravenously is known to improve the duration of various regional&#xD;
      blocks and reduce the administration of additional analgesics. The aim of this study is to&#xD;
      verify whether a single administration of dexamethasone can enhance the effect of the&#xD;
      pudendal nerve block in children 0.5-3 years of age undergoing hypospadias surgery.&#xD;
