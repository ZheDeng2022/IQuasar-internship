      Aims The study aims to examine the effect of &quot;IHAPIM&quot; program on health perceptions, health&#xD;
      responsibilities, perceived stress level, attitudes towards utiling health care services and&#xD;
      the types of coping strategies of immigrant men.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design This study is a two centre, double-blind, randomized controlled trial. Methods We&#xD;
      attempt to report this randomized controlled trial to comply with the SPIRIT. The study&#xD;
      population consist of 95 immigrant men live at north of Turkey. The study, between March&#xD;
      2020-March 2021 were held in the two district predominantly immigrants. The participants were&#xD;
      randomly divided into experimental and control group. The experimental (N = 49) received a&#xD;
      short-term IHAPIM program (5 week, 1 hr per week, 10 hr in total). Measurements were obtained&#xD;
      during pre- and post-test from experimental and control group (N = 46). In this study,&#xD;
      participants and statistician who conducted the research blinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion The efficacy of health promotion interventions are known. However, the health&#xD;
      promotion interventions for immigrants men performed by public health nurse are not&#xD;
      available. At the same time, the effect of health promotion interventions for immigrants men&#xD;
      are unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impact This study is expected to provide a piece of credible evidence of the the health&#xD;
      promotion interventions for immigrants men performed by public health nurse and efficacy of&#xD;
      health perceptions, health responsibilities, perceived stress level, attitudes towards&#xD;
      utiling health care services and the types of coping strategies in immigrant men group. It is&#xD;
      assumed that health promotion interventions specific to male health and sensitive to the&#xD;
      language of immigrants lead to a beneficial results on health perceptions, health&#xD;
      responsibilities, perceived stress level, attitudes towards utiling health care services and&#xD;
      the types of coping strategies in immigrant men. If &quot;IHAPIM&quot; program perform in practice by&#xD;
      public heath nurse. It can be effectively improve immigrant men's health variables such as&#xD;
      health perceptions, health responsibilities, perceived stress level, attitudes towards&#xD;
      utiling health care services and the types of coping strategies.&#xD;

      This study was carried out in order to examine the effect of the &quot;Increasising Health&#xD;
      Awareness Program for Immigrant Men &quot; (IHAPIM), which was prepared based on the Transition&#xD;
      Theory of Meleis, on the health perceptions, health responsibilities, perceived stress&#xD;
      levels, attitudes towards utiling health care services and the types of coping strategies of&#xD;
      immigrant men.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study, which was planned in accordance with the principles of a randomized controlled&#xD;
      double-blind pre-test post-test control group experimental study, was conducted with&#xD;
      immigrant males between the ages of 18 and 50, living in Canik and İlkadım districts of&#xD;
      Samsun, where immigrants live mainly. The randomized clinical trial was based on the&#xD;
      guidelines proposed by the SPIRIT 2013 Statement. The data of the study were collected in&#xD;
      Samsun / Ilkadım and Canık District between May 2020 and November 2020. Randomization an&#xD;
      experimental group and a control group formed using the research randomizer software. the&#xD;
      program used random numbers to select participants and randomly assign them to the&#xD;
      experimental or control group (total 95 immigrant men). In this study, immigrant men do not&#xD;
      know that they are in the experimental or control group, and the statistician who conducted&#xD;
      the research does not know which data belong to which group. Blinding is done in this way.&#xD;
      The study was completed with 49 men in the experimental group and 46 men in the control&#xD;
      group. The experimental (N = 49) received a short-term IHAPIM program by one-on-one interview&#xD;
      (5 week, 1 hr per week). The data of the study were collected using personal information&#xD;
      form, health perception scale, health responsibility sub-dimension of healthy lifestyle&#xD;
      behaviors scale, perceived stress scale, stress coping methods scale and the scale of&#xD;
      determining the attitudes of immigrants towards using health services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      personal information form; the form was developed by the researcher and consists of questions&#xD;
      involving sociodemographic characteristics (age, marital status, education status, etc.)&#xD;
      health perception scale; Health perceptions of immigrant men were evaluated with a visual&#xD;
      number scale. There is a question on the scale. Information on how to fill the scale as&#xD;
      parentheses information at the end of the question scored between 1-10, which is easy to&#xD;
      understand, which immigrant men can answer on their own ('0' on this scale indicates that you&#xD;
      evaluate your questioned situation very badly, the increase of the score is improving your&#xD;
      assessment of your questioned situation, and the '10' score is shows that your assessment of&#xD;
      your situation is very good).&#xD;
&#xD;
      health responsibility sub-dimension of healthy lifestyle behaviors scale; In measuring the&#xD;
      level of responsibility for an individual's health, the healthy lifestyle behaviors scale,&#xD;
      which was developed by Walker, Sechrist and Pender in 1987 and adapted to Arabic in 1998 by&#xD;
      Hadad et al. is the scale that determines the extent to which they participate in health. All&#xD;
      items of the healthy lifestyle behaviors scale are positive. There is no reverse matter.&#xD;
      Marking is done on 4 Likert type scales. A score of 1 is given for an answer &quot;Never&quot;, 2&#xD;
      points for an answer &quot;Sometimes&quot;, 3 points for an answer &quot;Often&quot; and 4 points for an answer&#xD;
      &quot;Regularly&quot;. Health responsibility sub-dimension of healthy lifestyle behaviors scale 2, 7,&#xD;
      15,20,28,31,33,42,43,46. It consisted of a total of 10 items including items. The lowest&#xD;
      score is 10, the highest score is 40. The reliability coefficients of the scale are α 0.90.&#xD;
&#xD;
      perceived stress scale; The Perceived Stress Scale, developed by Cohen, Kamarc and&#xD;
      Mermelstein (1983), is the most commonly used tool of this type. Chaaya et al. In 2010, its&#xD;
      validity and reliability in Arabic was made. The scale consists of 10 items. It was developed&#xD;
      to evaluate to what extent the individual perceived his life as unpredictable, uncontrollable&#xD;
      or overloaded in the last month. The scale is in the 5-point Likert type (1- never, 2- almost&#xD;
      never, 3- sometimes, 4- often 5- very often), and its four items are reverse (4th, 5th, 7th,&#xD;
      8th items), six of its articles are plainly worded (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 6th, 9th, 10th items). The&#xD;
      lowest score that can be obtained from the scale is 0, and the highest score is 40. The scale&#xD;
      is evaluated over the total score, and the higher the scores indicate that the stress is&#xD;
      perceived high. The Arabic reliability coefficients of the scale are α 0.87.&#xD;
&#xD;
      types of coping strategies; The study of the &quot;Ways of Coping Inventory&quot; scale developed by&#xD;
      Folkman and Lazarus (1980) in order to determine the ways individuals use to deal with&#xD;
      general or significant stress situations, the Arabic validity and reliability was conducted&#xD;
      by Alghamdi (2020). The &quot;Coping with Stress Scale&quot; consists of two groups, 14 sub-dimensions&#xD;
      and 28 items, as compatible and incompatible. Harmonious coping methods; active coping,&#xD;
      positive reframing, planning, acceptance, religion, humor, using emotional social support&#xD;
      support), using useful social support (using instrumental support), incompatible coping&#xD;
      methods; behavioral disengagement, denial, substance use, focusing on the problem and&#xD;
      venting, mental self-distraction, self-blame. The Likert-type scale scored between 1 and 4&#xD;
      does not have a total score. Arabic validity and reliability study of the scale was conducted&#xD;
      in 2018 and the reliability coefficient was found to be α 0.80 in the Arabic version of the&#xD;
      scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      the scale of determining the attitudes towards utiling health care services; Developed in&#xD;
      Arabic by Avci and Korkmaz in 2019 in order to determine the attitudes of immigrants towards&#xD;
      using health services, the scale for determining the attitudes of immigrants towards using&#xD;
      health services consists of 26 items. The scale consists of 4 sub-dimensions: health&#xD;
      awareness, factors affecting admission to health services, delivery of health services, and&#xD;
      access to health services. Answers given to each statement in the scale are in 5-point Likert&#xD;
      type and all statements are positive. Scores obtained from sub-dimensions: between 4-20&#xD;
      points for health awareness sub-dimension; Between 4-20 points for the factors affecting the&#xD;
      application to health services sub-dimension; It ranges between 5-25 points for the&#xD;
      sub-dimension of the way health services are provided and 5-25 points for the sub-dimension&#xD;
      of access to health services. The total scores obtained from the scale range from 18 to 90&#xD;
      points. The fact that the scores obtained from the scale subscale and the total score are&#xD;
      high indicates that the immigrants have a good attitude towards using health services.&#xD;
      Cronbach's alphas in the validity and reliability study of the scale are as follows:&#xD;
      Cronbach's Alpha reliability coefficient of the health awareness sub-dimension (0.63), the&#xD;
      Cronbach's Alpha reliability coefficient (0.73) of the factors affecting admission to health&#xD;
      services, the Cronbach's Alpha reliability coefficient of the sub-dimension of how health&#xD;
      services are provided (0.60), and Cronbach's Alpha reliability coefficient of access to&#xD;
      health services sub-dimension is (0.71). The total Cronbach's alpha reliability coefficient&#xD;
      of the scale for determining the attitudes of immigrants towards using health services is&#xD;
      0.72.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of Data SPSS 23.0 statistical package program (Statistical Package for the Social&#xD;
      Sciences, Chicago, Illinois) was used for statistical analysis and evaluation of the data.&#xD;
      Whether the data showed normal distribution was checked with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.&#xD;
      Mann Whitney U test were used to compare data between groups according to normality test.&#xD;
      Wilcoxon test were used to compare the pre-test and post-test values within the group. The&#xD;
      Chi-square test and two ratio tests were used to analyze categorical data. Significance level&#xD;
      was taken as p &lt;0.05.&#xD;
