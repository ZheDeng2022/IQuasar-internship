  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Honey is super saturated solution containing sugar derived from nectar gathered by honeybee.&#xD;
      Honey is viscus supersaturated solution mainly composed of sugar and water along with minor&#xD;
      constituents such as minerals, vitamins, amino acids, organic acids, flavonoids, and other&#xD;
      phenolic compound and aromatic substances. Honey contents according to percentages are&#xD;
      fructose 38.6%, glucose 31%, water 17%, lactose 7.2%, larger sugars 4.7% and rest of&#xD;
      micronutrients and elemental compounds are 1.5%. Honey enhances wound healing by removing&#xD;
      slough and necrotic tissue from wound. It promotes wound healing by increasing angiogenesis,&#xD;
      granulation and epithelization. Honey possess antimicrobial activity against bacteria like&#xD;
      methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin resistant Escherichia Coli,&#xD;
      pseudomonas aeruginosa, and many other species. It also has activity against some yeast&#xD;
      species such as aspergillus and penicillium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Honey used for dressing will be 'Langnese Honey&quot;. Langnese honey is raw honey / unprocessed&#xD;
      packed as collected, quality and quantity will be same for patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This prospective randomized trial will be conducted in all patients undergoing dressing after&#xD;
      debridement of necrotizing fasciitis wounds. Study will be conducted for 6 months after&#xD;
      approval IRB. Patient will be inducted through emergency department. After debridement,&#xD;
      patient will be enrolled in study via simple random sampling for dressing with either EUSOL&#xD;
      or Honey. Honey quantity for wound will be 4ml per square inch. In patient whose both limbs&#xD;
      involved by necrotizing fasciitis, after debridement, dressing will be done with honey in one&#xD;
      limb and EUSOL in other limb. Patient will be enrolled in study whose debridement already&#xD;
      done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EUSOL is solution commonly used for dressing of wounds. Honey is also used for dressing of&#xD;
      wounds. Honey is a viscous, supersaturated sugar derived from nectar gathered by a honeybee.&#xD;
      Honey enhances wound healing by providing moist environment, antibacterial activity,&#xD;
      deodorizes, decrease inflammation, edema and exudation. Honey increase rate of wound healing&#xD;
      by promoting angiogenesis, granulation and epithelization. Dressing will be done by residents&#xD;
      of our ward under supervision of faculty. At first time of debridement pus or tissue will be&#xD;
      sent for culture and sensitivity meanwhile broad-spectrum antibiotic will be started. Once&#xD;
      dressing will started, wide wound span will be measured and assessed daily for granulation&#xD;
      tissue and removal of slough. Questionnaire will be filled by PI for allergic reaction to&#xD;
      solution, appearance of granulation tissue and hospital stay.&#xD;
