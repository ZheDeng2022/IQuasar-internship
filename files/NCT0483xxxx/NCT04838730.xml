  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CleaRing is intended to reduce posterior capsular opacification in cataract patients. The&#xD;
      device is intended to be implanted together with standard posterior chamber IOL during&#xD;
      cataract surgery.&#xD;

      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a prospective, single-group, single-center, open-label study. Each study&#xD;
      subject will be implanted with a CleaRing device together with SeeLens AF IOL in a single&#xD;
      eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Men and women designated for cataract surgery that meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria and&#xD;
      provide written informed consent will be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 20 subjects will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigational sites:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single-center study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of Subject participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint will be achieved when the study subject has completed a 1-month&#xD;
      follow-up after the implantation of the CleaRing device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will be implanted with a CleaRing device together with SeeLens AF IOL in a&#xD;
      single eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits &amp; Procedures Pre-operative visit: 0-3 months prior to the implantation procedure. The&#xD;
      visit will include the subject's qualification assessment for inclusion/exclusion criteria as&#xD;
      described above. Informed consent must be signed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complete anamnesis will be taken including the subject's medical complaints, medical history,&#xD;
      medication use, and ophthalmic examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical procedure: Standard cataract extraction procedure will be performed under local&#xD;
      anesthesia (at physician discretion) and CleaRing device will be implanted together with&#xD;
      SeeLens AF IOL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up: All subjects will have regular follow-up visits at the following post-operative&#xD;
      periods: 1 day, 7 days, and 1 month. All postoperative visits will include a complete&#xD;
      ophthalmic examination, a record of medications used, and documentation of adverse events.&#xD;

    <measure>VISUAL ACUITY</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Distance (far) manifest refraction and the testing distance used will be recorded on the case report forms. Manifest refraction will be determined using the maximum plus for best visual acuity method. The distance manifest refraction will be done with a distance adjusted chart but not less than 4 meters. The actual manifest refraction distance will be noted on the case report forms.&#xD;
Visual acuity will be measured with either Snellen or ETDRS format charts for distance.&#xD;
Results will be recorded in a LogMar scale.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>SLIT LAMP EXAM</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The slit lamp exam will include the measurement of aqueous cell and flare, and the measurement of corneal edema by a standard grading system. It will also include an evaluation for the presence of pupillary irregularities, iris atrophy and pigment dispersion, degree of posterior capsular opacification and correct position of the IOL and the CleaRing device.&#xD;
For the evaluation of aqueous cells and flare, use a slit lamp beam 0.3 mm wide and 1 mm high, and use the following grading:&#xD;
Cells none (0) = no cells seen trace (+1) = 1-5 cells seen mild (+2) = 6-15 cells seen moderate (+3) = 16-30 cells seen severe (+4) = &gt; 30 cells seen&#xD;
Flare none (0) = No Tyndall effect trace (+1) = Tyndall effect barely discernible mild (+2) = Tyndall beam in anterior chamber is mildly intense moderate (+3) = Tyndall beam in anterior chamber is moderately intense severe (+4) = Tyndall beam is severely intense. The aqueous has a white and milky appearance.</description>
