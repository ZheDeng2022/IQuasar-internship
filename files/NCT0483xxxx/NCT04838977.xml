      This study evaluates the use of web-based educational modules combined with telehealth&#xD;
      delivered therapy for children with post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) after receiving&#xD;
      hospital based medical attention for an injury. Half of the participants will received the&#xD;
      online therapy and half of the participants will receive usual care.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As many as 30% of children develop post-traumatic stress symptoms after an injury.&#xD;
      Post-traumatic stress symptoms can decrease children's quality of life. Psychological&#xD;
      distress may emerge after the child is discharged from the hospital and may go unrecognized.&#xD;
      Cognitive behavioral therapy and graduated exposures are standard treatments for PTSS.&#xD;
