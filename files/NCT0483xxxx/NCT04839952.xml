  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants will be adolescents and young adults (15-25 years of age) who have&#xD;
             completed cancer treatment at Johns Hopkins All Children's Hospital any time in the&#xD;
             last five years. This age range was chosen because it corresponds to the recommended&#xD;
             age range for cancer-related adolescents and young adult studies38.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If the adolescent or young adult patient lives with a parent, other adult family&#xD;
             member, or adult romantic/platonic partner, that person will also be invited to&#xD;
             participate in the intervention as a support to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If the adolescent or young adult patient lives with a parent or romantic partner, the&#xD;
             parent or romantic partner will also be invited to participate in the intervention as&#xD;
             a support to the patient. A parent or romantic partner is eligible to participate if&#xD;
             the patient lives with them at least 50% of the time. The parent or romantic partner&#xD;
             will not receive separate financial compensation for participation. Herein, we use the&#xD;
             word &quot;parent&quot; only because we expect the vast majority of patients will live with a&#xD;
             parent instead of a romantic partner. Patients who do not live with a parent or&#xD;
             romantic partner will participate alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient's cancer treatment must have included chemotherapy and/or radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If a patient's cancer relapses during the study period, the patient's oncologist must&#xD;
             agree to the patient continuing in this intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Potential participants who appear to have cognitive, motor, or language delays, as&#xD;
             observed by research personnel or documented in the medical record, will be excluded&#xD;
             from this study if delays preclude informed consent and/or study completion.&#xD;
             Participants may request that research personnel read all assessment, education, and&#xD;
             intervention materials aloud in a structured interview format, in which case&#xD;
             participants could respond to items verbally and/or by pointing to visual aids.&#xD;
             Because of this option, participants' ability to read and write are not requirements&#xD;
             for participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Because the motivational interviewing component of the intervention is&#xD;
             language-dependent and requires significant time and training for certification in&#xD;
             another language, non-English speaking patients will only be included in this study if&#xD;
             the psychology postdoctoral fellow hired in this study is a native Spanish speaker and&#xD;
             can demonstrate motivational interviewing proficiency in Spanish.&#xD;
