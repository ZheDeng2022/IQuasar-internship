      The current study aimed to assess the analgesic effect of ultrasound guided RSB with&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine in the perioperative period of the surgical site after appendectomy In&#xD;
      comparing only the postoperative outcome&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      laparoscopic appendectomy is one of the most frequently performed pediatric surgeries.&#xD;
      Although minimally invasive, this technique is still associated with a significant amount of&#xD;
      pain and anxiety in children . Indeed, children who are highly anxious prior to surgery tend&#xD;
      to have more postoperative pain, delayed hospital discharge, and higher incidence of&#xD;
      emergence delirium, sleep disturbances, and other mal-adaptive behavior changes that can last&#xD;
      up to a few weeks following surgery . To improve analgesia and decrease postoperative anxiety&#xD;
      in children undergoing laparoscopic appendectomies multimodal approach for pain control can&#xD;
      be employee; Over the past years, the concept of pain management has extended from simply&#xD;
      decreasing pain intensity to optimizing patient's condition. The goal is to decrease pain&#xD;
      scores, stress response that should be avoided in patients, particularly cardiac patients,&#xD;
      together with a decrease in analgesics-related adverse effects like nausea, vomiting,&#xD;
      retention of urine and over sedation. By achieving these goals, we can certainly facilitate&#xD;
      patient recovery and minimize the hospital stay. Improved pain control can be achieved by a&#xD;
      combination of different types of regional analgesia with systemic analgesics. The main&#xD;
      contributor to pain post abdominal operations is the pain from abdominal wall incision .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many procedures were followed to decrease this intense postoperative pain such as, epidural&#xD;
      catheter analgesia, Transverse Abdominis Plane (TAP) block, local wound infiltration,&#xD;
      Patient-Controlled Analgesia (PCA), peripheral nerve blocks, in addition to Systemic&#xD;
      administration of Non-Steroidal Anti- Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) or opioids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Rectus Sheath Block (RSB) is one of these regional techniques that are suitable for&#xD;
      operations with a midline incision or laparoscopic surgery with the main incision at the&#xD;
      umbilical port. A previous study showed the analgesic efficacy of ultrasound guided rectus&#xD;
      sheath block for laparoscopic appendectomy compared to a control group injected with saline&#xD;
      instead of a local anesthetic in addition to the usefulness of traditional local anesthetics&#xD;
      to provide analgesia during the course of the postoperative period is restricted by their&#xD;
      short duration of action. Dexmedetomidine (DEX) has been shown as a valuable additive to&#xD;
      local anesthetics in neuraxial blocks and peripheral nerve blocks leading to prolongation of&#xD;
      postoperative analgesia and better pain control .&#xD;
&#xD;
      . dexmedetomidine (DEX) α-2 adrenergic receptor consists of three α-2 isoacceptors (α-2a,&#xD;
      α-2b and α-2c), which regulate the various pharmacodynamic effects of this drug . The α-2a&#xD;
      receptor seems to promote sedation and anxiolysis in the locus coeruleus, as well as to&#xD;
      generate bradycardia and peripheral vasodilation by stimulation of the cerebral vasomotor&#xD;
      center. The α-2b receptor prevents tremor, generates analgesia in the dorsal horns of the&#xD;
      spinal cord and determines peripheral vasoconstriction. The α-2c receptor modulates the&#xD;
      mental stat.&#xD;
