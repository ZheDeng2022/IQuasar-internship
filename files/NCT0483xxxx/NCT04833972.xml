      Survey experiment to elicit perceived norms about substance use&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Health behaviors and health risk behaviors are known to be associated with the extent to&#xD;
      which one perceives these behaviors as normative. The canonical example of this phenomenon is&#xD;
      taken from the U.S. literature, which has robustly shown that undergraduate students on&#xD;
      college campuses tend to drink more heavily and frequently if they believe their classmates&#xD;
      drink heavily and frequently, irrespective of their classmates' actual levels and frequency&#xD;
      of use. However, there remains little systematic understanding about the best ways to elicit&#xD;
      these perceived norms through survey-based research studies. This randomized survey&#xD;
      experiment compares different ways of eliciting perceived norms.&#xD;
