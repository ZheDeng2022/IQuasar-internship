  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether acupuncture can improve cognitive difficulties&#xD;
      and insomnia in survivors of breast cancer. Researchers will compare the effects of real&#xD;
      acupuncture with those of placebo acupuncture and wait-list acupuncture. This study will also&#xD;
      look at insomnia's link to cognitive difficulties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study participants (receiving real acupuncture, placebo acupuncture, or wait-list&#xD;
      acupuncture) will complete study questionnaires and/or have cognitive testing at Weeks 0, 4,&#xD;
      10, 14 and 26. After the Week 26 visit, your participation in this study will end. If you are&#xD;
      assigned to receive placebo acupuncture or wait-list acupuncture, you will have the option of&#xD;
      receiving up to 10 real acupuncture treatments within the six months after the study&#xD;
      finishes.&#xD;

    <description>measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Cognitive Function (FACT-Cog) instrument. FACT-Cog is a 37-item questionnaire with 4 subscales: perceived cognitive difficulties, impact on quality of life, comments from others, and perceived cognitive abilities. The FACT-Cog perceived cognitive impairment subscale (Cronbach's α 0.94) will be the primary outcome for the study. A subscale score is calculated by summing the 18 items of the subscale. The subscale score ranges from 0 to 72.</description>

WLC patients will be compensated with real acupuncture treatments after Week 26 (end of study).</description>

Average time to complete the patient-reported outcomes (PROs) is 30 minutes, which has been judged to be acceptable with minimal missing data;. 20 minutes of these 30 minutes will be completed during the neurocognitive battery.</description>
