      Survey experiment to estimate drivers of stigma toward people with alcohol use disorder&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite significant advances in scientific understanding of substance use disorders&#xD;
      accompanied by significant advances in treatment and improvements in prognosis, substance use&#xD;
      disorder remains highly stigmatized throughout the world. Previous studies suggest that&#xD;
      portraying alcohol use disorder as treatable can reduce negative attitudes toward persons&#xD;
      with alcohol use disorder. This randomized controlled trial compares the effects of exposing&#xD;
      study participants to vignettes portraying persons with untreated and symptomatic alcohol use&#xD;
      disorder vs. treated alcohol use disorder with complete response vs. treated alcohol use&#xD;
      disorder with relapse, with and without adverse economic impacts. It is hypothesized, based&#xD;
      on prior work, that study participants exposed to vignettes depicting treated alcohol use&#xD;
      disorder with completed response would have the greatest effect on reducing negative&#xD;
      attitudes toward persons with alcohol use disorder, followed by treated alcohol use disorder&#xD;
      with relapse and untreated and symptomatic alcohol use disorder, and that adverse economic&#xD;
      impacts will exacerbate negative attitudes toward persons with alcohol use disorder.&#xD;
