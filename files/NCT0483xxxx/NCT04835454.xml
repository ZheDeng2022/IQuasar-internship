      Prostate cancer is one of the most frequently diagnosed cancers and one of the main causes of&#xD;
      death due to tumors in men . The mechanisms of its carcinogenesis have not been fully&#xD;
      elucidated yet . Prostate tumours remain undetected or dormant for a long period of time&#xD;
      before they progress loco-regionally or at distant sites as overt tumours. The molecular&#xD;
      mechanism of dormancy is yet poorly understood&#xD;

      Currently, early detection of prostate cancer involves mainly digital rectal examination&#xD;
      (DRE) and testing of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level in blood . However, over the years&#xD;
      it became clear that PSA is not a specific biomarker of prostate cancer . Finding out new&#xD;
      biomarkers is pivotal for early detection of prostate cancer, increasing the accuracy of&#xD;
      diagnosis, and reducing the false positives in PSA testing These biomarkers include many&#xD;
      biological compounds such as, microRNAs, small nuclear RNAs (sncRNA), proteins and&#xD;
      metabolites .&#xD;
&#xD;
      PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), a class of sncRNA molecules, are associated with the PIWI&#xD;
      proteins. Moreover, MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are conserved small non-coding RNAs (19-22&#xD;
      nucleotide-long) that mediate post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression, affecting&#xD;
      mRNA stability and translation by binding complementary sites on target mRNAs[15]. Studies&#xD;
      have shown that the miRNAs have critical roles in a variety of biological processes such as:&#xD;
      cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and carcinogenesis. Regucalcin (RGN) is an&#xD;
      inhibitory protein of calcium signaling with calcium-binding properties. It plays a&#xD;
      multifunctional role in the regulation of cell functions. Free amino acids, in biological&#xD;
      fluids can be a reduced invasive method associated to a high diagnostic potential. It was&#xD;
      found that free amino acid profiles vary depending on type of cancer and its stage.&#xD;
