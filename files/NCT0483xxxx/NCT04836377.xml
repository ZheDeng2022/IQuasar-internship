  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, multinational long-term follow-up study to assess the long-term safety&#xD;
      and durability of effect of AVR-RD-02 treatment in subjects who previously received AVR-RD-02&#xD;
      treatment in the GuardOne (AVRO-RD-02-201) study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects participating in the GuardOne study will be offered participation in the&#xD;
      AVRO-RD-02-LTF01 study. For individual participating subjects, the Baseline visit for the&#xD;
      AVRO-RD-02-LTF01 study will coincide with the final visit in the GuardOne study. Subjects&#xD;
      will be asked to return for study visits at approximately 6 month intervals for the first 4&#xD;
      years of the study and then annually thereafter for 10 years (for a total follow-up of 14&#xD;
      years in this study), during which time periodic safety and efficacy assessments will be&#xD;
      performed to assess measures of safety, engraftment, and clinical response after AVR-RD-02&#xD;
      treatment in the GuardOne study.&#xD;
