      This is a multisite prospective observational study to evaluate the clinical sequelae of&#xD;
      symptomatic and asymptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)&#xD;
      infection in the pediatric population, including coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and&#xD;
      multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), and characterize the immune response&#xD;
      associated with these clinical presentations. Participants aged 21 years and younger with&#xD;
      laboratory confirmed history of symptomatic or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection will visit&#xD;
      the study sites for clinical and research evaluations and sample collection at schedules&#xD;
      dependent on time since infection. Participants enrolled within 12 weeks after acute&#xD;
      infection or positive test will be part of the &quot;recovery group&quot; and will attend study visits&#xD;
      at baseline, every 3 months for the first 6 months, and subsequently every 6 months for a&#xD;
      total of 3 years. Participants enrolled more than 12 weeks after acute infection or positive&#xD;
      test will be in the &quot;convalescent group&quot; and will attend study visits at baseline and&#xD;
      subsequently every 6 months for a total of 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Household contacts (aged ≤21 years) of the infected participants will serve as a control&#xD;
      group and will attend visits for evaluations and sample collection at baseline and every 12&#xD;
      months for a total of 3 years. This protocol will establish a cohort of pediatric patients&#xD;
      recovered from SARS CoV-2 infection and a biorepository for evaluation of the potential roles&#xD;
      of host genetics, immune response, and other possible factors influencing long-term outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents or guardians of participants in all cohorts will also be enrolled for limited&#xD;
      participation to complete questionnaires about how the family is impacted by the&#xD;
      participant's health and SARS-CoV-2.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will establish a cohort of surviving pediatric patients with symptomatic&#xD;
      (including COVID-19 and MIS-C) and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection to study the long-term&#xD;
      sequelae of acute infection and the evolution of the immune response over time. Longitudinal&#xD;
      follow-up of this cohort will provide important information about clinical sequelae of acute&#xD;
      COVID-19 and MIS-C, characteristics of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2, genetic factors&#xD;
      associated with long-term outcomes, and the extent and duration of protective immunity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study procedures include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Non-contrast chest computed tomography (CT) or chest X-ray: All participants will&#xD;
           undergo 2 chest imaging procedures, one at baseline and one at the final study visit&#xD;
           (year 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Non-contrast cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): All participants will undergo 2&#xD;
           to 3 non-contrast cardiac MRI procedures during this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Echocardiogram&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Electrocardiography (EKG)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Pulmonary Function Test (PFT)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Questionnaires: To complete the questionnaires will take approximately 25 to 64 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Collection of blood (including for optional genetic testing), nasopharyngeal (NP) swab,&#xD;
           urine, and stool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genetic testing (optional): This protocol involves genetic testing using whole genome&#xD;
      sequencing (WGS) approaches for all participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical photography (optional): Participants may decline photographs or place any&#xD;
      restrictions on their use.&#xD;
