      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of&#xD;
      delivering a personalized, just-in-time adaptive intervention driven by machine learning&#xD;
      prediction of smoking lapse risk in real time.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will have access to a &quot;Dashboard&quot; button in the InsightTM app that displays personalized statistics based on their progress and patterns in the study.The dashboard will update as more data is collected about the participant's smoking habits, starting in the pre-quit period and continuing through the post-quit period. Second, in the post-quit period, participants will receive treatment messages when the machine learning algorithm determines that they are at high risk for lapse.At the follow-up visit, participants will complete a survey to evaluate what they liked and disliked about the intervention, how accurate they thought the app was in predicting their risk, and how useful they found the dashboard.</description>

    <description>At Visit 2, participants will be asked to begin their attempt to quit smoking and meet with a Tobacco Treatment Specialist, who will provide motivational interviewing-based counseling, help the participants develop a quit plan, and discuss relapse prevention. During the 6-weeks of the study, participants will have the option of attending up to 6 counseling sessions with the Tobacco Treatment Specialist, either in-person or via phone or web.</description>
