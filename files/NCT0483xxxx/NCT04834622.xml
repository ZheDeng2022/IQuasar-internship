  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postnatal depression (PND) affects over 13% of new mothers but there is still not an ideal&#xD;
      treatment for all cases. Pharmaceutical and psychotherapy have offered solutions but there&#xD;
      are challenges in treatment uptake and adherence and long waiting-lists for psychotherapy.&#xD;
      Many mothers attend group activities with their babies, some including music and singing.&#xD;
      Community group singing has shown improvement in mental health and singing to babies has&#xD;
      shown improvement in mother-infant interaction and reduced infant distress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this realm, Melodies for Mums (M4M) is a programme based in Lambeth and Southwark&#xD;
      providing 10-week singing and music sessions for mothers with postnatal depression (PND) and&#xD;
      their babies in community Children's Centres or online, according to government social&#xD;
      distancing guidelines. Studies have demonstrated its effectiveness in reducing symptoms of&#xD;
      PND faster than usual care or social groups, and preliminary process evaluations have&#xD;
      suggested its suitability. It has also been identified as a strong way of engaging mothers&#xD;
      from minority backgrounds who are less likely to seek professional support for their mental&#xD;
      health. However, the programme is reliant on short-term grants and has not been implemented&#xD;
      in clinical care. Therefore, there is a clear need to invest more research into this&#xD;
      programme to help it achieve its potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to conduct M4M in a clinical trial aimed at women experiencing symptoms&#xD;
      of postnatal depression in the boroughs of Southwark, Lambeth and Lewisham. The investigators&#xD;
      will collect data on the wellbeing of the women through a series of interviews and&#xD;
      questionnaires and the investigators will also collect biological samples for stress and&#xD;
      immunity markers from mothers and babies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the long term the investigators intend to establish defined clinical referral pathways for&#xD;
      patients from primary (GPs, community, among others) and secondary care (specialist doctor,&#xD;
      hospital clinic) settings. In addition, the investigators will collect further evidence of&#xD;
      the clinical, implementation and economic effectiveness of the intervention.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postnatal depression (PND) affects at least 12-15% of new mothers, with symptoms including&#xD;
      fatigue, anhedonia, insomnia and irritability. However, challenges surround the fact that&#xD;
      there is still no complete treatment solution. Although pharmacological treatment has had&#xD;
      positive results, these are hampered by low uptake and adherence amongst mothers, while&#xD;
      psychotherapy has produced mixed results and has similar challenges around low uptake or&#xD;
      delayed treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, many mothers engage in community group activities with their babies, such as&#xD;
      attending mother-infant play groups. Such activities have been identified as ways of relaxing&#xD;
      mothers, providing good sources of social interaction, decreasing the monotony of each day&#xD;
      and also providing a sense of personal fulfillment for mothers. There is also a growing body&#xD;
      of evidence demonstrating the effects of community group singing on mental health. Singing to&#xD;
      new babies is practised in cultures around the world, and research has demonstrated valuable&#xD;
      benefits such as improving mother-infant interaction and reducing distress in babies.&#xD;
      Listening to music during pregnancy is also associated with higher levels of wellbeing and&#xD;
      reduced symptoms of PND in the first 3 months post-birth, while daily singing to babies is&#xD;
      associated with fewer symptoms of PND and higher levels of wellbeing, self-esteem and&#xD;
      perceived mother-infant bond. Consequently, there is a strong theoretical background to why&#xD;
      singing could support mothers with PND.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While small studies have supported the efficacy of this intervention, the present large scale&#xD;
      study is needed to measure effectiveness and promote the uptake within the NHS, as well as in&#xD;
      order to fully understand the mechanisms underpinning its efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial design and aims: These sessions/activities will be delivered for 10-weeks and the women&#xD;
      will be followed up at 20- and 36-weeks post randomisation. On week 0 (before the start of&#xD;
      the study), 6, 10, 20 and 36 women will either be visited by members of the KCL research team&#xD;
      (to be assessed given questionnaires and provide samples) or will complete online&#xD;
      questionnaires (see table of measures). The end of the trial for a participant will be after&#xD;
      the 36-week follow up, or withdrawal. This is a multi-centre trial that will be run in&#xD;
      locations across London (primarily in the boroughs of Lewisham, Lambeth and Southwark),&#xD;
      specifically in children's or community venues. These venues will be thoroughly safety- and&#xD;
      risk-assessed in light of COVID-19 and adherence to any COVID-secure measures will be closely&#xD;
      monitored by Breathe. In the event that one or several women need to self-isolate due to&#xD;
      confirmed or suspected exposure to COVID-19, the sessions will be delivered to her/them&#xD;
      online via Zoom. This will allow for the sessions to still be conducted in person with the&#xD;
      remaining women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to enrol a sufficiently large sample of women, there will be 12 blocks of the&#xD;
      10-week singing programme in total: 10 intervention blocks will be for the experimental&#xD;
      group, and 2 blocks will be for women in the wait-list control group that wish to take part&#xD;
      in the singing sessions. The 2 wait-list blocks will be offered singing sessions after a&#xD;
      woman has completed the first 10 weeks of the study and no data will be collected regarding&#xD;
      these singing sessions, apart from the control follow-up data that this group is expected to&#xD;
      provide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event that one or several women need to self-isolate due to confirmed or suspected&#xD;
      exposure to COVID-19, the sessions will be delivered to her/them online via Zoom. This will&#xD;
      allow for the sessions to still be conducted in person with the remaining women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event of the artist or the Breathe officer having to self-isolate, a replacement&#xD;
      Breathe-trained artist will be ready to step-in and deliver the sessions. The same will apply&#xD;
      to Breathe staff; there will be another staff member available to be present at the sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims are to explore the clinical effectiveness of the intervention in a larger sample&#xD;
      size than previous studies for scalability (to ascertain whether the initial findings can be&#xD;
      replicated at a larger scale) and to explore the implementation effectiveness of the&#xD;
      intervention, including its uptake, suitability, acceptability, appropriateness and&#xD;
      feasibility (to identify not just 'if' but also 'why' the intervention works and support our&#xD;
      understanding). It will also explore the cost effectiveness of the intervention, including&#xD;
      the cost of delivering the interventions and the balance of benefit for the health sector, in&#xD;
      order to be able to develop strong business plan for the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants and Recruitment process: This study aims to recruit 400 women (and their babies)&#xD;
      that meet criteria on the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Disorders (SCID) for major&#xD;
      depressive disorder and score equal to or above 10 on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression&#xD;
      Scale (EPDS). Participants will be recruited through clinic and the community (including&#xD;
      study advertisement on social media, patient groups and self-referral). In order to recruit a&#xD;
      sufficient number of women for this study in the current pandemic, most of the signposting&#xD;
      will be done through GPs, midwives, health visitors and community mental health teams that&#xD;
      remain engaged with the population despite the pandemic. In addition, signposting via social&#xD;
      media, especially targeted advertising in local women's groups will be another valuable route&#xD;
      for recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The women will be explained the trial, given the PIS and ICF and if consented, will be&#xD;
      randomised (2:1) to an intervention group (M4M singing sessions) or a control group (other&#xD;
      community-based mother and baby activities). This group will be involved in the clinical and&#xD;
      the implementation effectiveness of the study. In addition, circa 30-50 wider stakeholders&#xD;
      involved in the intervention will be recruited by research staff. This group includes&#xD;
      artists, psychiatrists, GPs, health visitors, commissioners and others involved in the&#xD;
      delivery of the intervention. The wider stakeholders and mothers involved in implementation&#xD;
      science research will be provided with a specific ICF and a PIS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures collected: Measures will be collected from both the intervention and control groups.&#xD;
      Participants will be visited at their homes (or online via Zoom if necessary) for&#xD;
      baseline/week 0 and week 10 assessments. Week 6, 20 and 36 visits will be completed online&#xD;
      due to the self-reporting nature of the measures to be captured. If a mother cannot access a&#xD;
      computer/laptop to complete the online questionnaires, these will be printed and posted to&#xD;
      them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to allow for flexibility in the schedule, a +/-1 week variation in the date of&#xD;
      collection of the measures below (apart from week 10, when the window will be weeks 10-12)&#xD;
      will be accepted. These measures will be collected from the control and the intervention&#xD;
      groups simultaneously. The following measures will be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 0 (screening/baseline): baseline demographics, repeated demographics, Brief Life Events&#xD;

&#xD;
      Collection, transportation and storage of samples: Pre-post session saliva samples collected&#xD;
      at sessions from mothers and babies will be retrieved using passive drooling (mothers) or&#xD;
      salivettes (babies) and transported by one of the researchers in the team and used for&#xD;
      cortisol, oxytocin, cytokines and other stress hormones analysis. The samples will be kept on&#xD;
      ice and brought to the Maurice Wohl Clinical Neuroscience Institute (King's College London,&#xD;
      Denmark Hill) to be stored at -80 degree C until analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six saliva samples from mothers (and two samples from their baby, providing consent) will be&#xD;
      collected by mothers at home at awakening, +15, +30+ and +60 min after awakening, at 12 noon&#xD;
      and 8 pm, and used for diurnal cortisol and other stress hormones. They will be kept in the&#xD;
      fridge at home, and then posted or transported to the Maurice Wohl Clinical Neuroscience&#xD;
      Institute (King's College London, Denmark Hill), to be stored at -20⁰C until analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hair samples will be kept at room temperature for short-term storage but will be transferred&#xD;
      to -20⁰C for longer-term storage, until analysis (cortisol and other stress hormones) is&#xD;
      conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples will be processed, analysed and remaining material will be kept for 10 years after&#xD;
      completion of the study. Results will be identified according to anonymised codes and stored&#xD;
      securely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up: Follow-up will be done at weeks 20 and 36, using the questionnaires mentioned&#xD;
      above. Participants' wellbeing will be monitored through the questionnaires and any issues&#xD;
      will be flagged by the KCL or UCL team or by Breathe that will do onward reporting if needed.&#xD;
      No samples will be collected at follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wider stakeholders: a series of questionnaires/interviews will be performed to collect&#xD;
      implementation science data only.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Quantitative and qualitative data collection at week 10 (end of intervention).</time_frame>
    <description>EQ5D-5L (quality of life measure): The EQ-5D-5L essentially consists of 2 pages: the EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS). The descriptive system comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. This decision results in a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state.</description>

    <description>Mothers will start a block of 10-week classes and continue with their group for the duration of the course. Classes will take place in Children's Centres (or online). Mothers will attend with their babies and will sit in a socially-distanced circle on the floor surrounded by soft play cushions and mats. Classes will start with welcome songs, introducing everyone to one another, and involve a range of singing and music activities. Mothers will be required to respect social distancing guidelines. Music activities will include learning songs from around the world and will be accompanied by instruments that the mothers and babies can play together. Instruments will not be shared and will be disinfected before and after the singing sessions. Mothers will also work to write some of their own songs over the weeks. Recordings of the group singing the songs together will be made for the mothers to listen to at home. Classes will be led by professional workshop leaders trained by Breathe.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Our control group will be a 'active' control. During the first 10 weeks (during the study period), mothers in the control group will receive details of other non-music classes available to them in the community (or online if necessary, depending on the programs available at the time and government guidelines) and will receive the same schedule of texts and phone calls to encourage them to join these activities. They will still be seen by the researchers to collect clinical measures and biological samples (including the pre-post saliva samples) and to monitor engagement in other activities. Following the first 10 weeks, the mothers in the control group will be offered a place on the singing programme, but these data will not be part of the study, and they will not join groups with women who are in the study</description>

    <intervention_name>Melodies for Mums</intervention_name>
    <description>Melodies for Mums (M4M) is an intervention that was developed and tested as part of a collaboration between the Royal College of Music, Imperial College London and University College London from 2015-2017. The programme involved weekly singing classes for mothers and their babies delivered in groups of 8-12 in Children's Centres for 10 weeks. A trained artist delivers 1-hour long singing sessions to mothers with postnatal depression (and their babies) for a period of 10-weeks. The sessions are aimed at the mothers, with songs ranging from sound baths to folk songs and songs created by the mothers themselves. Mothers randomised to the intervention will be prompted via text message, each week before the session, to attend these singing sessions.</description>

    <description>Group mother-baby interventions in the community (i.e. baby play, baby reading sessions, baby massage, etc). A list of these activities will be collected from the activities on offer in the community. All the mothers randomised to the control group will be pointed towards these activities, prompted by text messages in line with the prompts received by the mothers in the intervention group. Mothers will be encouraged to attend these non-music based community activities once a week with their babies.</description>
