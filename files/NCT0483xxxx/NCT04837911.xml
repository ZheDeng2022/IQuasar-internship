  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Respiratory diseases (asthma, cystic fibrosis, COPD…) need for the diagnosis and the&#xD;
      follow-up the use of pulmonary function tests. These technics which are used since the&#xD;
      nineteenth century and their discovery by Hutchinson, are now currently performed in&#xD;
      pediatrics hospitals but they require trained personnel. Spirometry can be a difficult&#xD;
      technic, especially for children. The accuracy and repeatability depend on many factors:&#xD;
      equipment, patient effort, supervision and encouragement of a technician. A longitudinal&#xD;
      follow up of measures can be good especially in pediatric populations, where children have&#xD;
      generally more difficulties recognising their symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cystic fibrosis is a severe genetic chronic disease, that affects 1/4500 birth in France.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It's a multi system disease that affects the respiratory system, with a decline in lung&#xD;
      function over the time and consecutive to pulmonary exacerbations, the digestive system&#xD;
      (malabsorption of fat and vitamins) and the endocrine system (diabetes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmonary function is an important clinical indicator of the health of individuals with&#xD;
      cystic fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Close monitoring of patient health with daily recording of physical measurements and symptoms&#xD;
      didn't have a negative impact, home spirometry function test could help detect earlier a&#xD;
      decline of the lung function and pulmonary exacerbations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Frequent exacerbations are associated with morbidity, mortality, accelerated decline in lung&#xD;
      function and a decreased quality of life. They are also a major driver of health costs.Their&#xD;
      early detection is a goal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children with cystic fibrosis have more difficulties recognizing symptoms of exacerbations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Few studies in pediatric showed a good observance in realizing home spirometry, especially in&#xD;
      young patients and those living far from the hospital and with a good satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Daily monitoring of lung function is probably too tedious for children who already have lots&#xD;
      of medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical adhesion of adolescent's patients is often suboptimal, compared with younger&#xD;
      patients. But it's during this period that the decline of the respiratory function is the&#xD;
      most important, with its principal cause: pulmonary exacerbations. Frequent home pulmonary&#xD;
      function test is possible and can improve medication adherence without adding too much time,&#xD;
      but there was no change in the decline of the FEV1 and the number of pulmonary exacerbations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The association of home monitoring of lung function and a symptom questionary (cough, sputum&#xD;
      and dyspnea) can predict exacerbation with a good specificity and sensibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Mir Spirobank Smart is a bluetooth connected device, permitting patients to realize&#xD;
      spirometry at home with a smartphone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The accuracy of the Spirobank Smart compared with a spirometry in a hospital showed a good&#xD;
      correlation (asthma and COPD population), if it's used by trained personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to determine the feasibility of a home respiratory monitoring in a&#xD;
      pediatric cohort of patients with cystic fibrosis and the satisfaction of the kids, the&#xD;
      parents and the team of the CRCM.&#xD;
