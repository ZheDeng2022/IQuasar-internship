  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (PP-NRS) from baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>2 Days</time_frame>
    <description>PP NRS is an 11-point scale (0 to10) where 0 is &quot;no itch&quot; and 10 is the &quot;worst itch imaginable&quot;. Participants will be evaluated by asking to assign a numerical score representing their itch at the worst moment during the previous 24 hours.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>modified Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (mPP-NRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Day</time_frame>
    <description>mPP NRS is an 11-point scale (0 to10) where 0 is &quot;no itch&quot; and 10 is the &quot;worst itch imaginable&quot;. Participants will be asked to evaluate the current intensity of their itch at the time of assessment.</description>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) from baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 8,15, and 29</time_frame>
    <description>The IGA measures the investigator's global assessment of the participant's overall severity of their AD, based on a static, numeric 5-point scale from 0 (clear skin) to 4 (severe disease). The score is based on an overall assessment of the degree of erythema, papulation/induration, oozing/crusting, and lichenification.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of participants achieving the Investigator Global Assessment-Treatment Success (IGA-TS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 8, 15, and 29</time_frame>
    <description>Defined as IGA score of 0 or 1 in IGA with at least a 2-grade reduction from baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence and severity of local and systemic Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 85 Days</time_frame>

             physical/laboratory/vital sign abnormality that would, in the opinion of the&#xD;
