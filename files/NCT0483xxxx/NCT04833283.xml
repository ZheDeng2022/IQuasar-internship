      The aim of the study is to evaluate the effects of intermittent&#xD;
&#xD;
      hypoxic-hyperoxic training (IHHT) to protect myocardium against perioperative&#xD;
&#xD;
      myocardial injury during cardiac surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single-center, randomized controlled clinical trial, which will&#xD;
      involve patients over 18 years old who would be recruited consecutively during pre-admission&#xD;
      consultation at the I.M Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University Cardiac Surgery&#xD;
      Department. All patients with a diagnosis of valvular heart disease, or aortic arch disease&#xD;
      and indications for cardiac surgery, according to the European Society of Cardiology/European&#xD;
      Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Five days before the operation, patients will be randomly assigned into two groups using a&#xD;
      computer-generated randomization table: intermittent hypoxic-hyperoxic training and an&#xD;
      intermittent hypoxic-hyperoxic training control group. For both groups laboratory testing&#xD;
      (specific biomarkers - C-reactive protein, troponin I, fatty acid-binding protein (FABPs) and&#xD;
      lactate) will be performed before training and after the surgery, and the hypoxic-inducible&#xD;
      factor (HIF 1 alpha) would be implemented before and after the trainings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the intermittent hypoxic-hyperoxic training group will undergo four daily&#xD;
      procedures of interval hypoxic-hyperoxic training before cardiac surgery, using a normobaric&#xD;
      device to obtain hypoxic and hyperoxic gas mixtures (ReOxy Cardio; Aimediq S.A., Luxemburg,&#xD;
      Registration certificate in RU P3H 2014/1486). Before the start of the training, each patient&#xD;
      would undergo a hypoxic test to assess the individual response to hypoxia, and to determine&#xD;
      the rate of reduction of blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) with a finger pulse oximeter (Masimo&#xD;
      SET, measurement accuracy ±2%). During 5 minutes the patient will receive air with reduced&#xD;
      oxygen content (12%), through a mask under constant monitoring of the heart rate (HR) and&#xD;
      SpO2. As a safety measure, minimal SpO2 would be set at 82% and maximal accepted increase of&#xD;
      heart rate would be set to +50% of the initial heart rate. When these values would be&#xD;
      reached, the supply of oxygen automatically would be switched to a hyperoxic gas mixture&#xD;
      (35%-40% O2), inhaling of which would be continued until SpO2 reached 100% (even if SpO2 was&#xD;
      lower before the procedure), therefore depending on the rate of saturation reduction, will be&#xD;
      taken 1 to 3 minutes (mean 1 min and 50 seconds). The intention is to create hyperoxic&#xD;
      arterial oxygen tension and not to simply reduce the time required to recover from hypoxia.&#xD;
      Intermittent hypoxic hyperoxic training would be considered successful if there were no&#xD;
      significant side effects during the procedure such as angina pain, loss of consciousness,&#xD;
      severe dizziness or other variants of significant subjective deterioration of the patient's&#xD;
      condition. In the case of successfully passing the test, patients will proceed to the basic&#xD;
      intermittent hypoxic hyperemic training. During the training, the hypoxic gas mixture will be&#xD;
      given to the patient again in intermittent mode, based on the individual test parameters and&#xD;
      alternating with the supply of a hyperoxic gas mixture. One cycle of the procedure consists&#xD;
      of hypoxic and hyperoxygenated intervals, the duration of which will be regulated&#xD;
      automatically according to the biofeedback principle, based on monitoring of individual&#xD;
      values of SpO2 and heart rate. The duration of the hypoxic period ranges from 3 to 5 minutes,&#xD;
      and the duration of the hyperoxic period ranges from 1 to 3 minutes, depending on the SpO2&#xD;
      recovery rate. The total time of the hypoxic gas mixture inhaled during one procedure will be&#xD;
      20-30 min. A final training would be conducted in the evening before the surgery. Patients in&#xD;
      the intermittent hypoxic-hyperoxic training - control group also will undergo four daily&#xD;
      procedures before surgery, using 40 min training periods with simulation of intermittent&#xD;
      hypoxic-hyperoxic training by using the same equipment, the patient receives moistened air&#xD;
      through a placebo mask under constant monitoring of heart rate and SpO2. Only the person who&#xD;
      will conduct the training would know about the patient's allocation to a particular&#xD;
      intervention group, the anesthesiologists and cardiac surgeons will not have access to this&#xD;
      information. Episodes of cardiac arrhythmias, hypotension with a need for inotropic drug&#xD;
      prescription, changes in electrocardiogram, pulse values and blood pressure levels will be&#xD;
      recorded during surgery and the postoperative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be monitored for 7 days in the hospital, and 30 days after discharge to&#xD;
      evaluate the complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Differences between groups will be assessed using the unpaired Student's t-test or the&#xD;
      one-tailed Anova test followed by the Bonferroni post-test. Baseline corrected logistic&#xD;
      regression models will be used to estimate the training effect in relation to primary and&#xD;
      secondary endpoints. Statistical significance will be set at 0.05 to test hypotheses.&#xD;
