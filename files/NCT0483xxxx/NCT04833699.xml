  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative ileus (POI), is an extensively known complication characterized by an&#xD;
      impairment of normal gastrointestinal motor activity after abdominal surgery and may also&#xD;
      occur after surgery at other sites due to non-mechanical causes. [1]. This clinical asset has&#xD;
      been linked to prominent perioperative morbidity with the following financial burden owing to&#xD;
      extended hospitalization [1]. Furthermore, POI can postpone adjuvant treatments, such as&#xD;
      chemotherapy in patients who went through surgery for cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abdominal tenderness and distension, nausea and vomiting, delay in the passage of flatus and&#xD;
      stool, and intolerance to solid food are the prime symptoms of POI [1-3]. It is generally&#xD;
      transient, but if prolonged, can cause surgical incision dehiscence, intestinal anastomotic&#xD;
      fistula, abdominal cavity infection, intestinal ischemia, aspiration pneumonia, and other&#xD;
      serious complications [4-6]. Hence, many clinicians have focused on averting POI. Many&#xD;
      studies have analyzed preventive methods, such as preoperative mobilization of the patient,&#xD;
      adequate pain control, gum chewing, epidural anesthesia, coffee consumption, and motility&#xD;
      agents such as metoclopramide and alvimopan [7-15]. For all the manifold remedy approaches,&#xD;
      POI maintains a difficult clinical challenge that compromises the rapid improvement of&#xD;
      patients who underwent abdominal surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, thermal attempts have been employs for several situations such as inflammatory&#xD;
      bowel disease, chronic pelvic pain, and abdominal pain [16]. It may be used in two different&#xD;
      ways; whole body or local. Local thermal therapy can be carried out by hot pack or paraffin&#xD;
      [17]. It has been demonstrated that local thermotherapy abate myotonia, enhances circulation,&#xD;
      and eases pain by expediting the removal of the pain-producing substance. Local thermal&#xD;
      therapy is widely used for a number of conditions such as pain, nausea, vomiting, and some&#xD;
      bowel diseases in traditional Chinese medicine [18].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only one study has shown that hot pack therapy at the postoperative period has a positive&#xD;
      effect on bowel motility. However, this study has a lot of weaknesses. Moreover, until now,&#xD;
      no study has specifically investigated the effect of the hot pack on gynecological oncology&#xD;
      surgery. The investigators hypothesized that using a hot pack during the early postoperative&#xD;
      period would accelerate the return of gastrointestinal motility. Therefore, investigators&#xD;
      performed a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to assess whether using hot pack whips up the&#xD;
      recovery of gut function after gynecological oncology surgery&#xD;
