  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prucalopride is a medicine used to treat constipation. The main aim of the study is to&#xD;
      measure prucalopride concentrations in breast milk. Other aims are to check the growth and&#xD;
      development of babies breastfed by their mothers who took prucalopride and to check if the&#xD;
      babies had any side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, participants will provide one set of milk samples over 24 hours using an&#xD;
      electric breast pump. Breast milk samples will be collected at home and will be shipped to&#xD;
      the laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, participants will be asked questions during telephone interviews every 2 months in the&#xD;
      first year of their baby's life. They will also be asked to complete growth and development&#xD;
      questionnaires about their baby.&#xD;

Each domain has 6 questions, if the answer is Yes, score = 10, Sometimes = 5 and Not yet = 0. ASQ-3 average = average score of 5 aspects.</description>
