  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many people with substance use disorders struggle with decisions regarding whether to&#xD;
      disclose to others that they have a history of substance use and/or are in recovery. Yet,&#xD;
      these decisions are important because disclosures can lead to reactions from others that harm&#xD;
      or help recovery. For example, stigmatizing responses can harm the mental health of people in&#xD;
      recovery whereas supportive responses can strengthen people's commitment to their sobriety.&#xD;
      We have developed a brief intervention to help people decide whether and how to tell others&#xD;
      about their recovery as well as build skills for disclosure. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      pilot test this intervention and test its acceptability and feasibility as well as determine&#xD;
      if it shows preliminary signs of efficacy in comparison to a control condition. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that: (1) participants exposed to the intervention condition will agree that the&#xD;
      intervention is acceptable and feasible, and (2) participants in the intervention condition&#xD;
      will report higher quality decision making in comparison to participants in the control&#xD;
      condition.&#xD;

      Data will be collected from participants at two time points, spaced one month apart. All&#xD;
      participants will be recruited from the waiting room at a local treatment center. The&#xD;
      research assistant will screen interested individuals for eligibility in person and schedule&#xD;
      study appointments, which may be coordinated with treatment appointments. All study screening&#xD;
      and appointments will be conducted in private spaces at the treatment center. At the first&#xD;
      study appointment, the research assistant will introduce the study, check for questions, and&#xD;
      obtain consent for the study procedures, medical record review, and follow up procedures.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either the disclosure intervention or a&#xD;
      control intervention (i.e., an evidence-based mindfulness intervention). Following the&#xD;
      intervention, participants will complete measures of acceptability, feasibility, and decision&#xD;
      quality. At the second study appointment, participants will again be asked to respond to&#xD;
      survey and interview questions designed to further evaluate the preliminary efficacy of the&#xD;
      intervention. In particular, we will investigate whether participants who completed our&#xD;
      disclosure intervention report better relationship outcomes than participants who completed&#xD;
      the control condition.&#xD;
