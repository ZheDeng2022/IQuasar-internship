  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of our study was to validate the Chinese version of the Sinus and Nasal Quality&#xD;
      of Life Survey (SN-5)and correlation with the incidence of pediatric obstructive sleep apnea&#xD;
      and asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll pediatric patients of rhino-sinusitis and their parents to finish&#xD;
      Questionnaire 1, including Chinese version of SN-5, visual analogue scale (VAS), Pediatric&#xD;
      allergy disease Pediatric Allergic Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire (PADQLQ), OSA-18&#xD;
      quality of Life Survey, and asthma-diagnostic questionnaire . Some patients re-tested SN-5 in&#xD;
      1 week later. After four weeks, participants finish these questionnaire 2, including SN-5,&#xD;
      VAS, and PADQLQ. In addition, the author will invite health children without rhino-sinusitis&#xD;
      disease and their parents to fill in Questionnaire 1. The Chinese version of SN-5 will be&#xD;
      validated to establish its reliability and validity.&#xD;

      From December 2016 to December 2017, healthy volunteers and children with persistent&#xD;
      sinonasal symptoms were enrolled. Guardians of the participants completed the SN-5, a visual&#xD;
      analog scale (VAS) of nasal symptoms, and the Obstructive Sleep Apnea-18 (OSA-18) ; the&#xD;
      responses were used to assess internal consistency, discriminant validity, and treatment&#xD;
      responsiveness. A nontreatment group was administered the SN-5 1 week later to assess&#xD;
      test-retest reliability.&#xD;

    <description>The SN-5 consists of five questions on a 7-point scale that assesses the frequency of the following symptoms: (1) nasal obstruction, (2) sinus infection, (3) allergies, (4) emotional distress, and (5) activity limitations. The scoring system is as follows: 1 indicates &quot;none of the time,&quot; 2 indicating &quot;hardly any time at all,&quot; 3 indicates &quot;a small part of the time,&quot; 4 indicates &quot;some of the time,&quot; 5 indicates &quot;a good part of the time,&quot; 6 indicates &quot;most of the time,&quot; and 7 indicates &quot;all of the time.&quot; Higher scores indicate more severe sinonasal symptoms. One item from a global faces scale scored from 0 to 10 is used to evaluate overall QoL related to nasal or sinus disease. Higher scores on this scale indicate a less severe impact of nasal or sinus disease. The scores from the first five items (1-7 each)</description>
