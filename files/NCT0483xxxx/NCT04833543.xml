  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mobilization, specifically verticalization, has been shown to play a role in enhancing&#xD;
      consciousness. Vestibular stimulation has the potential to influence the neural substrate of&#xD;
      consciousness, but this modality has not been thoroughly explored. The primary aim of this&#xD;
      study is to compare the influence of verticalization with and without vestibular input on&#xD;
      level of consciousness in patients experiencing disorders of consciousness (DoC).&#xD;

    <description>A self supporting robotic mobility device (REX) will be utilized. It is a Class I device, and it is classified as powered exercise equipment meant for anyone that requires use of a wheelchair for mobility who has difficulty with standing and walking. The participant will be supported securely within the device using a pelvic harness, and thigh and calf cuffs. The device will be operated under the supervision of a device trained physical therapist and therapy technician. The participant will be transferred into the device in a seated position. Once aligned properly and strapped in, the participant will be passively moved by the device into standing and walking positions. To provide constant vestibular input, a variety of mobility functions will be performed including standing, sitting, walking, turning, shuffling (side-stepping), and backwards stepping.</description>

    <intervention_name>Tilt Table</intervention_name>
    <description>A tilt table is a table with a footplate that can be tilted at different angles. The participant will lie flat on the table and straps will be placed to stabilize the trunk and lower extremities. The inclination of the tilt table will be adjusted from a horizontal to a vertical position to allow the participant to attain and maintain a standing or partial-standing position. Sessions will be supervised by a physical therapist and therapy technician.</description>
