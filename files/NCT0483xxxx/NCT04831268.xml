  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed at 1. to determined the glycemic index and glycemic load of three mixed&#xD;
      meals and 2. to investigate the effects of these mixed meals on postprandial glycemic&#xD;
      response in healthy subjects&#xD;

7) after 10-14 hr fast, consumed 25g available carbohydrate from D-glucose, three times, in different weeks as reference food along with 250ml water; and 25g available carbohydrates from lentils and lupins, trahanas with tomato sauce and halva with currants, tested once, in different weeks along with 250ml water. Fingertip capillary blood glucose samples were taken at baseline, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120min. The first glucose sample was taken exactly 15min after the first bite of food or drink.</description>
