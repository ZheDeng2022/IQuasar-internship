    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine the effects of the BRACE( Balance, Resistance,&#xD;
      Aerobic and Cognitive Exercise) protocol for balance training in patients with Diabetic&#xD;
      Peripheral Neuropathy. A Randomized Control Trial is being conducted at Railways General&#xD;
      Hospital, Rawalpindi. The sample size was calculated through the open epi tool. A total of 60&#xD;
      patients are divided into two groups, 30 participants in the experimental group and 30&#xD;
      participants in the control group. The study duration will be six months. The sampling&#xD;
      technique applied was simple random sampling for recruitment and group randomization using&#xD;
      the sealed envelope method. Patients with the age of 40-65 years having type II diabetes for&#xD;
      more than 5 years are included in the study. Tools used in the study are Berg balance scale,&#xD;
      timed up and go test, functional reach test, Montreal Cognitive Assessment scale (MOCA), and&#xD;
      force plate. Data will be analyzed through Statistical Package for the Social Sciences&#xD;
      (SPSS), version 21.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      American Diabetic Association (ADA) defined Diabetes mellitus as a group of metabolic&#xD;
      diseases characterized by hyperglycemia resulting from defects in insulin secretion, insulin&#xD;
      action, or both. The chronic hyperglycemia of diabetes is associated with dysfunction of&#xD;
      various organs, especially the eyes, kidneys, nerves, heart, and blood vessels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most common among the neuropathies are chronic sensorimotor distal symmetric polyneuropathy&#xD;
      (DPN) and autonomic neuropathies. According to ADA(American Diabetes Association),&#xD;
      DPN(Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy) is &quot;the presence of symptoms and/or signs of peripheral&#xD;
      nerve dysfunction in people with diabetes after exclusion of other causes. It is estimated&#xD;
      that 60% to 70% of individuals with diabetes have mild to severe forms of nervous system&#xD;
      damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DPN(Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy) causes decreased sensation, proprioception, reflexes, and&#xD;
      strength in the lower extremities, leading to balance dysfunction. Physical therapy&#xD;
      interventions utilized to reduce the balance dysfunction can range from restoration of the&#xD;
      health of the neurons to sensory integration to compensatory strategies. Various treatment&#xD;
      protocols include improving circulation, the guided practice of integrating internal and&#xD;
      external sensory input, education on sensation loss and fall risk, instruction on home&#xD;
      modifications, and introduction of assistive devices to minimize balance dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A systematic and evidence-based search of relevant literature was performed by utilizing&#xD;
      PubMed and Google Scholar as search engines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Search term for the initial literature review was Diabetes mellitus, the prevalence of&#xD;
      DPN(diabetic peripheral neuropathy), causes of peripheral neuropathies and loss of balance,&#xD;
      the pathophysiology of diabetes-related peripheral neuropathy, treatment options for balance&#xD;
      training, strengthening lower extremities, aerobics, cognitive approach. The search was&#xD;
      limited to papers in English preferably published since 2000 with full text available.&#xD;
      Different studies were available regarding balance exercises and their effects but limited&#xD;
      data was available regarding BRACE ( Balance, Resistance, Anaerobic, and Cognitive Exercise)&#xD;
      protocol as a whole in recent years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Balance exercises are feasible and safe and have the potential to improve balance and gait.&#xD;
      These should be used as supportive therapy for DPN patients. Lower extremity resistance&#xD;
      (strengthening) exercises are fairly recommended for clinical use in treating balance&#xD;
      dysfunction in patients with DPN than monochromatic infrared energy therapy, vibrating&#xD;
      insoles, and use of a cane.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previously, walking and weight-bearing were considered contraindicated in DPN patients to&#xD;
      avoid foot ulcers, deformity, or fall risk. Emerging research has revealed positive&#xD;
      adaptations in response to overload stress in these people, including evidence for peripheral&#xD;
      neuroplasticity in animal models and early clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to WHO estimation, a number of individuals approximately 47 million worldwide have&#xD;
      cognitive impairments which will increase to 75 million by 2030. A 2 years longitudinal study&#xD;
      in Korea showed a significant association between cognitive decline and physical activity.&#xD;
      Pain interference may be reduced following an aerobic exercise intervention among people with&#xD;
      painful DPN, without a change in pain intensity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although, multiples researches have shown the effects of particular interventions on DPN&#xD;
      still there is a lack of multi-component interventional studies to show the effects on&#xD;
      balance issues.&#xD;

    <measure>Berg Balance Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To objectively determine a patient's ability (or inability) to safely balance during a series of pre-determined tasks. It is a 14 item list with each item consisting of a five-point ordinal scale ranging from 0 to 4, with 0 indicating the lowest level of function with a total of 56 scores. This scale is interpreted as 0-20 on the BBS represents balance impairment; 21-40 on the BBS represents acceptable balance; 41-56 on the BBS represents a good balance. Measurements will be taken at a base-line, after the first session, at mid-level (4th week) and at the end (8th week).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>TUG test</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Timed Up and Go test (TUG) is a simple test used to assess a person's mobility and requires both static and dynamic balance.[1]&#xD;
It uses the time that a person takes to rise from a chair, walk three meters, turn around 180 degrees, walk back to the chair, and sit down while turning 180 degrees. The scores of ten seconds or less indicate normal mobility, 11-20 seconds are within normal limits for frail elderly and disabled patients, and greater than 20 seconds means the person needs assistance outside and indicates further examination and intervention. A score of 30 seconds or more suggests that the person may be prone to falls.&#xD;
Measurements will be taken at a base-line, after the first session, at mid-level (4th week) and at the end (8th week).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>FRT test</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Functional Reach Test (FRT) is a clinical outcome measure and assessment tool for ascertaining dynamic balance in one simple task. In standing, measures the distance between the length of an outstretched arm in a maximal forward reach, while maintaining a fixed base of support.&#xD;
This information is correlated with the risk of falling.&#xD;
Measurement Interpretation:&#xD;
10&quot;/25 cm or greater Low risk of falls; 6&quot;/15cm to 10&quot;/25cm Risk of falling is 2x greater than normal; 6&quot;/15cm or less Risk of falling is 4x greater than normal; Unwilling to reach Risk of falling is 8x greater than normal. Measurements will be taken at a base-line, after the first session, at mid-level (4th week) and at the end (8th week).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>MoCA</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a widely used screening assessment for detecting cognitive impairment. MoCA scores range between 0 and 30. A score of 26 or over is considered to be normal. In a study, people without cognitive impairment score an average of 27.4; people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) score an average of 22.1; people with Alzheimer's disease score an average of 16.2.&#xD;
Measurements will be taken at a base-line, after the first session, at mid-level (4th week) and at the end (8th week).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument (MNSI) is designed to screen for the presence of diabetic neuropathy. The first part of the screening instrument, the history questionnaire, consists of 15 self-administered &quot;yes or no&quot; questions on foot sensation including pain, numbness, and temperature sensitivity. A higher score (out of a maximum of 13 points) indicates more neuropathic symptoms. The second part of the MNSI is a brief physical assessment (completed by health professionals).&#xD;
Patients screening positive on the clinical portion of the MNSI (greater than 2 points on a 10 point scale) are considered neuropathic and referred for further evaluation.&#xD;
A force plate will be used to measure the postural sways. Measurements will be taken at a base-line, after the first session, at mid-level (4th week) and at the end (8th week).</description>
