    <textblock>
      A double-blind randomized controlled trial design is used in this study. A mixed design of 2&#xD;
      (pollution reduction group vs. no pollution reduction group) Ã— 3 (high intensity intermittent&#xD;
      exercise [HIIT], moderate intensity of aerobic exercise [MICT] and control group [CONT]) is&#xD;
      used. 93 subjects recruited by advertising will be randomly divided into 6 groups: high&#xD;
      intensity exercise group (pollution reduction vs no pollution reduction), moderate intensity&#xD;
      aerobic exercise group (pollution reduction vs no pollution reduction) and Stretching group&#xD;
      (Control) (pollution reduction vs no pollution reduction).&#xD;

      Environmental intervention program In the pollution reduction groups, the air purification&#xD;
      system is used 2 hours before the subjects entered the room to minimize the indoor PM2.5 and&#xD;
      PM10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise intervention program including HIIT, MICT and Stretching (Control) group :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The VO2max of all subjects are measured one week before the experiment. HIIT program: 20&#xD;
      minutes exercise of HIIT (1min of 100% VO2max and 1min of 50% VO2max alternately) and 10&#xD;
      minutes of warm-up and relaxation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MICT program: 20 minutes exercise of 70-75% VO2max and 10 minutes of warm-up and relaxation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stretching control group: 30 minutes of stretching, posture adjustment and rehabilitation&#xD;
      courses taught by professional therapists.&#xD;
