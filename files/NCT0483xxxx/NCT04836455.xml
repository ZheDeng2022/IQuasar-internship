  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to determine whether exposure to vaping&#xD;
      prevention advertisements (ads) reduce susceptibility to vaping among adolescents. Previous&#xD;
      studies have been informative, but they have tended to be one-time experimental studies that&#xD;
      do not replicate the repeated exposures to ads that people have in the real world. This study&#xD;
      addresses this issue by repeatedly exposing participants to vaping prevention ads over time.&#xD;
      Participants will be adolescents aged 13-17 who currently vape or who are susceptible to&#xD;
      vaping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to ad stimuli. They will be assigned to one of two The&#xD;
      Real Cost trial arms-health harms or addiction-or to a control trial arm (probability of&#xD;
      assignment is 1/3 for all trial arms). Participants in the study will take 4 online surveys&#xD;
      over a 3-week period, once per week (At week 0, 1, 2, and 3). All participants will view&#xD;
      randomized ad stimuli based on their trial arm and answer surveys items at each session.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tobacco prevention mass media campaigns are a key tool for reducing tobacco use among&#xD;
      adolescents. While vaping has increased greatly among adolescents, there has been a dearth of&#xD;
      research on effective communication strategies to reduce vaping. This study will test the&#xD;
      impact of advertisements from the Food and Drug Administration's The Real Cost campaign on&#xD;
      reducing susceptibility to vaping in a randomized controlled trial, illuminating whether such&#xD;
      ads are effective as well as what themes are most effective (i.e., health harms, addiction).&#xD;
      The investigators focus on adolescents (ages 13-17) who currently vape or are at risk of&#xD;
      vaping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting: The trial will be a longitudinal online study with 4 surveys over a 3 week period -&#xD;
      1 survey per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment: Adolescent participants will be recruited through Qualtrics, an online survey&#xD;
      panel platform. Interested prospective participants will complete a screening questionnaire&#xD;
      to determine their eligibility. If eligible, Qualtrics will invite them to enroll in the&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed Consent: Qualtrics will obtain parental consent online for adolescents who are&#xD;
      eligible and interested in participating. After parental consent, adolescents will provide&#xD;
      online assent prior to taking the survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: After providing informed assent, Qualtrics survey software will randomly&#xD;
      assign participants to one of the three trial arms. Participants will have an equal chance of&#xD;
      being randomized to any of the 3 trial arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment: Participants in the study will take 4 surveys over a 3-week period. This will&#xD;
      allow for multiple exposures to campaign ads. At week 0, randomize participants will be&#xD;
      randomized to 1 of 2 FDA The Real Cost vaping prevention ad trial arms (health harms or&#xD;
      addiction) or to a control arm (investigator created neutral ads about vaping). In each&#xD;
      condition, participants will view 3 ads at each session, in a random order, corresponding to&#xD;
      the theme they were assigned. At the first session (week 0), each participant will complete&#xD;
      measures of vaping and smoking behavior, and will then view the ads that correspond to their&#xD;
      trial arm. They will complete measures assessing message reactions after viewing each ad,&#xD;
      followed by measures of susceptibility to vaping, vaping and smoking beliefs, and finally&#xD;
      questions assessing demographics. For week 1 and 2 assessments, participants will complete&#xD;
      measures of susceptibility to vaping, vaping and smoking beliefs, and vaping and smoking&#xD;
      behavior. They will then view the same 3 ads from their trial arm and complete the message&#xD;
      reactions measures. For the week 3 assessment, participants will only complete measures of&#xD;
      susceptibility to vaping, vaping and smoking beliefs, and vaping and smoking behavior. Each&#xD;
      survey will take approximately 15 minutes.&#xD;
