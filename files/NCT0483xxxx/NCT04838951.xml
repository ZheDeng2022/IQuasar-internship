  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigator's hypothesis is that a CADe system (ENDO-AID) would improve the adenoma&#xD;
      detection rate in junior endoscopists.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the most common and second most lethal cancer in Hong Kong with&#xD;
      more than 5,600 new cases and 2,300 deaths annually. Colonoscopy with polypectomy has shown&#xD;
      to reduce CRC-related mortality by 53%. However, high polyp miss rates were reported to be up&#xD;
      to 26% for adenomas and 9% for advanced adenomas in standard colonoscopies. Risk factors&#xD;
      included proximal location, serrate or flat lesions, poor bowel preparation and short&#xD;
      withdrawal time (&lt;6 minutes). Insufficient trainee experience was also associated with a&#xD;
      higher adenoma miss rate. A significant proportion of interval CRC was attributed to the&#xD;
      missed lesions during index colonoscopy leading to adverse patient outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a result, various techniques were developed to improve adenoma detection rate (ADR) during&#xD;
      colonoscopies. Techniques including water exchange method, second examination of the right&#xD;
      colon (retroflexion or second forward view)and cap/cuff-assisted colonoscopies were proven to&#xD;
      increase ADR effectively. However, these techniques were operator-dependent requiring certain&#xD;
      level of expertise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, artificial intelligence and computer-aided polyp detection (CADe) systems have&#xD;
      developed rapidly around the globe. These systems can provide real-time CADe by flagging the&#xD;
      suspected lesions to endoscopists, with the adoption of deep learning or convoluted neural&#xD;
      networks. A number of prospective randomized clinical trials reported a significant increase&#xD;
      in ADR in CADe group. The number of adenoma detected per colonoscopy was consistently higher&#xD;
      among different polyp sizes, location and morphology. The ADR increment was particularly&#xD;
      higher for diminutive adenomas smaller than 5mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevertheless, most of the aforementioned studies only involved senior endoscopists for the&#xD;
      procedures. Theoretically, the senior endoscopists were more skillful to expose colonic&#xD;
      mucosa and more experienced to distinguish the false positive computer signals, leading to an&#xD;
      enhanced performance of CADe in real-time colonoscopies. The effect of CADe on inexperienced&#xD;
      junior endoscopists performing colonoscopies remains largely unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this single-blind randomized study, the investigators aim to evaluate the effect of a new&#xD;
      CADe system (ENDO-AID) on adenoma detection and quality improvement in junior endoscopists.&#xD;
