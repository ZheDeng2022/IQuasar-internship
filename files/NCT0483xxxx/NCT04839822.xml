  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to investigate the efficacy and adherence of the digital self-help&#xD;
      programme edupression.com®.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The edupression.com® self-help app is an evidence-based low-level psychosocial intervention,&#xD;
      which a can be used as as monotherapy as first-line treatment in mild to moderate depressive&#xD;
      patients or as complimentary treatment independent of previous therapy response or depression&#xD;
      severity. The two foundations of edupression.com® are evidence-based psychoeducation with CBT&#xD;
      elements, as well as self-monitoring in the mood chart. Evidence for the efficacy of this&#xD;
      approach stems from a large body of literature regarding eHealth (healthcare services&#xD;
      provided electronically via the internet) applications in depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study's aim is to investigate edupression.com®'s capability to improve the illness&#xD;
      course directly by reducing depressive symptoms (primary objective) and indirectly by&#xD;
      fostering illness perception and daily functioning. The reduction of relapse risk and other&#xD;
      preventive effects expected from other studies are beyond the time frame of this study.&#xD;
      Beyond the evaluation of edupression.com®, this study could elucidate the general role of&#xD;
      psychoeducation and mood tracking in online mental health to improve depression symptoms and&#xD;
      adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The primary objective is to test the clinical efficacy (at least 50% symptom&#xD;
      reduction over a 3-month period) of edupression.com® in mild to moderate unipolar depressed&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: The study design of this clinical trial is consistent with a monocentric,&#xD;
      prospective, longitudinal, randomized controlled clinical trial. Patients, currently&#xD;
      diagnosed with a mild to moderate major depressive episode (MDE) will be invited to use the&#xD;
      digital self-help programme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the inclusion procedure, patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to two&#xD;
      different treatment arms (A vs. B). Participants of the intervention arm will get full access&#xD;
      to the edupression.com® website, while participants of the control arm will get access to a&#xD;
      control version of edupression.com® limited to medically useful tips, that have not been&#xD;
      shown to be effective in improving depressive symptoms in randomized controlled trials&#xD;
      (RCTs).&#xD;

As such, detailed risk management documentation includes probability and severity of adverse events. Moreover, detailed strategies such as warnings were implemented in the software and documented accordingly.&#xD;
It can be used on a PC as well as on mobile devices (browser, App) at any time.</description>
