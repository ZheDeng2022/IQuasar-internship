  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators would only include the children who received propofol (Propolipid,&#xD;
      Fresenius Kabi, Schelle, Belgium) for sedation, the investigators would exclude the children&#xD;
      that didn't receive propofol during the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators would analyze the incidence of hypersensitivity reaction to propofol in&#xD;
      children allergic to egg, soy or both egg and soy and to compare those with the incidence of&#xD;
      hypersensitivity reactions in children without allergy to egg and/or to soy. Those data were&#xD;
      retrieved following longitudinal follow-up after the intervention. Allergy tests by skin and&#xD;
      radioallergosorbent tests were performed in all children before the gastrointestinal&#xD;
      endoscopy under anesthesia took place, but no results were known at the time of the sedation.&#xD;
      A patient was defined as allergic to egg and/or soy if the patient had specific S-IgE level&#xD;
      more than the normal level set by our institution (0.35 kU/L).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators would also investigate the influence of other obtained parameters in the&#xD;
      dataset (age, ASA score, weight category, type of investigation, respiratory and neurological&#xD;
      comorbidities, respiratory infections, GERD, other allergies) on those results with&#xD;
      multivariate analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We considered that clinical features suggesting a hypersensitivity reaction present during&#xD;
      anaesthesia were cutaneous, respiratory or cardiovascular manifestations. Depending on the&#xD;
      severity of the reaction, necessitating prompt hemodynamic resuscitation with the&#xD;
      administration of epinephrine, antihistamines, inhaled beta-agonists or corticosteroids.&#xD;
