    <textblock>
      Background: Bikini line laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a safe method, used as a scarless&#xD;
      cosmetic port technique for gall bladder diseases in morbid obese patients as a day case.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study was to investigate the safety and efficacy of an elective Bikini line&#xD;
      laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the morbid obese patients with chronic calcular&#xD;
      cholecystitis, and review our experience with Bikini line laparoscopic cholecystectomy as&#xD;
      minimal invasive scarless technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We issued a modifications in order to minimize the number of ports (Brief ports) and modify&#xD;
      port sites, using the Bikini line laparoscopic cholecystectomy as a cosmetic and hidden scar&#xD;
      laparoscopy for obese patients concerned with aesthetic results and body image. Aiming at&#xD;
      faster recovery, decrease pain and improve cosmoses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bikini Line laparoscopic cholecystectomy is technically safe and effective day surgery&#xD;
      procedure for chronic cholecystitis patients with higher patient satisfaction regarding pain&#xD;
      and cosmoses. Obesity, intended as BMI 40, does not have any obstacle on the technical&#xD;
      feasibility of BLLC.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thoroughly, BLLC is a novel technique aimed at solving the issue of cosmoses that is always&#xD;
      presented as a main complaint from morbid obese patients. The main concern to use Brief ports&#xD;
      laparoscopy or hidden scar laparoscopy to reduce incisions and change sites. The study&#xD;
      designed to identify superiority of technique regarding success as a day case surgery, better&#xD;
      cosmoses and lesser pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We tried to wear off the port sites scar and kept our stabs in the suprapubic Bikin line. We&#xD;
      kept camera port in the navel's natural scar and used the other ports in lower abdominal&#xD;
      crease at Bikini line. Cosmosis has been and still the reason among patient population to&#xD;
      accept the laparoscopic surgery, many synonyms can be applied here, as Cosmotic,Hidden scar,&#xD;
      Scarless, Non-visualized or Scarless Bikini cholecystectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BLLC is performed under general anesthesia. Patient placed in the supine position with&#xD;
      patient's legs apart and arms are rolled in, patient strapped to table at the mid-thigh.&#xD;
      Surgeon stood between patient's legs, the camera man stood on the right side of patient,&#xD;
      monitor placed near patient head to the right side. Three ports were used, 12 mm visiport&#xD;
      (….) umbilical, with A 30 degree camera used, 5mm in Bikini line at Right mid-clavicular line&#xD;
      and third port 5mm in Bikini line at left mid-clavicular line (Figure) Patient kept in&#xD;
      reverse Trendlenburg position with maximum degree 20. But to lesser degree than done in&#xD;
      classic LC,&#xD;

    <description>Postoperative pain was defined as mild, moderate sever according to visual analogue scale (VAS)&#xD;
Pain assessment at the tommy and at port sites were assessed at postoperative day 1 and at discharge as follow, 8 hours, at discharge time at 12 hours or 24 hours postoperative, and after discharge at 48 hours, 72 hours achieved through Telephone call with the patient.&#xD;
Patient satisfaction from cosmetic outcome was measured on 10 points scale. Divided into mild satisfied (1-3 points), moderate (4-7)and highly satisfied (8-10 points) at the second postoperative visit at 30 days postoperative, after 3 months and after 6 months, based on patient question to rate it, mild satisfaction: 1-3, moderate satisfaction:4-7 and highly satisfied: from 8-10</description>
