  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study in adults with advanced cancer (solid tumours including non-small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer and colorectal cancer) in whom previous chemotherapy was not successful. People who&#xD;
      have a tumour with a KRAS mutation can participate in the study. A KRAS mutation makes cancer&#xD;
      grow faster.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study tests 2 medicines called BI 1701963 and BI 3011441. BI 1701963 and BI 3011441&#xD;
      prevent activation of KRAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to find out the highest dose of BI 1701963 alone and in&#xD;
      combination with BI 3011441 the participants can tolerate. Another purpose is to check&#xD;
      whether BI 1701963 in combination with BI 3011441 is able to make tumours shrink.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants can stay in the study as long as they benefit from treatment and can tolerate&#xD;
      it. During this time, they get tablets of BI 1701963 and capsules of BI 3011441 once daily.&#xD;
      The doctors regularly monitor the size of the tumour. Doctors also regularly record any&#xD;
      unwanted effects and check participants' health.&#xD;
