  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The quality of the rehabilitation of deafness in children with cochlear implantation is a&#xD;
      major prognostic factor for the outcome on speech comprehension and oral expression. This&#xD;
      rehabilitation is carried out cooperatively by the hospital cochlear implantation team, and&#xD;
      by a speech therapist located near the child's home. The multi-weekly sessions represent a&#xD;
      constraint for the child and his parents. Complementary training work at home would make it&#xD;
      possible to balance the equity in the distribution of care in the territory, and should&#xD;
      promote the progress of the child, who is more inclined to use a tool available at home.&#xD;

      The humanoid robot should allow an ecological approach to this additional rehabilitation.&#xD;
      Before developing this approach, it is necessary to study the acceptability of the humanoid&#xD;
      robot at home, both by the parents and by the cochlear implanted child. The main objective of&#xD;
      this study is to assess the acceptability by the child and his family, of a humanoid robot&#xD;
      installed at home for one month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to describe the acceptability of the child and his family that&#xD;
      is the relationship to technology, the intention of use, expectations, perceived utility,&#xD;
      perception of the robot and facilitating conditions before then after 1 month of using the&#xD;
      robot at home,&#xD;
&#xD;
      - describe the child's acceptability with respect to his experience, his fun and the emotions&#xD;
      felt when he uses the robot at home&#xD;
