      A Phase Ib/IIa, multicentre, open label, dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, and preliminary effectiveness of intratumoural tigilanol tiglate in combination&#xD;
      with intravenous pembrolizumab in adult patients with unresectable, Stage IIIB to IV M1c&#xD;
      melanoma.&#xD;

      Intratumoural treatment with tigilanol tiglate combined with systemic anti-programmed cell&#xD;
      death receptor 1 (PD 1) immunotherapy may enhance anti-tumour immune responses and improve&#xD;
      outcomes for patients with melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum feasible dose (MFD) level of a&#xD;
      single intratumoural treatment of tigilanol tiglate (Tx1) administered in combination with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. To assess the safety and tolerability of: i) A single treatment (Tx1) of intratumoural&#xD;
      tigilanol tiglate at escalating dose levels (dose-escalation) administered in combination&#xD;
      with intravenous (IV) pembrolizumab (200 mg); and ii) Repeat treatments of intratumoural&#xD;
      tigilanol tiglate (maximum of 3 treatments) administered in combination with IV pembrolizumab&#xD;
      (200 mg, Q3W). Repeat treatment(s) of intratumoural tigilanol tiglate to be administered at&#xD;
      the same dose level at Tx1 as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. If the initially injected tumour(s) are not fully ablated, then intratumoural tigilanol&#xD;
           tiglate Tx2 +/- Tx3 may be re-administered to the same tumour(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. If the initially injected tumour(s) are fully ablated and additional pre-identified&#xD;
           tumours can be treated, then intratumoural tigilanol tiglate, Tx2 +/- Tx3 may also be&#xD;
           administered to those tumours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note: Tumours identified at Screening that are designated as &quot;not to be injected&quot; tumours&#xD;
      (i.e. non-injected tumours for observation) cannot be treated at Tx1, Tx2 or Tx3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate tumour response according to RECIST 1.1 criteria, including loco-regional&#xD;
           control of injected tumour(s) and non-injected tumour(s), and survival in patients&#xD;
           treated in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the safety and tolerability of ongoing treatment with pembrolizumab up to a&#xD;
           total of 35 cycles (Q3W), including the combination with up to 3 treatments of&#xD;
           intratumoural tigilanol tiglate (Q3W).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To evaluate the tumour response of tumours following treatment with intratumoural&#xD;
      injection with tigilanol tiglate in combination with pembrolizumab&#xD;

             study may participate as long as it has been at least 4 weeks after the last dose of&#xD;
             the previous investigational agent). Patients must have recovered from all AEs due to&#xD;
             previous therapies to â‰¤ Grade 1 or baseline patients with â‰¤ Grade 2 neuropathy may be&#xD;

             the patient to participate, in the opinion of the treating Investigator.&#xD;
