      This is a multi-center, 2-arm parallel pragmatic randomized controlled trial that will&#xD;
      compare pharmacopuncture therapy with physical therapy for chronic low back pain.&#xD;
      Participants who voluntarily signed informed consent form and eligible for the study were&#xD;
      randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio (50:50) for pharmacopuncture therapy group and physical&#xD;
      therapy group. Participants of each group will receive total 5 weeks of intervention. This is&#xD;
      a pragmatic randomized controlled trial, so physicians will have medical decision making&#xD;
      according to each participant's conditions and choose the specific type and volume of&#xD;
      pharmacopuncture and physical therapy.&#xD;

    <measure>Oswestry Disability Index (ODI)</measure>
    <time_frame>week 1, 6, 13, 25</time_frame>
    <description>ODI is a functional disability questionnaire. The possible range of each item score is 0 to 5. Total score range is 0 (better outcome) to 100 (worse outcome).</description>

    <measure>Korean version of the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>week 1, 6, 13, 25</time_frame>
    <description>The Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire consists of 24 statements relating to the person's perceptions of their back pain and associated disability. This includes items on physical ability/activity (15), sleep/rest (3), psychosocial (2), household management (2), eating (1) and pain frequency (1). There is no weighting applied to the statements, therefore the score can range from 0 (no disability) to 24 (maximal disability).</description>

    <time_frame>week 6, 13, 25</time_frame>
    <description>Participants rate the improvement after treatment on a 7-point Likert scale (1, very much improved; 2, much improved; 3, minimally improved; 4, no change; 5, minimally worse; 6, much worse; or 7, very much worse.)</description>
