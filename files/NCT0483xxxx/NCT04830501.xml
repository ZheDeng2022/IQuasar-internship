      This is a phase I study of the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics profile, and&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy of TT-00434 in patients with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, First-in-Human (FIH), open-label, dose escalation clinical study in&#xD;
      patients who have a histological or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of advanced or&#xD;
      recurrent tumors that all standard treatments have been used or are not feasible. It aims to&#xD;
      determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for&#xD;
      study, evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD)&#xD;
      characteristics and the preliminary anti-tumor activity of TT-00434, and explore the&#xD;
      relationship between the anti-tumor activity of TT-00434 and the tumor FGFR alterations.&#xD;
