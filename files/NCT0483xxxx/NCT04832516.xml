  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The practice of a physical activity, even moderate, plays an important role in the prevention&#xD;
      and the management of the main chronic non-communicable diseases (cardiovascular diseases,&#xD;
      certain cancers, diabetes, obesity, osteoporosis ...) as well as by improving psychological&#xD;
      health. Several studies have shown that physical activity has a positive impact on the&#xD;
      economy of companies via the reduction of absenteeism and the improvement of productivity.&#xD;
      However, it seems important to individualize these recommendations in order to prescribe the&#xD;
      best possible dose of physical activity for each individual. In this project, the&#xD;
      investigators want to test the physical qualities of employees in order to prescribe the best&#xD;
      possible dose of physical activity with the ultimate goal of improving quality of life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Physical activity (PA) is one of the major determinants of health. Indeed, the practice of a&#xD;
      physical activity, even moderate, plays an important role in the prevention and the&#xD;
      management of the main chronic non-communicable diseases (cardiovascular diseases, certain&#xD;
      cancers, diabetes, obesity, osteoporosis ...) as well as by improving psychological health.&#xD;
      The effects are beneficial regardless of age, gender and state of health. Moreover, in&#xD;
      addition to the well-being of employees, several studies have shown that physical activity&#xD;
      has a positive impact on the economy of companies via the reduction of absenteeism and the&#xD;
      improvement of productivity. Today, the World Health Organization (WHO) prescribes 150 min of&#xD;
      physical activity per week regardless of the person's profile (active employee, employee&#xD;
      working in his office, construction worker, etc.).. In this project,the investigators&#xD;
      therefore want to test the physical qualities of employees in order to prescribe the best&#xD;
      possible dose of physical activity with the ultimate goal of improving quality of life.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>After first session evaluation, employees will be randomly assigned to one of the 2 followings groups: (1) group with traditional exercise (CLA) and group with adapted and personalized exercises (IND). The CLA group will perform exercises following World Health Organization (WHO) prescription while the IND group will perform strength, aerobic or flexibility exercises depending on their needs observed during the first assessment.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The perceived fatigue of employees will be assessed (from baseline to 6 months of exercise intervention for both groups) using the FACIT-F scale Scored between 0 and 52 A score below 34 means that the subject experiences significant fatigue in daily life, potentially impacting his quality of life.</description>
