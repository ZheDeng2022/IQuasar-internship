  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression and anxiety that occur around the time of pregnancy can adversely impact a&#xD;
      person's health and well-being, and their child's health and development. Fewer than 20% of&#xD;
      affected people are adequately treated, often because of under-use of medications.&#xD;
      Measurement based care (MBC) is a model of care where psychiatric symptoms are routinely&#xD;
      tracked and reviewed together by a patient and their doctor to better manage symptoms. It has&#xD;
      not been systematically evaluated for perinatal depression and anxiety. The overall objective&#xD;
      of this study is to test the feasibility of MBC in this population to inform a future large&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial for definitive evaluation. In order to avoid known barriers to&#xD;
      MBC, electronic MBC (eMBC) will be used. With eMBC, patients can enter their symptoms into&#xD;
      their electronic medical records before their appointment so that they can be evaluated by&#xD;
      their doctor during the appointment. In this pilot study, the feasibility of recruitment for&#xD;
      a future efficacy trial, including feasibility of recruitment, and retention, acceptability&#xD;
      and adherence to a trial protocol will be evaluated.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A parallel group randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted. Eligible and consenting&#xD;
      patients with depression and/or anxiety will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either the eMBC&#xD;
      condition or a control condition. The study will be stratified by diagnosis (major depressive&#xD;
      disorder vs generalized anxiety disorder).&#xD;
&#xD;
      80 patient participants will be recruited from the Reproductive Life Stages (RLS) Program at&#xD;
      Women's College Hospital. The active treatment phase of the study is 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes will be measured online and by phone at 4-, 8-, and 12- weeks post-randomization.&#xD;
      Following the completion of the study, some participants will be asked to participate in&#xD;
      follow-up interviews. RLS psychiatrists whose patients participated in the study will&#xD;
      participate in a focus group.&#xD;

These will be combined to provide an overall measure of how closely the intervention protocol was followed.</description>

    <time_frame>4, 8, and 12 weeks post randomization</time_frame>
    <description>The Montgomery-Asberg Depressive Rating Scale (MADRS) is a standard clinician-administered measure of depressive symptoms with good reliability and validity in clinical populations. The MADRS has good responsiveness to the effect of anti-depressant treatments. The 17-items are rated on a 7-point (0-6) (score range 0-60), with lower scores indicating fewer symptoms of depression and higher scores indicating a higher degree of symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Clinical outcomes - self-report depression symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>each clinical appointment up to 12 weeks post randomization</time_frame>
    <description>Depressive symptoms will be measured using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depressive Scale (EPDS), a self-report scale that has been validated for use in pregnancy and postpartum. EPDS scores range from 0 to 30. EPDS scores &gt;12 are predictive of a diagnosis of depression, with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Clinical outcomes - anxiety symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>4, 8, and 12 weeks post randomization</time_frame>
    <description>The Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) is a clinician-rated measure that assesses the severity of symptoms of anxiety. The HAM-A has good reliability and validity in populations with depression and anxiety. The 14-items are rated on a 5-point scale (0-4) with scores ranging from 0-56. Scores &lt;17 indicate mild severity, 18-24 mild to moderate severity and 25-30 moderate to severe symptoms.</description>

    <description>The Frequency, Intensity, and Burden Side Effects Rating (FIBSER) Scale is a brief 3-item scale used to measure three domains of anti-depressant side effects including frequency, intensity, and burden of antidepressant medication. The last question relating to burden is scored 0-6 with low scores indicating no medication adjustment is needed, and high scores indicating that the dose needs to be decreased or the medication changed.</description>

    <description>The treating psychiatrist sets a flag in the patient's electronic chart that prompts them to complete self-report scales prior to each appointment:&#xD;
Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) for symptoms of depression and anxiety&#xD;
PROMIS Neuro-QOL and PROMIS ASCQ-Me Social Functioning Short form for measures of functional capacity&#xD;
Adapted Frequency, Intensity, and Burden Side Effects Rating (FIBSER) Scale for participants taking antidepressant medication to measure side effects&#xD;
Patient participants and providers can view the questionnaire results over time in the electronic chart item by item, and/or see them in graphical format. During the clinical encounter, the provider and patient participant review the results of the scales, as part of a collaborative re-evaluation of the treatment plan.</description>
