  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to early 20th century psychoanalysis, the &quot;unsaid&quot; becomes apparent in the&#xD;
      relationship between patient and therapist, as well as in metaphors and symbols revealed&#xD;
      through unintended utterances, imaginative techniques, and dreams. To convey emotions and&#xD;
      thoughts, this method relies on the use of spoken language. Likewise, spoken language remains&#xD;
      central to the practice of psychotherapy in subsequent decades, as clinicians and researchers&#xD;
      sought to translate and transform major claims of psychoanalysis into newer paradigms, the&#xD;
      most prominent of them being cognitive-behavioral, client-centered and family-systems&#xD;
      psychotherapy. Inspired by somatic psychology and neuroscience evidence, more recent&#xD;
      approaches focus on body and movement to target the &quot;unsaid&quot; beyond spoken language. Funded&#xD;
      by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research, the &quot;Sentire&quot; project attempts to&#xD;
      provide immediate sound feedback for physical distance and touch between individuals&#xD;
      (www.sentire.me). The present phase-IIA waiting-list controlled proof-of-concept trial aims&#xD;
      to explore the adequacy of &quot;Sentire&quot; as a potential means to complement existing methods in&#xD;
      couple therapy. The results obtained will determine the design of a subsequent phase-IIB&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
