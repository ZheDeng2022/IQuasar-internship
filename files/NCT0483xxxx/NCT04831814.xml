  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Optical diagnosis of colorectal polyps is a promising tool to avoid risks of unnecessary&#xD;
      polypectomies and to save costs of tissue pathology. NICE (NBI International Colorectal&#xD;
      Endoscopic) and WASP (Workgroup on Serrated Polyps and Polyposis) classification were&#xD;
      developed for diagnosis of adenomatous and sessile serrated polyps, respectively.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Near-focus (NF) narrow-band imaging (NBI) is an image-magnifying technology which enables&#xD;
      optical magnification of up to 65x in near focus (NF) compared with 52x in normal standard&#xD;
      focus (SF) with the simple push of a button of the endoscope to be interchangeable between NF&#xD;
      and SF. There were few studies comparing diagnostic accuracy between NF and SF in the&#xD;
      diagnosis of colorectal polyps. So, our aim of the current study is to compare accuracy of NF&#xD;
      NBI compared with SF NBI in the optical diagnosis of neoplastic and non-neoplastic polyp and&#xD;
      the accuracy of NF NBI versus SF NBI in distinguishing serrated adenoma from hyperplastic&#xD;
      polyp in sessile lesions using histologic evaluation as the gold standard.&#xD;
