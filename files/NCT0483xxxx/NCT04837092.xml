      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK)&#xD;
      of FR104 as well as its potential clinical effect on acute rejection prophylaxis and renal&#xD;
      function in a de novo renal transplant population receiving an allograft from standard&#xD;
      criteria donors.&#xD;
