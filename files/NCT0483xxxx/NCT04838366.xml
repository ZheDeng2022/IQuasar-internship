  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Femur fracture is very common in older people. It makes the people bedridden for long time at&#xD;
      hospital. The fracture of femur is generally managed by the surgical procedure. Prolonged&#xD;
      fasting for surgery makes the patients harassed physically as well as mentally. The long&#xD;
      fasting state emphasizes the body more in catabolic state which increases the insulin&#xD;
      resistivity. Pre-operative carbohydrate loading before two hours the surgery has been&#xD;
      launched in practice to overcome these problems in the world context, however it is not in&#xD;
      existence in Nepal. The aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of pre-operative&#xD;
      carbohydrate loading in the case of femur fracture surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study utilize a hospital based randomized control trial study design to assess the&#xD;
      effect of carbohydrate loading before two hours the surgery over the completely fasting&#xD;
      state. A representative sample size of 66 patients (control group =33 and study group =33)&#xD;
      aged 50 years and above having femur fracture planned for surgery will be selected for&#xD;
      research. The pre-operative nutritional status will be identified and the post-operative&#xD;
      outcomes will be measured by Visual Analogue Score (VAS) and Cumulative Ambulatory Score&#xD;
      (CAS). Statistical analysis will be performed using chi square test, independent sample&#xD;
      t-test or Mann-Whitney U test to compare between the outcome of study groups and control&#xD;
      groups. The outcome of the study may provide a platform to the anaesthesiologists and&#xD;
      surgeons towards the emerging concept of pre-operative carbohydrate loading practice in&#xD;
      Orthopedics surgery in Nepal.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Femur fracture is one of the most common cause for hospital stay in the case of elder people.&#xD;
      Besides these, the patients have the stress of surgery. According to existing practice, the&#xD;
      patients are kept in fasting state from the midnight that makes the patients physically as&#xD;
      well as mentally discomfort. The patients go in the catabolic state. In addition to these,&#xD;
      the prevalence of malnutrition in older people having hip fracture ranges from 2% to 63%. Now&#xD;
      the new concept has been launched that the patients should be fed 50 gram carbohydrate two&#xD;
      hours prior to the surgery, called carbohydrate loading. The study reveals that preoperative&#xD;
      carbohydrate loading decreases the insulin resistance and improves metabolic functions. It&#xD;
      presents the patients in anabolic state rather than catabolic state, resulting in the less&#xD;
      post-operative protein and nitrogen loss, which facilitates the wound healing. It improves&#xD;
      the recovery rate, and hence decreases the length of post-operative stay at hospital, that&#xD;
      brings the smile in the face of patients and reduces the treatment cost too. Similarly, it is&#xD;
      also associated with significantly better well-being. In Nepal, there is the practice of&#xD;
      giving anesthesia to the patient in complete fasting state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prolonged fasting state adds the harassment in the patients. Now, the practice of&#xD;
      preoperative carbohydrate loading before two hours of surgery is preferred in the world&#xD;
      context to minimize the problem of patients discomfort and to maximize better outcome.&#xD;
      However, this type of trend is not practiced in Nepal. Furthermore, the issue of nutrition is&#xD;
      not prioritized in orthopedics in Nepal. So, this study will also evaluate the nutritional&#xD;
      status of the patients under study to relate with the outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size will be calculated based on the previous similar study with a Mean + SE of&#xD;
      Cumulative Ambulatory score (Study groups Vs Control groups: 12.76 + 0.33 Vs 12.02 + 0.32).&#xD;
      Considering this data with taking α level of significance at 5% and power of 80%, the sample&#xD;
      size will be calculated using test comparing independent two means in Stata/MP version 14.1&#xD;
      (StataCorp LP, College Station, Texas). The calculated sample size is 60. To take into&#xD;
      account with 10% loss through follow-up and drop out, the total sample size will be 66 (33&#xD;
      participants in each group.)&#xD;
