      This study assesses the performance status in stage I-III triple negative breast cancer&#xD;
      patients who are receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Information collected in this study may&#xD;
      help doctors learn if movement and fitness trackers can be used to predict side effects in&#xD;
      cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine if in-office movement trackers or baseline metabolic equivalents (METs)&#xD;
      groups identify those patients who are at highest risk for severe adverse event (SAE)s on&#xD;
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the association between the occurrence of SAEs, unexpected healthcare&#xD;
      encounters, depending on the change in activity level classification between the baseline&#xD;
      METs group and mid-treatment METs group (at month 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Explore association between patient reported outcome (PRO) data and movement tracker&#xD;
      data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients complete movement assessment 5-15 days prior to the initiation of neoadjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy and at day 1 of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Patients' SAE data is collected.&#xD;
      Patients are observed during their neoadjuvant chemotherapy for up to 6 months.&#xD;
