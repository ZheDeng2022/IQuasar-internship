  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic gynecologic surgeries are generally very well tolerated procedures, and patients&#xD;
      are able to go home on the same day, with a prescription for pain control. There is currently&#xD;
      a very wide range of prescription practice within the gynecology community in regards to&#xD;
      opioids following surgery, and patients are going home with anything from zero to 5 or even&#xD;
      20 tabs of narcotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aside from negative side effect of opioids (like nausea/vomiting, dizziness, constipation,&#xD;
      and possibly addiction), unnecessary opioid prescriptions and excess unused narcotics is one&#xD;
      of the major contributors to narcotic abuse in the community, worsening an ongoing nationwide&#xD;
      opioid crisis. Although most patients report low pain level following these kinds of&#xD;
      procedure, there are no current standard prescriptions after gynecologic laparoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an effort to standardize discharge prescriptions following gynecologic laparoscopy, this&#xD;
      study aims to find an optimal regimen for pain control in the post-operative period following&#xD;
      laparoscopic gynecologic surgery. There will be 2 standardized set of discharge prescriptions&#xD;
      to which patient will be randomized; both containing multimodal medications for pain control.&#xD;
      Pain control, and patients satisfaction will be measured in the first post-operative week.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Narcotic prescribing patterns vary greatly among gynecologists performing minimally invasive&#xD;
      gynecologic surgery (MIGS). There is no clear consensus or established guideline regarding&#xD;
      the choice of narcotic or total amount to be prescribed, if any, for MIGS. These represent a&#xD;
      generally well-tolerated group of procedures that are less painful than conventional open&#xD;
      surgery. Unnecessary opioid prescriptions and excess unused narcotics have been identified as&#xD;
      major contributors to narcotic abuse in the community, and efforts geared towards minimizing&#xD;
      unnecessary narcotic prescriptions may help curb the growing opioid crisis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study suggests eliminating opioids from discharge prescriptions following outpatient&#xD;
      MIGS in select patients. Given the general tolerability and low pain associated with MIGS,&#xD;
      the investigators hypothesize that elimination of narcotics from post-operative pain control,&#xD;
      in conjunction with regular use of non-narcotic analgesics, will result in analgesia and&#xD;
      early recovery that is no worse than a standard narcotic-containing discharge prescription.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women undergoing elective outpatient laparoscopic gynecologic surgery at two medical center&#xD;
      associated with the McGill University Health Centre will be recruited and screened for&#xD;
      exclusion criteria. Patients will be randomly allocated to either intervention or control&#xD;
      groups in a one to one fashion. Patients in both intervention and control group will undergo&#xD;
      surgery under a standardized anesthesia protocol. Important surgical steps that can affect&#xD;
      post-operative pain will be standardised and recorded with a surgical checklist to reduce&#xD;
      inter-surgeon variability. Patient allocated to the intervention arm will then be discharged&#xD;
      home with a prescription for regular acetaminophen and naproxen for 48 hours, and then as&#xD;
      needed for one week's duration. Patient in control group will be discharge with a standard&#xD;
      prescription of five tabs of 1 mg hydromorphone, with regular non-opioid analgesic use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patient will be contacted on day one and seven after surgery to evaluate pain scores,&#xD;
      mobility, adequacy of analgesia, adherence to treatment, side-effects, and total opioid&#xD;
      consumption.&#xD;
