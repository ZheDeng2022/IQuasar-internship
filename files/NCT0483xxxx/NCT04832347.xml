  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Objective: Sympathetic activity starts to increase during exercise. At the end of the&#xD;
      exercise, while sympathetic activation decreases, parasympathetic activity increases.&#xD;
      Sympathetic and parasympathetic excursions achieve homeostasis. Most of the parasympathetic&#xD;
      activity effects are vagus code. It is aimed to compare the comparison of exercise and vagus&#xD;
      therapy in these healthy individuals.&#xD;

      Objective: The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of stabilization exercise&#xD;
      and vagus nerve stimulation on healthy individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Method: This randomized controlled trial; It is planned to be carried out on&#xD;
      students and administrative / academic staff at Gümüşhane University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First of all, the application will be explained to the individuals and online consent will be&#xD;
      obtained from the individuals for the application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 will be given stabilization exercises. Vagus therapy will be applied to Group 2.&#xD;
      Group 3 will be followed as a control group and no application will be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluations;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluation of autonomous parameters; It was planned to measure pulse and heart rate&#xD;
           variability.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Chest circumference measurement&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. In addition, it is planned to use &quot;Perceived Stress Scale&quot;, &quot;Pitsburg Sleep Quality&#xD;
           Scale&quot; and &quot;Fatigue Severity Scale&quot; questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All individuals were planned to be evaluated before, after and 1 month after the application.&#xD;

    <description>The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) is the most widely used psychological instrument for measuring the perception of stress. Items were designed to tap how unpredictable, uncontrollable, and overloaded respondents find their lives. The scale also includes a number of direct queries about current levels of experienced stress.PSS scores are obtained by reversing responses (e.g., 0 = 4, 1 = 3, 2 = 2, 3 = 1 &amp; 4 = 0) to the four positively stated items (items 4, 5, 7, &amp; 8) and then summing across all scale items. A short 4 item scale can be made from questions 2, 4, 5 and 10 of the PSS 10 item scale.</description>

    <time_frame>Change of the scores obtained in the questionnaires at 2 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The PSQI was developed by Buysse et al43 in 1989 and is a 24-question instrument. The PSQI provides a quantitative measurement of sleep quality that is used to describe good and bad sleep. The PSQI has 7 subscales: (1) subjective sleep quality (component 1); (2) sleep latency (component 2); (3) sleep duration (component 3); (4) habitual sleep activity (component 4); (5) sleep disturbances (component 5); (6) use of sleep medication (component 6); (7) daytime dysfunction (component 7). A high total score from the instrument reflects poor quality of sleep. The instrument does not indicate whether or not there is a sleep disturbance or how widespread the sleep disturbances are, if present. However, a total PSQI score of ≥ 5 has been determined to be poor sleep quality.</description>

    <description>The FSS, which was published in 1989 by Krupp, has nine items. For each question, the patient is asked to choose a number from 1 to 7 that indicates how much the patient agrees with each statement, where 1 indicates strong disagreement and 7 indicates strong agreement. A score of 4 or higher generally indicates severe fatigue.</description>
