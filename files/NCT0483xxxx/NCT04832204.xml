  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Apatinib and SHR-1210 are new drugs produced by jiangsu hengrui pharmaceutical co., LTD. Both&#xD;
      are listed in China. The investigators want to design a trial to explore the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of Apatinib and SHR-1210 in patients with solid tumors with only liver metastasis (as&#xD;
      second-line treatment). The main purpose is to evaluate the disease progression-free survival&#xD;
      (PFS) of Apatinib and SHR-1210 in patients with solid tumors with only liver metastasis&#xD;
      (progress after first-line treatment). The secondary purpose is to compare the total survival&#xD;
      period (OS); 1-year survival rate, 2-year survival rate; evaluation of drug safety;&#xD;
      exploration of related biomarkers in specific subgroups to predict effectiveness or adverse&#xD;
      reactions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Any solid tumor in the presence of liver metastasis indicates poor prognosis, short overall&#xD;
      survival, immunotherapy combination with anti-tumor angiogenesis agents have some curative&#xD;
      effection according to recent studies. It seems there has been clinical evidence to improve&#xD;
      the immune microenvironment of the tumor, while in the case of only liver metastasis, the&#xD;
      tumor's characteristics may not be consistent with other tumors. This study was to&#xD;
      investigate the efficacy and safety of such patients by combining Apatinib and SHR-1210. This&#xD;
      study will include approximately 20 patients with solid tumors with only liver metastases&#xD;
      (progression after first-line treatment). The investigators will evaluate the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of Apatinib combined with SHR-1210 in these patients. If possible we would check the&#xD;
      patients' ctDNA and some infection factors.&#xD;
