  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gait in children with spastic CP is often characterized by abnormal gait kinematics as knee&#xD;
      flexion and equines foot which associated with such gait deviations, an elevated walking&#xD;
      energy cost is often observed which may contribute to activity limitations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ability to maintain proper joint alignment of the lower extremity, and control the&#xD;
      position of the foot in standing and walking is a critical treatment objective for gait in&#xD;
      children with cerebral palsy. Lower extremity orthoses, such as ankle-foot orthoses (AFOs)&#xD;
      are widely recommended in children with spastic cerebral palsy to prevent the development or&#xD;
      progression of this deformity and to improve the dynamic efficiency of the child's gait. The&#xD;
      use of Kinesio taping in pediatric rehabilitation becomes increasingly popular in recent&#xD;
      years. Recent systematic reviews reported moderate evidence that Kinesiology taping is a&#xD;
      useful adjunct to physiotherapy intervention in higher functioning children with CP.&#xD;
      Combination tapings is a technique first introduced by Kenzo Kase, in which Kinesio taping is&#xD;
      coupled with the rigid athletic tape to maximize the treatment benefits. This approach&#xD;
      remains briefly addressed in the literature with no prior studies has examined the effects of&#xD;
      combination tapings in the CP pediatric population. Hypothesis: there is no difference&#xD;
      between the effect of combining tapings and ankle-foot orthosis on spatiotemporal gait&#xD;
      parameters in spastic cerebral palsied&#xD;

      This study was designed as a randomized controlled trial. The participants and their parents&#xD;
      were given clear, detailed explanation of the proposed procedures before starting the&#xD;
      experiment, and signed a written informed consent statement. Batterjee Medical College&#xD;
      Research and Ethical committee reviewed and approved the study, which were conducted in&#xD;
      compliance with the 1975 Helsinki Declaration. Thirty-six children (22 males and 14 females)&#xD;
      with spastic diplegic cerebral palsy were enrolled in this study. The children were randomly&#xD;
      assigned into two study groups (A &amp; B), and a control group (C). Randomization was done by&#xD;
      asking each child to pick up an index card out of a box that contains 36 cards (12 cards for&#xD;
      each group) to determine which group participants would be in. Measurements were taken in two&#xD;
      occasions, baseline, and four weeks after application of the intervention. Spatiotemporal&#xD;
      Gait parameters were measured as per the published guidelines using the GAITRite system.&#xD;
      Parameters included were cadence, step length; stride length, single support time, double&#xD;
      support time, and velocity were evaluated.&#xD;

Parents were given a detailed demonstration about how to use the AFO probably and watching for areas of skin overpressure. AFO needs to be worn with a smooth, long sock underneath with the child's heel is right down in the AFO with the ankle strap and/or shoe fastened firmly.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Children in this group received the same conventional treatment plus the combination taping technique, which was performed by one qualified physical therapist with over five years of experience. The technique started with the application of two 5-cm wide Kinesio tape &quot;I&quot; straps. The first strap was applied from the lateral condyle of the tibia to the base of the first metatarsal bone with the ankle joint in plantar flexion. The tape was not stretched for 5 cm from the initial site and was then stretched up to 30% for the remaining parts15. The second &quot;I&quot; strap While the therapist holds the ankle in dorsiflexion, he applied the distal end of the tape 10 cm below the ankle joint. With almost 70% tension, the proximal end is applied 10 cm above the ankle joint. While one hand was holding each end of the tape, the child was asked to move the joint into plantar flexion. Finally, both hands moved towards the middle of the joint to apply the remaining tape.</description>
