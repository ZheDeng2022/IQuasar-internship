    <textblock>
      Febrile urinary tract infection (FUTIs) are the most common bacterial infections in children&#xD;
      under the age of 2 years. They represent 7% of children presenting with fever without a&#xD;
      source. In case of recurrent or undertreated FUTIs there is a risk for kidney function with&#xD;
      the threat of chronic renal failure [7]. They are more often isolated but some FUTIs may&#xD;
      reveal an underlying and facilitating condition. Beside the well-known congenital anomalies&#xD;
      of the kidneys and urinary tract such as reflux or obstructions, others risk factors for FUTI&#xD;
      are reported. Age less than 1 year, uncircumcised males, poor fluid intake, bladder bowel&#xD;
      dysfunction (BBD) including dysfunctional voiding pattern and constipation increase the risk&#xD;
      of FUTI. The prevalence of BBD in children with FUTIs is far higher than in the general&#xD;
      population. Recommendations emphasize on an efficient treatment of BBD in the first-line&#xD;
      management of recurring FUTIs and it has been proven to be efficient (ref).&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the BBD may include Hirschsprung's Disease (HD). HD is the first congenital&#xD;
      malformation of the enteric nervous system with a reported prevalence of 1 in 5000 live&#xD;
      birth. It's characterized by an aganglionosis and subsequent dysmotility affect by always the&#xD;
      anal canal, most commonly there is a rectosigmoid form (74-80%), and less commonly involves a&#xD;
      long segment of colon (12-22%) or a total colonic aganglionosis with ileal involvement upto&#xD;
      50 cm proximal to ileocecal junction (4-13%). The treatment is based on the resection of&#xD;
      dysfunctional segment of colon with an anastomosis between the normally innervated bowel to&#xD;
      the anus, while preserving normal sphincter function. But significant bowel dysfunction may&#xD;
      persist postoperatively. 20% of the children present a fecal incontinence, and 14% a&#xD;
      constipation in long-term studies. Bladder dysfunction and associated urological anomalies&#xD;
      are also reported in these patients. All of that may facilitate the occurrence of febrile&#xD;
      urinary tract infections (FUTI) in patients with HD. Unfortunately, few studies focused on&#xD;
      this specific population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study was to find out whether children with HD are more prone to&#xD;
      develop FUTIs than controls and which patient with HD are more at risk to develop UTIs.&#xD;

        Cases were patients who underwent surgical treatment of an HD confirmed on histopathologic&#xD;
        exam. Controls were children who underwent an appendicetomy for acute appendicitis without&#xD;
        history of HD, ano rectal malformation or any other colic disease.. Two controls were&#xD;
        matched for age and sex, at least included for each case&#xD;
