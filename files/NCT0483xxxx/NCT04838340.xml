      Background and Purpose: Hypnobirthing is childbirth education model. This model aims for&#xD;
      women to have a painless, calm and more comfortable birth. In this study is aimed to&#xD;
      determine the effect of Hypnobirthing training on fear of childbirth, birth pain, birth&#xD;
      satisfaction and birth outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods: This randomized controlled experimental study was performed in&#xD;
      Maternity Hospital (Bursa, Turkey) . The minimum required sample size to be included in the&#xD;
      study will calculated with G* power. The simple randomization method was use in the&#xD;
      assignment of healthy and nulliparous pregnant women at 28-32 weeks of gestation to the&#xD;
      groups. The assignment of the participants to the experimental group or control group was&#xD;
      carried out with a computer-aided program. The nulliparous women was divided into two groups&#xD;
      as the control group contained women who received the hospital's usual care, and the&#xD;
      experimental group contained women who received the hypnobirthing training intervention. The&#xD;
      fear of birth was measured with the Wijma Birth Expectancy/Experience Scale A and B (W-DEQ);&#xD;
      labor pain was measured with Visual Analogue Scale (VAS); birth satisfaction was measured&#xD;
      with Short Form of Birth Satisfaction Scale (BSS-R); birth outcomes will measure with&#xD;
      postpartum Information form. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences program (version&#xD;
      25.00) was use in data analysis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fear of childbirth and labor pain are big problem that needs to be resolved as a priority&#xD;
      since this situation continues by starting the vicious cycle of fear-anxiety-pain during&#xD;
      childbirth. The persistence of the cycle increases the fear and pain related to childbirth,&#xD;
      and thus delivery may result in emergency cesarean or elective cesarean. According to the&#xD;
      data of Economic Development and Cooperation (OECD), the cesarean section rate in Turkey is&#xD;
      53.1% and so higher than the recommended rate, even Turkey has the highest rate among the&#xD;
      OECD countries . High cesarean rates are an important problem that negatively affects&#xD;
      maternal and infant health and increase health expenditures and costs. Therefore, the&#xD;
      pregnant women education programs aimed at lowering the rate of cesarean section are still&#xD;
      important in Turkey as in other countries. While the childbirth education programs for&#xD;
      pregnant women are not widely practiced in Turkey, the Turkish Ministry of Health (TMOH)&#xD;
      started to provide childbirth preparation courses to reduce the rate of cesarean section in&#xD;
      recent years. In the circular issued by the TMOH in 2018, it was determined that these&#xD;
      programs should be managed by physicians, obstetrics nurses, and midwives. Nurses are&#xD;
      actively involved in pregnancy training programs where different methods are applied in&#xD;
      Turkey as well as all over the world. The most common training methods applied in other&#xD;
      countries are Lamaze Method, Bradly Method, and Hypnobirthing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypnobirthing is a childbirth preparation method that aims to prepare pregnant women for&#xD;
      delivery mentally and physically and to give birth in a less painful, conscious, and&#xD;
      fear-free way. This method was developed based on the fear-stress-pain cycle. The persistence&#xD;
      of this cycle exacerbates stress and pain, prolongs the birth period, and negatively affects&#xD;
      the success, way, preference, course, and satisfaction of the birth. Thus, the birth does not&#xD;
      proceed properly and results in an emergency or elective cesarean section. Hypnobirthing can&#xD;
      prepare women for childbirth to eliminate all these negativities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypnobirthing training can be considered as a new technique for Turkey and therefore we&#xD;
      conducted this study to determine its effects on the pain, fear, satisfaction related to&#xD;
      childbirth and childbirth outcomes.&#xD;

    <description>Hypnobirthing training of the Hypnobirthing group will carry out with its partner. Hypnobirthig training will be given in small groups of 5 or 6 couples for 4 weeks and 3 hours a week. In addition, the usual care will be provided by healthcare professionals to this group.&#xD;
Breathing, relaxation exercises, birth stories and birth videos will be used to reduce fears of chlildbirt women.&#xD;
Deepening and endorphin massage techniques will be given for labor pain. After the endorphin massage technique will be applied individually by the researcher, it will be applied by the couples and they will ask for repeating all exercises at home.&#xD;
In the last week of the training, there will be a birth rehearsal with Hynobirthing methods with the partners.&#xD;
The second meeting will take place when labor begins and after labor.</description>
