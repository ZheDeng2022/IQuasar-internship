      The study will determine if calcipotriene and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) creams when combined can&#xD;
      treat SCCIS and superficially invasive SCC (but not deeply invasive or high-risk cutaneous&#xD;
      SCC). 30 Patients will be divided into a 7 day treatment group (n=10), a 14 day treatment&#xD;
      group (n=10), and a placebo group (n=10, divided into 7 and 14 days evenly). Following&#xD;
      treatment with the topical chemotherapeutic medication, tumors would be completely excised&#xD;
      according to standard of care, and specimens would be sent to pathology to determine if there&#xD;
      was residual tumor/margin clearance. The potential benefit of this intervention would be the&#xD;
      establishment of a non-invasive treatment that leads to minimal to no scarring or&#xD;
      complications (akin to topical 5-FU alone) but would require a much shorter and more&#xD;
      tolerable treatment duration (1-2 weeks) compared to available alternatives.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the skin is exceedingly common. For the most part, cutaneous&#xD;
      SCC grows slowly and has a very high cure rate with excision for deep tumors or&#xD;
      mechanical/chemical destruction for superficial tumors. While metastases are uncommon in the&#xD;
      short-term, tumors can be very locally destructive; thus, their timely treatment is&#xD;
      indicated. SCC develops through a stepwise progression from precancerous lesions known as&#xD;
      actinic keratosis (AK)(less than full thickness epidermal involvement), then in-situ SCC&#xD;
      (SCCIS) (full thickness epidermal involvement) and finally invasive SCC (full thickness&#xD;
      epidermal involvement plus invasion/downward growth into the dermis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For SCCIS, topical treatment with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) cream (a topical antineoplastic&#xD;
      agent) is an established, off-label treatment offering cure rates that are competitive but&#xD;
      slightly inferior to surgical destruction or excision. The existing regimen requires patients&#xD;
      to apply the medication twice daily for six weeks. The benefits of treatment with topical&#xD;
      5-FU is that the patient can treat a large-diameter lesion with minimal post-treatment&#xD;
      scarring and an excellent cosmetic outcome. Alternatives to topical 5-FU include&#xD;
      electrodessication and curettage (ED&amp;C), an office-based procedure performed under local&#xD;
      anesthetic in 10-15 minutes that includes 3 alternating cycles of curettage and desiccation&#xD;
      with a hyfrecator device; this area is allowed to heal by secondary intention and usually&#xD;
      heals with a broad, circular, hyperpigmented/red scar. The other alternative is wide local&#xD;
      excision (WLE). Both invasive procedures carry some risk of complications, including&#xD;
      infection, bleeding/hematoma formation (only with WLE), and wound dehiscence (only with WLE).&#xD;
      The downside to topical 5-FU treatment is that it causes a temporary cutaneous reaction&#xD;
      characterized by erythema, some burning and tenderness, and even some vesicle formation. This&#xD;
      reaction is expected and reflective of the medication (and ensuing inflammatory reaction)&#xD;
      taking effect, and it is explained to patients prior to starting the medication. This&#xD;
      reaction is tolerable by most patients when used for the 2-3 weeks required to treat AKs, but&#xD;
      it can in some cases become intolerable when patients are required to use the medication for&#xD;
      the full 6 weeks to treat superficial skin cancers. However, the benefit to using the topical&#xD;
      chemotherapeutic agent is that, after healing, the end result is excellent in terms of&#xD;
      cosmesis (no or very little scarring).&#xD;
&#xD;
      While less often used for superficial SCC/SCCIS, topical 5-FU is routinely and ubiquitously&#xD;
      employed in dermatology for treatment of actinic keratosis, which, as previously noted, are&#xD;
      pre-cancerous lesions that ultimately progress to SCCIS. Histologically, AKs appear as&#xD;
      partial thickness cellular atypia of the epidermis. Normally, patients need to treat a given&#xD;
      area twice per day for 2-3 weeks in order to sufficiently treat an area with many AKs. A&#xD;
      study published in 2017 discovered that combining topical calcipotriene 0.005% ointment&#xD;
      (vitamin D analogue) with topical 5-FU 5% cream and using that combination twice per day for&#xD;
      only 4 days was dramatically superior to using topical 5-FU alone (combined with petrolatum&#xD;
      placebo).1 In the case of this study, the calcipotriene served to induce a molecule called&#xD;
      &quot;thymic stromal lymphopoietin&quot; (TSLP), an epithelium-derived cytokine that serves as a potent&#xD;
      inducer of antitumor immunity. Effectively, when used together, calcipotriene and 5-FU act&#xD;
      synergistically to induce tumor apoptosis and generate an immune/inflammatory response to&#xD;
      destroy the tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study would take the next logical step and expand/explore this combination of topical&#xD;
      therapies to SCCIS and superficially invasive SCC (but not deeply invasive or high-risk&#xD;
      cutaneous SCC), and do so without putting the patient at any increased risk for tumor&#xD;
      recurrence. The study would be limited to tumors involving the trunk and upper extremities&#xD;
      (excluding the hand). Following treatment with the topical chemotherapeutic medication,&#xD;
      tumors would be completely excised according to standard of care, and specimens would be sent&#xD;
      to pathology to determine if there was residual tumor/margin clearance. The potential benefit&#xD;
      of this intervention would be the establishment of a non-invasive treatment that leads to&#xD;
      minimal to no scarring or complications (akin to topical 5-FU alone) but would require a much&#xD;
      shorter and more tolerable treatment duration (1-2 weeks) compared to available alternatives.&#xD;
