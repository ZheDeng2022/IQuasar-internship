  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A tape is applied over the lumbar 4th and lumbar 5th levels crosswise in people with low back&#xD;
      pain. The possible variation of the arterial flow of the femoral artery is measured with&#xD;
      ultrasound. A kinesiology tape was used as placebo tape and Magnetic Tape was used as&#xD;
      experimental randomly.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A triple-blind cross-sectional observational study is designed where subjects with low back&#xD;
      pain will be selected and blinded to recieve the Magnetic Tape® (tape with magnetic effects&#xD;
      of less than 2 Gauss) or placebo Tape. Likewise, the evaluator who puts the Magnetic Tape®&#xD;
      does not know what material he is using, as it is supplied by another researcher. The&#xD;
      sonographer also does not know if the patient has low back pain or not or what tape will be&#xD;
      placed on him.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recommendations of the &quot;Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials&quot; (CONSORT) will be&#xD;
      followed. All participants will receive a participant information sheet and sign informed&#xD;
      consent. Patients aged 18 to 65 years with low back pain will be recruited from different&#xD;
      private clinics in the city of Valencia, Spain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that when Magnetic Tape® comes into contact with electromagnetic fields&#xD;
      such as those generated by living beings, due to the movement of electrical charges (ions),&#xD;
      as defined by Ampere's Law, the domains of the tape are oriented or aligned in parallel with&#xD;
      the external magnetic field creating a magnetic flux with a north pole and a south pole. This&#xD;
      generated field in turn produces a magnetic induction proportional to the variation of the&#xD;
      magnetic flux, as defined by the Faraday Law.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This electric potential produces a redistribution of the electric charge (ions) generating a&#xD;
      magnetic field due to the orientation of the tape domains, then exerting a force on the&#xD;
      moving charges within the electrolyte.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physiological, Lorentz's Law, regulating Magnetic Tape® aberrant electromagnetic fields.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol for data collection will be as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After signing the informed consent and data protection, the groups with low back pain will be&#xD;
      formed that will receive the application of both Magnetic Tape® and the intervention of a&#xD;
      placebo tape. To avoid that the order of the intervention influences the results of the&#xD;
      study, the subjects will be randomized into two different groups, Group A and Group B. Group&#xD;
      A will receive Magnetic tape® and Group B will do the opposite.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To standardize the location of the tape application, the patient will be placed in the prone&#xD;
      position and the L4 spinous processes will be identified by marking them with a pen. Once L4&#xD;
      is located at the level of the iliac crests, the therapist will palpate the next spinous&#xD;
      process down to the level of L5, and then it will be marked. The tape will be applied&#xD;
      transversely covering the paravertebral skin at both levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Afte this protocol ultrasound will be applied, evaluating the characteristics of blood flow&#xD;
      by means of ultrasound in the common femoral artery using pulsed power doppler. An Alpinion&#xD;
      ECube 12 ultrsound machine with a L3-12H linear probe with a 64 mm footprint will be used.&#xD;
      The variables of Peak systolic PS velocity in (cm/s), peak diastolic velocity (DF) in (cm/s),&#xD;
      the difference between distolic an systolic (S/D), the pulsatility index (PI), the resistance&#xD;
      index (IR) and the artery diameter in (cm) will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess pressure pain in the spinous processes, a Wagner Force Dial - FDK 20 algometer with&#xD;
      a circular contact surface of 1 cm2 will be used. The sensation of perceived pain will be&#xD;
      performed on the paravertebral skin of each level using the pinch technique and assessing it&#xD;
      with the VAS scale. Both the algometer and pinch measurements will be repeated twice at each&#xD;
      level leaving at least 1 minute between measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the pain measurement phase, each participant will be in the prone position where&#xD;
      assessments will be made from L1 to S4. Afterwards, they will be placed in a supine position&#xD;
      and for three minutes to adjust to the room environment and relax, the ultrasound&#xD;
      measurements were taken. Subsequently, a tape will be placed and the perceived pain, pressure&#xD;
      pain and vascular parameters will be measured again.&#xD;
