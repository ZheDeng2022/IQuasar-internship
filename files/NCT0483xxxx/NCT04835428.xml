  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, single-blinded, randomized controlled clinical trial evaluating the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of the AGN1 LOEP SV Kit for the treatment of painful vertebral&#xD;
      compression fragility fractures (VCFs). The objective of this study is to demonstrate&#xD;
      non-inferiority of the AGN1 LOEP SV Kit for the treatment of VCFs to standard of care&#xD;
      vertebroplasty treatment using bipedicular injection of PMMA bone cement.&#xD;
