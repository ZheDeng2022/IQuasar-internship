  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Systane Hydration PF is a recently released preservative-free artificial tear that is able to&#xD;
      supplement the ocular surface's moisture while simultaneously soothing the eye. While Systane&#xD;
      Hydration PF should in theory improve the symptoms and subsequently the quality of life of&#xD;
      patients who have DES, this clinical application has yet to be tested. This drop furthermore&#xD;
      is available in both unit-dose and multi-dose options; however, it is unclear if patient&#xD;
      perceive a difference between the two dispensing methods. Therefore, the primary purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to recruit patients who have DES and to treat them with Systane Hydration PF&#xD;
      and determine how regular use of this drop impacts a patient's ocular surface symptoms and&#xD;
      overall quality of life. This study will secondarily compare the two dispensing methods to&#xD;
      determine if patients prefer one method over the other.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Extensive computer use is no longer an employment-specific challenge. Use of digital devices&#xD;
      in work, home, and leisure settings is now the norm, and it is now socially expected. While&#xD;
      the introduction of high-powered computers and digital devices have greatly improved many&#xD;
      aspects of modern life, the pervasive use of digital devices has caused some patients to&#xD;
      develop a condition known as Digital Eye Strain (DES). DES has been reported to be as high as&#xD;
      93% the population depending upon how the condition is defined, and its severity has been&#xD;
      found to increase with increased digital device time. DES is a condition where patients&#xD;
      experience symptoms such as glare, accommodative dysfunction, defocus, fatigue, discomfort,&#xD;
      and dryness from digital device use, and these dry eye symptoms may also result in decreased&#xD;
      quality of life. While dryness symptoms in DES are likely multifactorial (e.g., contact lens&#xD;
      use, systemic disease status), much of the dryness symptoms in DES are probably due to tear&#xD;
      film evaporation secondary to having a reduced number of blinks per minute while using&#xD;
      digital devices. Since much of the ocular symptoms associated with DES stem from excessive&#xD;
      tear evaporation, artificial tears have become an accepted DES treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systane Hydration PF is a recently released preservative-free artificial tear that is able to&#xD;
      supplement the ocular surface's moisture while simultaneously soothing the eye. Systane&#xD;
      Hydration PF has HydroBoost technology, which is thought to enhance the drop's effectiveness&#xD;
      by incorporating ingredients that increase drop retention. While Systane Hydration PF should&#xD;
      in theory improve the symptoms and subsequently the quality of life of patients who have DES,&#xD;
      this clinical application has yet to be tested. This drop furthermore is available in both&#xD;
      unit-dose and multi-dose options; however, it is unclear if patient perceive a difference&#xD;
      between the two dispensing methods. Therefore, the primary purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      recruit patients who have DES and to treat them with Systane Hydration PF and determine how&#xD;
      regular use of this drop impacts a patient's ocular surface symptoms and overall quality of&#xD;
      life. This study will secondarily compare the two dispensing methods to determine if patients&#xD;
      prefer one method over the other.&#xD;
