  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study has two components. The first component (Aim 1) is a randomized trial of a novel&#xD;
      equine therapy intervention that was developed for research purposes. The second component&#xD;
      (Aim 2) is an evaluation of outcomes from Veterans participating in an adaptive horsemanship&#xD;
      program that is not conducted for research purposes.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Difference in Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-II (AAQII) among the Equine Therapy + TAU cohort compared to the TAU only cohort and for Horsemanship Skills Training Program</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>AAQII measures psychological flexibility. The total AAQII score can range from 7 to 49, with higher values indicating greater psychological inflexibility. Mixed Effect Modeling will be used for the analyses. Within and between group analyses of pre- to post-intervention psychological instrument and service utilization data will be conducted to determine whether outcomes are associated with program participation. We'll estimate the outcome at multiple time points: pre-intervention, post-intervention for selected or all sessions, and post-intervention.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Heart Rate (HR) Indices</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>To determine correlations between physiological responses of the rider and horse, the following heart rate (HR) indices will be computed: Mean HR, standard deviation of the beat-to-beat intervals (SDRR) and the root mean square of successive beat-to-beat differences (rMSSD). Both SDRR and rMSSD are measures of HR variability and reflect shifts between sympathetic (e.g., decrease in HR variability) or parasympathetic (e.g., increase in HR variability) drive. These measures will be taken during each equine intervention session.</description>

Similarly, the score range from 15 to 75 for the negative affect (NA) scale, with higher values indicating greater NA. Mixed Effect Modeling will be used for the primary analyses. Within and between group analyses of pre- to post-intervention psychological instrument and service utilization data will be conducted to determine whether outcomes are associated with program participation. We'll estimate the primary outcome at multiple time points: pre-intervention, post-intervention sessions, and post-intervention.</description>

We'll estimate the outcome after the intervention sessions and post-intervention.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Difference in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (PCL) for Equine Therapy + TAU cohort compared to the TAU only cohort</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>PCL measures PTSD symptoms. The total PCL score can range from 17 to 85, with higher values indicating greater PTSD symptoms. Mixed Effect Modeling will be used for the primary analyses. Within and between group analyses of pre- to post-intervention psychological instrument and service utilization data will be conducted to determine whether outcomes are associated with program participation. We'll estimate outcome post-intervention sessions and post-intervention.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Difference in Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) for Equine Therapy + TAU cohort compared to the TAU only cohort</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>BDI measures depressive symptoms. The total BDI score can range from 0 to 63, with higher values indicating greater depressive symptoms. Mixed Effect Modeling will be used for the primary analyses. Within and between group analyses of pre- to post-intervention psychological instrument and service utilization data will be conducted to determine whether outcomes are associated with program participation. We'll estimate outcome post-intervention sessions and post-intervention.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Difference in Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire - Short Form (Q-LES-Q-SF) for Horsemanship Skills Training Program and for Equine Therapy + TAU cohort compared to the TAU only cohort</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Q-LES-Q-SF measures quality of, and satisfaction with, life. The total Q-LES-Q-SF score can range from 14 to 70, with higher values indicating greater satisfaction. Mixed Effect Modeling will be used for the primary analyses. Within and between group analyses of pre- to post-intervention psychological instrument and service utilization data will be conducted to determine whether outcomes are associated with program participation. We'll estimate outcome post-intervention sessions and post-intervention.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean and Standard Deviation of Personal Satisfaction Program Survey for Horsemanship Skills Training Program and for Equine Therapy + TAU cohort compared to the TAU only cohort</measure>

    <description>Personal Satisfaction Program Survey measures satisfaction with the program. The total Personal Satisfaction Program Survey score can range from 0 to 210, with higher values indicating greater program satisfaction. Mixed Effect Modeling will be used for the primary analyses. Within and between group analyses of pre- to post-intervention psychological instrument and service utilization data will be conducted to determine whether outcomes are associated with program participation. We'll estimate outcome post-intervention sessions and post-intervention.</description>
