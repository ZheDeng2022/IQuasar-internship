  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) is a sight-threatening condition. Children with RRD&#xD;
      usually present late with clinical features of longstanding RRD, specifically a serious&#xD;
      condition named: proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR). Therefore, children with RRD often&#xD;
      have poorer outcomes. The objective of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety&#xD;
      of methotrexate in the treatment and prevention of PVR. Methotrexate is a medication that has&#xD;
      been used to treat inflammatory conditions in children and adults for a long time and it has&#xD;
      been recently used to treat PVR in adults.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Ability to get informed consent from a parent or a legal guardian of the child and&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Males or females 18 years old or younger.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject is undergoing vitrectomy for either i. initial retinal detachment with or&#xD;
             without PVR ii. recurrent retinal detachment due to grade A or higher of proliferative&#xD;
             vitreoretinopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Female subjects of childbearing potential must not be pregnant or breast-feeding, must&#xD;
             have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening, and must be willing to undergo&#xD;
             pregnancy tests throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Female subjects of childbearing potential and male subjects able to father children&#xD;
             must (a) abstain from intercourse throughout the course of the study or (b) agree to&#xD;
             practice acceptable methods of contraception throughout the course of the study (i.e.,&#xD;
             intrauterine device, oral contraceptives, barrier method, or other contraception&#xD;
             deemed adequate by the investigator).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Ocular or periocular infection in either eye including (but not limited to):&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. History of herpetic infection in the study eye(s) or adnexa.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Presence of known active or inactive toxoplasmosis or toxoplasmosis scar in&#xD;
                  either eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. History of cytomegalovirus infection or clinical evidence of active&#xD;
                  cytomegalovirus infection at screening and/or Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Pupillary dilation inadequate for quality stereoscopic fundus photography in the study&#xD;
             eye(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Media opacity that would limit clinical visualization in the study eye(s) and, in the&#xD;
             opinion of the investigator, could not be repaired or improved during the RD surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Other planned eye surgery during the course of the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Corneal opacity in the study eye(s) that would preclude reliable assessment of the&#xD;
             posterior segment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Uncontrolled glaucoma in the study eye(s), evidenced by an intraocular pressure (IOP)&#xD;
             &gt; 21 mmHg while on maximum medical therapy, or chronic hypotony (unmeasurable eye&#xD;
             pressure).&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
         12. History of other disease, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or&#xD;
             clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease condition that&#xD;
             contraindicates the use of an investigational drug, might affect the interpretation of&#xD;
             the results of the study, or renders the subject at high risk for treatment&#xD;
             complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Any uncontrolled systemic disease, except stable syndromic conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
         15. Participation in other investigational drug (oral or topical therapy) or device&#xD;
             clinical trials within 30 days prior to Day 1 and/or participation in other&#xD;
             investigational drug (intravitreal injection therapy) within 3 months or 5 half-lives&#xD;
             (whichever is longer) prior to Day 1 or planning to participate in other&#xD;
             investigational drug or device clinical trials during a time which would overlap with&#xD;
             the duration of the study. This includes both ocular and non-ocular clinical trials.&#xD;
             Exposure to investigational biologics should be discussed with the investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
