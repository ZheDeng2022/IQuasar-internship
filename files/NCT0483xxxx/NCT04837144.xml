  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the safety and usability of a motorized mobility assistance&#xD;
      exoskeleton (MAK). The procedure explores the use of the MAK exoskeleton during the static&#xD;
      and dynamic rehabilitation sessions with the intention to evaluate the safety and usability&#xD;
      of the device in the studied population. The protocol has been focused on defining how the&#xD;
      device can be used appropriately in this population in a safe manner by rehabilitation&#xD;
      specialists.The study also aims to assess the safety of clinicians implementing the&#xD;
      intervention, as well as possible benefits derived from the use of the device. As a secondary&#xD;
      outcome, efficacy measurements will be collected.&#xD;
