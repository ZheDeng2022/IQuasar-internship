  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed research aims to assess the multiple forms and paths of stigma and substance use&#xD;
      as they relate to pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) use for HIV prevention. How stigma and an&#xD;
      evolving public health landscape impact PrEP use among Black sexual minorit men who use&#xD;
      substances is unknown. The current application focuses on addressing critical and novel&#xD;
      questions to improving the essential building blocks of biomedical prevention approaches by&#xD;
      providing crucial information for enhancing interventions to lower HIV prevalence among&#xD;
      substance using Black sexual minority men.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HIV incidence among Black men who have sex with men (BMSM) in the southeastern United States&#xD;
      is one of the highest in the world. Our research team has conducted studies with BMSM in&#xD;
      Atlanta that have demonstrated 35% HIV prevalence and over 5% annual HIV incidence. Although&#xD;
      PrEP is highly effective for preventing HIV transmission, it is not reaching BMSM. The&#xD;
      failures in our ability to engage BMSM in PrEP use are highly problematic given the alarming&#xD;
      rates of HIV transmission among this group. Of particular concern is the impact of substance&#xD;
      use as a barrier in PrEP linkage, uptake, adherence, and persistence. Substance use is common&#xD;
      among BMSM in our study, with 43% (n=204/474) reporting recent substance use. Further&#xD;
      complicating PrEP use is the potential impact of COVID-19 on health care access, health care&#xD;
      infrastructure, and sex behavior. The need to better understand PrEP use in the context of&#xD;
      our new health care landscape is critical to making advances in PrEP use. At this point,&#xD;
      assessing how substance use impacts PrEP use is challenging because PrEP implementation is so&#xD;
      low among this group. The current study aims to provide substance using BMSM with&#xD;
      evidence-based PrEP engagement counseling to address barriers to accessing PrEP (not for&#xD;
      intervention testing, but for facilitating PrEP use) and to assess the multiple forms and&#xD;
      paths of stigma and substance use as they relate to PrEP linkage, uptake, adherence, and&#xD;
      persistence. The investigators propose using the HIV Stigma Framework as a conceptual model&#xD;
      for investigating the intersecting pathways of stigma drivers and stigma mechanisms as they&#xD;
      relate to PrEP use among substance using BMSM. Aim 1: Enroll a prospective cohort of N=500&#xD;
      BMSM who test HIV negative and test substance use positive on toxicology testing, and provide&#xD;
      evidence-based PrEP engagement counseling to facilitate access to PrEP care. Aim 2: Conduct&#xD;
      psychosocial and health care access assessments every 2-months for 18-months, and conduct&#xD;
      HIV/STI testing and dried blood spot testing for TFV-DP every 3-months for 18-months. Aim 3:&#xD;
      Using data collected from Aims 1 and 2, model stigma pathways of advancing and reverting&#xD;
      along the PrEP cascade (i.e., linkage, uptake, adherence, persistence), with these pathways&#xD;
      mediated by health care access and moderated by substance use. Achieving the aims will&#xD;
      provide critical insight for translating and adapting interventions to enhance potency and&#xD;
      durability for individuals at exceedingly elevated risk for HIV.&#xD;

    <description>TFV-DP (Tenofovir Diphosphate) biological testing for PrEP pill taking will be assessed. TFV-DP measured at &gt;700 fmol will be interpreted as having taken â‰¥4 doses/week, and TFV-DP measured at &gt;700 fmol over two consecutive time points will be interpreted as persistence to taking PrEP. The lower scale limit is 0 and upper scale limit is approximately around 2500. Higher values indicate greater medication adherence to PrEP pills.</description>

    <description>Questionnaire to assess stigma related psychosocial variables will be used to assess secondary outcomes. This questionnaire is based measures provided in the HIV Stigma Framework for assessing HIV related stigma (i.e., prejudice, stereotypes, discrimination, enacted stigma, anticipated stigma, and internalized stigma). Responses to the scale items range from 1=strongly disagree to 6=strongly agree, with higher scores indicating a higher number of experiences of stigma.</description>

    <description>This counseling consists of a single-session (45 minute) delivered by trained peer counselors. The primary aims and relevant content areas for counseling are: (1) Assessing and discussing factors known to be drivers of emotional barriers to accessing health care. This counseling aim has two main sub-components: (a) participants will be asked about their prior experiences with accessing health care and their concerns regarding future access, and (b) the counseling will focus on creating personal agency around needing to prioritize one's health. (2) Evaluating concerns around discussing PrEP with health care providers. The counseling combines motivational interviewing with medical decisional balance, which focuses on points to consider when evaluating PrEP. (3) Promoting resiliency beliefs and positive adaptation. For this objective the counselor works with the participant to establish PrEP use goals and problem-solving strategies.</description>
