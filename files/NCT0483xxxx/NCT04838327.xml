      A single-arm prospective observational translational study of biomarkers in patients&#xD;
      receiving targeted treatment for rare subtypes of cancer of the Gastrointestinal Tract.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators seek to investigate biological aspects in patients receiving&#xD;
      targeted treatment for rare subtypes of cancer of the Gastrointestinal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The targeted treatment will be given as per standard of care. Translational blood samples&#xD;
      will be drawn pre-treatment, before the third cycle of chemotherapy, and hereafter&#xD;
      corresponding to the planned imaging during treatment and follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total cell free DNA will be quantified in all samples. The samples will be analyzed for&#xD;
      tumor specific mutations such as the KRAS, BRAF, and NRAS oncogenes, by ddPCR. Circulating&#xD;
      tumor DNA will also be identified by hypermethylation markers, and a focused panel of next&#xD;
      generation sequencing can be applied. The samples will also be analyzed for immune-related&#xD;
      biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators expect to include up to 130 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a purely observational translational study. Results will be analysed in relation to&#xD;
      outcome data.&#xD;
