  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and clinical response of&#xD;
      ASP7517, and determine the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) and/or the Maximum Tolerated Dose&#xD;
      (MTD) of ASP7517 when administered as a single agent and in combination with pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will also evaluate other measures of anticancer activity of ASP7517 when&#xD;
      administered as a single agent and in combination with pembrolizumab based on central and&#xD;
      local assessment.&#xD;

      This study consists of arms receiving ASP7517 monotherapy and arms receiving ASP7517 and&#xD;
      pembrolizumab combination therapy in Phase 1 (dose escalation cohort) and Phase 2 (dose&#xD;
      expansion cohort). Phase 2 monotherapy and combination dose expansion cohorts will be opened&#xD;
      after the phase 1 escalation cohort has been completed.&#xD;

    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant temporally associated with the use of study IP and other study treatments, whether or not considered related to the study IP and other study treatments. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of study IP and other study treatments. This includes events related to the comparator and events related to the (study) procedures. AEs will be graded using NCI-CTCAE guidelines, version 5.0.</description>
