    <textblock>
      In colorectal surgery, hand suturing and stapling are routine methods for performing&#xD;
      intestinal anastomoses, and these methods appear to be similar in terms of clinical safety.&#xD;
      Despite several years of experience with surgical procedures as well as improvements to the&#xD;
      medical devices, problems with disturbed anastomotic healing leading to leakage and stenosis&#xD;
      after colorectal surgery remain a significant challenge for surgeons. A frequency of&#xD;
      anastomotic leakage after stapling or suturing has been reported to range from 3% to 20%. In&#xD;
      addition, preoperative radiotherapy has been shown to increase the risk of anastomotic&#xD;
      leakage even further.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The methods that are used today to detect leakages are unfortunately inaccurately and limited&#xD;
      to monitoring symptoms, temperature, CRP-levels, and performing abdominal examinations and&#xD;
      CT-scans. These clinical signs and parameters usually become apparent several days after&#xD;
      onset of the leakage, which leads to a delayed diagnosis. Anastomotic leakage is not only a&#xD;
      significant cause of increased morbidity of complications and mortality in patients, but also&#xD;
      associated with increased risk of local recurrence and poor prognosis. Moreover, when&#xD;
      reoperation is required to fix the leakage, a permanent stoma may be made at the level of the&#xD;
      sigmoid colon and this procedure impacts live quality of patients negatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the above considerations, a novel, adaptive anastomotic method has been developed by&#xD;
      CarpoNovum to achieve a safer anastomosis. The method's working name is C-REX Ring-locking&#xD;
      Procedure. C-REX is referred to our Colorectal anastomotic rings for Re-join the intestinal&#xD;
      ends and validate the anastomosis, with function of Extract samples for analysis and conduct&#xD;
      X-ray through connected catheters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The newly developed adaptive anastomotic medical devices, C-REX LapAid Cath and C-REX&#xD;
      RectoAid Cath are easy to use, with unique possibility to control the anastomosis during and&#xD;
      after surgery. The previous successful pre-market data support a successful CE marking of the&#xD;
      devices, which encourages a post-market clinical follow-up (post CE mark clinical study) in&#xD;
      patients undergoing colonic resection to collect post-market data of C-REX LapAid Cath and&#xD;
      C-REX RectoAid Cath for the purpose of clinical evaluation and risk analysis.&#xD;

      OVERALL DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a post-market multicentre non-randomized controlled study. In each&#xD;
      investigational site, the investigational personnel shall start with colonic resections,&#xD;
      first 10 patients. When surgeons feel confident using the device and ward personal feel&#xD;
      confident treating the patient postoperatively, they will initiate rectal resections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients for C-REX LapAid Cath are those requiring resection of the left colon&#xD;
      (descending colon and sigmoid) or above the upper rectum (&gt; 15 cm above the anal rim) due to&#xD;
      malign or benign disease. Eligible patients for C-REX RectoAid Cath are those requiring&#xD;
      resection of the rectum due to malign or benign disease. The proximal limit is upper rectum&#xD;
      (&lt; 15 cm above the anal rim) and the distal limit is the anal sphincter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be enrolled in the study after they have provided informed consent, having&#xD;
      undergone physical examination and been found to meet inclusion criteria. Bowel cleansing&#xD;
      prior surgery should be performed according to local routines. The intestinal resection and&#xD;
      anastomosis with the investigational devices, i.e. C-REX LapAid Cath or C-REX RectoAid Cath,&#xD;
      shall be performed in line with standard procedure of proctocolectomy during hospitalization.&#xD;
      Surgeons can utilize catheters that allow monitoring of the anastomosis during and after&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The healing period is expected to be approximately 10 ± 2 days. The short-term implant&#xD;
      detaches via necrosis on the inner part of the intestinal surface and is expelled the natural&#xD;
      way. The patient can be discharged before expelling of the short-term implant upon&#xD;
      investigator's discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be followed up according to local procedure subsequently. The LARS score&#xD;
      shall be assessed at 12 months, and healthcare utilization shall be assessed at 12 months&#xD;
      postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUBJECTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to collect post-market data of C-REX LapAid Cath and C-REX RectoAid&#xD;
      Cath for the purpose of clinical evaluation and risk analysis. No control group is included&#xD;
      in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering that similar anastomotic devices have been used in clinic for decades, the study&#xD;
      will include about 200 subjects from at least 3 different sites/hospitals. In which, colonic&#xD;
      resections shall be applied in 100 subjects, and recta resections in another 100 subjects.&#xD;
      The device used is either C-REX LapAid Cath or C-REX RectoAid Cath.&#xD;
&#xD;
      QUALITY CONTROL:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Authorization to apply investigational devices:&#xD;
&#xD;
           According to CarpoNovum's regulation, clinical investigators must be authorized to&#xD;
           perform adaptive anastomosis with C-REX LapAid Cath or C-REX RectoAid Cath by performing&#xD;
           at least one tutor-led surgery on pigs and at least one train-in surgery on patients&#xD;
           with the trainer. When the clinical investigator is authorized to use the&#xD;
           investigational devices, he or she receives a certificate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Investigation site selection:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Investigation sites will be identified to participate in the study based on current&#xD;
           experience, referrals from the principle investigator, and training in the use of the&#xD;
           investigational devices according to the procedure of surgeon accreditation, and in&#xD;
           accordance with ICH GCP guidelines and ISO 14155. It is expected that the surgeons will&#xD;
           adhere to and follow protocol of performing adaptive anastomosis provided in the IFUs,&#xD;
           and relevant study documents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Monitoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
           To ensure that the study is appropriately conducted, there is a need for on-site&#xD;
           monitoring before, during and after the clinical study. Remote monitoring without&#xD;
           visiting the site may be performed as well. The study will be monitored by CarpoNovum or&#xD;
           its authorized representatives in accordance the internal procedures of CarpoNovum. The&#xD;
           frequency of the visit will be determined by the sponsor and scheduled based on&#xD;
           enrolment and the number of active follow-up visits at each site.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The responsible monitor will evaluate and summarize the results of each monitoring visit&#xD;
           in a written report. The reports will be sent to the sponsor and the principal clinical&#xD;
           investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Traceability and device accountability:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigational devices stored in the investigation site in a locked cabin are only&#xD;
      accessible to investigation personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The size of the device used in surgery should be recorded in CRF, the Patient Record Label on&#xD;
      the device should be pasted on CRF as well. If more than one set of investigational devices&#xD;
      are opened during surgery, all Patient Record Labels should be pasted on CRF and reasons for&#xD;
      why the devices have been opened during surgery should be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After surgery, the information of used or opened devices should be noted in Device&#xD;
      Accountability. The used investigational devices or opened but not used devices, together&#xD;
      with expelled short-term implants should be collected and saved in the investigation site.&#xD;
      All components of devices, no matter if they have been used or not, as well as expelled&#xD;
      short-term implants if possible, should be hand over to the sponsor when the study is&#xD;
      finished. No component of investigational devices should be disposed or lost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DOCUMENTATION AND DATA MANAGEMENT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following information should be clearly documented in medical record of subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  That the subject is informed about the study and that the subject has signed the&#xD;
           informed consent forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  That the subject is participating in the study; the identification code for the subject,&#xD;
           the name of the study, and the study number.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Which treatment the study refers to.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Name of clinical investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All AEs and device deficiencies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The personal data obtained in the course of the study, in accordance with the informed&#xD;
      consent, and in particular clinical findings are subjected to confidentiality. All generated&#xD;
      and processed data during the study are protected by subject's identification code. Subjects&#xD;
      will also provide his/her written approval for concerned investigation personnel,&#xD;
      representatives of the sponsor, monitor and the medical inspection authority, Swedish or&#xD;
      foreign, to obtain access to subjects' medical records, to compare them to collected data or&#xD;
      reported information. This approval will be granted with reservations that information&#xD;
      concerning subjects that become available is not pursued further. Subjects must also give&#xD;
      his/her written approval that the study results that concern the subjects can be used in&#xD;
      reporting on the study as a whole, provided that no records are pursued further.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each subject enrolled, regardless of medical device initiation, a CRF must be completed&#xD;
      and signed by corresponding study personnel. This applies to those subjects who fail to&#xD;
      complete the study. If a subject withdraws from the study, the reason must be noted on CRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data and information of subjects derived from the study, for instance medical records,&#xD;
      imagine reports, surgical notes etc. are considered as source data. To ensure that all data&#xD;
      are complete and correct, source data verification (SDV) will be confirmed by the monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comments in CRF should be made with a ballpoint pen with permanent ink in paper based CRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both paper-based CRF and eCRF, if comments are missing in CRF, reasons for this must be&#xD;
      stated. No questions, squares, fields or similar should be left without comments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The responsible clinical investigator is obliged to keep the subject identification lists&#xD;
      with the subject's identification code and identity in a safe place at the investigation&#xD;
      site, accessible only to the investigation personnel. These source data and subject&#xD;
      identification lists will be saved for 10 years after the close of the study at the medical&#xD;
      institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EARLY STUDY TERMINATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      CarpoNovum reserves the right to terminate a non-preforming site. Reasons for considering&#xD;
      early termination or suspension of an individual site may include, but are not limited to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non-compliance with study protocol or failure to comply with government or local&#xD;
           regulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Failure to submit data in a timely manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Failure to comply with or act upon findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Failure to enrol an adequate number of subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other reasons mentioned in the PMCIP, including that other investigation sites have&#xD;
           enrolled a sufficient number of evaluable subjects which meets the statistical&#xD;
           requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
      CarpoNovum reserves the right to discontinue the study at any time due to, but not limited&#xD;
      to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Strategic considerations of CarpoNovum.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Force majeure event which results that the study cannot continue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon early termination of the study, the sponsor will notify each investigator immediately at&#xD;
      the time of such a decision. Formal documentation will be provided to the Swedish Ethical&#xD;
      Review Authority and investigation sites. After such a decision, the investigators must&#xD;
      contact all participating subjects to notify them of this decision and its impact on their&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL CONSIDERATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Basic demographic and other baseline characteristics will be analysed for all patients.&#xD;
      Summary statistics (arithmetic mean and standard deviation / median and interquartile range,&#xD;
      minimum and maximum for quantitative variables, as appropriate) will be presented for the&#xD;
      total study population. Frequency tables for qualitative data will be provided. Any deviation&#xD;
      from specified statistical plan will be in addition to &quot;per protocol&quot; analysis and will be&#xD;
      reported as such.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any deviations from the specified statistical analysis plan will be described in the study&#xD;
      report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis populations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ITT (Intention to treat) analysis set - all included researchers who have undergone surgery&#xD;
      so that they have been exposed to a risk of leakage according to the primary study point,&#xD;
      including those who withdraw or are excluded during the operation or are excluded during&#xD;
      follow-up. The primary analysis is based on this analysis set.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety analysis set - all researchers who have undergone surgery. Safety endpoints are&#xD;
      analyzed with this analysis set.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Per protocol analysis set - all researchers who completed the study without protocol&#xD;
      deviations. As a secondary analysis, the primary analysis is also performed on this analysis&#xD;
      set.&#xD;

    <description>Anastomotic leakage is defined as a defect in the intestinal wall at the site of the anastomosis (including C-REX short-term implants) which leads to a communication between the intra- and extraluminal spaces. The severity of anastomotic leakage should be classified according to the clinically required measures. Grade A anastomosis leakage does not lead to any change in the researcher's handling, while Grade B leakage requires active therapeutic intervention but is manageable without relaparotomy. Grade C anastomotic leakage requires relaparotomy.</description>
