  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clomiphene citrate resistance (CCR) occur in 15-40% in women with PCOS. Several studies have&#xD;
      shown that letrozole is superior to CC regarding side effects, ovulation, and pregnancy&#xD;
      rates. Letrozole or gonadotropins use for ovulation induction in CCR is not well established&#xD;
      which is superior and most safe.&#xD;

      This study included 70 patients enrolled according inclusion and exclusion criteria. The&#xD;
      inclusion criteria were (a) Infertility lasting one year or more in presence of regular&#xD;
      intercourse, (b) Patients' age between 20-35years (c) Normal semen analysis according to WHO&#xD;
      2010 (d) Patent fallopian tubes (e) Normal prolactin and TSH. (e) Anovulatory cycles&#xD;
      confirmed by mid-luteal progesterone ≤ 3 ng/ml and (f) Clomiphene citrate resistance for 3&#xD;
      cycles of 150mg. Exclusion Criteria were (a) Any hormonal disturbances eg.&#xD;
      hyperprolactinemia, (b) Immunological causes of infertility, (c) Coital errors, (d) Metabolic&#xD;
      disorders and (e) Poor patient compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation: The minimum sample size calculated using Epi info program version 7&#xD;
      for unmatched case control study; 80% power and 95% Confidence interval was 22 for each&#xD;
      group. For better accuracy and validity of results the sample size was increased by 10%=3 in&#xD;
      each group. The total number of cases was 50 and 25 for each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and allocation: It was a prospective quesi-randomization. Based on the&#xD;
      attendance order, patients with odd numbers were considered group I (Letrozole group) and&#xD;
      those with even numbers were considered group II (Gonadotropin group). Allocation was equal&#xD;
      1:1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group I (Letrozole Group n=25): These patients were treated with letrozole (Femara®, Novartis&#xD;
      New York, NY, USA) in a dose 2.5 mg (one tablet daily) orally began on the 3rd day to the 7th&#xD;
      day of the cycle. If ovulation is not achieved dose is increased by 2.5 mg in next cycle till&#xD;
      3 cycles. If hyperstimulation occurred, the cycle was cancelled and the patients were&#xD;
      excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group II (Gonadotropin Group n=25) These patients were given urofollitropin (fostimon ®,&#xD;
      IBSA, Lugano, Switzerland) in a dose of 75 IU/mL I.M from day 3rd to day 7th of the cycle&#xD;
      beginning by one ampoule per day and the dose had been modulated according to response. If&#xD;
      hyperstimulation occurred, the cycle was cancelled and the patients were excluded from the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proper history taking including age, gravidity, parity, infertility duration, history of&#xD;
      laparoscopic surgery, previous induction of ovulation in the last 6 months. Examination was&#xD;
      done to assess weight, height (BMI), signs of androgen excess, thyroid gland and breast&#xD;
      examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum FSH, LH, testosterone level, prolactin level and thyroid stimulating hormone on day 3&#xD;
      of spontaneous menstrual cycle were done. Serum Progesterone (P4) was done on day 22&#xD;
      (midluteal) to confirm ovulation if ≥ 10ng/ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Basal transvaginal U/S on day3 of the cycle to detect criteria of PCOS and count number of&#xD;
      antral follicles in both ovaries and to exclude of any basal ovarian cyst. Transvaginal&#xD;
      ultrasound was also used to follow follicular growth and endometrial thickness starting on&#xD;
      day 8 and then every other day till assuming good ovulatory response when one or more&#xD;
      follicles is ≥ 18mm and endometrial thickness ≥ 6mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (choriomon®, IBSA, Lugano, Switzerland) 10.000IU/I.M was&#xD;
      administered when good ovulatory response was assumed. The intercourse was advised on the day&#xD;
      of HCG injection and every other day for 4 days after injection HCG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number and size of Dominant follicles, endometrial thickness were recorded. Clinical&#xD;
      pregnancy was detected by serum pregnancy test and by presence of intrauterine gestational&#xD;
      sac with fetal pulsation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: Primary outcomes was ovulation rate. Secondary outcomes were pregnancy&#xD;
      rate.&#xD;
