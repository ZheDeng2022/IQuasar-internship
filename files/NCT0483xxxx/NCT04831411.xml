      week; Whole Body Vibration Group and Progressive Resistance Exercise Group. The first&#xD;
      evaluation of the participants will be made at the end of the post-operative 4th week. After&#xD;
      2 days and 6 weeks of training a week, final evaluations will be made at the end of the 10th&#xD;
      postoperative week. Evaluations will include measures of impairment in body functions and&#xD;
      structures, activity limitation measures, balance assessment, and quality of life&#xD;
      assessments. Evaluations will be made by a blind researcher. The study will be started with a&#xD;
      total of 28 patients, including 14 participants in both groups. The sample size was&#xD;
      determined by performing a power analysis. The purpose of the study will be explained to the&#xD;
      patients by the researcher and the patients who agree to participate in the planned study&#xD;
      will be included in the study.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Balance</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Kinesthetic Ability Trainer® (KAT Model TS 650) will be used to evaluate balance. Patients will use the lines on the platform to place their feet in the same place for each measurement. Patients will be informed that the cursor on the system interface indicating the location of the pressure centre should be moved as little as possible and kept close to the centre. The rates of pressure centre change will be recorded as a result of the balance score obtained after 30 seconds of measurements on bipedal feet. Measurements will be applied in 3 repetitions and their average will be recorded and recorded in the study.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Quadriceps muscle strength</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A handheld dynamometer (Commander Muscle Tester, JTech, USA) will be used for quadriceps muscle strength measurement. Patients will be seated on the treatment table with their hips and knees in 90 ° flexion with their feet hanging down. In this position, the hands will be on crossed shoulders and the use of bodyweight will be prevented. During the measurements, verbal guidance will be given to the patients in order to achieve maximum effort. Measurements will be made from the distal anterior face of the tibia with 3 consecutive maximum isometric contractions. The average of the measurement values will be recorded as a score.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain assesment</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Pain will be assessed by the Visual Pain Scale (pain perceived during rest, sleep and walking).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score is a patient-reported questionnaire that evaluates pain, stiffness, and physical function in patients with hip and knee OA. The index consists of 24 questions and the scores of the questions range from 0 (none) to 4 (very severe) and the results are evaluated over 100 points (minimum score:0 and the maximum score:100). Higher scores indicate worst knee functions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of life measure</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Short form-36 will be used for quality of life assessment. SF-36 is a patient-reported questionnaire developed and made available to determine health-related quality of life. SF-36 consists of 36 items that measure eight dimensions of physical function, social function, role limitations due to physical problems, role limitations due to emotional problems, mental health, energy/vitality, pain and general health perception. The subscales assess health between 0 and 100, with 0 showing bad health and 100 showing better health. Higher scores indicate better quality of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>40 m fast-paced walk test</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be asked to walk along the 10-meter track as fast as possible, turn around the cone at the finish, and complete the 40-meter total distance. After the patient passed the baseline in the last stage, the time will be stopped and the total time will be recorded. Lower walking distance indicates better walking capacity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sit-to-stand test</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The patient will be seated in the middle of a chair with a height of standard 44 cm, with his back straight, arms crossed in front of his chest, and feet on the ground. The patient will be asked to get up from the chair and sit down as much as the patient could for 30 seconds. The exact number of starts will be made formed from the patient's score. Higher scores indicate better overall strength.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Stair climbing test</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The patient will be asked to climb and descend the 9-step 16-20 centimetre ladder as quickly but safely as possible. The patient will be allowed to use a handrail or a walking aid, and the method used was recorded. The test will start with the start command and the time stopped when the patient returned to the starting place. The patient will be allowed to stop and rest when requested, but the duration will be continued. The total time was recorded as a score. Lower scores indicate better knee functions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Timed up and go test</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Timed up and go test (TUG) is a measurement that evaluates functional mobility, dynamic balance, fall risk and postural stability, which can be applied for different purposes in different age and patient groups. The activities that make up the test evaluate the transition from sitting to standing position, walking, turning, and sitting again, which are necessary for functional mobility and dynamic balance. The TUG test measures the time it takes an individual to get up from a standard chair with armrests and walk a distance of 3 meters, return from a designated or marked place, return to the chair, and sit down again. Lower scores indicate better mobility and balance.</description>
