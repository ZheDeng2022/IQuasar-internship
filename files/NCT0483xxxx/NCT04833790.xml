      Diarrhea is the second leading cause of death for children around the world, although nearly&#xD;
      all of these deaths could be prevented with an inexpensive and simple treatment: oral&#xD;
      rehydration salts (ORS). Many children with diarrhea do not receive ORS when they seek&#xD;
      treatment and this study uses a field experiment to examine why this occurs. We will use&#xD;
      anonymous standardized patients combined with a randomized ORS supply intervention to isolate&#xD;
      the causal effect of several potential reasons for why children do not receive ORS when they&#xD;
      seek care: 1) caretakers prefer ORS alternatives, 2) providers have a financial incentives to&#xD;
      prescribe ORS alternatives, and 3) ORS is often out of stock.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Diarrhea is the second leading cause of death for children around the world. This is true&#xD;
      despite the fact that nearly all such deaths could be prevented with a simple and inexpensive&#xD;
      solution: oral rehydration salts (ORS). Private health care providers, who treat the majority&#xD;
      of childhood illness in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), are particularly unlikely&#xD;
      to dispense ORS to children with diarrhea. Instead, providers often dispense antibiotics&#xD;
      inappropriately. Recognizing this significant challenge, several international organizations&#xD;
      (including USAID) have invested heavily in trying to increase ORS dispensing in the private&#xD;
      sector. In the absence of evidence on why ORS is so inconsistently dispensed by private&#xD;
      providers, however, several interventions to promote private sector ORS dispensing have been&#xD;
      ineffective. Clearly, a critical and urgent next step is to examine the key drivers of&#xD;
      underprescription of ORS and overprescription of antibiotics in the private sector in order&#xD;
      to inform efforts to improve diarrhea care. In this study, we examine several leading&#xD;
      explanations for poor quality of care for child diarrhea in the private sector. First,&#xD;
      patient preferences for ORS alternatives (e.g., an antibiotic) could be driving&#xD;
      underprescription of ORS. We will identify the causal effect of patient preferences (Aim 1)&#xD;
      by having anonymous standardized patients (SPs) pose as caretakers of children with diarrhea&#xD;
      and express different (randomly assigned) preferences for treatment (ask for ORS, ask for&#xD;
      antibiotics, or let provider decide). Second, private providers could be responding to&#xD;
      financial incentives to sell more profitable alternatives to ORS (e.g., an antibiotic). To&#xD;
      estimate the causal effect of financial incentives (Aim 2), we will instruct a subset of SPs&#xD;
      to inform providers that they can get discounted treatments at a relative's drug shop. This&#xD;
      eliminates the provider's financial incentive to recommend a given treatment and allows us to&#xD;
      estimate the effect of such incentives. Finally, private providers might not directly&#xD;
      distribute ORS or could have frequent stock-outs. To estimate the causal effect of stock-outs&#xD;
      (Aim 3), we will randomly assign half of the providers to receive a three-month supply of&#xD;
      ORS. This generates exogenous variation in stock outs and thus enables us to isolate the&#xD;
      causal effect of stock outs on ORS and antibiotic prescribing. Combining, (a) causal&#xD;
      estimates of the impact of each factor on prescribing, and (b) population estimates of the&#xD;
      prevalence of each factor, will allow us to estimate the population level impact of&#xD;
      implementing interventions that address each factor (Aim 4). This study will provide the most&#xD;
      comprehensive evidence to date on why one of the most important health technologies in&#xD;
      history is often not prescribed. The results will inform the design of interventions aimed at&#xD;
      increasing ORS dispensing and reducing antibiotic dispensing. If such interventions are&#xD;
      targeted appropriately, millions of young lives could be saved.&#xD;
