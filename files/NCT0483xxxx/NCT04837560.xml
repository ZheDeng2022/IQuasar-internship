      Device Efficacy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary efficacy assessment will be defined as successful if the edema volume will be&#xD;
      reduced over time after using the SACS 2.0 device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment and edema evaluation will be performed in comparison to a standard compression&#xD;
      bandage. The treatment will be performed for several hours during the subject's daily rest&#xD;
      time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Measurements will be performed daily before treatment initiation and without the device&#xD;
      on the leg (baseline) (T0); and after four hours of device operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The edema volume will be measured by a calf circumference measurement.&#xD;
