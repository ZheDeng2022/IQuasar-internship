  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Large for gestational age infants (LGA) have increased risks of adverse short-term perinatal&#xD;
      outcomes. This study aims to develop a multivariable prediction model for the risk of giving&#xD;
      birth to a LGA baby, by using biochemical, biophysical, anamnestic, and clinical maternal&#xD;
      characteristics available at first trimester.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We decided to conduct this prospective study that include all singleton pregnancies attending&#xD;
      the first trimester aneuploidy screening at the Obstetric Unit of the University Hospital of&#xD;
      Modena, in Northern Italy.&#xD;

      For each subject, blood sample is collected in fasting conditions, then centrifuged, and the&#xD;
      serum stored at minus 80° C, for subsequent biochemical analyses. PAPP-A, PlGF and Inibin A&#xD;
      is measured with the automated DELFIA EXPRESS system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Perkin Elmer&#xD;
      ®). Insulin, high density lipoproteins (HDL) and triglycerides are measured through routine&#xD;
      laboratory methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mean arterial pressure (MAP) is measured with validated automated devices (Dinamap,&#xD;
      BLTV6XX). After the women are seated and allowed to rest for 3-5 min, normal (22 to 32 cm)&#xD;
      adult cuffs are fitted to their both arms. This is repeated two times with 1 min break in&#xD;
      between. The MAP is calculated with the formula MAP DBP + 1/3(SBP - DBP) 21, where DBP&#xD;
      represents diastolic blood pressure and SBP, systolic blood pressure. We calculate the final&#xD;
      MAP as the average of all four measurements. Uterine artery Doppler studies including&#xD;
      pulsatility index are measured through trans-abdominal ultrasound (Voluson E8 or Voluson E10)&#xD;
      examinations. As indicated in Fetal Medicine Foundation (FMF), when carrying out Doppler&#xD;
      studies, color flow mapping is used to identify each uterine artery along the side of the&#xD;
      cervix and uterus at the level of the cervical internal os. Pulsed wave Doppler imaging is&#xD;
      used with the sampling gate set at 2 mm to cover the whole vessel, and care is taken to&#xD;
      ensure that the angle of insonation is less than 30°. When three to five similar consecutive&#xD;
      waveforms are obtained, PI is measured. The uterine artery mPI is calculated by adding the&#xD;
      right and left pulsatility index together, divided by two. All ultrasound and Doppler studies&#xD;
      are carried out by a physician who had received the appropriate certificate of competence in&#xD;
      the 11-13+6 week scans and Doppler study from the FMF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data on pregnancy outcome are collected from the hospital maternity records or directly from&#xD;
      women if delivered elsewhere.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical records are reviewed by research associates to obtain anonymized data on mothers (i.e&#xD;
      maternal demographics, BMI, age…) and their newborns (birthweight, gender, Apgar score,&#xD;
      admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and length of stay, neonatal&#xD;
      morbidities, and mortality), and are organized in a password protected database.&#xD;
