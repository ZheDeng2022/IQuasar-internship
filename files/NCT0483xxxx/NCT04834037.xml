      Background: Informative and supportive nursing care is essential to reduce complications and&#xD;
      improve outcomes in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) patients treated with&#xD;
      Non-Invasive Ventilation (NIV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: Aim of the study is to determine the effect of provision of information and&#xD;
      supportive nursing care on blood gas, vital signs, anxiety, stress and agitation levels in&#xD;
      COPD patients treated with NIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Methodology: A randomised controlled design was used between September-December&#xD;
      2019. The universe of the study consisted of COPD patients treated with NIV in intensive care&#xD;
      unit in a state hospital. A total of 60 patients, composed of 30 interventions and 30&#xD;
      controls, were randomly included in the sample. Provision of information and supportive&#xD;
      nursing care was applied to the patients in the intervention group. The data were evaluated&#xD;
      with SPSS program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results: Following the intervention, the findings showed that the provision of information&#xD;
      and supportive nursing care has a positive effect on the blood gas, vital signs, anxiety,&#xD;
      stress and agitation levels of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusions: The provision of information and supportive nursing care is recommended to&#xD;
      alleviate anxiety, stress and agitation in COPD patients treated with NIV&#xD;

      Trial design and the participants A randomised controlled design was used between&#xD;
      September-December 2019. This study has been approved (B.30.2.ODM.0.20.08/390) by an ethics&#xD;
      committee. In order to carry out the study, an application permit (17186359-604.02) was&#xD;
      obtained from the Provincial Health Directorate and the relevant hospital. In addition,&#xD;
      written consent forms were obtained from all the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size was determined using G * Power 3.1 software since there was no pilot data.&#xD;
      According to the power analysis, the number of the participants was calculated as at least 54&#xD;
      when a type 1 error was taken as 0.05, power as 0.95, and the effect size as moderate (0.25)&#xD;
      for two groups design with two repeated measures. In order to prevent possible data loss, the&#xD;
      volume of the sample was increased by 10% and the total number of the participants was&#xD;
      determined as 60. A total of 60 COPD patients treated with NIV in intensive care unit,&#xD;
      composed of 30 interventions and 30 controls, were randomly included in the sample. Provision&#xD;
      of information and supportive nursing care was applied to the patients in the intervention&#xD;
      group while the control group received routine nursing care. The inclusion criteria for&#xD;
      participants were: (a) a diagnosis of COPD (b) treated with NIV (c) be conscious of (d)&#xD;
      agreement to participate in the study and (e) COPD patients starting NIV therapy for the&#xD;
      first time. Patients who were intubated and therefore unable to speak, received sedation and&#xD;
      had a Glaskow Coma Scale score below 14 were excluded. There was no drop-out during the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection tools Personal Information Form: The form, developed by the researchers,&#xD;
      included questions about age, gender, educational level, marital status, smoking, information&#xD;
      on COPD, nausea and vomiting, information on NIV use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21): The scale was first developed by Lovibond and&#xD;
      Lovibond (1995) with 42 items and three sub-dimensions. It was later revised to 21 items in&#xD;
      1997. The scale is 4-point Likert type, consists of 21 items and 3 sub-dimensions&#xD;
      (depression, anxiety, stress). The adaptation of the scale to Turkish and its validity and&#xD;
      reliability studies were conducted. Evaluation is obtained by summing the scores given to the&#xD;
      items it contains for each sub-dimension. Minimum 0 and maximum 21 points can be obtained in&#xD;
      all dimensions. The subscales of the scale are Cronbach's alpha values; depression 0.81,&#xD;
      anxiety 0.80, stress 0.75.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS): RASS scale was developed by a multidisciplinary&#xD;
      team at Virginia Common Wealth University. RASS is a 10-point scale that is evaluated using&#xD;
      verbal stimulation followed by eye contact, which is not available in other scales. It is&#xD;
      proven that RASS has excellent validation compared to a wide range of visual analog scales&#xD;
      and selected sedation measurements for adult medical and surgical intensive care patients.&#xD;
      While zero (0) points on the scale indicate the ideal level, it reflects the increasing&#xD;
      agitation towards the (+4) level and the decreasing sedation level to the (-5) level. Since&#xD;
      patients receiving sedation were not included in this study, only the agitation dimension of&#xD;
      the RASS scale was used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glaskow Coma Scale (GCS): It was developed in Scotland / Glasgow in 1974 to describe the&#xD;
      consciousness level of patients. The scale is widely used to assess patients' level of&#xD;
      consciousness. There are 3 separate sections in the scale: eye opening, verbal and motor&#xD;
      response. GCS is obtained by summing the points the patient gets from each section. This&#xD;
      score ranges from three (3) to fifteen (15). If the GCS total score is 13-15, the patient is&#xD;
      considered awake, between 8-12 as precoma, and below 8 as coma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Patients in the experimental group were provided with information in addition to&#xD;
      routine nursing care and supportive care interventions were made. The information leaflet was&#xD;
      explained to the patients in the experimental group face to face by the researchers and the&#xD;
      information was repeated according to the patient's needs. Supportive nursing care was also&#xD;
      practiced to the patients in the experimental group by the researchers. Routine nursing care&#xD;
      was practiced to the control group in the intensive care clinic where the patients were&#xD;
      located.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a pre-test measure, blood gases were taken from the patients in the experimental and&#xD;
      control groups, their vital signs were measured, their state of consciousness was evaluated,&#xD;
      and DASS-21 (anxiety and stress sub-dimension) and RASS (agitation dimension) were practiced&#xD;
      by face-to-face interviews with the patients. As the last test, the same measurements were&#xD;
      made 5 days after the first measurement and before the patients were transferred to the&#xD;
      normal service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An information pamphlet consisting of textual material about NIV treatment was developed. The&#xD;
      content of the information leaflet consisted of topics that will facilitate patient&#xD;
      compliance to treatment, such as the introduction of equipment used in NIV treatment, the&#xD;
      intended use of NIV and its effects on the patient, what patients generally experience during&#xD;
      treatment, compliance problems in NIV, how the procedure will be performed, each procedure&#xD;
      the nurse will do and for what purpose, the duration of the treatment, what the patient can&#xD;
      and cannot do during the treatment, what kind of process will proceed if everything goes&#xD;
      well. As supportive care, patients were allowed to express their feelings and thoughts about&#xD;
      NIV treatment, an accepting and empathetic approach was shown to the patients, care was taken&#xD;
      to make eye contact while communicating, therapeutic touch technique was used, it was&#xD;
      explained how the patients could reach the nurse when needed, the environment was arranged,&#xD;
      each procedure performed was explained with its objectives, they were placed in a position&#xD;
      where they could see the clock, strategies that will make it easier for the patients to cope&#xD;
      during the treatment were determined and they were encouraged to do so (for example, some&#xD;
      patients wanted to read a book and some patients wanted to sleep), the patients were&#xD;
      encouraged to ask questions comfortably, it was stated that the treatment could be&#xD;
      interrupted for a while when they felt bad due to the mask, and it was ensured that the&#xD;
      patients met with their relatives during the visiting hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis The Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) 20.0 package program was&#xD;
      used in the analysis of the data. Descriptive statistics were used as mean ± standard&#xD;
      deviation for variables with normal distribution, and median (min - max) for variables with&#xD;
      non-normal distribution. Nominal variables were shown as the number of patients (n) and (%).&#xD;
      The compliance of the data to normal distribution was examined with the Shapiro-Wilk test and&#xD;
      the homogeneity of the variances with the Levene test. For the comparison of the experimental&#xD;
      and control groups, Student's T test was used for data with normal distribution, Mann Whitney&#xD;
      U test was used for data with non-normal distribution. Chi-Square and Fisher's Exact tests&#xD;
      were used for group comparisons of nominal variables. &quot;Analysis of Variance in Repeated&#xD;
      Measures&quot; was used to analyze the values of the experimental and control groups before and&#xD;
      after the training in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the provision of information and&#xD;
      supportive nursing care intervention practised to the experimental group. In the analysis of&#xD;
      all tests, p value &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.&#xD;
