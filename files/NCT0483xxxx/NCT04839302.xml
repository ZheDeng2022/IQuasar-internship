  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this work is to determine if fluorescence signal intensity changes&#xD;
      from a vascular perfusion fluorophore (indocyanine green) can be associated with the presence&#xD;
      of necrotizing fasciitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis - Tissue regions affected with necrotizing fasciitis will demonstrate reduced&#xD;
      fluorescence intensity compared to an unaffected region without clinical evidence of&#xD;
      necrotizing fasciitis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Necrotizing fasciitis (NF)-commonly known as 'flesh-eating bacteria'-is an aggressive&#xD;
      soft-tissue infection that has a high mortality rate (30-50%). NF is generally associated&#xD;
      with traumatic inoculation of extremely aggressive bacteria into the soft-tissues surrounding&#xD;
      the fascial layer of connective tissue, just deep to the subcutaneous fat. This tissue layer&#xD;
      provides an ideal environment for bacterial growth and also facilitates rapid advancement of&#xD;
      the bacteria along the fascia. The result is a soft-tissue infection that often spreads&#xD;
      centrally prior to detection and/or adequate management, leading to systemic sepsis,&#xD;
      multi-organ failure, and death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further complicating NF management is that there is no definitive diagnostic test. Patients&#xD;
      with NF present generally with pain, fever, and elevated inflammatory labs (white blood cell&#xD;
      count (WBC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and C-reactive protein (CRP)), other lab&#xD;
      abnormalities (elevated glucose and creatinine; reduced sodium and hemoglobin); however,&#xD;
      these are non-specific findings that are associated with numerous other-nonfatal-conditions.&#xD;
      For this reason, a diagnosis of NF is often missed until the condition has progressed too&#xD;
      far.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical fluorescence is a nascent form of medical imaging that seeks to improve the&#xD;
      recognition of important anatomical structures and disease processes through&#xD;
      machine-assisted, visual identification using fluorescent probes called fluorophores. Several&#xD;
      types of fluorophores exist: targeted fluorophores, enzyme-activated fluorophores, and simple&#xD;
      intravascular fluorophores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intravascular fluorophores, primarily indocyanine green (ICG), have been available for ~100&#xD;
      years. ICG is FDA approved and has an excellent safety record with no demonstrable toxicity.&#xD;
      When injected intravenously and viewed with an appropriate fluorescence imager, ICG&#xD;
      effectively maps out the local vasculature, enabling the viewer to distinguish perfused and&#xD;
      non-perfused tissues. ICG's FDA-approved indications and uses include angiography to&#xD;
      determine cardiac output, hepatic function, liver blood flow, and ophthalmic anatomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon histological examination of tissues affected by NF, there exist four commonly observed&#xD;
      features: 1) the presence of bacteria; 2) robust neutrophil infiltration; 3) tissue necrosis;&#xD;
      4) vascular thrombosis. DH-H Department of Pathology currently reviews tissue biopsies with&#xD;
      respect to these criteria when evaluating tissue for the presence of necrotizing fasciitis&#xD;
      (Soloman et al, Modern Pathology, 2018, pp 546-552). While useful to guide clinical&#xD;
      decision-making, histological review is not considered to be a definitive diagnostic finding,&#xD;
      but these observations do have moderate sensitivity and specificity with culture data, which&#xD;
      is considered to be the ultimate determinant of an NF diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of the profound pro-thrombotic effects of necrotizing fasciitis within the&#xD;
      subcutaneous tissues, we hypothesize that the administration of ICG and subsequent imaging of&#xD;
      a bodily region affected with NF will demonstrate substantially reduced fluorescence compared&#xD;
      to the patient's unaffected tissues. If we can demonstrate that ICG fluorescence voids are&#xD;
      characteristic of NF, this could potentially lead to a more rapid, and potentially more&#xD;
      accurate, diagnosis of NF that would lead to more rapid definitive management&#xD;
      and-likely-improved outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this pilot study is to evaluate whether ICG fluorescence may be used as a&#xD;
      non-invasive method of identifying the presence of NF.&#xD;
