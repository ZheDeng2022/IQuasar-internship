  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 96 children and adolescents age 6-15&#xD;
      newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes to describe the influence of antiviral treatment&#xD;
      (Pleconaril and Ribavirin) on progression of disease and residual insulin secretion.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      If antiviral treatment is efficient in halting the disease progression, it will be to great&#xD;
      benefit for the participating patients. Maintenance or even an increase in beta cell mass due&#xD;
      to regeneration will lead to improved endogenous insulin production and give a milder course&#xD;
      of the disease with improved glycemic control. This will in a substantial way improve the&#xD;
      long-term prognosis with less severe long term vascular complications.Some patients may have&#xD;
      close to complete remission and be able to stop insulin treatment. If antiviral treatment is&#xD;
      effective, it would add proof to the concept that type 1 diabetes in its origin is a viral&#xD;
      disease. This would be an important milestone in medical research and a breakthrough in the&#xD;
      understanding of the etiopathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. It may promote the development&#xD;
      of vaccines to prevent the disease. T1D seems more aggressive in children than in adults, and&#xD;
      the beta cell function decline rapidly compared to adults. As a consequence, the effect of&#xD;
      antiviral treatment will potentially be more significant in children than in adults. Children&#xD;
      have higher HbA1c which increases the risk of complications. Thus, T1D is a more aggressive&#xD;
      disease in children than in adults and hence it's important to do this study in children.&#xD;
      Pharmaceuticals are usually studied in different age intervals, commonly 1-6 years, 6-12&#xD;
      years and 12-15 years. For safety reasons and simplicity, the investigators want to start&#xD;
      with the two older groups. The investigators will treat the participants with two antiviral&#xD;
      medications (Pleconaril and ribavirin) or placebo in a double blind, randomized, placebo&#xD;
      controlled, parallel group study. Pleconaril has previously been given in doses of 5-10mg/kg&#xD;
      x 2-3 in clinical trials in children, thus achieving serum levels high enough for killing the&#xD;
      majority of the viruses. The investigators have, due to the long treatment period, reduced&#xD;
      the doses to 5 mg/kg x 2. Ribavirin will be given in dosages according to Summariy of product&#xD;
      characteristics (SmPC). The investigators have chosen to administer Investigational Medicinal&#xD;
      Product (IMPs) as an oral solution as this will make it easier to give the medication&#xD;
      according to weight.&#xD;
