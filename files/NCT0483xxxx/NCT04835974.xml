    <textblock>
      Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with its accompanying adverse sequelae is one of the most&#xD;
      common causes of morbidity and mortality in the world .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although reperfusion techniques for ST- elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI ) are&#xD;
      constantly improving, no-reflow can still lead to poor prognosis .&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, the exact mechanism of no-reflow remains unclear, but clinical and laboratory&#xD;
      findings suggest that it is related to the embolism of the capillary bed, ischemic injury,&#xD;
      vascular endothelial dysfunction, production of oxygen free radical , and other factors .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The no-reflow phenomenon is one of complications of poor functional and clinical outcomes for&#xD;
      patients with (AMI) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The no-reflow phenomenon is present in 25% to 30% of patients with (AMI) underwent successful&#xD;
      coronary recanalization, as shown by angiography . The myocardial no-reflow phenomenon is&#xD;
      associated with a reducution of antegrade myocardial blood flow inspite of an open&#xD;
      infarct-related artery in patients with (STEMI ) undergoing (PCI). Importantly, no-reflow is&#xD;
      known to be related to unfavorable clinical outcome and prognosis . The cause of this complex&#xD;
      phenomenon is the variable combination of four pathogenetic components: distal&#xD;
      atherothrombotic embolization, ischemic injury, reperfusion injury and susceptibility of&#xD;
      coronary microcirculation to injury . As a consequence, appropriate strategies are expected&#xD;
      to prevent or treat these components are expected to avoid the no-reflow. Coronary&#xD;
      reperfusion therapy is widely performed in patients with (AMI) . However, in spite of patency&#xD;
      of the infarct-related artery , there is no guarantee of salvage of myocardium at risk of&#xD;
      ischemia .The no-reflow phenomenon is found in &gt;30% of patients after thrombolysis or&#xD;
      catheter-based (PCI) for (AMI) . It is important, therefore, to be able to predict which&#xD;
      lesions are high risk for no reflow before beginning PCI .&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are numerous recognized risk factors for the development of coronary artery disease&#xD;
      (CAD), one of the best known is the association between blood lipids and CAD . Several&#xD;
      prospective studies have established that the risk of cardiac morbidity and mortality is&#xD;
      directly related to the concentration of plasma cholesterol. ' The most prevalent view is&#xD;
      that the increased risk of myocardial infarction associated with elevated plasma cholesterol&#xD;
      levels can be adequately explained on the basis of the increase in number and severity of&#xD;
      coronary atherosclerotic vascular lesions . .&#xD;
