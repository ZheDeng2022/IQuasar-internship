  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The global cancer burden is estimated to have risen to 18.1 million new cases and 9.6 million&#xD;
      deaths in 2018. Patients with cancer have deficient cellular immunity and are potentially&#xD;
      susceptible to opportunistic infections including Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii). Few reports&#xD;
      are available about toxoplasmosis in this group of patients. In recent years, it has emerged&#xD;
      as an important life-threatening opportunistic pathogen in immunocompromised patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      T. gondii is a ubiquitous obligate intracellular protozoan parasite that can infect virtually&#xD;
      any nucleated vertebrate cell. T. gondii is one of the most successful parasites worldwide,&#xD;
      with upwards of 30% of the human population infected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While T. gondii infection in immunocompetent individuals is usually asymptomatic, it is more&#xD;
      detrimental in immunocompromised individuals, such as those with HIV, patients receiving&#xD;
      organ transplants or undergoing cancer treatment. A variety of malignancies, including&#xD;
      lymphoma, leukemia, and myeloma, can reactivate toxoplasmosis. Moreover, T. gondii is&#xD;
      incriminated to be responsible for the progression of malignant diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening of toxoplasmosis in cancer patients is mandatory to guard against life-threatening&#xD;
      disseminated disease. Diagnosis rely mainly on serology. A study in 2018 was performed to&#xD;
      assess the prevalence of anti-T. gondii antibody among cancer patients in Cairo-Egypt. Among&#xD;
      180 cancer patients, a total of 110 patients (61.1%) were positive for anti-T. gondii&#xD;
      antibodies. Till now there is no screening program in Egypt for toxoplasmosis in cancer&#xD;
      patients although recently demonstrated to be at high risk for acquiring the infection with&#xD;
      life-threatening sequelae.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the significant improvements in serological methods, there are still unresolvable&#xD;
      limitations such as inability of these methods to confirm the presence of parasite in&#xD;
      immunocompromised patients. To overcome these limitations, different molecular methods&#xD;
      including conventional PCR (cn PCR), nested PCR, real-time PCR (qPCR) and also loop-mediated&#xD;
      isothermal amplification (LAMP) techniques have been developed to detect T. gondii DNA in&#xD;
      biological samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As molecular diagnosis is not depending on the immunological condition of the host, it would&#xD;
      be ideal for cancer patients. The ability of molecular methods to detect low amounts of&#xD;
      parasites in fluids or tissues is a key issue, as Toxoplasma can circulate at low&#xD;
      concentrations, or inconstantly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      T. gondii has been considered a single species in the genus Toxoplasma. Early studies on the&#xD;
      parasite strains from North America and Europe identified limited genetic diversity, which&#xD;
      were classified into three clonal lineages I, II, and III.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genotyping of isolates from all continents revealed a complex population structure. Recent&#xD;
      research supports the notion that T. gondii genotype may be associated with disease severity.&#xD;
      The outcome of toxoplasmosis is related primarily to host and parasite genetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first PCR technique for T. gondii detection was established by Burg and colleagues in&#xD;
      which the 35-repeat B1 gene of T. gondii genome was amplified. Following it, several&#xD;
      multi-copy targeting genes including 18S rRNA-, P30-,529-bp repeat fragment or the AF146527&#xD;
      element have been used for the detection of T. gondii in different biological samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In spite of the growing data concerning T. gondii genotypes and its role in epidemiological&#xD;
      and biological studies,very few studies have been reported in Egypt until now. It is&#xD;
      essential to genetically define and characterize T. gondii strains isolated from cancer&#xD;
      patients to understand the population genetic structure, population biology, and pathogenesis&#xD;
      of this important pathogen in our locality using the highly sensitive molecular techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study in Egypt to reveal the population&#xD;
      structure of T. gondii in patients with cancer.&#xD;
