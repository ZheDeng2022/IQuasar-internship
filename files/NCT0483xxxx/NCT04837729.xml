    <textblock>
      In this randomized controlled study, it was aimed to determine the effect of acupressure on&#xD;
      menopausal symptoms and quality of life and the relationship between menopausal symptoms and&#xD;
      quality of life. Three different hypothesis teams have been established for the study. These;&#xD;
      H0: There is no significant difference between the menopause rating scores of the women in&#xD;
      the study group in which acupressure was applied and the control group without acupressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1: There is a significant difference between the menopause rating scores of the women in the&#xD;
      study group in which acupressure was applied and the control group without acupressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H0: There is no significant difference between the quality of life scores of the women in the&#xD;
      study group in which acupressure was applied and the control group without acupressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1: There is a significant difference between the quality of life scores of the women in the&#xD;

&#xD;

      women in the study group in which acupressure was applied and in the control group without&#xD;
      acupressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1: There is a relationship between menopause rating scores and quality of life scores of&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Parallel to the increase in life expectancy by years, the population of women living in the&#xD;
      post-menopausal period is also increasing. In order to have a healthy menopause, which is an&#xD;
      important part of women's life, it is thought that the acupressure without health risks by&#xD;
      women may be effective in reducing the symptoms of menopause experienced by women and quality&#xD;
      of life. In line with this information, it was aimed to determine the effect of acupressure&#xD;
      on menopausal symptoms and quality of life and the relationship between menopausal symptoms&#xD;
      and quality of life. The study will be carried out with menopausal women between the ages of&#xD;
      40-60 in Mersin province in Turkey. Therefore, in the study, 46 women in the menopausal&#xD;
      period between the ages of 40-60 will be randomly assigned to acupressure and control groups.&#xD;
      The study group (n = 23) will be applied to the determined points in a certain order.&#xD;
      Sequence of application Large intestine 4th point (LI 4), Heart 7th point (HT 7), Triple&#xD;
      warmer point 23 (TE 23), Stomach 36th point (ST 36), Spleen 6th point (SP 6) and Liver The&#xD;
      3rd point is (LV 3). Acupressure application for 20-25 minutes three times a week for four&#xD;
      weeks will be applied individually to the study group. No intervention will be made to the&#xD;
      control group for a period of four weeks. The primary expected outcome of the research is the&#xD;
      effect of acupressure on menopausal symptoms of menopausal women. The second expected result&#xD;
      of the study is to determine the effect of acupressure on quality of life. Results will be&#xD;
      applied three times in total, before the study and control application, two weeks and 4 weeks&#xD;
      later.&#xD;

    <description>It was developed in German by Schneider et al. In 1992 to measure the severity of menopausal symptoms and was adapted to English in 1996. MRT was adapted to Turkish by GÃ¼rkan in our country in 2005. There are &quot;0 = None&quot;, &quot;1 = Mild&quot;, &quot;2 = Moderate&quot;, &quot;3 = Severe&quot; and &quot;4 = Very severe&quot; options for each item in the Likert-type scale consisting of 11 items including menopausal complaints. The total score of the scale is calculated based on the scores given for each item. The lowest score that can be obtained from the scale is 0, the highest score is 44.</description>

    <measure>World Health Organization Quality of Life Instrument, Short Form (WHOQOL-BREF)</measure>
    <time_frame>change from before intervention, 2nd and 4th week of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Life of quality will be evaluated by using the WHOQOL-BREF-TR. This scale consists of 27 questions. There are a total of five areas in the scale: physical, mental, social, environmental and national environmental areas. Each area is evaluated within itself. The domain score is calculated with the score it gets from the questions that determine it. Field scores are evaluated between 4-20. Increasing score indicates goodness. Cronbach's alpha internal consistency coefficients of the scale; 0.83 in the physical area, 0.66 in the spiritual area, 0.53 in the social area, 0.73 in the environmental area and 0.73 in the national environmental area.</description>

    <description>acupressure is a non-pharmacological method originating from traditional Chinese medicine. According to the National Cancer Institute, acupressure is defined as pressure / massage applied to certain parts of the body to control symptoms such as pain or nausea. The main purpose of acupressure is to stimulate the regions associated with the specific organ by applying pressure with energy channels called meridians.</description>
