      The aim of the study is to compare the efficacy and effectiveness of Endoscopic Endonasal DCR&#xD;
      with narrow fenstrum approach and Endoscopic Endonasal DCR with wide fenstrum approach .&#xD;

      The lacrimal sac and the nasolacrimal duct are contiguous structures . The part of the sac&#xD;
      superior to the medial canthal tendon (MCT) is called the fundus, with its vertical length&#xD;
      being 3-5 mm . The body of the sac, inferior to the MCT, is about 10 mm in length. The&#xD;
      lacrimal sac fossa comprises of the anterior frontal process of the maxillary bone and the&#xD;
      posterior lacrimal bone .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lacrimal clearance relies on several factors, such as gravity, capillary attraction forces,&#xD;
      evaporation, absorption by the conjunctival surface and the lacrimal &quot;pump&quot; which relies on&#xD;
      the action of the orbicularis oculi muscle, particularly its deeper part (Horner's muscle).&#xD;
      During the eye closing, the Horner's muscle contracts and the temporal four-fifths part of&#xD;
      the canaliculus is pressed and closed, the nasal one-fifth part is pulled posteriorly and&#xD;
      opens with shortening of the canalicular length. Therefore, the lacrimal fluid is effectively&#xD;
      transported from temporal to nasal sides, finally reaching the lacrimal sac cavity. During&#xD;
      the eye opening, as the Horner's muscle relaxes, the temporal four-fifths part of the&#xD;
      canaliculus is expanded and the nasal one-fifth part is pressed and closed. The upper part of&#xD;
      the lacrimal sac is directly affected by the Horner's muscle movement. During eye closing the&#xD;
      sac expands temporally, during the eye opening the sac shrinks with an additional help of its&#xD;
      elasticity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical evaluation of the lacrimal drainage system was originally outlined by Lester&#xD;
      Jones. Evaluation was in the form of a dye disappearance test followed by a Jones I and Jones&#xD;
      II test. The dye disappearance test (DDT) is useful for assessing the presence or absence of&#xD;
      adequate lacrimal outflow, especially in unilateral cases. Using a drop of sterile 2%&#xD;
      fluorescein solution or a moistened fluorescein strip, the examiner instills fluorescein into&#xD;
      the conjunctival fornices of each eye and then observes the tear film.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endoscopic DCR is a widely accepted treatment option for epiphora and dacryocystitis.&#xD;
      endoscopic DCR has been widely performed as it has several advantages over external DCR&#xD;
      including the absence of face scarring and better visualization via endoscopy. The purpose of&#xD;
      DCR is to create a bypass, a rhinostoma, between the lacrimal sac and the nasal cavity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obstruction site in the lacrimal system is one of the characteristics contributing to a poor&#xD;
      prognosis. False localization of the lacrimal sac and inadequate removal of the medial wall&#xD;
      of the sac are the most common causes of failure . A systematic review showed that there was&#xD;
      a trend towards improved outcomes and reduced granulation without increased complication&#xD;
      rates in groups where nasal mucosal and lacrimal flaps were preserved. A study reviewing 100&#xD;
      failed DCR patients showed that inadequate osteotomy, incomplete sac marsupialization, and&#xD;
      cicatricial closure of the ostium were the most common causes of failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To avoid or prevent obstruction of the neo-ostium, many modified techniques have been&#xD;
      attempted. These include complete separation of the sac from the nasolacrimal duct to divert&#xD;
      lacrimal flow to the neo-ostium, use of steroids or mitomycin-C , silicon tubing and use of&#xD;
      mucosal flaps after wide resection of bone surrounding the sac .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially, endoscopic DCR relied on the creation of a relatively small fenstrum into the&#xD;
      lacrimal sac, with the surgeon opening only the lower half of the sac. Many authors claim&#xD;
      that the axilla of the middle turbinate is a landmark for the roof of the lacrimal sac.&#xD;
      However, Wormald and co-authors, in a study with 47 CT-DCG patients, showed that the major&#xD;
      part of the lacrimal sac (10 mm) is situated above the axilla of the middle turbinate,&#xD;
      extending 1-2 mm below this landmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obtaining a large marsupialized lacrimal sac with wide removal of the covering bone, medial&#xD;
      wall of the sac and use of mucosal flaps yields a good surgical result that is comparable to&#xD;
      the results of conventional endoscopic DCR techniques with two advantages first, primary&#xD;
      surgical failures are amenable to technically simple and highly successful surgical&#xD;
      revisions, second, there is a possibility for obtaining wide fenstrum without silicone tube&#xD;
      stenting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Success after lacrimal surgery is ill defined, and this has led to confusion in the&#xD;
      interpretation of results for various surgical methods. The most practical measure of success&#xD;
      is the control of symptoms, although this can be at odds with anatomic outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjective success in turn can be assessed from the patients' symptoms. Complete relief or&#xD;
      significant improvement of complaints can be considered a subjective success.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anatomical patency can readily be judged in objective tests: functional endoscopic dye test&#xD;
      or inspection of the ostium, irrigation or fluorescein retention test. Functional NLDO was&#xD;
      first described by Demorest and Miller in 1955 to encompass lacrimal drainage dysfunction in&#xD;
      the presence of anatomical patency. In those cases, there is a need to exclude other&#xD;
      conditions causing epiphora, such as hyper-secretion, lacrimal pump failure, discontinuous&#xD;
      drainage apparatus and partial lacrimal duct obstruction. The anatomical success rate i.e.&#xD;
      the patency is reported to be higher than the functional success, which highlights the&#xD;
      importance of measuring the physiological success and there relief of the patient's symptoms.&#xD;
