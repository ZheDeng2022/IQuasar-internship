      A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial comparing a single intra-articular&#xD;
      injection of 2.0 mL AlloGen vs 2.0 mL sterile saline. Patients will be evaluated at baseline,&#xD;
      1 week, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 26 weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial comparing a single&#xD;
      intra-articular 2.0 mL injection of either AlloGen or sterile saline. Patients will be&#xD;
      evaluated at baseline, 1 week, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 26 weeks. The patient will remain&#xD;
      blinded to his or her treatment throughout the study duration. The investigator/assessor will&#xD;
      also remain blinded throughout the treatment period. Only the individual(s) preparing the&#xD;
      injection will not be blinded. Black tape over the injection syringe will mask the study&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 30 adult patients with osteoarthritis of one knee that has failed to adequately respond&#xD;
      to conservative non-pharmacologic therapy and simple analgesics, e.g., acetaminophen, will be&#xD;
      enrolled at up to 5 sites in the US. The first 6 subjects will be staggered to evaluate any&#xD;
      significant toxicity. Any adverse event data collected will be reviewed by the Data Safety&#xD;
      Monitoring Board (DSMB) prior to treating the subsequent subject. Cumulative safety data from&#xD;
      these 6 subjects will be reviewed by the DSMB.&#xD;
