  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to estimate the direct, causal impact of medical debt on health&#xD;
      care utilization, mental health, and wellbeing of patients. The investigators will conduct a&#xD;
      survey to measure the impact of the debt forgiveness on health care use, mental health, and&#xD;
      wellbeing. The survey will be administered to approximately 17,000 subjects of a recent&#xD;
      medical financial intervention. In that prior intervention, a non-profit charity, RIP Medical&#xD;
      Debt, purchased and abolished medical debt for a randomly selected about 6,000 (out of the&#xD;
      17,000) individuals. In this current protocol, the investigators will administer the survey,&#xD;
      and will compare surveyed outcomes of subjects who received and did not receive the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;

      This study will estimate the direct, causal impact of medical debt on health care&#xD;
      utilization, mental health, and wellbeing of patients. To do so, the investigators will&#xD;
      administer a survey to approximately 17,000 subjects of a recent medical financial&#xD;
      intervention. In that intervention, a non-profit charity, RIP Medical Debt, purchased and&#xD;
      abolished medical debt for a randomly selected about 6,000 (out of the 17,000) study&#xD;
      subjects. In this current protocol, the investigators will compare surveyed outcomes of&#xD;
      subjects who received and did not receive the medical debt abolishment intervention. Because&#xD;
      debt abolishment was randomized, comparing surveyed outcomes of treated and control subjects&#xD;
      in the cross-section will allow the study to estimate the causal impact of the medical debt&#xD;
      abolishment. The survey will measure the effects of medical debt on three sets of outcomes:&#xD;
      (i) health care utilization, as measured by medical care visits, prescription drug&#xD;
      utilization and adherence, and unmet need for medical care; (ii) mental health, as measured&#xD;
      by validated screens for depression and anxiety; and (iii) subjective wellbeing, as measured&#xD;
      by self-reported health, forgone consumption, and financial strain. This study would be the&#xD;
      first to provide a direct, causal connection between the rising personal debt associated with&#xD;
      U.S. health care and the health outcomes of its recipients.&#xD;

    <ipd_description>We will make de-identified and restricted data available to the research community through portals such as the publicly accessible Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research (hosted by the University of Michigan). We will preserve the confidentiality of study participants and protect personal health information by stripping the data of personally identifying information and purging it of all personal health information, and any information that is sufficiently fine so that it could identify individuals. We will follow standard protocols, such as converting specific dates to relative dates or date intervals, and aggregating small cells. This will allow us to maximize the data available to researchers while strictly preserving confidentiality and privacy.</ipd_description>
