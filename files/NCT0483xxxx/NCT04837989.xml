  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Young females with type 1 diabetes (T1D) is at high risk of eating disorders (ED), with&#xD;
      prevalence rates of ED more than double those of non-diabetes peers. T1D and ED are both&#xD;
      associated with serious somatic complications, and when occurring together the prognosis is&#xD;
      even worse. Despite the frequency and severity of this comorbidity, there is a lack of&#xD;
      intervention studies and no consensus on how to best prevent and treat this comorbidity. To&#xD;
      remedy this, we have developed a virtual diabetes-adapted version of the ED prevention&#xD;
      program Body Project, i.e. the Diabetes Body Project. This study examines the effectiveness&#xD;
      of the Diabetes Body Project to reduce ED risk factors and symptoms among young females with&#xD;
      T1D.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) T1D is caused by an autoimmune destruction of the insulin-producing&#xD;
      beta cells in the pancreas, leading to complete lack of insulin. Insulin is necessary to&#xD;
      regulate blood glucose levels. T1D is a national and international health challenge and&#xD;
      priority, and Norway has among the highest incidence of T1D in the world. This is a growing&#xD;
      problem (incidence in Norway has increased by 30% in the last 15 years) with profound&#xD;
      long-term complications due to sub optimal metabolic control, including atherosclerosis, with&#xD;
      subsequent cerebrovascular and cardiovascular disease, retinopathy, neuropathy and&#xD;
      nephropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significant rates of psychological problems are associated with T1D. One study investigated&#xD;
      young patients with T1D and found that 11% screened positive for depression, 21% for anxiety,&#xD;
      and 21% for disordered eating. Patients with a positive screen had twice the odds of having&#xD;
      poor metabolic control (high HbA1c) as those without. Other psychological correlates reported&#xD;
      to influence T1D self-care and metabolic control include illness perceptions, attitudes to&#xD;
      insulin, and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eating disorders and Disturbed Eating Behaviors (DEB) ED affect approximately 5% of the&#xD;
      female Norwegian population between the ages of 15-44 years, and onset is most common during&#xD;
      adolescence. ED are characterized by disordered eating such as restricted intake or bingeing&#xD;
      and purging, a morbid preoccupation with food, weight and shape and major disturbances in&#xD;
      cognition with distortion of body image. The main eating disorders as defined in the&#xD;
      Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5 (DSM-5) are Anorexia Nervosa (AN),&#xD;
      Bulimia Nervosa (BN), Binge Eating Disorder (BED), and Otherwise Specified Feeding and Eating&#xD;
      Disorders (OSFED). A large amount of disturbed eating behaviors do not meet full criteria for&#xD;
      the diagnoses described above and is often referred to as sub-clinical eating problems or&#xD;
      disturbed eating behaviors. The term &quot;disturbed eating behavior&quot; (DEB) is used here to refer&#xD;
      to sub-clinical eating problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comorbid T1D and DEB Numerous studies indicate that T1D is a risk factor for the development&#xD;
      of DEB. Possible mediating factors include weight loss accompanying disease onset, weight&#xD;
      gain with the initiation of insulin treatment, dietary restraint as part of diabetes&#xD;
      management, and the deliberate insulin under dosing or omission as an effective weight loss&#xD;
      strategy. However, few longitudinal studies of comorbid T1D and DEB exist, and there is a&#xD;
      lack of knowledge about the specific risk factors for the development of DEB in T1D. One&#xD;
      recent longitudinal study states that DEB was common and persistent in their sample of&#xD;
      adolescent females with T1D. At the 14-year follow-up, a total of 32% met criteria for a&#xD;
      current eating disorder, and DEB was reported in 59% of the participant, confirming the&#xD;
      severity of this comorbidity. The cumulative probability of onset was 60% by the age of 25&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DEB is common and persistent in young women with T1D, with prevalence rates double those of&#xD;
      non-diabetic populations. Our prior study found that the prevalence of DEB was 27% among&#xD;
      young Norwegian girls with T1D, indicating that these comorbidities are common in Norway.&#xD;
      Comorbid T1D and DEB are associated with poor metabolic control and increased rates of&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. For example in Nielsen's study of comorbid T1D and anorexia nervosa,&#xD;
      the mortality rate at 10 years follow-up was 2.5 % for T1D and 6.5% for anorexia nervosa;&#xD;
      though when comorbid it rose to 35%. DEB also poses a risk of serious physical complications,&#xD;
      thereby contributing to much poorer prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The nature of T1D-specific DEB It has been suggested that the nature of DEB in T1D is&#xD;
      specific and qualitatively different from DEB in non-diabetes populations. It is hypothesized&#xD;
      that a diabetes-specific DEB has its origins in the nature and course of T1D and T1D&#xD;
      treatment. T1D constitutes a considerable burden on the young patients and their families.&#xD;
      The continuous self-regulation task of adjusting insulin dose to diet, physical activity and&#xD;
      emotional state to maintain blood glucose levels according to recommendations is accompanied&#xD;
      by the threat of developing serious diabetes late complications. Such factors may contribute&#xD;
      to increased weight- and shape concerns among patients with T1D (particularly females).&#xD;
      Reducing or omitting insulin is an efficient weight loss strategy uniquely available to&#xD;
      individuals with diabetes, but is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. In&#xD;
      addition to insulin restriction, bulimic features such as binge eating and self-induced&#xD;
      vomiting or misuse of laxatives are common symptoms of DEB in T1D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the frequency and severity of comorbid T1D and DEB/ED, there is a lack of studies on&#xD;
      how to prevent this condition. The Body Project is reported to be the most effective ED&#xD;
      prevention program in the general population, but this has not been tested in a T1D&#xD;
      population. The overall aim of this study is therefore to evaluate a diabetes-adapted version&#xD;
      of the ED prevention program the Body Project (i.e. the Diabetes Body Project) among young&#xD;
      females with T1D. Specifically, we hypothesize that the Diabetes Body Project can improve i)&#xD;
      ED risk factors (i.e. thin beauty ideal internalization, body dissatisfaction, and dietary&#xD;
      restraint) and symptoms (ED measure composite score); ii) blood glucose control (i.e.&#xD;
      Hemoglobin A1c and time in range); and iii) diabetes-specific psychological aspects (i.e.&#xD;
      diabetes distress and illness perceptions) relative to an educational condition.&#xD;
