      CABG (coronary artery bypass graft) surgery is among the most common heart surgeries&#xD;
      performed in the heart pump. In CABG surgery, operations performed on the beating heart&#xD;
      without the use of CPB (off-pump) are frequently performed (30-60%) (1). Off-pump coronary&#xD;
      artery bypass surgery is also called beating-heart surgery, and its purpose is to avoid&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary bypass completely without the support of a heart lung machine, thereby&#xD;
      avoiding its adverse effects (3-5). It has been reported that the off-pump CPB surgical&#xD;
      method is associated with a decrease in the incidence of early stage and major complications&#xD;
      compared to the traditional CPB method (2). Exposure to surgical stress leads to autonomic,&#xD;
      visceral, and immunological responses, leading to oxidative stress, neurochemical and&#xD;
      hormonal abnormalities (3).In addition to the non-physiological hemodynamic conditions that&#xD;
      occur during CABG surgery, a significant increase is observed in inflammatory response and&#xD;
      oxidative stress biomarkers due to surgical trauma, cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and organ&#xD;
      reperfusion injury (4).For this reason, it is important to detect the presence and severity&#xD;
      of postoperative adverse outcomes after CABG early. To the best of our knowledge, there has&#xD;
      been no study examining cerebral oxygenation values, oxidative stress levels and&#xD;
      postoperative results in CABG operations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective observational study is planned to include 64 adult patients aged 30-80 years&#xD;
      who will undergo CABG surgery. Patients will be grouped according to the surgical technique&#xD;
      (on-pump and off-pump) determined (indicated) according to the cardiovascular risk status of&#xD;
      the patient by the Cardiovascular Surgery department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients' perioperative cerebral hemoglobin oxygen saturations will be recorded with the&#xD;
      Regional Oximeter (non-invasive cerebral oxygenation measurement device).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients undergoing On-Pump bypass, at the beginning of the CABG surgery (basal), during&#xD;
      the aortic clamp, 15 minutes after the clamp is lifted, the remaining 3 ml of blood will be&#xD;
      centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 minutes and the serum part will be separated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In off-pump bypass surgery patients, 3 ml of blood will be centrifuged at the beginning of&#xD;
      the operation, at the beating phase and 15 minutes after the beating process is completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total antioxidant status, Total oxidant status, Superoxide dismutase, Malondialdehyde will be&#xD;
      measured in the Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay device from blood samples taken from all&#xD;
      patients in the study, and their concentrations will be determined.&#xD;
