      In this open-label Phase 3b, single arm study, persistence of antibodies and long term safety&#xD;
      in up to 375 subjects rolled over from study VLA1553-301 (NCT number: NCT04546724)&#xD;
&#xD;
      These subjects will have annual follow-up visits at Months 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 after&#xD;
      immunization. The primary objective of this study will be to evaluate persistence of&#xD;
      antibodies annually from 1 to 5 years after the single immunization with VLA1553. The&#xD;
      secondary objective is to evaluate long-term safety 6 months to 2 years after the single&#xD;
      immunization with VLA1553.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject participated in the VLA1553-301 clinical study;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has an understanding of the study and its procedures, agrees to its&#xD;
             provisions, and voluntarily gives written informed consent prior to any study-related&#xD;
             procedures;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject had immunogenicity blood samples taken at baseline (Visit 1) and either Day 29&#xD;
             (Visit 3), Day 85 (Visit 4) or Day 180 (Visit 5) in Study VLA1553-301 and was negative&#xD;
             for neutralizing antibodies at baseline&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subject presents with clinical conditions representing a contraindication to blood&#xD;
             draws;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has donated blood or use of blood products prior 30 days of immunogenicity&#xD;
             sampling;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has received an active drug with potential immunosuppressive action or&#xD;
             investigational drug or device within a period of 30 days prior a study visit;&#xD;

             subject's well-being, might interfere with evaluation of study endpoints, or would&#xD;
             limit the subject's ability to complete the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is committed to an institution (by virtue of an order issued either by the&#xD;
             judicial or the administrative authorities);&#xD;
