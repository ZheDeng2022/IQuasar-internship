  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial evaluating the impact of the mobile phone delivered SVS&#xD;
      SET Program on utilization, functional capacity, symptoms and quality of life.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a national randomized controlled study with approximately 10-15 sites enrolling&#xD;
      patients with Rutherford II peripheral artery disease (PAD) in total. Patients will be&#xD;
      randomized between the SVS SET Program and &quot;usual care&quot; for each site. The primary outcome&#xD;
      will be to study the site-specific effect on utilization of exercise therapy. Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes will be the effect on the 6-minute-walk test, passive activity and quality of life.&#xD;
