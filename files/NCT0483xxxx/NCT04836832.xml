  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase Ib/II trial studies the side effects of acalabrutinib and duvelisib and how well&#xD;
      they work in treating patients with indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma that has come back&#xD;
      (relapsed) or does not respond to treatment (refractory). Acalabrutinib inhibits a signaling&#xD;
      molecule called Bruton tyrosine kinase and blocks cancer cell proliferation, growth, and&#xD;
      survival. Duvelisib is designed to block a protein called PI3 kinase in order to stop cancer&#xD;
      growth and cause changes in the immune system that may allow the immune system to better act&#xD;
      against cancer cells. Giving acalabrutinib and duvelisib together may work better to block&#xD;
      cancer growth than therapy of either drug alone.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the safety and tolerability of the combination of acalabrutinib and duvelisib in&#xD;
      patients with relapsed or refractory indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (iNHL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). III. To&#xD;
      estimate the overall response rate (ORR, Lugano 2014, computed tomography [CT] based) of&#xD;
      acalabrutinib in combination with duvelisib at 6 months in follicular lymphoma (FL) and&#xD;
      marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the activity of acalabrutinib and duvelisib as measured by ORR based on&#xD;
      positron emission tomography (PET) scan at 6 months, duration of response (DOR) and 2-year&#xD;
      progression-free survival (PFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To capture patient-reported outcomes (PROs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the correlation of the clinical activity of acalabrutinib in combination with&#xD;
      duvelisib with established biomarkers and identify putative novel markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase Ib, dose-escalation study of duvelisib, followed by a phase II&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive acalabrutinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID), and duvelisib PO BID on days&#xD;
      1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 18 cycles in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning cycle 19, patients receive acalabrutinib PO&#xD;
      BID for up to 60 months in absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, and then every 3&#xD;
      months thereafter.&#xD;
