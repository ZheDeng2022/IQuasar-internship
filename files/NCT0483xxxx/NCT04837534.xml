    <textblock>
      Follow-up of pediatric patients is important for their regular ocular morbidity monitoring,&#xD;
      especially for amblyopia management. An observatory data of 1st week (1st to 7th) of January&#xD;
      2019 revealed that the follow-up compliance was very low (22%) among children aged 0-16 years&#xD;
      in the pediatric department of Bharatpur Eye Hospital. A problem tree analysis showed a lack&#xD;
      of awareness in children and their parents regarding the importance of follow-up and patients&#xD;
      forgetting regarding the follow-up visit, usually when there is the long duration of follow&#xD;
      up are the major contributing factors for poor adherence to follow-up. So, an intervention&#xD;
      study was aimed at finding the effectiveness of counseling and reminders through SMS and&#xD;
      phone calls to improve the follow-ups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All pediatric patients 0-16 years of age with ocular conditions requiring at least 3&#xD;
      follow-ups in the study period (January 2021 to April 2021) will be included. Two hundred and&#xD;
      sixty-four participants will be equally distributed to three groups: routine standard care,&#xD;
      counseling, and reminders with SMS and phone calls. In the routine care group, children will&#xD;
      undergo routine care as per existing practice in the hospital and there will be no additional&#xD;
      intervention. In counseling group, in addition to routine care parents/guardians along with&#xD;
      the child will receive counseling from a trained counselor as per the set counseling protocol&#xD;
      in every follow-up visits and will also be provided with the disease-specific information&#xD;
      leaflets as additional information material before the child is discharged from the&#xD;
      department. In the SMS and phone call reminder group, in addition to routine care,&#xD;
      parents/guardians of children will receive reminders through short messaging text (SMS) 3&#xD;
      days and phone calls one day prior to the scheduled visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compliance to follow up Participants completing all the three follow-up visits as per the&#xD;
      schedule within the window period of +/-2 days will be considered as a complaint to follow&#xD;
      up. However, the follow-ups of all the participants will be recorded although that is beyond&#xD;
      the window period. The primary outcome will be measured by the proportion of children&#xD;
      completing all three scheduled follow-ups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ethical approval has been obtained from the Institutional Review Committee of NHRC (ERB&#xD;
      protocol registration number 761/2020 P). Informed consent will be taken from parent and&#xD;
      child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If interventions improve the follow-up rate and are cost-effective, this can be applied in&#xD;
      all the departments of the hospital.&#xD;

      Need: Childhood visual impairment and blindness remains an important public health issue. It&#xD;
      is estimated that around 14 million children in the world are blind. Nepal Pediatric Ocular&#xD;
      Disease study found that prevalence of blindness and visual impairment in the community was&#xD;
      0.068% (95% CI 0.02%-0.12%) and 0.097% (95% CI 0.04%-0.15%) respectively. Increasing the&#xD;
      global knowledge base for planning for childhood eye care services is a top priority in order&#xD;
      for children with visual impairment to realize their full visual potential. Follow-up of&#xD;
      pediatric patients is important for their regular ocular morbidity monitoring, especially for&#xD;
      amblyopia management. A study done in India revealed distance and cost as major barriers, as&#xD;
      was the inability of the eye care center to communicate the importance of follow-up. Another&#xD;
      study done in Nepal found poor follow-up rates for post-cataract surgery patients which&#xD;
      however improved after implementation of a post-operative follow-up program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bharatpur Eye Hospital observed that there is poor adherence to follow-up visits. An&#xD;
      observatory data of 1st week (1st to 7th) of January 2019 revealed that the follow-up&#xD;
      compliance was very low among children aged 0-16 years in the pediatric department. Among the&#xD;
      children advised for follow up only 22% were found to have come for at least one follow-up&#xD;
      visit. Therefore, there was the need to implement measures to improve the follow-up rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential impact: High-quality pediatric counseling service, follow-up program, tracking&#xD;
      system, and cell phone reminders resulted in the improved follow-up of pediatric patients in&#xD;
      Lumbini Eye Institute, Nepal.6 Many studies have compared different methods of reminder&#xD;
      options like telephone calls, email, SMS in order to improve the compliance to&#xD;
      followup.7,8,9,10. Bharatpur Eye Hospital aims to find the effectiveness of counseling and&#xD;
      reminders through SMS and phone calls on improving the follow-up rates of pediatric patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bharatpur Eye Hospital assumes that with the proposed intervention the follow-up rate would&#xD;
      increase to 50% considering the similar increase in follow-up rate in postoperative cataract&#xD;
      surgery patients done in Lumbini Eye Institute (around 20% increase in follow up)6. In&#xD;
      addition to it, another study done in London showed the use of SMS reminders for&#xD;
      ophthalmology outpatient appointments reduced the non-attendance rates by 6.9%.18Improving&#xD;
      follow-ups of patients is important to meet the treatment goal and provide effective and&#xD;
      complete treatment for particular ocular problems. Adherence to follow-up is even more vital&#xD;
      for children because the visual system is still in the developing phase in young children and&#xD;
      loss of follow-up may lead to loss of vision. So, for quality treatment, patient satisfaction&#xD;
      and improvement of the visual status of children, and revenue generation for the hospital it&#xD;
      should be the priority area for the hospital to find ways for improving the existing low&#xD;
      adherence to follow up in pediatric patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study site: Bharatpur, Chitwan is located in the central part of the country, which is 150 K&#xD;
      M. west from Kathmandu and 130 K. M. east from Lumbini (Bhairahawa) with an area of 2218 sq.&#xD;
      Kilometer. The hospital, named Bharatpur Eye Hospital is located in the delightful city of&#xD;
      Bharatpur, the capital of Chitwan district, by the bank of Narayani River, a place of&#xD;
      pilgrimage of the Hindus. It is a tertiary eye hospital that ranks first among the eye&#xD;
      hospitals in Nepal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: All pediatric patients 0-16 years of age attending the pediatric department&#xD;
      of Bharatpur Eye Hospital from January 2021 to April 2021. In the pediatric department&#xD;
      children aged 0-16 years are being examined as per the hospital policy although younger than&#xD;
      18 years is considered as children as per WHO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility: Enrolment criteria: all pediatric patients 0-16 years age attending Bharatpur&#xD;
      Eye Hospital and advised for at least 3 follow up visits within 4 months period (January 2021&#xD;
      to April 2021)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: A sample size of 264 (88 in each of the three groups) pediatric patients will be&#xD;
      targeted with an adjusted significance level of 0.02, 80% power, and 10% loss to follow up.&#xD;
      The sample size for comparison of two proportions using Bonferroni correction (level of&#xD;
      significance=0.05/k=3 comparisons) was adopted. The proportion of attendance in counseling&#xD;
      (p1) and reminder SMS/phone call(p2) are taken as 50% (0.5) and 25% (0.25) respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size has been calculated as per the general objective that &quot;To determine the&#xD;
      effect of counseling and reminders through SMS and phone calls in improving the follow-up&#xD;
      rates in pediatric patients&quot;. Hence this study is not exclusively looking at the difference&#xD;
      between counseling and reminder through SMS and phone call with routine standard care group&#xD;
      separately. That means the project is looking for overall improvement in follow-up rate based&#xD;
      on the package of the interventions vs routing standard care group. For ease of understanding&#xD;
      2 groups have been created among the intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: None Program: The total costs involved in implementing the interventions will&#xD;
      be compared with the attendance of follow-up patients and the revenue generated through their&#xD;
      follow-ups. The intervention costs include the salary for the team members. In addition to&#xD;
      the costs for the phone calls and reminder SMS telecommunication charges, the cost for&#xD;
      equipment, stationary, and the charges for utility services like water and electricity will&#xD;
      also be included as the cost for implementing interventions. Cost-effectiveness will be&#xD;
      analyzed separately for counseling and reminders (phone &amp;SMS) by calculating the total cost&#xD;
      incurred per attendance of follow-up in each intervention group and the total revenue&#xD;
      generated through the attendance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection: Records of the participants from the first visit to all the follow-up visits&#xD;
      will be maintained in the department by the Assistant of Pediatric Ophthalmologist. In order&#xD;
      to obtain the required data from the participants, a proforma has been designed based on&#xD;
      variables pertaining to sociodemographic and follow-up. Proforma has been developed in the&#xD;
      English language, sequence of questions will be carefully looked into as well as skips&#xD;
      pattern (if any). Questions pertaining to identification and socio-demographic information&#xD;
      appeared first, then follow-up points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The record of the patients will be kept even if they come for follow-up beyond the set window&#xD;
      period (+/- 2 days), however in this case they will not be considered compliant to follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assistant will also assign the group to the patients (if they receive any intervention or&#xD;
      not) as per the study procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management plan: A follow-up recording file (3 in number, one each for routine standard&#xD;
      care, counseling, and reminders through SMS and phone call) will be maintained. These&#xD;
      follow-up details will also be entered in the excel sheet on the same day as a backup in case&#xD;
      the paper records are lost or destroyed. The entry of all the details from the proforma will&#xD;
      be done in the excel sheet by the assistant and the status of record maintenance will be&#xD;
      regularly monitored. The data entry program will be designed in the SPSS version (The latest&#xD;
      version). Mr. Gopal, who is an optometrist and Co-PI in this study, will do the first and&#xD;
      second data entries. Validation of the two data sets will be done. Corrections will be made&#xD;
      where required by comparing the computer data file with the original proforma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The local statistician will also be part of this study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis plan: Data will be processed and analyzed using SPSS latest version&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first step descriptive analysis will be done, summarizing demographic variables by&#xD;
      computing means with standard deviation for continuous variables and percentages for&#xD;
      categorical variables. Amputation and intention to treat analysis will also be conducted (if&#xD;
      required).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Univariate analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Univariate logistic regression analysis will be conducted by comparing two variables for each&#xD;
      variable of interest using odds ratio (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI).&#xD;
      Likelihood ratio test will be used to estimate odds ratio and 95% CI for odds ratio for all&#xD;
      associations of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multivariate analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multivariate logistic regression analysis will be performed to adjust for simultaneous&#xD;
      effects of multiple factors on the outcome variable. The criteria for inclusion of factors in&#xD;
      the multivariate analysis are to include all variables from the univariate analysis with a&#xD;
      p-value of &lt;= 0.1 along with all the variables of known biological importance. To assess the&#xD;
      importance of each variable included in the model, a Wald statistic for each variable will be&#xD;
      used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before conducting multivariate analysis, the association among independent variables will be&#xD;
      checked by the chi-square test. For independent variables having more than two categories,&#xD;
      dummy variables will be created. All the variables meeting the above selection criteria will&#xD;
      be entered one by one, starting with the highly significant factor from the univariate&#xD;
      analysis. The overall significance of independent variables in the model will be assessed by&#xD;
      the likelihood ratio test (G statistic). The selection of the final model will be based on&#xD;
      parsimony, biological interpretability, and statistical significance. The parameters of the&#xD;
      logistic regression model will be estimated by the maximum likelihood method. The adjusted&#xD;
      odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) will be computed using the&#xD;
      estimates of parameters of the final model. The dependent variable will be dichotomous,&#xD;
      either follow-up rate increased or as it is (no difference). The final model will be tested&#xD;
      for goodness-of-fit by Hosmer- Lemeshow chi-square (x2) statistic. P-values will be noted to&#xD;
      assess the model fit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring: Supervision and monitoring will be done by PI and co-PI every week to check the&#xD;
      study participants' enrolment, record keeping, and maintenance of data and ensure research&#xD;
      activities are taking place as per the research protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics and consent: The ethical approval for the study will be obtained from the Review&#xD;
      Committee of NNJS / Nepal Health Research Council. Written consent will be taken from the&#xD;
      children in an assent form (if 9 years or older) and from their parents/guardians in a&#xD;
      consent form before enrolling them in the study. Approval for conducting the study has also&#xD;
      been taken from Bharatpur Eye Hospital.&#xD;
