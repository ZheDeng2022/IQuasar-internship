      The use of polyclonal anti-T cell antibodies (ATG) has benefits in kidney transplantation,&#xD;
      however, its use is associated mainly with hematological, infectious, and neoplastic&#xD;
      complications. Monitoring T cells in patients receiving ATG was first proposed in 1975 to&#xD;
      improve efficacy in preventing acute rejection and avoiding excessive immunosuppression. The&#xD;
      dose regimen is guided by a daily count of TCD3+ lymphocytes. Monitoring the dose of&#xD;
      thymoglobulin through its biological effects on T cells is a rational and safe method of&#xD;
      titrating the dose of that antibody. This way, it is possible to reduce the total amount of&#xD;
      drug administered to the patient and, consequently, reduce undesirable complications, as well&#xD;
      as the cost of treatment, without losing effect on the benefit of immunosuppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the usual cumulative dose of ATG for induction in kidney transplant patients is&#xD;
      6mg/kg, in divided doses. However, the ideal dose and duration of therapy are still the&#xD;
      subject of studies, with protocols between centers varying from total doses of 3 to 6 mg/kg,&#xD;
      either fractionated or single, to achieve the lowest dose with fewer undesirable effects, and&#xD;
      with reduced length of inpatient stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of ATG in a single dose of 3 mg/kg was successfully assessed for risks of infection&#xD;
      and rejection in patients with low immunological risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study proposes evaluating the efficacy and safety of a single 3mg/kg dose of ATG for&#xD;
      patients with low and standard immune risk, with TCD3+ lymphocyte monitoring, to assess the&#xD;
      duration of the TCD3+ cells in the peripheral blood.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Kidney transplantation is one of the major advances in medicine in the past 60 years.&#xD;
      Currently, is considered the best treatment for terminal chronic kidney disease in the medium&#xD;
      and long term, and the least costly. To obtain these successful outcomes, the immune response&#xD;
      to the graft must be properly controlled and monitored since its implantation. T and B&#xD;
      lymphocytes are crucial in the alloimmune response by mediating cellular and&#xD;
      antibody-mediated rejections, respectively, and along with anti-HLA antibodies are the main&#xD;
      effectors of acute and chronic rejections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) has a key role in the immunosuppressive induction regimens used&#xD;
      in kidney transplants as well as in the treatment of acute rejections. It is a purified&#xD;
      solution that contains a variety of T cell-specific immunoglobulins, including CD2, CD3, CD4,&#xD;
      CD8, CD11a, CD18, CD25, HLA-DR, and class I HLA (human leukocyte antigen). This solution is&#xD;
      produced by immunizing rabbits with human thymocytes. The use of these agents is particularly&#xD;
      important in inducing patients who are more predisposed to the nephrotoxic effects of&#xD;
      calcineurin inhibitors (CI), allowing the delayed introduction of the CI. Induction with&#xD;
      antibodies is also of great value in patients with higher immunological risk, such as&#xD;
      pediatric, Afro-descendants, re-transplanted, and previously sensitized to HLA antigens&#xD;
      recipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Polyclonal antibodies have definite benefits in kidney transplantation, but their use is&#xD;
      associated with hematological, infectious, and neoplastic complications. The use of reduced&#xD;
      doses of ATG has been the subject of recent studies, but still with inconclusive results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The concept of monitoring T cells in patients receiving ATG was first proposed in 1975 to&#xD;
      improve efficacy in preventing acute rejection and avoiding excessive immunosuppression. The&#xD;
      dose regimen is guided by a daily count of peripheral blood TCD3+ lymphocytes. Monitoring the&#xD;
      dose of thymoglobulin through its biological effects on T cells is a rational and safe method&#xD;
      of titrating the dose of that antibody. This way, it is possible to reduce the total amount&#xD;
      of drug administered to the patient and, consequently, reduce undesirable complications, as&#xD;
      well as the cost of treatment, hopefully without losing effect on the benefit of&#xD;
      immunosuppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 60% reduction in the total dose of ATG and 58% reduction in therapy cost was observed in&#xD;
      patients who were monitored using TCD3+ cell counts. Currently, the usual total dose of ATG&#xD;
      for induction in kidney transplant patients is 6mg/kg, divided into 4 doses, which can be&#xD;
      administered from day zero until day 14 (maximum) of transplantation. However, the ideal dose&#xD;
      and duration of therapy are still the subject of investigation, with protocols between&#xD;
      centers varying from total doses of 3 to 6 mg/kg, fractionated or single, to attempt to&#xD;
      achieve the lowest dose with fewer undesirable effects, and with reduced length of inpatient&#xD;
      stay. The use of ATG in a single dose of 3 mg/kg was successfully assessed for risks of&#xD;
      infection and rejection in patients with low immunological risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering that the adverse effects associated with the use of ATG are relevant in the&#xD;
      clinical context of kidney transplantation, the use of a lower dose, keeping its&#xD;
      immunomodulatory effect, with a safer profile, is desirable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study evaluates the efficacy and safety of a single dose of 3mg/kg ATG for patients with&#xD;
      low and standard immune risk, with TCD3+ lymphocyte monitoring, to assess the clinical&#xD;
      efficacy and the modulation of the T cell response.&#xD;
