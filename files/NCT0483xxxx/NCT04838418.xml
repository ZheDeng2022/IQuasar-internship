  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In sudden cardiac arrest patients with return of spontaneous circulation, brain damage is one&#xD;
      of the main determinants of short-term mortality and poor prognosis (CPC 3-5). It is&#xD;
      important to properly select group of patients in whom treatment is futile. According to&#xD;
      current guidelines, multimodal approach is recommended. Optic nerve sheath diameter measured&#xD;
      by ultrasound is non-invasive, fast, low-cost and readily available bed-side method, but&#xD;
      evidence for its use as neuroprognostication modality is limited to only few small studies.&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate validity of ONSD as neuroprognostication method at&#xD;
      larger cohort of patients, compare it with other established methods and compare ultrasound&#xD;
      and CT measurement of ONSD.&#xD;
