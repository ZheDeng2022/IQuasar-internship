  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alveolar bone resorption often occurs after tooth extraction. At present, guided bone&#xD;
      regeneration technique is widely used in clinic since it leads to less trauma and less&#xD;
      complications. Tenting screw technology, basic on the classical GBR, implants screws into the&#xD;
      surgical area to prevent the barrier membrane from collapsing. Moreover, advanced platelet&#xD;
      rich fibrin and injectable platelet-rich fibrin are used to provide the osteogenic function.&#xD;
      The investigators intend to increase vertical alveolar bone augmentation by combining tenting&#xD;
      screws and A-PRF, I-PRF.&#xD;
