      The proposed project seeks to develop and test an intervention to improve engagement in HIV&#xD;
      and mental health care for young Black gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men&#xD;
      (YB-GBMSM) in Ryan White clinics.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Young Black gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (YB-GBMSM) are&#xD;
      disproportionately impacted by HIV, with suboptimal rates of engagement across the HIV&#xD;
      Continuum of Care (HIV-CoC). Mental health (MH) comorbidities contribute to poor HIV care&#xD;
      engagement for many YB-GBMSM; however, effective treatment for these conditions is hindered&#xD;
      by barriers including logistical challenges, medical mistrust, and MH stigma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Ryan White Care act supports integration of HIV and MH services; however, preliminary&#xD;
      studies demonstrate low rates of MH referrals and MH care engagement among YB-GBMSM living&#xD;
      with HIV, even in these ostensibly integrated care settings. The objective of this study is&#xD;
      to develop and implement CHIMES (Cross-disciplinary HIV Integrated with Mental Health&#xD;
      Support), a clinic- and provider-level intervention to improve HIV-MH care integration and MH&#xD;
      care engagement among YB-GBMSM attending Ryan White clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale for this study is that efforts to improve integration of services, particularly&#xD;
      if they are culturally tailored, are likely to increase MH and HIV care engagement for&#xD;
      YB-GBMSM. The proposed study will pursue two specific aims: (1) to develop the CHIMES&#xD;
      intervention; and (2) to conduct a hybrid type 2 implementation-effectiveness pilot trial of&#xD;
      CHIMES in two Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA)/Ryan White-funded clinics&#xD;
      in Atlanta, Georgia - a city in the heart of the Southern HIV epidemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the first aim, the researchers will work collaboratively with provider and patient&#xD;
      stakeholders, adapt existing evidence-based interventions, and build on formative data to&#xD;
      refine intervention content, informed by the Capability- Opportunity-Motivation-Behavior&#xD;
      (COM-B) Model. For the second aim, the researchers will implement CHIMES in the two clinic&#xD;
      settings and conduct a mixed-methods assessment in which continuous data collection informed&#xD;
      by the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework will be&#xD;
      used to evaluate effectiveness and implementation processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effectiveness of the CHIMES intervention will be measured by change in HIV and MH care&#xD;
      engagement before, during, and after CHIMES implementation. The researchers will abstract&#xD;
      clinic-level aggregate data to characterize change in HIV-CoC and MH care engagement outcomes&#xD;
      for YB-GBMSM.&#xD;
