  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two arm, pilot randomized control trial (RCT) in which 60 African American women&#xD;
      (AAW), 40-64 years of age, with HbA1c ≥8% and multi-caregiving responsibilities will be&#xD;
      recruited from communities in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and randomized to either: 1) a&#xD;
      group-based, peer support, nurse-facilitated intervention to address multi-caregiving&#xD;
      responsibilities, or 2) a nurse-facilitated diabetes education and skills training and&#xD;
      general health education group. Both groups will be delivered face-to-face by a nurse to 30&#xD;
      AAW each (3 groups of 10) and is comprised of 12 weekly sessions and 3 boosters. Intervention&#xD;
      groups will last 2h each, and usual care groups will last 1h each. All study assessments will&#xD;
      be administered by a Program Coordinator at baseline, 3-, and 6-months of follow-up and&#xD;
      performed in the community at the locations where the groups are held.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to test the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of this&#xD;
      multi-caregiving intervention on improving outcomes among AAW, ages 40-64 years with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes (T2DM) and multi-caregiving responsibilities using a pilot randomized design&#xD;
      compared to diabetes enhanced usual care. The goals of the study will be assessed under the&#xD;
      following specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To determine the feasibility of the multi-caregiving intervention as measured by&#xD;
      recruitment, session attendance, retention, and treatment adherence in AAW with T2DM Aim 2:&#xD;
      To test the preliminary efficacy of the multi-caregiving intervention on glycemic and blood&#xD;
      pressure control in AAW with T2DM compared to group-delivered, nurse led diabetes enhanced&#xD;
      usual care at 6 months Hypothesis 1: AAW who receive the multi-caregiving intervention will&#xD;
      have significant reductions in hemoglobin A1c at 6 months compared to AAW who receive&#xD;
      diabetes enhanced usual care Hypothesis 2: AAW who receive the multi-caregiving intervention&#xD;
      will have significant reductions in blood pressure at 6 months compared to AAW who receive&#xD;
      diabetes enhanced usual care Aim 3: To test the preliminary efficacy of the multi-caregiving&#xD;
      intervention on self-care behaviors and quality of life in AAW with T2DM compared to&#xD;
      group-delivered, nurse led diabetes enhanced usual care at 6 months Hypothesis 1: AAW who&#xD;
      receive the multi-caregiving intervention will have significant improvements in self-care&#xD;
      behaviors (diet, physical activity, medication adherence, and blood glucose monitoring) at 6&#xD;
      months compared to AAW who receive diabetes enhanced usual care Hypothesis 2: AAW who receive&#xD;
      the multi-caregiving intervention will have significant improvements in quality of life&#xD;
      (SF-12 scores) at 6 months compared to AAW who receive diabetes enhanced usual care&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the final 6-month assessment, study participants will be asked to participate in 30 to&#xD;
      40-minute, semi-structured interviews by telephone. Findings will help refine the&#xD;
      intervention and emphasize elements that enhance participant uptake and motivation for&#xD;
      sustained behavior change for the future R01.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Glycemic Control from Baseline to 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening/Baseline, 3-months, 6-months</time_frame>
    <description>A Point-of-Care (POC) device will be used by the nurse/health educator to collect a blood specimen to measure the HbA1c level. All collections will be performed in the community at the public housing development. At the screening visit, the HbA1c must be 8% or greater to be eligible for participation.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Diet from Baseline to 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening/Baseline, 3-months, 6-months</time_frame>
    <description>Diet will be measured by the 26-item Dietary Screener Questionnaire (DSQ) used in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Responses are used to estimate individual dietary intake for fruits, vegetables, dairy, added sugars, whole grains, fiber, adn calcium.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Physical Activity from Baseline to 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening/Baseline, 3-months, 6-months</time_frame>
    <description>Physical activity will be measured using the 7-item International Physical Activity Questionnaire that asks about physical activities over the last 7 days.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Blood Pressure Control from Baseline to 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening/Baseline, 3-months, 6-months</time_frame>
    <description>Blood pressure measurements will be obtained by the nurse/health educator using an automated BP monitor with participants seated comfortably for 5 minutes prior to the measurements.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Blood Glucose Monitoring from Baseline to 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening/Baseline, 3-months, 6-months</time_frame>
    <description>Blood glucose monitoring will be assessed with the previously validated Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities (SDSCA) scale, where scores are calculated for each of the five areas assessed by the SDSCA over the past 7 days: diet, exercise, blood glucose monitoring, foot care, and smoking status. Higher scores mean more engagement in self-care behaviors.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Medication Adherence from Baseline to 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening/Baseline, 3-months, 6-months</time_frame>
    <description>Medication adherence will be measured with the 6-item validated self-report Brooks Medication Adherence Scale. Each question asks yes-no questions about adherence, where a &quot;no&quot; response indicates better adherence.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Health Related Quality of Life from Baseline to 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening/Baseline, 3-months, 6-months</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-12 is a valid and reliable instrument to measure functional status and yields summary physical (PCS-12) and mental health (MCS-12) outcome scores. Summary scores range from 0 to 100 where higher scores mean better quality of life.</description>
