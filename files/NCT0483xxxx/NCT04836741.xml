  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Central South University in collaboration with Tianjin University developed the first&#xD;
      domestically produced Chinese minimally invasive surgical (MIS) robot system which named&#xD;
      &quot;Micro Hand S&quot; in 2013. This new MIS robot had been authorized to enter the clinical trial&#xD;
      stage by the Ethics Committee of the Third Xiangya Hospital at Central South University. The&#xD;
      Micro Hand S robot is safe and feasible in the preliminary study. However, compared with&#xD;
      minimally invasive approaches (da Vici, laparoscope), the merits and demrits of rectectomy&#xD;
      for rectal cancer are unclear. Therefore, the investigators conduct this retrospective study&#xD;
      to focus on this concern.&#xD;
