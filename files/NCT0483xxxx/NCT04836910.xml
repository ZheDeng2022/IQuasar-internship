      Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder among women in&#xD;
      reproductive age with an estimated prevalence of 5% to 19.5%. It is a chronic complex&#xD;
      syndrome with psychological (depression and anxiety), reproductive and metabolic&#xD;
      abnormalities. The etiology seems to be multifactorial. Lately, interest regarding the&#xD;
      association between PCOS women and gut macrobiotic have been emerged. Hyperandrogenism was&#xD;
      correlated with those changes in the microbiota which reflects the fact that the microbiome&#xD;
      can influence the development and pathology of PCOS .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, aim of this study is to explore the diversity and alternations of the vaginal and&#xD;
      the gut microbiome in patients with PCOS during common therapeutic interventions and connect&#xD;
      them to different phenotypes of the syndrome.&#xD;

      Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder among women in&#xD;
      reproductive age with an estimated prevalence of 5% to 19.5%. It is a chronic complex&#xD;
      syndrome with psychological (depression and anxiety), reproductive and metabolic&#xD;
      abnormalities. The etiology seems to be multifactorial. It seems there are both genetic,&#xD;
      epigenetic and environmental contributors (almost 100 susceptible genes were identified).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The quality of life (QQL) of women suffering from PCOS is significantly reduced in all&#xD;
      domains (functional ability, physical and emotional) and major health problems is correlated&#xD;
      to PCOS. Women with PCOS demonstrate hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance. They have an&#xD;
      increased risk for type 2 diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance. Studies have shown that&#xD;
      adipocyte function is considerably aberrant in women with PCOS including: lower lipase&#xD;
      activity, defective glucose transport and dyslipidemia. Obesity is more prevalent in women&#xD;
      with PCOS. They are also exposed to long term risk for additional disorders like&#xD;
      cardiovascular diseases (atherosclerosis) or even cancer (endometrial or ovarian) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      PCOS is the primary cause of anovulatory subfertility. Furthermore, women with PCOS are at&#xD;
      risk for pregnancy and obstetrical complications including preterm birth, pre- eclampsia and&#xD;
      meconium aspiration syndrome of neonates after birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PCOS is diagnosed according the Rotterdam criteria . It requires 2 out of 3 symptoms: 1.&#xD;
      Hyperandrogenism or excess levels of androgen)- clinical and/ or biochemical (presence of&#xD;
      hirsutism, acne or alopecia). 2. Oligo or anovulation (including menstrual dysfunction). 3.&#xD;
      PCO-M polycystic ovaries morphology (over 12 follicles, 2-9 mm or increased ovarian volume).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The term microbiome describes the genetic material of all the microbes (bacteria, fungi,&#xD;
      protozoa and viruses) that live onside and inside the human body. It is important for&#xD;
      development of the body, immunity and nutrition. The microbiome may influence the&#xD;
      susceptibility to different infectious diseases and contribute to chronic illnesses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gut microbiota contains 100 trillion microbes. When discussing gut bacteria, it is&#xD;
      primarily referred to the large intestine (colon). Lately, interest regarding the association&#xD;
      between PCOS women and gut macrobiotic have been emerged. Hyperandrogenism was correlated&#xD;
      with those changes in the microbiota which reflects the fact that the microbiome can&#xD;
      influence the development and pathology of PCOS . Preliminary studies have shown that&#xD;
      different bacterial species colonize the gut of PCOS induced animals compared to controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A novel theory was developed concerning the development of PCOS. A diet high of sugars sets&#xD;
      as a convenient platform for gram negative bacteria (&quot;bad&quot; bacteria) while reducing &quot;good&quot;&#xD;
      bacteria. The cell wall of the gram negative bacteria is comprised of lipopolysaccharide&#xD;
      (LPS) which stimulates the immune system. The high sugar diet increases the permeability of&#xD;
      the gut (&quot;leaky gut&quot;) leading to chronic inflammation which produces impaired insulin&#xD;
      receptor function. The insulin facilitates an increase in the production of androgens by the&#xD;
      ovaries which leads to PCOS .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dysbiosis was correlated with sex hormone levels and ovarian changes. In addition,&#xD;
      treating PCOS using lactobacillus (&quot;good&quot; bacteria) transplantation showed improved ovarian&#xD;
      functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even though, several studies established the connection between the dysbiosis of the gut and&#xD;
      PCOS, only a few studies were conducted on the association between the vaginal microbiome and&#xD;
      the development of PCOS. To detail, the vaginal microbiome in PCOS is more diverse and&#xD;
      heterogeneous, with the relative abundance of certain species (such as Mycoplasma) and lower&#xD;
      level of others (such as Lactobacillus which keeps the vagina acidic) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, should this association be strengthen between the microbiome of the gut and vagina&#xD;
      to PCOS, it could serve as grounds to new horizons for treatment. There are several therapies&#xD;
      for PCOS treatment (Life style interventions, improving metabolic dysfunction and medical&#xD;
      treatment ), however, currently, there is no ideal therapy that fully treats all the clinical&#xD;
      features.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to all the aforementioned, we aim of this study is to explore the diversity and&#xD;
      alternations of the vaginal and the gut microbiome in patients with PCOS during common&#xD;
      therapeutic interventions and connect them to different phenotypes of the syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design A prospective longitudinal case control study that will be conducted at Sheba&#xD;
      Medical Center (tertiary medical center).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study group will include 20 women in fertility age (age 18-42) diagnosed with PCOS according&#xD;
      to the Rotterdam Criteria who haven't started any kind of treatment. The control group would&#xD;
      be healthy women matched by age. Women in both groups will be recruited at the Endocrine&#xD;
      outpatient's clinics. All women will sign informed consent form after receiving information&#xD;
      on the study from one of the research team members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vaginal and rectal samples will be collected during the regular clinic visits that will be&#xD;
      set by the medical interventions requirements (including: dietary recommendations, physical&#xD;
      activity, hormonal contraception, insulin resistance treatment, fertility treatment,&#xD;
      pregnancy follow-up):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. at first visit after recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 1 month following first intervention&#xD;

        3. 3 month following first intervention&#xD;
