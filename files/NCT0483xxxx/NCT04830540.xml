  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to understand the impact of wearing shoes with a compliant, energy&#xD;
      absorbing midsole material, outside of athletic training sessions on the mechanics of&#xD;
      movement, performance, and perceived joint pain and stiffness. Advances in material science&#xD;
      have led to a wider range of cushioning system material properties and mid and outsole&#xD;
      geometries in footwear. While there are many marketing claims about the potential health&#xD;
      benefits of this new class of footwear these have not yet been investigated in well-designed&#xD;
      scientific studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that the intervention shoe as compared to the control will reduce&#xD;
      self-reported joint pain and stiffness, improve ankle plantarflexion function and increase&#xD;
      intersegmental foot motion during walking.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Participants will be asked to make 2 visits, 6 weeks apart, to the Umass Biomechanics Lab in&#xD;
      the Totman Building at UMass Amherst for gait analysis and biomechanical performance testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the first study visit, participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups.&#xD;
      Participants assigned to the control group will be asked to continue wearing their typical&#xD;
      shoes and to complete every two weeks the footwear and injury log provided. Individuals&#xD;
      assigned to the intervention group will be provided with 2 styles of the OOFOS recovery&#xD;
      shoes, and will be asked to wear the OOFOS slide, sandal and/or closed toe shoes as their&#xD;
      primary footwear outside training and competition for the 6 weeks between study visits.&#xD;
      Intervention participants will also be asked to complete a daily shoe wear log and a shoe&#xD;
      comfort assessment survey every other week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each study visit, subjects will be asked to read and sign an Informed Consent Form, and&#xD;
      will also be asked questions about their health, exercise, and injury history. To prepare for&#xD;
      the data collection, participants will be asked to change into a pair of shorts and tight&#xD;
      shirt that will be provided. Anatomic measurements will then be made with a measuring tape,&#xD;
      and ankle flexibility will be assessed by manually moving the participant's ankle into the&#xD;
      most flexed and most extended position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reflective markers will then be placed on subject's feet/shoes, legs, thighs, hips,&#xD;
      shoulders, and arms to record 3-D limb kinematics. To place the markers, we will put little&#xD;
      circles of double-sided tape on skin or clothing, with reflective balls on the outer side.&#xD;
      The position of the reflective markers will be recorded by high-speed infrared cameras&#xD;
      surrounding the data collection space. Subjects will also be instrumented with&#xD;
      electromyography (EMG) sensors on the skin over muscles of the leg, to measure the activity&#xD;
      of those muscles. Before placing the EMG sensors, a small patch of skin will be shaved to&#xD;
      ensure the sensor stays in place and captures the signals needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once markers have been placed, subjects will stand in the data collection space to record a&#xD;
      standing calibration trial of the markers. The standing calibration trial will be used to&#xD;
      create a computer model on which data analysis will be performed. Subjects will then walk on&#xD;
      a long walkway with the cameras surrounding it at a both self-selected and a set speed of 1.4&#xD;
      m/s. This will be repeated several times until at least 5 successful trials have been&#xD;
      recorded. A successful trial means that the walking speed varies by no more than 5 % from the&#xD;
      previous trial. Subjects will perform the walking trials barefoot and in the OOFOS sandal and&#xD;
      closed toe shoes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the gait analysis described above, calf muscle strength will be assessed using a&#xD;
      dynamometer. The subject will sit with the leg, hips, and torso securely strapped to prevent&#xD;
      unwanted movement. Subjects will then preform isometric and dynamic contractions; enough&#xD;
      repetitions will be allowed to facilitate learning of the technique required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final test will be a maximum vertical jump height test. Subjects will stand in the middle&#xD;
      of the motion capture area and jump as high as they can from a standing position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the above procedures are completed, the research staff will open the intervention&#xD;
      assignment envelope that will determine if you are assigned to the intervention or control&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
