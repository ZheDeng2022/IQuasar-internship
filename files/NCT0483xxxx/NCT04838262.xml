  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To test our hypotheses, we will enroll healthy adults having no history of mood disorders and&#xD;
      adults with major depressive disorder (MDD) having a broad range of depressive symptom&#xD;
      severity. After screening, subjects will meet with the research coordinator or an&#xD;
      investigator for a discussion, with opportunity for questions, before applicable consent&#xD;
      forms are obtained. Daily stress processes will be assessed using an ecological momentary&#xD;
      assessment approach for 8 consecutive days. On the last day of the daily stress assessment,&#xD;
      we will directly measure muscle sympathetic nerve activity, blood pressure, and heart rate&#xD;
      during acute laboratory-based cognitive, emotional, and physiological interventions to induce&#xD;
      a stress response. A venous blood sample will be taken for measurements of metabolic and&#xD;
      renal health and systemic inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To examine the effect of daily psychosocial stressor exposure on acute sympathetic&#xD;
      stress reactivity in MDD. Two stressor exposure indicators will be calculated: stressor&#xD;
      frequency (i.e., percentage of interview days during which at least one stressor occurred)&#xD;
      and total stress (i.e., total number of stressors reported across all interview days) and&#xD;
      will be related to the magnitude of responsiveness to the acute stress interventions. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that the slope of this relation will be steeper in adults with MDD compared to&#xD;
      healthy non-depressed adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To determine the relation between negative affective reactivity to daily psychosocial&#xD;
      stressor exposure and acute sympathetic stress reactivity in MDD. Negative affective&#xD;
      reactivity will be calculated as the change in affect on days when stressors occurred&#xD;
      compared to one's typical affect on non-stressor days and will be related to the magnitude of&#xD;
      responsiveness to the acute stress interventions. We hypothesize that the slope of this&#xD;
      relation will be steeper in adults with MDD compared to healthy non-depressed adults.&#xD;
