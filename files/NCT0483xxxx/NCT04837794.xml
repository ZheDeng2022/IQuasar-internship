      The investigators aim to validate if a digital tool for increased self-management of chronic&#xD;
      pain can improve the quality of life for patients with chronic pain. The validation is based&#xD;
      on the change in pain interference (Quality of life), pain intensity, physical functioning,&#xD;
      depression, and anxiety based on self-reported information from baseline to study end.&#xD;

      Chronic pain is today an increasing health problem in both Europe and US, with an estimation&#xD;
      of about 90 million people affected in Europe (Breivik, H. et al., 2006) and 100 million&#xD;
      people in US (Relieving Pain in America, IOM Report 2011), or 20-30% of the adult population&#xD;
      around the world. Chronic pain is defined as a condition that lasts for at least three to six&#xD;
      months, after the normal healing period of an injury. Medical interventions offered in&#xD;
      clinics around the globe are unfortunately not giving the results needed to give back the&#xD;
      quality of life the patients had prior to the onset of the pain. The treatments offered today&#xD;
      do sometimes reduce pain, but the effect is minor, and new treatment regimens are needed&#xD;
      (Relieving Pain in America, 2011). Recent quality assurance registry measurements in Sweden&#xD;
      has shown that patient taken part of multi modal treatment regimens, such as the acceptance&#xD;
      and commitment therapy, (ACT) show that less then 40% of the patients have a decline in the&#xD;
      pain level of 1 level on the VAS scale, 55% has no effect and 9 % has an increased level of&#xD;
      pain after going through the program (Nationel Register for Pain Rehabilitation, Sweden 2017)&#xD;
      The study objective is to evaluate how the use of a digital pain coach, based on artificial&#xD;
      intelligence that improves the self-management of pain will decrease the pain interference&#xD;
      and thereby increase QoL among chronic pain patients, as measured by PROMIS pain interference&#xD;
      6a. We will here compare the improvement of quality of life by a decrease in pain&#xD;
      interference, measured by PROMIS, in patients who follow their traditional treatment plan&#xD;
      provided by the Pain Clinic with the addition of using a web application for increased self&#xD;
      management of pain. The theory behind the study and the development of the device is&#xD;
      supported by previously known data, showing that self-management has an effect and is&#xD;
      important to the treatment by helping patients to believe in their own capacity to control&#xD;
      their pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present investigation aims at exploring the effect of including digital tool as an add on&#xD;
      to standard treatment and rehabilitation and will measure the effect it has on:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Decreased pain interference Improved management of long-term pain and its consequences. Hence&#xD;
      self-management of pain Increased function in daily life with the best possible activity and&#xD;
      participation level Improved experience of health-related quality of life Decreased pain&#xD;
      experience&#xD;
