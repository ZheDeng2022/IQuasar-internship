  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In developed countries, the acceleration of the general population ageing has been widely&#xD;
      described for decades, involving changes in public health policies. Among the health issues&#xD;
      arising from this demographic change, the maintenance of cognitive function will be a major&#xD;
      challenge in the next years, both in societal and economic terms. In this regard, some&#xD;
      pharmacological and behavioural (e.g. physical activity, social involvement, intellectually&#xD;
      demanding activities) preventive approaches have been evaluated to improve cognitive function&#xD;
      with ageing. Among them, dietary interventions showed a potential interest to prevent&#xD;
      cognitive decline during ageing. In this sense, there is a growing interest to find&#xD;
      ecological solutions and to meet major societal challenge the use of microalgae as molecule&#xD;
      of interest sources is a recent promising approach. Marine environments harbour a huge&#xD;
      biological diversity of microalgae that represents a large source of almost untapped&#xD;
      bioactive compounds. This biodiversity comprises 200,000 to 2 million species with about&#xD;
      35,000 which are described and 15,000 maintained in culture collections. Microalgae are able&#xD;
      to produce bioactive molecules, such as pigments, fatty acids, peptides and sterols. Some of&#xD;
      these compounds are unique and specifically found in the marine environment and they could be&#xD;
      increasingly used as natural bioactive products for targeted applications. Fucoxanthin is one&#xD;
      of the major carotenoid found in microalgae well known for its neuroprotective effect but to&#xD;
      our knowledge no human studies were realized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus the objective is to evaluate, in healthy older adults, the effect of a 24-week period of&#xD;
      daily supplementation of high and low BrainPhyt, doses on cognitive function parameters&#xD;
      (Spatial Working Memory scores, Attention and vigilance, episodic memory, executive&#xD;
      function), stress, mood, sleep quality and biomarkers.&#xD;
