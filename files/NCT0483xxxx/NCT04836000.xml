  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During rotator cuff tear healing stages, there are complex interactions between a variety of&#xD;
      tissue growth factors and cells, ultimately resulting in tissue that is markedly different&#xD;
      from that of normal, uninjured tendon. Hence, there is a strong drive to investigate the role&#xD;
      of potential therapies in the form of biological augments that may restore the pathologic&#xD;
      tissue to a near normal physiological state. In this context, low-level laser therapy (LLLT)&#xD;
      may be an effective choice in the treatment of nonoperative small and medium-sized rotator&#xD;
      cuff tears (RCT). To the best of our knowledge, there is no randomized controlled study&#xD;
      investigating the effects of the LLLT in patients with a RCT size not exceeding 3 cm.&#xD;
      Therefore, the aim of the current study is to investigate all the possible effects of the&#xD;
      LLLT in terms of functional status, pain-free mobility, and quality-of-life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recently, there is a increasing evidence that the addition of low-level laser therapy (LLLT)&#xD;
      to treatment program of shoulder problems plays an important role in stimulation of healing,&#xD;
      augmenting tissue repair, relief of pain and inflammation, and restoration of function. LLLT,&#xD;
      phototherapy or photobiomodulation refers to the use of photons at a non-thermal irradiance&#xD;
      to alter biological activity. The basic biological mechanism behind the effects of LLLT is&#xD;
      thought to be through absorption of red and near infrared light by mitochondrial&#xD;
      chromophores, in particular cytochrome c oxidase (CCO) which is contained in the respiratory&#xD;
      chain located within the mitochondria, and perhaps also by photoacceptors in the plasma&#xD;
      membrane of cells. It is hypothesized that this absorption of light energy may cause&#xD;
      photodissociation of inhibitory nitric oxide from CCO9 leading to enhancement of enzyme&#xD;
      activity, electron transport, mitochondrial respiration and adenosine triphosphate (ATP)&#xD;
      production. In turn, LLLT alters the cellular redox state which induces the activation of&#xD;
      numerous intracellular signaling pathways, and alters the affinity of transcription factors&#xD;
      concerned with cell proliferation, survival, tissue repair and regeneration.&#xD;

    <measure>Constant-Murley score (Functional Outcome)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It assesses four aspects related to shoulder pathology; two subjective: pain and activities of daily living (ADL) and two objective: range of motion (ROM) and strength. The subjective components can receive up to 35 points and the objective 65, resulting in a possible maximum total score of 100 points (best function). Pain and ADL are answered by the patient; ROM and strength require a physical evaluation and are answered by the orthopaedic surgeon or the physiotherapist</description>

    <measure>Western Ontario Rotator Cuff index (Functional Outcome)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It is a self-administering health questionnaire. It has 21 items, exploring 5 different domains: Physical symptoms, Sports and recreation, Work, Social function, Emotions. Each question uses a visual analogue scale (VAS) - which is a straight line, representing a 100-point scale, ranging from 0-100. The maximum score is 2100 (worst possible symptoms). Zero (0) represents no symptoms at all. To make the final score more clinically friendly, some minor math is involved. The score can be reported as a percentage by subtracting the total from 2100, dividing by 2100, and multiplying by 100. This will give you an overall percentage. Total final WORC scores can, therefore, range from 0% ( lowest functional status level) to 100% (the highest functional status).</description>

    <description>The 5-level EQ-5D version (EQ-5D-5L) essentially consists of 2 pages: the EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS). The descriptive system comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The EQ VAS records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale, where the endpoints are labelled 'The best health you can imagine' and 'The worst health you can imagine'. The VAS can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome that reflect the patient's own judgement.</description>

    <description>For Experimental Group A Gallium-aluminum-arsenide (Ga-Al-As) diode laser instrument (Roland Serie, Elettronica Pagani, Paderno, Italy, Mod IR 27/1) will be used (wavelength 904 nm, 5500 Hz frequency, 27 W maximum power output per pulse, 13.2 mW average power, 0.8-cm2 spot size, 1.6 J of total energy will be delivered per point at each session at a power density of 16.5 mW/cm2, and the cumulative energy per point for all sessions was 16 J).&#xD;
Ga-Al-As laser therapy will be applied to experimental group patients two times per week for 12 weeks in 10-min sessions. LLLT will be applied over the tuberculum majus and minus, the anterior and posterior faces of the capsule, and the subacromial regions. Each point will be treated for 120 sec. The head of the instrument will be held perpendicular to the body surface and in skin contact without pressure.</description>

    <description>For Control Group The rehabilitation program for the 3 groups will be equal and consist of 3 phases.Each phase contains several recommended exercises from which the physiotherapist can choose, with respect to restrictions. The physiotherapist decides when the patient is ready to move on to the next phase, considering aspects of quality of motion and pain. Phase 1 includes standardized information about the condition and exercises aimed at promoting good posture and stabilization of the scapula. Initially, range of motion exercises that unload the rotator cuff will be used, such as the wall slide and supported active flexion on a table using a ball and active assisted exercises in elevation, abduction, and external rotation. Phase 2 contains active unloaded exercises in elevation, external, and internal rotation as well as isometric strengthening exercises. Phase 3 includes dynamic strengthening exercises for the rotator cuff and scapula stabilizers.</description>
