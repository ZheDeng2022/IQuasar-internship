    <textblock>
      Observational study on patients with dilated cardiomyopathy aims to investigate the&#xD;
      correlation between cardiac fibrosis, as indicated by cardiac magnetic resonance, and the&#xD;
      prognosis of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, and further to explore biomarkers for&#xD;
      cardiac fibrosis and adverse prognosis of dilated cardiomyopathy. Therefore, endpoints&#xD;
      indluding all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death, ventricular arrythmia, non-fatal stroke,&#xD;
      non-fatal myocardial infarction, sudden death, successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation will&#xD;
      be evaluated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this observational study on patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, 500 eligible patients,&#xD;
      who were diagnosed as dilated cardiomyopathy by echocardiography, will be recruited with a&#xD;
      median follow up of 5 years.Patients will be excluded who develop cardiac enlargement caused&#xD;
      by other factors such as myocardial ischemia, myocarditis, diabetic cardiomyopathy, valvular&#xD;
      heart disease, congenital heart disease; who had underwent heart transplatation; who are not&#xD;
      suitable for the present study due to maligant tumor or severe trauma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible individuals, identified based on echocardiography and medical records, were invited&#xD;
      to a community clinic by phone. For eligible individuals, study data were comprised of a&#xD;
      self-administered questionnaire, anthropometric features, laboratory examinations,&#xD;
      echocardiographic and/or cardiac magetic resnonance data. Anthropometric data were measured&#xD;
      by experienced research staff in the morning under standardized conditions. Echocardiographic&#xD;
      measuring were performed by three skilled sonographers independently, based on routine&#xD;
      protocols on an HP5500 (Phillips Medical System, Boston, Massachusetts, USA) per current&#xD;
      guidelines. Venous blood samples were collected in the morning following overnight fasting.&#xD;
      Laboratory procedures were performed under standardized conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints including all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death, sudden death (ICD-Code I46.1,&#xD;
      R96), ventricular tachycardia(ICD-code I47.2)/fibrillation/flutter(ICD-code I49.0),&#xD;
      hospitalization for heart failure(ICD-Code I50), heart transplatation ((ICD-Code Z94.1),&#xD;
      non-fatal stroke(ICD-Code I60, I61, I63, I64), non-fatal myocardial infarction (ICD-Code&#xD;
      I21), sudden death (ICD-Code I46.1, R96), successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ICD-Code&#xD;
      I46.0) will be evaulated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Across the whole observational study, 50 endpoints are anticipated to occur annually, and&#xD;
      therefore the sample size was estimated to be approximately 500 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection and management will be conducted via electronic data collection (EDC). Source&#xD;
      data will be checked regularly to assess the accuracy and completeness. For statistical&#xD;
      analysis, continuous variables are presented as mean±standard deviation (SD), and compared by&#xD;
      the Student t-test. Categorical variables are presented as frequency and assessed by the χ2&#xD;
      test. SAS 9.4 for Windows (release 6.11, USA) is to be utilized for statistical analysis.&#xD;

    <measure>Ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation and flutter</measure>
    <time_frame>5 YEARS.</time_frame>
    <description>Ventricular tachycardia is an abnormally fast heart beat (with three or more consecutive heart beats at least 100 beats per minute) that originates from one of the ventricles in the heart (ICD-code I47.2), respectively.Ventricular fibrillation (VF) is a very rapid (150-500 bpm) irregularly irregular disorganized ventricular rhythm of varying configuration; with time, the amplitude of the fibrillation wave becomes progressively smaller, particularly immediately before death. Ventricular flutter (VFL) is a very rapid (180-250 bpm) and regular ectopic ventricular rhythm with undulations of equal amplitude and usually rapidly degenerates to VF(ICD-code I49.0).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>nonfatal stroke</measure>
    <time_frame>5 YEARS.</time_frame>
    <description>Stroke (ICD-Code I60, I61, I63, I64) is a focal neurological deficit with symptoms continuing for more than 24 hours or leading to death with no apparent cause other than vascular. Stroke as an endpoint in this study includes definite ischemic stroke, primary intracerebral hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage with evidence from CT or MRI scan within 14 days of onset or autopsy confirmation, and stroke of unknown type etiology when CT, MRI, or autopsy are not done and information is inadequate to diagnose the etiology definitely.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>nonfatal myocardial infarction</measure>
    <time_frame>5 YEARS.</time_frame>
    <description>Acute myocardial infarction (MI) (ICD-Code I21) is defined when any one of the following criteria occurs. (1) Detection of a rise and/or fall of cardiac biomarker values, with at least one value above the 99th percentile upper reference limit and with at least one of the following manifestations: symptoms of ischaemia that should have lasted for at least 30 minutes and should not have been responsive to sublingual administration of nitrates; new or presumed new significant ST-segment-T wave changes or new left bundle branch block (LBBB); development of pathological Q waves in the ECG; imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion abnormality. (2) Identification of an intracoronary thrombus by angiography or autopsy. (3) Cardiac death with symptoms suggestive of myocardial ischaemia and presumed new ischaemic ECG changes or new LBBB, but death occurred before cardiac biomarkers were obtained, or before cardiac biomarker values would be increased.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>sudden death</measure>
    <time_frame>5 YEARS.</time_frame>
    <description>Sudden death (ICD-Code I46.1, R96) encompasses any death of unknown origin occurring instantly or within an estimated 24 hours after the onset of acute symptoms as well as unattended death for which no likely cause can be established by autopsy or recent medical history.</description>

HF cases may also be adjudicated as chronic stable HF but this is not considered an outcome of the present study.</description>
