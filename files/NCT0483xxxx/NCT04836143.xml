      The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the proportion of eyes that do not meet the&#xD;
      eligibility criteria of clinical trials on neovascular AMD among the entire sample of eyes&#xD;
      diagnosed with treatment-naïve neovascular AMD. The eligibility criteria of the VEGF&#xD;
      Trap-Eye: Investigation of Efficacy and Safety in Wet AMD (VIEW) studies, were used for this&#xD;
      investigation.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neovascular AMD is one of the primary causes of severe visual impairment in developed&#xD;
      countries. Previously, laser photocoagulation or photodynamic therapy was used as its&#xD;
      mainstay treatment. However, the efficacy of these treatment modalities has obvious&#xD;
      limitations. In 2006, the FDA-approved anti-VEGF agent, ranibizumab, was introduced, followed&#xD;
      by aflibercept in 2012. In addition, the off-label use of bevacizumab has been widely&#xD;
      adopted. The introduction of these anti-VEGF agents has markedly improved the treatment&#xD;
      outcomes of neovascular AMD, resulting in a significant decrease in the rate of visual loss&#xD;
      and blindness. Currently, clinical trials are actively being performed to develop better&#xD;
      treatment methods for neovascular AMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In general, conducting clinical trials are expensive and require years to complete.&#xD;
      Therefore, estimating the time required to complete the planned patient enrollment is&#xD;
      essential for establishing an efficient clinical trial plan. Clinical trials are usually&#xD;
      conducted in a controlled environment and have sophisticated eligibility criteria. Thus, all&#xD;
      patients cannot be enrolled into a trial, and some of them, or sometimes the majority of&#xD;
      them, are excluded on the basis of the eligibility criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimation of the proportion of patients in the study population who do not meet the&#xD;
      eligibility criteria is important for several reasons. First, it may help to identify whether&#xD;
      the results of the clinical trial can be applied to the real-world patients. Secondly, it may&#xD;
      also help to predict the time required to finish the planned patient enrollment. In addition,&#xD;
      if a particular set of criteria results in the exclusion of a relatively large number of&#xD;
      patients, patient enrollment in future clinical trials could be accelerated by modifying some&#xD;
      of these criteria. Furthermore, since the characteristics of neovascular AMD differ between&#xD;
      Asian and Caucasian populations, obtaining data on Asian populations would be of great value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the proportion of eyes that do&#xD;
      not meet the eligibility criteria of clinical trials on neovascular AMD among the entire&#xD;
      sample of eyes diagnosed with treatment-naïve neovascular AMD. The eligibility criteria of&#xD;
      the VEGF Trap-Eye: Investigation of Efficacy and Safety in Wet AMD (VIEW) studies, were used&#xD;
      for this investigation.&#xD;
