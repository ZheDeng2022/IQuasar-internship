  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an investigator-initiated, proof-of-concept, randomised, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, single-centre phase II study aiming to evaluate the efficacy, safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of self-administered subcutaneous 120 µg dasiglucagon with an investigational&#xD;
      trial device (i.e. a multi-dose reusable pen) for the treatment of postprandial hypoglycaemia&#xD;
      after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery. The study is divided into an in-patient and&#xD;
      out-patient part.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of the study is to compare the effects of self-administered 120 µg&#xD;
      dasiglucagon versus placebo on continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)-assessed time spent in&#xD;
      hypoglycaemia in RYGB-operated individuals in an out-patient setting.&#xD;

      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before inclusion in the study, the participants will complete a screening visit and a blinded&#xD;
      14-day continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) run-in period to ascertain a regular occurrence of&#xD;
      postprandial hypoglycaemia (IG &lt;3.9 mmol/l, ≥3 times/week). After enrolment in the study, the&#xD;
      participants will wear a CGM for the entirety of the study period (apart from the four weeks&#xD;
      before the follow-up visit). Prior to the first mixed meal test (MMT) during the in-patient&#xD;
      part, the subjects will be randomised into one of four double-blinded treatment sequences&#xD;
      consisting of an in-patient part (two MMTs) follow by a nine weeks out-patient part (two&#xD;
      times four weeks per out-patient part with an interposed washout period of one week) and&#xD;
      ended with a follow-up visit four weeks after out-patient part completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the in-patient part, the participants will undergo two separate MMTs, with a minimum&#xD;
      of 7 days in-between, accompanied by one of the following double-blind, randomised,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled crossover interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Subcutaneous placebo self-administration&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Subcutaneous 120 µg dasiglucagon self-administration&#xD;
&#xD;
      The out-patient part is divided into two double-blinded, randomised, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      crossover out-patient parts with of the following interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Subcutaneous placebo self-administration&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Subcutaneous 120 µg dasiglucagon self-administration&#xD;
