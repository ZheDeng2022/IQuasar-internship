  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to confirm the safety and efficacy of diazoxide as an additive to&#xD;
      hyperkalemic cardioplegia in patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass.&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that diazoxide combined with hyperkalemic cardioplegia provides&#xD;
      superior myocardial protection and reduced myocardial stunning compared with standard&#xD;
      cardioplegia alone. The investigators will randomize 30 patients in a 2:1 fashion to&#xD;
      treatment vs control. Safety will be assessed by comparing mean arterial blood pressure&#xD;
      measurements, glucose levels and incidence of adverse events between the two groups. Efficacy&#xD;
      will be assessed by comparing right and left ventricular function in pre-operative vs&#xD;
      post-operative transesophageal echocardiograms, need for mechanical circulatory support, ease&#xD;
      of separation from bypass and Vasoactive Inotrope Score (VIS) between the two groups. The&#xD;
      information gained could pave the way for the use of Katp (Potassium-atp) channel openers to&#xD;
      prevent stunning, improve patient outcomes, and reduce health care costs related to&#xD;
      myocardial stunning that requires inotropic and mechanical support following cardiac surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized blinded Phase I clinical trial. Thirty patients total will be randomized&#xD;
      on a 2:1 basis to treatment (IV Diazoxide added to cardioplegia) vs control (cardioplegia&#xD;
      alone). Diazoxide will be added to the first dose of cardioplegia only. Subsequent doses of&#xD;
      cardioplegia will not contain additives.&#xD;
