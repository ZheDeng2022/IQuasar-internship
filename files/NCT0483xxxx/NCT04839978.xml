  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The target population is students attending high schools in small rural towns in the 14&#xD;
      counties that partially or fully fall within the Cherokee Nation reservation. Following&#xD;
      recruitment of 20 school-based clusters, clusters are allocated to either the intervention&#xD;
      condition or delayed-intervention control condition using constrained randomization.&#xD;
      Constrained randomization helps to ensure balanced cluster sizes as well as similar levels of&#xD;
      risk between the intervention and control at baseline. Study participants include all10th&#xD;
      grade students enrolled in the participating study high schools and students will be followed&#xD;
      into the first year after their expected graduation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The national public health opioid crisis has disproportionately burdened rural White&#xD;
      populations, and disproportionately burdened American Indian populations. Therefore, the&#xD;
      Cherokee Nation (CN) and Emory University public health scientists have designed an opioid&#xD;
      prevention trial to be conducted in at-risk rural communities in the CN (in northeast&#xD;
      Oklahoma) with primarily White and American Indian adolescents and young adults. The goal of&#xD;
      this study is to implement and evaluate a theory-based, integrated multi-level community&#xD;
      intervention designed to prevent the onset and escalation of opioid and other drug misuse.&#xD;
      The researchers propose a cluster randomized trial building directly on the success of their&#xD;
      most recent previous trial, which demonstrated that the intervention effectively reduced&#xD;
      alcohol and other drug use among American Indian and other youth living within the CN. Two&#xD;
      distinct intervention approaches-community organizing as implemented in the established&#xD;
      Communities Mobilizing for Change and Action (CMCA) intervention protocol, and universal&#xD;
      school-based brief intervention and referral as implemented in the established Connect&#xD;
      intervention protocol -will be expanded and integrated to further enhance effects in&#xD;
      preventing and reducing opioid misuse. The CMCA and Connect interventions were originally&#xD;
      designed to target adolescent alcohol use, but nevertheless showed significant beneficial&#xD;
      effects on use of other drugs, including prescription drug misuse. The proposed study will:&#xD;
      (1) further improve the design of the interventions with increased focus on opioids, (2) test&#xD;
      the expanded, integrated versions in a cluster randomized trial, and (3) design and test new&#xD;
      systems for sustained implementation within existing structures of the Cherokee Nation.&#xD;
      Building upon the extant prevention science evidence, this study will respond to a gap in&#xD;
      evidence concerning opioid misuse prevention among at-risk adolescents transitioning to young&#xD;
      adulthood among American Indian and other rural youth.&#xD;
