  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Enteral nutrition is often preferred in intensive care units, but it brings some potential&#xD;
      complications in addition to its benefits. It is stated that abdominal massage and in-bed&#xD;
      exercise in intensive care patients can reduce complications related to the gastrointestinal&#xD;
      system when performed under appropriate conditions. Considering the ease of application, low&#xD;
      cost and non-invasive nature of abdominal massage and in-bed exercises, it is predicted that&#xD;
      patients will benefit in case of gastrointestinal complications and positive effects on&#xD;
      comfort. It is also thought that these interventions that support independent nursing roles&#xD;
      will contribute to the establishment of standards of care and the professionalization process&#xD;
      by using evidence-based practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is conducted to evaluate the effects of abdominal massage and in-bed exercise on&#xD;
      gastrointestinal complications and patient comfort in intensive care patients who are fed&#xD;
      enterally.&#xD;

      gastrointestinal complications and patient comfort in intensive care patients who are fed&#xD;
      enterally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research is planned to be completed between April 15, 2021 and July 15, 2022. The&#xD;
      universe of the study, which was conducted as a randomized controlled study model, consisted&#xD;
      of patients with intubated enteral nutrition in the internal intensive care units of&#xD;
      Diyarbakır Gazi Yaşargil Training and Research Hospital and Dicle University Medical Faculty.&#xD;
      Participants were planned to be assigned to the experimental and control groups by&#xD;
      stratification and block randomization (Abdominal massage group = 46 participant, in-bed&#xD;
      exercise group = 46 participant and control group = 46 participant). Demographic&#xD;
      Characteristics Form, Enteral Nutrition Follow-up Form, Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale,&#xD;
      Intensive Care Pain Observation Scale and Comfort Behavior Checklist were used to collect&#xD;
      data. According to the characteristics of the data, t test, ANOVA test, Mann Whitney U test&#xD;
      and correlation were measured in independent groups.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>In the study, patients will be stratified according to their gender (male and female) status and the blocking process will be performed. 46 patients will be included in each group by repeating the layers formed according to the specified variables 3 times. The stratified patients will be assigned to the experimental and control groups, and the research groups will be written on papers for the determined sets and a lot will be drawn.&#xD;

    <description>In-bed exercises are passive exercises performed by caregivers when the patient is dependent on the bed, that is, when he cannot actively move on his own. These are movements applied to all joints of the upper and lower extremities and in all directions. Exercises are done in all directions on finger joints of both hands, wrists, elbow and shoulder joints, finger joints of both feet, ankles, knee and hip joints.</description>
