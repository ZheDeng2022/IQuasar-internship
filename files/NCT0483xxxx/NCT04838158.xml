    <textblock>
      The study enrolled 33 patients with confirmed recurrent patellar dislocation, including 6&#xD;
      patients with bilateral involvement. In the study group, both side hamstring muscle were&#xD;
      evaluated at the velocities of 60 and 180 deg/s for the following parameters: peak torque,&#xD;
      torque in 30 degree of the knee flexion, angle of peak torque and peak torque hamstring to&#xD;
      quadriceps ratio (H/Q ratio).&#xD;

      The study enrolled 33 patients with confirmed recurrent patellar dislocation, including 6&#xD;
      patients with bilateral involvement. The study group consisted of 20 girls and 13 boys with&#xD;
      average age at the time of the study 16.2 years (range: 8 to 17 years, SD 2.7). For the&#xD;
      purpose of the study, a control group of 18 healthy subjects (12 girls and 6 boys) aged on&#xD;
      the average 15.7 years (range:13 to 17 years, SD 1.5), was recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following study inclusion criteria were applied: recurrent patellar dislocation,&#xD;
      correctly completed testing protocol, age under 18 years at the time of testing. Subjects&#xD;
      with osteochondral fracture and those with a history of the knee surgery were excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient underwent an isokinetic examination on Biodex System 3 (Biodex Multi-Joint&#xD;
      System - Pro, Biodex Medical Systems, Inc. New York, USA). In the study group, both side&#xD;
      hamstring muscle were evaluated at the velocities of 60 and180 deg/s for the following&#xD;
      parameters: peak torque (PT), torque in 30 degree of the knee flexion (T 30 deg.), angle of&#xD;
      peak torque (APT) and peak torque hamstring to quadriceps ratio (H/Q ratio).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Isokinetic measurements were made by a trained, experienced physiotherapist. After a proper&#xD;
      warm-up and instruction, the test performed 10 full repetitions, the best result was&#xD;
      recorded. The results of the peak torque (PT) of both test and control limbs were then&#xD;
      compared with the normative data for age and gender available in the literature. In addition,&#xD;
      we compared the peak torque (PT), torque in 30 degrees of the knee flexion (T 30 deg.), angle&#xD;
      of peak torque (APT) and peak torque hamstring to quadriceps ratio (H/Q ratio) of involved&#xD;
      and uninvolved knee flexor strength in the study group. Depending on the data distribution,&#xD;
      the nonparametric Wilcoxon's test or the parametric t-test for the related data was applied.&#xD;
      Statistical significance was assumed for p&lt;0.05. The study was approved by our Institutional&#xD;
      Review Board. Informed consent was obtained and the rights of subjects were protected.&#xD;
