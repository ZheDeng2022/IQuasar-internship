      Results of this project will enable investigators to get information and to compare maternal&#xD;
      and pregnancy characteristics and perinatal outcomes of women with different types of&#xD;
      Diabetes Mellitus and to identify the independent risk factors for adverse perinatal&#xD;
      outcomes. Particularly, the impact of the advanced age, obesity, and type of diabetes on the&#xD;
      course and outcome of pregnancy will be evaluated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of obesity and metabolic diseases (such as type 2 diabetes mellitus,&#xD;
      dyslipidaemia, and cardiovascular diseases) has increased in recent years, in both&#xD;
      industrialized and developing countries. Diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the most common&#xD;
      disorders which occurred during pregnancy. Approximately 15% of pregnancies worldwide are&#xD;
      thought to be affected by preexisting or gestational insulin-dependent (type 1) or&#xD;
      independent (type 2) diabetes mellitus (DM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The utility of mid- and third trimester ultrasound parameters will be assessed for prediction&#xD;
      of intrapartal events and perinatal outcomes in patients with diabetes mellitus. The&#xD;
      importance of mid-trimester uterine artery blood flow and foetal biometry will be&#xD;
      investigated for prediction of intrapartal events and perinatal outcomes in patients with&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus. Moreover, an investigation of the utility of third trimester (measured at&#xD;
      30 and 34 weeks of gestation) ultrasound scan will be carried out for prediction of&#xD;
      intrapartal events and perinatal outcomes in patients with diabetes mellitus. Additionally,&#xD;
      researchers will assess the relationship between the cerebro-placental ratio (CPR) and&#xD;
      intrapartum and perinatal outcomes in pregnancies complicated by different types of Diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus to determine if the CPR measured at 30 and 34 weeks of gestation is predictive of&#xD;
      adverse obstetric and perinatal outcomes. At the end, investigators will evaluate the role of&#xD;
      the addition of the UAPI to the CPR, alone or as CPUR [cerebro-placental-uterine ratio&#xD;
      (CPUR)], in the improvement of the ability of CPR to predict APO at the end of pregnancy in&#xD;
      any subgroup of diabetic patients. Finally, this project will enable precise intervention and&#xD;
      resource saving as well as provide evidence for preventable targets development.&#xD;

    <description>Based on DM type, all women will be divided into four groups: prepregnancy/preexisting DM insulin-dependent or independent (types I and II; classes B, C, and D) and gestational DM (GDM) with or without the need for insulin therapy (DM classes A1 and A2). In the case of gestational DM, the gestational week at the time of diagnosis will be registered. We will consider whether women are diagnosed with another preexisting disease (endocrinological or another one) before or during pregnancy, in order to check the relationship of this disease and their DM and potential risks for pregnancy.</description>

The prepregnancy body mass index (BMI; kg/m2) will be calculated using the self-reported prepregnancy maternal weight; the pregnancy weight gain (kg) will be calculated by the difference between final pregnancy weight and prepregnancy maternal weight and was classified according to the prepregnancy BMI.</description>
