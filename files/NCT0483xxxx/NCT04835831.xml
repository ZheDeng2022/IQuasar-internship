  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-Alcoholic Fatty liver Disease (NAFLD) is a Public Health problem. NAFLD affects nearly&#xD;
      25% of the world's population. NAFLD includes hepatic complications related to insulin&#xD;
      resistance and metabolic inflammation. NAFLD is in fact a continuum of liver abnormalities&#xD;
      that progresses from pure steatosis, to Non-Alcoholic Steato-Hepatitis-NASH, then to hepatic&#xD;
      fibrosis, cirrhosis and even the appearance of primary liver cancer (hepatocellular&#xD;
      carcinoma). Although many drugs are being tested for advanced forms of NAFLD, steatohepatitis&#xD;
      (NASH) with fibrosis and post-NAFLD cirrhosis, there are currently no drugs with marketing&#xD;
      authorization. Excessive and unbalanced dietary intake, excessive physical inactivity and&#xD;
      lack of regular physical activity are major contributors to the development of NAFLD. It is&#xD;
      therefore logical that the preventive and curative treatment of NAFLD is based on hygienic&#xD;
      and dietary measures. Physical exercise alone in patients with NAFLD has been shown to&#xD;
      improve liver steatosis even in the absence of weight loss. Proof of concept of the&#xD;
      improvement in hepatic steatosis has been shown to be achieved by physical activity, whether&#xD;
      or not associated with dietary management. More recently, APA (Adapted Physical Activity) is&#xD;
      thus seen as a new modality of care that will become central to the prevention and treatment&#xD;
      of NAFLD. The aim of this work is to evaluate the decrease in hepatic steatosis by continuous&#xD;
      CAP® and parameters evaluating non-invasive inflammation and hepatic fibrosis in patients&#xD;
      with NAFLD subjected to the application of personalized dietary measures without or with the&#xD;
      performance of personalized and reproducible physical activity via the prescription of&#xD;
      adapted physical activity. The evaluation will be carried out initially, at the end of the&#xD;
      operation and 6 months after the end of the operation in order to look for a persistent&#xD;
      effect of the modification in lifestyle.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) affects nearly 25% of the world's population and&#xD;
      can lead to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma . Exercise alone in patients with NAFLD&#xD;
      has been shown to improve hepatic steatosis. Since 2017, adapted physical activity (APA) has&#xD;
      been a medical prescription by the referring physician in France. APA is thus expected to be&#xD;
      a new treatment modality that will become central to the prevention and treatment of NAFLD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reference examination for the non-invasive quantification of liver steatosis was the&#xD;
      Spectro Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) however this technique is expensive and until now&#xD;
      reserved for research in highly specialized centers. More recently, the analysis of the MRI&#xD;
      signal by a magnetic resonance imaging-derived proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF)&#xD;
      sequence acquired during the performance of a classical MRI scan has been validated as a new,&#xD;
      reliable technique that is easier to use routinely than Spectro MRI. However, different&#xD;
      technical variants currently not standardized for the quantification of steatosis by PDFF MRI&#xD;
      exist. MRI is not widely available and must be performed in a competent and expert center. In&#xD;
      contrast, the quantification of steatosis by ultrasound using the classical &quot;Controlled&#xD;
      Attenuation Parameter&quot; (CAP®) is available thanks to a FibroScan, which is widely distributed&#xD;
      over France. Even if the quantification of steatosis is better by PDFF MRI than by the&#xD;
      classical CAP®, the quantification of steatosis by the classical CAP® is well correlated with&#xD;
      the hepatic histology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, several studies have found a decrease in classical CAP® when applying non-drug&#xD;
      or drug therapies to lose weight and/or improve insulin resistance in patients with NAFLD.&#xD;
      Very recently, Echosens has developed a new technique -the continuous CAP- to improve the&#xD;
      reliability of the classical CAP® in the evaluation of steatosis [Audiere et al. ILC 2020].&#xD;
      Continuous CAP® is no longer based on 10 but on 200 measurements of hepatic steatosis. This&#xD;
      new measurement technique reduces the variability of the measurement of liver steatosis&#xD;
      quantification by 42%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this work is to evaluate the decrease in hepatic steatosis by continuous CAP® and&#xD;
      parameters evaluating non-invasively inflammation and hepatic fibrosis in patients with NAFLD&#xD;
      subjected to the application of personalized dietary measures without or with the performance&#xD;
      of personalized and reproducible physical activity via the prescription of an adapted&#xD;
      physical activity. The evaluation will be carried out initially, at the end of the APA&#xD;
      program and 24 weeks after the end of the APA program in order to look for a persistent&#xD;
      effect of the modification in lifestyle.&#xD;
