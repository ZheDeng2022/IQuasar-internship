      Correlation between myocardial deformation and coronary artery tortuosity in patients with&#xD;
      hypertrophic cardiomyopathy&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Excessive tortuosity of the coronary arteries (TCA) is a somewhat common finding in patients&#xD;
      referred for coronary angiography, reported in 14-40% of patients referred for angiography.&#xD;
      The presence of TCA has been associated with chest pain and myocardial perfusion&#xD;
      abnormalities during stress in the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease. Fluid&#xD;
      dynamic modeling suggests that stress-induced ischemia may be attributable to a reduction in&#xD;
      distal coronary artery perfusion pressure from viscous and turbulence energy losses. The&#xD;
      physiologic reasons for TCA are unclear. Pre-clinical studies where elastases and&#xD;
      collagenases were used to alter arterial morphology together with genetic and pathologic&#xD;
      analysis of rare clinical disorders such as arterial tortuosity syndrome have indicated that&#xD;
      arterial tortuosity arises from abnormalities in arterial elastin fibers and extracellular&#xD;
      matrix. Apart from inherited disorders, some but not all studies have linked TCA with&#xD;
      hypertension and female sex, and with increased left ventricular (LV) mass from pressure but&#xD;
      not volume overload and smaller heart size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is associated with an increased left ventricular (LV) wall&#xD;
      thickness. HCM is the most common genetic heart disease, characterized by marked clinical and&#xD;
      morphologic heterogeneity. Diagnosis is usually based on the echocardiographic finding of&#xD;
      unexplained left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, defined by increased wall thickness in 1 or&#xD;
      more LV segments. LV mass is generally assumed to be increased in patients with&#xD;
      phenotypically expressed HCM, based largely on early pathological studies. TCA among HCM&#xD;
      patients have not been studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disruption of the ordered arrangement of myofibers alters normal cardiac mechanical function,&#xD;
      resulting in temporal and spatial heterogeneity in regional myocardial contractility.&#xD;
      Although global LV function is generally unaltered, asynchrony and asynergy in regional&#xD;
      function lead to delayed diastolic relaxation and impaired diastolic filling. Whilst LV&#xD;
      ejection fraction is frequently normal in both, LV strain assessment could differentiate,&#xD;
      compared to normal person. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR), by virtue of its&#xD;
      high-resolution volumetric reconstruction of the LV chamber, currently affords a highly&#xD;
      accurate and reproducible quantitative assessment of mass . We sought to establish if&#xD;
      cardiovascular magnetic resonance myocardial feature tracking (CMR-FT), an emerging method&#xD;
      allowing accurate assessment of myocardial deformation, differentiates between HCM with or&#xD;
      without TCA. Additionally, CMR assessment of fibrosis and LV hypertrophy allowed association&#xD;
      analyses and comparison of diagnostic capacities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single-center, retrospective, case control study that will evaluate the difference&#xD;
      of TCA between HCM and control in the first part. In the second part, we will use CMR-FT to&#xD;
      compare the myocardial strain between HCM with or without TCA and analyze the relationship of&#xD;
      strain and TCA.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>coronary artery tortuosity and tortuosity score in hypertrophic cardiomypathy patients</measure>
    <time_frame>six months</time_frame>
    <description>Severe tortuosity was defined as ≥2 consecutive curvatures of ≥180° in a major epicardial coronary artery ≥2 mm in diameter . Mild tortuosity was defined as either ≥3 consecutive curvatures of 45° to 90° in a major epicardial coronary artery, or ≥3 consecutive curvatures of 90° to 180° in an artery &lt;2 mm in diameter. The tortuosity score was calculated as a sum of scores for each major epicardial coronary artery (left anterior descending, left circumflex, right coronary artery) with 0=no tortuosity, 1=mild tortuosity,2=tortuosity, 3=severe tortuosity. We will evaluate if the patients have coronary artery tortuosity and assess the number of tortuosity score for every coronary artery and add the score up for every patients.</description>
