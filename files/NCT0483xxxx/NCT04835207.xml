    <textblock>
      Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with its accompanying adverse sequelae is one of the most&#xD;
      common causes of morbidity and mortality in the world .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although reperfusion techniques for ST- elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI ) are&#xD;
      constantly improving, no-reflow can still lead to poor prognosis .&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, the exact mechanism of no-reflow remains unclear, but clinical and laboratory&#xD;
      findings suggest that it is related to the embolism of the capillary bed, ischemic injury,&#xD;
      vascular endothelial dysfunction, production of oxygen free radical , and other factors .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The no-reflow phenomenon is one of complications of poor functional and clinical outcomes for&#xD;
      patients with (AMI) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The no-reflow phenomenon is present in 25% to 30% of patients with (AMI) underwent successful&#xD;
      coronary recanalization, as shown by angiography . The myocardial no-reflow phenomenon is&#xD;
      associated with a reducution of antegrade myocardial blood flow inspite of an open&#xD;
      infarct-related artery in patients with (STEMI ) undergoing (PCI) . Importantly, no-reflow is&#xD;
      known to be related to unfavorable clinical outcome and prognosis . The cause of this complex&#xD;
      phenomenon is the variable combination of four pathogenetic components: distal&#xD;
      atherothrombotic embolization, ischemic injury, reperfusion injury and susceptibility of&#xD;
      coronary microcirculation to injury . As a consequence, appropriate strategies are expected&#xD;
      to prevent or treat these components are expected to avoid the no-reflow. Coronary&#xD;
      reperfusion therapy is widely performed in patients with (AMI) . However, in spite of patency&#xD;
      of the infarct-related artery , there is no guarantee of salvage of myocardium at risk of&#xD;
      ischemia .The no-reflow phenomenon is found in &gt;30% of patients after thrombolysis or&#xD;
      catheter-based (PCI) for (AMI) . It is important, therefore, to be able to predict which&#xD;
      lesions are high risk for no reflow before beginning PCI .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many of the well-accepted risk factors for no-reflow are similar to other well-accepted&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension, smoking, dyslipidemia, diabetes, and other&#xD;
      inflammatory processes. As such, there are some generally accepted measures associated with a&#xD;
      lower incidence of no-reflow following PCI for STEMI. For example, in patients with diabetes,&#xD;
      optimal blood sugar control before the procedure can reduce the occurrence of no-reflow .&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are numerous recognized risk factors for the development of coronary artery disease&#xD;
      (CAD), one of the best known is the association between blood lipids and CAD . Several&#xD;
      prospective studies have established that the risk of cardiac morbidity and mortality is&#xD;
      directly related to the concentration of plasma cholesterol. ' The most prevalent view is&#xD;
      that the increased risk of myocardial infarction associated with elevated plasma cholesterol&#xD;
      levels can be adequately explained on the basis of the increase in number and severity of&#xD;
      coronary atherosclerotic vascular lesions . .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hyperglycemia is associated with The increased mortality in patients with acute myocardial&#xD;
      infarction which caused by a larger infarct size, a high incidence of congestive heart&#xD;
      failure, and cardiogenic shock, and death after AMI., . However, the underlying mechanisms of&#xD;
      these deleterious effects of hyperglycemia are not well understood Uric acid (UA) is a&#xD;
      byproduct the terminal steps of purine catabolism, . uric acid synthesis is increased under&#xD;
      tissue ischemia. Therefore, elevated uric acid may affect prognosis of (AMI). A few studies&#xD;
      have doucomented that UA is associated with therapeutic results in patients with AMI. UA&#xD;
      level is appeared to be related to infarct size and hemodynamic derangement. Although prompt&#xD;
      restoration of myocardial blood flow is very important for patients with AMI, high levels of&#xD;
      UA are doucoumented to be significantly associated with the presence of slow coronary flow&#xD;
