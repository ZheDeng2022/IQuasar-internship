  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Esophageal surgery is a complex surgery, with high post-operative morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
      The incidence of complications associated with esophagectomy varies from 17% to 74%, in the&#xD;
      literature. A section of vagus nerves is conventionally performed during esophagectomy for&#xD;
      cancer, because of oncological margins. The vagus nerve is responsible for the&#xD;
      parasympathetic innervation at the gastrointestinal level, but also at the cardiac and&#xD;
      pulmonary level. The post-operative morbidity of these procedures could be linked in part to&#xD;
      the bilateral section of the vagus nerves, because of their impact on the autonomous&#xD;
      regulation of this vital functions. The main objective of the study is to find a modification&#xD;
      of the sympathomimetic balance pre and post operatively, in patients undergoing&#xD;
      esophagectomy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The sympathomimetic balance was measured using a Holter-ECG heart rate monitor. The&#xD;
      parameters collected were used to calculate the variability of the heart rate, the high&#xD;
      frequencies (HF, reflection of the parasympathetic system), the low frequencies (LF,&#xD;
      reflection of the sympathetic system and the parasympathetic system) and the ratio // LF / HF&#xD;
      (reflection of the sympathetic activity) thanks to Fourier analysis and the use of&#xD;
      HRVanalysis software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The measurements were taken at night, to overcome the great sympathomimetic variabilities due&#xD;
      to external stimulations during the day: one night 3 month before surgery/before the first&#xD;
      chemotherapy, one night between 2 and 4 weeks before hospitalization (remotely of possible&#xD;
      chemotherapy), the night before the intervention (context of hospitalization and preoperative&#xD;
      stress), one night between D7 and D10 (context of hospitalization, and distance from&#xD;
      anesthetic drugs), one night at home between 4 and 8 weeks post-operative, and one night at&#xD;
      home at 3 months post-operative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The measurements were therefore not carried out the first nights following the intervention&#xD;
      to overcome the anesthetic drugs that affect the balance of the autonomic nervous system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A baroreflex measurement was carried out at the patient's entrance, the day before the&#xD;
      intervention, during hospitalization, and the day of discharge. This measure was renewed at 3&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A measurement of patient activity was carried out preoperatively by wearing an actimeter&#xD;
      watch for 1 week then renewed at 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Respiratory Functional Exploration associated with a stress test with calculation of the&#xD;
      VO2max is systematically carried out before the esophageal surgery. A Respiratory Functional&#xD;
      Exploration was renewed 4 to 8 weeks after the intervention, and then at 3 months. the&#xD;
      6-minute walk test was performed at the same time.&#xD;
