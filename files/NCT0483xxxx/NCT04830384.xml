  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to study the preliminary effectiveness of a light therapy and&#xD;
      music device for at-home use to aid the seasoned cigarette smoker in his/her attempt to stop&#xD;
      smoking. This device, called the FQS system, is a type of cold, or non-heat producing laser&#xD;
      and tranquil music system that will emit light and music onto the ear surface, through&#xD;
      commonly found music earphones, available in most electronic stores. The theory behind this&#xD;
      treatment technique is that the light and music will stimulate the part of the brain&#xD;
      responsible for producing chemicals that satisfy the desire for nicotine. If this is correct,&#xD;
      then the user will replace the need for nicotine with the pleasant treatment experience of&#xD;
      light and music therapy.&#xD;

      This study aims to define the safety and physiologic effects that occur when low level light&#xD;
      and music, configured in a wearable binaural head set are employed by seasoned smokers of&#xD;
      cigarettes, with the end result of reducing the desire to smoke. This device use does not&#xD;
      require any complementary or adjunctive drug use. A review of unregulated products that are&#xD;
      marketed for smoking cessation, have as common mechanism of action, the administration and&#xD;
      withdrawal of nicotine in a controlled dosing format. The proposed study device does not&#xD;
      consider the use of the culprit drug, the best pathway to achieve rapid and long-lasting&#xD;
      cessation results. The theoretical principle at work is the competition for absorption by&#xD;
      nicotinic cholinergic receptors located in the brain by nicotine or by the LLLT and music&#xD;
      therapy. If this competition for absorption by two competing elements (cigarettes and the&#xD;
      proposed device) can result in the device &quot;winning the race&quot;, then the neurotransmitters will&#xD;
      respond to the LLLT and music stimulus instead of the serum nicotine and yield a reduced&#xD;
      desire to consume nicotine. As with any new technology, it is essential to learn the variance&#xD;
      between true efficacy and the placebo level of efficacy. This study seeks to define that&#xD;
      variance.&#xD;
