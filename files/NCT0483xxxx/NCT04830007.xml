      The study will be offered to all women who are consultant for an abortion plan are seen in&#xD;
      consultation at the orthogeny center where the study will be conducted. Of these 700 women,&#xD;
      about 10% will not agree to participate in the study and 10% will not meet the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria. Thus it's plane to include 560 patients in the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 1967, the Neuwirth law allowed women to control their fertility by establishing the right&#xD;
      to contraception as a principle. Since then, they have continued to take ownership of the&#xD;
      various contraceptive methods, which are regularly renewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contraceptive coverage is important in France as it is estimated that 92% of women of&#xD;
      childbearing age use a contraceptive method. The pill remains the most widely used method of&#xD;
      contraception (36.5%), ahead of the intrauterine device (25.6%) condoms (15.5%) Several laws&#xD;
      have been introduced from 1967 to today to facilitate access to sexual health care: screening&#xD;
      for sexually transmitted infections, free provision of emergency contraception to minors,&#xD;
      non-prescription delivery of emergency contraception, free consultation at a family planning&#xD;
      and education center, voluntary termination of pregnancy 100%, reimbursement of condoms by&#xD;
      social security.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite all the measures put in place, it is now clear that the number of unplanted&#xD;
      pregnancies is decreasing slightly and the number of abortion has remained stable since 2001.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the latest literature data, several socio-demographic factors appear to play a&#xD;
      role in the rate of use of voluntary termination of pregnancy., including age, socio-cultural&#xD;
      level, marital and economic status and ethnic origin. All the more striking, it appears that&#xD;
      while voluntary termination of pregnancy are mainly related to contraceptive failures, one&#xD;
      third of them involve women who do not have contraception. According to the latest Ined&#xD;
      survey, and in accordance with other data from the literature, the factors associated with&#xD;
      the absence of contraceptive use are multiple: ignorance about fertility, family or cultural&#xD;
      context, cost of contraceptive methods or lack of information related to them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While these studies have looked at the reasons given by women for the lack of contraception,&#xD;
      with little data on the characteristics of these women, particularly socio-demographics and&#xD;
      their reproductive history and in particular in the context of unwanted pregnancy. This&#xD;
      finding leads us to question the factors associated with the absence of contraception among&#xD;
      women in demand of a voluntary termination of pregnancy.&#xD;
