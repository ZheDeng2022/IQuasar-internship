  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hand-foot syndrome (HFS) is a very common adverse event of many chemotherapeutic agents,&#xD;
      especially capecitabine. The HFS can considerably interfere patient quality of life (QoL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current treatments for hand-foot symptoms no have demonstrated 100% efficacy. And, the&#xD;
      dose reduction and treatment interruption are recommended for treatment of HFS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is known that hydration improves the degree of hand-foot syndrome, as it improves moisture&#xD;
      retention and maintain hydration, thereby reducing further desquamation and decreasing&#xD;
      infection risks. But so far there is no evidence of a cream that improves incidence. Besides&#xD;
      that, clinical trials evaluating the use of urea-based moisturizer in patients treated with&#xD;
      capecitabine have not shown efficacy in preventing hand-foot syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of moisturizer based on Thoitaine,&#xD;
      Aloe Vera and Calendula compared to placebo in the prevention of SMP of any degree, in&#xD;
      patients using Capecitabine.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The research product, proposed in this study, was developed to meet the specific hydration&#xD;
      needs of patients undergoing cancer treatment and is produced from nine main ingredients with&#xD;
      natural moisturizing actions based on glycerin, hazelnut extract, shea butter, aloe vera,&#xD;
      calendula, chamomile and oat extract and 2 antioxidants (vitamin E and Thoitaine),&#xD;
      dermatologically tested and approved. The choice of the product was based, mainly, due to its&#xD;
      natural components, whose data from previous studies were extrapolated from radiodermatitis.&#xD;

    <description>Number of Patients who developed Hand-foot Syndrome (HFS) by Toxicity Grade. The incidence and severity of hand-foot syndrome (HFS) developed during chemotherapy will be defined by using the grading system for HFS per the NCI Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 4.03 for all patients assigned who received at least 1 cycle of capecitabine. Investigators assess and fill the grading into the case report form every visit.</description>

    <measure>Quality of Life as Measured by Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI)</measure>

    <description>Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) consists of 10 questions concerning patients' perception of the impact of skin diseases on different aspects of their health-related quality of life over the last week. The DLQI item response options are rated by the participant from 0 (not at all/not relevant) to 3 (very much). The DLQI is calculated by summing the score of each question resulting in a maximum of 30 and a minimum of 0. The higher the score, the more quality of life is impaired. It is self explanatory and is usually completed in one or two minutes.</description>
