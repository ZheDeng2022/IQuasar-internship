  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study iss to analyze the effect of Lycra garments in the axial stabilization&#xD;
      in subjects affected by ataxia, both in acquired cerebellar injuries and malformative&#xD;
      etiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Improvement are expected for what concerns:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  greater stability during stance&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  smoother walking pattern&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  reduction of risk of fall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two groups (acquired and malformative) will be compared.&#xD;
