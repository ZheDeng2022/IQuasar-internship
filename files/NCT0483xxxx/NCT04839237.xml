      This studay evaluates the effect of liraglutide in the treatment of obese patients ande the&#xD;
      influence of genetic factors on the curative effect.Half of participants will receive&#xD;
      Liraglutide alone,while the other half who can not achieving adequate glycaemic control will&#xD;
      receive Liraglutide and metformin in combination.&#xD;

      Background:The rapid growth of obese or overweight people in the world has become a major&#xD;
      social problem. Obese often associated with kinds of metabolic disorders, especially type 2&#xD;
      diabetes, and Liraglutide can effectively reduce weight and improve blood glucose.Previous&#xD;
      studies have indicated that most patients will experience different degrees of weight loss&#xD;
      after using Liraglutide, but there is also a small number of patients with no significant&#xD;
      weight loss.The gene polymorphism among individuals may affect the weight loss effect of&#xD;
      Liraglutide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives：1.To find the relationships between genetic variants and the response of&#xD;
      Liraglutide to treatment of obese patients.2.To investigate the effects of Liraglutide on&#xD;
      weight, metabolism (blood glucose, blood lipid, uric acid, etc.) and gut microbiota in obese&#xD;
      Chinese patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:Half of participants will receive Liraglutide alone,while the other half who can&#xD;
      not achieving adequate glycaemic control will receive Liraglutide and metformin in&#xD;
      combination.&#xD;
