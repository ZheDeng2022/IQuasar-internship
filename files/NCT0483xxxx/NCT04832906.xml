      Study objective: To prove that Ulipristal acetate is an effective line of management for&#xD;
      uterine fibroids by causing a significant decline in fibroid volumes resulting in a&#xD;
      substantial relief of fibroid-related symptoms, and to compare its results with those of&#xD;
      uterine artery embolization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: A randomized control trial. Setting: Maternity Hospital, Ain Shams University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients: Women with symptomatic uterine fibroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions: 70 women were randomly assigned to either Ulipristal Acetate (UA) group or&#xD;
      uterine artery embolization (UAE) group (35 in each group). Both groups were followed up to&#xD;
      detect the decline in fibroid size as well as the improvement of symptoms.&#xD;

      Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women with symptomatic uterine fibroids were recruited into the study after fulfilling the&#xD;
      following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Their age should range from 35 to 50 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Their body mass index (BMI) should range from 18 to 35 Kg/m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The presence of multiple symptomatic type 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 uterine fibroids according to&#xD;
           the FIGO classification.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The dominant fibroid diameter should range from 4 to 8 cm as assessed by ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They should not be seeking future fertility.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They should be refusing any surgical intervention whether myomectomy or hysterectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Post-menopausal status or premature ovarian failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Type 0, 1 and 7 uterine fibroids according to FIGO classification.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Previous myomectomy or any uterine surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Previous or ongoing hormonal treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study sample will be a &quot;convenient sample&quot; where women fulfilling the inclusion criteria&#xD;
      and consenting to participate in the study will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size justification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include 70 women with symptomatic uterine fibroids who will be randomized into&#xD;
      two groups with 35 women in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The required sample size has been calculated using the PASS 15 Power Anal-ysis and Sample&#xD;
      Size Software (PASS©) version 15 (2017); NCSS, LLC. Kaysville, Utah, USA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main outcome measure is the reduction in fibroid volume. The secondary outcome measures&#xD;
      are symptoms relief and improvement in quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A previous study reported that Ulipristal Acetate (UA) was comparable to uterine artery&#xD;
      embolization (UAE) as regards the percentage of reduction in fibroid volume with median&#xD;
      (interquartile range) percentage reduction of 48.1 (24.8 - 66) % versus 47.3 (29.5 - 69.5) %&#xD;
      for UPA and UAE respectively (Czuczwar et al., 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the methods described by Wan et al (2014) and Luo et al (2018), we calculated that the&#xD;
      mean ± SD percentage of reduction in fibroid volume was 44.0 ± 28.5 % versus 48.9 ±32.3 % for&#xD;
      UPA and UAE respectively, with mean difference of 4.9 % and common within group SD of 30.5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taking into consideration a &quot;drop-out rate&quot; of about 10%, due to loss of follow up or&#xD;
      withdrawal from the study, it is estimated that a sample size of 35 patients per group&#xD;
      achieves 80% power using a one-sided equivalence test with a significance level of 5%&#xD;
      (alpha-error = 0.05), when the difference between the two means is 4.9 %, common within group&#xD;
      SD is 30.5 %, and equivalence limits are -25% and 25%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, this sample size achieves a power of 82% to detect a statistically&#xD;
      significant difference between the two groups as regards the symptoms scores and measures of&#xD;
      ovarian reserve (AFC and AMH) for an effect size equivalent to a Cohen's d of 0.75 (i.e.,&#xD;
      0.75 common SD) using a two-sided unpaired t-test with the same significance level of alpha =&#xD;
      0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These equivalence limits and effect size have been targeted, as they may be considered&#xD;
      clinically important.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The nature and scope of the clinical study will be explained in an understand-able way to the&#xD;
      patients and an informed consent form, in Arabic language, including all the study&#xD;
      procedures, advantages and possible risks and specifying who informed the patient, will be&#xD;
      provided and the patient must sign on it before participation. The study protocol and patient&#xD;
      informed consent will be reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of the Obstetrics and&#xD;
      Gynecology Department, Ain Shams University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Funding:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be funded by the researcher himself and Ain Shams University&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and Allocation concealment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be randomly assigned into one of the two study groups using a computer&#xD;
      random sequence generator. The randomization will be made using sequentially numbered, opaque&#xD;
      sealed envelopes; each envelope contains the method of intervention according to the random&#xD;
      sequence and will be opened just before the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will undergo full assessment before starting either treatment options. This&#xD;
      assessment will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detailed History:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Personal history: including patient's full name, age, marital status, parity, occupation&#xD;
           and residence will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Menstrual history: including age of menarche, D/C, amount of menstrual flow and&#xD;
           associated dysmenorrhea.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Contraceptive history: to exclude other causes for uterine bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Past medical history of Diabetes Mellitus, hypertension, bronchial asthma, cardiac&#xD;
           diseases, anemia, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Past surgical history of uterine surgeries.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  History of present illness with detailed analysis of each patient's complaint whether&#xD;
           abnormal uterine bleeding, dysmenorrhea and pelvic pressure symptoms such as urinary&#xD;
           urgency or constipation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical Examination:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  General examination including: Pulse, blood pressure, temperature, body mass index&#xD;
           (BMI), auscultation of lungs and heart, and complex-ion as pallor due to anemia caused&#xD;
           by heavy bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Abdominal examination: inspection for any scar, palpation of the abdomen for any&#xD;
           tenderness and for pelviabdominal masses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pelvic examination: complete bimanual examination for uterine size, mobility and&#xD;
           palpable uterine fibroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline hemoglobin, hematocrit, and blood grouping.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood chemistry: AST, ALT, serum creatinine and RBS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Trans-vaginal ultrasound for uterine volume and fibroid location, volume and maximum&#xD;
           diameter. Uterine volume (expressed in cubic centimeters) will be calculated by&#xD;
           measuring the maximum length, antero-posterior and transverse diameters of the uterine&#xD;
           corpus, using the US device software formula for calculation of the uterine volume.&#xD;
           Myoma volumes will be measured by using the existing 2-dimensional US methods. The FIGO&#xD;
           classification system (figure 1) will be used for defining the myoma location.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients recruited in this study will be randomized into one of the following study groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Group A &quot;Ulipristal Acetate (UA) - Fibristal group&quot; (n=35):&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients within this group will receive oral Ulipristal Acetate (Fibristal ©) 5 mg / day&#xD;
           starting from the first day of menstrual bleeding, and for 3 months (period of the&#xD;
           study).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Group B &quot;Uterine artery embolization (UAE) group&quot; (n=35):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients within this group will undergo bilateral selective uterine artery embolization,&#xD;
      during which polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) particles will be administered via a catheter followed&#xD;
      by capping with a plug of gelatin sponge. The end point for embolization is to have a static&#xD;
      column of contrast in the uterine artery, with only a stump filling when the internal iliac&#xD;
      artery was injected. The gelatin sponge cap was thought to both complete the occlusion of the&#xD;
      uterine artery and to prevent PVA particles from being drawn out of the uterine artery by the&#xD;
      Venturi effect, which would result in non-target embolization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient within both groups will be subjected to follow-up trans-vaginal ultrasound (US)&#xD;
      3 months after Ulipristal acetate (UA) therapy or after uterine artery embolization (UAE)&#xD;
      session to detect the decline in uterine fibroid volumes in comparison to their baseline. To&#xD;
      reduce inter-observer variability associated with ultrasound imaging, measurements will be&#xD;
      always taken by the same sonographer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient within both groups will be evaluated clinically for the symptoms reported at&#xD;
      least 1 month before starting the treatment (baseline) and 3 months after Ulipristal acetate&#xD;
      (UA) therapy or after uterine artery embolization (UAE) session. Durability of the used&#xD;
      treatment line will be tested by follow up after one year from initiating therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fibroid-related heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) will be evaluated by the pictorial blood&#xD;
      assessment chart score (figure 2). This instrument is a self-administered pictorial chart&#xD;
      that takes account of the number of sanitary pads and tampons used, presence of blood clots,&#xD;
      and episodes of bleeding. The 1-month pictorial blood assessment chart score was calculated&#xD;
      from the addition of daily scores for 28 days. A score of higher than 100 during the first 8&#xD;
      days of menstruation will be defined as heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjective feelings of pelvic pressure, urinary urgency, and constipation will be recorded on&#xD;
      a simplified questionnaire containing 2 categories defined as &quot;absent &quot;and &quot;present.&quot; The&#xD;
      visual analog scale (VAS) pain score (figure 3) will be used to determine the presence or&#xD;
      absence of pelvic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analyzed using Intention to treat (ITT) analysis. According to Fisher et al&#xD;
      (1990), the ITT analysis includes all randomized patients in the groups to which they were&#xD;
      randomly assigned, regardless of their adherence with the entry criteria, regardless of the&#xD;
      treatment they actually received, and regardless of subsequent withdrawal from treatment or&#xD;
      deviation from the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In other words, ITT analysis includes every subject who is randomized according to randomized&#xD;
      treatment assignment. It ignores non-compliance, protocol deviations, withdrawal, and&#xD;
      anything that happens after randomization. ITT analysis is usually described as &quot;once&#xD;
      randomized, always analyzed&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ITT analysis avoids overoptimistic estimates of the efficacy of one of the two interventions&#xD;
      resulting from the removal of non-compliers by accepting that noncompliance and protocol&#xD;
      deviations are likely to occur in actual clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy of the two study interventions will be compared using Odds ratio (OR), Relative risk&#xD;
      (RR), Number needed to treat (NNT) and Number needed to harm (NNH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analyzed using IBM© SPSS© Statistics version 23 (IBM© Corp., Armonk, NY).&#xD;
      Normally distributed numerical data will be presented as mean and SD, and skewed data as&#xD;
      median and interquartile range. Qualitative data will be presented as number and percentage.&#xD;
      Normally distributed numerical data will be compared using the unpaired t test and skewed&#xD;
      data using the Mann-Whitney test. Categorical data will be compared using the Pearson&#xD;
      chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test, if appropriate. A two-sided p-value &lt;0.05 will be&#xD;
      considered statistically significant.&#xD;
