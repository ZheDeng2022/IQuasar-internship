  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative delirium is common in patients with aortic dissection and associated with poor&#xD;
      outcomes. However the pathogenesis of postoperative delirium is poorly understood.&#xD;
      Multichannel electroencephalogram is a recognized tool for identifying neurophysiologic&#xD;
      states during anesthesia, sleep, and arousal. The aim of the current study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      mechanisms and predictors of postoperative delirium in patients with aortic dissection using&#xD;
      electroencephalogram.&#xD;

    <measure>Incidence of postoperative delirium</measure>
    <time_frame>After surgery through to postoperative day 7</time_frame>
    <description>The incidence of postoperative delirium was determined according to the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) diagnostic algorithm. The algorithm consists of four clinical criteria: (1) acute onset and fluctuating course, (2) inattention, (3) disorganized thinking, and (4) altered level of consciousness. To define a patient as having delirium, both the first and the second criteria have to be present, as well as either the third or the fourth criteria. The CAM-ICU will be used for patients who are intubated in the postoperative period.</description>

    <time_frame>During the stay of the patient in the operating room, after surgery through to postoperative day 7</time_frame>
    <description>Electroencephalogram data were acquired using a 32-channel electroencephalogram recording system (Brain Products, Germany). A 5 min, baseline, eyes-closed recording was conducted at the preoperative holding room when the patient was at rest. Recording of electroencephalogram was commenced before the start of anesthetic induction and was stopped before discharge of the patient from the operating room. We defied delta (1 to 3 Hz), theta (4 to 7 Hz), alpha (8 to 12 Hz), and beta (13 to 40 Hz) frequency bands. And then, the relative power of each frequency bands to the total power of the sum is calculated.</description>

    <description>Delirium severity is evaluated both as the peak (highest) and sum Confusion Assessment Method - Severity (CAM-S) score over all hospital days. The CAM-S includes two forms: a Short Form (CAM-S Short Form, based on the 4-item algorithm, the sum of score ranging from 0 to 7, with 7 being the most severe) and a Long Form (CAM-S Long Form, based on the 10-item CAM instrument, the sum of score ranging from 0 to 19, with 19 being the most severe).</description>
