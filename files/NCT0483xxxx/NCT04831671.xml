  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fractures of the tibia (shin bone) are frequently treated with a metal nail that is passed&#xD;
      down the inside of the bone (an intra-medullary nail). This nail is inserted through the top&#xD;
      of the tibia at the level of the knee joint. There are two ways for the nail to be inserted -&#xD;
      either through an incision below the patella (kneecap) or above the patella.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The benefit of the incision above the patella is that it can make it technically easier to&#xD;
      insert the nail into the correct position. However, the perceived risk of damage to the knee&#xD;
      cartilage has prevented this technique from being widely adopted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will use MRI scanning to assess the cartilage for damage using both&#xD;
      techniques. The results will enable the investigators to determine if the theoretical risk of&#xD;
      cartilage damage is found in real-world scenarios and to generate data for further, larger&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Intra-medullary nailing is a common form of treatment for a variety of tibial shaft&#xD;
      fractures. Traditionally this has been done via an infra-patella approach. More recently the&#xD;
      use of a supra-patella approach has become more popular. However, there are concerns that the&#xD;
      supra-patella approach may cause unacceptable damage to the cartilage of the patello-femoral&#xD;
      joint (PFJ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will use a novel MRI technique developed at the University of Cambridge to compare&#xD;
      the amount of damage caused to the knee joint by both infra- and supra-patella nailing&#xD;
      techniques. Specific cartilage assessment sequences will enable a fuller assessment of&#xD;
      cartilage damage than can be achieved with normal structural sequences. Participants will&#xD;
      also be asked to complete Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) regarding their injury to&#xD;
      assess their clinical outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infra-patella and supra-patella nailing techniques are now both routine methods of carrying&#xD;
      out intra-medullary nailing of the tibia. Further evidence is required, however, in order to&#xD;
      fully assess whether one method is superior to the other.&#xD;
