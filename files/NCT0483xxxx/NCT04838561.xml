    <textblock>
      This is a single-centre, mixed-methods, prospective study in pediatric patients with T1D&#xD;
      initiating Control-IQ technology on the Tandem t-slim X2 insulin pump.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine pediatric T1D patients' and their parents' perceptions of the impact of&#xD;
      Control-IQ on their psychosocial functioning and quality of life.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background Information &amp; Rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      The management of type 1 diabetes (T1D) is rapidly evolving to offer technology that aims to&#xD;
      improve metabolic control and decrease the burden of diabetes management. Hybrid-closed loop&#xD;
      systems are at the forefront of this technology. They are comprised of an insulin pump and&#xD;
      continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system that interface in order to automatically adjust&#xD;
      the delivery of basal insulin through the pump, based on CGM data. Insulin boluses for meals&#xD;
      and snacks must still be entered manually by the user.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies of hybrid closed loop systems have primarily focused on clinical trials that show&#xD;
      improved glycemic outcomes.1-3 Few studies have assessed real-world glycemic outcomes or&#xD;
      patient-reported outcomes, and none have focused on a pediatric population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent study published by Pinsker et al.4 showed improvement in psychosocial outcomes and&#xD;
      persistent achievement of glycemic targets in a real-world setting in adults with T1D using&#xD;
      the Tandem t:slim X2 pump with Control-IQ technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Tandem t:slim X2 pump with Control-IQ is a hybrid closed loop system (using Dexcom G6&#xD;
      CGM) that has recently been approved for use by Health Canada, but has been used in the U.S.&#xD;
      for the last year. This new technology will launch in Canada in March 2021, at which time&#xD;
      existing Tandem t:slim X2 insulin pump users (with concurrent CGM use) will be able to&#xD;
      upgrade their insulin pump software to access this technology (following review of an online&#xD;
      module).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario (CHEO), is located in Ottawa, ON Canada. CHEO&#xD;
      follows approximately 800 children with diabetes, approximately 85 of whom are managed on the&#xD;
      Tandem t:slim X2 pump with concurrent Dexcom G6 CGM use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The upcoming launch of Control-IQ presents a unique opportunity to gain a better&#xD;
      understanding of the real-world impact of this technology on our Canadian pediatric&#xD;
      population. The benefits of conducting this study in our population are two-fold:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The Canadian context offers the study a diverse patient population given our universal&#xD;
           healthcare system and provincially-funded insulin pump program. Because pumps and&#xD;
           supplies are funded by the government, they are available to all of our patients,&#xD;
           regardless of socio-economic status and whether or not they have private health&#xD;
           insurance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Studying a pediatric population offers the unique perspective of children and youth (and&#xD;
           their parents) whose management practices and goals differ from those of adults. While&#xD;
           adult patients and parents of children with T1D are motivated by attaining glycemic&#xD;
           targets for long term health outcomes, children and youth live in moment with emphasis&#xD;
           on how they feel now. As such, patient reported outcomes, while important to all ages,&#xD;
           are often the most important motivator for children and youth when choosing a treatment&#xD;
           regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design This is a single-centre, mixed-methods, prospective study in pediatric patients&#xD;
      with T1D initiating Control-IQ technology on the Tandem t-slim X2 insulin pump.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will enroll in the study prior to initiating use of Control-IQ on their Tandem&#xD;
      insulin pump.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment will occur over an eight-week period starting mid-March 2021. Participation in&#xD;
      this study will last 16 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: To determine pediatric T1D patients' and their parents' perceptions of the&#xD;
      impact of Control-IQ on their psychosocial functioning and quality of life (as measured by&#xD;
      the INSPIRE Questionnaire, post assessment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the effect of Control-IQ technology on other patient and parent reported&#xD;
           outcomes (PROs) including:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Diabetes Impact and Device Satisfaction (DIDS) scale,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Hypoglycemia Fear Survey (child and parent version),&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  WHO-5 (emotional well-being)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the impact of Control-IQ technology on glycemic control in pediatric T1D&#xD;
           patients who are experienced sensor-augmented pump users.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To explore the effect of Control-IQ technology on patient and parents' sleep, school,&#xD;
           activities/ sports, mood and family dynamics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To explore whether or not youth and parents' expectations of Control-IQ align with their&#xD;
           experience of using this this automated insulin delivery system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant Characteristics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data will be collected from each chart at baseline:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Date of birth&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gender&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Date of T1D diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Date of initiation of insulin pump therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Date of first insulin pump start&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Date of Tandem t:slim X2 pump start&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Current use of CGM (yes/ no)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Last measured HbA1c ( if available within the last 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of hospitalizations due to diabetes complications within the past year&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sociodemographic measures will be collected by questionnaire at baseline, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Family structure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Parental education - highest level achieved&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Household income&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Private health insurance&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ethnicity (self-reported)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Plan The patient population will be described using descriptive statistics. The&#xD;
      study team will compare patient reported outcomes, measures of glycemic control, and measures&#xD;
      of insulin pump management pre and 16 weeks post-initiation of Control-IQ technology, using&#xD;
      paired t-test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test, depending on the distributional characteristics&#xD;
      of the outcomes. Analysis of open-ended questions will be done by a qualitative research&#xD;
      specialist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Determination CHEO currently has 85 patients on the Tandem t:slim X2 pump with&#xD;
      CGM, with an estimated 10-15 patients more estimated to start before March 2021.&#xD;
      Historically, the patient population at CHEO has been highly engaged with research with an&#xD;
      anticipated participation rate of 90-95%. The Investigator expects that recruitment rates&#xD;
      would be similar for this study, allowing for a sample size of 70 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This sample size is sufficient to provide &gt; 80% power for detecting a &quot;medium size&quot; effect&#xD;
      (Cohen's d = 0.5), which corresponds to a mean score of 70 from the post assessment INSPIRE&#xD;
      Questionnaire, 10 units larger than a mean score of 60 (the null hypothesis). Cohen's d is&#xD;
      expressed by the ratio of the mean difference over the standard deviation. Here, we use sd =&#xD;
      20 as an estimate of the standard deviation of the score, which is conservative considering&#xD;
      previously presented estimates (e.g. sd = 16.44 described in Weissberg-Benchell et al [5]).&#xD;
