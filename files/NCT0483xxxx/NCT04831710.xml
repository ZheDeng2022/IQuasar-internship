  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL) belongs to a subtype of peripheral T-cell lymphoma&#xD;
      (PTCL) and is also a distinct type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). The clinical outcomes of&#xD;
      AITL is poor and optimal treatment strategies for AITL have not been fully defined. Patients&#xD;
      with disseminated or relapsed disease have a very poor outcome, and there is no standard&#xD;
      management for relapsed or refractory disease. Epigenetic drugs have been widely used to&#xD;
      treat patients with refractory/relapse AITL. Several phase II clinical trails demonstrated&#xD;
      the ORR of 33-50% in patients with r/r AITL treated with HDAC inhibitors (including&#xD;
      Belimastat, Romidepsin, Chidamide). HDAC inhibitors are important drugs for the current&#xD;
      treatment of AITL, but still more than half of the patients can not benefit from it.&#xD;
      PD1/PD-L1 blockade was a potent strategy for r/r PTCL in two small sample studies. Current&#xD;
      studies have found that HDACi can upregulate the expression of PDL1, In vivo testing of&#xD;
      C57BL/6 mice revealed a synergistic tumor suppression after combining HDACi and PD-1&#xD;
      blockade. We carried out a single, open-label, multicenter clinical trial enrolled patients&#xD;
      with relapsed/refractory AITL to investigate the safety and efficacy of sintilimab in&#xD;
      combination with chidamide.&#xD;
