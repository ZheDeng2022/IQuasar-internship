    <textblock>
      This is an open-labeled, randomized, two period, single-center, crossover, comparative study,&#xD;
      where each participant will be randomly assigned to the reference (Arcoxia®, 120 mg&#xD;
      film-coated tablets) or the test (Etoricoxib, 120 mg film-coated tablets) formulation in each&#xD;
      period of study (sequences Test-Reference (TR) or Reference-Test (RT)), in order to evaluate&#xD;
      if both formulations are bioequivalent.&#xD;
