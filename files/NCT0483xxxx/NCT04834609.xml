      This study investigated the cellular and molecular characteristics of AT-MSCs obtained from&#xD;
      autologous AT therapy in patients with high transphincteric perianal fistulas of&#xD;
      crytoglandular origin. Adipose tissue was injected into anal fistulas. Characteristics of&#xD;
      adipose tissue mesenchymal stemcells (AT-MSC) was investigated and compared in patients with&#xD;
      fistula that healed after the treatment (responders) to patients who failed to heal&#xD;
      (non-responders)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Injection with allogene or autologous stem cells has been reported to be efficient treatment&#xD;
      of perianal fistulas. An alternative to this treatment could be injection with freshly&#xD;
      collected autologous adipose tissue. In this study 27 patients with cryptoglandular anal&#xD;
      fistulas were treated with freshly collected autologous adipose tissue.A clinical assessment&#xD;
      of the patient prior to inclusion was undertaken and a loose seton placed for at least 6&#xD;
      weeks prior to fat injection. An MRI of the pelvis was performed before inclusion. Fistulas&#xD;
      with secondary tracts and/or cavities were excluded. The operation was performed in one&#xD;
      procedure including liposuction and injection of adipose tissue. A sample of adipose tissue&#xD;
      from all 27 patients was analyzed. AT-MSCs were isolated and characterized using cellular and&#xD;
      molecular analyses. Clinical and MRI-scanning evaluation of fistula healing and evaluation of&#xD;
      ano-rectal function was performed after 6 months. AT-MSCs phenotype was compared between&#xD;
      responders and non-responders with respect to fistula healing. The evaluation of the AT-MSCs&#xD;
      was performed in a blinded manner.&#xD;
