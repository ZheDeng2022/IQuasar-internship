      List experiment to measure food and water insecurity&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Food and water insecurity are complex, multi-domain constructs. Given their known association&#xD;
      with important health and mental health outcomes, accurate assessment of food and water&#xD;
      insecurity in resource-limited settings is paramount. The purpose of this study is to use a&#xD;
      list experiment methodology to assess the extent to which there is bias in conventional&#xD;
      survey-based means of direct elicitation of food and water insecurity. The list experiment&#xD;
      provides an indirect means to measure a particular construct of interest. It is hypothesized&#xD;
      that social desirability may cause upward bias in conventional survey-based means of direct&#xD;
      elicitation of food and water insecurity.&#xD;

    <description>As this is a survey experiment, the &quot;intervention&quot; involves random assignment to a survey questionnaire with specific wording. The first version of the questionnaire includes 6 sets of 3 true-false statements that are innocuous and contextually applicable (e.g., weather, cultural norms) such that there is a low likelihood that the participant will answer untruthfully. The statements on food and water insecurity that are included in the experimental version are omitted.</description>

The second version of the questionnaire includes 6 sets of 4 true-false statements that are innocuous and contextually applicable (e.g., weather, cultural norms) such that there is a low likelihood that the participant will answer untruthfully for 3 of the true-false statements. One statement in each set relates to food and water insecurity and is designed to determine the extent to which social desirability bias may influence responses to food and water insecurity questions.</description>
