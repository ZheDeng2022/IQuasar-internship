  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b/2 study to identify the recommended dose of M7824 for further study with&#xD;
      weekly paclitaxel, and to assess the safety and clinical efficacy of this combined treatment&#xD;
      in advanced gastric cancer after first line treatment. The study will be conducted in two&#xD;
      parts: Part 1 (Phase 1b) dose escalation study to determine the MTD and RP2D of weekly&#xD;
      paclitaxel in combination with fixed dose M7824, Part 2 (Phase 2) to further evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and tolerability of the combination of M7824 and paclitaxel at the RP2D and determine&#xD;
      anti-tumor activity.&#xD;
