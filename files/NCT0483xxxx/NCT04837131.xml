  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to learn about the effects of the medication ixazomib&#xD;
      in participants with scleroderma/systemic sclerosis including its safety and tolerability,&#xD;
      its effects on skin, lungs and other organs, and its effects on overall health and quality of&#xD;
      life.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of oral ixazomib&#xD;
      taken on days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day treatment cycle for 6 cycles in 12 participants&#xD;
      having diffuse systemic sclerosis/scleroderma of less than 5 years duration with non-severe&#xD;
      interstitial lung involvement as identified from chest CT scan completed within the preceding&#xD;
      3 months or at study screening visit. All 12 participants will receive oral ixazomib.&#xD;
      Reflecting the common use of mycophenolate in the management of scleroderma with complicating&#xD;
      interstitial lung disease, 6 of 12 participants who will be enrolled will be already taking&#xD;
      mycophenolate at a stable dose for the preceding 3 months and will be allowed to continue&#xD;
      taking mycophenolate throughout the entire study prescribed as routine care. Ixazomib will be&#xD;
      added to their medications. The remaining 6 of 12 participants meeting the same eligibility&#xD;
      criteria will not be using mycophenolate or any other treatment for scleroderma interstitial&#xD;
      lung disease at the time of enrollment and will subsequently take ixazomib study medication&#xD;
      during participation in this study. Ixazomib dose modification or interruption is allowed for&#xD;
      safety and tolerability reasons at any time during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective of this study is to assess the effect of ixazomib on scleroderma skin&#xD;
      tightness/thickening and its effect on scleroderma interstitial lung disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study includes approximately 13 clinic visits over up to approximately 10 months. Study&#xD;
      procedures include medical examinations, blood tests, chest CT scans, pulmonary function&#xD;
      tests, echocardiogram, EKG, skin biopsies, and questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no cost for participation in this study.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in the UCLA Scleroderma Clinical Trials Consortium Gastrointestinal 2.0 (UCLA SCTC GIT 2.0) questionnaire score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Each subsequent study visit every 28 days for approximately 7 months</time_frame>
    <description>The UCLA SCTC GIT 2.0 is a self-administered survey consisting of 34 questions (Reflux 1 to 8, Distention/Bloating 9 to 12, Fecal Soilage 13, Diarrhea 14 to 15, Social functioning 16 to 21, Emotional well-being 22 to 30, Constipation 31 to 34). The items are scored on a scale from 0 to 3, where 0 indicates better health and 3 indicates worse health, except for questions 15 and 31, which are scored as 0 (better health) and 1 (worse health). Scores from all scales except the constipation scale are averaged to form a total GIT score from 0 (no gastrointestinal problems) to 3 (most severe) that captures overall burden of severity of scleroderma-associated gastrointestinal involvement.&#xD;
Scores will be summarized descriptively.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in Modified Rodnan Skin Score (MRSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks, 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>MRSS is a validated clinical semiquantitative assessment of scleroderma skin thickness at 17 prespecified sites on the body, with thickness at each site scored from 0 (uninvolved) to 3 (severe thickening) that are tabulated for a total numerical skin score ranging 0-51. MRSS correlates with internal organ involvement, disease severity, and mortality and is used as outcome measure in clinical trials.&#xD;
Change of MRSS from baseline at week 12 and week 24 are summarized descriptively without imputation for missing values.</description>

    <measure>Severity of dyspnea at baseline (Mahler Baseline Dyspnea Index)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Severity of dyspnea at baseline is measured with the Mahler Baseline Dyspnea Index (BDI). BDI includes 5 grades of severity from 0 (severe impairment) to 4 (no impairment ) for each of 3 categories (functional impairment; magnitude of task; magnitude of effort) yielding a summation focal score (0-12). BDI focal scores are summarized descriptively without imputation for missing values.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dyspnea Status Rating (Mahler Transitional Dyspnea Index)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks, 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Mahler Transitional Dyspnea Index (TDI) rates a participant's dyspnea status relative to baseline. TDI scores range from -3 (major deterioration) to +3 (major improvement) including 0 to indicate no change in status for each of the 3 BDI categories (functional impairment; magnitude of task; magnitude of effort) yielding a summation focal score (-9 to +9). Provision is made for &quot;Z&quot; score if further impairment occurs for reasons other than dyspnea. TDI focal scores are summarized descriptively without imputation for missing values.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Scleroderma Health Assessment Questionnaire (SHAQ) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks, 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>SHAQ self-assesses function in 8 domains of the Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI): dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and activities. Highest domain scores 0 (no difficulty) to 3 (unable to do) are summed and divided by 8 to yield Disability Index score as a continuous variable ranging 0 to 3.&#xD;
SHAQ has:1) a 15-cm Visual Analog Scale (VAS) rating pain with anchors &quot;No Pain&quot; and &quot;Very Severe Pain&quot;; 2) four 15-cm VAS assessing Raynaud phenomenon, digital ulcers, gastrointestinal and lung symptoms with anchors &quot;Does Not Interfere&quot; and &quot;Very Severe Limitation&quot;; and 3) overall disease severity 15-cm VAS with anchors &quot;No Disease&quot; and &quot;Very Severe Disease&quot;&#xD;
Each VAS scale is converted to a continuous variable (1 cm on VAS = 0.2 points) ranging 0 to 3 which will be summarized descriptively.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Patient Global Assessment of Disease Activity (PtGA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks, 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patient-reported outcome that represents the participant's assessment of his or her current overall health (Question: How was your overall health in the last week?) rated on an 11-point numeric scale anchored at 0 (excellent) to 10 (extremely poor) with higher scores indicating worse disease in terms of severity and damage.&#xD;
Scores will be summarized descriptively.</description>

    <measure>Change in Physician Global Assessment of Disease Activity (MDGA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks, 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Physician-reported outcome that represents an assessment of the participant's current overall health rated on an 11-point numeric scale anchored at 0 (excellent) to 10 (extremely poor) with higher scores indicating worse disease in terms of severity and damage.&#xD;
Scores will be summarized descriptively.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in American College of Rheumatology Composite Response Index for clinical trials in early diffuse cutaneous Systemic Sclerosis (ACR CRISS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks, 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>ACR CRISS calculates the predicted probability of improvement in a 2-step process.&#xD;
Four possible outcomes in Step 1 include worsening of FVC % predicted by at least 15%, new decline of left ventricular ejection fraction to 45% or less attributable to scleroderma and needing treatment, new onset pulmonary arterial hypertension attributable to scleroderma and scleroderma renal crisis. If any one of these outcomes develops as a change from baseline, the participant is classified as not improved (score = 0) regardless of changes in other parameters. The outcome and score are summarized descriptively.&#xD;
Step 2 calculates change from baseline in the predicted probability of improvement based on combined changes in the mRSS, FVC % predicted, patient global assessment, physician global assessment, and HAQ-DI. The calculated probability ranges from 0 (not improved) to 1.0 where a higher score indicates improvement. Step 2 calculated probability scores are summarized descriptively.</description>
