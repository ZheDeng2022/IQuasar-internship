    <textblock>
      This study aimis at detecting the genomic changes of ctDNA in patients of RAS and BRAF&#xD;
      wild-type mCRC, who failed after first line treatment containing cetuximab. According to the&#xD;
      results of ctDNA detection, individualized second-line targeted therapy strategies were&#xD;
      developed to explore the disease control rate and prognostic significance of ctDNA-guided&#xD;
      treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer.&#xD;

    <description>After PD, patients received ctDNA testing, and different research protocols were selected according to different gene states of ctDNA, as follows: 1.No secondary changes related to drug resistance were found. Cetuximab cross-line + second-line chemotherapy (FOLFOX/FOLFIRI/ Irinotecan monotherapy, etc.) was used.2. If there is a RAS secondary mutation, change of beacizumab bead sheet resistance + second-line chemotherapy (FOLFOX/XELOX/stand for kang single-agent FOLFIRI mXEIRI/Iraq, etc.);3. If BRAF secondary mutation occurs, replace it with vimofenib + cetuximab + irinotecan;4. If HER2 amplification occurs, replace it with trastuzumab + lapatinib or trastuzumab + pertuzumab;5. In case of other secondary mutations, bevacizumab plus second-line chemotherapy should be replaced.</description>
