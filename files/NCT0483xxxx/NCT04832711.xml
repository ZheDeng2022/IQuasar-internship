  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We aimed to investigate the relationship between obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) risk and&#xD;
      respiratory inflammation evaluated by the exhaled breath condensate （EBC）interleukin-6 IL-6&#xD;
      and plasma SP-D, based on the Berlin questionnaire (BQ) screening values in an adult, urban&#xD;
      community in Beijing, China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers aged &gt;40 years were recruited from the Shichahai community of central Beijing.&#xD;
      Their general information and disease history were recorded. OSA risk was assessed using the&#xD;
      BQ. IL-6 in EBC and plasma SP-D were detected by enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA)through&#xD;
      specimens collected on fasting. The differences in IL-6 and SP-D contents between high-risk&#xD;
      and low-risk groups for OSA were compared, and the factors affecting their contents were&#xD;
      analyzed.&#xD;

      Subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      The volunteers were recruited residents from the Shi Cha Hai community of Beijing, China. The&#xD;
      inclusion criteria included individuals aged ≥40 years who had stayed in the community for at&#xD;
      least 3 years and who had provided informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In contrast, the exclusion criteria were patients with known severe diseases who could not&#xD;
      cooperate with the study, such as severe psychiatric diseases, chronic liver disease, heart&#xD;
      failure, autoimmune disease, and chronic kidney disease; a history of pulmonary lobectomy or&#xD;
      lung transplantation; and drug abuse or alcohol addiction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaire survey and physical examination Community volunteers were surveyed for general&#xD;
      information (name, sex, age, height, weight, etc.), history of previous common diseases,&#xD;
      medication use, history of smoking, history of alcohol consumption, and occupation. All&#xD;
      surveys were filled in the case report form of the study. A Chinese translation of the BQ was&#xD;
      used to classify participants as high risk and low risk for OSA. COPD were diagnosed by a&#xD;
      portable spirometer (Vitalograph copd-6). Other investigated diseases were self-reported by&#xD;
      participants based on previous diagnosis. Physical examination included blood pressure,&#xD;
      height, and weight measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample collection and storage Venous blood and EBC were collected between 9 AM and 12 AM&#xD;
      after fasting for &gt;10 hours. The plasma collected in EDTA anticoagulated blood collection&#xD;
      tubes was separated by centrifugation at 2,000 g for 15 min and stored at -80℃. The EBC&#xD;
      collection was performed using an EBC collector (model number, EBC-5; patent number, ZL 2019&#xD;
      2 1297152.7, China).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EBC collection was conducted as follows: After resting for 15 minutes and cleaning the&#xD;
      oral cavity with water, participants were instructed to wear a nose clip and breathe calmly&#xD;
      through a mouthpiece with a one-way valve, which was connected to an electrical condenser.&#xD;
      Participants were asked to breathe through the device for 15 minutes to obtain between 0.5&#xD;
      and 1.5 ml of condensate. After being pre-processed with argon flow of 0.25 L/min for 10&#xD;
      minutes, the condensate was immediately fractional packed and transferred to special tubes&#xD;
      and stored at -80℃. EBC equipment, collection procedures, and preservation complied with&#xD;
      European Respiratory Society standards on breath analyses .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of biomarkers Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits were used to measure&#xD;
      the biomarkers in both EBC and plasma.&#xD;
