    <textblock>
      This prospective non-interventional study is intended to generate new data and insights into&#xD;
      first-line (1L) treatment of newly diagnosed advanced high-grade epithelial Ovarian cancer&#xD;
      (OC) in Germany relevant for patients, physicians and payers. It will capture the influence&#xD;
      of 1L Poly ADP ribose polymerase inhibitor (PARPi) maintenance treatment (MTX) on medical&#xD;
      routine in Germany, especially on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  outcome of the 3-steps 1L treatment phase (including surgery, Chemotherapy (CTX) and&#xD;
           MTX) including the potential of patients with primary advanced OC to be cured,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  patient's follow-up (FU) during and after MTX therapy,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  patient-reported outcomes (PROs), experiences and needs,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  physician's experience,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BRCA/HRD and genomic scar testing behavior at diagnosis/during 1L therapy,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  patient selection for different 1L systemic treatment approaches,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  use and safety of drugs,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  treatment sequence in case of recurrence&#xD;
