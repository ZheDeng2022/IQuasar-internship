  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1 pilot study to assess feasibility and acceptability and potential for&#xD;
      impact of a gender-enhanced virtual group workshop focused on oral Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis&#xD;
      (PrEP) as an HIV prevention method for young South African women. It was developed in&#xD;
      collaboration with South African adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) aged 18-25. The&#xD;
      investigators will compare AGYW (N=98) assigned to the virtual group-based (GE) workshop to&#xD;
      those assigned to an Individually Accessed (IA) condition in which women are given access to&#xD;
      a PrEP video and to websites that provide information on PrEP and on contraception options.&#xD;
      Investigators also are evaluating the acceptability and feasibility of peer-driven&#xD;
      recruitment (PDR). AGYW assigned to either intervention condition will be invited to become&#xD;
      Peer Health Advocates (PHAs), who are incentivized to talk to social network members and&#xD;
      refer up to three to the intervention type the PHA attended. The aim is to assess if PDR is&#xD;
      self-sustaining and is effective at reaching women who might not be reached in clinics.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      South African adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) remain at extraordinarily high risk of&#xD;
      HIV infection. Oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has the potential to alter the epidemic&#xD;
      in this vulnerable population, given that it is has been shown that if it is adhered to, oral&#xD;
      PrEP can protect women from HIV infection. Yet, a critical question is whether AGYW will&#xD;
      adopt and adhere to oral PrEP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose that two innovations can reach young, at-risk AGYW, inform them&#xD;
      about PrEP and motivate them to use it: (1) introducing PrEP through a gender lens in a group&#xD;
      workshop; and (2) peer-driven recruitment-recruiting women to attend the workshop by those&#xD;
      who have already attended it. To inform intervention development, the investigators conducted&#xD;
      six focus groups with at-risk AGYW (aged 18-25), 8 qualitative interviews with focus group&#xD;
      participants, and 20 qualitative interviews with men (10 HIV-positive, 10 HIV-negative or of&#xD;
      unknown status) partnered with women in this age range that explored knowledge of, beliefs&#xD;
      about, motivators for, and concerns about using PrEP in the context of gendered relationship&#xD;
      dynamics and PrEP-related stigma. Guided by gender theory and the Information Motivation&#xD;
      Behavior (IMB) model, and in collaboration with a Working Group of AGYW, a virtual (online)&#xD;
      group-based Gender-Enhanced (GE) Workshop (using the WhatsApp® platform) was developed. The&#xD;
      intervention has components that are conducted by participants on their own time as well as a&#xD;
      &quot;real-time&quot; &quot;live&quot; interactive session and aims to provide PrEP information and address&#xD;
      AGYW's barriers to using it. The goal of the intervention is to promote consideration of and&#xD;
      uptake of PrEP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this phase 1 pilot study to assess feasibility and acceptability and potential for impact&#xD;
      of the workshop, investigators will compare AGYW (N=98) assigned to the virtual group-based&#xD;
      (GE) workshop or to an Individually Accessed (IA) condition in which women are given access&#xD;
      to a PrEP video and to websites that provide information on PrEP and on contraception&#xD;
      options. To evaluate Peer-driven recruitment (PDR), AGYW randomized to either condition will&#xD;
      be invited to become Peer Health Advocates (PHAs), who are incentivized to talk to social&#xD;
      network members and refer up to three to the workshop type the PHA attended. Acceptability&#xD;
      and feasibility of PDR will be evaluated by assessing whether the method can be&#xD;
      self-sustaining (i.e., on average &gt;50% attendees become PHAs and &gt;2 recruitees/PHA attend a&#xD;
      workshop); and whether it reaches high-risk women and women who would not be captured by&#xD;
      other methods of recruitment (percent who score high on HIV risk; percent who never tested or&#xD;
      attended family planning). If promising, these approaches will be further tested in a larger&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
