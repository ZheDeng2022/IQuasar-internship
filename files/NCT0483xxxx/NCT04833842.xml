      In the three-month study, a web-based childbirth preparation program will be applied to&#xD;
      primigravida women in the initiative group, based on the Health Belief Model and supported by&#xD;
      motivational interviews. Training will take five weeks. Beginning from the 30th week of&#xD;
      pregnancy, pregnant women will be asked to read the first part of the website and a suitable&#xD;
      time will be determined for a motivational interview by calling the phone within that week.&#xD;
      All applications of pregnant women related to the website will be evaluated. At the specified&#xD;
      time, pregnant women will be taken to motivational interview training based on the Health&#xD;
      Belief Model and the trainings will be carried out individually and online. A web-based birth&#xD;
      preparation program based on the Health Belief Model will be applied to primigravida women in&#xD;
      the control group. Training will take five weeks. Beginning from the 30th week of pregnancy,&#xD;
      pregnant women will be asked to read the first part of the website. All applications of&#xD;
      pregnant women related to the website will be evaluated.&#xD;
