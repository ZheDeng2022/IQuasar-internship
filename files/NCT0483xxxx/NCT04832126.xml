    <textblock>
      several genes have been associated with ion channel diseases, but a large number of families&#xD;
      do not yet have an identified genetic cause. There is a lack of information on the genetic&#xD;
      characteristics of channelopathies in Brazilians affected by these diseases. This study aims&#xD;
      to carry out a comprehensive genetic analysis of cardiac channelopathies in Brazilian&#xD;
      patients and their families. The study will involve 20 patients and 80 family members (a&#xD;
      total of 100 individuals) accompanied by the Rede D'Or arrhythmia group in Rio de Janeiro.&#xD;
      Individuals will be recruited and subjected to DNA sequencing and phenotypic evaluation,&#xD;
      including clinical evaluation, echocardiography, 24-hour Holter or longer&#xD;
      electrocardiographic monitoring. An integrated analysis of phenotype-genotype will be made in&#xD;
      all individuals included in the study. Patients and their families will be followed up&#xD;
      annually for 2 to 5 years through clinical evaluations and the same complementary methods&#xD;
      described. The DNA sequencing of patients and their families may contribute to improve the&#xD;
      diagnosis of channelopathies and allow the determination of the pattern of occurrence of the&#xD;
      disease in the cases involved. Besides, this study may lead to the discovery of new genetic&#xD;
      variants associated with channelopathies that will serve as a basis for designing and&#xD;
      carrying out broader molecular epidemiological studies. The study of the molecular genetics&#xD;
      of channelopathies is important mainly so that patients can avoid sudden death, but also for&#xD;
      the medical community, researchers, laboratories, companies involved in the production of&#xD;
      medical devices, and public health authorities&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Inherited arrhythmias are characterized by variable expressiveness and incomplete penetrance.&#xD;
      Extensive genotype-phenotype studies are needed to elucidate the genetic basis of these&#xD;
      diseases. There are several reasons for studying the molecular genetics of channelopathies,&#xD;
      such as determining the molecular epidemiology of these diseases, offering evidence for a&#xD;
      better understanding of the molecular basis of diseases, determining the genetic patterns of&#xD;
      occurrence (inherited or again), and improving the diagnosis and genetic counseling. Besides,&#xD;
      the genetic study of these diseases can lead to the discovery of new genetic variants&#xD;
      associated with these diseases and to the creation of experimental models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genetic testing is recommended (Class I) for any patient with a strong clinical suspicion of&#xD;
      genetically inherited channelopathies including long QT syndrome, catecholaminergic&#xD;
      polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, Brugada syndrome, and short QT syndrome. Specific&#xD;
      genetic testing for the mutation identified in the index case is also recommended (Class I)&#xD;
      for family members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The molecular genetics of cardiac channelopathies has been extensively studied in populations&#xD;
      in developed countries. In the past, the most frequently used methods were the sequencing of&#xD;
      a single or a few suspect genes. More recently, wider panels or even the sequencing of the&#xD;
      complete exome have been increasingly used. This procedure has allowed the discovery of an&#xD;
      increasing number of genetic variants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the genetic basis for many cases of these diseases is known, many families do not&#xD;
      yet have a definite genetic cause. Besides, it is difficult to predict the pathogenicity and&#xD;
      clinical evolution of individual mutations. Recent advances in the generation of induced&#xD;
      pluripotent stem cells (iPS) may allow considerable progress in the translational research of&#xD;
      arrhythmias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the discovery of the first channelopathy in 1995 , the use of genetic tests for&#xD;
      diagnostic and prognostic purposes has evolved considerably and is now being used in clinical&#xD;
      practice and not just for research purposes. Despite all these advances, the use of DNA&#xD;
      sequencing to determine the presence or absence of some diseases is a challenge, since all&#xD;
      these clinical syndromes can be associated with different mutations, many of which have not&#xD;
      yet been described. The genetic sequencing of patients with genetically inherited arrhythmias&#xD;
      is essential not only to provide clinical information related to well-characterized mutations&#xD;
      but also to contribute to the discovery of new genetic alterations. In Brugada syndrome, for&#xD;
      example, although 12 genotypes have been described so far, genetic changes have been&#xD;
      identified in only 30% of cases. The reason for these discrepancies is related to still&#xD;
      incomplete knowledge of all the pathways involved in the function and regulation of cardiac&#xD;
      ion channels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brief descriptions of the most studied channelopathies are presented below. Long QT syndrome&#xD;
      (LQTS) This disease has been identified in different areas of the world, in different ethnic&#xD;
      groups. Although at least 13 forms of the disease have been described so far, the cause in&#xD;
      approximately 20% of cases is not yet defined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The disease is characterized by a prolongation of the QT interval and arrhythmic events. The&#xD;
      arrhythmias usually found in these patients are episodes of polymorphic ventricular&#xD;
      tachycardia (torsades de pointes) that causes dizziness and syncope and may progress to&#xD;
      ventricular fibrillation and sudden death. Individuals affected by LQTS are more susceptible&#xD;
      to atrial fibrillation than the general population This being the most studied channelopathy,&#xD;
      the correlation between genetic variants and clinical evolution is very high. Currently, it&#xD;
      is known that exercise and emotional stress trigger arrhythmias in patients with LQT1 and&#xD;
      that patients with LQT3 usually have episodes of arrhythmia during sleep. It is also known&#xD;
      that LQT8 is extremely aggressive with symptoms appearing early and a poor response to&#xD;
      treatment. At least 20% of genetically proven LQTS cases have normal ECG. For all these&#xD;
      reasons, LQTS is an example of how genetic characterization can help in understanding the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of a clinical condition and improve treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brugada Syndrome (BRS) This clinical syndrome is characterized by spontaneous episodes of&#xD;
      polymorphic ventricular tachycardia that can degenerate into ventricular fibrillation and a&#xD;
      typical electrocardiographic pattern of elevation of the ST segment from V1 to V3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalence of this disease is higher in Asia where, in some locations, it is considered&#xD;
      the most common cause of natural death among men under 50 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The syndrome usually begins in adulthood, being rare in children. Several genotypes have&#xD;
      already been described, typically involving a decrease in the currents of sodium (Na) or an&#xD;
      increase in the currents of potassium (K). The pattern of inheritance is autosomal dominant,&#xD;
      so half of the family members are expected to be affected. As mentioned earlier for LQTS, the&#xD;
      molecular genetics of several cases with clinical criteria for Brugada syndrome has not yet&#xD;
      been elucidated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment of choice is the implantation of a defibrillator. No pharmacological treatment&#xD;
      is safe, although isoproterenol or quinidine can be used in cases of electrical storms.&#xD;
      Ablation is being investigated to control some of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis is made from the electrocardiogram (ECG) with a typical pattern associated with&#xD;
      the clinical evidence of the disease. Occasionally a provocative drug test may be necessary,&#xD;
      as the typical pattern may be transient. Blockers of Na channels such as ajmaline can help to&#xD;
      identify these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia (CPVT) This disease is characterized by&#xD;
      arrhythmic events of bidirectional or polymorphic ventricular tachycardia triggered by an&#xD;
      adrenergic stimulus. Baseline ECG and imaging tests are nonspecific. Ventricular arrhythmias&#xD;
      are observed exclusively during efforts so that the stress test and the Holter are important&#xD;
      diagnostic methods. Two types of mutations have been described so far. One at the ryanodine&#xD;
      receptor and the other at the gene encoding calsequestrin. Only 60% of diagnosed individuals&#xD;
      carry one of these mutations and, therefore, other genes must be involved. Other conditions&#xD;
      Several other arrhythmic genetic syndromes have been described, such as short QT syndrome,&#xD;
      sudden unexplained death syndrome, idiopathic ventricular fibrillation, early repolarization,&#xD;
      and some genetic forms of atrial fibrillation. Many patients are diagnosed after an episode&#xD;
      of sudden aborted death. Better genetic categorization of these cases could help to better&#xD;
      understand the mechanisms involved in these diseases and improve treatment. Family screening&#xD;
      and adequate genetic counseling are essential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES PRIMARY OBJECTIVE This study aims to carry out a comprehensive genetic analysis of&#xD;
      cardiac channelopathies in Brazilian patients and their families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES Discover new genetic variants that are causal or associated with&#xD;
      arrhythmias. Determine the molecular epidemiology of these diseases. Find evidence for a&#xD;
      better understanding of the molecular basis of these diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allow the creation of experimental models. Determine the genetic patterns of occurrence&#xD;
      (inherited or new, among others). Allow an improvement in the diagnosis. Enable an&#xD;
      improvement in genetic counseling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESES Genetic analysis will improve the diagnosis and genetic counseling of patients and&#xD;
      their families. Early diagnosis can prevent sudden death in some cases. There is a&#xD;
      possibility to detect new genetic variants associated with channelopathies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS STUDY DESIGN AND POPULATION 20 patients and 80 family members (a total of 100&#xD;
      individuals) accompanied by the arrhythmia group of Rede D'Or will be recruited. The total&#xD;
      number of individuals to include in the study refers to a convenience sample based on&#xD;
      patients currently followed by the group of specialists from Rede D'Or who are part of the&#xD;
      study and their families. The choice of up to 4 family members per proband is justified by&#xD;
      the fact that this number of related individuals is, in most cases, sufficient to determine&#xD;
      the pattern of occurrence and segregation of phenotypes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specification of the family members of each proband that will be included will be made on&#xD;
      a case-by-case basis depending on the pattern of genetic inheritance, the family composition,&#xD;
      and the availability of samples from other family members. The inheritance pattern of causal&#xD;
      genetic variants or those associated with phenotypes jointly defined as cardiac&#xD;
      channelopathies is, more commonly, autosomal dominant. In this context, the genetic testing&#xD;
      of both parents and, whenever possible, of first-degree relatives affected or not by the&#xD;
      phenotype is sufficient for the establishment or exclusion of causality. Although less&#xD;
      common, sporadic cases can also be seen. In such cases, the pathogenic genetic variant should&#xD;
      not be detected in the parents but testing them is necessary to confirm the sporadic pattern.&#xD;
      In these cases, siblings and/or first-degree relatives should only be tested in the absence&#xD;
      of the parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pilot study that will provide information on the population affected by these&#xD;
      diseases in our country. All eligible patients, affected by channelopathies and followed up&#xD;
      in hospitals and clinics belonging to Rede D'Or São Luiz in Rio de Janeiro and selected&#xD;
      family members, will be invited to participate in the study. DNA sequencing will be performed&#xD;
      3 ± 2 months after inclusion. The phenotypic analysis will be performed 2 ± 1 months after&#xD;
      inclusion and will consist of a clinical evaluation, echocardiography, 24-hour Holter, or&#xD;
      prolonged electrocardiographic monitoring (data collection form - Appendix B). A complete and&#xD;
      integrated genotype-phenotype analysis of the cases included will be performed. Patients and&#xD;
      their families will be followed for a minimum of 2 years and a maximum of 5 years and they&#xD;
      will be evaluated annually with clinical consultations and with the same complementary&#xD;
      methods described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROCEDURES Collection and purification of DNA samples Genomic DNA will be purified from&#xD;
      peripheral blood or mouth swabs. Whole blood will be collected by peripheral phlebotomy in&#xD;
      tubes containing K2EDTA as an anticoagulant. Blood samples will be stored at 4-8 oC for up to&#xD;
      a week before DNA purification. Mouth swabs will be collected using the ORAcollect • DNA kit&#xD;
      (OCR-100) (DNA Genotek Inc., Canada). Genomic DNA from whole blood or mouth swab samples will&#xD;
      be purified using DNeasy Blood &amp; Tissue Kit (QIAGEN).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis of germline genetic variants (inherited or de novo) through DNA sequencing,&#xD;
      either by the Sanger method or by new generation sequencing, is not influenced by the tissue&#xD;
      or body fluid from which the DNA is purified. Therefore, peripheral blood or oral&#xD;
      smears/saliva can be used as a source of DNA without any technical compromise or introduction&#xD;
      of bias. Thus, the choice of blood or oral swab will be determined essentially by the comfort&#xD;
      and convenience for the research participant and aiming at the rational use of the available&#xD;
      resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DNA quantification and quality control The purified genomic DNA will be quantified by&#xD;
      ultraviolet spectrophotometry using the NanoDrop microvolume spectrophotometer (ThermoFisher&#xD;
      Scientific). DNA integrity will be measured by agarose gel electrophoresis and using the&#xD;
      Agilent 4200 TapeStation system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genetic analysis strategy In the initial discovery phase, 20 probands will be selected for&#xD;
      analysis of sequence and copy number variants within a panel of selected candidate genes. The&#xD;
      suspicious causal variables identified in this initial phase will later be analyzed in up to&#xD;
      4 family members or first-degree relatives for each proband.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genetic panel and gene selection criteria Candidate genes included in the panel were selected&#xD;
      from searches in the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database, by reviewing the&#xD;
      literature and consensus, recommendations, and guidelines issued by panels and specialist&#xD;
      societies. The final list of candidate genes was established to include clinically&#xD;
      informative genes, i.e., which assist in diagnostic or therapeutic decisions, and&#xD;
      experimental evidence indicative of genetic involvement in the pathophysiology of&#xD;
      arrhythmias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New generation sequencing Candidate genes will be analyzed for the detection of sequence and&#xD;
      copy number variants using new generation sequencing. The entire coding region and&#xD;
      intron-exon boundaries will be sequenced using Ampliseq ™ technology. The oligonucleotides&#xD;
      for the amplification of the regions of interest will be designed using the online tool Ion&#xD;
      AmpliSeq Designer. The sequencing libraries will be generated using the Ion AmpliSeq ™&#xD;
      Library Kit on the Ion OneTouch 2 System (ThermoFisher Scientific). The sequencing will be&#xD;
      performed on an Ion Personal Genome Machine (PGM) sequencer using the Ion 318 ™ Chip v2 BC&#xD;
      and the Ion PGM ™ Hi-Q ™ View Sequencing reagents (ThermoFisher Scientific). Sequencing&#xD;
      analysis will be performed using the Ion Reporter ™ software (ThermoFisher Scientific).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interpretation and reporting of sequence variants. The interpretation and registration of&#xD;
      sequence variants will be performed according to the consensual recommendation of the&#xD;
      American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics, the Association for Molecular Pathology,&#xD;
      and the College of American Pathologists. Briefly, to describe variants identified in genes&#xD;
      that cause Mendelian disorders, this consensus recommends the use of standard terms:&#xD;
      pathogenic, probably pathogenic, uncertain meaning, likely benign and benign. According to&#xD;
      this recommendation, the process of classifying variants in these five categories is based on&#xD;
      a series of different types of evidence, such as population data, computer simulations,&#xD;
      functional data, and genetic segregation data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation of the pathogenicity of the genetic variants that are detected will be done&#xD;
      independently, i.e., &quot;blind&quot;, by the specialists. The clinical evaluation of the patients and&#xD;
      determination of the phenotype will be carried out by the arrhythmia specialists in the group&#xD;
      under the supervision of Dr. Nilson Araújo. The genetic evaluation will be done in a 'blind'&#xD;
      way by Dr. Marcelo Reis. In case of divergence between the variant found and the phenotype,&#xD;
      the findings will be reviewed by Dr. Luciana Sacilotto (specialist in arrhythmia with&#xD;
      experience in clinical genetics) and by Dr. Carolina Bustamante (specialist in molecular&#xD;
      genetics).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Computational prediction of the functional effect of genetic variants To estimate the&#xD;
      functional effects of the sequence variants, a series of publicly available tools will be&#xD;
      used. These algorithms consider the evolutionary conservation of amino acid residues and&#xD;
      conserved protein domains, protein structure and function, Hiden Markov models, and&#xD;
      position-dependent logic. Whenever available, functional experimental data in vitro on the&#xD;
      effect of specific sequence variants will also be considered for interpretation.&#xD;
