      This study aims to explore the health benefits of air purifier on the impact of air&#xD;
      pollutants on children's health.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      From April 2021 to November 2021, researchers conduct a randomized double-blind crossover&#xD;
      trial on 110 healthy children in Jiaozuo City, Henan Province. The children are divided into&#xD;
      two groups according to their classes and alternated the use of true or sham purifiers&#xD;
      devices, including air purifiers and fresh air system. Air purifiers are installed in the&#xD;
      classroom and bedrooms of the children. Fresh air system are installed in the classroom. A&#xD;
      total of 6 epidemiological surveys are conducted on the subjects, with an interval of 60 days&#xD;
      or more. All participants and research staffs were blinded to the group assignment. In&#xD;
      addition, air pollutant exposure monitoring, questionnaire surveys, physical examinations,&#xD;
      and biological sample collection are conducted on the research subjects each time. The&#xD;
      biological samples are further tested for the concentration levels of related biomarkers such&#xD;
      as the respiratory system, cardiovascular system, metabolic system, and nervous system.&#xD;
      Furthermore, comprehensive evaluation of children's behavioral ability is also carried out.&#xD;

    <measure>Changes of Forced Vital Capacity of Lung Function</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at the end of each 60 days intervention period</time_frame>
    <description>The pulmonary function measures are performed by the professional medical staff. Before the pulmonary function test, subjects practice several times by themselves. During the examination, each subject stand and clamp the nose clip, and repeat the test, with the best result as the criterion.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes of FeNO</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at the end of each 60 days intervention period</time_frame>
    <description>Use NIOX VERO Sensor to measure fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) as a biomarker for formaldehyde inhalation exposure. After deep breathing, the subjects gently inhaled into the device. The instrument showed FeNO level of the subjects.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes of FeCO</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at the end of each 60 days intervention period</time_frame>
    <description>Use Pico Smokerlyzer to measure fractional exhaled carbon monoxide (FeCO). After deep breathing, the subjects held their breath for 15 seconds and then gently inhaled into the device. The instrument showed FeCO level and the estimated value of carboxyhemoglobin in blood.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes of Systolic Blood Pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at the end of each 60 days intervention period</time_frame>
    <description>Systolic blood pressure for each subject is conducted by the same trained staff using the same instrument. Average levels are calculated by the treatments of intervention or control.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes of LF/HF of HRV</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at the end of each 60 days intervention period</time_frame>
    <description>Use Nihon Kohden Electrocardiograph to measure heart rate variability and examine the ratio between low frequency and high frequency (LF/HF). To eliminate possible error, subjects are conducted by the same trained staff using the same instrument.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes of CRP</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at the end of each 60 days intervention period</time_frame>
    <description>Detect the concentration of C-reactive protein in blood sample to examine the different level of inflammation between the group of intervention and control.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes of 8-OHdG</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at the end of each 60 days intervention period</time_frame>
    <description>Detect the concentration of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) in urine sample as a marker of generalized, cellular oxidative stress to DNA.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes of PR</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at the end of each 60 days intervention period</time_frame>
    <description>Examine persistent response (PR) as the index to test the focus ability of children. The test is performed by the Wsiconsin card sorting test through computer, and the index reflects the ability of cognitive transfer. The normal value is less than or equal to 27.</description>
