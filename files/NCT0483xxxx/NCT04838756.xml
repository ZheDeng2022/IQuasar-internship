  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to assess whether AI can improve the&#xD;
      efficacy of mammography screening, by adapting single and double reading based on AI derived&#xD;
      cancer-risk scores and to use AI as a decision support in the screen reading, compared with&#xD;
      conventional mammography screening (double reading without AI).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      European guidelines recommend that mammography exams in breast cancer screening are read by&#xD;
      two breast radiologists to ensure a high sensitivity. Double reading is, however, resource&#xD;
      demanding and still results in missed cancers. Computer-aided detection based on AI has been&#xD;
      shown to have similar accuracy as an average breast radiologist. AI can be used as decision&#xD;
      support by highlighting suspicious findings in the image as well as a means to triage screen&#xD;
      exams according to risk of malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible women will be randomized (1:1) to the intervention (AI-integrated mammography&#xD;
      screening) or control arm (conventional mammography screening). In the intervention arm,&#xD;
      exams will be analysed with AI and triaged into two groups based on risk of malignancy. Low&#xD;
      risk exams will be single read and high risk exams will be double read. The high risk group&#xD;
      will contain appx. 10% of the screening population. Within the high-risk group, exams with&#xD;
      the highest 1% risk will by default be recalled by the readers with the exception of obvious&#xD;
      false positives. AI risk scores and Computer-Aided Detection (CAD)-marks of suspicious&#xD;
      calcifications and masses are provided to the reader(s). In the control arm, screen exams are&#xD;
      double read without AI (standard of care). Considering the interplay of number of interval&#xD;
      cancers and workload, the study will be considered successful if the interval-cancer rate in&#xD;
      the intervention arm is not more than 20% larger than in the control arm. If the&#xD;
      interval-cancer rate is statistically and clinically significantly lower in the intervention&#xD;
      arm than in the control arm, AI-integrated mammography screening will be considered superior&#xD;
      to conventional mammography screening.&#xD;

    <description>Screen exam will be analysed with an AI system (Transpara, ScreenPoint, Nijmegen, The Netherlands) that assigns exams with a cancer-risk score from 1 to 10, as well as presenting CAD-marks at suspicious findings. Exams with risk score 1-9 will be single read and exam with score 10 will be double read. Risk scores and CAD-marks are provided to the reader(s). The reader(s) will decide whether to recall the woman for work-up or not (as per standard of care). In addition, exams with the highest 1% risk will by default be recalled with the exception of obvious false positives.</description>
