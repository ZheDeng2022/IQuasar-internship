      Diabetes care is complex and requires a multidimensional approach, but interventional&#xD;
      programs are difficult to initiate in low-income and minority populations. In the proposed&#xD;
      study, investigators will mentor local clinics via telehealth to initiate our diabetes&#xD;
      program, TIME (Telehealth-supported, Integrated CHWs, Medication-access, group visit&#xD;
      Education), into their clinics. Mentoring local clinics to initiate TIME is a promising&#xD;
      strategy to enhance sustainable diabetes care and reduce disparities in vulnerable minority&#xD;
      populations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes is a major public health problem in Latino(a)s. There are escalating numbers of&#xD;
      Latino(a)s diagnosed with diabetes and at disproportionate rates compared to other&#xD;
      ethnicities. Numerous interventions have been initiated to improve minority healthcare&#xD;
      including diabetes group visits, which have been valuable in improving education and glycemic&#xD;
      control. In our group visit investigations, investigators initiated Community Health Workers&#xD;
      (CHWs)-local community members who serve as culturally-sensitive patient liaisons to the&#xD;
      healthcare system-as part of the multidisciplinary team. Investigators demonstrated that CHWs&#xD;
      are vital team members and particularly helpful in identifying medication-access barriers.&#xD;
      However, CHWs are frontline workers and often left unsupported and poorly supervised.&#xD;
      Investigators used these data to pioneer the combination of four diabetes interventions in&#xD;
      our TIME trial (Telehealth-supported, Integrated CHWs, Medication-access, group visit&#xD;
      Education). The TIME trial showed that individuals randomized to TIME significantly improved&#xD;
      glycemic control, blood pressure and adherence to American Diabetes Association standards&#xD;
      compared to usual care. The study also showed that telehealth (mobile health (mHealth) and&#xD;
      ZOOM video conferencing) was instrumental in supporting CHWs in their work and enhancing&#xD;
      their communication with patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the expansive use of telehealth and its ability to&#xD;
      improve healthcare. It has also underscored the pressing need to improve care for low-income&#xD;
      minorities. Though diabetes programs are valuable in improving education and clinical&#xD;
      outcomes, they are often difficult to initiate in low-income settings. Pragmatic&#xD;
      implementation using telehealth to mentor local clinic teams of providers and CHWs is&#xD;
      promising to address these barriers. Investigators have pilot data showing the feasibility of&#xD;
      telementoring a local clinic to initiate TIME that has resulted in improved HbA1c levels but&#xD;
      it needs to be tested within a larger sample. In the proposed study investigators will&#xD;
      evaluate this approach in a randomized clinical trial (N=250; intervention=125) of&#xD;
      low-income, adult Latino(a)s with type 2 diabetes randomized to TIME (intervention) versus&#xD;
      usual care enhanced with education (EUC). Our research group will provide telementoring to&#xD;
      local clinic teams to initiate TIME into their clinics. To evaluate efficacy, investigators&#xD;
      will compare TIME versus EUC clinical changes including HbA1c (primary outcome), blood&#xD;
      pressure, cholesterol, and body mass index from baseline to 12-months (AIM 1). To compare&#xD;
      longitudinal data of study arms, investigators will follow these clinical measures until 36&#xD;
      months (AIM 2). Investigators will also provide TIME program acceptability and evaluation&#xD;
      data for participants and clinic teams from baseline to 12-months (AIM 3). Investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that TIME participants will have superior and more sustainable clinical outcomes&#xD;
      compared to EUC individuals and that the intervention will have high levels of acceptability&#xD;
      and evaluation data. Investigators anticipate that the proposed study will provide&#xD;
      justification of telementoring to initiate TIME and strong evidence to improve the&#xD;
      longitudinal care of low-income Latino(a)s with diabetes.&#xD;

Individuals entering and obtaining study data will be blinded to study arm&#xD;
Data will be collected prior to randomization for blinding purposes. Month-12 clinical data will be obtained in-person for both arms by nurses blinded to the study arm e.g., different nurses than those in the group visits, and chart review will be conducted for ADA measurements and for other clinical data if individuals from either study arm do not show.&#xD;
Blinded research assistants will gather HbA1c, blood pressure, cholesterol, and BMI data for both arms quarterly until 36-months from baseline.</masking_description>
