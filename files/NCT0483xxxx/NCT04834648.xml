      An effective referral system helps to ensure a close relationship between all levels of the&#xD;
      health system and ensures clients receive optimum care at the appropriate level and at&#xD;
      affordable cost, and hospital facilities are used optimally and cost-effectively. A referral&#xD;
      system requires consideration of all its important components that can be then adjusted to&#xD;
      the local situation. Being a system, the important components of a referral system are Health&#xD;
      system issues (Service providers, Referral protocols, Communication &amp; transportation&#xD;
      provide), Referring facility&amp; Referral practicalities (Client &amp; their condition, Protocols of&#xD;
      care, Care provider &amp; documents, Referral decision, Outward referral form, Communicate with&#xD;
      referral facility, Client information, Referral register), Referral facility&amp; Referral&#xD;
      practicalities (Client with referral form, Treat the client with the document, Rehabilitation&#xD;
      plan, Back referral form, Feedback to referring facility, Referral register) and Supervision&#xD;
      and capacity building (Referral monitoring, Ensure back referral, Feedback and training to&#xD;
      facility staff and Feedback to central level) ((USAID), 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are mainly two limitations on referring Diabetic Retinopathy patients. Patient-related&#xD;
      reasons: lack of awareness, belief, cost, distance from screening/ treatment centers,&#xD;
      discomfort from dilating drops, efforts to attend yet another center, fear of laser&#xD;
      treatment, fear of its impact on quality of life and jobs, lack of family support and guilt&#xD;
      surrounding the failure to control blood sugar. Provider-related reasons are poor counseling&#xD;
      and advisory services about ocular complications for patients with diabetes, inefficient call&#xD;
      and recall system, long waiting times for screening or treatment, and complicated referral&#xD;
      mechanism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lumbini eye institute is a comprehensive tertiary eye care center in western Nepal. In spite&#xD;
      of 19 peripheral referral centers under it, there is a poor inflow of Diabetic retinopathy&#xD;
      patients as against the estimated disease burden in the catchment area. The objective of our&#xD;
      study is to improve timely referral flow from referring centers and compliance with referral&#xD;
      cases after the intervention. In order to meet our objective, the investigators tend to&#xD;
      implement patient counseling at referral centers, a referral tracking system, and a&#xD;
      fast-track mechanism for patients at base hospitals.&#xD;

      Background: Changes in lifestyle and a growing number of aging populations have increased the&#xD;
      prevalence of diabetes worldwide. Diabetes imposes a heavy disease burden in both developed&#xD;
      and developing countries (1). Diabetic retinopathy is the commonest microvascular&#xD;
      complication of diabetes and the leading cause of blindness in adults. There are no symptoms&#xD;
      initially; visual impairment is seen in the proliferative stage and in macular involvement.&#xD;
      Vision once lost will never be regained (2). The prevalence of diabetic retinopathy was&#xD;
      10%-50% for Type 1 and 25.2% for Type2. The worldwide prevalence of diabetic retinopathy was&#xD;
      found to be 34.6%. WHO estimates Diabetic retinopathy is responsible for 4.8% of 37 million&#xD;
      cases of blindness throughout the world. Several studies in Nepal showed the prevalence of 9%&#xD;
      to 78%. A study at LEIRC showed PDR and ADED to 34%; this suggests a major blockage of cases&#xD;
      at the tertiary and primary level (2013-2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early diagnosis and treatment are the key components to reduce Diabetic blindness. A&#xD;
      comprehensive set of guidelines (CARE 2019) recommends initial dilatation and comprehensive&#xD;
      eye examination by an optometrist or ophthalmologist. Patient with Mild, Moderate and Severe&#xD;
      Diabetic retinopathy requires a referral and they need reexamination or follow up within time&#xD;
      limit of 3-6 months, less than 3 months and less than 1 month respectively. Incidence of&#xD;
      visual loss secondary to proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy can be reduced by referral to an&#xD;
      ophthalmologist. Multiple studies show laser photocoagulation of new vessels reduces the&#xD;
      incidence of Diabetic Blindness by 60% to 80%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lumbini eye institute is a comprehensive tertiary eye care center in western Nepal. In spite&#xD;
      of 19 peripheral referral centers under it, there is a poor inflow of Diabetic retinopathy&#xD;
      patients as against the estimated disease burden in the catchment area. There are mainly two&#xD;
      limitations on referring Diabetic Retinopathy patients. Patient-related reasons: lack of&#xD;
      awareness, belief, cost, distance from screening/ treatment centers, discomfort from dilating&#xD;
      drops, efforts to attend yet another center, fear of laser treatment, fear of its impact on&#xD;
      quality of life and jobs, lack of family support and guilt surrounding the failure to control&#xD;
      blood sugar. Provider-related reasons are poor counseling and advisory services about ocular&#xD;
      complications for patients of diabetes, inefficient call and recall system, long waiting&#xD;
      times for screening or treatment, and complicated referral mechanism (2). Considering these&#xD;
      reasons and problem tree analysis effective interventions designed. Counseling and telephonic&#xD;
      follow-up at referring facility; fast track system at the base hospital. The objective of our&#xD;
      study is to improve timely referral flow from referring centers and compliance with referral&#xD;
      cases after the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Two arm parallel, cluster Randomised control trial with allocation ratio 1:1&#xD;
      will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Setting :&#xD;
&#xD;
      All diabetic retinopathy patients attending peripheral eye care centers will be the study&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lumbini Eye Institute and Research Center (LEIRC) - a comprehensive tertiary referral eye&#xD;
      care center located in the Western part of Nepal has nineteen referring centers: five&#xD;
      secondary eye hospitals (SEC), three district eye care centers (DECC), and eleven primary eye&#xD;
      care centers (PECC). The referral center (LEIRC) has several sub-specialty services; the&#xD;
      Retina department is well equipped with two consultants, one retina fellow, and one separate&#xD;
      counselor. A secondary eye hospital has a general ophthalmologist, ophthalmic paramedical&#xD;
      personnel (optometrist/ophthalmic assistant), and a counselor with limited diagnostic tools&#xD;
      for diabetic retinopathy (DR). A primary/district eye care center has ophthalmic paramedical&#xD;
      personnel (optometrist/ophthalmic assistant) and an optician with a direct ophthalmoscope for&#xD;
      retina examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Masking: At LEI the staff will be blinded about the intervention/ control referring centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection plan: An experienced team member will be responsible for data collection and&#xD;
      telephonic follow-up. the project coordinator will be trained thoroughly trained on the&#xD;
      completion of the data collection form Data Management Plan: The demographic information and&#xD;
      other variables of the patient who are referred from peripheral eye care centers will be&#xD;
      collected and entered in an excel sheet. One of the team members will be responsible for data&#xD;
      management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analytic plan: Data will be analyzed using IBM SPSS. Differences indifference in&#xD;
      compliance and referral rates will be computed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study period: Approximately 19 months (March 2020 to December 2021) Ethical consideration:&#xD;
      Ethical approval is taken from the Institutional review committee, LEIRC. Data&#xD;
      confidentiality will be maintained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written Consent form including the title of the study and their support during the study&#xD;
      period was sent to all 10 centers included in the study. These consent forms were signed by&#xD;
      the head of centers on 12th June 2020 and sent to LEIRC. Ethical Approval from the&#xD;
      Institutional Review Committee (IRC) of LEIRC was taken on 8th August 2020. Data&#xD;
      confidentiality will be maintained. No personal information will be used in analysis,&#xD;
      reports, and publications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetic Retinopathy is a global epidemic in both developed and developing countries with&#xD;
      significant morbidity and mortality. In a study done by Mishra SK et al, they found people&#xD;
      were less aware of the microvascular complications of diabetes. They didn't meet the&#xD;
      physician regularly for diabetes control and didn't know about regular eye examinations with&#xD;
      ophthalmologists. Even though the incidence of blindness secondary to diabetes mellitus can&#xD;
      be significantly reduced; there is still a large number of diabetes patient with vision loss&#xD;
      due to retinal complications of the disease In a study done by Tien Y. Wang et al, they came&#xD;
      with a broad-based system-level approach to prevent vision loss resulting from Diabetic&#xD;
      Retinopathy: 1: Targeted health care education to improve public knowledge. 2:&#xD;
      well-implemented community or national level screening programs for all patients with&#xD;
      diabetes. 3: Timely referral for severe level of Diabetic Retinopathy. 4: Appropriate&#xD;
      treatment for advanced Diabetic Retinopathy (PDR and DME).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our study the investigators wanted to make the patient aware of the changes diabetes can&#xD;
      bring to the eye, the investigators implemented Structured Counseling where the patient is&#xD;
      explained in detail about the changes diabetes makes in the eye. It also includes the impact&#xD;
      on vision and different treatment options available and the rate. They are also explained to&#xD;
      go to a base hospital where they will be evaluated by a retina specialist thus decreasing a&#xD;
      load of visual impairment due to diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      World Health Organization (WHO) has identified adherence to follow-up services as a key&#xD;
      component in effective management of Diabetic Retinopathy9. In this study, they found&#xD;
      improving the clarity of the referral process by explaining the treatment costs, the reason&#xD;
      for referral, and likely health benefits to the patient helped by increasing follow-up&#xD;
      rates9. Keeping this in the investigators explained the treatment cost and about the base&#xD;
      hospital in detain as our structured counseling. A study done by Mishra SK et al found major&#xD;
      facilitator was the existence of referral slips to expedite treatment upon reaching the&#xD;
      health facility and the major barrier was a failure to receive preferential treatment at the&#xD;
      facility, despite the presence of the slip. In addition to this, they found lack of feedback&#xD;
      as a barrier to functional referral system 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similarly, during our problem tree analysis, the investigators found a longer waiting time&#xD;
      and no preferential treatment as a factor in the referral system. The investigators tried&#xD;
      implementing a referral slip and planned to decrease the waiting time by allowing them to&#xD;
      visit the ophthalmologist directly at our center. This point will also be explained by the&#xD;
      counselor during counseling.&#xD;
