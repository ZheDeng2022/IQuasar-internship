  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression and anxiety are increasingly common conditions for which primary care providers&#xD;
      (PCPs) serve as the initial healthcare contact for most patients. Comorbid depression and&#xD;
      anxiety result in higher costs, and treatment as usual, which is referrals to specialty&#xD;
      psychiatric care, often contribute to delays in care. Collaborative psychiatric care is an&#xD;
      evidence-based strategy to increase mental healthcare access while reducing costs. ADAPT is a&#xD;
      novel collaborative care model. By using technology-driven appointments with providers, ADAPT&#xD;
      increases access to mental healthcare, and reduces member wait times. This mixed methods&#xD;
      study will assess implementation measures of the ADAPT program and the components of ADAPT&#xD;
      related to patient mental health improvement compared to specialty mental health care. The&#xD;
      hypothesis is that: ADAPT program will have good program reach and efficacy. We will examine&#xD;
      program implementation and maintenance. Further, the study looks to uncover member and&#xD;
      program characteristics that are associated with depression and anxiety remission and care&#xD;
      utilization.&#xD;

    <description>The Achieving Depression and Anxiety Patient Centered Treatment (ADAPT) Program is a novel collaborative psychiatric care model that is designed to unburden PCPs and psychiatrists, increase access to quality specialty mental healthcare for Kaiser Permanente members, and improve patient depression and anxiety treatment outcomes by utilizing technology-driven appointments. This program uses principles of collaborative care, including patient-centered care, population-based care, evidence-based care, measurement-based treatment to target, and accountable care.</description>
