      Introduction: Fetal exposure to glucocorticoids (GCs) used to induce fetal lung maturation in&#xD;
      women threatened by premature labour is known to induce aberrations in brain development and&#xD;
      stress sensitivity, cognitive dysfunction and neuro-psychiatric disorders in later life which&#xD;
      all predict early brain ageing. Another common source of fetal GC exposure is the treatment&#xD;
      of relapses in multiple sclerosis (MS), the most common neurological disease in young women.&#xD;
      Despite the lack of studies, the 300-fold higher dosage of GCs for MS relapse treatment&#xD;
      compared to obstetric indications is considered harmless for the fetus . Objectives: To&#xD;
      examine the effects of GCs for MS relapse treatment during pregnancy on offspring structural&#xD;
      and functional brain development, stress sensitivity, and cognitive and behavioural&#xD;
      performance. Methods: Epidemiological multi-centre cohort study in 80 children and&#xD;
      adolescents aged 8 to 18 years whose mothers received GCs to treat a MS relapse during&#xD;
      pregnancy compared to unexposed participants. Expected Impact: Creating a guideline-changing&#xD;
      evidence-based risk-benefit assessment regarding benefits of the MS relapse therapy for the&#xD;
      mother and potential harm to the child.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Introduction: Multiple Sclerosis (MS) affects 1 in 1,000 people in industrialised countries,&#xD;
      mainly women of childbearing age. To prevent MS relapses, most patients receive&#xD;
      disease-modifying therapies (DMTs). However, most DMTs - with the exception of interferons&#xD;
      and glatiramer acetate - are not approved during pregnancy. Consequently, DMTs are regularly&#xD;
      discontinued during pregnancy with a subsequently increased risk of relapses. Thus, relapses&#xD;
      during pregnancy are a common phenomenon. The average relapse rate per year in pregnant MS&#xD;
      patients not taking DMTs during the 1st and 2nd trimester is nearly identical to the&#xD;
      pre-partum period after which it significantly declines during the 3rd Trimester. The German&#xD;
      Neurologic Society estimates that approximately 25% of all pregnant women with MS will suffer&#xD;
      a relapse during their pregnancy period(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is generally recommended by European and US guidelines to treat MS relapses during&#xD;
      pregnancy with the synthetic glucocorticoid (GC) methylprednisolone (MP), which is thought to&#xD;
      be harmless for the unborn. However, regardless of the undoubtedly positive effects of GCs&#xD;
      for MS relapse treatment, there is considerable doubt as to whether synthetic GCs are as low&#xD;
      in side effects for the child as MS guidelines assume. The fetus develops in the presence of&#xD;
      very low GC levels because it is unable to produce cortisol until the end of pregnancy and&#xD;
      about 90% of maternal cortisol is being inactivated by the placental enzyme 11ß-HSD2. In&#xD;
      contrast to maternal cortisol, synthetic GCs are no substrate for the placental enzyme&#xD;
      11ß-HSD2 and, thus, pass the placenta without being inactivated. Once within the fetal&#xD;
      circulation, GCs interfere with the development of the fetal central nervous system (CNS).&#xD;
      The effects of synthetic GCs on fetal development and health and disease in later life as&#xD;
      well as the mechanisms mediating these effects are best characterised for betamethasone&#xD;
      exposure to induce fetal lung maturation in babies threatening premature labour as this&#xD;
      treatment is used in nearly 10% of all pregnancies. In various studies excess exposure to&#xD;
      synthetic GCs is associated with reduced birth weight, altered fetal brain development e.g.,&#xD;
      by direct effect on neuro- and gliogenesis via anti-proliferative effects on neural&#xD;
      stem/progenitor cells, and persisting functional changes of the stress axis with its two&#xD;
      arms, the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPAA) and the autonomic nervous system (ANS).&#xD;
      Supraphysiological GC concentrations are also thought to reset the set point of the negative&#xD;
      feedback regulation of the fetal HPAA which results in an increase of HPAA activity in later&#xD;
      life. Increased HPAA activity has been associated with increased stress sensitivity and a&#xD;
      number of behavioural changes and neuropsychiatric disorders including anxiety,&#xD;
      depressive-like disorders, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The&#xD;
      relationship between adverse environmental influences during critical periods of fetal life,&#xD;
      such as exposure to excess GC, and offspring health in later life is the basis of the 'Fetal&#xD;
      Programming' hypothesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A predecessor study of the investigators' work group tested the hypothesis that fetal&#xD;
      betamethasone treatment impairs structural and functional brain development as well as stress&#xD;
      sensitivity leading to disturbances in overall neurocognitive performance and behaviour in&#xD;
      later life. It is noteworthy, that the dosage of betamethasone (2 x 12mg, 24h apart) was&#xD;
      approximately 300-fold lower than the dosage used to treat MS relapses (1000mg over 3-5&#xD;
      days). As a major study outcome, the investigators noticed detrimental effects of prenatal&#xD;
      betamethasone exposure on general cognitive ability at the age of 8 - 9 years. Intelligence&#xD;
      quotient (IQ)-scores in children who were prenatally exposed to betamethasone were on average&#xD;
      10.5 points lower than in controls, with a large effect size of d = 0.68. Even though&#xD;
      IQ-scores of betamethasone-exposed children were still within the expected population range,&#xD;
      the investigators assume that this difference is clinically relevant and impedes future life&#xD;
      success of the participants. In addition, children exposed to betamethasone showed a&#xD;
      significant increase in ADHD related symptoms on the International Classification of Diseases&#xD;
      (ICD)-10-based rating scale, the Diagnostik-System für psychische Störungen nach ICD-10 und&#xD;
      DSM-5 für Kinder und Jugendliche-III, with a medium effect size of d = 0.51.&#xD;
      Electroencephalographic (EEG) analysis showed that BM-exposed children had a higher spectral&#xD;
      edge frequency at rest and during stress suggesting a reduced overall neuroelectric&#xD;
      relaxation capacity. Heart Rate Variability (HRV) analysis revealed a resetting of the ANS in&#xD;
      betamethasone-exposed children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The primary goal of this study is to examine the general cognitive ability as a&#xD;
      marker of brain development of children of MS patients who received MP to treat an MS relapse&#xD;
      during pregnancy. The secondary goals are to determine the effects of MP administered during&#xD;
      pregnancy on offspring structural and functional brain development and neuropsychiatric and&#xD;
      behavioural performance. Stress sensitivity and epigenetic changes of GC receptor function&#xD;
      will be measured to determine underlying mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is based on the following hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fetal exposure to MP during relapse treatment in pregnant MS patients leads to&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  disturbances in structural and functional brain development due to the maturational&#xD;
           potential of MP which induces asymmetries in the complex sequence of the maturation of&#xD;
           cerebral functional systems with lifelong changes in brain function,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  permanent alterations in HPAA sensitivity and autonomic function which are associated&#xD;
           with neuropsychiatric and behavioural disturbances in later life, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  alterations in GC receptor function and methylation of the GC receptor gene (NR3C1) and&#xD;
           the H19/IGF2 locus as the underlying mechanisms linking MP exposition during pregnancy&#xD;
           and offspring cognitive and behavioural functioning in later life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The investigators will carry out a multicentre, observational, cross-sectional study&#xD;
      in children and adolescents aged 8 to 18 years. The study design is retrospective due to&#xD;
      ethical considerations of withholding the standard relapse treatment and the long study&#xD;
      duration of at least 10 years. Following recruitment, all participants will undergo the same&#xD;
      examination procedures in one study visit consisting of two days. By extending the study&#xD;
      visit to two days, the investigators ensure stress-free examinations. In general, day 1 and&#xD;
      day 2 of the study visits take place in direct succession. However, in case of scheduling&#xD;
      issues or if the children and their parents live close by and do not want to stay overnight,&#xD;
      there may be a few days in between.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sequence of examinations was chosen in such a way that blood sampling and&#xD;
      neuropsychological examinations induce as little stress as possible for the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Functional brain development: The investigators will apply state-of-the-art&#xD;
           neurocognitive, behavioural and mental health measures to determine the stage of&#xD;
           functional brain development: General cognitive ability (primary endpoint) is determined&#xD;
           using German age-appropriate versions of the Reynolds Intellectual Assessment Scales and&#xD;
           Screening (RIAS) intelligence test. Behaviour is measured using three external&#xD;
           assessment questionnaires which are routinely used in clinics and the scientific&#xD;
           community. The German rating scale Fremdbeurteilungsbogen für&#xD;
           Aufmerksamkeitsdefizit-/Hyperaktivitätsstörungen (FBB-ADHS) is based on the ICD-10&#xD;
           criteria for ADHD and assesses inattentiveness, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. The&#xD;
           child behaviour checklist (CBCL), an established diagnostic screening procedure,&#xD;
           measures psychopathological abnormalities in children and adolescents. The strengths and&#xD;
           difficulties questionnaire (SDQ) assesses children's strengths and weaknesses. The&#xD;
           Continuous Performance Test (CPT) is a clinically and scientifically established&#xD;
           instrument to detect selective attention, vigilance, and impulsive behaviour with&#xD;
           sufficient reliability and validity. Motor development is assessed using the Movement&#xD;
           Assessment Battery for Children - Second Edition (M-ABC 2), which allows a reliable and&#xD;
           time-efficient assessment of motor-coordinative deficits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Structural brain development: The stage of structural brain development will be&#xD;
           quantified based on a volumetric T1-MRI standard sequence using markers such as&#xD;
           gyrification and cortical thickness as well as the BrainAge Score, which was development&#xD;
           by the investigators' research group. The investigators expect that prenatal MP has a&#xD;
           significant effect on brain age since GCs accelerate tissue differentiation and&#xD;
           maturation at the expense of tissue growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Stress sensitivity and autonomic function: The individual stress sensitivity including&#xD;
           the function of the HPAA and the autonomic nervous system is examined using the Trier&#xD;
           Social Stress Test (TSST). This is an established and commonly used tool for children to&#xD;
           generate a reproducible psychophysiological stress response using a simulated&#xD;
           examination situation. It comprises a 10 minute rest period and a task period consisting&#xD;
           of five-minute story-telling and mental arithmetic periods, which is completed in front&#xD;
           of an &quot;examination committee&quot;. Saliva samples for measurement of cortisol levels and&#xD;
           alpha-amylase are taken before and during the stress test to determine HPAA and&#xD;
           sympathetic activity at rest and during activation. In addition, continuous&#xD;
           electrocardiography (ECG) and EEG leads are performed. The autonomic activity is also&#xD;
           determined using HRV analysis from the derived ECG based on established HRV standards as&#xD;
           well as on innovative nonlinear information based approaches developed at the&#xD;
           department. Autonomic activity reflected in HRV is a sensitive marker of disturbances in&#xD;
           the neurodevelopmental trajectory. Neurophysiological activation is measured using power&#xD;
           spectral and nonlinear EEG analysis techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Mechanism: The investigators will determine GC receptor sensitivity and epigenetic&#xD;
           changes of the NR3C1 promoter and the H19/IGF2 locus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Impact: The results of this study will improve the ability of clinicians to make an&#xD;
      evidence-based benefit-risk assessment regarding the continuation of a DMT during pregnancy&#xD;
      under consideration of its safety under 'real world' conditions in relation to the potential&#xD;
      long-term risks of an acute relapse therapy with MP for the health of the unborn child in&#xD;
      later life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators expect that the results will provide an additional argument (1) to continue&#xD;
      immunomodulatory relapse prophylaxis, e.g. with interferons during pregnancy, especially in&#xD;
      light of their recently recognized relative safety for the child, or (2) to choose a&#xD;
      long-acting DMT such as cladribine that provides lasting protection from relapses during&#xD;
      pregnancy.&#xD;
