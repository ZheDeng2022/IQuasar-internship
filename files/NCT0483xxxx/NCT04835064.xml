    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled Ⅲ period clinical trials.A&#xD;
      total of 600 patients with resectable pancreatic cancer assessed by imaging and serum&#xD;
      CA125≥35 U/mL were randomly assigned according to the ratio of 1:1 (300 cases: 300 cases)&#xD;
      between the direct surgical resection group and the neoadjuvant chemotherapy group, to&#xD;
      observe the efficacy and safety of patients with resectable pancreatic cancer with elevated&#xD;
      serum CA125 with or without neoadjuvant chemotherapy.Neoadjuvant chemotherapy and adjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy can use albumin-binding paclitaxel combined with gemcitabine (AG) regimen or&#xD;
      mFOLFirinox (5-FU, calcium leucofolate [LV], irinotecan, oxaliplatin) regimen. AG regimen was&#xD;
      given on day 1, 8, 15, and repeated every 4 weeks.The mFOLFIRINOX regimen was administered on&#xD;
      days 1 and 15 and repeated every 4 weeks.Patients in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy group were&#xD;
      treated with 4 courses of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (AG regimen or mFOLFIRINOX regimen)&#xD;
      immediately after the pathologic diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma was confirmed by&#xD;
      puncture.Patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy will undergo surgical exploration to&#xD;
      assess the resectability of the tumor.Four to eight weeks after radical resection, the&#xD;
      patients were treated with adjuvant chemotherapy from the recovery of surgical trauma. The&#xD;
      choice of adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery depended on the response to neoadjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy.If neoadjuvant chemotherapy is effective, adjuvant chemotherapy will maintain&#xD;
      the original regimen;If neoadjuvant chemotherapy is ineffective but radical surgery is still&#xD;
      feasible, adjuvant chemotherapy will be used with a crossover regimen.Neoadjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy group received adjuvant chemotherapy for 2 courses.In the direct surgical&#xD;
      resection group, 6 courses of adjuvant chemotherapy were started 4 to 8 weeks after radical&#xD;
      resection.Relevant examinations should be conducted before and after each course of&#xD;
      medication to evaluate safety events. Imaging reexaminations should be conducted every 2&#xD;
      courses of medication, and imaging reexaminations should be conducted every 3 months during&#xD;
      follow-up to evaluate disease recurrence.&#xD;
