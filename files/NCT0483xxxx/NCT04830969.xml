  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With poorly controlled diabetes, periodontal status often worsens, and with severe&#xD;
      periodontal conditions there is often poorer glycemic control. There are few published&#xD;
      reports investigating the efficacy of periodontal therapy in diabetics and fewer that include&#xD;
      evaluation of the oral microbial profiles (the microbiome). The investigators will examine&#xD;
      systemic changes in diabetes status and microbiome influences on clinical response to&#xD;
      periodontal therapy in a randomized clinical trial of participants with and without diabetes&#xD;
      and with periodontal disease. Two different treatments will be used:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Scaling and root planning (SRP) alone, or&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. SRP and supportive periodontal therapy (SPT), the use of chlorhexidine gluconate rinse&#xD;
           (Paroex®) and a rubber interdental bristle cleaner (Soft-Picks) The main goal of this&#xD;
           clinical trial is to evaluate the effects of SRP alone versus SRP+SPT on clinical,&#xD;
           microbiological and immunological status in participants. A clearer understanding of how&#xD;
           periodontal therapy affects diabetes status could lead to the development of new&#xD;
           therapies for periodontal disease and diabetes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With poorly controlled diabetes, periodontal disease worsens, and with severe periodontal&#xD;
      conditions, there is often poorer glycemic control. Published papers conclude that&#xD;
      periodontal treatment leads to a reduction in hemoglobin A1c; however, other studies show&#xD;
      limited or no improvement. Some patients do not respond well to professional periodontal&#xD;
      therapy, even without diabetes, which could be related to poor oral hygiene and/or host&#xD;
      factors including microbial profiles. There are few published papers investigating the&#xD;
      efficacy of periodontal therapy in diabetics and fewer that include assessment of the oral&#xD;
      microbiome. The investigators will examine systemic changes in diabetes status and microbiome&#xD;
      influences on clinical response to periodontal therapy in a randomized clinical trial. It has&#xD;
      been shown that chlorhexidine gluconate rinse leads to significant clinical improvement over&#xD;
      standard periodontal therapy alone, and interdental tooth cleaners remove more dental plaque&#xD;
      (leading to reduced gingival inflammation) effectively than brushing alone. Therefore, in&#xD;
      this study, standard periodontal therapy, scaling and root planning (SRP) will be provided&#xD;
      alone, or SRP plus supportive periodontal therapy (SPT), the use of chlorhexidine gluconate&#xD;
      rinse (Paroex®) and a rubber interdental bristle cleaner (Soft-Picks), to diabetics and&#xD;
      non-diabetics with periodontal disease to determine the differences in response between the&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of SRP alone versus SRP+SPT on&#xD;
      clinical, microbiological and immunological status of subjects with and without type 2&#xD;
      diabetes and with periodontal disease. A clearer understanding of how periodontal therapy&#xD;
      affects diabetes status could lead to the development of novel new targeted therapies of both&#xD;
      periodontal disease and diabetes.&#xD;

    <measure>Changes in Hemoglobin A1c at 3, 6, and 12 months after treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 3 months; Baseline to 6 months; Baseline to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Hemoglobin in A1c (HbA1c) tells the average level of blood sugar over the prior 2 to 3 months. Normal level is below 5.7%; 5.7%-6.4% indicates prediabetes; greater than 6.5% is indicative of diabetes.</description>

    <description>Fasting blood sugar/glucose (FBS/FBG) is tested with a blood sample taken after an overnight fast. A fasting blood sugar level less than 100 mg/dL is normal; a fasting blood sugar level from 100 to 125 mg/dL is considered prediabetes; a level 126 mg/dL (7 mmol/L) or higher on two separate tests, indicates diabetes.</description>

    <measure>Change in insulin at 3, 6, and 12 months after treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 3 months; Baseline to 6 months; Baseline to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Insulin is measured in a fasting state from a blood draw and indicates the body's baseline resistance or sensitivity to insulin. It is used to monitor the amount of insulin produced and identify insulin resistance. If the level is low (less than 2 mcUnit/mL) it means not enough insulin is being produced; if the level is high (more than 20 mcUnit/mL) it indicates diabetes and insulin resistance (or another metabolic disorder).</description>

    <measure>Change in high sensitivity C-reactive protein at 3, 6, and 12 months after treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 3 months; Baseline to 6 months; Baseline to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) blood test measures body inflammation indicating infection or a chronic inflammatory disease such as periodontitis or diabetes. It also can be used to evaluate risk of developing coronary artery disease. A normal reading is less than 10 milligram per liter (mg/L); a level greater than 10 mg/L is a sign of serious infection, trauma or chronic disease likely requiring further testing to determine cause</description>

    <measure>Change in the subgingival plaque microbiome after periodontal treatment in group with SRP alone versus SRP + SPT.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 3 months; Baseline to 6 months; Baseline to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Recent data indicate that the oral microbiome has essential functions in maintaining oral and systemic health. However, there is not much information available, and there are not many published reports investigating the benefits of periodontal therapy on the microbiome in diabetics. We think the microbiome influences clinical response to periodontal therapy and systemic changes showing improvement in diabetes status. We will examine the subgingival plaque microbiome in the four groups of participants. We will compare the different kinds and numbers of bacteria before and after the two treatments (SRP alone versus SRP+SPT (use of a mouthrinse and Soft Picks)) of periodontitis in diabetics and non-diabetics.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to 3 months; Baseline to 6 months; Baseline to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Recent data indicate that the oral microbiome has essential functions in maintaining oral and systemic health. In addition, there is not much information about how the gut (intestinal) microbiome influences general and oral health especially in periodontitis and diabetics. We think the gut microbiome may change after periodontal therapy is provided and after systemic changes showing improvement in diabetes status occur. We will examine the gut microbiome in the four groups of participants. We will compare the different kinds and numbers of bacteria before and after the two treatments of periodontitis (SRP alone versus SRP+SPT (use of a mouthrinse and Soft Picks)) in diabetics and non-diabetics.</description>

    <description>Paroex® is a non-alcohol chlorhexidine preparation. Participants are to use 15 mL morning and evening for 3 months. With use of chlorhexidine, there is risk of reversible staining of teeth and the possibility of some alteration in taste. There is increased likeliness of staining in smokers, coffee drinkers and those who are susceptible to teeth staining in general. The cleaning of the front teeth is provided at the 3-month visit and helps to reduce any staining that may occur. If there is any alteration in taste, it should go away when use of chlorhexidine stops.</description>
