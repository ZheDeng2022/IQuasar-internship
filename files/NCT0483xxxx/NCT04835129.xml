  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label phase II study in subjects with relapsed and/or refractory&#xD;
      multiple myeloma with at least two prior lines of therapy. The main study consists of three&#xD;
      phases: a 28-day screening phase, treatment phase that consists of 28-day cycles of&#xD;
      isatuximab with elotuzumab, pomalidomide, and dexamethasone and a follow-up phase.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is divided into two parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 (Run-in safety phase): In this safety-run in phase a total of six subjects will be&#xD;
      enrolled at the coordinating site (Medical College of Wisconsin) to assess potential&#xD;
      dose-limiting toxicities that may be associated with the addition of isatuximab with&#xD;
      pomalidomide, elotuzumab and dexamethasone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 (Expansion phase): In this part, up to 47 additional subjects will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesis is that the isatuximab in combination with elotuzumab, pomalidomide, and&#xD;
      dexamethasone (Isa-EPD) will be safe and lead to superior response rates than seen with&#xD;
      either isatuximab with pomalidomide and dexamethasone or elotuzumab with pomalidomide and&#xD;
      dexamethasone in subjects with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma.&#xD;

          1. Voluntary consent must be given before performance of any study related procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Male or female subjects ≥18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Multiple myeloma subjects with at least 2 prior therapies that included lenalidomide&#xD;
             and proteasome inhibitor combined or in different regimens, and refractory to most&#xD;
             recent line of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Measurable disease as defined by any of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum M-protein level ≥0.5 g/dL OR&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Light chain multiple myeloma without measurable disease in the urine: serum Ig&#xD;
                  free light chains (FLC) ≥10 mg/dL and abnormal serum Ig kappa/lambda FLC ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Female subjects who:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Are postmenopausal (see Appendix 4 for definition) for at least one year before&#xD;
                  the screening visit, OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Are surgically sterile, OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Females of childbearing potential or male subjects with female partners of&#xD;
                  childbearing potential shall be required to use effective contraceptive methods&#xD;

                  starting two weeks before first study drug(s) administration, while on therapy&#xD;
                  and for 16 weeks following the last dose of study drug(s). A woman is considered&#xD;
                  of childbearing potential, i.e., fertile, following menarche and until becoming&#xD;
                  postmenopausal unless permanently sterile. Any of the following highly effective&#xD;
                  methods of contraception are accepted:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Established use of oral, intravaginal, or transdermal combined (estrogen and&#xD;
                       progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of&#xD;
                       ovulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Established use of oral, injectable, or implantable progestogen-only&#xD;
                       hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Placement of an intrauterine device or intrauterine hormone-releasing&#xD;
                       system.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Barrier methods of contraception: male condom with either cap, diaphragm or&#xD;
                       sponge with spermicide (double-barrier methods). The use of double-barrier&#xD;
                       methods should always be supplemented with the use of a spermicide. Female&#xD;
                       condom and male condom should not be used together.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Male sterilization (provided that the partner is the sole sexual partner of&#xD;
                       the subject and that the sterilized partner has received medical assessment&#xD;
                       of the surgical success).&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Sexual abstinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Female subjects must agree not to donate eggs (ova, oocytes) for the&#xD;
                       purposes of assisted reproduction starting two weeks before first study&#xD;
                       drug(s) administration, while on therapy and for 16 weeks following the last&#xD;
                       dose of study drug(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy&#xD;
                  test prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Male subjects, even if surgically sterilized (i.e., status post vasectomy), who:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Agree to practice effective barrier contraception during the entire study&#xD;
                  treatment period from the time of signing the informed consent through and&#xD;
                  through four months after the last dose of study drug(s) (female and male condoms&#xD;
                  should not be used together), or&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Agree to practice true abstinence during the entire study treatment period from&#xD;
                  the time of signing the informed consent through four months after the last dose&#xD;
                  of study drug(s), when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of&#xD;
                  the subject. (Periodic abstinence [e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post&#xD;
                  ovulation methods for the female partner] withdrawal, spermicides only, and&#xD;
                  lactational amenorrhea are not acceptable methods of contraception.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Due to the teratogenicity of pomalidomide and the lack of adequate reproductive&#xD;
             toxicity data for isatuximab and/or elotuzumab, in addition to the user independent&#xD;
             highly effective method of contraception, a male or female condom with or without&#xD;
             spermicide, diaphragm, or cervical cap is required. Male condom and female condom&#xD;
             should not be used together (due to risk of failure with friction).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Diagnosed or treated for malignancy other than multiple myeloma, except:&#xD;
&#xD;
