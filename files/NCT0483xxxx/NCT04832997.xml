  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a monocentre, paired-cohort, prospective study. Patients with a clinical suspicion of&#xD;
      csPCa will receive mpMRI and Micro-US in two different visits. The results of the diagnostic&#xD;
      procedures will determine how many and which type prostate biopsies patients will undergo.&#xD;
      During the following visit patients with both positive mpMRI and Micro-US, defined as the&#xD;
      presence of one or more lesions with PI-RADS ≥ 3 and PRI-MUS ≥ 3 respectively, will receive a&#xD;
      12-core TRUSBx in addiction to MRI-TBx and Micro-US-TBx (Group 4). Patients with both&#xD;
      negative mpMRI and Micro-US will receive a 12-core TRUSBx (Group 1). Patients with only&#xD;
      postitive mpMRI will receive MRI-TBx and 12-core TRUSBx (Group 2). Patients with only&#xD;
      positive Micro-US-TBx will receive Micro-US-TBx and 12-core TRUSBx (Group 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that the sensitivity for csPCa (defined as prostate cancer with Gleason&#xD;
      score ≥ 3+4) of Micro-US will be superior or at least equal to that of mpMRI. Despite the&#xD;
      introduction of the mpMRI and MRI-TBx has improved the diagnostic pathway of PCa, the&#xD;
      proportion of men with negative mpMRI with a csPCa is still difficult to delineate due to the&#xD;
      high variability of mpMRI negative predictive value (NPV) and specificity. In this context, a&#xD;
      specific standardization of the use of Micro-US may play a crucial role to optimize PCa&#xD;
      diagnostic pathway. Moreover, a direct comparison between Micro-US and mpMRI might be useful&#xD;
      to determinate whether Micro-US could be more accurate than mpMRI for PCa diagnosis.&#xD;
      Furthermore, in patients with suspicion of PCa the combined use between mpMRI and Micro-US&#xD;
      might increase the detection of csPCa and reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies,&#xD;
      improving mpMRI limitations in NPV and specificity. Demonstrating that Micro-US provides a&#xD;
      similar sensitivity for csPCa as compared to mpMRI may lead to its definitive inclusion in&#xD;
      daily clinical practice, potentially replacing mpMRI, streamlining the current diagnostic&#xD;
      pathway of PCa.&#xD;
