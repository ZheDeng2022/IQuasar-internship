      This a multi-center, open label, non-comparative, study that will evaluate the clinical&#xD;
      safety and performance of Exufiber Ag+ and Exufiber dressings, separately, when used as&#xD;
      intended in moderate to high exuding partial thickness burns (PTBs) through assessment of&#xD;
      wound progression from baseline to the Subject's last clinical follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sixty-eight (68) eligible subjects, with moderate to high exuding partial-thickness burns,&#xD;
      will be selected for treatment with either Exufiber Ag+ silver-coated gelling dressing, or&#xD;
      Exufiber gelling dressing. The study will last 5 weeks, with a requirement of 5 study visits&#xD;
      in total, including dressing changes at each study visit.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center study taking place in the United States, and conducted at 3-4&#xD;
      sites/locations. It is designed as an open, non-comparative study to test the safety and&#xD;
      performance of Exufiber Ag+ and Exufiber in managing burn healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the clinical safety and performance of all&#xD;
      study dressings, separately, when used as intended in moderate to high exuding partial&#xD;
      thickness burns (PTBs) through assessment of wound progression from baseline to the Subject's&#xD;
      last clinical follow-up visit. The dressings are intended to promote healing through the&#xD;
      management of the wound environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sixty-eight (68) subjects with partial thickness burns will be treated with either Exufiber&#xD;
      Ag+ (34 subjects) or Exufiber (34 subjects) primary dressings, at the discretion of the&#xD;
      Investigator. Secondary dressings should be non-adherent, non-antimicrobial dressings (local&#xD;
      treatment praxis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each Subject will be evaluated at five (5) planned study visits for a maximum total treatment&#xD;
      period of up to 21 days, unless the burn heals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1 is a baseline visit to enroll Subjects and determine burn extent. Each Subject will&#xD;
      be assigned to either Exufiber Ag+ or Exufiber primary dressings and treated according to the&#xD;
      Instructions for Use (IFU) and the local clinical routine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2 is a Confirmation Visit at up to 3 days, where the Investigator will confirm the burn&#xD;
      meets study eligibility, and has not progressed to a full-thickness burn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits 3, 4, and 5 are follow-up visits at days 7, 14, and 21, respectively, from the date of&#xD;
      the primary dressing application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each follow-up visit the Subject will return to the clinic for evaluation and primary&#xD;
      dressing change. Wound progression will be determined by the Investigator at each study visit&#xD;
      and measured by three outcome variables (Deteriorated, No Change, Improved). Images of the&#xD;
      wound at each follow up visit will be analyzed to determine changes in wound size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints will be collected identically at each visit at each clinical site to&#xD;
      assess safety and performance of the dressings. The secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate time to discontinuation of study dressings from baseline to the last&#xD;
           clinical follow-up visit, up to 21 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate clinical outcomes of the study wound from baseline to the last clinical&#xD;
           visit up to 21 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate epithelization from baseline to the last clinical follow-up visit up to 21&#xD;
           days based on digital photo imaging software measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate a change in wound size from baseline to the last clinical follow-up visit up&#xD;
           to 21 days based on digital photo and imaging software measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate healing status, including exudate levels, infection status, and proportion&#xD;
           of burn healed, by clinician's visual judgement, at Confirmation Visit (up to 72 hours)&#xD;
           and at each clinic follow-up visit, up to 21 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate Subject-reported pain at application, during wear, and at dressing changes&#xD;
           through questionnaires at each clinic follow-up visit up to 21 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate treatment and dressing selections, including type and quantity, at&#xD;
           application and at each clinic follow-up visit up to 21 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate clinician handling of the dressing at application and at every dressing&#xD;
           change performed at the clinic, from baseline and at each follow-up visit up to 21 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate clinician assessment of the dressing at application and at every dressing&#xD;
           change performed at the clinic, from baseline and at each follow-up visit up to 21 days.&#xD;
