  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective is to investigate the feasibility of a newly developed manualised group&#xD;
      Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) programme for anxiety in 15 teenagers (aged 13-17 years)&#xD;
      with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Our aim is to focus primarily on acceptability and&#xD;
      compliance with the program with some investigation of treatment effects on anxiety diagnosis&#xD;
      and anxiety symptoms.&#xD;

    <measure>Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for DSM-IV: Parent &amp; Child interview schedule (ADIS C/P)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline interview results at 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>ADIS/CP is a structured interview involving both child and parents designed to assess for current episodes of anxiety disorders, and to permit differential diagnosis among the anxiety disorders according to DSM-IV criteria.&#xD;
With the interview the disorders are rated with a clinical severity rating (CSR) from 0 (no interference) to 8 (extreme interference) with severity ratings of 4 or above signifying the presence of a clinical disorder.</description>

    <measure>Spence Children's Anxiety Scale (SCAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline results at 14 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>SCAS is a questionnaire for children and parents assessing the severity of anxiety symptoms broadly in line with the dimensions of anxiety disorder proposed by the DSM-IV. The scale assesses six domains of anxiety including generalized anxiety, panic/agoraphobia, social phobia, separation anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder and physical injury fears.&#xD;
The items are rated on a 4 point scale: 'never','sometimes', 'often', or 'always' to indicate how often each of the items happens. A higher score means worsen of the symptom. Youth version: Min. score 0, max score 135. Parent version: Min. score 0, max score 117</description>
