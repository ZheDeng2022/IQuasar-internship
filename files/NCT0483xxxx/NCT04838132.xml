  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An emerging regional block technique, transverse thoracic muscle block covers the T2-T6&#xD;
      intercostal nerves and can effectively relieve perioperative pain during median sternotomy.&#xD;
      Bilateral transverse thoracic muscle plane( TTP) block is expected to be a new analgesic mode&#xD;
      in perioperative of cardiac surgery via sternotomy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel controlled clinical trial. Eighty&#xD;
      patients planning to undergo coronary artery bypass grafting or heart valve surgery via&#xD;
      median sternotomy were randomly assigned 1:1 to the experimental group or control group.&#xD;
      After general anesthesia, all subjects were injected with 0.3% ropivacaine (experimental&#xD;
      group) or 0.9% normal saline (control group) 15ml and 10ml respectively after insertion of a&#xD;
      needle into bilateral transverse thoracic muscle plane and rectus sheath guided by&#xD;
      B-ultrasound by anesthesiologist. The main outcome indicators were the threshold of incision&#xD;
      pain and the total amount of analgesics used during the operation and 48h after the&#xD;
      operation. Secondary outcome measures were as follows: postoperative VAS score, duration of&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation, days in ICU, total days of hospitalization, and hospitalization cost.&#xD;
      This study will provide evidence-based medical evidence and clinical data support for the&#xD;
      application of TTP block in cardiac surgery.&#xD;

    <description>A linear array transducer (6-13 MHz) with a sterile cover and a 22-gauge (G) block needle (KDL™, Kindly group, Shanghai, China) will be used. Place the ultrasound probe on the longitudinal plane 1 cm outside the edge of the sternum in the fourth intercostal space, and identify the T3-T4 intercostal space under ultrasound. Use the plane technique to place a 22-gauge, 80-mm needle obliquely upwards until the needle tip is located at the plane between the internal intercostal muscles and the transverse pectoralis muscle. After general anesthesia, all subjects were injected with 0.3% ropivacaine 15ml and 10ml respectively after insertion of a needle into bilateral transverse thoracic muscle plane and rectus sheath guided by B-ultrasound.</description>
