    <textblock>
      To investigate the effects of the two following interventions on somatoform patients:1. case&#xD;
      management model2. psychotherapy, based on cognitive-behavioral therapy and biofeedback&#xD;
      therapy&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with presentations of somatic symptoms and associated psychological features are&#xD;
      named as &quot;somatoform disorders&quot; in psychiatric field. Because the patients' concerns are&#xD;
      somatic distress, they often seek help in non-psychiatric clinics. However, the symptoms are&#xD;
      usually medically unexplained. This group of diagnoses can be managed from the psychiatric&#xD;
      perspective, including medications and psychotherapies. However, many patients do not receive&#xD;
      psychiatric management in current medical practice. The goal of this project is to establish&#xD;
      an association named &quot;psychosomatic center&quot; for providing comprehensive evaluations and&#xD;
      treatments to the somatoform patients. Besides the psychiatrist, a case manager, a clinical&#xD;
      psychologist, and a research assistant will be included in this association for the purposes&#xD;
      of connection, performing psychotherapy and examinations. After entering the psychosomatic&#xD;
      clinic, the investigators will routinely perform diagnostic interview, measure psychological&#xD;
      and physiological features, and arrange individualized treatment program. The investigators&#xD;
      will follow the important psychological and biological indexes every 3-6 months for building&#xD;
      a cohort. At the same time, the case manager will connect with non-psychiatric clinics for&#xD;
      ensuring the patients physical problems to be managed. The investigators expect this project&#xD;
      to enhance the quality of treatment on the patients, to reduce the excessive examinations for&#xD;
      the frequent attenders, and to improve the emotional burden of medical staffs.&#xD;
