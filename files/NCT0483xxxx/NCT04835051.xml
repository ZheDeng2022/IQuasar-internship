      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of a breastfeeding promotion&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      This was a longitudinal cohort study designed to evaluate and measure the implementation&#xD;
      processes of a breastfeeding counseling and support intervention offered to pregnant and&#xD;
      postpartum women in private health facilities in Lagos State, Nigeria. This study was&#xD;
      conducted as part of the Alive &amp; Thrive Nigeria program, implemented by FHI 360 and partners.&#xD;
      RTI led the design, implementation, and analysis for the study, with Datametrics Associates&#xD;
      Ltd. serving as the data collection partner in Nigeria. The study took place in 20 private&#xD;
      health facilities. Ten facilities were assigned to intervention and 10 to comparison based on&#xD;
      their location within the existing intervention and comparison local government areas (LGAs)&#xD;
      for our overall impact evaluation of the Alive &amp; Thrive program in Nigeria (NCT02975063). To&#xD;
      be included in the study, facilities had to provide maternity and pediatric services, such as&#xD;
      antenatal care, postnatal care, and immunizations, and be registered with the Association of&#xD;
      General and Private Medical Practitioners of Nigeria and the Health Facility Monitoring and&#xD;
      Accreditation Agency. To ensure that the investigators would achieve their sample size,&#xD;
      selected facilities with a monthly average of ≥40 antenatal clients and ≥20 deliveries over 3&#xD;
      months. All eligible women attending antenatal care on the days of data collection were&#xD;
      invited to participate until the target enrollment at each facility was achieved. The&#xD;
      investigators collected survey data from a cohort of 1,200 women (600 per study arm) during&#xD;
      the third trimester of pregnancy and when their child was 6 weeks and 24 weeks. The purpose&#xD;
      of the surveys were to obtain data on the women's breastfeeding intentions (third trimester)&#xD;
      and practices (6 weeks and 24 weeks), their breastfeeding knowledge and attitudes, and their&#xD;
      exposure to the intervention. To measure implementation outcomes, the investigators conducted&#xD;
      180 observations of client-provider interactions among a subset of women enrolled in the&#xD;
      study and then completed a short exit interview with the women immediately after their&#xD;
      facility visit. In addition, the investigators conducted qualitative interviews with 20&#xD;
      health providers and facility managers/owners in the intervention facilities at the end of&#xD;
      the intervention to learn about the facilitators and barriers to implementation.&#xD;

The health workers also offered a mobile phone support component for appointment reminders, breastfeeding SMS and WhatsApp messages, WhatsApp breastfeeding support groups, informational materials (posters and foldable pocket-sized cards), and family engagement activities. Breastfeeding-related mass media through television and radio spots was available state-wide, including to women in intervention and comparison facilities.</description>
