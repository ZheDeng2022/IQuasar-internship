      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the experimental immunotherapy agent cemiplimab-rwlc&#xD;
      when given after completion of chemotherapy and radiation treatment and determine if it will&#xD;
      improve progression free survival and cure rates in patients with PD-L1 positive locally&#xD;

    <measure>Progression-Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the elapsed time from the date of starting maintenance treatment until disease progression or death (whichever occurs first). Patients who have not had an event will be censored at the date of last disease assessment documenting the patient was free of progression. Progression will be assessed using the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1.</description>

    <description>PFS is defined as the elapsed time from the date of starting maintenance treatment until disease progression or death (whichever occurs first). Patients who have not had an event will be censored at the date of last disease assessment documenting the patient was free of progression.

    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival (OS) will be defined as the elapsed time from the date of starting maintenance treatment (Cycle 1 Day 1) until death. Alive patients will be censored at the date of last known to be alive.</description>
