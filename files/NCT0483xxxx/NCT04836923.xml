  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Frailty is a significant problem in patients undergoing liver transplant and is associated&#xD;
      with poor outcomes and survival. Hence, optimizing physical fitness and counteracting frailty&#xD;
      is important. However, many interventions are very resource intensive and therefore not&#xD;
      feasible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators aim to test the effectiveness of a newly designed&#xD;
      intervention to improve frailty in liver transplant candidates. The &quot;LIver FrailTy&quot;&#xD;
      intervention (LIFT) will consist of an evaluation by a physical therapist, an individualized&#xD;
      home exercise prescription (HEP), exercise tracking using a smart phone application, daily&#xD;
      text reminders to exercise and recurrent telephone check-ins. The investigators also aim to&#xD;
      perform &quot;Realistic Effort Action Planning&quot; (REAP), which is a form of personality-informed&#xD;
      motivational interviewing, in a subset of patients to determine if this enhances the LIFT&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Frailty is defined as a biologic syndrome of decreased physiologic reserve and increased&#xD;
      vulnerability to health stressors. The concept of frailty has recently emerged as a critical&#xD;
      determinant in the field of cirrhosis and liver transplantation. Frailty impacts pre- and&#xD;
      post-transplant clinical outcomes, including waitlist mortality, post-transplant mortality,&#xD;
      frequency of hospitalizations and duration of hospital admissions. Although the impact of&#xD;
      frailty in liver transplantation has been established in the literature, there is a lack of&#xD;
      data supporting effective interventions to decrease frailty prior to liver transplantation.&#xD;
      Moreover, the studies that have tested interventions to improve physical function have relied&#xD;
      on frequent supervised physical therapy sessions and access to exercise equipment that it is&#xD;
      not financially or logistically feasible for the majority of patients. Patient engagement in&#xD;
      PT also remains a critical barrier to overcome to decrease frailty in preparation for liver&#xD;
      transplantation. Developing a practical and effective intervention to consistently engage&#xD;
      patients in physical activity and decrease frailty is essential to improving clinical&#xD;
      outcomes in the pre- and post-liver transplant setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators goal is to pilot test a novel PT intervention to decrease frailty in&#xD;
      pre-transplant patients. The investigators have designed a prototype &quot;LIver FrailTy&quot;&#xD;
      intervention (LIFT) that includes: PT evaluation, an individualized home exercise&#xD;
      prescription (HEP), daily text message reminders to exercise and weekly telephone check-ins&#xD;
      with team members. The investigators will also employ &quot;Realistic Effort Action Planning&quot;&#xD;
      (REAP), a form of personality-informed motivational interviewing in a subset of patients to&#xD;
      potentially enhance patient engagement and adherence to the home-exercise prescription.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The central hypothesis is that the LIFT (+/- REAP) intervention will 1) improve adherence to&#xD;
      recommended levels of exercise in end-stage liver disease 2) reduce pre-transplant frailty&#xD;
      and 3) will improve pre- and post-transplant clinical outcomes.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Every month for up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Frailty is described as a biologic syndrome of decreased physiologic reserve and increased vulnerability to health stressors. This outcome is measured by the Liver frailty index [LFI]. LFI is composed of 3 performance-based tests (grip strength, chair stands, and balance). There is no data to date describing the expected range of values. Higher LFI scores indicate a higher degree of frailty.</description>

    <description>Measured by List Sort Working Memory [LSWM] test, the Flanker Inhibitory Control and Attention [FICA], and Pattern Comparison Processing Speed Test (PCPS).&#xD;
LSWM consists of several trials wherein complementary visual and audio stimuli, presented one at a time, and participants are asked to repeat the items in order of size from smallest to largest. The raw score is the total number of lists repeated correctly. A higher score is associated with better outcomes.&#xD;
FICA examines patients' ability to inhibit visual attention to distractor arrows (flankers) and focus on a central stimulus arrow. The raw score is calculated from the response accuracy and response time over 40 trials. A higher score is associated with better outcomes.&#xD;
PCPS assesses choice reaction time by asking patients to determine whether two visual patterns are identical by &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot;. The raw score is the total correct responses out of 130. A higher score is associated with better outcomes.</description>
