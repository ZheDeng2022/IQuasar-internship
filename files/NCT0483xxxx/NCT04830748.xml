  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare between therapeutic exercises and therapeutic&#xD;
      exercises preceded by mechanical traction in treatment of patients with primary knee&#xD;
      osteoarthritis attributed to the outcomes of pain, muscle strength, functional disability and&#xD;
      functional performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. There will be no significant difference between therapeutic exercises and therapeutic&#xD;
           exercises preceded by mechanical traction on reduction of knee pain severity in patients&#xD;
           with primary knee osteoarthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. There will be no significant difference between therapeutic exercises and therapeutic&#xD;
           exercises preceded by mechanical traction on reduction of functional disability in&#xD;
           patients with primary knee osteoarthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. There will be no significant difference between therapeutic exercises and therapeutic&#xD;
           exercises preceded by mechanical traction on increasing isometric quadriceps muscle&#xD;
           strength in patients with primary knee osteoarthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. There will be no significant difference between therapeutic exercises and therapeutic&#xD;
           exercises preceded by mechanical traction on increasing isometric hamstring muscle&#xD;
           strength in patients with primary knee osteoarthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. There will be no significant difference between therapeutic exercises and therapeutic&#xD;
           exercises preceded by mechanical traction on decreasing walking time in patients with&#xD;
           primary knee osteoarthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. There will be no significant difference between therapeutic exercises and therapeutic&#xD;
           exercises preceded by mechanical traction on decreasing ascending and descending stairs&#xD;
           time in patients with primary knee osteoarthritis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Knee osteoarthritis is the most common cause of musculoskeletal pain and disability,&#xD;
      resulting in major disability and pain in affected individuals. It is a chronic degenerative&#xD;
      disorder of multifactorial aetiology, including acute and/or chronic insults from normal wear&#xD;
      and tear, age, obesity and joint injury. It nearly affects about one in each eight adults&#xD;
      worldwide, its prevalence rates vary from 7.8 to 9.3% in Egyptian population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current clinical guidelines recommend non pharmacological conservative strategies including&#xD;
      physical therapy given their ease of application and relatively low cost with minimal adverse&#xD;
      effects (e.g.: strengthening exercises, aerobic exercises, stretching exercises,&#xD;
      hydrotherapy, manual therapy, massage therapy, thermotherapy, electrotherapy, ultrasound&#xD;
      therapy, external support braces and taping).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was reported that therapeutic exercise is beneficial for patients with knee osteoarthritis&#xD;
      in terms of outcomes of pain, function, performance and quality of life. In addition, it was&#xD;
      reported that strengthening, flexibility and neuromotor skill exercises have a large efficacy&#xD;
      over aerobic and mind body exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unloading strategies should be proposed as a first line of therapy for the patient with knee&#xD;
      osteoarthritis before any attempts are made at tissue regeneration, repair or replacement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Manual or mechanical knee joint distraction is a conservative technique that provides&#xD;
      transient joint separation and unloading that aids in improving clinical symptoms of&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Addition of mechanical knee distraction to therapeutic exercises helps in gaining the&#xD;
      positive effects of both exercise and unloading techniques. Although this approach has not&#xD;
      been used extensively or applied pragmatically, several studies were found showing promising&#xD;
      results in terms of reducing pain at both rest and movement, improving knee flexion and&#xD;
      extension range of motion, reducing disability, increasing functional abilities and improving&#xD;
      the quality of life of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty male and female patients with the diagnosis of primary knee osteoarthritis will be&#xD;
      recruited in this study. All patients will be assessed and treated in the outpatient clinic&#xD;
      of the faculty of physical therapy, Cairo University. Patients will be randomly distributed&#xD;
      into 2 equal experimental groups: the first experimental group will receive therapeutic&#xD;
      exercises (stretching and strengthening exercise) while the second experimental group will&#xD;
      receive mechanical traction of the knee followed by therapeutic exercises. All patients will&#xD;
      be treated for 12 sessions, 3 times per week each other day for 4 weeks. Clinical assessments&#xD;
      will include assessment of pain severity, functional disability, isometric muscle strength,&#xD;
      and functional performance.&#xD;

    <description>Continuous knee joint mechanical traction will be applied to the patients positioned in supine lying position with the affected knee flexed at 25-30 degrees by a wedge placed under the affected knee. The thigh will be secured with a strap for stabilization and the leg will be held by the specially designed greave with the weight of traction hanging throughout a pulley system. The amount of traction will be set to about 10% of body weight. The treatment will be applied for 20 minutes continuously, once a day, 3 times per week for 4 weeks. The traction force will be progressed gradually during the program ( e.g.: weekly increase force by 1% of body weight if the patient can tolerate the duration of 20 min with the preset force).</description>

    <description>Therapeutic exercises will be divided into stretching and strengthening exercises:&#xD;
Stretching will be done passively for the hamstring, rectus femoris and calf muscles. Each exercise will be done for 3 reps each with a hold period of 30-60 secs with a 30-60 rest period between reps.&#xD;
Strengthening exercises will be done for the quadriceps and hamstring muscles ( inner range knee extension- knee extension in sitting- straight leg raise in flexion- prone hamstring curl- standing hamstring curl- straight leg raise in extension). Exercise will be done for 3 sets each will consist of 10 reps with a rest period of 2-3 minutes between sets. The starting weight should be 50% of the patient's 1 RM. The end position will be held for 5 seconds. Progression will be achieved by increasing the exercise rep and intensity gradually throughout the program. E.g.: weekly increase force by 5% if patient can tolerate an increased repetition of 20 rep with the preset force.</description>
