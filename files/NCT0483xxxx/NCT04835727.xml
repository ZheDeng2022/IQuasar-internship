  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the 21st century, the incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) globally increases.&#xD;
      Higher incidence of IBD development may implicate that environmental factors played essential&#xD;
      roles in IBD pathogenesis. One of the environmental factors is a westernized diet that&#xD;
      contains a high amount of animal protein and a low amount of dietary fiber. This kind of diet&#xD;
      can lead to gut microbial dysbiosis and increase susceptibility to IBD. A microbial dysbiosis&#xD;
      pattern in IBD is a decrease in microbial diversity and the inversed ratio of local&#xD;
      protective and pathologic bacteria. High animal protein was associated with an increased risk&#xD;
      of IBD and increased risk of disease relapse meanwhile dietary fiber was associated with IBD&#xD;
      risk reduction. A semi-vegetarian diet is a diet with high fiber and low red meat and&#xD;
      processed food that may reduce inflammatory activity in IBD. The study in the semi-vegetarian&#xD;
      diet in IBD activity is still limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aimed to evaluate a semi-vegetarian diet's effect in maintaining IBD remission in&#xD;
      disease quiescence patients.&#xD;

      This study is a prospective interventional cohort in clinically quiescence IBD patients in&#xD;
      Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand. At enrollment, clinical information,&#xD;
      dietary intake, inflammatory markers, and fecal microbiota will be recorded. Dietary intake&#xD;
      will be assessed by an experienced nutritionist using pictures of food, a dietary&#xD;
      questionnaire, and patient interviewing. The nutritionist advises the participants to consume&#xD;
      a semi-vegetarian diet which includes high dietary fiber consumption and low red meat and&#xD;
      processed food consumption. All patients will be required to send all pictures of food intake&#xD;
      three days in 1 week before every visit, including two weekdays and one weekend. The dietary&#xD;
      component will be analyzed using Nutrient calculation computer software INMUCAL-Nutrient V3&#xD;
      database NB1 (Institute of Nutrition, Mahidol University. Nakornpathom. 2013). The study will&#xD;
      take 1 year including 6 visits (including baseline, 6th weeks, 18th week, 30th week, 42nd&#xD;
      week, 54th week) for each patient. The primary outcome is the effect of increasing fiber&#xD;
      diets and decreasing red meat and processed food on maintaining clinical remission in IBD.&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes are the effect of modifying diet on change of inflammatory markers,&#xD;
      microbiota, and quality of life.&#xD;

The clinical Mayo Score for ulcerative colitis ranges from 0 to 9, a higher score means a worse outcome, and clinical relapse is defined if the score is at least 2 points.</description>
