  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our study is the first multicenter study in Vietnam on clinical phenotypes of heart failure&#xD;
      with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) in patients with concurrent type 2 diabetes (T2DM)&#xD;
      and hypertension (HTN). The purpose of this study is to identify different phenotypes of the&#xD;
      Vietnamese HFpEF-HTN-T2DM population, as well as the association of these phenotypes with&#xD;
      long-term outcomes.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is expected to provide further understanding on the characteristics, risk profiles&#xD;
      and treatment patterns of an emergingly common and high-risk population. At baseline,&#xD;
      patients will be grouped into phenotypes. During the 12 month follow up, investigators will&#xD;
      collect information on predefined outcomes, especially the all cause mortality and&#xD;
      hospitalization for heart failure, thereby establishing the association between phenotypes&#xD;
      and outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The knowledge gained from the study is supposed to add valuable information on the&#xD;
      feasibility of phenotype-guided approach for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction&#xD;
      in patients with hypertension and diabetes.&#xD;
