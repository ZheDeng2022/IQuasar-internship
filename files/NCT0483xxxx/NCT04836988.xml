  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare outcomes of two different delivery methods (Face-to-face and&#xD;
      digitally) of first-line treatment for hip and knee osteoarthritis.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to international guidelines, exercise and education should constitute the&#xD;
      first-line intervention for people with knee and hip osteoarthritis (OA) and have been shown&#xD;
      to be effective in reducing OA symptoms regardless of disease severity. To implement those&#xD;
      guidelines, the Better Management of Patients with OsteoArthritis (BOA), a face-to-face&#xD;
      concept including education and an option to exercise, has been developed and are offered at&#xD;
      primary care clinics in Sweden since 2008. However, traditional face to face interventions&#xD;
      present barriers, such as limited access and lack of flexibility, which may limit the&#xD;
      patients' adherence with the interventions. In an effort to overcome such barriers, a digital&#xD;
      self-management program (Joint Academy) that is based on the BOA concept started in 2014.&#xD;
      Although, both delivering methods have been reported to reduce OA symptoms in patients with&#xD;
      hip and/or knee OA, little is known whether the results of digital interventions are&#xD;
      comparable with traditional face-to-face rehabilitation programs. In this retrospective&#xD;
      register-based study we will compare the outcomes of the two different modalities of&#xD;
      first-line treatment delivery (face-to-face vs digitally) after 3 months program&#xD;
      participation using data from the BOA and Joint Academy registers. Main outcome will be&#xD;
      self-reported change in pain between baseline and three months follow-up and secondary&#xD;
      outcomes will be change in self-reported walking difficulties, willingness for joint surgery&#xD;
      and health-related quality of life between baseline and three months follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis In this study we will include all participants in the digital program&#xD;
      fulfilling the eligibility criteria outlined below (n &gt;2000). These participants will be&#xD;
      matched 1:1 to participants in the BOA register using the propensity scoring approach. The&#xD;
      minimum clinically important difference is typically considered to be one unit on a 0-10 NRS&#xD;
      scale. To obtain a 95% confidence interval for the between-group difference with a width of&#xD;
      at most 0.5 units (i.e. very precise) in a sample with a typical standard deviation of 1.5,&#xD;
      with 99% probability, we will need ~630 patients in total.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will use observational data to emulate an equivalence trial comparing the effect on joint&#xD;
      pain of a digitally delivered first-line intervention and of an in-person delivered first&#xD;
      line intervention for people with OA of the hip or knee. In order to establish equivalence&#xD;
      between the interventions the pain change after the intervention should differ of less than&#xD;
      1-point on a 0-10 NRS pain scale. This cut off was selected based on previous work&#xD;
      identifying 1-point change as the MCID in people with OA. The main outcome will be analyzed&#xD;
      using a propensity score matching approach. We will estimate the propensity score using a&#xD;
      logistic regression model, in which we will regress the treatment status on the observed&#xD;
      baseline characteristics of the participants. The characteristics to include in the&#xD;
      propensity score will be selected using the disjunctive cause criteria, including factors in&#xD;
      the analysis identified as causes of treatment allocation(exposure) and/or the pain change&#xD;
      (outcome). We will use nearest neighbor matching to select controls (BOA participants) whose&#xD;
      propensity score is closest to that of the treated subject. Furthermore, we will use an&#xD;
      optimal matching strategy to minimize the total within-pair difference of the propensity&#xD;
      score. Within-pair differences in main outcome will be analysed using a paired t-test.&#xD;
      Finally, we will adjust the analysis for baseline pain in order to increase the precision of&#xD;
      the estimates and minimize the regression to the mean effect&#xD;
