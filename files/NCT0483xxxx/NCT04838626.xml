  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic performance of [18F]CTT1057 as a PET&#xD;
      imaging agent for detection and localization of PSMA positive tumors using histopathology as&#xD;
      Standard of Truth (SoT). Tissue specimens from both the primary tumor and pelvic lymph nodes&#xD;
      dissected during surgery from patients with newly-diagnosed high-risk prostate cancer (PCa)&#xD;
      will be used for the histopathology assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 195 participants will be enrolled to ensure that at least 156 participants&#xD;
      complete the [18F]CTT1057 PET/CT scan procedure (i.e. investigational imaging agent&#xD;
      administration and successful completion of the PET/CT scan), which will be required for the&#xD;
      calculation of the co-primary endpoints.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, single-arm, open-label prospective study to evaluate the diagnostic&#xD;
      performance of [18F]CTT1057 as a PET imaging agent for detection and localization of PSMA&#xD;
      positive tumors, using histopathology as SoT. Tissue specimens from both the primary tumor&#xD;
      and pelvic lymph nodes dissected during surgery from patients with newly-diagnosed high-risk&#xD;
      PCa will be used for the histopathology assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive [18F]CTT1057 for PET/CT scan imaging, and surgery (radical&#xD;
      prostatectomy and extended pelvis lymph node dissection) will be performed up to 6 weeks&#xD;
      after [18F]CTT1057 PET for pathology assessment of the tissue specimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The co-primary endpoints of patient-level sensitivity and region-level specificity will be&#xD;
      assessed by comparing the central reading results of the [18F]CTT1057 PET scan to the&#xD;
      histopathology results in the dissected tissue specimens, i.e. both the primary tumor and the&#xD;
      dissected Pelvic Lymph Node (PLN)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pathology will be assessed by the local pathologists as per Standard of Care (SoC), who will&#xD;
      be blinded to the PET data.&#xD;
