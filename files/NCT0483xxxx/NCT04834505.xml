  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) is a special type of chronic pancreatitis mediated by&#xD;
      autoimmunity. The classic manifestation of AIP is diffuse pancreatic enlargement, some of&#xD;
      which are characterized by focal enlargement. Clinically, it is divided into diffuse AIP&#xD;
      (DAIP) and focal AIP (FAIP) according to morphology. FAIP can be clinically manifested as&#xD;
      obstructive jaundice, peripancreatic lymphadenopathy and vascular involvement, which may&#xD;
      mimic pancreatic cancer (PC). CT/MRI is the important imaging tool for diagnosing pancreatic&#xD;
      diseases. However, due to the overlap of the imaging features of FAIP and PC, it is&#xD;
      challenging to differentiate the two by CT/MRI. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) can clearly&#xD;
      display the pancreatic parenchyma and pancreatic duct system and has become a routine&#xD;
      modality for the evaluation of pancreatic diseases. The aim of this study is to construct a&#xD;
      diagnosis model for distinguishing between FAIP and PC by comparing the EUS characteristics&#xD;
      of the two, and further validate its diagnostic efficacy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A derivation sample is established by retrospectively collecting the EUS images of about 100&#xD;
      FAIP patients and about 200 PC patients who were diagnosed for the first time in Peking Union&#xD;
      Medical College Hospital in the past 6 years and underwent EUS at the same time. The&#xD;
      parenchymal and ductal changes of pancreas were defined according to the Rosemont criteria.&#xD;
      The parenchymal characteristics included hyperechoic foci/strands and lobularity, and the&#xD;
      ductal changes included main pancreatic duct (MPD) dilation. Other EUS characteristics not&#xD;
      included in the conventional criteria were described based on the literatures, including&#xD;
      pancreatic diffuse hypoechogenicity, focal hypoechogenicity, pancreatic diffuse enlargement,&#xD;
      focal enlargement, peripancreatic hypoechoic margin, common bile duct (CBD) dilation, bile&#xD;
      duct wall thickening, lymphadenopathy and vessel involvement. The EUS characteristics of the&#xD;
      two groups of patients are included in the multivariate stepwise logistic regression and&#xD;
      receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analyses to construct a differential diagnosis model&#xD;
      in derivation sample. Further, the differential diagnosis model will be prospectively&#xD;
      validated by calculating the sensitivity and specificity in about 90 patients who are going&#xD;
      to undergo EUS due to the difficulty in distinguishing between FAIP and PC. Diagnosis of AIP&#xD;
      meets the revised Mayo clinic criteria (revised HISORt criteria) including features of&#xD;
      histology, imaging, serology, other organs involvement and response to steroid therapy.&#xD;
      Diagnosis of pancreatic duct adenocarcinoma is confirmed by surgical pathology or by&#xD;
      cytology/histology after EUS-guided fine needle aspiration or biopsy.&#xD;
