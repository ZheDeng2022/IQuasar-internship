      To observe the efficacy and safety of a new generation of BTK inhibitor Orelabrutinib&#xD;

      This study includes a dose escalation phase and an extended treatment phase . The&#xD;
      dose-escalation phase： Primary study endpoint: Safety endpoint: including dose-limiting&#xD;
      toxicity (DLT), adverse events, ECOG performance score, laboratory tests, vital signs,&#xD;
      physical examination .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary research endpoints: effectiveness endpoints: including complete response rate&#xD;
      (CRR), objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival&#xD;
      (PFS), and overall survival (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study adopts the &quot;3+3&quot; design, that is, 3-6 subjects in each group complete the&#xD;
      administration, and the dose group determined as the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is included&#xD;
      in the group of 6 subjects, totaling 9-18 example. The dose planned to be explored is the&#xD;
      daily oral dose of the BTK inhibitor abutinib, which is 100 mg, 150 mg and 200 mg,&#xD;
      respectively. The doses of other drugs in the plan will not be escalated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the last subject in each dose group completes the 28-day restricted toxicity (DLT)&#xD;
      assessment window after the administration, the investigator can start the entry into the&#xD;
      next dose group after evaluating and agreeing to enter the next dose group based on clinical&#xD;
      safety data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When 1 case of DLT occurs among 3 subjects in a certain dose group, 3 subjects need to be&#xD;
      added to the same dose group (6 subjects in this dose group complete the DLT assessment): If&#xD;
      the additional 3 subjects are tested If there is no DLT, continue the dose escalation; if 1&#xD;
      of the 3 increased subjects has DLT, stop the dose escalation; if the increased 3 subjects&#xD;
      have &gt;1 of the subjects DLT, the dose escalation is stopped, and the dose needs to be lowered&#xD;
      to continue to enroll 3 subjects for DLT evaluation. If DLT occurs in 2 of the 3 or 6&#xD;
      subjects in the dose group, then the previous low dose is defined as the maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose (MTD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The extended treatment phase :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary study endpoints: objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR),&#xD;
      progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints: time to disease progression (TTP), median survival (MST), adverse&#xD;
      reactions (ADR), quality of life (QOL) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study adopts an open, one-arm, prospective clinical collaborative study . The initial&#xD;
      treatment is BTK inhibitor (Obutinib), PD-1 monoclonal antibody combined with formustine&#xD;
      ：Orelabrutinib continues to be taken orally until the tumor is relieved for 3 months; PD-1&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody is used by intravenous drip, 21 days as a treatment cycle, and a total of&#xD;
      1 year of observation; formustine is used by intravenous drip for 21 days It is a treatment&#xD;
      cycle, a total of 6 cycles of observation; after 2 cycles, the efficacy is evaluated, and&#xD;
      adverse reactions are recorded. At the same time, MTX 12mg+Ara-C 50mg+Dex 5mg was injected&#xD;
      into the CSF cytology-positive sheath, and intrathecal injection once per treatment cycle, a&#xD;
      total of 6 times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second stage treatment ：The efficacy was evaluated after 6 cycles of treatment in the initial&#xD;
      stage. The CR patients continued to take orally abutinib (150mg, qd) for three months, and&#xD;
      the PD-1 monoclonal antibody was used for maintenance treatment for up to 1 year; the PR&#xD;
      patients received whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT), and at the same time Continue oral&#xD;
      obritinib (150mg, qd) for three months and PD-1 monoclonal antibody maintenance treatment for&#xD;
      up to one year; SD and PD patients choose methotrexate + pemetrexed combined chemotherapy for&#xD;
      4 cycles followed by whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT). WBRT: Regardless of age, supplementary&#xD;
      WBRT 30-36Gy + partial reduction field irradiation up to 45Gy.&#xD;
