  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to develop imaging methods to diagnose placental injury&#xD;
      in pregnancies diagnosed with fetal growth restriction (FGR). Investigators are doing this&#xD;
      research because the use of IV iron, followed by a Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), may help&#xD;
      detect injury in the placenta. The IV iron, ferumoxytol, is an iron preparation used for&#xD;
      treatment of iron deficiency anemia. It is given in hospital setting under close medical&#xD;
      attention. Ferumoxytol(FE) is FDA approved for some uses, but in pregnant women, its use as a&#xD;
      MRI contrast is investigational.&#xD;

      Research Procedure Descriptions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood/urine collection for research Blood and urine samples are collected at the consenting&#xD;
      visit and at the time of delivery. A total of 10 mL, of blood is collected via venipuncture&#xD;
      along with an aliquot of a urine sample. For research visits that coincide with clinical&#xD;
      visits, research blood samples are collected in conjunction with clinical samples, saving&#xD;
      subjects an additional needle stick. All subjects are asked if they wish to have left over&#xD;
      research samples banked for future unspecified research. Blood and urine samples will be&#xD;
      analyzed to monitor relevant maternal growth factors, multiplex assays for Cytokine panel and&#xD;
      Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Urine will be tested for Shed VE-Cadherin (VE Cad).&#xD;
&#xD;
      60 minute MRI: This MRI scan will take approximately 60 minutes. Prior to entering the MR&#xD;
      suite, subjects are screened again for MRI safety and compatibility. The MR imaging exam is&#xD;
      expected to take approximately 60 minutes with some additional time to get subjects&#xD;
      comfortably placed in the scanner. Subjects are made as comfortable as possible in the bore&#xD;
      and are provided with an alarm, which allows them to get the attention of the MR technologist&#xD;
      conducting the scan. There is a break between scans to ensure the comfort of the subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ferumoxytol administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MRI imaging with ferumoxytol as a contrast agent will be conducted at the scheduled&#xD;
      visits based on timing of FGR diagnosis. Ferumoxytol will be administered in a hospital&#xD;
      triage setting with maternal pulse and blood pressure monitoring and fetal heart rate&#xD;
      monitoring. The pharmacy will be notified in advance of the arrival of the participant, so&#xD;
      that they can prepare the infusion in a timely fashion and deliver it to triage upon&#xD;
      participant's arrival. Participants will arrive at UnityPoint-Health Meriter Hospital&#xD;
      obstetric triage unit as prescheduled for ferumoxytol infusion. Later that same day, the&#xD;
      participants will present to the University of Wisconsin (UW) Hospital, Wisconsin Institutes&#xD;
      for Medical Research (WIMR) or 1 S. Park location for their pre-scheduled MRI. In the triage&#xD;
      unit, the nurse will obtain baseline vital signs, including maternal pulse, blood pressure,&#xD;
      and fetal heart rate. Following this, the nurse will initiate an infusion dose of&#xD;
      ferumoxytol. Ferumoxytol will be administered intravenously, by infusion, over 30 minutes.&#xD;
      The participants will be monitored at 5 to 15-minute intervals, for pulse, blood pressure,&#xD;
      respiration, and fetal heart rate. The MRI scanning procedure will be conducted at the UW&#xD;
      Hospital, WIMR or 1 S. Park location for approximately 60 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recommended dose of Feraheme is an initial 510 mg dose followed by a second 510 mg dose 3&#xD;
      to 8 days later. Investigators plan to dilute half of the recommended initial dose, i.e. 255&#xD;
      mg in 50 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP or 5% Dextrose Injection, USP. Feraheme&#xD;
      will be given only once, in one infusion of 255 mg to each participant who has consented for&#xD;
      this study.&#xD;
