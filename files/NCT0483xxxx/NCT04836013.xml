  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective multicenter pediatric double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      parallel group clinical trial intended to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of a&#xD;
      combined probiotic (LGG and L. reuteri LMG P-27481) in the prevention of antibiotic&#xD;
      associated diarrhea and gastrointestinal symptoms in hospitalised children treated with&#xD;
      antibiotics for proven or suspected bacterial infection.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Eligible children will be randomly assigned to receive the combined probiotic study product&#xD;
      (Noos, Roma, Italia)(BCCMTM Bacterial Collection of Ghent, Belgium, Italian Patent:&#xD;
      102016000011071, International Patent Request : PCT/IB 2017/053856), or placebo as additional&#xD;
      treatment to the antibiotic therapy. Kind, dose and duration of antibiotic treatment will be&#xD;
      decided by the local clinicians according to good medical practice and current&#xD;
      recommendations. The first dose of probiotic will be started the same day of starting the&#xD;
      antibiotic treatment, immediately after enrollment. Then, each oral stick will be&#xD;
      administered orally once daily, in the morning, before breakfast, during the antibiotic&#xD;
      treatment and prolonged for 30 days since starting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study product The combined probiotic is made by Lactobacillus reuteri LMG P-27481 and&#xD;
      Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (ATCC 53103), sucralose and isomalt as an oral stick formulation&#xD;
      of 1.6 g with a concentration of probiotic of 2x1010 colony forming unit (CFU) per stick,&#xD;
      launched in the Italian market with the name of Reuterin®GG (Noos, Roma, Italia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The probiotic and placebo will be prepared centrally by the probiotic producer as identically&#xD;
      appearing oral stick. The placebo will contain only sucralose and isomalt, 1.6 g per stick.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization The allocation sequences and randomization lists has been generated by a online&#xD;
      computer system. The probiotic -placebo allocation ratio will be of 1:1. To ensure allocation&#xD;
      concealment, an independent subject prepared the randomization schedule and sealed envelopes&#xD;
      to be sent to the participant centers. Each investigator will control the packaging and&#xD;
      labels of trial treatments sent by the producer with a numerical code with no possible&#xD;
      identification of the probiotic product compared to the placebo. The allocation will be&#xD;
      consecutively assigned for all enrolled subjects. All investigators, participants, and&#xD;
      statisticians will be blinded to the assigned treatment throughout the study and during the&#xD;
      data analysis. After completing the analysis of the data or in case of sever adverse event&#xD;
      the randomization code will be broken and information about the content of the product&#xD;
      (probiotic or placebo) will be revealed by the producer, upon the investigator's request.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring and collection of data At enrollment a standardized form will record age, gender,&#xD;
      anthropometric parameters, vital signs, refilling time, site of infection, laboratory tests,&#xD;
      kind, dose and route of administration of antibiotic, diet, previous AAD or other&#xD;
      gastrointestinal symptoms, comorbidity and associated treatment. Vesikary scale,&#xD;
      anthropometric measures, vital signs, refilling time will be also recorded in each patient at&#xD;
      enrollment and in case of occurrence of diarrhea. Bristol stool chart will be used to grade&#xD;
      the consistency of stools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents or care givers of each children will be instructed to fill in a diary to record the&#xD;
      duration of antibiotic treatment and/or other treatment, the intake of the study product, the&#xD;
      frequency of daily bowel movements, the consistency of stools (according to the Bristol stool&#xD;
      scale), the frequency and intensity (according to a VAS scale, from 0 to 10) of abdominal&#xD;
      pain, the presence and duration of fever, vomiting or any other symptoms they considered&#xD;
      important, diet changes and general well being (according to a numerical 1-10 scale). The&#xD;
      diary will be completed daily for the duration of the probiotic treatment and then weekly&#xD;
      till the end of the study. After discharge from the hospital the absence from day care or&#xD;
      school, the need of new antibiotic treatment or re-hospitalization will be also noted. In&#xD;
      case of diarrhea, fever or other severe symptoms after hospital discharge parents will be&#xD;
      instructed to contact the local pediatrician and investigator for clinical evaluation and&#xD;
      stool analysis. A clinical visit will be scheduled in all recruited patients after 1, 3 and 6&#xD;
      months from enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Re-hospitalization will be required in case of severe infection, severe dehydration or&#xD;
      whenever considered necessary by clinicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scheduled investigations In all cases presenting diarrhea at least three stool samples will&#xD;
      be collected and stool tests will be performed to detect viral, bacterial or C. difficile&#xD;
      pathogens. Blood and urine test or radiologial investigations will be decided by the local&#xD;
      clinician based on patient's clinical presentation and according to guidelines and good&#xD;
      clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One additional sample of stools will be collected, whenever possible, in each patient at&#xD;
      enrollment, at 1, 3 and 6 months to evaluate fecal calprotectin to indirectly assess&#xD;
      intestinal inflammation. In a subgroup of patients (the first 30 recruited in each arms) two&#xD;
      other stool samples and a urine sample will be collected and stocked in freezer (-20° C) at&#xD;
      the same study point for possible future additional explorative analysis of fecal&#xD;
      inflammatory markers (lactoferrine, IgA, IL10 and TNF-α) and metabolomic profile (urine&#xD;
      metabolites).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The probiotic producer (Noos S.r.L, Roma, Italia) will gift the probiotic product and placebo&#xD;
      for the duration of the study for all children enrolled but has and will have no role in the&#xD;
      design and conduct of the study; collection, management, analysis, or interpretation of the&#xD;
      data; preparation, review, or approval of the manuscript; or the decision to submit the&#xD;
      manuscript for publication. The data of the enrolled subjects will be managed, stored and&#xD;
      property of the clinical investigators of the participant centers and of the coordinator&#xD;
      center and will be analysed and published anonymously and as aggregate, in the respect of the&#xD;
      current legislation on privacy.&#xD;
