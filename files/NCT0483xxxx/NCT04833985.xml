  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A total of 75 patients with atrial fibrillation were scheduled to receive left atrial&#xD;
      appendage occlusion combined with radiofrequency ablation, which were divided into 3 groups.&#xD;
      The operation was performed under the guidance of intracardiac echocardiography and&#xD;
      transesophageal echocardiography and fluoroscope only respectively (allocation ratio 1:1:1).&#xD;
      During the operation, the total amount of contrast medium injected, the fluoroscopy time and&#xD;
      the time from femoral vein puncture to transseptal puncture to closure were recorded in all&#xD;
      patients. All patients underwent transesophageal echocardiography before and 3 months after&#xD;
      operation, and the results were explained by two experienced ultrasound doctors to measure&#xD;
      the presence of left atrial thrombus, residual shunt and device-related thrombus. All&#xD;
      patients were examined by transthoracic echocardiography 3 months after operation to evaluate&#xD;
      new pericardial effusion, pericardial tamponade, instrument embolization / displacement and&#xD;
      so on. The baseline clinical and surgical features and hospitalization outcomes of patients&#xD;
      guided by ICE and TEE and fluoroscopy only were recorded and compared. Clinical endpoints&#xD;
      include death, new pericardial effusion that does not require pericardiocentesis, tamponade&#xD;
      with pericardiocentesis, instrument embolism / displacement, bleeding at the entry site,&#xD;
      thromboembolic events (stroke / transient ischemic attack [TIA]). The purpose of this study&#xD;
      was to evaluate the feasibility, safety and effectiveness of intracardiac echocardiographic&#xD;
      (ICE)-guided and transesophageal echocardiographic (TEE)-guided and fluoroscopy only-guided&#xD;
      left atrial appendage occlusion combined with radiofrequency ablation. The average follow-up&#xD;
      time is 3 months.&#xD;
