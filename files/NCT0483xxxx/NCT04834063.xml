  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) includes a wide range of disorders that consist of&#xD;
      simple fatty infiltration, steatohepatitis (NASH), and end-stage liver disease (cirrhosis).&#xD;
      NAFLD is the most common cause of chronic liver disease worldwide and increases the risk of&#xD;
      end-stage liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) . While risk factors such as&#xD;
      obesity, diabetes, and a sedentary lifestyle may increase the risk of NAFLD, studies have&#xD;
      shown that environmental exposures may further contribute to the pathogenesis of NAFLD.&#xD;
      Although the pathogenic role of macronutrients is well established in both NAFLD and obesity,&#xD;
      the contribution of micronutrients to NAFLD pathogenesis has garnered less attention than&#xD;
      with obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selenium is an essential element in many biological functions and is an important component&#xD;
      of human nutrition. Exposure to selenium can be found in nature, such as rocks and sediment,&#xD;
      air, soil, fuel oil, drinking water and nutritional supplementation. It is a major component&#xD;
      of many enzymes such as glutathione peroxidase and plays an important role in anti-oxidation,&#xD;
      DNA synthesis, reproduction, muscle function, and thyroid metabolism. Selenium concentrations&#xD;
      have been studied in many diseases and organ systems including the liver. However, the exact&#xD;
      relationship between selenium in patients with NAFLD is unclear.&#xD;

      systems including the liver. However, the exact relationship between selenium in patients&#xD;
      with NAFLD is unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite data suggesting mineral deficiencies in NAFLD patients, most data do not support&#xD;
      insufficient mineral consumption as a possible mechanism for these deficiencies, except in&#xD;
      the case of zinc deficiency. Zinc is the second most prevalent trace element in the body. It&#xD;
      is integrally involved in the normal life cycle and has many important regulatory, catalytic,&#xD;
      and defensive functions. Zinc deficiency occurs in many types of liver disease, especially&#xD;
      more advanced/decompensated disease.&#xD;

      We aim firstly to assess the serum selenium and zinc level in NAFLD patients, secondly to&#xD;
      detect the association between hepatic fibrosis, steatosis, and serum selenium level in NAFLD&#xD;
      patients, thirdly to detect if there is a synergistic effect of both molecules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Case-control study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studied population &amp; locality:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted on two groups: Group (1): include 70 patients diagnosed to has&#xD;
      NAFLD by ultrasonography presented to the outpatient clinic of Tropical medicine and&#xD;
      gastroenterology department, Sohag University Hospitals during the period from March 2021 to&#xD;
      August 2021.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group (2): a control group of 30 healthy volunteers who looks normal on ultrasonographic&#xD;
      examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any patient with a chronic liver disease rather than NAFLD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All included patients will be subjected to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Detailed history, complete general and systemic examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. BMI will be calculated as follow&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Abdominal Ultrasonography.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Laboratory investigations:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Fasting blood sugar&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Serum lipogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Liver function tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  CBC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Estimation of serum selenium and zinc level.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Liver stiffness measurements to detect the degree of fibrosis and measurement of the&#xD;
           degree of steatosis using (Fibroscan).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be approved by The Ethical committee of medical research, Sohag Faculty of&#xD;
      Medicine, Sohag University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After an explanation about the nature of the procedures, possible complications, benefits,&#xD;
      and steps of the study, all patients and controls will give written informed consent for&#xD;
      participating in the study, performing the abdominal ultrasound, taking blood samples,&#xD;
      performing fibroscan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analyzed using STATA version 12.1. Quantitative data were represented as mean,&#xD;
      standard deviation, median, and range. Data will be analyzed using a student t-test to&#xD;
      compare the means of the two groups. Qualitative data will be presented as numbers and&#xD;
      percentages and will be compared using either the Chi-square test or Fisher exact test.&#xD;
      P-value will be considered significant if it was less than 0.05.&#xD;
