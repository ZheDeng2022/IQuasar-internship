  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 dose-escalation study of PRT1419, a myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL1)&#xD;
      inhibitor, in patients with advanced solid tumors. The purpose of this study is to define the&#xD;
      dosing schedule, maximally tolerated dose and/or estimate the optimal biological dose to be&#xD;
      used in subsequent development of PRT1419.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation Phase 1 study of PRT1419, a MCL1&#xD;
      inhibitor, evaluating patients with relapsed or refractory solid tumors, including breast,&#xD;
      lung, sarcoma and melanoma as part of a 28-day treatment cycle. The study will employ a &quot;3+3&quot;&#xD;
      dose escalation design. The dose may be escalated until a dose limiting toxicity is&#xD;
      identified.&#xD;
