    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, national, multi-center, non-interventional study. The main&#xD;
      purpose is to explore the initial adjuvant treatment pattern after radical resection for&#xD;
      early-stage NSCLC patients with EGFR Mutation-Positive in the real world. The secondary&#xD;
      purpose was to observe the postoperative follow-up treatment pattern and its subgroups (based&#xD;
      on different EGFR mutation status and different clinical stages).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      About 2,000 eNSCLC patients who received radical resection from about 50 research centers&#xD;
      across the country will be included in this study, and will be followed up to 2 years after&#xD;
      enrollment according to the actual clinical situation. The analysis method of this study is&#xD;
      mainly based on descriptive statistics. The information about the human genetic resources of&#xD;
      the subjects to be collected includes: demography, physical examination, WHO fitness status,&#xD;
      medical history, smoking history, disease characteristics, surgical information, initial and&#xD;
      follow-up adjuvant treatment pattern, laboratory tests, survival status, and adverse events&#xD;
      related to gefitinib/osimertinib, serious adverse events/non-severe ADR, measures taken for&#xD;
      adverse events, outcome of adverse events.&#xD;
