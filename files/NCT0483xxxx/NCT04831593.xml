      Background and Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmonary aspiration of gastric content in the perioperative period is rare, but it is an&#xD;
      important cause of morbidity and mortality that anesthetists never want to encounter. Due to&#xD;
      reasons such as emergency surgical procedures, communication problems with pediatric patients&#xD;
      or their parents, impaired cognitive function, obesity, diabetes mellitus, chronic liver and&#xD;
      kidney diseases, it is observed that there is sometimes inconsistency between the periods&#xD;
      defined in the preoperative fasting guidelines in pediatric patients and the state of gastric&#xD;
      content and volume encountered in clinical practice. There is a lack of data on children on&#xD;
      this issue. In this study, primary we aimed to evaluate the incidence of empty and full&#xD;
      stomach in pediatric patients who underwent elective and emergency surgery in our routine&#xD;
      anesthesia practice. Also we want to determine the relationship between fasting time and&#xD;
      qualitative assessment of gastric content. Secondary this study sought to examine whether&#xD;
      correlation between gastric ultrasound finding and fasting time, and also to determine&#xD;
      relationship with the current comorbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, single blinded, observational study. The minimum sample size required&#xD;
      to determine the prevalence of full stomach, 0.05, within the limits of ± 0.025 with 0.95&#xD;
      confidence, was calculated as 292.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When calculating with the proposed equation of n = 100 + 50i to determine the factors&#xD;
      affecting by logistic regression (here i is the number of variables in the model), the&#xD;
      minimum number of samples required for logistic regression analysis was calculated as 300 in&#xD;
      case of 4 independent variables in the model. n=100+50*4= 300&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pediatric patients younger than 18 yr old who are to undergo elective and emergency surgery&#xD;
      under general anaesthesia at our hospital are enrolled in this prospective observational&#xD;
      study between April and December 2021. Preoperative ultrasound examination of the gastric&#xD;
      antrum are performed by one anesthesiologist who has been instructed and supervised by an&#xD;
      experienced pediatric radiologist and who is blind to the patient's history. Ultrasonographic&#xD;
      measurement of the gastric antral cross-sectional area (CSA) are performed in supine position&#xD;
      and right lateral decubitus position (RLD). The gastric antrum is imaged in a sagittal plane,&#xD;
      between the left lobe of the liver and the pancreas, at the level of the aorta, as previously&#xD;
      described [1]. This examination allowed qualitative assessment of gastric contents according&#xD;
      to the three-point grading scale previously described by Perlas and colleagues[2]. Grade 0&#xD;
      was defined by the absence of appearance of any content in a flat antrum in both the supine&#xD;
      and the RLD positions. Grade 1 was defined by the appearance of any gastric content in the&#xD;
      RLD position only, and Grade 2 was defined by the appearance of any content in both the RLD&#xD;
      and the supine positions. The antral cross-sectional area is also calculated in both&#xD;
      position, by measuring the longitudinal diameter (D1) and the anteroposterior diameter (D2)&#xD;
      of the antrum, from serosa to serosa using this formula [3] Antral area= (π x D1 X D2) / 4.&#xD;
      Patients' characteristic data ( age, gender, weight, height, BMI and ASA physical status&#xD;
      classification), fasting duration, type of elective and emergency surgery, chronic disease&#xD;
      and complications (regurgitation, pulmonary aspiration, etc.) that may develop during the&#xD;
      peroperative period are recorded.&#xD;
