  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A national screening program for children aged 9-18 months that will be tested for the&#xD;
      presence of islet autoantibodies.Up to 50,000 Children will be screened by their primary care&#xD;
      physician all over Israel. The initial screening will be done at the age of 1 year (in&#xD;
      conjunction with the routinely collection of blood for CBC ) and repeated at ages 2-5 years.&#xD;
      Antibodies will be measured in capillary blood samples using the Ultrasensitive Antibody&#xD;
      Detection by Agglutination-PCR (ADAP) technology developed by Enable Biosciences, which is&#xD;
      1,000-10,000 times more analytically sensitive than currently used methods. By using this&#xD;
      innovative technology in such a large cohort, the study is anticipated to detect antibodies&#xD;
      at an unprecedented earlier age.When positive in the screening, multiple antibodies will be&#xD;
      confirmed by a second sample analyzed by the ADAP technology. In addition, multiple&#xD;
      antibodies will be also measured using a radio-binding assay (RBA) of a venous blood sample&#xD;
      for investigational purpose only. Children with confirmed multiple antibodies (stage 1 or 2&#xD;
      T1D) will be followed up routinely for the appearance of clinical signs of diabetes (HbA1c,&#xD;
      repeated OGTT, monitoring of urine and blood glucose where indicated) and will be invited&#xD;
      along with their families to attend an educational program. This program will include&#xD;
      diabetes education emphasizing on DKA prevention as well as stress assessment for the&#xD;
      families involved and stress alleviating interventions. The analysis and storage of the&#xD;
      samples will be done in a single screening center at Schneider Children's Medical Center of&#xD;
      Israel.&#xD;

    <description>Presymptomatic type 1 diabetes, defined as positive for 2 or more islet autoantibodies (GADA, IA-2A, and IAA) or those with high levels of a single antibody in both the screening and confirmation samples or in the screening sample plus a diagnosis of diabetes prior to obtaining the conformation sample.&#xD;
Presymptomatic type 1 diabetes will be classified as stage 1, 2, or 3:&#xD;
Stage 1 will be defined as 2 or more islet autoantibodies or high levels of a single antibody and normal glucose tolerance based on OGTT results. (not including patients with only a single antibody who have first degree relative with type 1 diabetes)&#xD;
Stage 2 will be defined as 1 or more islet autoantibodies accompanied by dysglycemia (fasting plasma glucose of 110-125 mg/dL or impaired 2-hour plasma glucose of 140- 199 mg/dL and/or plasma glucose â‰¥200 mg/dL at intermediate time points [30, 60, 90 minutes]) based on OGTT results.&#xD;
Stage 3 will be defined according to the American Diabetes Association criteria</description>
