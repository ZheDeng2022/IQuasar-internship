  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During Laparoscopic cholecystectomy, carbon dioxide (CO2) pneumoperitoneal laparoscopic&#xD;
      surgery, CO2-pneumoperitoneum activates the sympathoadrenomedullary system to increase the&#xD;
      release of catecholamines such as epinephrine (E) norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA).&#xD;
      During stress, E and NE are secreted by the adrenal medulla into blood circulation to promote&#xD;
      glycogenolysis to increase blood glucose, speed up lipolysis and accelerate heartbeats.&#xD;
      Stellate g anglion block (SGB) reters to the blockade of sympathetic nerves including the&#xD;
      large area covered by middle cervical, vertebral arterial. stellate ganglions and ther pre-&#xD;
      and post- ganglions. SGB affects both peripheral and central nervous systems. In the&#xD;
      peripheral system. the sympathetic pre- and post-ganglionic fibers in the innervated areas of&#xD;
      stellate ganglion are affected. Therefore, the control of vascular dilatation and&#xD;
      constriction, muscular movement, bronchial smooth muscle relaxation and contraction, and pain&#xD;
      conduction, by sympathetic nerves is inhibited. In the central nervous system, the&#xD;
      hypothalamus is mainly involved in the regulation of systemic autonomic nervous, immune and&#xD;
      endocrine systems, and to maintain homeostasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CO2-pneumoperitoneum causes severe stress-related homeostatic disorders including arrhythmia&#xD;
      and blood pressure changes. This study will examine the effects of stellate ganglion block&#xD;
      (SGB) on hemodynamics and stress response in patients undergoing CO-pneumoperitoneal surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic surgery is being increasingly recognized for its advantages of minimal&#xD;
      invasiveness. mild postoperative pain, short length of hospitalization and rapid recovery and&#xD;
      is widely used in general surgery, obstetrics. gynecology and urology. Laparoscopic&#xD;
      cholecystectomy (LC) has become the gold standard for surgically treating benign diseases of&#xD;
      the gallbladder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During carbon dioxide (CO2) pneumoperitoneal laparoscopic surgery, CO2-pneumoperitoneum&#xD;
      activates the sympathoadrenomedullary system to increase the release of catecholamines such&#xD;
      as epinephrine (E) norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA). During stress, E and NE are&#xD;
      secreted by the adrenal medulla into blood circulation to promote glycogenolysis to increase&#xD;
      blood glucose, speed up lipolysis and accelerate heartbeats. Stellate g anglion block (SGB)&#xD;
      reters to the blockade of sympathetic nerves including the large area covered by middle&#xD;
      cervical, vertebral arterial. stellate ganglions and ther pre- and post- ganglions. SGB&#xD;
      affects both peripheral and central nervous systems. In the peripheral system. the&#xD;
      sympathetic pre- and post-ganglionic fibers in the innervated areas of stellate ganglion are&#xD;

    <description>The skin should be anaesthetised with lidocaine 2%. Using a lateral approach and in-plane imaging, a blunt regional anaesthesia needle should be advanced deep to the carotid sheath towards the longus colli muscle. Following careful aspiration, inject 10 ml lidocaine 2% that will result in expansion of the fascia of the longus colli. Confirmation of the SGB success can be detected by warming of left upper limb and left Horner's syndrome.</description>
