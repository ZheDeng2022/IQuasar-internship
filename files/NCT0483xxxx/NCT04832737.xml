  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the research is to develop a treatment program with positive self-awareness and&#xD;
      self-determination outcomes for adults with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).&#xD;
      Current treatments are based in a characterisation of ADHD oriented on deficits impairing&#xD;
      everyday functioning, with primary goals of symptom control and reduction. However, treatment&#xD;
      approaches are not standardised and only evidence short-term effectiveness. This project&#xD;
      proposes an alternative approach to understanding ADHD behaviours, supported by Self&#xD;
      Determination Theory (SDT). Research shows SDT based treatment approaches can support&#xD;
      engagement of intrinsic motivation and longterm integration of behavioural change. ADHD&#xD;
      research shows individuals are impaired in some contexts but not in others and can manage&#xD;
      well, indicating potential for ADHD neurodiverse &quot;strengths&quot; which could be developed and&#xD;
      supported. Recent psychology research recommends cultivating positive psychological factors&#xD;
      and emotions to improve mental health and wellbeing. Adults aged 18+ with a confirmed ADHD&#xD;
      diagnosis will be invited to participate in two projects: Intensive online interviews of 1&#xD;
      hour will be conducted to identify, explore, and construct a theory about the factors, or&#xD;
      &quot;natural strengths&quot; in lived experience of ADHD that help individuals to overcome everyday&#xD;
      impairments. These factors will be incorporated into a pilot feasibility study of an SDT&#xD;
      based 12-week treatment programme focusing on understanding the lived experience of ADHD and&#xD;
      building on these strengths. The treatment will be designed for individual participants and&#xD;
      delivered online. This study will have two sets of participants: one group will go directly&#xD;
      to treatment, the other will go on a 12-week waiting list to create a comparison group. The&#xD;
      second group will then be offered the 12-week treatment. Measures of experience of the&#xD;
      participants will be looking for the feasibility, acceptability and efficacy of this&#xD;
      treatment, as well as indicators of symptom improvement, and changes in self-awareness and&#xD;
      self-regulation skills.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ADHD symptoms negatively affect daily functioning both at work and at home, and have&#xD;
      long-term impact in academic, occupational, social and emotional areas of functioning.&#xD;
      Effective, long-term treatment outcomes benefit both the individual with ADHD and society as&#xD;
      undiagnosed and untreated adults with ADHD may become an economic burden due to increased&#xD;
      health care costs and decreased productivity at work. Russell Barkley postulated the first&#xD;
      unifying theory of ADHD which places a core deficit of behavioural inhibition at the source&#xD;
      of ADHD behaviours. Barkley's model is built upon observation of perceived chronic&#xD;
      difficulties in behaviour, measured as &quot;excessive or inappropriate for their age or&#xD;
      development level.&quot;. Since the publication of this model, several theoretical models were&#xD;
      proposed which attribute alternative cognitive sources for the development of ADHD symptoms,&#xD;
      but Barkley's model forms the foundation for primary treatment recommendations. A recent&#xD;
      review of the theories of ADHD recommended that more testable hypotheses need to be produced.&#xD;
      While a variety of different interventions are available and the benefit of other forms of&#xD;
      support is acknowledged (e.g. psychotherapy or coaching), the National Institute for Health&#xD;
      and Care Excellence (NICE) only recommends interventions that match a similar protocol to&#xD;
      medications: Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs), which are primarily based in Cognitive&#xD;
      Behavioural Therapy (CBT). It is therefore hypothesised that much of current research for the&#xD;
      characterisation of ADHD is based on a cognitive behavioural paradigm that is deficit-focused&#xD;
      with primary treatment outcomes of symptom reduction and control of maladaptive behaviours.&#xD;
      Research in psychology suggests that a deficit-focus may not be the best approach to&#xD;
      improving mental health, and it may be necessary to develop positive psychological factors&#xD;
      and emotions that cultivate health and wellbeing. In ADHD, research suggests that this&#xD;
      includes cognitive dynamism, creativity, and resilience, among others. There is a paucity of&#xD;
      research in this area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project proposes an alternative approach to understanding and working with ADHD&#xD;
      behaviours, supported by Self Determination Theory (SDT). SDT is an empirical, organismic&#xD;
      dialectical approach to human motivation and personality, originating in Positive Psychology.&#xD;
      SDT guided research focuses on conditions that enhance intrinsic motivation, self-regulation,&#xD;
      and wellbeing. The positive approach to active energisation and intention of behaviour in SDT&#xD;
      is closely aligned to evidence of positive engagement in ADHD (e.g. via interest), therefore&#xD;
      viewing ADHD behaviours from an SDT perspective allows for a different understanding of the&#xD;
      action and intention of behaviour. An SDT based approach combined with psychotherapeutic&#xD;
      principles for integration of a positive concept of self provides tools which are potentially&#xD;
      effective for long term treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the challenges to designing effective treatment is the variability of impairment&#xD;
      experienced by individuals with ADHD. Impairments are viewed as &quot;clusters&quot; of chronic&#xD;
      difficulty for everyone with an ADHD diagnosis, however individual profiles can differ&#xD;
      significantly. This implies there are situations or contexts where individuals with ADHD can&#xD;
      function successfully. Two phases of this project have been developed to support this&#xD;
      hypothesis. The aim of Phase 2 is to generate a theory, grounded in data, that explains a)&#xD;
      why and how individuals with ADHD experience variable impairment; b) the impact of variable&#xD;
      impairment for those with ADHD; and c) processes and strategies used by those with ADHD to&#xD;
      resolve their main concerns regarding the impact and consequences of the variable impairment&#xD;
      of ADHD. The purpose is to identify universal selective strengths that support individuals&#xD;
      with ADHD to manage the variability of their impairment. In support of these alternative&#xD;
      theories and approaches, Phase 3 of this project aims to examine the participant&#xD;
      acceptability, feasibility, and efficacy of a novel strength - based programme of therapeutic&#xD;
      self-development, psychoeducation and skills training for adults with a diagnosis of ADHD.&#xD;
      This programme will use a multi-modal psychotherapeutic approach and educational methodology&#xD;
      to assist participants in understanding ADHD and develop self-management skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While ADHD is primarily viewed as a neurobiological disorder with no cure, the possibility&#xD;
      that ADHD may confer advantages to the individual is widely debated. Research on phenomena&#xD;
      concerning the experience of ADHD has theoretical implications, and grounded theory is&#xD;
      presented as a research methodology that is ideal for an area where not much research or&#xD;
      theorising has been done before. There are currently several methodological approaches to&#xD;
      grounded theory, and for this project it was deemed most appropriate to use a Constructivist&#xD;
      approach. This approach introduces a pragmatic epistemological perspective on the researcher&#xD;
      by recognising the subjectivity and researcher involvement in construction and interpretation&#xD;
      of data in theory construction. This was thought to be an important element to monitor during&#xD;
      the research process due to the researcher's own personal experience of ADHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In keeping with the focus on selecting cases which may provide new insights for developing&#xD;
      theory, this project will aim to approach three different groups for participation: NHS&#xD;
      patients from the Adult ADHD Clinic at the Southwest Yorkshire Partnership NHS Foundation&#xD;
      Trust; university students at the University of Huddersfield and the University of Cambridge;&#xD;
      and ADHD Support Groups for adults with ADHD. Analysis of individual case studies was&#xD;
      considered, however as current perspectives of positive psychological factors in ADHD are&#xD;
      identified as &quot;individual strengths&quot;, it was thought a case comparison on interviews might&#xD;
      identify the phenomenon in a more universal way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Phase 2 grounded theory research aims to reach saturation following analysis of 5-10&#xD;
      participant interviews. However, due to the nature of grounded theory, this can only be&#xD;
      finalised as part of the process. It is possible more participants will&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unlike other qualitative methods, grounded theory approaches recommend that the inquiry&#xD;
      shapes the data collection. This process of finding and generating data that is &quot;rich&quot;, or&#xD;
      detailed, focused, and full, provides solid material for substantive analysis. Therefore,&#xD;
      this project will identify some areas to begin initial data collection, while remaining open&#xD;
      to emerging potential data examples. These areas are intensive interviews, videos, and memos&#xD;
      or field notes by the researcher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design - Pilot Study This is a wait list control study design with pre-, within, and&#xD;
      post-treatment measures. A rolling entry of participants will be conducted, where once&#xD;
      individuals have been screened their entry into the study will begin. A maximum of 30 adults&#xD;
      aged 18+ with a confirmed diagnosis of ADHD will be allocated using block randomisation to&#xD;
      the SDT theory-based model or wait list over a 12-week period. Following the 12-week wait,&#xD;
      the wait list group will also be enrolled in the SDT theory-based model. This ensures all&#xD;
      participants receive the opportunity to experience the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited from NHS patients at the Adult ADHD Clinic at the Southwest&#xD;
      Yorkshire Partnership NHS Foundation Trust only.Phase 3 is a pilot feasibility study, and the&#xD;
      aim is to recruit 15 participants per arm for the two arm pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acceptability, feasibility, and efficacy of the intervention will be measured by attendance&#xD;
      and completion of evaluation forms at the end of each session. A follow up interview a week&#xD;
      post-treatment will provide an opportunity for feedback and evaluation by post-treatment&#xD;
      measures. Due to Covid-19 restrictions for research that requires in-person contact,&#xD;
      consideration for the safety of participants and institution and NHS staff was incorporated&#xD;
      into this study design. All interviews, screening, and treatment sessions will be conducted&#xD;
      online, on an NHS approved video platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test for treatment effects within the two groups, the psychometric data before and after&#xD;
      therapy will be analysed statistically using a paired samples t-test, or dependant t-test. To&#xD;
      test for treatment effects within the two groups, the psychometric data before and after&#xD;
      therapy will be analysed statistically using the non-parametric paired-Wilcoxon test. Cohen's&#xD;
      D will be calculated as a measure of effect size. To reduce bias, an intention to treat&#xD;
      analysis will be used but it is recognised that challenges may occur due to missing data;&#xD;
      based on withdrawal, loss to follow up, or non-response of assessment questionnaires and the&#xD;
      degree of this this will be considered at the time of analysis. Therefore, the study will be&#xD;
      reviewed using the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomised trials (RoB 2). All&#xD;
      analysis will be conducted with SPSS version 26.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ethical process for this project is being reviewed by the University of Huddersfield&#xD;
      School of Human and Health Sciences - School Research Ethics and Integrity Committee (SREIC)&#xD;
      and will be reviewed by a relevant NHS ethics committee. Governance approvals will be&#xD;
      obtained from university and NHS Trust sites. All sessions with Participants will be held in&#xD;
      adherence with the Ethical Framework for Good Practice set by the UK Council for&#xD;
      Psychotherapy (UKCP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP) accredited psychotherapy&#xD;
      supervisor will be engaged for two hours per month or one hour for every six patient sessions&#xD;
      for the duration of the project to measure progress and review case work with participants if&#xD;
      needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive an invitation to an initial interview to discuss participation in&#xD;
      the study. An information sheet detailing the purpose, activities, outcomes, and results of&#xD;
      Phase 2 will be provided, including the researcher contact details (name, phone number, email&#xD;
      address). Participants will be encouraged to read the information sheet again and ask&#xD;
      questions on the assessment day prior to signing the consent form. The voluntary nature of&#xD;
      participation and the ability to withdraw an individual's consent at any time will be&#xD;
      emphasised during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the Phase 2 intensive interviews, all participants will be entered into a draw for a £50&#xD;
      Amazon voucher. This was suggested by the lived experience group as contribution to research&#xD;
      for ADHD was not considered enough of a benefit alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For participants in the Phase 3 pilot study, they will receive 11 weekly sessions of&#xD;
      individually focused therapeutic coaching support which is not currently accessible within&#xD;
      the service. It is possible that a waitlist control design study might be an incentive for&#xD;
      participants to join, as all participants in the study will eventually receive the&#xD;
      intervention. However, we considered it unethical to offer a place in the study without the&#xD;
      option to receive the intervention. Participants will be given a minimum of 24 hours and up&#xD;
      to three days to consider participation in the study, and the researcher will be available to&#xD;
      answer any questions they have.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A critical element of this research project is the exploration and representation of the&#xD;
      lived experience of adults with ADHD, and the applicability, efficacy, and accessibility of&#xD;
      the results. Therefore, this project has involved a patient participation group in pre-study&#xD;
      preparation before recruitment. A small group of 5-6 adults with ADHD who expressed strong&#xD;
      interest in the research have reviewed and refined recruitment materials for Phase 2 and&#xD;
      Phase 3, including the recruitment flyers, patient information sheets, consent forms and&#xD;
      interview guide.&#xD;
