  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Single-center, randomized, parallel-group, controlled, open-label study. The aim of the study&#xD;
      was to evaluate the effects of an exercise training program intervention of different&#xD;
      intensities (high intensity versus low-moderate intensity) on blood pressure reduction as a&#xD;
      complementary strategy in hypertensive individuals being treated with at least one&#xD;
      antihypertensive drug.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All participants included in the study were referred by their primary care physicians, who&#xD;
      prescribed physical exercise as a healthy lifestyle intervention added to the&#xD;
      antihypertensive regimens in the framework of the &quot;ACTIVA-Murcia Program&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the HIT and LMIT groups followed the same physical training program, with the&#xD;
      only difference being the intensity of the training. The program included two phases of&#xD;
      physical exercise lasting 12 weeks and 16 weeks, respectively, separated by a 7-week rest&#xD;
      period, which coincided with a holiday period. The times of both phases were not equal in&#xD;
      terms of duration, since it is a community physical exercise program established by the&#xD;
      Region of Murcia, and does not depend on the researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The program was developed by graduates in Physical Activity and Sport Sciences, who were in&#xD;
      charge of teaching the exercises and supervised each training session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants assigned to the HIT and LMIT groups were given guidelines to continue physical&#xD;
      exercise during the 7-week rest period, while participants in the control group were offered&#xD;
      to participate in the program after the study.&#xD;
