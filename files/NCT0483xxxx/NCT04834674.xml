  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is a malignant tumor of biliary epithelial cells that&#xD;
      originates from the branches of the intrahepatic bile duct at the second level and above. Its&#xD;
      incidence accounts for about 15%-20% of primary liver malignancies, showing a gradually&#xD;
      increasing trend. Surgical resection is currently the main method for the treatment of ICC.&#xD;
      However, most (60% -70%) patients are diagnosed at the advanced stage. Gemcitabine plus&#xD;
      cisplatin is the standard first-line incurable resection recommended in international and&#xD;
      domestic guidelines. There is not a standard second-line treatment that has progressed after&#xD;
      standard first-line chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical benefits of immune therapies for HCC are emerging. Early clinical data already&#xD;
      show the safety of immune checkpoint inhibition. This study is to analyze the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of drug-eluting beads transarterial chemoembolization combined with apatinib and&#xD;
      carrelizumab injection in the treatment of ICC that has progressed after standard first-line&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who were aged 18 to 80 years with a histological or cytological diagnosis of&#xD;
      ICC，locally advanced or multiple liver metastases, including progression after gemcitabine&#xD;
      chemotherapy, will be enrolled in this trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a single arm, single center, open label study. It is estimated that 20 patients&#xD;
      with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma which progressed after treatment with standard&#xD;
      first-line chemotherapy in patients will be enrolled. The trial period of subjects includes&#xD;
      screening period, treatment period and follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drug treatment was 200 mg of PD-1 monoclonal antibody, intravenous infusion on the first&#xD;
      day, every 21 days as a treatment cycle; mesylate apatinib, 250 mg, oral once a day,&#xD;
      continuous oral; DEB-TACE, the CalliSpheres + gemcitabine (800mg) and oxaliplatin were&#xD;
      injected into the hepatic artery by routine procedure, repeated every 4-6 weeks, and&#xD;
      administered for according to the physician in charge, DEB-TACE treatment cycles. Treatment&#xD;
      continues until the disease progresses, intolerable toxicity occurs, new anti-tumor treatment&#xD;
      is started, informed consent is withdrawn, follow-up is lost, death occurs or treatment&#xD;
      termination is required。 Screening will be performed between days - 21 and - 4. Informed&#xD;
      consent was signed up to 4 weeks prior to the first day of cycle 1 before any screening&#xD;
      procedure or evaluation was performed and the trial was fully explained to each subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline evaluation results must be collected prior to the first trial drug administration&#xD;
      (day 1 of cycle 1). Baseline assessments may be performed between days - 3 and - 1 or on day&#xD;
      1 of cycle 1. If performed within 3 days before the first day of cycle 1, the screening&#xD;
      results can be used as baseline results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tumor imaging was evaluated every 4-6 weeks since the first administration, and every 12&#xD;
      weeks (± 7 days) after 24 weeks. If there are clinical indications for disease progression,&#xD;
      tumor evaluation is more frequent. In the event of disease progression, unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity, the subject's request to discontinue the trial or the subject's withdrawal of&#xD;
      consent, the subject will discontinue the trial treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the trial treatment is stopped, the treatment visit shall be stopped within 7 days after&#xD;
      the treatment is stopped in order to stop the treatment examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the end of the treatment period (up to 2 years), subjects who can benefit from the&#xD;
      study drug will continue to study the treatment of the drug until disease progression,&#xD;
      intolerable adverse reactions, withdrawal of intensive care facility (ICF), other anti-tumor&#xD;
      treatment, loss of follow-up, death or termination of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the occurrence of a clinical event, if it is judged by the investigators that it should&#xD;
      be attributed to the progress of the disease and it is unlikely to recover even if the&#xD;
      patient continues to receive treatment, it can be evaluated as clinical deterioration. It is&#xD;
      up to the investigator to discuss and decide whether to continue or stop the treatment for&#xD;
      the subject and record in the study file.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the study, subjects who are still under study treatment can continue to receive&#xD;
      treatment through another extended study or other forms at the discretion of the investigator&#xD;
      if they are stable or relieved in the efficacy evaluation and can tolerate the adverse&#xD;
      reactions.&#xD;
