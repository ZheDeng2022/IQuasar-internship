      This study is designed to evaluate the comparability of TG103 injection subject to changes in&#xD;
      the manufacturing process in Chinese healthy male subjects.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label, parallel-group, comparative study to evaluate the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) profiles, safety, and immunogenicity of TG103&#xD;
      injection produced by two different manufacturing processes in Chinese healthy male subjects.&#xD;
      Approximately 24 eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive a single dose&#xD;
      of TG103 produced by the modified manufacturing process or TG103 produced by the original&#xD;
      manufacturing process via subcutaneous (SC) injection.&#xD;
