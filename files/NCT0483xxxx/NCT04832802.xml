  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The reason for conducting this study is to learn about the best ways to help Veterans with&#xD;
      spinal cord injury (SCI) gain meaningful employment. Spinal cord injury is a medically&#xD;
      complex disability that poses unique barriers to employment for Veterans. Returning to work&#xD;
      after SCI improves health and quality of life, which in turn can lower risk for suicide in&#xD;
      this high-risk population. Hence, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) supports&#xD;
      interventions that help Veterans with SCI return to work and may prevent suicide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Customized employment (CE) is an innovative strategy for tailoring vocational services to&#xD;
      meet the needs of people with complex disabilities. To address barriers to employment faced&#xD;
      by Veterans with SCI, this study will evaluate whether a customized employment intervention&#xD;
      used in non-VA settings can be adapted for use by the VA as a part of SCI medical&#xD;
      rehabilitation. The research goal is to evaluate how a CE intervention for Veterans with SCI&#xD;
      (ACCESS-Vets) can help them discover their strengths to find and maintain competitive&#xD;
      integrated employment in their communities. This study will compare ACCESS-Vets with the&#xD;
      usual evidence-based supported employment program, known as Individual Placement and Support&#xD;
      (IPS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Veterans with SCI who chose to participate in this study will be randomly selected (i.e. by&#xD;
      chance) to work with a vocational rehabilitation specialist as part of the ACCESS-Vets&#xD;
      intervention or the usual IPS employment program for about 8 months. Study participants will&#xD;
      complete study questionnaires before, during, and after their participation in the employment&#xD;
      interventions. Some Veterans and their medical rehabilitation providers will be interviewed&#xD;
      about their experiences with the employment interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study expects to find that Veterans who participate in ACCESS-Vets will have better&#xD;
      employment and quality of life outcomes then those who participate in IPS. The study will&#xD;
      provide information about the strategies used in the ACCESS-Vets and IPS interventions for&#xD;
      addressing barriers to employment. Ultimately, this study may provide a model for making VA&#xD;
      vocational services for Veterans with SCI more effective and sustainable.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial (RCT) will test the effectiveness of a customized employment&#xD;
      (CE) intervention, Achieving Competitive Customized Employment through Specialized Services&#xD;
      (ACCESS-Vets), to complement clinical services for Veterans with spinal cord injury (SCI) and&#xD;
      improve their employment outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Restoring employment is an important rehabilitation goal for Veterans with SCI&#xD;
      because employment impacts both quality of life (QOL) and longevity. Due to the medical&#xD;
      complexity of SCI, however, these Veterans face unique employment barriers that are not&#xD;
      adequately addressed by current Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) vocational services.&#xD;
      Vocational services for Veterans with SCI need to address these employment barriers, which&#xD;
      relate to physical health, finances, time for job search, and caregiver issues. Customized&#xD;
      employment, an innovative strategy for tailoring vocational services to meet individual needs&#xD;
      of people with complex disabilities, could be adapted for use in SCI rehabilitation. This&#xD;
      research will evaluate a CE intervention to help Veterans with SCI discover their strengths,&#xD;
      customize employment plans, and find competitive integrated employment in their communities.&#xD;
      The proposed intervention, ACCESS, is a user-driven, standardized CE program delivered by a&#xD;
      trained employment specialist and is effective for a non-clinical, community-based population&#xD;
      of adults with disabilities. This research is needed to test ACCESS as a complement to&#xD;
      clinical services for a clinically defined population and to assess the potential of CE for&#xD;
      subsequent implementation in the VA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Plan: The effectiveness of ACCESS-Vets will be tested with an RCT of 100 Veterans&#xD;
      with SCI. The study will have a rolling enrollment period with an intervention period of 26&#xD;
      months. ACCESS-Vets is typically completed in 8 months and includes the following elements:&#xD;
      discovery, CE planning, job development, CE negotiation, and accommodations and job retention&#xD;
      supports. Individual Placement and Support (IPS), otherwise known as evidence-based supported&#xD;
      employment, will serve as an active control group consistent with treatment as usual.&#xD;
      ACCESS-Vets and IPS will be compared on changes in employment attainment. The investigators&#xD;
      predict Veterans who participate in ACCESS-Vets will have a higher employment rate than&#xD;
      Veterans who receiving IPS. Among Veterans who attain employment, the investigators predict&#xD;
      those who received ACCESS-Vets will report higher job satisfaction, wages, and retention. The&#xD;
      investigators predict, Veterans who attain employment will demonstrate statistically&#xD;
      significant improvements in self-sufficiency, QOL, and participation in life roles compared&#xD;
      with those who do not attain employment. Finally, qualitative interviews with Veterans and&#xD;
      their providers will identify strategies used in IPS and ACCESS-Vets for addressing barriers&#xD;
      to employment and how practitioners adapt the ACCESS-Vets intervention for use in a VA&#xD;
      clinical setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: This study is responsive to Veterans' reported desire for individualized&#xD;
      vocational rehabilitation services and to the Modernization Plan and the MISSION Act, which&#xD;
      emphasize Veteran-centered, community-based approaches to care. The proposal goals align with&#xD;
      the Transformation Plan of the Office of Mental Health and Suicide Prevention, which&#xD;
      prioritizes evidence-informed, community-based employment services. Recognizing the rapid&#xD;
      adoption of CE in state and federal agencies, VA is partnering with the Office of Disability&#xD;
      and Employment Policy (U.S. Department of Labor) to introduce and train VA vocational staff&#xD;
      on CE as a promising practice; however, integration of CE into standard VA clinical services&#xD;
      has not yet been implemented. In support of VA efforts to assist Veterans to achieve&#xD;
      competitive employment and reintegration into civilian life, this proposal will evaluate CE&#xD;
      within the context of existing VA vocational services.&#xD;
