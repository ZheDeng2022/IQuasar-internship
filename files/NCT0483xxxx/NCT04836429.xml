  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial evaluates the side effects of intraoperative photodynamic therapy with&#xD;
      porfimer sodium in enhancing the response to immunotherapy with an immune checkpoint&#xD;
      inhibitor drug in patients with non-small cell lung cancer with pleural disease. Photodynamic&#xD;
      therapy is a technique that that works by combining a photosensitizing agent (porfimer sodium&#xD;
      in this trial) and an intense light source to kill tumor cells. Photodynamic therapy may&#xD;
      decrease the patients' symptoms and improve their quality of life.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically confirmed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with pleural disease and&#xD;
             PDL1 expression &lt; 50%&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient should be considered a candidate for chemoimmunotherapy by the treating&#xD;
             medical oncologist&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt;= 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score of 0 - 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraceptive methods&#xD;
             (e.g., hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry&#xD;
             and for 6 months after surgery. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is&#xD;
             pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform&#xD;
             her treating physician immediately&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject must understand the investigational nature of this study and sign an&#xD;
             Independent Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board approved written informed&#xD;
             consent prior to receiving any study related procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Platelet count &lt; 100,000&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for&#xD;
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not&#xD;
             recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with untreated or symptomatically unstable treated brain metastases should be&#xD;
             excluded from this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they&#xD;
             often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of&#xD;
             neurologic and other adverse events. Patients with treated and stable brain metastases&#xD;
             (at least 28 days from last radiotherapy treatment) are eligible as long as steroids&#xD;
             are not required for symptom management&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with porphyria, or with known hypersensitivity to porphyrins or&#xD;
             porphyrin-like compounds&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt; lower level of normal (LLN)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total bilirubin &gt; 2 mg/dL&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  NOTE: Roswell Park clinical lab blood chemistry is performed on plasma unless&#xD;
                  otherwise indicated&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or nursing female subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unwilling or unable to follow protocol requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any condition which in the Investigator's opinion deems the subject an unsuitable&#xD;
             candidate to receive porfimer sodium&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Received an investigational agent within 30 days prior to enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of, or active autoimmune disorder, requiring systemic steroids or&#xD;
             immunosuppressive agents. Exceptions allowed: patients with autoimmune dermatologic&#xD;
             conditions not requiring systemic steroids or immunosuppressive agents (e.g. vitiligo,&#xD;
             eczema, etc.), endocrine-related autoimmune conditions receiving appropriate hormonal&#xD;
             supplementation. Use of immunosuppressant drugs such as steroids, azathioprine,&#xD;
             tacrolimus, cyclosporine, etc. is not permitted within 4 weeks before recruitment&#xD;
             (exception allowed is use of steroids as hormone replacement therapy or as supportive&#xD;
             medication e.g. anti-emesis, contrast allergy, pre-medication, etc. or other&#xD;
             short-course therapy less than 2 weeks continuously within 4 weeks of study treatment)&#xD;
