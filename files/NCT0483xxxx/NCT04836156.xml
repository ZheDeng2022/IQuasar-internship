  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neoadjuvant treatment is an important treatment for early breast cancer patients. Patients&#xD;
      with triple negative subtype who achieved pCR after neoadjuvant treatment would have longer&#xD;
      survival. The neoadjuvant treatment for her2 negative patient was chemotherapy with combined&#xD;
      drugs. However, not all patients benefit from chemotherapy but suffer from&#xD;
      chemotherapy-related side effects. It was unknown for a patient who could benefit from which&#xD;
      drug before chemotherapy. Drug sensitivity screening in vitro was a promising method for&#xD;
      choosing chemotherapy. But there was no method could select effective drugs accurately for&#xD;
      breast cancer patients until now.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previously, investigators developed a patient-derived tumor-like cell clusters in vitro&#xD;
      culture technology. Feasibility for guiding clinical treatment by drug sensitivity screening&#xD;
      based on this technology have been explored by preliminary exploration with a well&#xD;
      corresponding. And the results have been published. This study will explore whether drug&#xD;
      screening in vitro patient-derived tumor-like cell clusters from breast cancer tissue could&#xD;
      be a method for selection of chemotherapy for her2 negative participants.&#xD;

      Neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer could make unresectable breast cancer be&#xD;
      resectable and improve breast conservation rate. Patients with triple negative subtype who&#xD;
      achieved pCR after neoadjuvant treatment would have longer survival. The neoadjuvant&#xD;
      treatment for her2 negative patient was chemotherapy with combined drugs. However, not all&#xD;
      patients benefit from chemotherapy but suffer from chemotherapy-related side effects. It was&#xD;
      unknown for a patient who could benefit from which drug before chemotherapy. Drug sensitivity&#xD;
      screening in vitro was a promising method for choosing chemotherapy. But there was no method&#xD;
      could select effective drugs accurately for breast cancer participants until now.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previously, investigators developed a patient-derived tumor-like cell clusters (PTC) in vitro&#xD;
      culture technology. It is a cell cluster including tumor cells, mesenchymal cells and&#xD;
      lymphocytes, which simulates the tumor microenvironment in vitro. In the preliminary&#xD;
      exploration, investigators included 35 early breast cancer participants, the corresponding&#xD;
      between in vitro drug sensitivity screening based on this technology and clinical treatment&#xD;
      results was well. The results have been published.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will focus on her2 negative early breast cancer participants. 46 participants will&#xD;
      be included. All of them will received in vitro drug sensitivity screening upon PTC before&#xD;
      neoadjuvant therapy. The choice of chemotherapy drugs is determined based on the PTC drug&#xD;
      sensitivity results. If single-agent chemotherapy is effective in vitro, this drug will be&#xD;
      the chemotherapy regimen for the corresponding participants.&#xD;
