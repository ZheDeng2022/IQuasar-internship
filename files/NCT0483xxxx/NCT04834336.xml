  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hospitalized patients with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) present a high prevalence&#xD;
      of inspiratory muscle weakness on admission and discharge. Inspiratory muscle training has&#xD;
      been reported as a beneficial approach in chronic heart failure. However, the effects of&#xD;
      inspiratory muscle training in hospitalized patients with ADHF have been not known. The aim&#xD;
      of this study is to investigate the safety, feasibility, and effects of inspiratory muscle&#xD;
      training in hospitalized patients with ADHF.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The participants will randomly be allocated into two groups: (1) Physical training plus&#xD;
      inspiratory muscle training, (2) Physical training&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the physical training plus inspiratory muscle training group will perform&#xD;
      inspiratory muscle training and physical training. Inspiratory muscle training will be&#xD;
      applied with an electronic device. Physical training will be implemented as balance,&#xD;
      mobility, functional strength, endurance exercises. During the hospitalization, the&#xD;
      inspiratory muscle training will be carried out twice a day with mild to moderate whereas&#xD;
      physical training will be carried out once a day. The physical training group will perform&#xD;
      only physical training. Physical training will be implemented as balance, mobility,&#xD;
      functional strength, endurance exercises. During the hospitalization, physical training will&#xD;
      be carried out once a day. For the safety and feasibility of inspiratory muscle training,&#xD;
      data will be collected daily during the hospitalization. For effects of inspiratory muscle&#xD;
      training, data will be collected at baseline and hospital discharge.&#xD;

    <description>Inspiratory Muscle Training (IMT) will be implemented by using the Power Breathe® device. IMT training will begin with mild to moderate intensity of maximal inspiratory pressure. It will be performed 6 to 10 breaths, 4 sets, and twice daily during the hospitalization when as soon as hemodynamic stability is provided.&#xD;
Physical Training will consist of each functional domain (balance, mobility, strength, and endurance) according to patients' functional levels. These will include static and dynamic balance training, mobility training, functional strength training focused on lower extremities, and endurance training as sustained walking. A daily 30 min session during the hospitalization will be performed with one-on-one supervision when as soon as hemodynamic stability is provided.</description>
