      The intervention of this study is the addition of patient-selected music during IUD insertion&#xD;
      procedure. Subjects randomized to the music group will choose 10 songs, which will be played&#xD;
      during the procedure, from the time of positioning through completion of IUD insertion and&#xD;
      speculum removal. Music may be played through a portable speaker in close proximity to the&#xD;
      patient or through the patient's own headphones, if preferred. Music will be played at a low&#xD;
      enough volume for subjects to hear standard anticipatory guidance during the procedure. Both&#xD;
      control and music groups will otherwise undergo the same standard protocol for IUD insertion&#xD;
      in an outpatient clinic setting. Total participation is predicted to last approximately 30&#xD;
      minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in both control and intervention groups will undergo the same assessment of pain&#xD;
      during IUD insertion using the 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS). This will be administered at&#xD;
      8 points during the procedure. All subjects will also answer the same 5-question satisfaction&#xD;
      survey following IUD insertion. Pain scores will be measured and compared between music and&#xD;
      control groups to assess the primary and secondary outcomes of this study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, two-center, randomized controlled trial evaluating whether music&#xD;
      reduces pain and improves satisfaction during IUD insertion. Computer-generated randomization&#xD;
      assignments will allocate subjects to either music or standard protocol groups. 40 music and&#xD;
      40 control designations will be allocated to both sites, and all designations will be&#xD;
      block-stratified into 10 blocks, each containing 4 controls and 4 intervention (music)&#xD;
      subjects. This will ensure there are close to equal numbers of subjects in both groups if&#xD;
      recruitment is halted before the minimum of 80 patients are enrolled. Assignments are&#xD;
      available in a read-only document accessible by all co-investigators at the time of&#xD;
      enrollment and randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects randomized to the music group will choose 10 songs, which will be played during the&#xD;
      procedure, from the time of positioning through completion of IUD insertion and speculum&#xD;
      removal. Music may be played through a portable speaker in close proximity to the patient or&#xD;
      through the patient's own headphones, if preferred. Both control and music groups will&#xD;
      otherwise undergo the same standard anticipatory guidance and protocol for IUD insertion in&#xD;
      an outpatient clinic setting. Total participation is predicted to last approximately 30&#xD;
      minutes, as is standard for an appointment for IUD insertion. Study subjects will not&#xD;
      interact with other participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in both control and intervention groups will undergo intrauterine device (IUD)&#xD;
      insertion. Pain will be assessed using a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS) at 8 points during&#xD;
      the procedure, including: (1) anticipated pain, (2) baseline pain prior to IUD insertion, (3)&#xD;
      after speculum placement, (4) on tenaculum application, (5) on uterine sounding, (6) at IUD&#xD;
      insertion, (7) after speculum removal, and (8) 5 minutes following the procedure. Patients&#xD;
      will also answer a brief 5-question satisfaction survey following IUD insertion. Pain scores&#xD;
      will be measured and compared between music and control groups to assess the primary and&#xD;
      secondary outcomes of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VAS scores will be recorded by the attending physician or co-investigator, as they will&#xD;
      reliably note when each step of the procedure occurs and pain should be assessed. They will&#xD;
      present the 100mm visual analog scale (VAS) to the patient at each of the 8 points of the&#xD;
      procedure, and the patient will mark their pain score. Scores will be measured and documented&#xD;
      by a single co-investigator to eliminate bias or differences in measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VAS scores will be analyzed separately for each of the 8 distinct points described during the&#xD;
      IUD insertion procedure. Differences between the intervention (music) and control groups will&#xD;
      be assessed using a 0.05 level Wilcoxon ranksum test. A significant difference in pain will&#xD;
      be noted if at least a 20 mm difference in VAS pain score exists between the two groups at&#xD;
      any point of the procedure when VAS score is collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to determine if music, chosen by the patient and played during IUD&#xD;
      insertion, leads to lower pain scores and improved patient satisfaction with the procedure.&#xD;
