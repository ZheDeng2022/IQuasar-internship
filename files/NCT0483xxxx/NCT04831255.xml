  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adhesive capsulitis is a fairly common orthopedic condition that causes pain and loss of&#xD;
      range of motion. There are a variety of ways to treat adhesive capsulitis, one of them being&#xD;
      an intra-articular steroid injection. This is done to help decrease the inflammatory response&#xD;
      caused by adhesive capsulitis. In this study, all participants will receive an&#xD;
      intra-articular glenohumeral injection of ZILRETTA and will be followed up with at four time&#xD;
      points over 1 year to observe pain, function and range of motion following the injection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adhesive capsulitis is a painful shoulder condition characterized by a gradual loss of both&#xD;
      passive and active range of motion due to inflammatory changes and eventual fibrosis and&#xD;
      contracture of the shoulder joint capsule. It occurs in about 2% to 5% of the population, and&#xD;
      a majority of patients are female. The true cause of the condition remains unclear, however,&#xD;
      it has been proposed that the initial synovitis stimulates the development of a fibrotic&#xD;
      cascade. The development of adhesive capsulitis has been associated with diabetes mellitus,&#xD;
      thyroid dysfunction, Dupuytrens contractures, autoimmune diseases and treatments for certain&#xD;
      cancers. Adhesive capsulitis progresses through four predictable phases, defined by symptoms,&#xD;
      physical examination, arthroscopic appearance and biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regardless of stage, the mainstay of treatment for adhesive capsulitis of the shoulder is&#xD;
      conservative, focused mainly on physical therapy combined with a home exercise program,&#xD;
      regardless of stage. Pharmacologic agents are often used as adjuncts to physical therapy, and&#xD;
      include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs), oral corticosteroids and&#xD;
      intra-articular injections of corticosteroids. Although a large percentage of patients in the&#xD;
      early stages of disease respond well to conservative treatments, those who fail therapy and&#xD;
      injections may require surgical intervention, including arthroscopy with lysis of adhesions&#xD;
      and/or manipulation under anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numerous studies have investigated the effect and success of injections combined with&#xD;
      standard physical therapy for adhesive capsulitis of the shoulder. In general,&#xD;
      intra-articular injection of corticosteroids has been found to be superior to administration&#xD;
      of oral cortisone and at least equivalent to manipulation under anesthesia alone. Injections&#xD;
      have been shown to reduce pain quicker and result in earlier return of range of motion. Low&#xD;
      doses of steroid appear equally as effective as higher doses. Image-guided injections,&#xD;
      whether ultrasound or fluoroscopic guided injections, have also been shown to be more&#xD;
      effective than blinded injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Failure of an injection and therapy to provide relief either results in a repeat image-guided&#xD;
      injection or surgical intervention, both of which have significant associated cost and&#xD;
      potential morbidity. Thus, there would be significant potential value to a long-acting,&#xD;
      sustained release intra-articular steroid injection for the treatment of adhesive capsulitis&#xD;
      of the shoulder. Zilretta®, triamcinolone acetonide extended release suspension 32 mg, is a&#xD;
      microsphere formulation of injectable steroid which is FDA-approved for and has shown&#xD;
      significant promise for the treatment of knee osteoarthritis. This long-acting steroid could&#xD;
      have several important advantages in the treatment of shoulder adhesive capsulitis. It may&#xD;
      potentiate and prolong the anti-inflammatory effect of the steroid, and potentially avoid the&#xD;
      need for costly additional image-guided injections or expensive and potentially morbid&#xD;
      surgery. An additional potential benefit is less elevation of peripheral blood glucose in&#xD;
      diabetics, a known complication of traditional steroid injections that has been demonstrated&#xD;
      to be mitigated using a sustained release formulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Out primary aim in this study is to assess patient reported pain and outcomes in patients&#xD;
      with idiopathic adhesive capsulitis of the shoulder at 3, 6 and 12 months following single,&#xD;
      image guided ZILRETTA injection.&#xD;
