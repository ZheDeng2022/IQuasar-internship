      The purpose of this study is to retrospectively analyze electroanatomical data collected&#xD;
      during persistent atrial fibrillation ablation procedures, combined with pre-ablation cardiac&#xD;
      CT data, in order to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  define a new method for quantifying left atrial voltage in atrial fibrillation via a&#xD;
           total energy map instead of a peak-to-peak amplitude map&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  confirm the association between epicardial fat localization and atrial conduction&#xD;
           slowing&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia, with an estimated prevalence in 2010&#xD;
      of 33.5 million people (3% of the world population). It is now estimated that 1 in 4&#xD;
      middle-aged adults in Europe and the United States will develop AF in their lifetime. Of&#xD;
      course, the aging of the population is considered one of the major explanations for this&#xD;
      pandemic phenomenon, as well as the ever-increasing prevalence of overweight and obesity.&#xD;
      Complications related to this arrhythmia are numerous and frequent, with thromboembolic&#xD;
      events having a major impact on morbidity. Thus, it is estimated that AF is responsible for a&#xD;
      quarter of ischemic strokes and increases the risk of stroke fivefold. At the same time,&#xD;
      there is an increased risk of long-term heart failure, which is responsible for excess&#xD;
      mortality. Finally, patients with AF frequently have an impaired quality of life and a higher&#xD;
      rate of hospitalization than patients in sinus rhythm (10 to 40% of patients with AF are&#xD;
      hospitalized at least once a year). An association between AF and cognitive decline and risk&#xD;
      of vascular dementia (even in patients treated with anticoagulants) has also been described.&#xD;
      Depending on the temporality of AF, it is referred to as paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent&#xD;
      AF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endocavitary ablation for the treatment of atrial fibrillation was first described by the&#xD;
      Bordeaux team of Prof. Michel Ha√Øssaguerre in the early 1990s, who demonstrated the role of&#xD;
      electrical discharges from the pulmonary veins in the initiation of (paroxysmal) AF. The&#xD;
      following years therefore saw the development of tools to electrically isolate the pulmonary&#xD;
      veins from the left atrium, and then to try to identify and treat additional pathological&#xD;
      areas in the atria for more advanced (persistent) forms of AF. The advent of&#xD;
      three-dimensional modeling technologies has made it possible to develop intracardiac&#xD;
      navigation systems to guide AF ablation in 3D, while limiting fluoroscopy time for the&#xD;
      patient and staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In persistent AF, unlike paroxysmal AF, the technique used and the ablation targets are less&#xD;
      codified, with success rates lower than those obtained in paroxysmal AF. Indeed, unlike&#xD;
      paroxysmal AF, the pathophysiology of which is well understood, there is no unicist consensus&#xD;
      theory for persistent AF. Based on the hypothesis of the predominance of the substrate over&#xD;
      the pulmonary venous trigger in the self-maintenance of persistent AF, teams have highlighted&#xD;
      the major role of left atrial fibrosis in this pathology, which is the cause of conduction&#xD;
      heterogeneity in the left atrium. Work to elucidate the triggers of this fibrotic disease&#xD;
      emphasizes the key role of periatrial epicardial fat, which secretes pro-fibrotic mediators&#xD;
      and deregulates the atrial ganglionic plexi. An association has also been made between&#xD;
      epicardial fat volume and the incidence and maintenance of atrial fibrillation. In addition,&#xD;
      recent work demonstrates that the peri-atrial adipocyte environment modulates not only&#xD;
      fibrosis but also the conductive properties of atrial cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During endocavitary ablation of atrial fibrillation, multi-electrode diagnostic catheters&#xD;
      allow precise electroanatomical reconstruction of the left atrium, quantifying its geometry&#xD;
      but also the local electrical signals (electrograms), in terms of amplitude (voltage map) and&#xD;
      temporality relative to a reference (activation map). It is therefore theoretically possible&#xD;
      to build a map of conduction velocities in sinus rhythm or electroentrainment in the atrium,&#xD;
      by calculating the velocity and vector of electrical depolarization between each electrogram.&#xD;
      In parallel, before any AF ablation, an injected cardiac CT scan is performed for&#xD;
      three-dimensional atrial reconstruction. This scan also allows the quantification of the&#xD;
      atrial epicardial fat in terms of volume and density. We therefore want to develop an&#xD;
      algorithm allowing the construction of a map of velocities in sinus rhythm, fused to the&#xD;
      three-dimensional reconstruction of the location of the atrial epicardial fat.&#xD;
