    <textblock>
      The study involves MS patients with and without neuropsychological disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will benefit from:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A routine neuropsychological assessment, including a cognitive and emotional assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A clinical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A three-dimensional analysis of movement&#xD;

    <time_frame>60 days</time_frame>
    <description>The kinematics of the initiation of walking and walking will be appreciated thanks to the variables calculated at the level of the joints of the lower limbs as well as the spatio-temporal parameters without and with management of obstacles (taking a step, balloon)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Ocular fixation time (measured in ms)</measure>
    <time_frame>60 days</time_frame>
    <description>Visual exploration will be appreciated by the Ocular fixation time (measured in ms), when initiating walking, walking at spontaneous speed and when passing obstacles with or without a cognitive task. Visual exploration will also be measured after emotional priming when initiating walking and walking. This emotional priming will consist of the transfer of images from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS). This measurement will be carried out using eyetracking glasses worn by patients.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Muscle contractions determined by the electromyogram (EMG) (mV)</measure>
    <time_frame>60 days</time_frame>
    <description>The motor patterns (organizations of muscle contractions determined by measuring the EMG of muscles representative of walking) (mV) of the femoral, semi-tendinous, anterior tibial and soleus rectus muscles will be measured using surface EMG , for the two locomotor tasks (walking and initiation to walking), during walking at spontaneous speed (without double task, without crossing an obstacle).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Displacements (in mm) during walking</measure>
    <time_frame>60 days</time_frame>
    <description>The displacements (in mm) of the center of the body mass and of the center of pressure on the anteroposterior and mediolateral axes will be derived from the force platforms during the initiation of walking in different conditions (without and with emotional priming).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Acceleration (in mm.s-2) during walking</measure>
    <time_frame>60 days</time_frame>
    <description>The acceleration (in mm.s-2) of the center of the body mass and of the center of pressure on the anteroposterior and mediolateral axes will be derived from the force platforms during the initiation of walking in different conditions (without and with emotional priming).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Joint angles</measure>
    <time_frame>60 days</time_frame>
    <description>The articular moments and torques (Nm) at the joints of the lower limbs during the initiation to walking will be calculated from kinematic data from the motion analysis laboratory and dynamics of force platforms (without and with priming emotional).</description>

    <description>An emotional impregnation and eye pursuit assessment are specific to the study. Emotional impregnation involves making the patient look at images from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) on a screen before initiating walking. The equipment will be identical to that of the patient during walking tasks. Eye movement analysis is performed using a pair of eyetracking glasses.</description>
