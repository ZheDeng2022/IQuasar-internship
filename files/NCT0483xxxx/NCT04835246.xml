  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the diagnostic performance of a Raman spectroscopy&#xD;
      analysis device - Spectra IMDx for the detection of gastric cancer and precancerous lesions&#xD;
      in vivo.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single centre study to assess the diagnostic performance of Spectra&#xD;
      IMDx system in detection of gastric cancer and precancerous lesions in subjects with&#xD;
      suspected gastric intraepithelial neoplasia who are undergoing upper gastrointestinal&#xD;
      endoscopic procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Spectra IMDx system comprises a laser system, a spectrometer, a computer with an analysis&#xD;
      algorithm installed, and other ancillary parts. The Spectra IMDx system also comprises a&#xD;
      Raman probe that can be connected with the main system. The Raman probe is an assembly of&#xD;
      optical fibres and optical components arranged for maximal transmission of light energy. When&#xD;
      in use, the laser system will emit a 785nm near infra-red laser that will be transmitted&#xD;
      through the Raman probe to the distal end. When the laser is interrogated upon a tissue&#xD;
      surface, the light energy is absorbed and reflected. The reflected energy is then collected&#xD;
      from the distal end of the Raman probe, transmitted back to the main system, and passed&#xD;
      through the spectrometer. The collected signal is then processed to obtain the clean Raman&#xD;
      signal, which is then parsed through the analysis algorithm to evaluate its risk for cancer&#xD;
      (high/low). Feedback will then be generated on the GUI in real time.&#xD;

    <description>The physician will be asked to give a diagnosis of the lesion under White light endoscopy (WLE) firstly and the endoscopic diagnosis result will be recorded on case report form. Then the physician will introduce the probe of Spectra IMDx system to contact and assess the lesion. The Spectra IMDx system will detect the scattering light signal from the lesion and assess the risk of the lesion being high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia or gastric cancer, and display the result on the Spectra IMDx screen. The Spectra IMDx assessment will be recorded on case report form. Both the patient and doctor will be blinded from the results from Spectra IMDx system.&#xD;
After Spectra IMDx system examination, the physician takes biopsy sample(s) in suspected lesion for further histopathological diagnosis.</description>
