  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a open-label, nonramdominzed, single-arm, Phase I/II Study to evaluate safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of functionally enhanced CD33 CAR-T cells in subjects with relapsed or&#xD;
      refractory acute myeloid leukemia. 25 subjects will be enrolled. Subjects will be pretreated&#xD;
      with chemotherapy prior to infusion of CAR T cells: about 5 days before cells transfusion,&#xD;
      the patients who planned to reinfuse CAR T cells were treated with fluorodarabine 30 mg/m^2(&#xD;
      body surface area) and cyclophosphamide 250 mg/m^2( body surface area) for 3 days. Then the&#xD;
      Bayesian optimal interval phase I/II (Boin12) trial design will be used in this study: The&#xD;
      protocol preset 2 dose levels: Dose 1 (DL-1) was 5×10^5 (±20%) CAR T cells/kg, and dose 2&#xD;
      (DL-2) was 1×10^6 (±20%) CAR T cells/kg. Phase I was the dose exploration phase. After&#xD;
      determining the optimal biological dose (OBD), phase II will be expanded at the OBD dose by&#xD;
      10 cases, enrollment will reach 25 cases, and the trial will be discontinued. Moreover, the&#xD;
      first 3 enrolled subjects per dose group will be on one by one dosing regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected initial dose of 5×10^5 (±20%) CAR T cells/kg could not be achieved due to&#xD;
      preparation problems and should be placed in the reduced dose group. The number of cells will&#xD;
      be collected by the above regimen as far as possible. If this is not possible, subjects can&#xD;
      still enter the study upon investigator consideration but require documentation of dosing.&#xD;
      The lowest dose is 1×10^5 CAR T cells/kg (±20%), and the highest dose is 1×10^6 CAR T&#xD;
      cells/kg (±20%). If the dose is out of the range mentioned above, entry into the trial will&#xD;
      not be considered.&#xD;
