  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to assess the role of sociocognitive and interpersonal factors in&#xD;
      the therapeutic adherence of multiple sclerosis patients. This study will provide a better&#xD;
      understanding of the socio-psychological issues associated with different types of&#xD;
      non-adherence to treatment, and identify the risk factors and vulnerability of each patient.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis is a chronic and progressive disease that affects young adults (between 20&#xD;
      and 40 years old), impacting significantly the patients quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The adherence to therapy affects the long-term functional clinical course (lower risk of&#xD;
      relapses, reduction in disability progression and quality of life). The non-adherence rate to&#xD;
      therapy in multiple sclerosis is estimated at 40%. The main identified causes of&#xD;
      non-adherence are: forgetting to take treatment and adverse effects of drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sociocognitive models as the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) have been developed to help to&#xD;
      understand and predict health-related behaviours. This model postulates that the intention to&#xD;
      adopt a behaviour is one of the major determinants in the context of health. This intention&#xD;
      comes from three independent elements :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Personal positive or negative attitudes towards the behaviour,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Social expectations or entourage perception (subjective norms),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Difficulty in accomplishing this behaviour (perceived control)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple sclerosis adherence to therapy studies have mainly focused on somatic variables&#xD;
      (physical disability, illness duration, type of treatment) and some clinical variables&#xD;
      (cognitive impairment, fatigue, depression). The few studies that have examined the multiple&#xD;
      sclerosis therapeutic adherence determinants have mainly taken a one-dimensional perspective,&#xD;
      such as perceived control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the FELSA-SEP study, the role of sociocognitive factors (norms and beliefs, perceived&#xD;
      threat to disease and health behaviours) and interpersonal factors (social support,&#xD;
      patient-doctor relationship) will be explored.&#xD;

    <description>The perceived threat will be measured with a self-assessment form using a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). This 11-item self-questionnaire provides 2 sub-scores and an overall score (sum of the 2 sub-scores).</description>

    <description>The QSSP is a 6 items questionnaire which assess availability and satisfaction with respect to perceived social support.&#xD;
4-Point ordinal Alliance Scale (11-items 4-PAS). This self-questionnaire concerns the patient's perception about the therapeutic alliance.</description>

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The 4-Point ordinal Alliance Scale (11-items 4-PAS). This self-questionnaire concerns the patient's feelings about the therapeutic alliance and includes eleven items, placing the patient on 5-point scale on : the patient's feeling about the doctor's ability to help him/her; his/her understanding of the symptoms of the illness; the psychological improvement felt; the adaptation to the doctor-patient relationship; the doctor's availability and competence; the clarity of the information given by the doctor and the understanding he/she shows; the doctor's desire of clinical improvement; the quality of the relationship and the understanding of psychological difficulties</description>

    <time_frame>3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>In order to evaluate the vulnerability and protective factors related to somatic the handicap will be evaluated by the EDSS. The EDSS quantifies disability in eight Functional Systems (FS) by assigning a Functional System Score in each of these functional systems.&#xD;
The clinical meaning of each possible result goes from 0.0: Normal Neurological Exam to 10.0: Death</description>

    <description>In order to evaluate the vulnerability and protective factors related to somatic disease fatigue will be evaluated. The items are scored on a 7 point scale with 1 = strongly disagree and 7= strongly agree. The minimum score = 9 and maximum score possible = 63. Higher the score = greater fatigue severity.</description>

    <description>In order to evaluate the vulnerability and protective factors related to somatic disease cognitive disorders will be evaluated The SDMT is a sign coding test that assesses attentional abilities (sustained attention and speed of processing information). Participants are required to use a coded key to match nine abstract symbols paired with numerical digits. The final score is the correct number of substitutions in 90 seconds, and scores range between 0 and 110.</description>

The Big Five personality traits is a suggested grouping for personality traits. The theory identifies five factors:&#xD;

conscientiousness (efficient/organized vs. extravagant/careless)&#xD;
extraversion (outgoing/energetic vs. solitary/reserved)&#xD;
