  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The budesonide / formoterol combination can be used both as a maintenance treatment and as a&#xD;
      maintenance and relief therapy (MART) where in the latter there is also anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      action in contrast to the use of SABA. This anti-inflammatory and soothing effect has been&#xD;
      recognized by the Global Initiatives for Asthma (GINA) guidelines and is recommended as a&#xD;
      palliative treatment for all types of asthma severity versus Short Acting Beta Agonists&#xD;
      (SABA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test results have shown that the invoked budesonide / formoterol combination therapy had a&#xD;
      similar (not lower) effect on the annual exacerbation rate, with lower exposure to ICS&#xD;
      compared to regular maintenance therapy with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), although&#xD;
      budesonide / formoterol therapy appeared to was inferior to ongoing asthma control. Another&#xD;
      study showed no inferiority of the stable budesonide / formoterol combination compared to&#xD;
      maintenance ICS plus the required SABA dosing regimen in reducing the annual severe&#xD;
      exacerbation rate in patients with mild asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receiving budesonide / formoterol as adjunctive therapy or as maintenance therapy&#xD;
      experienced a reduced incidence of exacerbations including asthma-related SAEs, compared with&#xD;
      patients receiving long acting beta agonists (LABAs) or SABAs as sedatives, ICS or ICS / LA&#xD;
      terbutaline or salbutamol. Studies have shown that patients spent more days without&#xD;
      palliative care, indicating a significant reduction in reliance on palliative care while&#xD;
      improving both disease control and daily functioning and well-being. Asthma symptoms and&#xD;
      nocturnal awakening were significantly reduced, and FEV1 levels before and after treatment&#xD;
      showed significant improvement in lung function and quality of life as shown by the AQLQ-S&#xD;
      questionnaire score. In addition, ICS / LABA therapy as a palliative or maintenance treatment&#xD;
      appears to be well tolerated and reduces the risk of severe exacerbations following exposure&#xD;
      to high doses of SABA which may mask the worsening of inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The meta-analysis of Rogliani et. al. showed that low dose (LD) to medium dose (MD) ICS /&#xD;
      LABA MART was as effective as HD ICS / LABA and SABA as needed treatments in reducing the&#xD;
      risk of severe asthma exacerbations and that MART was generally more effective than low dose&#xD;
      LD ICS / LABA + as needed LABA or SABA, or ICS / LABA as needed or ICS + as needed SABA&#xD;
      treatments. The efficacy of ICS / LABA as needed treatment in the risk of severe exacerbation&#xD;
      was significantly higher than ICS + as needed SABA treatment but not ICS / LABA + as needed&#xD;
      SABA in patients with mild to severe asthma. LD to MD MART and HD ICS / LABA + as needed SABA&#xD;
      were equally effective (P&gt; 0.05) in improving PEF, and more effective (P &lt;0.05) than LD ICS /&#xD;
      LABA + as needed SABA or LABA, ICS / LABA as needed, ICS + SABA as needed, and SABA as&#xD;
      needed. Administration of ICS / LABA as purely invasive use significantly improved (P &lt;0.05)&#xD;
      PEF compared to ICS + SABA as needed, LD ICS / LABA + SABA as needed, and SABA as needed&#xD;
      treatments. MART improved lung function and disease control compared to other invasive&#xD;
      therapies in patients with moderate asthma. In contrast, in patients with moderate to severe&#xD;
      asthma, LD to MD MART was partially more effective than other invasive therapies in improving&#xD;
      lung function and controlling asthma. No differences were found in the safety profile which&#xD;
      was measured as the risk of occurrence of YOU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of budesonide / formoterol as maintenance therapy and as-needed palliative&#xD;
      care could improve overall asthma control without the need for additional palliative care.&#xD;

      Pulmoton® is an inhaled combination of budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate in doses&#xD;
      of 100 / 6mcg, 200 / 6mcg, 400/12 mcg, administered by Elpenhaler®, a powder inhaler&#xD;
      developed in doses developed by the ELPEN. It has been approved as a bronchodilator in the&#xD;
      treatment of asthma where combination therapy (ICS / LABA) is appropriate in patients who are&#xD;
      not adequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroids and rely on short-acting inhaled&#xD;
      β2-stimulants or in patients already satisfactorily controlled with both corticosteroids.&#xD;
      long-acting β2-stimulants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmoton® is not recommended for the initial treatment of asthma. The dosage of the&#xD;
      individual components of Pulmoton® is separate and must be adjusted according to the severity&#xD;
      of the condition. This should be taken into account, not only when starting treatment with&#xD;
      stable combination products, but also when adjusting the maintenance dosage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose should be adjusted to the lowest possible, by which effective control of symptoms is&#xD;
      achieved and maintained. Patients should be re-evaluated regularly by their physician so that&#xD;
      the dose of Pulmoton® they receive remains the best possible. When long-term control of&#xD;
      symptoms is achieved with the lowest recommended dose, then in the next step only the inhaled&#xD;
      corticosteroid can be tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two alternatives to treating asthma with Pulmoton®:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Pulmoton® Maintenance Therapy: Pulmoton® is taken as a regular maintenance treatment along&#xD;
      with a separate rapid-acting bronchodilator to relieve symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Pulmoton® Maintenance and Relief Therapy: Pulmoton® is also taken as regular maintenance&#xD;
      and invocative treatment for symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further information on the efficacy and safety of the drug under study can be found in the&#xD;
      Product Characteristics Summary (SmPC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims of the study The GINA 2020 guidelines recommend, among other things, the symptom-driven&#xD;
      use of ICS / LABA (as needed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will record the use of budesonide / formoterol either as maintenance treatment or&#xD;
      / or as needed according to standard clinical practice and at the discretion of the treating&#xD;
      physician.&#xD;
