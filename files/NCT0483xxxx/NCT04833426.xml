  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sexual dysfunction is a common side effect of radical prostatectomy (RP) and has a&#xD;
      significant negative impact on quality of life. With age the testosterone level in men&#xD;
      declines; around 30% of men over 70 years of age meet the criteria of testosterone deficiency&#xD;
      (TD). The negative impact of both TD and RP on sexual performance are likely to add up. The&#xD;
      aim of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of testosterone replacement therapy&#xD;
      (TRT) on functional and oncological outcomes in testosterone deficient men following RP for&#xD;
      prostate cancer (PCa).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Radical prostatectomy (RP) is currently the most common treatment for&#xD;
      non-metastatic prostate cancer (PCa). Two frequent side effects of this procedure are urinary&#xD;
      incontinence and erectile dysfunction, both having a significant negative impact on quality&#xD;
      of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, it is known that with age the testosterone level in men declines. This does not&#xD;
      lead to symptoms in all men (asymptomatic testosterone deficiency). Both testosterone&#xD;
      deficiency (TD) and radical prostatectomy are well-established to have a significant negative&#xD;
      impact on sexual performance and are likely to add up in patients with a low testosterone&#xD;
      following RP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The aim of this study is to assess the effect of testosterone replacement therapy&#xD;
      (TRT) on functional and oncological outcomes in testosterone deficient men following RP for&#xD;
      PCa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: This study is a phase 3 prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      single-blind clinical trial. Study population: All men over 18 years old diagnosed with&#xD;
      non-metastatic prostate cancer who are scheduled for RP within three months as primary&#xD;
      treatment, can be prescreened for inclusion. Prior to the RP, serum testosterone will be&#xD;
      determined. Subsequently, within six weeks after the RP, serum testosterone will be&#xD;
      determined again and patients will be screened for inclusion. If necessary, a third&#xD;
      measurement of testosterone will be done. Eligible patients meet the criteria for TD and&#xD;
      other inclusion criteria. Intervention: Patients will be randomized for testosterone&#xD;
      replacement therapy (TRT) or placebo as a daily administered topical gel starting within 8&#xD;
      weeks after RP. Patients will receive TRT or placebo for one year following RP and will be&#xD;
      monitored for another year for functional outcomes and for four more years to establish&#xD;
      5-year biochemical recurrence (BCR) free survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary study endpoint is a clinically relevant (12 points or more) difference in the&#xD;
      EPIC-26 domain for sexual functioning 12 months after RP in favor of testosterone deficient&#xD;
      men receiving TRT compared with testosterone deficient men receiving placebo. Secondary&#xD;
      endpoints include: urinary incontinence score, hormonal functioning score and BCR-free&#xD;
      survival. Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit&#xD;
      and group relatedness: The number of visits and blood drawings are equal to standard of care&#xD;
      follow-up after RP, with the exception of two or three extra blood samples at the first&#xD;
      prescreening visit and within six weeks following RP. We ask patients to remain with their&#xD;
      hospital for 24 months after RP for follow-up and to complete online questionnaires for the&#xD;
      given visits. The five-year biochemical recurrence (BCR) free survival will be obtained&#xD;
      through patient's medical records and if insufficient, through the Dutch Cancer Registry&#xD;
      (NKR). Patients who receive TRT or placebo can experience local side-effects such as itching,&#xD;
      rash and/or irritation at the site of application. In addition, patients who receive TRT can&#xD;
      experience systemic sideeffects are gain of weight, hot flashes, acne and an increase in red&#xD;
      blood count level. Furthermore, TRT might improve sexual functioning, urinary continence,&#xD;
      hormonal functioning and BCR-free survival, but this is not certain and is subject of&#xD;
      research in this study.&#xD;
