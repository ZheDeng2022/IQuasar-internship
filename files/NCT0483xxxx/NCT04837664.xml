  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cigarette smoking in conjugation with bad oral hygiene is considered a typical predisposing&#xD;
      factor for many oral diseases including denture stomatitis. This study investigated the&#xD;
      effect of Rose Bengal (RB)-and Curcumin (CUR)-mediated photodynamic therapy (PDT) in&#xD;
      comparison with nystatin therapy in the intervention of denture stomatitis in cigarette&#xD;
      smokers. Overall, 45 habitual cigarette smokers aged ~58 years having denture stomatitis were&#xD;
      categorized into three groups: Group-I - RB-mediated PDT, Group-II - CUR-mediated PDT, and&#xD;
      Group-III - Nystatin therapy. The primary outcome of the interest was: counts of Candida&#xD;
      colony from denture surface and palatal mucosa, calculated as CFU/mL, whereas the prevalence&#xD;
      of Candida species determined in 3 research groups comprised the secondary outcome. Oral swab&#xD;
      specimens were gathered from the denture surfaces and palatal mucosa. All clinical&#xD;
      assessments were performed at baseline, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks. C. albicans was the most&#xD;
      prevalent yeast identified on both denture surfaces and palatal mucosa, followed by C.&#xD;
      tropicalis and C. glabrata. A considerable decrease in the CFU/mL scores were observed in&#xD;
      Group-I and Group-II at the end of the interventions and on the 12-week follow-up (p&lt;0.05).&#xD;
      Group-I, II, and III demonstrated clinical efficacy rates of 53%, 51%, and 49%, respectively.&#xD;
      CUR-and RB-mediated PDT was found to be as effective as topical Nystatin therapy for the&#xD;
      intervention of denture stomatitis among cigarette smokers.&#xD;

    <description>Participants belonging to the rose bengal mediated photodynamic therapy, their dentures and oral cavity were illuminated using the LED device for 26 minutes (37.5 J/cm2). The photosensitizer rose bengal was sprayed on the palate and dentures for half-hour. To irradiate the palate, the investigator handled the other LED device; the circular platform having LEDs was put within the patient's oral cavity and the illumination of the palate was carried out for 20 minutes (122 J/cm2). The PDT was carried out thrice per week for a half month (6 sessions) in each participant.</description>
