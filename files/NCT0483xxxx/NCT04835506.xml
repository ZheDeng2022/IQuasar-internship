  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The OPTIMIZE Trial compares whether iDose dashboard-driven infliximab dosing (iDose-driven&#xD;
      dosing) is more effective and safer than standard infliximab dosing for inducing and&#xD;
      maintaining disease remission in moderately to severely active CD.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preliminary data show that proactive IFX optimization to achieve a threshold drug&#xD;
      concentration during maintenance therapy (even if the patient is asymptomatic) compared to&#xD;
      empiric dose escalation and/or reactive TDM is associated with better long-term outcomes&#xD;
      including longer drug persistence, reduced risk of relapse, and fewer hospitalizations and&#xD;
      surgeries. IFX dosing by weight only (i.e., mg/kg) may not be adequate for many patients as&#xD;
      interindividual variability in drug clearance and other factors affecting IFX concentrations&#xD;
      and PK are often not accounted for. Dosing calculators take into account all of these&#xD;
      individual factors and improve the precision of dosing towards better personalized medicine.&#xD;
      These systems have already been validated, and personalized dosing has shown clinical benefit&#xD;
      in patients with IBD.&#xD;

             coagulation, immunological, endocrine/metabolic, or other medical disorder that, in&#xD;
             the opinion of the investigator, might confound the study results, pose additional&#xD;
             risk to the subject, or interfere with the subject's ability to participate fully in&#xD;
