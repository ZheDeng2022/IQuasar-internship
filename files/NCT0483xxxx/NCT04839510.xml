  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of MRG002 as single agent in patients with HER2-positive unresectable locally&#xD;
      advanced or metastatic urothelium cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of two stages. In Phase IIa, approximately 25 subjects will be enrolled to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and preliminarily efficacy of MRG002. Based on the initial safety and&#xD;
      efficacy data obtained from the Phase IIa, the study design of second stage Phase IIb&#xD;
      single-arm study either will be continued or the trail will be terminated. If the Phase IIa&#xD;
      data support the continuation of the study, in the second stage, approximately an additional&#xD;
      33 subjects will be enrolled to further evaluate the efficacy and safety of MRG002.&#xD;
