    <textblock>
      Chronic ankle instability (CAI) is a condition that often develops after repeated ankle&#xD;
      sprains, increasing the susceptibility of the ankle to move into excessive inversion when&#xD;
      walking on unsteady surfaces. Approximately 74% of acute ankle sprains result in persistent&#xD;
      symptoms, 30% of which progress to chronic ankle instability. Arthroscopic examination and&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are considered the two most accurate methods of diagnosing&#xD;
      injuries to lateral collateral ligaments. Ultrasound has been proven able to detect soft&#xD;
      tissue injuries, However, the use of ultrasound and its' ability to accurately diagnose CAI&#xD;
      is still under debate. The aim of this study is to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of&#xD;
      ultrasonography for the assessment of non-osseous lateral ankle instability in comparison&#xD;
      with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).&#xD;

      Chronic ankle instability (CAI) is a condition that often develops after repeated ankle&#xD;
      sprains, increasing the susceptibility of the ankle to move into excessive inversion when&#xD;
      walking on unsteady surfaces. Approximately 74% of acute ankle sprains result in persistent&#xD;
      symptoms, 30% of which progress to chronic ankle instability.[1-3] CAI is diagnosed in&#xD;
      individuals who report pain and tenderness on the lateral aspect of the ankle, or persistent&#xD;
      swelling and discomfort for greater than six months with a history of re-injury or clinical&#xD;
      instability of the ankle joint.[4, 5] The primary cause of damage to the structural stability&#xD;
      of the ankle joint is trauma by forced inversion and plantarflexion. The lateral collateral&#xD;
      ligaments, which are more commonly affected by acute sprains, include the anterior&#xD;
      talofibular ligament (ATFL), the calcaneofibular ligament (CFL), and the posterior&#xD;
      talofibular ligament (PTFL). The ATFL is primarily responsible for preventing excessive&#xD;
      supination and anterior translation, while also restricting plantar flexion and internal&#xD;
      rotation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Common diagnostic tools used to identify ankle instability include clinical testing (like&#xD;
      Anterior Drawer Test), imaging and arthroscopy. Arthroscopic examination and magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI) are considered the two most accurate methods of diagnosing injuries&#xD;
      to lateral collateral ligaments. [7] In a retrospective study conducted by Joshy et al., in&#xD;
      which 24 patients underwent arthroscopy and MRI of the ankle, MRI was found to have both high&#xD;
      specificity (100%) and high sensitivity (100%) for ATFL disruption. [8-10] Ultrasound has&#xD;
      been proven able to detect soft tissue injuries, and has even become the gold standard for&#xD;
      the detection of injuries to the patellar and Achilles tendons. [2, 11] However, the use of&#xD;
      ultrasound and its' ability to accurately diagnose CAI is still under debate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When imaging the ankle, ultrasound should be able to detect synovial lesions, ligamentous&#xD;
      injury, and distinguish soft tissue from osseous impingement.[8] Dynamic ultrasound should be&#xD;
      also used to discover dislocation of the peroneal tendons, or intra-sheath dislocation, which&#xD;
      is indicated by an intact retinaculum with subluxation of the peroneal tendons within the&#xD;
      groove.[11] Aim of the work: The aim of this study is to investigate the diagnostic accuracy&#xD;
      of ultrasonography for the assessment of non-osseous lateral ankle instability in comparison&#xD;
      with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      fifty four patients complaining of acute or chronic lateral ankle instability will be&#xD;
      included in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients complaining of acute or chronic lateral ankle instability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Previous ankle surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interventional intra-articular procedures (previous arthroscope, injections)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Systemic inflammatory disorders (collagen diseases)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diagnosed osseous lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be subjected to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thorough history taking and clinical provisional diagnosis. Plain X-ray of the affected ankle&#xD;
      in AP and lateral views to exclude any osseous lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Real-time high resolution ultrasonography of the affected ankle joint MRI for the affected&#xD;
      ankle joint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound Technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ultrasonographic examination of the ankle begins with the patient in supine position.&#xD;
      Longitudinal scanning of the ankle was first performed to get an overall view of the&#xD;
      tibio-talar joint and to detect joint effusion. Thereafter, slight inversion of the foot is&#xD;
      performed while the patient in the same position to examine the lateral collateral ligaments&#xD;
      and peroneal tendons. The Anterior talo-fibular ligament (ATFL) is first examined in oblique&#xD;
      transverse plane from the tip of lateral malleolus, antero-medially and slightly downward,&#xD;
      till the talus. Then, the Calcaneo Fibular ligament (CFL) is examined in oblique longitudinal&#xD;
      plane from the lateral malleolar tip downward and slightly backward to the lateral surface of&#xD;
      the calcaneus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding the peroneal tendons, they are examined from their supra-malleolar&#xD;
      musculo-tendinous junction, and then just behind the lateral malleolus till their&#xD;
      infra-malleolar course in both longitudinal and transverse planes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI examination All patients will have MRI imaging of the affected ankle(s) on a high&#xD;
      field-strength scanners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Positioning:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every patient lies supine with the ankle and foot in neutral position and plantar flexion of&#xD;
      20-30 degrees for reducing the &quot;magic angle&quot; artifact. No movement allowed during examination&#xD;
      by supporting the ankle using pads.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients are examined by different pulse sequences including T1, T2, proton density,&#xD;
      gradient echo and STIR. The examinations will be done in different planes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our usual protocol of examination is Sagittal T1WIs, Axial T1WIs T2WIs and proton density&#xD;
      images, coronal T1WIs as well as Sagittal or coronal STIR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other parameters applied include slice thickness ranged from 3 to 5 mm, matrix 256/192 or&#xD;
      512/224, number of excitation 2 to 3 and field of view ranged from 12 to 16 cm, better kept&#xD;
      &lt;14 cm.&#xD;
