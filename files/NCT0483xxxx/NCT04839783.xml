  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to systematically, prospectively compare surgical fusion&#xD;
      techniques for thoracolumbar spinal fusion patients and assess long-term patient outcomes and&#xD;
      revision rates following surgery.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to understand how the difference in positioning of a patient&#xD;
      intraoperatively, as part of performing an anterior posterior spine fusion surgery, can&#xD;
      affect short term and long term outcomes. This will be accomplished through observational&#xD;
      techniques that will not affect the care patients will receive for their spinal conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be asked to complete health and wellness surveys before and after survey to&#xD;
      determine how they are doing before surgery and then what if any changes their respective&#xD;
      surgeries have had on their lives. Further spine x-rays that they have taken to plan their&#xD;
      surgeries and assess their recovery will be measured, when available. X-rays will not be&#xD;
      taken only for research purposes. Additionally aspects of their surgeries will be noted such&#xD;
      as where hardware is placed and how long different parts of the surgery took.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up is planned to be out to 10 years post-operatively with the goal of collecting&#xD;
      information about any revision spine surgeries that would happen during those 10 years as&#xD;
      well.&#xD;
