      A retrospective, multi-centre, observational study to describe the treatment patterns, the&#xD;
      demographic, clinical outcomes, treatment effectiveness, and healthcare resource utilization&#xD;
      (HCRU) for patients diagnosed with primary Small Cell Lung Cancer SCLC (Extensive stage &amp;&#xD;
      Limited Stage)and stage III NSCLC in a real-world setting&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort of patients diagnosed with primary SCLC (limited or extensive stage) or stage III&#xD;
      NSCLC, aims to characterize the treatment patterns from the index date (defined as the date&#xD;
      of initial diagnosis of locally advanced stage III NSCLC and SCLC) to the end of follow-up&#xD;
      (defined as the earliest of death, last available medical record or end of the observation&#xD;
      period &quot;defined as the date of data abstraction&quot;) including the type of treatment received,&#xD;
      duration of each treatment regimen, and reasons for stopping treatment regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will be identified by participating physicians involved in the&#xD;
      diagnosis, treatment and management of these patients through the review of established&#xD;
      patient medical records. Eligible patients (both alive and deceased) will have their data&#xD;
      anonymously abstracted from their medical records into a centrally designed electronic case&#xD;
      report form (eCRF).&#xD;
