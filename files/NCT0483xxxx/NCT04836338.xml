      The overall purpose of this study is to assess the functionality &amp; impact of the use of the&#xD;
      newly designed GlideScope Spectrum pediatric video laryngoscope blades and stylet for the&#xD;
      orotracheal intubation of neonates and pediatric patients, utilizing manikin models. The&#xD;
      hypothesis is that the Spectrum laryngoscope blades and stylet can improve the time and/or&#xD;
      success of orotracheal intubation in a manikin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aims of this study include assessing the impact of Spectrum pediatric video&#xD;
      laryngoscope blades under simulated normal and difficult airway conditions on glottic view&#xD;
      grade, mouth space, ease of blade insertion, ease of tracheal tube insertion, mechanisms of&#xD;
      tracheal tube insertion impediment, and perceived overall clinical &amp; functional usefulness in&#xD;
      airways with predictors of difficult intubation.&#xD;

    <description>Overall performance and clinical utility of single-use pediatric stylet; Using a 5-point LIKERT SCALE, participants will grade the following statements with regards to the use of the single-use pediatric stylet&#xD;

e.g. - Participants will assign a number to the following statements:&#xD;
The pediatric style was easy to insert into the mouth of the when used with normal neonate manikin&#xD;
The pediatric style was easy to insert into the mouth of the when used with the difficult neonate manikin&#xD;

    <description>The time taken for an intubation attempt that ultimately fails proper tube placement, or exceeds the allowed time for intubation under this protocol. Failed intubation attempt is defined as an attempt to intubate that does not result in tube placement, that is longer than 120 seconds, or results in a wrong placement of endotracheal tube (For example: Esophageal intubation, etc.).</description>

    <description>Glottic view grade on each of 3 attempts per blade, on each manikin type using the Cormack &amp; Lehane grading scale:&#xD;
Grade 1 = Full view of vocal cords&#xD;
Grade 2a = Partial view of vocal cords&#xD;
Grade 2b = Only arytenoids/posterior part of vocal cords&#xD;
