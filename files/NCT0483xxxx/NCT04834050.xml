  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Quadriceps femoris (QF) atrophy is seen in rheumatoid arthritis and knee osteoarthritis (OA)&#xD;
      patients. Exercise therapy is mile stone in knee OA patients also it can help thicken QF&#xD;
      muscle of RA patients. We primarily aimed to demonstrate the influence of 4 weeks of knee&#xD;
      isometric home-based training on QF muscle parts thickness and pennation angle measurements&#xD;
      of RA patients with ultrasonography (USG). This study included 12 patients with RA, 12&#xD;
      patients with knee OA as positive control group and 13 volunteers as healthy control group.&#xD;
      All participants were given 4 weeks of quadriceps-hamstring isometric home-based training. At&#xD;
      baseline and at the end of the program, WOMAC and Lequesne algofunctional index scores of&#xD;
      knee OA patients and DAS28-CRP scores of RA patients were recorded. Dominant knee thickness&#xD;
      and pennation angle measurements of QF muscle parts were evaluated by ultrasonography.&#xD;

    <measure>Change of The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) score of knee OA</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and after 4 weeks of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) scores of knee OA patients were calculated at baseline and at the end of exercise program. The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) is divided into 3 subscales: Pain, stiffness, physical function. The scores for each subscale are summed up, with a possible score range of 0-20 for Pain, 0-8 for Stiffness, and 0-68 for Physical Function. A sum of scores of 3 subscales were multipled with 100 and divided by 96 and resulted in WOMAC score of the patients.&#xD;
Higher scores on the WOMAC indicate worse pain, stiffness, and functional limitations.</description>

    <time_frame>At baseline and after 4 weeks of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Disease activity score 28-C reactive protein (DAS28-CRP) scores of RA patients were calculated at baseline and at the end of program. A score lower than 2.6 means remission, score between 2.6 and 3.2 means low disease activity, score between 3.2 and 5.1 means moderate disease activity and score higher than 5.1 means high disease activity.</description>

    <description>Lequesne algofunctional index scores of knee OA patients were calculated at baseline and at the end of the intervention. The Lequesne OA index is scored as the sum of questions ranging from 0 to 24, higher scores meaning worse outcome.</description>

    <description>All 3 groups of participants were given 4-week (5 days/week) quadriceps-hamstring isometric home-based exercise training for their both knees. Exercises were performed (with maximal effort for 10 seconds) at a rate of 20 repetitions per day. Training was performed at outpatient clinic for 30 minutes.</description>
