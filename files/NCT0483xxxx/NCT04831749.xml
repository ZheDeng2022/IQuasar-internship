      The aim of the present study is to translate the Quebec Back Pain Disability Scale into&#xD;
      Pashto, Punjabi, Sindhi and Balochi languages. Along with validation of the translated&#xD;
      versions by evaluating their validity and reliability in the people of Pakistan, speaking&#xD;
      respective languages and suffering from low back pain. No such study has been previously&#xD;
      conducted in the Pakistan region which translates the scale and follows the proper&#xD;
      cross-culture adaptation.&#xD;

      The Quebec Back Pain Disability Scale is a first-hand measure of functional disability for&#xD;
      patients with back pain. It distinguishes itself from other published scales as it has an&#xD;
      approach that deals with the concepts of disability and its assessment. Its major aim is to&#xD;
      be a responsive measure of functional disability in back pain. Quebec back pain disability&#xD;
      Questionnaire has unique strong characteristics that are quite feasibly used and have good&#xD;
      identification properties regarding Low Back Pain. There is extensive usage, applicability,&#xD;
      and validity of QBPDS in research and clinical practice. Along with these factors the&#xD;
      capability of the QBPDS to identify significant fluctuations in patient's condition, makes&#xD;
      its use evidently advocated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quebec Pain disability scale, originally a French scale has been translated and validated&#xD;
      into a few languages before. Previous studies have shown that the translation of the scale&#xD;
      would end up giving a standard measure to be utilized in clinical practices and research&#xD;
      studies while sanctioning clinicians and specialists to share information and to study&#xD;
      effects of treatments in low back pain patients. Along with helping in appraisals of outcomes&#xD;
      amongst various populations. So, to gather the best outcomes of this questionnaire in&#xD;
      Pakistan region it is imperative to translate it into Pashto, Punjabi, Sindhi and Balochi&#xD;
      hence the local languages.&#xD;

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>To determine reliability and validity of cross-culturally adapted and the translated QBPDS versions in patients with low back pain of respective languages€î Reliability or reproducibility refers to the ability of a measure to produce the same results when administered at two or more interval between different visits of the patient and validity is how accurate the results are. Thus these both are to measured through various parameters to validate the translated versions as appropriate and applicable.</description>
