  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Enterobacteriaceae, more specifically Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, are the&#xD;
      bacteria most often responsible for neonatal infections in low-income countries. Infections&#xD;
      caused by multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae: Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing&#xD;
      Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-E), are more often associated with an unfavorable outcome of the&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enterobacteriaceae colonize the digestive tract which is the first step in developing a&#xD;
      potential infection. Very few studies have been carried out at the community level.&#xD;
      Colonization of the mother with ESBL-E is generally considered to be a major route of&#xD;
      acquisition. The carrying of ESBL-E by other family members and other potential sources of&#xD;
      transmission (food, objects and surfaces in contact with the newborn) have never been&#xD;
      documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, with a view to offering an intervention adapted to the local context, the local&#xD;
      cultural determinants which govern the interactions of the newborn with his environment are&#xD;
      important to understand.&#xD;

      This is a single-center prospective cohort of all members living in the same household in&#xD;
      which a newborn baby has just been born.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  recruit a cohort of all members of 60 households in which a newborn has just been born&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  carry out semi-structured interviews and direct participant observation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is divided in two parts :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the epidemiological part : the documentation of colonization by E-ESBL by sampling the&#xD;
           stools of the newborn, of all members of the household, and sampling of food given to&#xD;
           the child, from surfaces in contact with it.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the anthropological part : Semi-structured interviews with key people in the structuring&#xD;
           of the social and family environment of the newborn and participant direct observation&#xD;
           of households.&#xD;
