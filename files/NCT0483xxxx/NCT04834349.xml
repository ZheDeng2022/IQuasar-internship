    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the effect of re-irradiation with NBTXR3 in combination with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab in treating patients with head and neck squamous cell cancer that cannot be&#xD;
      removed by surgery (inoperable) and has come back (recurrent). NBTXR3 is a drug that is&#xD;
      designed to improve the effectiveness (how well something works) of radiation therapy. The&#xD;
      drug is injected into a tumor and activated (turned on) by radiation. Stereotactic body&#xD;
      radiation therapy uses special equipment to position a patient and deliver radiation to&#xD;
      tumors with high precision. This method may kill tumor cells with fewer doses over a shorter&#xD;
      period and cause less damage to normal tissue. Radiation therapy, such as intensity modulated&#xD;
      radiation therapy or intensity modulated proton therapy, uses high energy to kill tumor cells&#xD;
      and shrink tumors. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help&#xD;
      the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells&#xD;
      to grow and spread. Giving NBTXR3 activated by radiation together with pembrolizumab may help&#xD;
      to control head and neck squamous cell cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate progression free survival (PFS) and early clinical benefit in patients treated&#xD;
      with hafnium oxide-containing nanoparticles NBTXR3 (NBTXR3) activated by stereotactic body&#xD;
      radiation therapy (SBRT) reirradiation, with concurrent pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the safety profile and estimate early clinical benefit of NBXTR3 activated by&#xD;
      dose reduction intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) or intensity modulated proton&#xD;
      therapy (IMPT) reirradiation with concurrent pembrolizumab, in subjects with locoregional&#xD;
      recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) not eligible for SBRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate tumor response after NBTXR3 activated by SBRT reirradiation with concurrent&#xD;
      pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate tumor response after NBTXR3 activated by dose reduction IMRT/IMPT&#xD;
      reirradiation with concurrent pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the safety profile of NBTXR3 activated by SBRT reirradiation with concurrent&#xD;
      pembrolizumab.&#xD;

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate lymphedema/fibrosis &amp; dysphagia-related toxicities and functional outcomes of&#xD;
      treatment with NBTXR3 activated by SBRT or IMRT or IMPT reirradiation and concurrent&#xD;
      pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess functional and patient reported outcomes (PRO) of treatment with NBTXR3&#xD;
      activated by SBRT or IMRT or IMPT reirradiation and concurrent pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To associate radiomic measurements with outcomes of treatment with NBTXR3 activated by&#xD;
      SBRT or IMRT or IMPT reirradiation and concurrent pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate biomarkers of response in subjects treated with NBTXR3 activated by SBRT or&#xD;
      IMRT or IMPT reirradiation and concurrent pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT I: Patients receive NBTXR3 intratumorally (IT) on day 1. Patients then undergo SBRT&#xD;
      every other day (QOD) on days 15-29. Beginning the first day of radiation therapy, patients&#xD;
      also receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat every 3&#xD;
      weeks for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT II: Patients receive NBTXR3 IT on day 1. Patients then undergo IMRT/IMPT every day&#xD;
      (QD) on days 15-50. Beginning the first day of radiation therapy, patients also receive&#xD;
      pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat every 3 weeks for up to 2 years in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and&#xD;
      then every 6 months for up to 5 years.&#xD;

Lymphedema/Fibrosis Grading: Clinician-grading of lymphedema/fibrosis will be conducted according to the published Head and Neck-Lymphedema Fibrosis (HN-LEF) per physical examination of the patient. Clinical grading is a brief assessment that can be completed in &lt; 5 minutes.</description>

Cervical range of motion (CROM): A goniometer will measure CROM (degrees) to assess active cervical spine ROM. Five core CROM measures will be collected, including cervical extension, sagittal plane at rest, lateral flexion (left/right), coronal plane at rest, and lateral rotation (left/right). The primary CROM measure of interest is cervical extension. Cervical extension measures are highly reliable (ICC=.90). Average extension measures in healthy adults aged 60 to 69 range from 57 degrees in males (SD: 10.5) to 65 degrees in females (SD: 13.3). Cervical extension measures decrease by approximately 5 degrees for each decade of life[41].</description>

Lymphedema Symptom Intensity and Distress Survey - Head and Neck (LSIDS-H&amp;N)25 is a 64-item instrument designed to assess lymphedema symptoms in head and neck cancer patients. Survey items were selected to address six domains (head and neck-specific functioning, systemic symptoms, psychosocial issues, altered sensation symptoms, neck-shoulder musculoskeletal/skin symptoms, and miscellaneous symptoms) identified by an expert panel. Preliminary testing of LSIDS-H&amp;N demonstrated both feasibility and readability.</description>
