  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this prospective study, we aimed to investigate whether serum and abdominal washing fluid&#xD;
      CA-125 levels correlated with postoperative histopathological parameters in patients with&#xD;
      endometrial carcinoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endometrial cancer was diagnosed with histopathological examination of the samples obtained&#xD;
      by dilatation and curettage. Preoperative serum CA-125 levels were determined in all&#xD;
      patients. Serum and abdominal washing fluid CA-125 levels were measured with a double&#xD;
      antibody sandwich immunoenzymatic method, using Beckman Coulter DXI (Ireland) analyzer. In&#xD;
      addition to routine preoperative investigations, MRI was done in patients who were thought to&#xD;
      have an extension outside the uterus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During surgery, abdominal exploration was performed first, and then an abdominal fluid sample&#xD;
      was obtained for cytological examination and measurement of CA-125 level. One hundred&#xD;
      milliliters of normal saline was used as the abdominal washing liquid to obtain the sample&#xD;
      for CA-125 measurement. Subsequently, total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral&#xD;
      salpingo-oophorectomy (TAH + BSO) were performed.&#xD;
