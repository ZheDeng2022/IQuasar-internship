  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate night-driving performance in real-world driving&#xD;
      conditions in participants with presbyopia treated with AGN-190584 versus vehicle. Adverse&#xD;
      events and change in disease symptoms will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AGN-190584 is an investigational formulation of pilocarpine for treating symptoms associated&#xD;
      with presbyopia as a topical, once-daily eyedrop delivered by a proprietary vehicle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study consists of two parts. Part 1 consists of Visit 2 and Visit 3, and Part 2 consists&#xD;
      of Visit 4 and Visit 5. Approximately half of the participants will receive AGN-190584 at&#xD;
      Visit 2 through Visit 3 (Sequence 1 participants) and the remaining participants (Sequence 2&#xD;
      participants) will receive AGN-190584 at Visit 4 through Visit 5. All participants will&#xD;
      receive AGN-190584 at home as instructed. Approximately 54 adult participants with presbyopia&#xD;
      will be enrolled AT 1 site in Australia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment duration is expected to be no more than 71 days. In Part 1, at Visit 2 (Day 1) and&#xD;
      at home as instructed for 7 to 14 days Sequence 1 participants will receive 1 eyedrop of&#xD;
      AGN-190584 in each eye and Sequence 2 participants will receive 1 eyedrop of vehicle in each&#xD;
      eye. All participants will have a driving assessment at Visit 3 (Day 8 to 15). In Part 2, at&#xD;
      Visit 4 (Day 15 to 57) and at home as instructed for 7 to 14 days Sequence 2 participants&#xD;
      will receive 1 eyedrop of AGN-190584 in each eye and Sequence 1 participants will receive 1&#xD;
      eyedrop of vehicle in each eye. All participants will have a driving assessment at Visit 5&#xD;
      (Day 22 to 71).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their&#xD;
      standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the course of the study at a&#xD;
      hospital or clinic. The effects of the treatment will be checked by medical assessments,&#xD;
      asking about side effects, and completing questionnaires.&#xD;

    <description>An overall composite driving Z score approximately 1 hour after study intervention instillation will be derived to capture the overall driving performance of each participant compared with the whole group from the following parameters: percent hazards hit, percent sign recognition and recognition distance, pedestrian recognition distances, and percent of time outside of the lane.</description>

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. The investigator assesses the relationship of each event to the use of the study intervention. A serious adverse event (SAE) is an event that results in death, is life threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongs an existing hospitalization, results in a congenital anomaly, persistent or significant disability/incapacity or is an important medical event, that based on medical judgment, may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed above. Treatment-emergent adverse events/ treatment emergent serious adverse events (TEAEs/TESAEs) are defined as any event that began or worsened in severity on or after the first dose of the study drug.</description>
