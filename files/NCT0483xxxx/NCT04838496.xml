  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite developments in the multidisciplinary treatment of patients with locally advanced&#xD;
      rectal cancer (LARC), such as the introduction of total mesorectal excision (TME) by Heald et&#xD;
      al. and the shift from adjuvant to neoadjuvant (chemo)radiotherapy ((C)RT), local and distant&#xD;
      recurrence rates remain between 5-10% and 25-40% respectively. Several studies established&#xD;
      tumour characteristics with particularly bad prognosis; it was demonstrated that the&#xD;
      occurrence of mesorectal fascia involvement (MRF+), grade 4 extramural venous invasion&#xD;
      (EMVI), tumour deposits (TD) and enlarged lateral lymph nodes (LLN) lead to high local and&#xD;
      distant recurrence rates and decreased survival when compared with LARC without these&#xD;
      particularly negative prognostic factors. This type of LARC is described as high risk LARC&#xD;
      (hr-LARC). Achieving a resection with clear resection margins (R0) is an important prognostic&#xD;
      factor for local (LR) and distant recurrence (DM) as well as survival. With the aim to&#xD;
      further reduce the risk of recurrent rectal cancer, to diminish distant metastasis and to&#xD;
      improve overall survival for patients with LARC, induction chemotherapy (ICT) became a&#xD;
      growing area of research. The addition of ICT has the ability to induce more local tumour&#xD;
      downstaging, possibly leading to resectability of previously unresectable tumours, more R0&#xD;
      resections and less extensive surgery. In the case of a complete clinical response, surgery&#xD;
      may even be omitted. ICT may also have the potential to eradicate micrometastases. Hence,&#xD;
      increased local downstaging and reducing distant metastatic spread may reduce LR and DM rates&#xD;
      and improve survival and quality of life. In recent years, the use of ICT was investigated&#xD;
      and showed promising results, but little is known about the addition of ICT in patients with&#xD;
      high risk LARC. Since these patients have a particularly bad prognosis, both with regard to&#xD;
      locoregional and distant failure, a more intensified neoadjuvant treatment with FOLFOXIRI is&#xD;
      anticipated to improve short- and long term results.&#xD;

    <measure>The main study parameter is the proportion of patients with a pathological complete response (pCR) and those patients who started a wait and see strategy and have sustained clinical complete response (cCR) at 1 year.</measure>
    <time_frame>pCR is determined after surgery directly. There is a cCR in case of a sustained clinical response until at least one year after chemoradiotherapy</time_frame>
    <description>The pCR is evaluated by an experienced pathologist. A pCR is defined as the absence of residual tumour cells in the complete resected specimen including all resected regional lymph nodes (ypT0N0). A cCR is defined as the absence of viable tumour tissue based on MRI, evaluated by an experienced radiologist. There is a cCR in case of a sustained clinical response at 1 year after chemoradiotherapy.</description>

    <description>All patients will receive induction chemotherapy consisting of 4-6 cycles of FOLFOXIRI. Restaging will be performed after 4 cycles with a pelvic MRI and a thoraco-abdominal CT-scan. In case of stable or responsive disease, the remaining 2 cycles of FOLFOXIRI will be provided. In case of progressive, but still resectable disease, chemoradiation will be provided immediately, without the remaining 2 cycles of FOLFOXIRI. Restaging will be performed after chemoradiation. In case of resectable disease, surgery is performed.</description>

    <intervention_name>FOLFOXIRI Protocol</intervention_name>
    <description>FOLFOXIRI consists of oxaliplatin, irinotecan, leucovorin and 5-fluorouracil and is administered every 2 weeks:&#xD;
Dosing:&#xD;
Day 1: irinotecan 165 mg/m2 body-surface area (BSA) intravenously (IV), followed by oxaliplatin 85mg/m2 BSA IV in combination with leucovorin 400mg/m2 BSA, followed by:&#xD;
Day 1-2: 3200 mg/m2 BSA of continuous 5-fluorouracil IV&#xD;
Day 3-14: rest days.&#xD;
Both regimen are initially administered for four cycles. In case of responsive or stable disease, a 5th and 6th cycle of FOLFOXIRI will be administered.&#xD;
In case of unacceptable toxicity, the aforementioned dosages can be reduced or one or more chemotherapeutical agents can be omitted at discretion of the medical oncologist and will be noted in the patient's medical file. At discretion of the medical oncologist, a start dosage of 75% of the advised dosage could be considered in patients above 70 years of age.</description>
