  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia (FM) is a very common but mysterious pain disorder characterized by chronic&#xD;
      widespread muscular pain. Fatigue, anxiety and depression are common comorbidities. The&#xD;
      syndrome is commonly associated with several symptoms, including fatigue, sleeping&#xD;
      disturbance, cognitive impairment, and comorbid pain syndrome, especially irritable bowel&#xD;
      symptoms and temporomandibular disease. Anxiety and depression are common psychiatric&#xD;
      co-morbidies. Daily stress is believed to trigger or aggravate pain conditions. These&#xD;
      symptoms can markedly affect patients' quality of life, and even lead to disability. So far,&#xD;
      the etiology and pathogenesis are largely unknown, and diagnostic biomarkers and curative&#xD;
      treatment remain to be developed. Recent technological advances enable scientists to explore&#xD;
      mechanisms by genetic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic researches. However, no&#xD;
      definitive result has been concluded for clinical practice so far.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators use tailored questionnaires to evaluate fibromyalgia and&#xD;
      associated symptoms, including numeric rating scale for soreness, widespread soreness index,&#xD;
      Fibromyalgia impact questionnaire, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and perceived&#xD;
      stress scale. The investigators also use metabolomics and lipidomic approach to probe the&#xD;
      potential pathophysiology of fibromyalgia. In our prior translation research (PMID:&#xD;
      32907805), the investigators found that excessive LPC16:0 resulting from lipid oxidization&#xD;
      inflicts psychological stress-induced chronic non-inflammatory pain via activating ASIC3. In&#xD;
      this content, our prior translational research identified a potential nociceptive ligand that&#xD;
      causes fibromyalgia symptoms, which is likely to function as biomarkers for diagnosis or&#xD;
      disease monitor. In the current clinical investigation, the investigators aim to reversely&#xD;
      translate the novel findings in animal studies and validate the bio-significance of LPC16:0&#xD;
      for fibromyalgia with clinical approaches.&#xD;
