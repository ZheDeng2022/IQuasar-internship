  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      99 patients age 12 to &lt;18 years old with obesity (BMI &gt;/=95th percentile), will be randomized&#xD;
      to one of three treatment interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Usual Care&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Usual Care plus advice to weigh daily on simple scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Usual Care plus advice to weigh-daily on an EHR-connected scale&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survey data collected at baseline, 2, 4, 6, and 12-weeks, and qualitative interviews at 12&#xD;
      weeks, will assess acceptability, safety, self-efficacy, and BMI. Recruitment will also be&#xD;
      assessed (% eligible patients who consent). In order to understand real-world feasibility of&#xD;
      this intervention, the clinic staff will work with patients to connect the scales to Epic.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Obesity is a major public health issue because of its high prevalence and many health&#xD;
      consequences. Obesity is driven by a dysregulation of the body's energy regulatory systems&#xD;
      and is life-shortening. Obesity during the critical adolescent period increases risk of&#xD;
      diabetes, cardiometabolic disease, all-cause mortality, and adulthood obesity. Rates of&#xD;
      obesity-related cancers are increasing in younger populations. In addition to poorer health,&#xD;
      individuals with obesity during adolescence are at risk for lower productivity, income, and&#xD;
      likelihood of employment in adulthood, making obesity treatment and prevention important for&#xD;
      reducing disparities. Despite consensus on the need for multi-component interventions for&#xD;
      obesity, rates continue to climb for adolescents, youth of low-income backgrounds, and youth&#xD;
      of racial/ethnic minority backgrounds. Clinicians cite lack of time and tools to help&#xD;
      patients lose weight as barriers to weight counseling, and thus need practical, effective&#xD;
      interventions they can feasibly disseminate from a busy clinical setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Self-weighing, grounded in behavior change theory, is effective for weight loss in adults.&#xD;
      Self-monitoring is grounded in Social Cognitive Theory (SCT), which describes behavior change&#xD;
      as happening with reciprocal interactions with one's environment, creating external and&#xD;
      internal self-reinforcement. Self-monitoring is one such interaction that improves&#xD;
      self-awareness through proximate self-measurement, and improves self-efficacy, self-control,&#xD;
      and self-reinforcement. Self-weighing (SW) is a form of self-monitoring for weight loss that&#xD;
      is grounded in SCT. Daily SW in adults has been associated with increased exercise and&#xD;
      cognitive restraint, and reduced snacking, television watching, and consumption of sweets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator found no data on patient and parent perspectives on connecting scales to the&#xD;
      EHR for daily weights in adolescents with obesity seeking obesity treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      99 patients age 12 to &lt;18 years old with obesity (BMI &gt;/=95th percentile), to be randomized&#xD;

&#xD;
        2. Usual Care plus advice to weigh daily on simple scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Usual Care plus advice to weigh-daily on an EHR-connected scale&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survey data collected at baseline, 2, 4, 6, and 12-weeks, and qualitative interviews at 12&#xD;
      weeks, will assess acceptability, safety, self-efficacy, and BMI. Recruitment will also be&#xD;

    <description>Feasibility will be measured by determining if the clinic staff can successfully connect scales to the EHR and access home weights through the EHR. Staff will record time required to connect the scale, answer questions and trouble-shoot problems that arise with the scale between visits to understand the time burden of this intervention.</description>

    <measure>Feasibility of collecting daily weights.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants who are randomized to the simple scale and the EHR-connected scale will be asked to weigh themselves daily (which we anticipate will be 5-7 days per week). Participants who were randomized to the EHR-connected device will have their adherence measured by looking at the EHR to see how many daily weights were completed. Participants randomized to the simple scale will be self-reporting how many times per week they weighed themselves at home with the simple scale</description>

    <measure>Perceptions of daily weight tracking.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants who are randomized to perform daily weighing on a simple scale and on an EHR-connected scale will be asked about their perceptions of having to perform this task on a daily basis via a questionnaire. The questionnaire will be a Likert scale from 0 (not helpful, not motivated, not interesting, not satisfying) to 8 (extremely helpful, extremely motivated, extremely interesting, extremely satisfying).</description>
