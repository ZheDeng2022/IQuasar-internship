  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to European and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines, the&#xD;
      recommended treatment for uncomplicated early syphilis in adults (i.e. primary, secondary and&#xD;
      early latent) is a single intramuscular injection of 2.4 million units of benzathine&#xD;
      benzylpenicillin G (BPG). Recent reviews have also recommended BPG as the first-line&#xD;
      treatment of early syphilis, reporting a success rate of more than 90% over a large panel of&#xD;
      studies. This form of the drug provides weeks of treponemicidal levels of penicillin in the&#xD;
      blood, but does not efficiently cross the blood-brain barrier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, despite the use of BPG for almost 70 years and its status as the gold standard&#xD;
      treatment for early syphilis, the need to administer this antibiotic parenterally has led to&#xD;
      the use of second-line oral antibiotics, including firstgeneration macrolides, and then&#xD;
      second-generation macrolides, such as azithromycin. Several African studies have shown 1 g&#xD;
      azithromycin bid treatment for one day to be effective against early syphilis, but most&#xD;
      authors agree that azithromycin should not generally be used as resistance to this macrolide&#xD;
      is highly prevalent in Western countries. Moreover, a recent study by our group showed that&#xD;
      more than 80% of the treponemal strains isolated in France harbor the mutation conferring&#xD;
      resistance to azithromycin. The use of this alternative would, therefore, be highly unlikely&#xD;
      to be effective in France. Tetracycline antibiotics have also been proposed as an alternative&#xD;
      in patients with a contraindication for BPG or other forms of penicillin. Doxycycline, at a&#xD;
      dose of 100 mg orally twice daily for 14 days, has been endorsed as a preferred alternative&#xD;
      treatment, but few data are available concerning its efficacy. This issue is crucial, for two&#xD;
      main reasons: there has been a recrudescence of early syphilis in most western countries over&#xD;
      the last 20 years, increasing the need for BPG, and two periods of BPG shortage were&#xD;
      experienced in 2013 and 2017, leading to the use of alternative treatments due to the&#xD;
      temporary unavailability of BPG or its limitation to cases in which no other treatment was&#xD;
      possible. Data for the manufacturing and distribution of antibiotics are not publicly&#xD;
      available, but reports of limited availability, shortages, and price increases for old&#xD;
      antibiotics suggest that the current system is too fragile to provide what should be a given&#xD;
      in modern medicine: access to effective treatment for common and potentially severe bacterial&#xD;
      infections. The recurrence of BPG shortages over the last five years has created an urgent&#xD;
      need to demonstrate that doxycycline is safe, or at least as safe as BPG, for treating early&#xD;
      syphilis. The investigators hypothesize that the recommended doxycycline regimen is not&#xD;
      inferior to BPG and plan to test this hypothesis in a randomized clinical trial.&#xD;

    <description>Assessed on the basis of a four-fold decrease in titer in the non-treponemal assay (VDRL or RPR) at month 6 (commonly used to define cure in real-life settings) or a subsequent negative result in the non-treponemal test if the original test gave a results of 1/2 at inclusion.</description>
