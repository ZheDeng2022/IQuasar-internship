  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized trial to assess the efficacy of reminder mechanisms on colorectal cancer&#xD;
      (CRC) screening uptake among a cohort of patients who were previously mailed a multitarget&#xD;
      stool DNA (mt-sDNA) test and did not complete the screening. Patients will be identified as&#xD;
      being due for CRC screening and will be mailed a mt-sDNA kit to their home. Patients who do&#xD;
      not complete screening with mt-sDNA within 30 days will be identified and randomized into one&#xD;
      of three study arms to receive reminders to complete the mt-sDNA screening. The primary&#xD;
      outcome is the rate of completion of screening for colorectal cancer with mt-sDNA test.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related death in the United&#xD;
      States, and screening has been shown to reduce mortality from CRC. Screening is underutilized&#xD;
      in the United States, particularly in some communities such as Blacks/African Americans,&#xD;
      American Indians/Alaskan Natives, and rural populations, contributing to disparities in&#xD;
      mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For CRC screening, mt-sDNA testing is one of several tests that are recommended by the United&#xD;
      States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). As part of a quality improvement program at&#xD;
      our institution, those who are due for CRC screening are identified using a validated&#xD;
      electronic algorithm and a kit is mailed directly to each patient. Our intervention is&#xD;
      initiated on non-respondents to the mailed mt-sDNA outreach by testing the use of a&#xD;
      technology-enabled reminder system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty days after being mailed a mt-sDNA kit, patients who have not completed the screening&#xD;
      will be randomized to receive a reminder to complete the mt-sDNA screening by one of three&#xD;
      mechanisms (time 0):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Automated reminder using the EHR patient portal messaging system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Automated reminder using a customized interactive voice response (IVR) system&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Personalized reminder phone calls from the clinical team&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will allow for an empirical test of processes that can be employed to improve delivery&#xD;
      of CRC screening and reduce preventable deaths in populations that are underserved with&#xD;
      evidence-based interventions.&#xD;
