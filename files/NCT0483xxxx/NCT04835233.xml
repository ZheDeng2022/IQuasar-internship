  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In hypertensive mothers, it is common in clinical practice to substitute methyldopa for&#xD;
      another medication, such as captopril, immediately after delivery, which may, as a&#xD;
      consequence, cause a rebound effect or an initial lack of blood pressure control until the&#xD;
      new medication had a more complete action. Thus, the treatment of hypertension in the&#xD;
      puerperium is generally guided by expert opinion and recommendations for guidelines, based on&#xD;
      non-robust evidence. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the control of blood pressure in postpartum women&#xD;
      with hypertensive syndromes during pregnancy with the maintenance of the continued use of&#xD;
      previously used methyldopa compared to switching from antihypertensive regimen to the use of&#xD;
      captopril. METHOD: Randomized, double-blind, drug controlled clinical trial. EXPECTED RESULT:&#xD;
      better pressure control with the continued use of methyldopa.&#xD;
