  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, observational, multicenter PMCF investigation designed to confirm&#xD;
      clinical performance and safety of ChloraSolv when exposed to larger population of clinical&#xD;
      users. Approximately 65 subjects will be enrolled (calculated dropout range 20%) from at&#xD;
      least 6-12 sites in Sweden. Subjects presented with chronic leg ulcers and chronic diabetic&#xD;
      foot ulcers in need of debridement will be enrolled and receive application of ChloraSolv per&#xD;
      clinical routine at treating site and in accordance with the ChloraSolv Instruction for Use&#xD;
      for up to 24 weeks. Subjects will attend a baseline visit to assess eligibility and collect&#xD;
      demographic and baseline data and initiate treatment. There will be two follow up visits in&#xD;
      the investigation. The first follow up visit will take place at End of Treatment, as based on&#xD;
      investigator judgement and clinical routine at the treating site, maximum 24 weeks post&#xD;
      baseline per the IFU. After End of Treatment, subjects will continue in the investigation&#xD;
      with wound management per clinical routine at the treating sites for 6 weeks. At 6 weeks post&#xD;
      End of Treatment, subjects will attend a Follow-up visit to assess safety, wound status and&#xD;
      relative change in wound size. Besides confirmation of the clinical performance and safety&#xD;
      when used in a larger population the investigation also includes analysis of treatment period&#xD;
      duration. Additionally, health economy parameters will be analyzed. The investigation will be&#xD;
      monitored to confirm the already known precautions as well as identify new precautions and&#xD;
      possible contraindications for the use of the device. Photography of the wound pre and post&#xD;
      debridement will be performed to confirm wound size and amount of devitalized tissue in the&#xD;
      wound.&#xD;
