    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted in 2 parts. Part A will investigate the potential effect of&#xD;
      PF-06865571 on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of PF-06882961 in healthy adult participants. Part B&#xD;
      will evaluate the effect of PF-06882961 on the PK of PF-06865571, as well as the effect of&#xD;
      PF-06865571 on the PK of PF-06882961 in overweight adults or adults with obesity who are&#xD;
      otherwise healthy.&#xD;

&#xD;
         21. Part B only: A Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) score ≥15 obtained at Screening or&#xD;
             Day -1.&#xD;
&#xD;
         22. Part B only: Response of &quot;yes&quot; to question 4 or 5, or on any behavioral question on&#xD;
             the C-SSRS at Screening or Day -1.&#xD;

             5 minutes of supine rest. If BP is ≥140 mm Hg (systolic) or ≥90 mm Hg (diastolic), the&#xD;
             BP should be repeated 2 more times and the average of the 3 BP values should be used&#xD;
             to determine the participant's eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
         25. Screening 12-lead ECG that demonstrates clinically relevant abnormalities that may&#xD;
             affect participant safety or interpretation of study results (eg, baseline QTc&#xD;
             interval &gt;450 msec, complete LBBB, signs of an acute or indeterminate-age myocardial&#xD;
             infarction, ST-T interval changes suggestive of myocardial ischemia, second- or&#xD;
             third-degree AV block, or serious bradyarrhythmias or tachyarrhythmias). If the&#xD;
             baseline uncorrected QT interval is &gt;450 msec, this interval should be rate-corrected&#xD;
             using the Fridericia method and the resulting QTcF should be used for decision making&#xD;
             and reporting. If QTc exceeds 450 msec, or QRS exceeds 120 msec, the ECG should be&#xD;
             repeated 2 more times and the average of the 3 QTc or QRS values should be used to&#xD;
             determine the participant's eligibility. Computer-interpreted ECGs should be overread&#xD;
             by a physician experienced in reading ECGs before excluding participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
         26. A positive COVID-19 test at or after screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
         27. Participants with ANY of the following abnormalities in clinical laboratory tests at&#xD;
             screening, as assessed by the study-specific laboratory and confirmed by a single&#xD;
             repeat test, if deemed necessary: HbA1c ≥6.5%. AST or ALT &gt; ULN. Total bilirubin level&#xD;
             &gt; ULN; participants with a history of Gilbert's syndrome may have direct bilirubin&#xD;
             measured and are eligible for this study provided the direct bilirubin level is ≤ ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
             TSH &gt; ULN or &lt; LLN. Serum calcitonin &gt; ULN. Amylase or lipase &gt; ULN. Fasting blood&#xD;
             glucose ≥126 mg/dL. Fasting triglycerides &gt;200 mg/dL. INR &gt; ULN. PLT &lt; LLN. eGFR &lt;80&#xD;
             mL/min/1.73 m2 as calculated by the CKD-EPI equation. Positive testing for HIV,&#xD;
             HepBsAg, or HCVAb. Study participants positive for HCVAb are to be excluded unless&#xD;
             known to have been treated with a known curative therapy and negative for HCV RNA.&#xD;
             Hepatitis B vaccination is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
         28. Participation in a formal weight reduction program (eg, Weight Watchers) within 90&#xD;
             days prior to Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
         29. History of alcohol abuse or binge drinking and/or any other illicit drug use or&#xD;
             dependence within 6 months of Screening. Binge drinking is defined as a pattern of 5&#xD;
             (male) and 4 (female) or more alcoholic drinks in about 2 hours. As a general rule,&#xD;
             alcohol intake should not exceed 14 units per week (1 unit = 8 ounces (240 mL) beer, 1&#xD;
             ounce (30 mL) of 40% spirit or 3 ounces (90 mL) of wine).&#xD;
&#xD;
         30. Current use of tobacco or nicotine containing products in excess of the equivalent of&#xD;
             5 cigarettes per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
         31. Known or suspected illicit drug use.&#xD;
&#xD;
         32. Blood donation (excluding plasma donations) of approximately 1 pint (500 mL) or more&#xD;

             used for IV blood draw.&#xD;
&#xD;
         34. Unwilling or unable to comply with the criteria in the Lifestyle Considerations&#xD;
             section of this protocol.&#xD;
