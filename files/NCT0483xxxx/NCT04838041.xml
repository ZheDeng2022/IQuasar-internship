  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm phase II study that will enroll a minimum of 41 subjects with a maximum&#xD;
      of 51. All patients will have a confirmed diagnosis of chronic phase chronic myeloid Leukemia&#xD;
      and must have previously attempted to discontinue imatinib. All patients must be restarted on&#xD;
      imatinib at the time of relapse in order to be eligible for this trial.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial will use a combination of asciminib 40 mg by mouth (PO) twice daily (BID) plus&#xD;
      imatinib (maximum dose of 400 mg PO once daily) in the combination treatment phase. The&#xD;
      BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that will be used for this trial is imatinib. All&#xD;
      eligible patients will begin asciminib in combination with imatinib on cycle 1 day 1 of the&#xD;
      combination phase. They will continue combination therapy for a total of 12 cycles (minimum&#xD;
      of 12 months). Each cycle will be ~28 days. At the end of 12 cycles asciminib will be&#xD;
      discontinued and any patient who has met the criteria for the treatment-free remission (TFR)&#xD;
      screening phase will enter into the TFR phase. Once in the TFR phase, patients will&#xD;
      discontinue their imatinib and be monitored off treatment. The primary endpoint of this study&#xD;
      is the 12-month &quot;second&quot; TFR rate after completion of 12 cycles of combination therapy.&#xD;
      Patients will remain in the TFR phase of the study for up to three years and will have&#xD;
      central polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing during the first two years. Therefore, the&#xD;
      total duration of the subject participation trial will be approximately five years (one year&#xD;
      on combination treatment phase plus three years in the TFR phase plus one year of long-term&#xD;
      follow-up post TFR or early discontinuation.&#xD;

             b3a2 (e14a2) or b2a2 (e13a2) is not required for study eligibility.&#xD;

                  had &gt;4 PCR tests performed during the two years leading up to their initial TKI&#xD;
                  discontinuation, any value between 0.01 and 0.05% IS is considered a stable&#xD;
