  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BACKGROUND: Idiopathic scoliosis has been identified as a common spinal malalignment that&#xD;
      negatively impacts the respiratory system and physical conditioning in adolescents.&#xD;
      Hippotherapy is an equestrian intervention that optimizes physical performance and mobility&#xD;
      in a bunch of contexts; however, its influence on pulmonary function remains unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM: This research aimed to analyze the impact of ten weeks of hippotherapy combined with&#xD;
      Schroth exercises on ventilatory function and aerobic capacity in AIS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN: Randomized Controlled Trial SETTING: Outpatients attend a single center that includes&#xD;
      a rehabilitation room and recreational riding center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POPULATION: Forty-five patients were arbitrarily recruited to the experimental (N= 22) and&#xD;
      control group (N=23).&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS: Patients in the experimental group received 30 minutes of walking and sitting trot&#xD;
      training, 15 sessions split into 2 phases over ten weeks. The two groups attended a 60-minute&#xD;
      session of Schroth's intervention, 3 times/ week for 10 weeks. Two-way ANOVA for&#xD;
      between-group comparisons and independent t-test for within-group comparisons were used in&#xD;
      the statistical analysis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 45 patients (13 males and 32 females) participated in the current study. The&#xD;
      participants were assigned to one of two groups in a random manner: an experimental group who&#xD;
      received hippotherapy combined with Schroth Exercise and the control group who received only&#xD;
      schorth exercise. (FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC, MVV, and 6MWT) were measured before and after 10&#xD;
      weeks intervention&#xD;
