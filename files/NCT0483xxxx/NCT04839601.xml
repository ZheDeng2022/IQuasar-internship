  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      NeuroPace is sponsoring the RESPONSE Study with the RNS System in individuals age 12 through&#xD;
      17 with partial (focal) onset seizures who have undergone diagnostic testing that localized&#xD;
      no more than 2 epileptogenic foci, are refractory to two or more antiepileptic medications,&#xD;
      and currently have frequent and disabling seizures. For the purposes of this study, disabling&#xD;
      seizures are defined as motor partial seizures, complex partial seizures, and/or secondarily&#xD;
      generalized seizures. The RNS System is currently approved by the FDA for use in patients 18&#xD;
      years and older with hard-to-treat partial-onset seizures. The same device will be used in&#xD;
      the RESPONSE Study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a prospective open label single arm pivotal study and participants will be&#xD;
      followed for 2 years after placement of the RNS System. The study will enroll a maximum of&#xD;
      200 subjects within the United States to ensure that at least 150 subjects are implanted with&#xD;
      the RNS System.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design includes one interim analysis which will occur after the 75th implanted&#xD;
      patient reaches 12 months post-implant. If the study achieves its primary safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness endpoint goals at the interim analysis, the study will be considered successful&#xD;
      and enrollment will be stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the interim analysis does not achieve the primary safety and effectiveness endpoint goals,&#xD;
      the study will continue enrolling up to the maximum of 200 patients. A final analysis will be&#xD;
      conducted after the 150th implanted patient reaches 12 months post-implant.&#xD;

    <description>The RNS System provides closed loop responsive brain stimulation. The Neurostimulator monitors the electrical activity of the brain to detect abnormal activity that could lead to a seizure. If abnormal activity is detected, the neurostimulator delivers electrical stimulation to the brain through the leads to help prevent the seizure before it occurs.</description>
