      The research was designed in a randomized controlled quasi-experimental type in order to&#xD;
      reveal the effect of &quot;Self-Care Behaviors Development Program for Urinary Tract Infections&quot;&#xD;
      prepared according to Orem's Self Care Model on the behavioral change in pregnant women.&#xD;

      Study Population and Sample The universe of the study consists of all women who have been&#xD;
      diagnosed with pregnancy who admitted to the pregnant outpatient clinics of hospitals and who&#xD;
      meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Pregnant women were selected by simple random&#xD;
      sampling method and included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      n=(Nt^2 pq)/(d^2 (N-1)+t^2 pq) According to his formula, n = 29.828625 was found at the&#xD;
      significance level of α = 0.05 at 0.05 margin of error.&#xD;
&#xD;
      n = Number of women to be included in the sampling N = the number of participants that make&#xD;
      up the universe of the research (3000) p = Frequency of occurrence (0.02) q = frequency of&#xD;
      occurrence of the event (1-p) t = t table value at the error level detected at a certain&#xD;
      degree of freedom (1.96) d = the desired deviation value (0.05) according to the frequency of&#xD;
      occurrence of the event When the urinary system infection is seen as 2% in pregnant women&#xD;
      (Ayhan et al.2008) and the number of live births of the hospital in one year is taken as 3000&#xD;
      reference (Hospital archive) α = 0.05 at the significance level of 0.05 The number of&#xD;
      pregnant women to be sampled in the margin of error is 30 people. It is planned to work with&#xD;
      a total of 60 participants, 30 for the experimental group and 30 for the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization was applied to determine the experimental and control groups. Data Collection&#xD;
      Tools Before determining the data collection tools, the literature about the research subject&#xD;
      was searched. Tools were determined in accordance with the information obtained from the&#xD;
      literature. At the same time, a Self-Care Behaviors Development Program was created, and it&#xD;
      was decided to implement the program with the pregnant women in the experimental group by&#xD;
      face-to-face meeting and then by phone call. Two forms and an inventory were used to collect&#xD;
      data in the study. Data collection tools used in research;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnant Information Form&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnant Evaluation Form&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Genital Hygiene Behaviors Inventory&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy Education Brochure Data Collection The pregnant women who accepted to&#xD;
           participate in the study were informed about the purpose and importance of the research,&#xD;
           data collection tools and methods, and the flow of the study. While a brochure was given&#xD;
           to the pregnant women in the control group (after the end of the study) in the&#xD;
           randomization table, the pregnant women in the experimental group were informed that&#xD;
           they were included in a training and counseling program and that they would be&#xD;
           interviewed again by phone. Each pregnant participating in the study was also informed&#xD;
           that she could quit the study at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data collection of the research took place in 4 stages. Preparation phase Before starting&#xD;
      the study, the written permissions of the study (the permission of the ethics committee, the&#xD;
      permission of the institution where the study will be conducted and the use of the Genital&#xD;
      Hygiene Behavior Inventory used in the study were obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First stage Determination of groups and randomization: It was planned to have an experimental&#xD;
      and a control group according to the type of study. Determination of the patients included in&#xD;
      the experimental and control groups was made using the randomization program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obtaining Informed Volunteer Consent: After obtaining the necessary permissions for the&#xD;
      study, the researcher gave written and verbal expressions about the study in a language they&#xD;
      understand to the pregnant women who met the inclusion criteria of the study. After the&#xD;
      written consent form was signed by the pregnant women who accepted to participate in the&#xD;
      study, the study was carried out by the researcher using a face-to-face interview technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second stage After all the necessary permissions and preparations for the study were made,&#xD;
      the data collection tools of the study (Pregnant Information Form, Genital Hygiene Behavior&#xD;
      Inventory) were filled in in accordance with the information obtained from the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the information obtained, the &quot;Self-Care Behaviors Development Program for Urinary&#xD;
      Tract Infections&quot; prepared for the pregnant women in the experimental group was applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnancy Follow-up Form and Genital Hygiene Behavior Inventory were applied to the pregnant&#xD;
      women in the experimental group 2 weeks after the end of the program, in order to evaluate&#xD;
      the effectiveness of the training by the researcher using the telephone interview technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Third stage All information obtained by the researcher and from the patient records were&#xD;
      recorded in the Pregnant Information Form, Pregnancy Evaluation Form and Genital Hygiene&#xD;
      Behavior Inventory. The recorded data were transferred to the computer environment by the&#xD;
      researcher, and the data were evaluated and statistically analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Evaluation The evaluation and statistical analysis of the data were performed in&#xD;
      computer environment using the Statistical Pocket Program Statistical Package for the Social&#xD;
      Sciences (statistics program for social sciences = SPSS 22.0). In the first stage,&#xD;
      percentages and averages were calculated in the calculation of the distribution of the data&#xD;
      of the study. In the second stage, when the numerical data met the normal distribution&#xD;
      criteria, statistical analysis was performed using an independent sample t test, considering&#xD;
      the distribution of normality. Numerical data that did not show normal distribution were&#xD;
      evaluated using the Mann Whitney U test. Variables specified in frequency will be analyzed by&#xD;
      Chi-square test. P &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.&#xD;
