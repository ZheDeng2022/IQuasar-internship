      The purpose of this study is to estimate the effects of diet and exercise interventions on&#xD;
      body weight, cardiovascular metabolic markers, executive function, and intestinal flora among&#xD;
      undergraduate students, as well as the underlying mechanisms.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In recent decades, unhealthy dietary patterns and insufficiency of physical activity have&#xD;
      brought negative effects on human health, such as rapid increasing incidence of obesity,&#xD;
      metabolic cardiovascular diseases, and mental disorders. The first line of prevention and&#xD;
      therapy for these diseases is proper diet and lifestyle interventions. A series of studies&#xD;
      conducted in vivo and vitro have shown that high-fiber diets and time-restricted eating&#xD;
      present benefits in weight loss, reducing cardiovascular disease risk, and improving&#xD;
      cognitive function. While, there is also a randomized controlled trial do not observe the&#xD;
      effects of time-restricted eating on weight loss and decrease of metabolic risks. Meanwhile,&#xD;
      few studies have examined the effects of high-fiber diets or time-restricted eating on&#xD;
      executive function. Additionally, previous studies on high-fiber diets and time-restricted&#xD;
      eating focused on middle-aged or elderly populations with some features of metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome, while the effects on healthy young populations are unclear. More importantly, there&#xD;
      are a small amount of studies exploring the combined effects of time-restricted eating and&#xD;
      physical activity on metabolism and cognitive function. Therefore, our study is to estimate&#xD;
      the effects of diet (high-fiber diets and time-restricted eating) and exercise&#xD;
      (rope-skipping) interventions on body weight, cardiovascular metabolic markers, executive&#xD;
      function, and intestinal flora among undergraduate students, as well as the underlying&#xD;
      mechanisms.&#xD;

Participants will be instructed to take food from 7:30 AM until 5:30 PM and completely abstain from caloric intake for the remainder of the day (14 hours fast:10 hours eat). Only noncaloric beverages were permitted outside of the eating widow.&#xD;
According to the dietary recommendation proposed by Chinese Government and the existing dishes in the canteen , participants are instructed to eat following a high-diet recipe weekly from Monday to Friday which includes whole grain wheat rice, vegetables, fruits, and other foods rich in dietary fiber .</description>
