             randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Moderate to severe psoriasis as defined at Baseline/ randomization by:&#xD;
&#xD;
             PASI score of 12 or greater, and sPGA score of 3 or greater (based on a static scale&#xD;
             of 0 - 5), and Body Surface Area (BSA) affected by plaque psoriasis of 10% or greater.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject has moderate to severe chronic plaque-type psoriasis that is inadequately&#xD;
             controlled by topical treatment and/or phototherapy and/or previous systemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Body Mass Index (BMI) is 18 kg/m2 or above at screening&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Forms of psoriasis other than chronic plaque-type (e.g., pustular, erythrodermic and&#xD;
             guttate psoriasis) at Screening or Baseline/randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Drug-induced psoriasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Had a clinically significant flare of psoriasis during the 12 weeks prior to baseline&#xD;
             (Week 0).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Presence of other skin conditions (e.g. skin infections, seborrheic dermatitis) that&#xD;
             in the judgement of the Investigator could interfere with assessment of psoriasis.&#xD;

             diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. At screening, history or symptoms of malignancy of any organ system, treated or&#xD;
             untreated, within the past 5 years, regardless of whether there is evidence of local&#xD;
             recurrence or metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. History of congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] functional&#xD;
             classification ≥III), cerebro-cardiovascular events, or serious bleeding events at&#xD;
             screening and / or randomization that in the judgement of the Investigator prevents&#xD;
             the subject from participating in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Active systemic infections (other than common cold) during the 4 weeks before&#xD;
             randomization (e.g., hepatitis), or serious infections requiring hospitalization&#xD;
             and/or intravenous injection of antibiotic treatment within eight weeks prior&#xD;
             torandomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. History of depression and/or suicidal ideation or any suicidal behavior based on an&#xD;
             assessment with the Columbina Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) at screening and&#xD;
             baseline (Posner K et al, 2011), The subjects will be exluded if any answer to&#xD;
             question is &quot;yes&quot; in the questionnaire orare clinically judged by the investigator to&#xD;
             be at risk for suicide.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. All subjects will be tested for tuberculosis status using IGRA and X-ray test.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Have evidence of positive test for hepatitis B, hepatitis C antibody, or human&#xD;
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Have a known allergy or hypersensitivity to any biologic therapy at screening that&#xD;
             would pose an unacceptable risk to the subject if participating in this study.&#xD;
