  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the Person-First - Please (PFP)&#xD;
      intervention in supporting nurse's competence and collective competence of Person-Centred&#xD;
      Care (PCC) in older people Long-Term Care (LTC). The goal is to promote PCC culture in older&#xD;
      people LTC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research question 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      What is the effectiveness of the PFP intervention on the PCC collective competency of nurses&#xD;
      in older people LTC?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis for research question 1 are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Nurses in intervention group will have higher level of competence of PCC than control.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Nurse in intervention group will have higher level of collective competence of PCC than&#xD;
           control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research question 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      How PCC climate has been maintained in older people LTC from the point of view of the nurses,&#xD;
      next of kin and older people?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis for research question 2 are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. PCC climate will be better in intervention group than control from point of view of the&#xD;
           nurses, next of kin and older people.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The higher competence of nurses the higher level of PCC climate from point of view of&#xD;
           the next of kin and older people.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The higher collective competence of the nurses the higher level of the PCC climate from&#xD;
           point of view of the next of kin and older people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research question 3:&#xD;
&#xD;
      What is the fidelity /feasibility of the PFP?&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study takes place in older people long-term care on two cities in western part of&#xD;
      Finland. The long-term care units are similar as stuff structure, nurse/resident ration,&#xD;
      working ideology and quality management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research design is cluster randomised controlled trial with pre- and post- test&#xD;
      measurements in the intervention and control groups. The intervention group will follow the&#xD;
      protocol and the control group participants will follow the usually care. Data are being&#xD;
      collected at baseline, immediately after 10 weeks intervention and at follow-up 6 weeks after&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuing education named &quot;Person First - Please&quot; (PFP) based on Person-Centered Care (PCC)&#xD;
      Practice Framework and Theory of Collective Competence and it consist of four modules:&#xD;
      Information, Person, Autonomy and Dignity. Information module will take one hour in the first&#xD;
      intervention week, and it will include information about the study; informed consent; short&#xD;
      clarification about concept PCC and prerequisites for PCC. Tree other modules takes 4 hours&#xD;
      contact with researcher in every three weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power analyses for the sample size showed that for 0.8 effect size, power of 0.8 and&#xD;
      statistical significance of 0.05 with three main hypotheses, for intervention group n=64 and&#xD;
      for control group n=128. ICC of 0.1 was used based on previous sample of the primary outcome&#xD;
      measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomization based on cluster sampling. Two cities will be constituting the clusters in&#xD;
      western part of Finland. From these cities will be selected first all public long-term care&#xD;
      units for the older people. To avoid contamination, one of the cities will be selected to&#xD;
      participate in the intervention and the other in the control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the study consist of nurses (Registered Nurses, Licensed Practice Nurses,&#xD;
      Caregiver Assistants) who work in older people LTC and older people from the same units&#xD;
      participate alone or with their next of kin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nurses background questions are age, education, working experience. Older people and next of&#xD;
      kin background questions are age, length of the living in LTC, relationship, number of visits&#xD;
      per week in LTC. The effectiveness of an intervention is measured by validated measurements&#xD;
      that have been properly licensed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be analysed by latest version of the Software Platform for Statistical Analysis&#xD;
      (SPSS). Descriptive statistic will be calculated for the numerical and categorical data. The&#xD;
      normal distribution of the data and 95% confidence intervals will be calculated for the&#xD;
      numerical and categorical data. Intervention and control group will be statistically&#xD;
      compared, and differences will be measured at each time point. At the baseline will be ensure&#xD;
      the similarity of intervention and control group for background variables. Cross-tabulations&#xD;
      will be done for categorical and numerical variables. The sum variable of the measurements&#xD;
      during the three different measurement time will be analysed using hierarchical linear mixed&#xD;
      models will compare the changes over time between the groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will be informed before about the purpose of the study, issues related to&#xD;
      research ethics, reporting of the findings and they will sign informed consent. Since the&#xD;
      study involves research participants who are vulnerable due to cognitive impairment,&#xD;
      researcher have clear protocol and special attention will be paid to ethical issues during&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;

    <description>The competence data will be collected by the Patient-centred Care Competency (PCC) scale as primary outcome. The PCC scale consists of 17 items with 5-point Likert scale (1 = minimal, 2 = below average, 3 = average, 4 = good, 5 = excellent), divided subscales: respecting patients' perspectives, promoting patient involvement in care processes, providing for patient comfort, and advocating for patients.</description>

    <description>There is not available any questionnaire to measurement the collective competence. Therefore it will be measured by using the Patient-centred Care Competency (PCC) scales sum variables, and changes in the data of Person-centred questionnaire (PCQ-p and PCQ-S) scales.</description>

    <description>The PCC climate data will be collected by Person-centred questionnaire (PCQ-S) staff version and (PCQ-P) patient version (6- point Likert scale: 0 = No, I disagree completely; 1 = No, I disagree; 2 = No, I partly disagree, 3 = Yes, I partly agree; 4 = Yes, I agree; 5 = Yes, I agree completely). Scales are divided subscales: hospitality, safety and everydayness. Data will be collect from nurses, older people and their next of kin.</description>

    <description>A feasibility tool has been developed for this intervention. Data will be collected from the nurses in end of the every PFP-modules, excluded information module.&#xD;
Tool consist of the subscales: content of the PFP; evaluation about the pedagogical methods; utilization of the PFP; evaluation of the PFP dosage; evaluation of the trainer. There is 5-point Likert scale: 1 = disagree; 2 = partly disagree; 3 = no disagree/no agree; 4 = agree; 5 = agree completely.</description>
