  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The implications of obesity, especially visceral fat, in health are well known. It would be&#xD;
      desirable to control obesity by safe and effective treatment modalities. Aim: To assess the&#xD;
      effectiveness of Auricular Acupuncture (AA) on body weight loss in a Portuguese sample.&#xD;

      Methods: After a pre-study, a prospective experimental randomized, controlled and&#xD;
      single-blinded study was conducted. The sample included 31 adult women with ages ranging from&#xD;
      20 to 51 years old. The groups had a frequency of physical activity ≥ 2 and ≤ 4 times per&#xD;
      week. Individuals with BMI ≤ 24.9 Kg/m2 and pregnant women excluded from the study. All&#xD;
      participants were then randomized into one of three groups: group 1 was treated with Vaccaria&#xD;
      seeds plus diet therapy, group 2 with ASP needles plus diet therapy and finally, group 3&#xD;
      received only diet therapy. A licensed nutritionist prescribed the hypocaloric diet plan.&#xD;
      Baseline evaluation included anthropometric measures collected according to standardized&#xD;
      procedures. They received two treatments per week for a total of 6 weeks. After one month of&#xD;
      follow-up, all the anthropometric measures were reevaluated. Main Parameters: Weight/body&#xD;
      composition by bioelectrical impedance analysis. Secondary parameters: Waist to height ratio&#xD;
      (WHtR), weight and Body Mass Index (BMI).&#xD;

    <description>Vaccaria seeds at the exterior side of the ear area, standard points were selected according to clinical experience in traditional Chinese medicine: Shenmen (TF4), Stomach (CO4), Hunger, Mouth (CO1), Point Zero HX1) and Sanjiao (CO17). Mustard seeds (Vaccaria ear seeds, Beijing Zhongyan Taihe Medicine, Beijing, China) were used, plus diet therapy prescribed by a licensed nutritionist.</description>

    <description>Auriculotherapy is a technique derived from traditional acupuncture developed into a distinct treatment system of its own. It is based on either, the introduction of needles (auricular acupuncture), or pressure with Vaccaria seeds (acupressure). Those forms of auriculotherapy are applied on a set of anatomical maps at a specific point in the auricular region.</description>
