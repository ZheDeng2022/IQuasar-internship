  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will focus on speaking to women who have been diagnosed with one of the five main&#xD;
      gynaecological cancers: ovarian, endometrial (womb), cervical, vulval and vaginal. Too many&#xD;
      women are dying from gynaecological cancer in the UK. There are many reasons for this, but&#xD;
      the study investigators think that embarrassment might be one of the reasons. It can be&#xD;
      embarrassing to talk about gynaecological cancers or the symptoms that they cause. This might&#xD;
      lead some women to delay going to their doctor when they have symptoms. This study will speak&#xD;
      with women who have been diagnosed with a gynaecological cancer to ask them what they did&#xD;
      before they were diagnosed; when did they realise something was wrong; what made them go to&#xD;
      their doctor; did having gynaecological symptoms make them think differently about going to&#xD;
      the doctor? This information will be used to find ways of making it as easy as possible for&#xD;
      women to go to their doctors as early as possible. This will hopefully see fewer women dying&#xD;
      from these cancers.&#xD;

      The study will explore the research questions using qualitative semi-structured interviews&#xD;
      with women diagnosed with gynaecological cancer. A study information sheet, reply slip and a&#xD;
      reply-paid envelope will be sent to eligible patients by their secondary care clinician, with&#xD;
      reminders sent after two weeks. Recruitment and interviewing will take place until data&#xD;
      saturation occurs (three interviews with no new shared beliefs) on the main themes.&#xD;
      Interviews will take place at a mutually convenient time and place, ideally face to face but&#xD;
      could be conducted over the telephone if preferred by the interviewee or if social distancing&#xD;
      measures are still in place due to Covid-19. Further verbal and written information regarding&#xD;
      the study will be provided prior to interview commencement and participants will be given the&#xD;
      opportunity to ask questions. Those agreeing to take part in a face to face interview will&#xD;
      sign a consent form in duplicate (one for the participant and one copy for the research&#xD;
      team). Those participating in a telephone interview will be read each point of the consent&#xD;
      form and asked to agree to each one. This will be recorded, transcribed and used as evidence&#xD;
      of consent. Interviews will be conducted flexibly allowing for shorter interviews where&#xD;
      necessary and participants will be reminded that the interviews can be terminated at any&#xD;
      time. The participant can withdraw from the study at any time: data already collected with&#xD;
      consent will be retained and used in the study. No further data will be collected, or any&#xD;
      other research procedures carried out on or in relation to the participant. All interviews&#xD;
      will be digitally audio recorded and transcribed verbatim by the CI or NHSG approved&#xD;
      transcription service. The data will be stored and managed using NVivo software. Interviews&#xD;
      will follow a semi-structured topic guide based on the COM-B behaviour change model concepts&#xD;
      of capability, opportunity and motivation. Changes can be made to the topic guide as&#xD;
      interviews are conducted. Data familiarisation will be by reading and rereading transcripts&#xD;
      and by listening to the recorded interviews. Data will be analysed using iterative deductive&#xD;
      and inductive methods combining Framework analysis and thematic analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A contact will be provided for patients should they become distressed because of contact by&#xD;
      or participation in the study. Although all data collected will stored and analysed with the&#xD;
      strictest of confidence in line with the General Data Protection Regulations (2018), if&#xD;
      details of any improper conduct or poor practice are disclosed the research team may be&#xD;
      obliged to report this. The participant's GP will not be informed. Study participants will&#xD;
      have any travel costs reimbursed.&#xD;
