  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate the use and preliminary impact of an mHealth app for improving sexual&#xD;
      health outcome measures among male couples by assessing whether exposure and use of the app&#xD;
      results in improvements in participants and couples' self-reported sexual health and&#xD;
      prevention behaviors, beliefs, and attitudes. The study will enroll both men of the couple&#xD;
      into a randomized controlled trial. Participants/couples randomized to the intervention will&#xD;
      have access to the app for two months while those assigned to the waitlist group will receive&#xD;
      and have access to the app for one month. Participants will complete surveys at baseline and&#xD;
      at month 2.&#xD;

      The study will evaluate the use and preliminary impact of an mHealth app for improving sexual&#xD;
      health outcome measures among male couples by assessing whether exposure and use of the app&#xD;
      results in improvements in participants and couples' self-reported sexual health and&#xD;
      prevention behaviors, beliefs, and attitudes. The study will enroll both partners of the 42&#xD;
      male couples into a 2-month randomized controlled trial with a waitlist control condition of&#xD;
      one month. Couples will be assigned to either the immediate intervention group (&quot;intervention&#xD;
      arm&quot;) or the waitlist-control group (&quot;waitlist-control arm&quot;). All participants will take an&#xD;
      assessment survey at baseline, and the intervention group will be oriented on the&#xD;
      installation and use of the app upon randomization to that group. The waitlist-control group&#xD;
      will follow the same procedures one month later. Participants/couples randomized to the&#xD;
      intervention arm will have access to the intervention app for two months (ie, day 1-60) while&#xD;
      those assigned to the waitlist-control group will have access to the app for one month (ie,&#xD;
      day 31-60). All participants in the randomized controlled trial will complete a short&#xD;
      follow-up survey at month 2 and a brief exit interview.&#xD;

    <description>From day 31 to day 60 (ie., during month 2) of the trial, participants in the waitlist arm will be granted access and instructed to use the OurPlan program as directed. The OurPlan program includes 4 modules covering topics of communication, HIV/STI prevention, HIV/STI statistics, and stigma / discrimination. Each module contains content, questions, and an activity for the participant and couple to complete. OurPlan also includes a resource locator using GPS-capabilities to allow participants to find sexual health resources, as well as a calendar and reminder system. One goal of OurPlan is to help both partners of the couple create and use a risk-reduction plan of evidence-based prevention strategies over time. Answers provided during the assessments will help determine whether participants/couples created a risk-reduction plan and used evidence-based strategies over time, including changes in their own and partner-related attitudes toward these strategies.</description>
