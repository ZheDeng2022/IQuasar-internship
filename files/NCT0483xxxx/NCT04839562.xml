      A double-blind, placebo controlled study of solriamfetol for adults age 18 to 65 with&#xD;
      diagnosis of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be between 18 and 65 years old, have at least 5 current symptoms of inattentive&#xD;
      or impulsive-hyperactive traits, and childhood onset of ADHD symptoms, defined as two&#xD;
      symptoms of inattentive or of impulsive/hyperactive traits by the age of 12. Subjects will&#xD;
      also have a score of 20 or more on the Adult ADHD Investigator Symptom Report Scale (AISRS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will exclude individuals who are contraindicated by current FDA label&#xD;
      recommendations, which elaborates appropriate use of solriamfetol for individuals with sleep&#xD;
      apnea and narcolepsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a a six week, double blind, dose-optimization study. After giving informed&#xD;
      consent to participate, participants will undergo a comprehensive assessment including a&#xD;
      psychiatric assessment reviewing eligibility.&#xD;
