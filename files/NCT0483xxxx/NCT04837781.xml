    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of vitamin D3 deficiency on the rate of&#xD;
      orthodontic tooth movement in both conventional and accelerated orthodontic. Assessing both&#xD;
      lower anterior teeth alignment and the rate of maxillary canine retraction.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      To evaluate the effect of vitamin D deficiency on the rate of orthodontic tooth movement in&#xD;
      both conventional and accelerated orthodontic, additionally find the effect of vitamin D&#xD;
      deficiency on molar anchorage loss, canine rotation, lower incisor crowding alignment time,&#xD;
      pain experienced by the patient during OTM and rate of orthodontically induce apical root&#xD;
      resorption.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Blinding to treatment allocation was possible only for the investigator and data analyst because the clinicians could know the intervention as osteo-perforation can be obviously seen clearly. Masking the intervention for the participants were not possible because micro-osteoperforation is a surgical procedure. All the trial documents were labeled with the study ID number, which was used for participant identification and data collection without unmasking the allocation group. This allowed the investigator to complete data collection and measurements blindly.</masking_description>

    <description>3D scanned study models were used to measure the amount of crowding in the mandibular anterior teeth using 3Dprogram (DentalCad,Galway,3.0,2021). If Little's irregularity index is less than 1mm and alignment improvement not above 0.5 mm between two successive visits, then treatment is regarded as finished.</description>

    <measure>Root resorption</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The amount of root resorption was measured at the start of treatment and after 12 weeks, the length of the root was recoded at these time intervals. Radiographic films were positioned using a customized sensor holder for the lower anterior teeth with a 7cm film-cone distance using long cone paralleling technique. The radiographs were made at 70kV and 8mA DC with an exposure of 0.25 seconds.</description>

    <measure>pain perception</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluations of pain/discomfort was made in the evening on a daily basis over the first 7 days after bonding using a 10- point visual analog scale (VAS) of 10cm length. The highest pain level experienced should be reported by each patient.&#xD;
The recording sheet was received by all the patients on the day of bonding, it included seven visual analog scales (one for each day) and the patients were given oral instructions on how to finish the VAS by marking the point on the line which supposed to represent the maximum pain that they felt per day, with 0 refers to &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 refers to &quot;intolerable pain&quot;. Patients were reminded daily by a phone call or a text message to mark the recording sheet and to bring it on their next appointment</description>
