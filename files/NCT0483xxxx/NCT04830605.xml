  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Health anxiety by proxy is defined as parents' obsessive worries about their child's health.&#xD;
      It is a newly described phenomenon, where the parent has persistent and distressing fears&#xD;
      that his or her child may suffer from a serious disease that is being overlooked. These&#xD;
      intrusive thoughts may lead to excessive attention directed towards their child's body and a&#xD;
      tendency to interpret natural bodily sensations as unnatural and abnormal. As a consequence,&#xD;
      parents with health anxiety by proxy may repetitively perform bodily inspections of their&#xD;
      child. Besides the stress related to worrying about your child's health, the condition can&#xD;
      also cause frequent and unnecessary medical examinations of the child. As a possible&#xD;
      consequence of this parental behavior, the child may be at risk of developing similar&#xD;
      maladaptive illness behaviors, illness perceptions and illness worries. Currently, the&#xD;
      phenomenon is widely overlooked and no treatment for health anxiety by proxy exists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to test the feasibility and possible effect of an internet-based&#xD;
      treatment program for health anxiety by proxy (iACT-by-proxy) using a single-case&#xD;
      experimental design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design The iACT-by-proxy is being tested in a single-case experimental design with multiple&#xD;
      baselines. In a multiple baseline design the participants have different baseline lengths but&#xD;
      the same intervention and follow-up period. The rationale behind the different baseline&#xD;
      lengths is that it will be evident if target outcome measures change at intervention entry,&#xD;
      but not during baseline. Thus the participants' baseline-period functions as their own&#xD;
      control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will report a significant decrease in selected self-report measures of health&#xD;
           anxiety by proxy answered every other day when comparing the baseline period to the&#xD;
           interven-tion period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient self-report measures of health anxiety by proxy, emotional distress, and illness&#xD;
           perception and catastrophizing when the child has symptoms will have decreased after&#xD;
           intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants Parents assessed with health anxiety by proxy with children under 18years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment Participants are assessed with health anxiety by proxy using the Health Anxiety&#xD;
      by Proxy Scale (HAPYS).Participants self-refer to the project through the webpage&#xD;
      www.helbredsangst.dk. After diagnostic video-interview they are included in the project.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health anxiety by proxy is a newly described phenomenon, where the parent has persistent and&#xD;
      distressing fears that his or her child may suffer from a serious disease that is being&#xD;
      overlooked. These intrusive thoughts may lead to excessive attention directed towards their&#xD;
      child's body and a tendency to interpret natural bodily sensations as abnormal. As a&#xD;
      consequence, parents with health anxiety by proxy may repetitively perform bodily inspections&#xD;
      of their child or have medicial examinations conducted (1, 2). As a possible consequence of&#xD;
      this parental behavior, the child may be at risk of developing similar maladaptive illness&#xD;
      behaviors, illness perceptions and illness worries(3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research on parents suffering from health anxiety has found evidence of health anxiety&#xD;
      symptoms being transmitted from parent to child (4, 5) indicating that the parent's response&#xD;
      to the child's health complaints (6) and how the parent copes with own symptoms may influence&#xD;
      the health attitudes and behaviors of the child(7-10). This risk may be especially high if&#xD;
      the parent suffers from health anxiety by proxy because the child is exposed to a particular&#xD;
      preoccupation with and fear of illness and symptoms. For these reasons health anxiety by&#xD;
      proxy is an important but neglected clinical phenomenon. Therefore, it is important to&#xD;
      develop and test treatment targeting health anxiety by proxy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Internet-based treatment is a relatively new approach that compares favourably with&#xD;
      face-to-face treatment (15, 16). The Research Clinic for Functional Disorders and&#xD;
      Psychosomatics (Research Clinic), Aarhus University Hospital (AUH) has recently developed an&#xD;
      internet-based treatment program (iACT) for health anxiety based on principles from&#xD;
      Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)(17). This treatment has shown promising results (14,&#xD;
      18) and is used as a template for the development of specialised treatment for parents with&#xD;
      health anxiety by proxy. The treatment is called iACT-by proxy and is targeting parents'&#xD;
      maladaptive anxiety-driven behaviour towards their child with focus on exposure therapy in&#xD;
      the context of ACT principles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to test the feasibility and possible effect of the iACT- by proxy&#xD;
      treatment program for health anxiety by proxy using a single-case experimental design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will report a significant decrease in selected self-report measures of health&#xD;
           anxiety by proxy answered every other day when comparing the baseline period to the&#xD;
           interven-tion period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient self-report measures of health anxiety by proxy, emotional distress, and illness&#xD;
           perception and catastrophizing when the child has symptoms will have decreased after&#xD;
           intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for success of feasibility&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The treatment modules will be well received by the patients regarding format, length,&#xD;
           content and contact to the therapist as measured by patient self-report on selected&#xD;
           questions and with semi-structured interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will log in to the modules on a weekly basis and will complete at least 6 out&#xD;
           of 8 modules in the treatment. A module is complete when all text has been read in the&#xD;
           module and corresponding exercises have been performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Self-reported negative effects of participating are low.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants and recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients apply for participation in the project through the webpage www.helbredsangst.dk&#xD;
      using NemID. On the webpage the patient will find information about health anxiety by proxy&#xD;
      and the research project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When logging in the participant is met with written information about participation and a&#xD;
      following statement of consent giving permission to the health professionals in the project&#xD;
      to directly collect health information from the patient record and use questionnaire data for&#xD;
      research purposes in anonymised form. NemID is accepted as a digital signature by the Data&#xD;
      Protection Agency. After the statement of consent, the participant is redirected to a&#xD;
      questionnaire about physical and psychological symptoms, and personal background information.&#xD;
      If the questionnaire is complete and the consent is signed the participant is self-referred.&#xD;
      The participant will be invited to a video-assessment through e-boks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants are assessed using a shorter standardised diagnostic interview based on SCAN&#xD;
      (Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (21)) and supplemented with assessment&#xD;
      of health anxiety by proxy using the HAPYS. The passed information from the patient record&#xD;
      concerning the patients' somatic and psychiatric health information is necessary&#xD;
      supplementary information for conducting a thorough assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interview is conducted using an encrypted link for a video-service hosted by the Central&#xD;
      Denmark Region (rooms.rm.dk) which comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).&#xD;
      At the beginning of the interview, the health-professional ensures that the interview will be&#xD;
      uninterrupted. The participant can have lay representative present during the interview if&#xD;
      preferred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants receive written and verbal information about the project. The participants&#xD;
      receive the written information at self-referral. Verbal information is given by the&#xD;
      health-professional performing the diagnostic assessment at the Research Clinic, AUH. They&#xD;
      sign two consents; one when they complete the self-referral before the diagnostic interview,&#xD;
      which gives the responsible investigators direct access to collect information from the&#xD;
      electronic patient record for the purpose of using the participant's health information; and&#xD;
      one consent when entering the research project after the diagnostic assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Signing the final consent the participants enters the project, gives permission to publish&#xD;
      the research data, and gives permission to being contacted during the study period. In order&#xD;
      to uphold the treatment responsibility, the participant provides a phone number of a relative&#xD;
      in case of suicide suspicion. The system allows the participant to log out and log in again&#xD;
      at a later time providing the participant with the opportunity to reflect before signing the&#xD;
      consent. If the consent is not signed within two weeks after the interview the participant&#xD;
      will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The single-case experimental study will be designed with multiple baselines comparing the&#xD;
      individuals' baseline level of health anxiety by proxy with the level of health anxiety by&#xD;
      proxy during and following participation in the treatment (19, 22). In a multiple baseline&#xD;
      design, the participants have different baseline lengths but the same intervention and&#xD;
      follow-up period. The baseline and intervention period serves as two study conditions, a&#xD;
      control (baseline) and a treatment condition (intervention) with N equally spaced measurement&#xD;
      occasions(19). The base-line length is randomly assigned to the participants and serves as&#xD;
      each participants' own control-condition. This makes it possible to have a small number of&#xD;
      participants. If the intervention shows effect a change in the anxiety level will be detected&#xD;
      during the intervention period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
      All measures are self-report measures obtained through the secure web-based software platform&#xD;
      for data collection REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture)(23, 24) hosted at Aarhus&#xD;
      University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Short version of Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (20, 21)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Health Anxiety by Proxy Scale (HAPYS) (Ingeman et al., submitted)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
      The target measures of health anxiety by proxy are answered though a link in a SMS to the&#xD;
      participants every other day from start of baseline to end of follow-up. The order of the&#xD;
      items will be random each day. The target measures contain items of core characteristics of&#xD;
      health anxiety by proxy which have been selected from the HAPYS based on the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standardised self-report questionnaires will be answered four times during the study period&#xD;
      (before baseline, right before treatment entry (end of baseline), end of treatment, and at&#xD;
      4-weeks follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are asked to provide feedback on format, length and content of the treatment&#xD;
      program as well as on the contact to the therapist after each treatment-module and in a&#xD;
      semi-structured phone-interview with the Ph.D.-student after treatment end.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment is an eight-week therapist-supported internet-based program based on written&#xD;
      psychoeducation, audio-files, behavioural exposure exercises, homework and videos distributed&#xD;
      in eight short modules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis will be divided into primary outcome and secondary outcome. The primary outcome will&#xD;
      be analysed using visual analysis of plotting data and observing if the measures decreases at&#xD;
      time of intervention entry (19). Further, using a Bayesian analysis of clinically significant&#xD;
      change will quantify the evidence for the size and presence of an intervention effect (35,&#xD;
      36). The secondary outcome is analysed by determining Jacobsen's Reliable Change Index and&#xD;
      from this determine that the change seen is not at result of measurement error and whether it&#xD;
      is clinically significant(19, 37). The online free-text-answers and the interview on&#xD;
      formalities and contact to therapist will be explored using thematic analysis focusing on all&#xD;
      participant-experiences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Funding&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Ph.D.-student and the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry has initiated the&#xD;
      research project in collaboration with the Research Clinic, AUH and received funding from&#xD;
      numerous funds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project is conducted in accordance to the rules in the Helsinki-Declaration. The project&#xD;
      is registered under the Central Denmark Region's records of research projects (Den interne&#xD;
      fortegnelse over forskningsprojekter ved Region Midt; 1-16-02-921-17).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no previous research data suggesting that internet-based treatment for health&#xD;
      anxiety, anxiety or depression are associated with any form of risk (12, 14-16, 18).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data protection&#xD;
&#xD;
      All information concerning the participants is protected by the data protection act and the&#xD;
      data protection regulation. All personal data including name, telephone number and social&#xD;
      security number is encrypted. The questionnaires are not personally identifiable, but have a&#xD;
      random ID-number. The participants provide written informed consent to publish data in a&#xD;
      single-case format where each participant's data is reported separately, but anonymized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The platform hosting the treatment program was developed and programmed at the Research&#xD;
      Clinic for Functional Disorders and Psychosomatics. All access to the server goes through an&#xD;
      encrypted SSL-connection, and data pooling is being logged with IP and user-ID. NemID is used&#xD;
      to log in to the platform. Access to the questionnaire data is only granted to researchers in&#xD;
      the project and the data will be kept anonymously after project-end.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project group&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project is conducted at the Research Clinic in collaboration with the Department of Child&#xD;
      and Adolescent Psychiatry, AUH.&#xD;
