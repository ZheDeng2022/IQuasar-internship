    <textblock>
      This research study is looking to see whether the combination of Dostarlimab and Niraparib&#xD;
      plus Radiation Therapy (RT) is safe and effective in participants with metastatic triple&#xD;
      negative breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The names of the study treatment involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dostarlimab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Niraparib&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Radiation Therapy (RT), which is given per standard of care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, phase II study that will evaluate how safe and well the combination of&#xD;
      niraparib, dostarlimab, and Radiation Therapy (RT) works in metastatic triple negative breast&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Niraparib is a type of drug called a &quot;PARP inhibitor&quot;, which blocks DNA (the genetic material&#xD;
      of cells) damage from being repaired or may prevent damage from occurring in the first place.&#xD;
      In cancer treatment, inhibiting PARP may help kill cancer cells by not allowing the cancer&#xD;
      cells to repair its DNA damage or prevent DNA damage associated with metastatic triple&#xD;
      negative breast cancer from occurring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dostarlimab is a type of immunotherapy. It is believed to work by inhibiting (stopping) a&#xD;
      protein called PD-1 from working. The PD-1 protein controls parts of the immune system (the&#xD;
      system in a person's body that fights against diseases) by shutting down certain immune&#xD;
      responses that are responsible for recognizing and destroying cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators believe that dostarlimab may inhibit the PD-1 protein on triple negative&#xD;
      breast cancer cells, thus allowing the immune cells to recognize and destroy cancer&#xD;
      cells.Radiation therapy is a standard-of-care treatment that is given to stop the growth of&#xD;
      tumors. Radiation therapy can also stimulate the immune system, which leads to the&#xD;
      destruction of tumor cells in the treated areas. Combining radiation therapy with anti-cancer&#xD;
      drugs like dostarlimab and niraparib may increase the ability of the immune system to control&#xD;
      or destroy cancer cells throughout the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including&#xD;
      evaluations and follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive the study drugs for up to 2 years or until their triple negative&#xD;
      breast cancer worsens Participants will then be followed for up to 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that about 32 people will take part in this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA has not approved niraparib for metastatic triple negative breast cancer, but it has&#xD;
      been approved for other uses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved dostarlimab as treatment for any&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
