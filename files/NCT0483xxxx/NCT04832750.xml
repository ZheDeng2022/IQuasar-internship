      Advances in repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) protocols with intermittent&#xD;
      theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) have significantly decreased the duration for one single&#xD;
      session and thereby enabled accelerated treatment plans with multiple sessions per day,&#xD;
      potentially reducing the total treatment duration. This randomized, placebo-controlled study&#xD;
      investigates the effects of accelerated iTBS treatment with connectivity-informed&#xD;
      neuronavigation on symptom severity, sleep, interoception, and cognitive control in patients&#xD;
      with major depressive disorder and with or without comorbid borderline personality disorder&#xD;
      using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a safe and efficacious treatment&#xD;
      option for treatment-resistant depression. Advances in rTMS protocols with intermittent&#xD;
      theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) have significantly decreased the duration for one single&#xD;
      session and thereby enabled accelerated treatment plans with multiple sessions per day,&#xD;
      potentially reducing the total treatment duration. Major depressive disorder (MDD) is&#xD;
      characterized by impairments in various domains including sleep, impulse control, and&#xD;
      interoception. Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is characterized by fear of abandonment,&#xD;
      mood swings, and an unstable perception of self and often occurs with comorbid MDD. This&#xD;
      comorbidity frequently impedes treatment of the BPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this randomized, placebo-controlled study, 60 patients with treatment-resistant MDD (30&#xD;
      verum group, 30 sham group) and 60 patients with treatment-resistant MDD and comorbid BPD (30&#xD;
      verum group, 30 sham group) will receive two weeks of connectivity-informed iTBS of the left&#xD;
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC; 3 sessions per day, 5 days per week). Before and after&#xD;
      the treatment phase, (functional) magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) will be performed. The&#xD;
      effects of iTBS will be tested in four domains: (1) symptom severity (MDD and BPD symptoms),&#xD;
      (2) sleep quality (sleep questionnaires and various sleep parameters monitored via an&#xD;
      electroencephalography (EEG) headband), (3) neurocognitive effects (vigilance and response&#xD;
      inhibition measured with behavioral and fMRI tasks), and (4) interoception (interoceptive&#xD;
      attention measured with behavioral and fMRI tasks). Furthermore, before the start of the&#xD;
      two-weeks treatment, a single iTBS session (&quot;forecaster session&quot;) will be conducted to&#xD;
      explore the validity of early symptom/mood responses and hormonal changes for the prediction&#xD;
      of the the treatment outcome. Treatment effects will be analyzed within and across patient&#xD;
      groups (MDD and MDD + BPD). In addition, domain-specific treatment effects will be analyzed&#xD;
      as a function of distinct iTBS targets within the DLPFC.To evaluate pathological biases, the&#xD;
      investigators will compare the patients' data with a control group of 30 healthy participants&#xD;
      who will also be tested twice (without iTBS).&#xD;
