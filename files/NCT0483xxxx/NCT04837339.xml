  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transplant results vary considerably from one organ to another. Lung transplantation has&#xD;
      poorer long-term outcomes than other solid organ transplants, with a current median&#xD;
      post-transplant survival of 6.0 years. Allograft rejection remains the leading cause of&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality in all organ groups and is the leading cause of death, accounting for&#xD;
      more than 40% of deaths beyond the first year after lung transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each dysfunctions impacts the fate of the graft and therefore the survival of the recipient.&#xD;
      Their early and precise diagnosis is therefore a major issue. The identification of the&#xD;
      pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these different subtypes of dysfunction&#xD;
      (transcriptomics, polymorphism of target genes of the immune system or tissue repair, cell&#xD;
      phenotyping) is an essential step. It can only be done on the basis of a collection of&#xD;
      samples linked to a clinical database allowing to contextualize each sample.&#xD;
