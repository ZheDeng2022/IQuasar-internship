    <textblock>
      Study HC-404-FCP-2011 is a first in human, Phase 1a, multi-center, open-label study to&#xD;
      establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and evaluate the safety and tolerability of oral&#xD;
      dosing of HC-5404-FU in a dose-escalating fashion. Up to 24 qualified subjects at 3 to 5 US&#xD;
      sites, who have specific tumor types of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), gastric cancer (GC),&#xD;
      metastatic breast cancer (MBC), small cell lung cancer (SCLC), and other solid tumors (e.g.,&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer, carcinoma of unknown primary) with the&#xD;
      exception of rapidly progressing neoplasms (e.g., pancreatic cancer, glioblastoma,&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinoma) will receive HC-5404-FU. Every effort will be made to ensure&#xD;
      approximately 50% of all subjects enrolled will be subjects with RCC and GC. The starting&#xD;
      dose level is 25 mg twice daily (BID), escalating to 50, 100, and 200 mg BID as safety&#xD;
      allows, following the Bayesian Optimal Interval (BOIN) design. If MTD is not reached even at&#xD;
      the maximum dose level (200 mg BID is well tolerated), a higher dose level may be evaluated&#xD;
      based on the safety monitoring committee (SMC) recommendations after a comprehensive review&#xD;
      of the PK, safety, and efficacy data generated from the study. This Phase 1a will be expanded&#xD;
      into a Phase 1b/2a study through a protocol amendment and will then assess the dose and tumor&#xD;
      type(s) selected in Phase 1a as the most appropriate for further clinical development.&#xD;
      Subjects will be dosed until unacceptable toxicity, disease progression per immune-related&#xD;
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (iRECIST), subject withdrawal, any other&#xD;
      administrative reasons, or after 2 years of treatment, whichever occurs first. Efficacy will&#xD;
      be assessed via Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 (RECIST 1.1); computed&#xD;
      tomography (CT) scans will be conducted every 6 weeks. Safety, including occurrence of&#xD;
      dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), pharmacokinetics (PK), and biomarker parameters will also be&#xD;
      assessed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HC 5404-FU will be orally administered BID with food or within 30 minutes of completing a&#xD;
      meal, starting at 25 mg, with doses escalating to 50, 100, and 200 mg BID as safety allows.&#xD;
      Up to 24 subjects will be enrolled to ensure 12 subjects complete the study at the estimated&#xD;
      MTD of HC 5404-FU. Dosing will occur in 3-week cycles. Subjects are to spend Cycle 1/Day 1&#xD;
      (C1D1) in the clinic followed by an overnight stay for safety monitoring and PK sampling.&#xD;
      Subjects will be hospitalized for administration of first 3 doses: C1D1 am and pm doses, and&#xD;
      Cycle 1/Day 2 (C1D2) am dose; on Days 8, 15, and 21 the am dose will be taken in the clinic&#xD;
      after the planned PK samples. All other doses are to be self administered at home. After the&#xD;
      initial hospital stay at the start of study, subjects will be seen in outpatient clinic on&#xD;
      Days 8, 15, and 21 of Cycle 1 for PK assessment and thereafter, the first day of each cycle&#xD;
      for physical and laboratory assessments, adverse event (AE), and dosing compliance&#xD;
      monitoring; the end of treatment visit will also be in person in outpatient clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following completion of the treatment period of the study, subjects will be monitored for&#xD;
      survival up for up to 24 months after the last post treatment follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose escalation will follow the Bayesian Optimal Interval (BOIN) design. The decision to&#xD;
      escalate to the next dose level will be based on safety assessments after all subjects of a&#xD;
      cohort have reached the end of Cycle 1/Day 21 (DLT evaluation period). The safety monitoring&#xD;
      committee (SMC) will be responsible for dose escalation decisions, including whether to&#xD;
      modify the dose escalation based on the DLT observations and review of available PK data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The target toxicity rate of 30%, with limits of 0.236 to 0.359 for escalation/de escalation,&#xD;
      will be employed to determine the MTD. With these predefined parameters, when the observed&#xD;
      toxicity rate in a dose level is less than 0.236, the dose for the next cohort can escalate.&#xD;
      If the observed toxicity rate is higher than 0.359, the dose will de escalate. Otherwise, the&#xD;
      dose remains the same.&#xD;

    <description>HC 5404-FU (hemi fumarate salt of HC 5404) is a novel, highly selective, and potent PERK inhibitor. Preclinical pharmacological studies demonstrated high specificity of HC 5404-FU to PERK and decreased viability of tumor cells. HC 5404-FU will be orally administered BID every day with food or within 30 minutes of completing a meal, starting at 25 mg, with doses escalating to 50, 100, and 200 mg BID as safety allows for each 3-week treatment cycle.</description>

                  (e.g., pancreatic cancer, glioblastoma, hepatocellular carcinoma)&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Subjects with RCC and GC are a priority and should constitute 50% (12 subjects)&#xD;
             of the enrolled popululation. Enrollment of all others will be capped when reaching a&#xD;

             15 mm in short axis imaged by CT scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and obtained&#xD;
             by imaging within 28 days prior to screening. Tumor lesions situated in a previously&#xD;

             lesions&#xD;

             to provide fresh tissue for biomarker analysis, and, based on the adequacy of the&#xD;
             tissue sample quality, for assessment of biomarker status. Two biopsies will be&#xD;
             necessary: at baseline (within 30 days prior to first dose) and within 7 days after&#xD;
             Cycle 3/Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Newly obtained biopsy specimens are preferred to archived samples and formalin- fixed,&#xD;
             paraffin-embedded block specimens are preferred to slides. In the event a fresh&#xD;

             be provided in its place&#xD;
&#xD;
