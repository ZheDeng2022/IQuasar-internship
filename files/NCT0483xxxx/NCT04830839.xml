  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Experiencing an accident and staying in the hospital can be scary and traumatic for children.&#xD;
      The goal of this project is to develop an online resource to help children and their parents&#xD;
      develop effective coping skills to manage their stress. Children ages 8-17 who exhibit signs&#xD;
      of posttraumatic stress will view 8 online modules and attend weekly videoconferencing&#xD;
      sessions with a therapist. Parents will have 4 modules to assist them in supporting their&#xD;
      child after the injury.&#xD;

      The overarching goal of this project is to provide a research and treatment resource for the&#xD;
      management of psychological distress in children who have been hospitalized for a physical&#xD;
      trauma. The investigators will pilot an innovative, brief e-health approach to treatment of&#xD;
      PTSS designed to be delivered through the trauma system. The investigators will create&#xD;
      interactive web-based psychoeducational modules that are developmentally tailored for school&#xD;
      age children (8 to 17 years) for use with synchronous e-health therapy sessions with a&#xD;
      trained therapist. Companion modules for parents will help parents to understand and respond&#xD;
      to their child's PTSS. The investigators will perform a single-arm pilot trial of a brief&#xD;
      e-health approach to treatment of PTSS (i.e., Recovery after Stress Toolkit; ReSeT). ( delete&#xD;
      with usual care.)&#xD;

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Child post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Child PTSS from pre-intervention (within 6 months of the injury discharge) will be compared to the child's PTSS post-intervention, at 12 weeks post-enrollment or until the child has finished treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>The Child Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Scale (CPSS; Foa et al, 2001) is a validated child report and parent proxy measure of PTSS. The measure is comprised of 24-items. The CPSS includes 17 questions mapping on to DSM-IV symptoms of PTSD rated on a 4-point scale that indicates how frequently each symptom occurs (0 = not at all, 1 = once a week or less/once in a while, 2 = 2 to 4 times a week/half the time, 3 = 5 or more times a week/almost always). In addition, the CPSS includes seven questions regarding functional impairment. These questions are scored dichotomously as absent (0) or present (1). Scores range from 0 - 7, with higher scores indicating greater functional impairment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Child anxiety symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Child anxiety from pre-intervention (within 6 months of the injury discharge) will be compared to child anxiety post-intervention, at 12 weeks post-enrollment or until the child has finished treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>The Screen Child Anxiety and Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED; Birmaher et al., 1999) is a widely used questionnaire that screens for anxiety and emotional disorders in children. The child self-report version will be used in this study, which consists of 41 items rated on a 3-point Likert scale ( 0 = not true or hardly ever true, 1 = somewhat true or sometimes true, 2 = very true or often true). This measures yields raw scores for anxiety disorder, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, separation anxiety, social anxiety disorder, and significant school avoidance.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Child quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>Child quality of life from pre-intervention (within 6 months of the injury discharge) will be compared to child quality of life post-intervention, at 12 weeks post-enrollment or until the child has finished treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL 4.0; Varni et al., 2001) is a well-validated parent- report measure consisting of 15 items that takes less than 5 minutes to complete. The PedsQL evaluates health-related quality of life by assessing the dimensions of physical, emotional, social, and cognitive functioning in children from infancy to 18 years of life age. The total quality of life scale score will be utilized.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Child depressive symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Child depressive symptoms from pre-intervention (within 6 months of the injury discharge) will be compared to child depressive symptoms post-intervention, at 12 weeks post-enrollment or until the child has finished treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS; Varni et al., 2014) is a National Institutes of Health (NIH) initiative created to advance assessment of patient-reported outcomes. The PROMIS Pediatric Cooperative Group has developed pediatric self-report item banks across five generic health domains that have been further delineated into eight latent structures. The current study will use both the pediatric self-report and parent proxy short forms for the anger, anxiety, depression, psychological stress, and physical stress scales which are each eight items and the global health scale which is seven items. Additionally, the eight item sleep disturbance questionnaire will be completed by parents.</description>

    <description>ReSeT is comprised of interactive web-based psychoeducational modules that are developmentally tailored for school age children (8-17 years) for use with synchronous e-health therapy sessions with a trained therapist.&#xD;
Participants in the ReSeT treatment will complete 8 modules and therapy sessions. Parents will also have access to 4 modules During the study, children/youth will be asked to complete all eight sessions of the online treatment together with the therapist over an 8 -12 week time period (to allow for scheduling/cancellations). For younger children, parents will participate in the beginning and end of each session. Sessions will last approximately 30-60 minutes and will occur approximately every week for an anticipated 4-8 hour time commitment. Parents of older children will be permitted to review the content independently and participate in feedback sessions.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ages of 8 to 17 years at time of enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hospitalized for trauma at one of the following sites: PICU, ward or rapid&#xD;
             treatment/observation unit (less than 23 hours stay)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Both the parent and the child participating have the ability to read and speak English&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have broadband internet availability at their home address&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Elevated post-traumatic stress symptoms (If the child exhibits clinically significant&#xD;
             PTSS determined with the CPSS [Foa et al., 2001] with a score greater than or equal to&#xD;
             11 on the sum of the highest item by item score of parent/child report, they will be&#xD;
             invited to participate in the pilot intervention. This methodology for using a joint&#xD;
             score on the CPSS was informed by previous work indicating that both parents and&#xD;
             children tend to underreport PTSS symptoms. Thus, implementing a multi-informant&#xD;
             approach yields a more valid estimation of a child's psychopathology.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has sustained a moderate or severe TBI, as defined by a Glasgow Coma Score of less&#xD;
             than 13&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has been diagnosed with moderate or severe intellectual disability , low functioning&#xD;
             autism spectrum disorder, or a developmental disability (This will be determined by&#xD;
             medical chart review and confirmed with parent report: Has the child ever been&#xD;
             diagnosed with an intellectual or developmental disability? i.e., child must be able&#xD;
             to talk; the rationale for this is that they may have difficulty mastering the course&#xD;
             content)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a pre-existing severe psychiatric disorder that required prior psychiatric&#xD;
             hospitalization (e.g., bipolar disorder, schizophrenia)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The mechanism of the injury was abuse or interpersonal violence&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They are currently receiving psychotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has been hospitalized for their injury for over 30 days&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No attempt will be made to recruit caregivers while their child is unstable, e.g.&#xD;
             vitals are abnormal, there are major complications, or death may be imminent. Children&#xD;
             with multiple injuries are eligible to participate but their caregivers will not be&#xD;
             approached until any interventions (surgery, casting, etc.) are completed.&#xD;
