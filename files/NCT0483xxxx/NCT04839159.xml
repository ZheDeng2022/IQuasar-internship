  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sickle cell disease is associated with significant morbi-mortality hence the interest in an&#xD;
      early and targeted care. At present, there is no plasmatic marker able to identify infants at&#xD;
      higher risk of developping severe complications later in life. However, recent studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated a correlation between certain complications of the disease and biomarkers of the&#xD;
      endothelial dysfunction characterizing it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators prospectively followed a cohort of children diagnosed with SCD through the&#xD;
      universal neonatal screening using inflammatory and haemostatic plasmatic markers to study&#xD;
      their annual evolution. Investigators then will evaluate potential associations between these&#xD;
      biological markers and the occurrence of SCD related complications. A secondary objective of&#xD;
      this study is to evaluate the repercussions of therapeutic intervention on these markers.&#xD;
