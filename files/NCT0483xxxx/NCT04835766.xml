    <textblock>
      This study is a unique one as it si done for first time to all patients following bladder&#xD;
      injury in PAS surgery. Bladder function will be assessed by urodynamic study.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be initially assessed by overactive bladder (OAB) and incontinence&#xD;
      questionnaire. Examination was done to determine any neurological, or congenital&#xD;
      abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urodynamic study (UDS) will done for all patients. The patients will be asked to drink fluids&#xD;
      to obtain a comfortably full bladder. Initially, a pelvic-abdominal ultrasound was done&#xD;
      followed by the UDS. Urodynamic study consisted of uroflowmetry (volume: â‰¥150 ml and Qmax:&#xD;
      20-30 ml/s); filling cystometry in physiological or medium filling rate of 40 ml/min (using&#xD;
      normal saline at room temperature through a double lumen urethral catheter); stress leak&#xD;
      test; and pressure flow study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No sedation will be administered during the study as the patient should be aware. The&#xD;
      patients were placed in a semi-seated lithotomy position. After a detailed explanation to the&#xD;
      patient, the examination will begin by passing a catheter into the bladder (5 Fr) to measure&#xD;
      the postvoiding residual urine followed by filling the bladder and measuring the intravesical&#xD;
      pressure through the catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A rectal catheter was placed for measuring the abdominal pressure. The systems will be always&#xD;
      zeroed at the atmospheric pressure. The patients will be periodically asked to cough to check&#xD;
      the operation of the equipment and instructed to report her sensations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The volume of the first sensation of filling, first desire (1 s) and second desire (2 s) were&#xD;
      recorded. When the bladder was filled up to 150 ml, patients were asked to cough (Valsalva)&#xD;
      to predict the stress leakage. If not occur at 150 ml, the bladder was refilled, and the&#xD;
      stress test was repeated until the leakage occurred or the bladder capacity was reached.&#xD;
      Additionally, any unidentified involuntary detrusor contractions will be noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the patient had the urge to void, the permission for voiding will be given. Then voiding&#xD;
      cystometrogram (pressure-flow) was performed and the urodynamic parameters, such as maximum&#xD;
      flow rate (Qmax) and detrusor pressure at maximum flow (Pdet Qmax) will be observed.&#xD;

        This study is multi-center descriptive cohort study. This study will be conducted at&#xD;
        Urology departments. Cases were recruited from both Obstetrics and gynecology and Urology&#xD;
        departments of Al-Azhar University and Tanta University. All cases had past history of&#xD;
        bladder injury during PAS surgery either by hysterectomy or uterine sparing techniques.&#xD;
