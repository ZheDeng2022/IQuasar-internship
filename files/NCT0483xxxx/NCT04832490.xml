  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      extremity trauma is a frequent reason for emergency room visits. There is an increase in the&#xD;
      use of CT scanners in extremity trauma, due to a greater sensitivity of detection than&#xD;
      X-rays, particularly for &quot;occult fractures&quot; and for the organization of treatment,&#xD;
      particularly surgical treatment. As the number of CT scans increases, the reduction of the&#xD;
      delivered dose has become a subject of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the many methods used, the use of iterative reconstruction has enabled a substantial&#xD;
      reduction in the delivered dose without compromising image quality: low-dose and&#xD;
      ultra-low-dose protocols (effective dose equivalent to the effective dose of the Diagnostic&#xD;
      Reference Levels of radiographs from the same region of interest) have been developped, but&#xD;
      have not yet been evaluated in extremity trauma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject of our feasibility study is to evaluate the diagnostic performance of ultra-low&#xD;
      dose CT compared to radiographs in patients consulting for extremity trauma in the emergency&#xD;
      room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recent implementation in our department of a scanner dedicated to low-dose explorations&#xD;
      as well as the optimization of protocols has allowed the realization of ultra-low-dose scans&#xD;
      since June 2017.&#xD;

      The study included all consecutive adult patients who consulted for trauma to the&#xD;
      extremities, i.e. hands and wrists, feet and ankles, in the emergency department between&#xD;
      February and August 2018. Patients included had undergone digital radiography and ULD-CT for&#xD;
      a diagnosis of trauma during weekdays, during working hours (9am-6pm), excluding weekends and&#xD;
      holidays. Patients with severe polytrauma requiring a whole body CT scan and patients for&#xD;
      whom digital radiography was not the first imaging modality performed were not included in&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ULD-CT images were acquired using a Somatom Definition AS+ CT-scan (Siemens Healthineers).&#xD;
      Acquisition parameters were as follows: beam collimation of 64×0.6 mm; field of view of 500&#xD;
      mm; pitch factor of 0.85; rotation time of 1.0 s. The tube voltage was fixed at 80 kVp, and&#xD;
      the tube current was set at 12 mAs for hands and wrists and at 15 mAs for feet and ankles.&#xD;
      Both the automatic adjustment of tube voltage (CARE kV) and the automatic tube current&#xD;
      modulation (CARE Dose4D) were disabled. The images were reconstructed in transverse plane of&#xD;
      1-mm thickness and 0.7mm overlapping, and raw data were reconstructed using the level 4 of&#xD;
      the SAFIRE® (Sinogram Affirmed Iterative Reconstruction) algorithm. The reconstruction&#xD;
      kernels used were &quot;moderately smooth&quot; (I30f) for soft tissue exploration and &quot;strongly sharp&quot;&#xD;
      (I70f) for bone exploration for all locations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging interpretation Image analysis and interpretation were performed retrospectively in a&#xD;
      blinded manner by two radiologists, a junior reader with a 3-year experience (TA, reader 1)&#xD;
      and a senior reader with a 11-year experience (FS, reader 2). The two radiologists separately&#xD;
      analyzed all radiographs after image anonymization and randomization of the reading rank. To&#xD;
      limit interpretation biases, a period of 4 weeks was observed before interpretation of the&#xD;
      ULD-CT images. They were analyzed separately by the two same radiologists, in the same&#xD;
      blinded manner than radiographs, also after randomization of the reading rank. The images&#xD;
      were visualized on GE Healthcare Centricity Picture Archiving and Communication System&#xD;
      (PACS); all ULD-CT images were read in multiplanar 3-mm reconstructed slices.&#xD;

        The study included all consecutive adult patients consulting for trauma of the extremities,&#xD;
        i.e. hands and wrists and feet and ankles, at the emergency department. Patients included&#xD;
        had underwent both digital radiography and ULD-CT for trauma diagnosis during week days,&#xD;
        within working hours (9am-6pm), excluding week-ends and public holidays. Patients with&#xD;
        severe polytraumas requiring a whole body-scan and patients for whom digital radiography&#xD;
        was not the first imaging modality performed were not included in the study.&#xD;
