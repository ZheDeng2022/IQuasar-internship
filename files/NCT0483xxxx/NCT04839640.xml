      Visit 1: Clinical examination and investigations will be carried out for the eligible&#xD;
      patients including TMJ examination and intraoral examination for oral mucosa. Diagnostic&#xD;
      charts will be prepared with full medical and dental history as well as radiographic records.&#xD;
      Primary impression will be performed with irreversible hydro-colloid impression material&#xD;
      (alginate), The impressions will be poured with type IV dental stone to obtain diagnostic&#xD;
      casts, special tray will be constructed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2: Maxillary Face-bow will be recorded to mount the upper cast. The diagnostic casts&#xD;
      will be mounted on semi adjustable articulator in centric occluding relation to evaluate the&#xD;
      inter-arch distance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3: Secondary impression will be performed in special trays by elastomeric impression&#xD;
      material. The impression will be poured into typeIV dental stone in order to obtain master&#xD;
      cast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 4: Trial denture base will be constructed and tried in patient's mouth for obtaining&#xD;
      maxilla-mandibular relation using face bow record and centric relation record, then mounting&#xD;
      of the casts on semi adjustable articulator will be done. The teeth will be set according to&#xD;
      the randomization group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 5: The denture bases will be tried in with acrylic teeth in patient's mouth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 6: The denture will be delivered to the patient and occlusal adjustments will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 7: Recall visit after one week, further adjustments will be done. The denture will be&#xD;
      sent to the scanning center and given to the patient again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 8: At 3 months follow up, the denture will be inspected for calculus and will be&#xD;
      immersed in ultrasonic cleaner for 15 seconds to remove calculus and then scanned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 9: At 6 months follow up, the denture will be inspected for calculus and will be&#xD;
      immersed in ultrasonic cleaner for 15 seconds to remove calculus and then scanned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 10: At 9 months follow up, the denture will be inspected for calculus and will be&#xD;
      immersed in ultrasonic cleaner for 15 seconds to remove calculus and then scanned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The optical methods tend to fulfill the need for quantitative characterization of surface&#xD;
      topography. Specimens will be photographed using USB Digital microscope with a built-in&#xD;
      camera (Scope Capture Digital Microscope, Guangdong, China) connected with an IBM compatible&#xD;
      personal computer using a fixed magnification of 120X.The images will be recorded with a&#xD;
      resolution of 1280 × 1024 pixels per image. Digital microscope images will be cropped using&#xD;
      Microsoft office picture manager to specify/standardize area of roughness measurement. The&#xD;
      cropped images will be analyzed using WSxM software. Specimens will be photographed using USB&#xD;
      Digital microscope with a built-in camera (Scope Capture Digital Microscope, Guangdong,&#xD;
      China) connected with an IBM compatible personal computer using a fixed magnification of&#xD;
      120X. The images will be recorded with a resolution of 1280 × 1024 pixels per image. Digital&#xD;
      microscope images will be cropped to 350 x 400 pixels using Microsoft office picture manager&#xD;
      to specify/standardize area of roughness measurement. The cropped images will be analyzed&#xD;
      using WSxM software.&#xD;
