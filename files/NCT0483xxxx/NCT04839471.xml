  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single arm, multi-center study, assessing efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      BI-754091 in combination with afatinib as treatment in patients with advanced or metastatic&#xD;
      ESCC refractory to at least 1 line of systemic treatment (including chemotherapy or radiation&#xD;
      therapy).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Esophageal cancer (EsC) is the sixth leading cancer in the world and is a complex disease&#xD;
      with heterogenous subgroups. The squamous cell carcinoma subgroup usually involves the upper&#xD;
      part of esophagus and typically occurs in mid-age males. Standard treatment for esophageal&#xD;
      squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) utilizes a trimodality approach comprising of surgery&#xD;
      (including resection and reconstruction and/or feeding tube support), radiotherapy and&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Addition of tyrosine kinase inhibitors has not shown a benefit in advanced or&#xD;
      metastatic ESCC. Immunotherapy, especially checkpoint inhibitors that target the PD-1/PD-L1&#xD;
      axis, have demonstrated clinical benefit in phase III trials for head neck squamous cell&#xD;
      carcinoma (HNSCC). This led to the anticipation that immunotherapy could also be useful ESCC&#xD;
      due to similar histologic cell types, but before the results presented from KEYNOTE-181, no&#xD;
      phase III trial have proven such benefit. It must be emphasized that KEYNOTE-180, KEYNOTE-181&#xD;
      and ONO-4538-07 demonstrated efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors in ESCC patients were&#xD;
      only 14.3-17%; furthermore, USFDA approved pembrolizumab monotherapy for second line&#xD;
      treatment in advanced esophageal cancer only with CPS score≧10. Thus, the benefit of&#xD;
      immunotherapy in patients with CPS score less than 10 remains uncertain. With effective&#xD;
      target therapy and immunotherapy options lacking, there is a huge unmet need for chemotherapy&#xD;
      resistant, advanced or metastatic ESCC. In light of a recent retrospective cohort study&#xD;
      demonstrating clinical benefit of using pembrolizumab combined with afatinib for refractory&#xD;
      HNSCC, the investigators decide to implement the similar regimen (afatinib plus BI704591) in&#xD;
      ESCC patients who had failed multiple lines of chemotherapy&#xD;
