  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, single blinded, placebo-controlled trial to study the effectiveness of&#xD;
      a subanesthetic dose (0.6mg/kg) of ketamine versus placebo (saline) on postoperative pain on&#xD;
      adult women undergoing mastectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to examine the effect of a subanesthetic dose (0.6mg/kg) of&#xD;
      ketamine vs. saline control on postoperative pain in subjects who have undergone mastectomy.&#xD;
