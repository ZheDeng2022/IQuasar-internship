      The purpose of this Cohort Treatment Plan is to allow access to eltrombopag for eligible&#xD;
      patients diagnosed with medically significant thrombocytopenia. The patient's Treating&#xD;
      Physician should follow the suggested treatment guidelines and comply with all local health&#xD;
      authority regulations.&#xD;

    <description>Eltrombopag should be taken at least two hours before or four hours after any products such as antacids, dairy products, or mineral supplements containing polyvalent cation (e.g. aluminum, calcium, iron, magnesium, selenium and zinc).

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients eligible for inclusion in this Treatment Plan have to meet all of the following&#xD;
        criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        - Written informed consent must be obtained prior to any screening procedures or treatment&#xD;
        assignment. If consent cannot be expressed in writing, it must be formally documented and&#xD;
        witnessed, ideally via an independent trusted witness. An acceptable alternative (e.g., an&#xD;
        assent form, or consent from a parent or guardian) should be signed for legally incompetent&#xD;
        patients (e.g., children).&#xD;
&#xD;
        - In addition to informed consent, patients eligible for inclusion in this Treatment Plan&#xD;
        may not be enrolled into any other eltrombopag clinical trial and must meet all of the&#xD;
        following criteria (only one of the diseases listed under criterion No 1 is enough):&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 14&#xD;
             days of first dose of program treatment and agree to use effective contraception,&#xD;

             effective methods of contraception while taking study treatment and for 3 months after&#xD;
             stopping medication. Highly effective methods of contraception methods include:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of&#xD;
                  the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,&#xD;
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of&#xD;
                  contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without&#xD;
                  hysterectomy), total hysterectomy, or tubal ligation at least six weeks before&#xD;
                  taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive&#xD;
                  status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). For female patients on&#xD;
                  the study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that&#xD;
                  patient&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Use of oral (estrogen and progesterone), injected or implanted hormonal methods&#xD;
                  of contraception or placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine&#xD;
                  system (IUS), or other forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable&#xD;
                  efficacy (failure rate &lt; 1%), for example, hormone vaginal ring or transdermal&#xD;
                  hormone contraception..&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  In case of use of oral contraception women should have been stable on the same&#xD;
                  pill for a minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they&#xD;
                  have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate&#xD;
                  clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had&#xD;
                  surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy), total&#xD;
                  hysterectomy or tubal ligation at least six weeks in advance. In the case of&#xD;
                  oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been&#xD;
                  confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child&#xD;
                  bearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Sexually active males must be willing to use a condom during intercourse while taking&#xD;
             study treatment and for 3 months after stopping study treatment. A condom is required&#xD;
             for all sexually active male participants to prevent them from fathering a child AND&#xD;
             to prevent delivery of study treatment via seminal fluid to their partner. In&#xD;
             addition, male participants must not donate sperm for the time period specified above.&#xD;
&#xD;
        If local regulations deviate from the contraception methods listed above to prevent&#xD;
        pregnancy, local regulations apply and will be described in the informed consent form&#xD;
        (ICF).&#xD;
&#xD;
        No additional exclusions may be applied by the investigator, in order to ensure that the&#xD;
        study population will be representative of all eligible patients.&#xD;
