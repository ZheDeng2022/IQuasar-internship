  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective clinical trial aiming to determine the ability of an AI pipeline to&#xD;
      identify women who would benefit from supplemental MRI in terms of decreasing the number of&#xD;
      cancers having a significantly delayed detection&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All women attending mammography screening at Karolinska University Hospital will have their&#xD;
      mammograms analyzed by AI (Figure 1). The specific AI-implementation (AI tool) in this study&#xD;
      is a result of AI predictions from three equally weighted component AI models analyzing&#xD;
      mammograms: (i) masking predictor, (ii) risk predictor and (iii) cancer signs predictor (by&#xD;
      one commercial CAD model and one in-house academic CAD model); the age of the woman is also&#xD;
      taken into account by multiplying the score with (110-age)/70. The purpose of the age factor&#xD;
      is to attain a relatively similar proportion of MRI exams in the lower and higher age groups.&#xD;
      The aim of the AI tool is to identify women with the highest probability of having a delay in&#xD;
      cancer detection, i.e., having had a false negative screening mammogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific AI tool and its settings will remain the same during the study. For each&#xD;
      examination, the AI tool will produce an AI Joint Score and an AI Masking Score. Women having&#xD;
      an AI Masking Score above the threshold and an AI Joint Score above the threshold will be&#xD;
      invited to the study unless they met exclusion criteria. Women who decide to participate,&#xD;
      will be randomized to MRI or no-MRI (standard-of-care).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Signa Premier 3T MRI scanner from GE Healthcare will be used. The MRI protocol will contain&#xD;
      a T2-weighted Dixon sequence and a T1-weighted dynamic contrast enhanced series, and will&#xD;
      remain the same through the course of the study. All MRI exams will be assessed by two&#xD;
      radiologists, where the second reader will have access to the assessment of the first reader.&#xD;
      In case of disagreement, a consensus discussion between two radiologists will be held. The&#xD;
      MRI exams will be assessed according to BI-RADS, and follow-up will depend on the BI-RADS&#xD;
      category (Figure 2). Women with BI-RADS 1-2 will have no further diagnostics and will be sent&#xD;
      a 'healthy letter'. Women with BI-RADS 3 to 5 will be recalled for 2nd look ultrasound. Women&#xD;
      with BI-RADS 4-5 will be included in the regular process for established cancer suspicion and&#xD;
      be discussed in a multidisciplinary team conference. For women with BI-RADS 3, the follow-up&#xD;
      will be handled within the breast radiology unit.&#xD;
