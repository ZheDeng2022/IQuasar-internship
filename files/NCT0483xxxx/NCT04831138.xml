  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) including Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL) will be performed&#xD;
      before, during, and after the treatment, in a total of up to 6 MRI sessions until 7 months&#xD;
      after the first session, or when progression is clinically indicated. Thereafter, patients&#xD;
      will be followed through standard clinical examinations for the next 3 years or until demise,&#xD;
      whichever occurs first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinically, metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients are imaged every 2-3 months after&#xD;
      the initiation of anti-angiogenic therapy, since morphological (i.e. size) changes are not&#xD;
      anticipated earlier. However, our preliminary experience has shown functional changes&#xD;
      including perfusion as early as 2-weeks after the initiation of the treatment. T0, T1, and T2&#xD;
      sessions will be performed for this proposal, while T3, T4, and T5 will be performed along&#xD;
      with the clinical imaging sessions. All MR imaging sessions will be scheduled within ±1 or ±2&#xD;
      weeks of the target time period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research MR imaging may take approximately an additional 15 minutes per each imaging&#xD;
      session, when done in conjunction with the clinical imaging. The T0, T1, and T2 research MR&#xD;
      imaging sessions will be performed additionally for the purpose of this study, with each&#xD;
      taking approximately one hour.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of kidney cancer has steadily increased over the past three to four decades and&#xD;
      is among the 10 most frequently diagnosed cancers in the US. Approximately 63,990 new cases&#xD;
      of kidney cancer are estimated in 2017 and the prognosis has been historically poor. The&#xD;
      current 5-year survival rates are estimated at 74% overall, decreasing to 53% among patients&#xD;
      with locally advanced diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most common form of kidney cancer, renal cell carcinoma (RCC), occurs in 90% of all&#xD;
      kidney cancers. Among patients with localized RCC who are treated with nephrectomy,&#xD;
      approximately one quarter have relapses in distant sites. Among patients with metastatic RCC,&#xD;
      the 5-year survival rates are approximately 8%. With better understanding of the pathogenesis&#xD;
      of the most common type of RCC, clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), newer treatment&#xD;
      options with new agents are being developed to increase survival rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The high cost and potential risks associated with human trials for the newly developed&#xD;
      experimental therapies have emphasized the need for sensitive monitoring of tumor response.&#xD;
      Imaging approaches can play an important role in the evaluation and selection of potential&#xD;
      new therapies with non-invasive longitudinal monitoring of treatment response. Currently, the&#xD;
      radiological assessment of treatment outcomes predominantly relies on morphological (i.e.&#xD;
      size) changes using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) and other&#xD;
      similar scores. This is a major limiting factor as the effects of many therapeutic agents at&#xD;
      the microscopic level precede the eventual changes in tumor size. One such tumor property&#xD;
      that has gained increased attention is angiogenesis, which has been shown to support tumor&#xD;
      proliferation and infiltration. Increasing numbers of clinical trials have begun targeting&#xD;
      tumor vascular supplies by directly inhibiting angiogenesis (e.g. antiangiogenic therapy).&#xD;
      Such clinical trials and the eventual clinical use of these therapies would be greatly&#xD;
      assisted by the availability of robust imaging indicators of angiogenesis (i.e. tissue&#xD;
      perfusion).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Positron Emission Tomography (PET) using 15O-labeled water (15O-PET) is considered the gold&#xD;
      standard for non-invasive measurement of tissue perfusion. However, the use of 15O-PET&#xD;
      requires a cyclotron in close proximity to PET to produce short lived 15O-water (half life&#xD;
      2.4 min), limiting its applicability in clinical settings. Alternative imaging techniques&#xD;
      include ultrasound using microbubbles, perfusion computed tomography (CT) using iodinated&#xD;
      contrast agent and perfusion MRI using gadolinium based contrast agents. All of these&#xD;
      techniques require exogenous agents, restricting their use in longitudinal monitoring of&#xD;
      treatment response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ASL-MRI has recently emerged as a quantitative imaging (QI) method to measure perfusion (or&#xD;
      capillary blood flow) without the administration of exogenous contrast agents. ASL&#xD;
      magnetically &quot;labels&quot; the highly permeable water in the blood as a tracer and measures their&#xD;
      accumulation in the tissue of interest, without injecting any exogeneous contrast. Various&#xD;
      versions of ASL have been validated in animals using microspheres, and in humans using&#xD;
      15O-PET in the brain. ASL also has a number of advantages compared to dynamic contrast&#xD;
      enhanced (DCE) and dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) based MR perfusion measurements.&#xD;
      Specifically, ASL does not require exogenous agent alleviating the concerns of gadolinium&#xD;
      accumulation or nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) in patients with impaired renal function&#xD;
      and, unlike DCE/DSC, the contribution of vascular permeability to ASL measured perfusion is&#xD;
      negligible enabling absolute perfusion quantification in physiological units.&#xD;
