      This is the first baseline pilot-study that will evaluate the NP and OP colonization with the&#xD;
      underline of pneumococcal serotype distribution among adults older than 50 years of age in&#xD;
      Serbia and Southeastern Europe. Results of this project will serve as additional evidence in&#xD;

      Research center(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research will be carried out by the:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Institute of Public Health of Vojvodina&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Centre for Disease Control and Prevention and the Centre for Microbiology&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Health Care Centre of Novi Sad&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Department of General Medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample processing To confirm the NP and OP carriage, sampling will include NP and OP swabs.&#xD;
      Swabs will be collected by the general practitioners in the Health Care Centre of Novi Sad&#xD;
      and will transport, within 24h of collection, to the Centre for Microbiology of Institute of&#xD;
      Public Health of Vojvodina, Novi Sad. The sterile cotton-tipped wire swabs will be inserted&#xD;
      into the anterior nares, gently rubbed on the NP swab wall and immediately placed in&#xD;
      transport medium (Copan Venturi Transystem, Brescia, Italy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory procedure Within the laboratory NP swabs will be analyzed by 200 μl of&#xD;
      swab-inoculated STGG media will be transferred to 5.0 ml Todd Hewitt broth containing 0,5%&#xD;
      yeast extract (THY) and 1 ml of rabbit serum and incubated at 35-37 °C for six hours.&#xD;
      Cultured broth will be plated on sheep blood agar and incubated in 5% CO2 at 35-37 °C. After&#xD;
      18-24 hours of incubation, plates will be examined for the appearance of alpha-haemolytic&#xD;
      colonies resembling streptococci. Positive samples will be cultured, and optochin disc and&#xD;
      bile solubility test will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Molecular serotyping&#xD;
&#xD;
      DNA Extraction To obtain DNA extracts for PCR reactions, an overnight growth of blood agar&#xD;
      plate will be suspended in in 300 μl of 0.85% NaCl, heated to 70 °C for 15 min, spinned for 2&#xD;
      min and supernatant will be removed. Pellet will be suspended in 50 μl TE buffer with an&#xD;
      addition of 10 μl mutanolysin and 8 μl of hyaluronidase, kept at 37°C for 30 min (to&#xD;
      overnight), heated for 10 min at 100°C and spinned for 4 min. No more than 2,5 μl of&#xD;
      supernatant will be used as DNA template. Extracts will be stored at -20°C until PCR testing&#xD;
      (9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identification of S. pneumoniae Identification of S. pneumoniae will be achieved by&#xD;
      amplifying the lytA gene using primers and probes recommended by CDC and Quanta Biosciences&#xD;
      PerfeCTa1 qPCR ToughMix1, Low RoxTM (Quanta Biosciences, Beverly, USA) (10). LytA positive&#xD;
      samples will be further analyzed for serotype identification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serotype identification Conventional multiplex PCR assays will be performed as a series of&#xD;
      multiplex reactions, using CDC recommended schemes and primers for pneumococcal serotype&#xD;
      deduction and 2X PCR Buffer - QIAGEN Multiplex PCR Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The PCR&#xD;
      products will be analyzed on 2% NuSieve agarose gels (Cambrex Bio Science, Inc., Rockland,&#xD;
      ME), stained with ethidium bromide. Gel images will be recorded BioDocAnalyze system&#xD;
      (Analytik Jena, Jena, Germany).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Real Time PCR will be performed optionally in case of any difficulties with conventional PCR.&#xD;
      IT will be performed, as a series of 21 monoplex assays encompassing 21 serotypes using CDC&#xD;
      recommended schemes based on geographic prevalence of serotypes. The assays are multiplexed&#xD;
      in a sequential triplex format (three targets/serotypes in one reaction), each detecting&#xD;
      targets on FAM, Rox (or Cy5) and Hex channels. Reactions will be performed on ABI 7500&#xD;
      Instruments (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA), using specific primers and probes and&#xD;
      Invitrogen-Platinum Quantitive PCR SuperMix (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Susceptibility testing Susceptibility of Spn isolates to Optochin, Oxacilin, Norfloxacin,&#xD;
      Erytromycin, Clindamycin, Tetracycline and Trimetroprim-sulfometoxazole will be determined by&#xD;
      the Diffusion method according to the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility&#xD;
      Testing (EUCAST, www.eucast.org).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This baseline assessment is taking into consideration to present descriptive only current&#xD;
      results, but they are not separately taken into account for comparative analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of laboratory testing, conducted for each patient, will forwarded to elected&#xD;
      physicians who indicated sampling of patient material.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures Adults will be recruited during their health examination at Health Care&#xD;
      Centre of Novi Sad by their elected physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After providing a verbal and written explanation of the research aim (Appendix 1), informed&#xD;
      consent (Appendix 2) will be obtained from subjects before enrolment. Personal and&#xD;
      confidential information obtained from participants will be removed, except for demographic&#xD;
      information, including date of sampling, age, gender, data on previous upper respiratory&#xD;
      tract infection, number of children (siblings) aged 0-10 years residing in the household of&#xD;
      participants with pneumococcal and influenza immunization history (because influenza&#xD;
      immunization may prevent pneumococcal superinfections), smoking habits of participants and&#xD;
      their household members and the information about home residence (Survey Questionnaire-&#xD;
      Appendix 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples will be provided as one NP swab per study subject. Every participant will be assigned&#xD;
      only once.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confirmed case is every laboratory tested participant in which, after testing (PCR or ELISA),&#xD;
      a positive result is obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis and Sample Size Justification Collection of the data Characteristics of&#xD;
      all respondents acquired by questionnaire from Novi Sad, the test results of laboratory&#xD;
      testing of samples of participants and the final characterization of Spn serotypes will be&#xD;
      entered in specially designed database. Personal information of participants will be removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigator of the research along with statistician will analyze the collected data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size justification In accordance with the sample size calculation for a study&#xD;
      estimating a population prevalence (11), between 350 and 500 samples are planned to be&#xD;
      collected. We presume to detect pneumococci in up to 10% PCR-positive to Spn. Total number of&#xD;
      adults older than 50 years of age is around 120,000, and therefore we expect to collect the&#xD;
      sample up to 0.4% of the total targeted population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results After carefully implementation of the research, we expected that Spn&#xD;
      carriage among adults older than 50 years of age will be present in less than 10% of the&#xD;
      total population. In addition, we presume that Spn serotypes covered by PPV or PCV will&#xD;
      represent more than 60% and 50% of the serotypes in overall distribution among tested&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methods We will examine associations between risk factors and NP and OP carriage&#xD;
      of pneumococci in participants aged older than 50 years. The following factors will be&#xD;
      examined as possible risk factors in covered population: age, gender, data on previous upper&#xD;
      respiratory tract infection, number of children (siblings) aged 0-10 years residing in the&#xD;
      household of participants with pneumococcal and influenza immunization history, smoking&#xD;
      habits of participants and their household members and the information about home residence.&#xD;
      These factors will be analyzed by univariate and multivariate analyses (if appropriate).&#xD;
      Also, the prevalence of NP and OP carriage as the proportion of participants whose&#xD;
      nasopharyngeal cultures were positive for Spn and corresponding 95% confidence intervals will&#xD;
      be estimated. All descriptive analyses will be performed using the SPSS Statistics software&#xD;
      Version 21.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA).&#xD;
