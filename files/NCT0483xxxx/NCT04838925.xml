    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop and test the feasibility of a commercially-ready&#xD;
      mobile neurofeedback app for individuals with chronic pain. Thirty (30) participants who are&#xD;
      prescribed opioids for chronic pain will use the new mobile neurofeedback app and an EEG&#xD;
      headset for 10 minutes at a time, 4 times a week for 12 weeks and provide feedback about&#xD;
      using the app.&#xD;

      In this STTR Phase I project, CrossComm will collaborate with Duke University to develop a&#xD;
      commercial-ready mobile neurofeedback technology and test its feasibility among patients&#xD;
      using opioids to treat chronic pain. Specific Aim 1 is to develop a commercial-ready mobile&#xD;
      neurofeedback app and will be built according to commercial standards of robustness and&#xD;
      maintainability. Specific Aim 2 is to test feasibility of the commercially available mobile&#xD;
      app in N=30 patients with chronic pain prescribed opioids. Participants will be recruited for&#xD;
      a baseline interview with the Duke Behavioral Health &amp; Technology Lab after passing a&#xD;
      preliminary telephone screen. After providing informed consent, participants will provide&#xD;
      data on demographics, pain symptoms, and opioid consumption. Each participant will download&#xD;
      the mobile neurofeedback app to their smartphone and be instructed to use the intervention&#xD;
      for 10 minutes a day, 4 times a week for 12 weeks. Study coordinators will conduct four&#xD;
      teleconference sessions (weeks 1, 3, 6 and 9) to reinforce training, troubleshoot&#xD;
      difficulties, and support intervention utilization. After the 12-week mobile neurofeedback&#xD;
      intervention, the investigators will collect follow-up data, including pain measures, mobile&#xD;
      app (usage, satisfaction, &amp; usability), and user feedback on the human-computer interface.&#xD;
      Data from these will inform further app refinement preparing for STTR Phase II.&#xD;

    <description>The participant indicates level of agreement with 10 statements (1: strongly disagree - 5 strongly agree). Scores for each question are converted to a new number, added together and then multiplied by 2.5 to convert the original scores of 0-40 to 0-100. (From: https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/system-usability-scale.html) Higher scores indicate better usability.</description>

    <description>Participants engage in the use of a mobile neurofeedback intervention, which involves using a mobile app paired with an EEG headset, to achieve a calm, relaxed state. Participants will be instructed to use the intervention at a minimum of 10 minutes a day, 4 times a week for a total of 12 weeks.</description>

    <description>Neurofeedback intervention delivered via mobile app. Participants wear an EEG headset which is connected to a mobile app that delivers feedback about brainwave data indicating whether they are in a calm, relaxed state. Participants hear a lower/simple sound when they are below a target level and higher/richer sound when they approach or achieve their target.</description>
