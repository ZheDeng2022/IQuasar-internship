      All patients were investigated using a 3T MRI and 1,5 T MRI scanners. For myocardium,&#xD;
      pancreas and pituitary gland iron overload quantification in children we have used special&#xD;
      sequences for T2*-mapping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Miocardium, pancreas and pituitary gland T2* relaxometry maps were calculated automatically&#xD;
      by commertial application ReportCARD Functool (GE Healthcare) and integrated Philips T2*&#xD;
      maps. Then for selected ROI T2* data acquisition in milisecond [ms] were performed and&#xD;

    <textblock>
      All patients were investigated using a 3T MRI scanner (Philips Achieva) and 1,5 T MRI scanner&#xD;
      (GE Signa) with 8-channel surface coil for body scanning. For myocardium, pancreas and&#xD;
      pituitary gland iron overload quantification in children we have used special sequences for&#xD;
      T2*-mapping based on fast gradient echo sequences - multi-phase fast gradient echo and&#xD;
      ultrashort gradient echo (uTE) in axial and coronary plane. For breath-hold acquisition due&#xD;
      to failure of communication and invariable behavior some children received anaesthetic&#xD;
      support with mechanical ventilation. Miocardium, pancreas and pituitary gland T2* relaxometry&#xD;
      maps were calculated automatically by commertial application ReportCARD Functool (GE&#xD;
      Healthcare) and integrated Philips T2* maps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The placement of region of interest (ROI) in target organ were performed by following&#xD;
      criterion: for the myocardium - in the interventricular septum in short axis plane; for the&#xD;
      pancreas - in corpus in axial plane; for the pituitary gland - in adenohypophysis; for all&#xD;
      organs the area of large and small blood vessels, which can introduce distortions of the&#xD;
      obtained results were excluded. Then for selected ROI T2* data acquisition in milisecond [ms]&#xD;
      were performed and calculated automatically by approximating the attenuation curve with the&#xD;
      highest likelihood method.&#xD;
