  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research suggests older adults report wide-ranging emotional distress (e.g., symptoms of&#xD;
      anxiety, depression) that negatively impacts their physical and mental health, and is&#xD;
      associated with a reduction in daily activity. The overarching goal of this proposal is to&#xD;
      adapt an existing evidence-based intervention, the Unified Protocol for Transdiagnostic&#xD;
      Treatment of Emotional Disorders (UP), to increase activity in older adults by reducing&#xD;
      emotional distress. The primary aim of the proposed study is to adapt a 5-session version of&#xD;
      the UP for use with older adults reporting emotional distress and reduced engagement in daily&#xD;
      activities, and to also develop a self-guided version of this intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This aim will be accomplished in two phases. In Phase 1, patient will receive the UP as&#xD;
      written via telehealth. At the end of treatment they will provide feedback on the treatment,&#xD;
      including any suggested changes as well as provide suggestions for changing the treatment&#xD;
      that might allow an individual to successfully complete it on their own. This information&#xD;
      will be used to iteratively change the treatment and develop a self-guided version of the&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase 2, we will compare the therapist-delivered and self-guided version of treatment to&#xD;
      see if patients find them acceptable. In this phase, patients will be randomized to receive&#xD;
      one of these two treatments.&#xD;
