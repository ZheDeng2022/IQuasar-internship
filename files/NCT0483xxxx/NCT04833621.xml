    <textblock>
      Background: Sarcopenia (muscle weakness) characterized by a decrease in muscle mass, strength&#xD;
      and performance is a condition that increases with old age. Sarcopenia can be seen in 5-13%&#xD;
      of patients hospitalized in ICU where various treatment methods are used to prevent this&#xD;
      weakness, the rate increases in patients with sepsis/ septic shock. Muscle treatment methods&#xD;
      are used to prevent sarcopenia in similar patients hospitalized in ICU. It is predicted that&#xD;
      &quot;neuromuscular electrical stimulator-NMES&quot; treatment may increase muscle mass and strength in&#xD;
      patients who's can not be exercised actively. In this study, the contribution of NMES&#xD;
      treatment to prevent the development of muscle weakness in patients with a diagnosis of&#xD;
      sepsis/ septic shock followed in intensive care units (ICU) was evaluated.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Patients and methods: In our single-center, prospective clinical study, 80 patients with a&#xD;
      diagnosis of sepsis/ septic shock who were hospitalized in ICU were included. The effects of&#xD;
      NMES and muscle strengthening and standard physiotherapy exercises on the development of&#xD;
      ICU-AW were observed. The day when our patients were diagnosed with sepsis was recorded as&#xD;
      the first day of the study. Anthropometric and ultrasonographic measurements of bilateral&#xD;
      biceps brachii and bilateral rectus femoris muscles were recorded on the following days i.e.&#xD;
      3, 7, 14, 21, and 28. Sarcopenia was defined by anthropometric and ultrasonographic&#xD;
      measurement, and all patient outcome data were recorded.&#xD;

    <description>The measurements of the patients were recorded as anthropometric (arm circumference and thigh circumference) on the 1st, 3rd, 7th, 14th, 21st and 28th days. Arm circumference(centimeter) measurement was measured from the thickest part of the biceps muscle(centimeter) when the elbow was flexed and thigh circumference (centimeter) was measured anthropometrically with a tape measure (centimeter), 15 centimeter above the patella with the leg in extension.</description>

    <description>Using an ultrasound imaging device, the thickness of biceps brachii (cm^2) and rectus femoris muscles (cm^2) were measured ultrasonographically (at the same points of anthropometric measurements) with the linear probe.</description>

    <description>The height of the patients was calculated by measuring the knee height from many alternative height measurement methods. The measurement includes the length from the base of the foot to the anterior surface of the thigh while the lower extremity is flexed and is easily taken Chumlea et al. The equation created by the Chumlea method, known as the Chumlea method, is the most accurate equation used to estimate standing height from knee height. This method has been cross-validated for use in ICU patients. The original estimated equations are given.&#xD;
White Male Estimated height (cm) = (knee height (cm) × 1.88) + 71.85 White Female Estimated height (cm) = (knee height (cm) × 1.87) - (0.06 × age (y)) + 70.25</description>
