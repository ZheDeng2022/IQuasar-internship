    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to assess the effects of transmyringeal ventilation tubes&#xD;
      compared with sham-treatment which do not ventilate the middle ear, on the number of vertigo&#xD;
      attacks lasting more than 20 minutes in participants with Menière's disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Menière's disease is an inner ear disorder with recurrent attacks of vertigo, fluctuating&#xD;
      sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural fullness. The underlying pathogenetic&#xD;
      mechanisms are not known. The pathologic-anatomic correlate of the disease is endolymphatic&#xD;
      hydrops, i.e. distension of the endolymphatic spaces as seen at post-mortem microscopic&#xD;
      examination of the temporal bone. Prevalence-figures are in the range between 0.1% to 0.5% in&#xD;
      the population. In Denmark, the estimated prevalence of Menière's disease is 3500. The&#xD;
      disease commonly begins in the fourth or fifth decade of life, and the prevalence increases&#xD;
      with age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are a great number of different treatment options for Menière's disease including&#xD;
      diuretics, sodium-restriction, beta-histidine, and psycho-supportive means, most of which are&#xD;
      not validated. The only validated treatment for the vertigo attacks is chemical&#xD;
      labyrinthectomy by intra-tympanic injections of the ototoxic antibiotic gentamicin for which&#xD;
      two double-blind, placebo-controlled trials found a significant effect. Treatment with&#xD;
      gentamicin is ablative, i.e. the goal of the treatment is to destroy the vestibular sensors&#xD;
      of the affected ear. This carries a risk of long-standing unsteadiness alongside with&#xD;
      permanent hearing loss in the treated ear. Still, no treatments seem to protect from the&#xD;
      hearing loss associated with Menière's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first to advocate the use of transmyringeal ventilation tubes for Menière's disease was&#xD;
      Tumarkin in 1966. Tumarkin et al. suggested that negative middle-ear pressure, due to poor&#xD;
      tubal function, would lead to a relative over-pressure in the inner ear and that this might&#xD;
      be one of the mechanisms behind Menière's disease. In addition, Tumarkin et al. presented&#xD;
      several cases where treatment with transmyringeal tubes resulted in relief from vertigo&#xD;
      attacks. Hall and Brackmann performed tympanometry in patients with Menière's disease and&#xD;
      showed that some, but not all, patients had negative middle-ear pressure and they questioned&#xD;
      Tumarkin's suggestions.&#xD;

    <description>In both groups, the tympanic membrane will be anesthetized by local application of topical prilocaine (EMLA) or phenol or by infiltration anaesthesia of the outer ear canal. The choice of method is left to the discretion of the surgeon.&#xD;
For the experimental group, insertion of a ventilation tube will be performed. An incision is performed, usually in the lower, anterior quadrant of the tympanic membrane and the transmyringeal tube is inserted.</description>

    <description>For the control group, the ENT-specialist will touch the tympanic membrane with an alligator ear forceps to simulate getting a paracentesis. In the same procedure, without having made a paracentesis, a ventilation tube is placed on the tympanic membrane and removed again afterwards. The reason for the above-mentioned is to simulate getting a paracentesis and insertion of a ventilation tube.</description>
