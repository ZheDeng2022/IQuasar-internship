  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) eye surgery continues to be the most common refractive&#xD;
      procedure used to correct different forms of ametropia. Although the introduction of&#xD;
      femtosecond technology has markedly reduced the incidence of intraoperative flap&#xD;
      complications and allowed a better control on flap parameters, dry eye remains one of the&#xD;
      most challenging postoperative complications.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The pathophysiology of post LASIK dry eye is not clear; however, many mechanisms have been&#xD;
      suggested including inflammation, loss of conjunctival goblet cells during suction,&#xD;
      exacerbation of a preexisting dry eye, abnormal interaction between the lid margins and the&#xD;
      ocular surface. Intact corneal sensation is crucial for proper tear production and&#xD;
      distribution on the ocular surface as well as maintaining the normal dynamics of eyelid&#xD;
      blinking. Disruption of corneal nerves in LASIK decreases the release of neurotrophic factors&#xD;
      necessary for the normal function of the corneal epithelium as well as the integrity of the&#xD;
      lacrimal functional unit, a condition referred to as LASIK induced neurotrophic&#xD;
      epitheliopathy (LINE) that largely contributes to the development of post- LASIK dry eye .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many studies evaluated the incidence of post-refractive dry eye after LASIK compared to&#xD;
      flapless laser vision correction (LVC) procedures such as PRK and small incision lenticule&#xD;
      extraction (SMILE). The aim of this study is to assess and compare different dry eye&#xD;
      parameters following LASIK with planned thin flaps created by femtosecond laser (FS) and&#xD;
      mechanical microkeratome (MK).&#xD;

    <measure>Tear film break up time TBUT</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Fluorescein strip was inserted in the lower conjunctival fornix for few seconds then removed and the patient was asked to frequently blink, the stained tear film was observed with slit lamp (cobalt blue filter) till the appearance of the first black (dry) spot and the time interval in seconds was measured</description>

    <measure>Schirmer I test</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Whatman filter paper (35 mm long) was folded 5mm and inserted in the lower conjunctival fornix away from the cornea and the patient was asked to blink normally. After 5minutes the paper was removed, and the amount of wetting in millimeters was measured.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Ocular Surface Disease Index OSDI</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>A questionnaire consisting of 12 questions. Each question with a score from 0 to 4, the OSDI score is calculated by multiplying the sum by 25 and dividing by the number of questions answered. This yields a score from 0 to 100. The results of OSDI score can be graded as normal (0-12), mild dry eye (13-22), moderate dry eye (23-32), or severe dry eye (33-100)</description>

    <measure>Lower Tear meniscus height (LTMH)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Anterior segment Optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) examination was scheduled in the afternoon. The lower TMH was evaluated with a vertical scan centered on the inferior cornea and the lower eyelid. The lower TMH was measured with a special caliper tool incorporated in the device in micrometers and the height of the tear meniscus is the distance between 2 points ,one where the meniscus intersects the inferior cornea superiorly and the other where the meniscus intersects the lower eyelid margin inferiorly.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Lower Tear meniscus area (LTMA)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The lower TMA was evaluated using AS-OCT with a vertical scan centered on the inferior cornea and the lower eyelid then a built in software caliper tool was used to determine the borders of the tear meniscus and calculate the area (TMA) in millimeter square (mm2).</description>
