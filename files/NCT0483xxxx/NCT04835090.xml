  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The financial health care and social impact of the frailty of the elderly is an important&#xD;
      issue for preventive health care in various countries around the world. The Taiwan government&#xD;
      launched the long-term care 10-year plan version 2.0 in 2017 and expanded service target with&#xD;
      older people with frailty as a service need. There is no consensus on the definition of&#xD;
      frailty. However, there are many existing frailty screening instruments. It is very important&#xD;
      to choose accurate and simple and rapid tools for screening to reduce the extra medical costs&#xD;
      caused by negative outcomes of frailty. The primary purpose of this study is to understand&#xD;
      the transition changes of the elderly in the community during the six months of frail state&#xD;
      (robust, pre-frail, frail), and examine the validity of the frailty, physical function&#xD;
      (handgrip strength, walking speed) to predict negative outcomes (falls,&#xD;
      institutionalization/hospitalization), and will be compared with the results of three frailty&#xD;
      screening tools. The secondary purpose is to compare the feasibility (screening time,&#xD;
      screening completion rate, equipment and space) of the three tools for the frailty screening&#xD;
      of the elderly in the community.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective study with six month follow-up among community-dwelling elderly aged 65&#xD;
      or older. Agreement between instruments, Frail state transition changes, feasibility,&#xD;
      internal consistency, concurrent and predictive validity, convergent validity of instruments&#xD;
      will be evaluated and compared. The participants' recruitment strategies will be through&#xD;
      referrals by the personnel in outpatient department in a hospital, community care centers,&#xD;
      health centers, C tiers of community care service system, love angel stations etc. We focused&#xD;
      on three available instruments based on literature review and expert opinions for&#xD;
      community-dwelling elderly care: Kihon Checklist (KCL), Study of Osteoporotic Fractures&#xD;
      (SOF), and frailty phenotype (FP) screening tools. Using G-power3.1 for sample size&#xD;
      estimation, 80 subjects will be needed. Based on the estimated loss rate is 30%, so 110&#xD;
      participants need to be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The screening sequence of this research will carry out with the Randomization block. There&#xD;
      are six sequence combinations with three frailty screening tools. The researcher read the&#xD;
      questionnaire one by one item, and then will fill the participants' answers into the data&#xD;
      collection sheets. The physical function test is performed by the researcher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was approved by the institutional Review Board. All participants will be asked to&#xD;
      complete written informed consent. The statistical method adopts multivariate repeated&#xD;
      measure analysis to detect the transition of frailty state. The area under the curve (AUC)&#xD;
      will be used to examine the predictive ability on body function (grip strength, walking&#xD;
      speed) and negative outcomes (falls, hospitalization) of the three frailty screening tools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anticipated benefits of this study will include (1) clinical practice: provide the&#xD;
      screening time, completion rate, reliability and validity of the frailty screening tools to&#xD;
      clinical health care professionals with reference to the selection of frailty screening tools&#xD;
      for the community-dwelling elderly. Predicting the cut-off point of screening for falls or&#xD;
      institutionalization/hospitalization of elderly people in the community can be used in&#xD;
      nursing clinical practice to explain the screening results and risk assessment of falls and&#xD;
      hospitalization to patients to prevent or delay the frailty progress. (2) academic research:&#xD;
      provide a six-month observation of the changes in the frailty status of the elderly in the&#xD;
      community in Taiwan, increase the understanding of the frailty transition of the elderly in&#xD;
      the community, and identify frailty screening tools that have better prediction of physical&#xD;
      functions and negative results. (3) National development: The results of this study are&#xD;
      provided to the government as a reference for optimizing Taiwan's long-term care 2.0 policy&#xD;
      formulation.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Frailty Phenotype (FP)</measure>
    <time_frame>This will be measured at baseline, three months and six months.</time_frame>
    <description>The FP measurement tool consists five items (yes/no) which includes handgrip strength measured via a dynamometer (in kilograms), self-reported weight loss, self-reported exhaustion, 5 meter usual gait speed (in seconds), and physical activity level measured by the Taiwan International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form (Taiwanese version of the IPAQ), which was used to calculate calorie consumption. The number of criteria (a 6-level ordinal variable ranging from 0 to 5) is categorized into a 3-level variable depicting robust (none of the criteria), pre-frail (one or two criteria) and frail (three or more criteria).</description>

    <description>The SOF consists three items (yes/no) which includes weight loss (unintentional); inability to rise from a chair 5 times without the use of arms; and reduced energy level. Frail status was defined as robust (none of components), prefrail (one component), and frail (two or more components).</description>

    <measure>Change in Kihon Checklist (KCL)</measure>
