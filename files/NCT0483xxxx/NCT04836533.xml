      The purpose of this research study is to determine how treatment response may change&#xD;
      depending on how studies are designed, and if mobile cognitive training can be used to&#xD;
      improve treatment response in depressed older adults.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of disability, morbidity, and mortality&#xD;
      across the lifespan and poses a particularly severe public health problem in late life.&#xD;
      Late-life depression (LLD) is highly recurrent, can become chronic, and is often difficult to&#xD;
      treat. Antidepressant treatment is often ineffective in this population because of the&#xD;
      presence of neurocognitive factors including slow processing speed (PS), executive&#xD;
      dysfunction (ED), and cerebrovascular disease (CVD) that interfere with treatment. It is&#xD;
      crucial, therefore, that we develop interventions that address antidepressant non-response&#xD;
      and dramatically improve the quality of life of millions of vulnerable older adults. We&#xD;
      recently determined that an important cause of non-response in this population is impaired&#xD;
      expectancy effects, which in turn are compromised by slow speed of processing. We propose,&#xD;
      therefore, that antidepressant non-response in older adults with PS deficits is caused by&#xD;
      expectancy failure and that targeting PS deficits prior to antidepressant treatment will&#xD;
      restore the capacity to form expectations thereby improving antidepressant treatment&#xD;
      response. An excellent candidate for improving PS is computerized cognitive training (CCT),&#xD;
      i.e., exercises that target, train, and strengthen specific cognitive processes with the use&#xD;
      of structured drills and repeated practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test our expectancy-processing speed model, 100 depressed adults age 60 and over with PS&#xD;
      deficits will be recruited. Participants will be randomized to either CCT or control&#xD;
      (Solitaire) for 4 weeks. Both conditions will train 25 minutes per day, 7 days per week. At&#xD;
      the conclusion of this four-week period, patients will be randomly assigned to high versus&#xD;
      low expectancy treatment conditions. Patients assigned to the low expectancy condition will&#xD;
      be told they will receive either placebo or escitalopram when in fact they will receive&#xD;
      escitalopram for eight weeks. Patients assigned to the high expectancy condition will be told&#xD;
      they will receive escitalopram for eight weeks. Neuropsychological assessment will occur at&#xD;
      baseline and weeks 4 and 12 whereas MRI scans will be conducted at baseline and week 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical assessments will be conducted biweekly throughout the study. The goals of this study&#xD;
      are to 1) To determine whether PS mediates the relationship between CCT and expectancy, and&#xD;
      2) To compare endpoint depression scores as a function of CCT and expectancy conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the screening evaluation, informed consent for the screening evaluation is obtained.&#xD;
      Participants subsequently undergo a psychiatric clinical interview using the Structured&#xD;
      Clinical Interview Diagnostic for DSM-V (SCID-V), 24- item Hamilton Rating Scale for&#xD;
      Depression (HRSD), Clinical Global Impressions Scale - Severity (CGI-Severity), Cumulative&#xD;
      Illness Rating Scale for Geriatrics (CIRS-G) and Antidepressant Treatment History Form (ATHF)&#xD;
      to document depression diagnosis, severity, and medical comorbidity. WAIS-IV Digit Symbol&#xD;
      Coding will be completed to determine whether the patient meets inclusion criteria for PS (&gt;1&#xD;
      SD on age adjusted norms). If the patient is eligible for study entry, participation in the&#xD;
      research protocol will be discussed and informed consent will be obtained. After consent is&#xD;
      obtained, patients will receive a comprehensive baseline neuropsychological assessment and&#xD;
      MRI (structural, resting state, and DTI). Neuropsychological assessments include MMSE,&#xD;
      WAIS-IV Coding, NIH Toolbox Cognition Battery, NIH Supplement Auditory Verbal Learning Test&#xD;
      (Rey), Trail Making Test (Part A and B), Stroop Color-Word Test, and The Letter and Animal&#xD;
      Naming Test. These measures will capture global cognitive functioning, processing speed,&#xD;
      attention, and response inhibition, and verbal fluency. After testing, patients will be&#xD;
      randomized to either CCT or active control for 4 weeks (25'/day, 7 days/week). Patients&#xD;
      randomized to CCT will complete seven 25-minute sessions per week for 4 weeks using BrainHQ's&#xD;
      Double Decision in the experimental condition (a processing speed exercise) and BrainHQ&#xD;
      solitaire in the control condition. At the conclusion of this four-week period, patients will&#xD;
      complete a second neuropsychological assessment and a second fMRI (to determine change in&#xD;
      resting-state BOLD signal in the CCN). Patients will then be randomly assigned to high versus&#xD;
      low expectancy treatment conditions. Patients assigned to the low expectancy condition will&#xD;
      be told they will receive either placebo escitalopram when in fact they will receive&#xD;
      escitalopram for eight weeks. Patient assigned to the high expectancy condition will be told&#xD;
      and they will receive escitalopram for eight weeks. Expectancy is measured at baseline and&#xD;
      after informing patients of their randomization status. The difference between their pre and&#xD;
      post randomization expectancy regarding treatment improvement is the expectancy effect. At&#xD;
      the conclusion of the eight-week clinical trial, the difference in antidepressant response&#xD;
      observed between the open and placebo-controlled medication treatments is a measure of the&#xD;
      expectancy contribution to outcome. Neuropsychological assessment will occur again at the&#xD;
      conclusion of the escitalopram trial (week 12). Clinical assessments will be conducted&#xD;
      biweekly throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The novel experimental therapeutics approach taken in this proposal cuts across several&#xD;
      research themes (prevention and translation) and addresses many of the challenges (digital&#xD;
      technology and neural circuits) elaborated in NIMH's Strategic Plan for mental health&#xD;
      research in the 21st century. Consistent with NIMH goals, it also develops strategies for&#xD;
      tailoring existing interventions to optimize outcomes and elucidates the mechanism by which&#xD;
      antidepressant treatment in LLD can be restored.&#xD;
