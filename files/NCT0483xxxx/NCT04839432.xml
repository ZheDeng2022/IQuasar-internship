  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 2019, the investigators initiated a new priming fluid therapy strategy in the&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) machine for patients undergoing pulmonary endarterectomy&#xD;
      surgery. It consisted in a transition from a &quot;pure&quot; primarly balanced crystalloid priming&#xD;
      fluid strategy to a 4% human albumin priming fluid-strategy in addition to a low volume of&#xD;
      balanced crystalloid solution. The rationale was the theoritical assumption that albumin&#xD;
      leads to better intravascular volume expansion compared to crystalloid and therefore could&#xD;
      reduce overall volume requirement during surgery and consequently potentially decrease the&#xD;
      incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications. The objective of this propensity-matched&#xD;
      study was to evaluate the effectiveness of this intervention&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Intravenous fluid is usually needed (and sometime in important amount) to increase&#xD;
      intravascular volume during cardiac surgery and to prime the cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB)&#xD;
      circuit. In this context, albumin has been frequently used as the ideal fluid choice.&#xD;
      Although albumin has the disadvantage to be much more expensive than crystalloids and not to&#xD;
      be free from immunological reactions, this solution provides a more sustained volume effect&#xD;
      that a similar volume of crystalloid which may result in smaller volumes of resuscitation&#xD;
      fluid being administered. It also better preserves the on-bypass oncotic pressure and reduce&#xD;
      extravascular lung water. These considerations are important especially during pulmonary&#xD;
      thromboendarterectomy surgery (PTE), a high-risk procedure which aims to resect&#xD;
      thromboembolic material. Reperfusion lung injury (RLI) and/or acute respiratory distress&#xD;
      syndrome (ARDS), are the most encountered postoperative pulmonary complications and are&#xD;
      significant risks factors of morbi-mortality. As data suggest that RLI and ARDS are&#xD;
      high-permeability phenomenon, cautious is required to avoid fluid accumulation/overload&#xD;
      during this complex procedure. In addition, this surgical procedure has a relatively high CPB&#xD;
      duration which can induce a systemic inflammatory response syndrome, damage the endothelial&#xD;
      glycocalyx and vascular barrier where crystalloids may extravagates and accumulates in the&#xD;
      lungs. On the contrary, albumin solution used during the priming of CPB can favorably&#xD;
      preserve oncotic pressure, have a protective effect on endothelial glycocalyx and better&#xD;
      maintain vascular barrier competence, preventing interstitial edema and potential pulmonary&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In March 2019, the investigators initiated a new priming fluid policy strategy aiming at&#xD;
      replacing our traditional pure crystalloid fluid administration for an albumin one in order&#xD;
      to decrease the relatively high-rate of pulmonary complications observed in the investigators&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this propensity-matched study was to evaluate the effectiveness of this&#xD;
      intervention&#xD;
