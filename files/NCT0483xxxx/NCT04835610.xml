  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In pediatric surgical patients, the sensitivity of forehead and finger PVI monitoring was&#xD;
      similar for the prediction of fluid responsiveness, whereas the specificity of forehead&#xD;
      monitoring was higher. The use of forehead PVI probes in the fluid management of these&#xD;
      patients seemed to be appropriate because cephalic region was not affected by low perfusion&#xD;
      states.&#xD;

      he Plethysmographic Variability Index (PVI) can be measured with both finger and forehead&#xD;
      probes. Vasoconstriction may reduce the reliability of PVI measurements in pediatric surgical&#xD;
      patients prone to hypothermia. The vascular structure of the forehead area is resistant to&#xD;
      changes in vasomotor tonus. The aim of our study is to compare the efficacy of PVI values&#xD;
      measured at the finger and forehead areas to predict fluid responsiveness in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fifty pediatric patients with obtained parental consent and ethics committee approval&#xD;
      underwent elective minor surgery were included into the study. Basic monitoring, finger and&#xD;
      forehead perfusion index (PI) and PVI monitoring were applied. Hemodynamic parameters, PI,&#xD;
      PVI, cardiac output (CO) values were recorded. The 15% increase in CO with passive leg raise&#xD;
      (PLR) maneuver was estimated as fluid responsiveness. Two groups were created: Group R (fluid&#xD;
      responsive); Group NR (fluid nonresponsive). Mann-Whitney U, t, chi-square and ROC tests were&#xD;
      used in statistical evaluation.&#xD;
