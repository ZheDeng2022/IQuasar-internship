    <textblock>
      Haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) can expose patients to a transient but marked&#xD;
      immunosuppression, during which viral infections are an important cause of morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality. Adoptive transfer of virus-specific T cells is an attractive approach to restore&#xD;
      protective T-cell immunity in patients with refractory viral infections after allogeneic&#xD;
      HSCT. The aim of this Phase III trial is to confirm efficacy of this treatment in children&#xD;
      and adults.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For a growing number of patients suffering from various conditions as, e.g., haematological&#xD;
      malignancies or diverse genetic disorders, haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) or&#xD;
      bone marrow transplantation offer the only possible curative options. However, HSCT is&#xD;
      associated with three major risks: graft rejection, graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) and&#xD;
      opportunistic, mostly viral, infections or reactivations resulting from delayed immune&#xD;
      reconstitution. Delayed immune reconstitution, however, often is the direct result of the&#xD;
      severe pre-transplantation conditioning treatment and T-cell depletion of the transplant&#xD;
      necessary to fight the risks of graft rejection and GvHD. Therefore, the risk for&#xD;
      life-threatening opportunistic, mostly viral, infections is increased in post-transplantation&#xD;
      patients. The most common infections after HSCT are Cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus&#xD;
      (EBV) and Adenovirus (AdV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard treatment approach for viral infections/reactivations is chemotherapy which&#xD;
      shows limited efficacy and does not restore immunity. Therefore, effective new treatment&#xD;
      options are required for this condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous investigations have shown that sufficient T-cell immunity is essential for the&#xD;
      control and prevention of viral reactivations and newly occurring infections after HSCT. The&#xD;
      infusion of T-cells is therefore a promising new approach to treat immune-comprised patients.&#xD;
      However, infusion with unselected T cells is associated with an increased risk for GvHD due&#xD;
      to the high content of alloreactive T cells. A very promising approach to minimize this&#xD;
      problem is to remove alloreactive T cells and enrich, isolate and purify virus-specific T&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This approach has been studied for nearly two decades and the data published up to date&#xD;
      indicate that virus-specific T-cell responses after adoptive T-cell transfer protect against&#xD;
      virus-related complications post HSCT and restore T-cell immunity, in particular for AdV-,&#xD;
      CMV- and EBV-infections. Despite these promising results, virus-specific T-cell transfer is&#xD;
      not yet translated into daily clinical practice due to the lack of prospective clinical&#xD;
      trials confirming the efficacy of this treatment approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall goal of this Phase III, double-blind placebo-controlled study is to test efficacy&#xD;
      of multivirus-specific T cells to bring this treatment method in clinical routine.&#xD;
      Multivirus-specific T cells generated in this study will be directed against all three most&#xD;
      common post-HSCT viral infections: AdV, CMV and EBV. Thus, T-cell immunity will be restored&#xD;
      to fight and prevent new viral infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After an initial screening visit, patients eligible to participate in the study will be&#xD;
      treated within 28 days after screening. Patients will be randomized in a 2:1 (treatment:&#xD;
      placebo) ratio and receive a single infusion with either multivirus-specific T cells or&#xD;
      placebo. Patients will be followed up on the day of treatment, 1 day after and 1, 2, 4, 8 and&#xD;
      15 weeks after treatment. Treatment success will be measured by assessing different&#xD;
      parameters including symptoms, quality of life, viral load and T-cell immunity in blood&#xD;
      samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients eligible to participate in this study are adult and paediatric patients who have&#xD;
      received allogeneic stem cell transplantation and suffer from new or reactivated EBV, AdV or&#xD;
      CMV infection refractory to standard antiviral treatment for two weeks. Patients from the six&#xD;
      European countries Germany, Belgium, Netherlands, UK, France and Italy will be enrolled. In&#xD;
      total 130 patients plus 19 screening failures are expected to participate in the study.&#xD;
