    <textblock>
      The DIETAPYR2 study is a randomized controlled crossover trial consisting of two experimental&#xD;
      periods each lasting 8 weeks. Enrolled participants were randomly assigned to either a&#xD;
      Pyrenean beef-based diet or a conventional chicken-based diet and instructed to consume this&#xD;
      meat three times a week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first visit the medical history was obtained and anthropometric measurements, blood&#xD;
      pressure (systolic and diastolic) and heart rate were taken. The day after the first visit,&#xD;
      in the morning, a sample of blood, stool and urine was taken from the participants after an&#xD;
      overnight fast. At the time of this visit (period 1), each participant was randomly assigned&#xD;
      to a Pyrenean beef diet (intervention group) or a conventional chicken-based diet (control&#xD;
      group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After an experimental period of 8 weeks, the participants were invited to carry out the same&#xD;
      evaluations as during the first visit. Subsequently, a 5-week washout period was carried out&#xD;
      to eliminate the possible residual effects of the first experimental period. After the&#xD;
      washout period, the participants were called back for the same assessments during a third&#xD;
      visit just before the second experimental period (period 2). During this period, those who&#xD;
      were previously on a Pyrenean beef diet (intervention group) were crossed with the&#xD;
      conventional chicken diet (control group) and vice versa. Finally, after the second 8-week&#xD;
      experimental period, the participants were retested as on previous visits.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current study is a sub-study included in the DIETAPYR2 study (Innovations applied to the&#xD;
      Pyrenean beef production to enhance consumer-identifiable meat), a randomized-controlled&#xD;
      crossover trial consisting of two experimental periods with a duration of 8 weeks each.&#xD;
      Enrolled participants were randomly assigned whether to a Pyrenean beef-based diet or to a&#xD;
      Conventional chicken-based diet and were instructed to consume this meat three times per&#xD;
      week. The Pyrenean beef is meat from young calves of native breeds, raised mainly on local&#xD;
      pastures with a recognized impact in environmental and social sustainability of this rural&#xD;
      geographical area. The Pyrenees (mountain range between France and Spain) is an optimal place&#xD;
      for the practice of extensive livestock rearing given the richness of forages and the&#xD;
      existence of native cow breeds that make use of these natural feedstuffs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To ensure harmonization in the study, each chef of the 3 selected student accommodation halls&#xD;
      was provided with instructions on the cooking methods for chicken and beef and they also&#xD;
      received examples of recipes. Cooking methods were breaded, stewed and grilled for beef and&#xD;
      breaded, stewed and roasted for chicken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the 2 weeks before the first period, researchers contacted with participants and&#xD;
      obtained informed consent from them. Then, the first visit was scheduled where the medical&#xD;
      history was obtained and the anthropometric measurements, blood pressure (systolic and&#xD;
      diastolic) and heart rate measures were undertaken. The day after the first visit, in the&#xD;
      morning, a blood, stool and urine sample was collected from participants after an overnight&#xD;
      fast. At the time of this visit (period 1), each participant was randomly assigned to&#xD;
      Pyrenees beef diet (intervention group) or a conventional chicken-based diet (control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following an 8-week experimental period, participants were invited to perform the same&#xD;
      assessments as during the first visit. Afterwards, a 5-week washout period took place to&#xD;
      remove the possible residual effects of the first experimental period. Participants were&#xD;
      requested not to change their diet or physical activity habits for the 5-week washout period.&#xD;
      After the washout period, participants were called again to perform the same assessments&#xD;
      during a 3rd visit right before the second experimental period (period 2). During this period&#xD;
      those previously on Pyrenees beef diet (intervention group) were crossed to conventional&#xD;
      chicken diet (control group) and vice versa. Finally, after the 8 week second experimental&#xD;
      period, participants were assessed again as in previous visits.&#xD;
