  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thrombocytopenia is an important pathological feature of HFRS（Hemorrhagic Fever With Renal&#xD;
      Syndrome, HFRS）. However, the cause of thrombocytopenia in HFRS is not yet fully understood.&#xD;
      Neutrophils, as the largest number of white blood cells in the human body, can widely&#xD;
      participate in the immune process of viral infections. Previous studies have found that the&#xD;
      neutrophils of patients with acute myocardial infarction can interact with activated&#xD;
      platelets and further mediate platelet phagocytosis.Therefore, this study aims to&#xD;
      systematically elucidate the immunological process of neutrophil mediated thrombocytopenia in&#xD;
      patients with HFRS by exploring the correlation between platelet activation, neutrophil&#xD;
      activation and neutrophil proportion of adherent / phagocytic platelets peripheral blood of&#xD;
      HFRS patients, and to analyze its relationship with the course of HFRS disease, which lays a&#xD;
      theoretical foundation for further understanding the pathogenesis of HFRS and provides a&#xD;
      basis for clinical use.&#xD;

        This project intends to collect about 160 inpatients (the First Affiliated Hospital of&#xD;
        Xi'an Jiaotong University) who were diagnosed with HFRS between 2021.01-2023.06 for&#xD;
        follow-up research, including about 40 cases of light, medium, severe, and critical. 40&#xD;
        healthy people served as normal controls.&#xD;
