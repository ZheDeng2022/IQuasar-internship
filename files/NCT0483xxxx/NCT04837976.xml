  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's Disease (PD) has generally been thought of as a movement disorder however other&#xD;
      health-related symptoms, known as non-motor symptoms, are also very common. Non-motor&#xD;
      symptoms can be very broad and present in numerous conditions, making identifying the&#xD;
      symptoms of early-stage Parkinson's disease very difficult. Non-motor symptoms, including&#xD;
      fatigue, and problems with sleep and mood, can happen decades before motor symptoms and have&#xD;
      a greater impact on quality of life and psychological wellbeing. Despite this treatment&#xD;
      options for non-motor symptoms are limited and therefore the development and testing of new&#xD;
      treatments is a main priority.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the limited treatments options available, self-management of symptoms through positive&#xD;
      lifestyle changes is a warranted area of research. The perspectives amongst patients,&#xD;
      caregivers, and HCP's regarding lifestyle behavior change and its impact on fatigue and&#xD;
      related non-motor symptoms has yet to be investigated in detail. This study includes two&#xD;
      stages: telephone interviews and online consensus workshops. Patients with PD whom have&#xD;
      experience of fatigue, partners/caregivers and Healthcare professionals will be able to&#xD;
      participate in interviews only, workshops only or both. The interviews will investigate&#xD;
      patients, partners/caregivers and Healthcare Professionals views and priorities of lifestyle&#xD;
      factors in the management of non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease as well as identifying&#xD;
      factors that influence lifestyle changes amongst PD patients. Stage 2 will involve small&#xD;
      consensus workshops to generate ideas and feedback related to the design and content of the&#xD;
      soon-to be developed lifestyle program. Results from both stages of this study will be used&#xD;
      to help develop and design a lifestyle management program for fatigue and associated&#xD;
      non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's Disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Global aim: To assess stakeholders (patients, supportive individuals, and HCP's) views and&#xD;
      priorities of lifestyle factors in the management of fatigue and related non-motor symptoms&#xD;
      in Parkinson's disease, in addition to identifying facilitators and barriers to&#xD;
      lifestyle-related behavior change, in order to inform the development of a subsequent&#xD;
      lifestyle intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of two stages:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Semi-structured interviews (lasting around 60 minutes)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Online consensus workshops using a nominal group technique (2x 60 minute sessions)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting: Both stages will be conducted remotely. For Stage 1 interviews will be conducted&#xD;
      over the telephone (with or without videoconferencing). Stage 2 will use an online&#xD;
      brainstorming platform to run the consensus workshop with concurrent videoconferencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: For both stages' participants will include individuals with Parkinson's&#xD;
      Disease, supportive individual's (partners/caregivers/family members/significant others) and&#xD;
      healthcare professionals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1- Interviews will be analyzed using thematic analysis and framework mapping onto the&#xD;
      COM-B model. Themes will be deductively mapped onto the categories and its associated&#xD;
      constructs of the Capability, Opportunity and Motivation to Behaviour (COM-B) model to&#xD;
      identify specific targetable aspects of behavior that may need to be addressed in the&#xD;
      subsequent lifestyle intervention. A secondary categorical form narrative analysis of the&#xD;
      interviews will also be conducted to supplement the main group analysis by providing a&#xD;
      detailed insight into the experiences and stories of participants in relation to lifestyle&#xD;
      changes on an individual level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2- Responses during the consensus workshop will be analyzed using frequency counts and&#xD;
      descriptive. Data will include a complete list of ideas, scores allocated to each idea, the&#xD;
      overall rank of each idea and any additional comments made by participants.&#xD;
