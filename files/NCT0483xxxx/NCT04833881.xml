  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pregnancy-induced hypertension is a unique abnormal blood pressure disease in women during&#xD;
      pregnancy, including eclampsia, preeclampsia, pregnancy-induced hypertension, chronic&#xD;
      hypertension and so on. Eclampsia can lead to convulsions, proteinuria, multiple organ&#xD;
      failure, and eventually death. It is a very serious disease in women, and the incidence of&#xD;
      pregnancy-induced hypertension during pregnancy is between 4% and 10%. The incidence of&#xD;
      eclampsia ranges from 2% to 5%. Studies have shown that there are about 60,000 cases of&#xD;
      stillbirth or stillbirth due to eclampsia every year worldwide. At present, there are many&#xD;
      theories about the pathogenesis of eclampsia, such as oxidative stress theory, maternal and&#xD;
      fetal interaction theory, immune imbalance theory, heredity theory and so on.&#xD;

    <description>Proteomics analysis is carried out using the TMT labeling quantitative method, the significantly differentially expressed proteins and modification sites are screened out, and then the proteins with significantly different changes are used as disease signs; Through the GO classification analysis of the protein, the subcellular structure location analysis of the protein is carried out, and the mitochondrial-related protein and skeleton protein are concerned. Through the enrichment of acetylated antibody modified protein-peptide, the changes of modified protein and its regulatory mechanism were analyzed, and the regulatory role of acetylated protein in mitochondrial metabolism and immune response was found. This study uses the Mfuzz clustering method to perform clustering analysis of the expression profile of proteins, the pathogenesis of the disease through protein enrichment analysis, pathway analysis, and interaction analysis are explored.</description>
