  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative antibiotics are routinely used for implant-based breast augmentation at the&#xD;
      investigators' institution. From 2017-2019, the investigators' institution has conducted&#xD;
      approximately 270 primary and secondary breast augmentation procedures. Current plastic&#xD;
      surgery literature does not provide recommendations for antibiotic prophylaxis following&#xD;
      implant-based breast procedures. Despite controversy surrounding their utility during the&#xD;
      postoperative course, postoperative antibiotics have become commonplace for many plastic&#xD;
      surgeons. To date, strong scientific evidence supporting this practice is minimal and based&#xD;
      largely on anecdotal evidence and limited studies, including poorly controlled retrospective&#xD;
      and non-blinded prospective series. The goal of this study is to conduct a prospective&#xD;
      randomized trial to assess whether extended antibiotic prophylaxis is necessary to prevent&#xD;
      infection and long-term complications (e.g. capsular contracture) in patients undergoing&#xD;
      augmentation mammoplasty with implants. The investigators' anticipate that extended&#xD;
      antibiotic prophylaxis is not required. The rationale for discontinuing postoperative&#xD;
      antibiotics is based on the following: (1) a single dose of preoperative intravenous&#xD;
      antibiotics has been demonstrated to be sufficient prophylaxis for most breast surgeries and&#xD;
      (2) there are patient safety concerns associated with prolonged antimicrobial use such as the&#xD;
      development of resistant bacterial strains and clostridium-related infections. Concrete&#xD;
      evidence that extended antibiotic prophylaxis is not required would encourage plastic&#xD;
      surgeons to practice better antibiotic stewardship and help stymie the rise of drug-resistant&#xD;
      organisms.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The investigators will perform a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial at&#xD;
      University of California Los Angeles Ronald Reagan Medical Center for patients undergoing&#xD;
      primary and secondary breast augmentation between 2021-2025. The study will be added to a&#xD;
      research registry before patient enrollment begins (i.e. www.clinicaltrials.gov) with study&#xD;
      methods and results presented in the manner recommended by the CONSORT statement (available&#xD;
      at www.consort-statement.org). The study will be designed as a non-inferiority trial with two&#xD;
      parallel groups: the experimental group will receive an intraoperative dose of antibiotics&#xD;
      followed by oral antibiotics for 5 days postoperatively (Cephalexin 500 mg four times per day&#xD;
      or Clindamycin 300 mg four times per day, if Penicillin allergic) while the control group&#xD;
      will receive an intraoperative dose of antibiotics (Cefazolin 1 g or 2 g, or Clindamycin 600&#xD;
      mg or 900 mg, if Penicillin allergic, higher doses provided if BMI &gt; 30 kg/m2) followed by a&#xD;
      placebo for 5 days postoperatively. Inclusion criteria will include: females and transgender&#xD;
      females 18 years or older, patients undergoing primary breast augmentation, breast&#xD;
      augmentation-mastopexy, and secondary breast augmentation with subglandular or submuscular&#xD;
      implants. Secondary breast augmentation will include patients undergoing implant exchange&#xD;
      secondary to capsular contracture and implant rupture. Exclusion criteria will include&#xD;
      refusal or inability to consent, patients with biopsy-proven breast cancer, patients&#xD;
      undergoing expander-based and autologous flap breast reconstruction following mastectomies,&#xD;
      history of chest radiation, and the presence of active infection at the time of surgery.&#xD;
      Patients who fail to take the placebos or antibiotics provided in the study for any reason,&#xD;
      miss postoperative visits, and/or withdraw consent at any stage of the study will also be&#xD;
      excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the analysis, the investigators plan to obtain hospital records with intraoperative&#xD;
      procedural and postoperative clinic notes. Demographic information including gender, body&#xD;
      mass index, comorbidities, smoking use, and prior breast surgeries will be collected and used&#xD;
      for analysis. Power analysis for statistical equivalency using 8% infection rate yields a&#xD;
      required sample size of 164 total patients, with planned 82 patients per group (i.e.&#xD;
      experimental and control). This would provide 80 percent power at a significance level of 5&#xD;
      percent. The experimental group will consist of patients who receive an intraoperative dose&#xD;
      of antibiotics followed by oral antibiotics for 5 days postoperatively. The control group&#xD;
      includes patients who receive an intraoperative dose of antibiotics followed by a placebo for&#xD;
      5 days postoperatively. All medications and placebos will be formulated, compounded and&#xD;
      dispensed by the University of California Los Angeles Investigational Research Pharmacy. An&#xD;
      appointed Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will monitor data and safety as recommended&#xD;
      by the Investigational Review Board (IRB).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antibiotics of choice include intravenous Cefazolin and oral Cephalexin. Intravenous and oral&#xD;
      Clindamycin will be made available for subjects who are allergic to Penicillin. Subject&#xD;
      allocation will be based on a 1:1 ratio for each group. Surgeons, nursing, and administrative&#xD;
      staff will be responsible for recruitment. Prior to surgery, patients will be given a consent&#xD;
      form to explain their involvement in the randomized trial. The consent process will inform&#xD;
      the participant about details of the study and indicate participation is voluntary. They will&#xD;
      also be given the risks, benefits, alternatives, and confidentiality of their information&#xD;
      with proceeding with the study. Risks discussed with participants will include those&#xD;
      associated with antibiotic use, including gastrointestinal symptoms, yeast infections,&#xD;
      allergic reactions, development of resistant bacterial strains, and clostridium-related&#xD;
      infections. Potential risks associated with no antibiotic use (i.e. placebo group), include&#xD;
      infection. The interventions to protect those affected by these risks include hospital&#xD;
      admission as detailed in the informed consent under the section &quot;Office of the Human Research&#xD;
      Protection Program (OHRPP),&quot; and the option to opt out of the study. There are no medical&#xD;
      benefits with participating in the study. However, participants will be informed that the&#xD;
      results may contribute to the body of knowledge around postoperative antibiotics, and improve&#xD;
      surgical protocols and postoperative care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be performed prior to surgery, and an assigned study coordinator will&#xD;
      generate group assignments. Patients and surgeons will be blinded to the study before&#xD;
      randomization takes place. However, surgeons will have access to information following&#xD;
      medication dispensation in case any complications arise so that the provider can carry out&#xD;
      appropriate interventions. Review of the rate of subject accrual and compliance will occur&#xD;
      monthly during the recruitment phase. An interim analysis will be performed on the primary&#xD;
      endpoint when 50% of patients have been randomized and have complete their 6-month follow up&#xD;
      period. An independent statistician blinded to treatment allocation will perform the&#xD;
      analyses. The statistician will report to DSMB who will have unmasked access to all data.&#xD;
      Interim analysis will be used to inform stopping guidelines and trial adaptations (e.g.&#xD;
      sample size re-estimation, alteration to the proportion of participants allocated to each&#xD;
      study group, and changes to eligibility criteria). The Principal Investigator (PI) will be&#xD;
      responsible for ensuring participants' safety on a daily basis. The DSMB will act in an&#xD;
      advisory capacity to monitor participant safety, evaluate the progress of the study, and&#xD;
      review procedures for maintaining the confidentiality, quality, management, and analysis of&#xD;
      the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An adverse event will be any untoward medical occurrence in a subject without regard to the&#xD;
      possibility of a causal relationship. Adverse events will be collected after the subject has&#xD;
      provided consent and enrolled in the study. All adverse events occurring after entry into the&#xD;
      study and up to their first postoperative visit will be recorded. A serious adverse event for&#xD;
      this study is any untoward medical occurrence that is believed by the investigators to be&#xD;
      causally related to study-drug and results in any of the following: life-threatening&#xD;
      condition (i.e. immediate risk of death); severe or permanent disability, prolonged&#xD;
      hospitalization, or a significant hazard as determined by the DSMB. Investigators will&#xD;
      determine relatedness of an event to study based on a temporal relationship, as well as&#xD;
      whether the event is unexpected or unexplained given the subject's clinical course, previous&#xD;
      medical conditions, and concomitant medications. All adverse and severe events related to&#xD;
      antibiotic use, including anaphylaxis requiring hospital admission and/or resulting in death,&#xD;
      will be monitored through patient examination and chart review. Furthermore, events that meet&#xD;
      criteria for an adverse and serious adverse will be reported to the IRB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six plastic surgeons will be involved in the study and will utilize a standardized surgical&#xD;
      protocol. Initial follow up visits will be arranged within 1-2 weeks following surgery. Data&#xD;
      on adherence to the treatment protocol will be collected monthly by research staff and&#xD;
      reviewed quarterly by the Principal Investigator and the study statistician. Adherence of&#xD;
      participants will be evaluated by inquiring about completion of antibiotics or placebos at&#xD;
      each postoperative visit. During follow-up visits, inquiry will be made to assure patients&#xD;
      receive their antibiotics or placebos. This information along with any post-operative&#xD;
      complications will be transferred onto the patient's electronic medical record accordingly.&#xD;
      Primary outcomes including surgical site infection, secondary outcomes (e.g. hematoma,&#xD;
      seroma, wound dehiscence, implant loss, and capsular contracture), and antibiotic-related&#xD;
      complications (e.g. antibiotic resistance, diarrhea, clostridium infection, yeast infections,&#xD;
      rash, urinary tract infections, and gastrointestinal upset) will be documented. Surgical site&#xD;
      infections will be determined by the surgeon however will be defined by the presence of the&#xD;
      following signs and symptoms: fevers, purulent drainage, pain, tenderness, localized edema,&#xD;
      heat, erythema, positive wound cultures, and leukocytosis. Study endpoints will include&#xD;
      diagnosis of surgical site infection, development of secondary outcomes, and subject death or&#xD;
      loss to follow-up. Follow-up will be continued until all patients have reached one of the&#xD;
      study endpoints. Statistical tests will be performed by a statistician using statistical&#xD;
      software and determined after enough data has been generated to perform preliminary analysis.&#xD;
      Threats to study validity include under recruitment of subjects, subjects lost to follow-up,&#xD;
      subject non-compliance, and subject crossovers. This study will be stopped prior to its&#xD;
      completion if: the intervention is associated with adverse effects that call into question&#xD;
      the safety of the intervention; difficulty in study recruitment or retention will&#xD;
      significantly impact the ability to evaluate the study endpoints; any new information becomes&#xD;
      available during the trial that necessitates stopping the trial; or other situations occur&#xD;
      that might warrant stopping the trial.&#xD;
