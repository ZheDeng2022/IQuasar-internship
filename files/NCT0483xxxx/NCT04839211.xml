  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the potential effects of inspiratory muscle training&#xD;
      on cardiovascular, respiratory, physical, and psychosocial functions in patients with heart&#xD;
      failure.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure is a syndrome that leads to decreased cardiac output, inflammation, increased&#xD;
      catabolism, and prolonged immobilization, causing inspiratory muscle weakness. Cardiac&#xD;
      rehabilitation is a well-known treatment approach in heart failure however, the participation&#xD;
      rate in cardiac rehabilitation is low. Therefore, inspiratory muscle training may serve as an&#xD;
      alternative approach in patients with heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomly allocated into the inspiratory muscle training group and control&#xD;
      group. The inspiratory muscle training (IMT) group will carry out IMT sessions three days per&#xD;
      week for 8 weeks by using an inspiratory threshold loading device. Each session will consist&#xD;
      of seven cycles including 2 min of breathing on an inspiratory loading device followed by 1&#xD;
      min of rest and will last 21 min. IMT will be performed at the tolerable maximum load for&#xD;
      each 2-min work interval and will be progressively increased over the 8 weeks. The control&#xD;
      group will perform unloaded IMT by using an inspiratory threshold loading device during all&#xD;
      training sessions. Data will be collected before and after the treatment by a masked outcome&#xD;
      assessor.&#xD;
