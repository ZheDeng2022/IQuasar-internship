      To compare cardiorespiratory fitness parameters (oxygen consumption and respiratory&#xD;
      ventilation) measured during two sub-maximal exercise tests (six minute step test, 6MST &amp; six&#xD;
      minute walk test, 6 MWT) with maximal exercise test (cardiopulmonary exercise test, CPET)&#xD;

      After enrollment, the subjects will complete each of the following CRF assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-maximal exercise test Six Minute Step Test (6MST): A face mask with the VO2 Master&#xD;
      expired gas analysis device will be secured in position with head strap. Subjects will rest&#xD;
      seated for 5 minutes prior to the start of the test. The subject will be given a standardized&#xD;
      set of instructions on how to complete the test by raising each knee to 90 degrees of hip&#xD;
      flexion. The total number of steps completed during the timed 6-minute period will be&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-maximal exercise test Six Minute Walk Test (6MWT): A face mask with the VO2 Master&#xD;
      expired gas analysis device will be secured in position with head strap. Subjects will rest&#xD;
      seated for 5 minutes prior to the start of the test. A 30-m unobstructed hallway with turning&#xD;
      points marked with small cones will be used. The subject will be given a standardized set of&#xD;
      instructions on how to complete the test. The total distance walked during the timed 6-minute&#xD;
      period will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maximal exercise cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET): The CPET is performed using an&#xD;
      electromagnetically-braked cycle ergometer, 12-lead continuous ECG, continuous pulse&#xD;
      oximetry, continuous expired gas analysis (oxygen and carbon dioxide) with ventilation&#xD;
      [termed 'metabolic cart'] and intermittent non-invasive blood pressure measurement every 2&#xD;
      minutes. Once the subject is seated comfortably on the bike and adjusted for optimum cycling&#xD;
      position, the face mask is fitted. The subjects are instructed on how to perform the&#xD;
      incremental ramp test, starting with a baseline rest phase (no leg turnover) for 2 mins&#xD;
      followed by reference phase of 2 mins of leg turnover with no resistance (0 watts). The&#xD;
      incremental rise in work-rate from baseline is pre-determined by using the equation derived&#xD;
      by Wasserman and colleagues in which the same work-rate is increased throughout the test to&#xD;
      the limit of tolerance. A work-rate is selected by study staff to aim for a test duration of&#xD;
      between 8 and 12 minutes. The subjects are instructed to maintain a cycling cadence of 55 -&#xD;
      65 revolutions per minute (rpm) during the exercise phase. One the limit of tolerance&#xD;
      (maximal watts) is reached the resistance on the bike is removed () watts) and the subjects&#xD;
      are encouraged to continue cycling for a further 2 mins during the recovery phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The order in which 6MST and 6MWT are performed will be randomized. Between test the subjects&#xD;
      will be allowed to rest in a chair until the heart rate is within 5 beats per min of resting&#xD;
      values and blood pressure in within 10 mmHg of resting values. The CPET will be conducted&#xD;
      once both 6MWT and 6MST have been completed. If the subject expresses fatigue after either&#xD;
      6MWT and 6MST, then the subject may elect to re-attend on a separate day to complete the&#xD;
      evaluation. At completion of exercise evaluations the subjects will be discharged from study&#xD;
      participation. No further follow up will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 40 subjects aged 18 or older will be enrolled.&#xD;
