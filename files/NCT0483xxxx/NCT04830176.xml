    <textblock>
      The clinical cross over study involves the use of two herbal based dentifirices moringa and&#xD;
      miswak and its efficacy in reducing plaque induced gingivitis. The patients selected are&#xD;
      provided with details regarding the research format and consent taken.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The clinical cross over study involves use of miswak and moringa dentifrices. The patients&#xD;
      selected are 30 in no and are selected based on having gingival inflammation due to plaque&#xD;
      accumulation. All other cases related to gingival inflammation along with patients with&#xD;
      underlying systemic disease are excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline, plaque and gingival scores are recorded, followed by giving one of the&#xD;
      dentifrice to the patient for brushing. The patients are asked to brush twice a day and asked&#xD;
      to report after 72 hrs, following which another recording of plaque and gingival scores are&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients are then asked to use their own tooth paste for a period of 2 weeks as a wash&#xD;
      out period and recalled after this 2 week interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients are then given the second dentifrice and asked to brush for 72 hrs and then&#xD;
      asked to report again for a plaque and gingival score evaluation.&#xD;
