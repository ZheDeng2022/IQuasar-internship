      Objective: This randomized, controlled clinical study aimed to evaluate the performance of&#xD;
      one universal adhesive applied with etch-and-rinse or self-etch strategy and one&#xD;
      etch-and-rinse adhesive on fissure sealant retention over 24 months. Methodology: 144&#xD;
      sealants were placed on the permanent premolars and molars of 13 subjects. Teeth were divided&#xD;
      into three groups SB2(control): Adper Single Bond 2, SBU-ER: Single Bond&#xD;
      Universal/etch-and-rinse, SBU-SE: Single Bond Universal/self-etch. After the adhesive&#xD;
      application, Fissurit FX was applied and light-cured. Clinical evaluations were done at&#xD;
      baseline and at 1 week, 6-, 12-, 18- and 24-month recalls. Visual examination was performed&#xD;
      on every visit for evaluation of the sealants. Evaluating criteria were: 1= completely&#xD;
      retained; 2= partial loss; 3= total loss. The Pearson Chi-square test was used for each&#xD;
      evaluation period.&#xD;

      Thirteen patients with a mean age of 20.5 (range 19-22) were selected among the patients&#xD;
      seeking routine dental care from Conservative Dentistry Department who met the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria. Inclusion criteria were: good oral hygiene and and the absence of caries,&#xD;
      previously placed restorations, bruxism and an allergy to the materials tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bitewing radiographs were taken. Pellicle and any remaining plaque on the fissures were&#xD;
      removed by using slurry of pumice with a slow-speed handpiece. All restorative procedures&#xD;
      were performed by the same operator. The teeth were assigned for different group by using a&#xD;
      table of random numbers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 (SB2): Etched with 35% phosphoric acid gel for 30 s, rinsed and dried. Adper Single&#xD;
      Bond 2 (3M ESPE St. Paul MN. USA) applied and light cured for 10s with a LED device (Demi&#xD;
      Plus; Kerr, Switzerland) Group 2 (SBU-ER) : Etched with 35% phosphoric acid gel for 30s,&#xD;
      rinsed and dried. Single Bond Universal Adhesive (3M ESPE St. Paul MN.USA) applied, gently&#xD;
      air thinned for 5 s and light cured for 10s with a LED device Group 3 (SBU-SE): Single Bond&#xD;
      Universal Adhesive (3M ESPE St. Paul MN.USA) applied for 20 s with vigorous agitation, gently&#xD;
      air thinned for 5 s and light cured for 10 s with a LED device A nanofilled fissure sealant,&#xD;
      Fissurit FX (Voco,Cuxhaven,Germany) was applied to the fissures and air entrapment was&#xD;
      prevented by carefull spreading with a dental probe. The sealant material was light-cured for&#xD;
      20 seconds with LED. The occlusion was checked with articulating paper. Fine-grit diamond&#xD;
      burs (Diatech, Swiss Dental, Switzerland) and rubber cups (Edenta AG, AU SG, Switzerland).&#xD;
      were used for finishing and polishing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each restoration was evaluated at baseline,1week after treatment and 6, 12, 18 and 24 months.&#xD;
      Evaluation of restorations was carried out by two calibrated examiners who were unaware of&#xD;
      group allocation and who were not involved with the treatment procedures, by the help of a&#xD;
      mirror, blunt explorer and air stream. Caries formation was evaluated as present or absent&#xD;
      and the sealants were evaluated according to the following criteria: 1= Completely retained&#xD;
      2= Partial loss 3= Total loss.&#xD;
