  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, an estimated 3.9 million Malaysians continue to live with diabetes with many more&#xD;
      who live with prediabetes. Diabetes was the one of the leading causes of death in the&#xD;
      Malaysia and the leading cause for kidney failure, lower-limb amputations, and adult-onset&#xD;
      blindness. Heart disease and stroke are two to four times more likely for individuals with&#xD;
      diabetes. The use of mHealth or mobile health application can reduce blood sugar among&#xD;
      individuals with prediabetes but also prevent a later occurrence of diabetes. In this study,&#xD;
      the investigators aim to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of a digital health supported&#xD;
      pre-diabetes management program based in an urban community pharmacy setting&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pre-diabetes is an intermediate state of hyperglycaemia with glycaemic parameters above&#xD;
      normal but below the type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) threshold. It was estimated that &gt;25% of&#xD;
      individuals who are pre-diabetic convert to T2DM within 3-5 years and 70% of individuals with&#xD;
      pre-diabetes will develop into full-fledge T2DM within their lifetimes. According to the 2017&#xD;
      estimate, the disease burden of pre-diabetes at Western Pacific region was 7.6% (126.7&#xD;
      millions). The situation is more alarming in Malaysia where a national pre-diabetes&#xD;
      prevalence of 22.1% was noted. Currently available support and self-care services offered in&#xD;
      Public Hospitals such as the Diabetes Mellitus Treatment Adherence Clinics (DMTAC) are&#xD;
      managed based on the in-person appointment basis. Most of the clinics are available only in&#xD;
      specific locations. The need to travel long distance as well as long waiting hours has&#xD;
      deterred the success of the programs. This is particularly true for the urban poor who are&#xD;
      less likely to take time off from work than those from the higher income group. It is also&#xD;
      noteworthy to state that the management program when available, generally target the&#xD;
      diagnosed T2DM patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have shown that individuals with pre-diabetes can substantially reduce their risk of&#xD;
      progression to T2DM via participation in evidence-based lifestyle change programs. Previous&#xD;
      reports have recorded 54-58% reduction in risk for development to T2DM over 1-3 years with&#xD;
      the protective benefit persisting up to 10 years following completion of the program.&#xD;
      However, there are several considerations when implementing effective lifestyle intervention&#xD;
      program among the pre-diabetes populations in Malaysia. The intervention program should&#xD;
      easily be accessible and not confined to public primary and secondary healthcare centres&#xD;
      which are already suffering from an overcapacity. Furthermore, consultation should be&#xD;
      provided by properly trained healthcare professionals while the ease of communication between&#xD;
      the patients and the &quot;lifestyle coach&quot; should be made available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The advancement of information technology coupled with the increasing availability and&#xD;
      acceptance of internet and mobile devices provide useful opportunities for application of&#xD;
      wireless and mobile technology in order to enhance self-management of chronic conditions. The&#xD;
      incorporation of digital technologies can improve patient adherence and facilitate real-time&#xD;
      monitoring of vital biological measurements (i.e. via wearable). Additionally, the &quot;mobile&#xD;
      health&quot; (mHealth) services are easily scalable, thus providing opportunities to a greater&#xD;
      public accessibility and narrow the disparity in access to disease management. In this study,&#xD;
      the investigators propose to pilot a digital health supported pre-diabetes management program&#xD;
      based in an urban community pharmacy setting&#xD;

Participants will have access to a pharmacist-participant messaging, group messaging, daily challenges for behavior change, education articles (weekly bite-sized content over 24 weeks), food logging, steps and exercise logging, and feedback. They will be asked to log their weight, meals, and physical activity within the program on a weekly basis. Pharmacist will monitor participant progress through a web-based dashboard. Community pharmacist will be assisting users in setting specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, and time-based goals on a weekly basis.</description>
