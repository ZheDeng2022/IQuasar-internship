      This is a phase I dose-escalation study of oral PCLX-001, conducted in a multicenter,&#xD;
      non-randomized, open-label, non-controlled design. The study is comprised of two parts: Part&#xD;
      A (single-agent dose escalation) and Part B (single-agent expansion cohorts).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Part A dose-escalation, patients will be accrued in cohorts of 3 to 6 patients to each&#xD;
      dose level. A new dose level cannot open to accrual until toxicity has been determined in the&#xD;
      preceding dose level (i.e. all patients have completed their first cycle of therapy and data&#xD;
      for all patients in that dose level have been reviewed at a safety cohort review meeting).&#xD;
      Six patients will be treated at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended phase II&#xD;
      dose (RP2D). If required, the MTD cohort may be expanded by an additional 10 patients for&#xD;
      further toxicity and response assessment. The MTD cohort expansion may be restricted to&#xD;
      B-cell lymphoma or advanced solid tumours to ensure there is proper distribution during dose&#xD;
      escalation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Part B (single agent expansion cohorts), two expansion cohorts (N=20 each) will be opened&#xD;
      to determine the preliminary clinical activity of PCLX-001 at the RP2D:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Expansion Cohort A: Participants with advanced solid malignancies showing preclinical&#xD;
           sensitivity or molecular markers of sensitivity to PCLX-001. This includes breast,&#xD;
           nonsmall cell lung (NSCLC), small-cell lung (SCLC), colorectal (CRC), and bladder&#xD;
           cancers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Expansion Cohort B: Participants with relapsed/refractory (R/R) B-cell lymphoma: diffuse&#xD;
           large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), high grade B-cell lymphoma (HGBL), follicular lymphoma&#xD;
           (FL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), and Burkitt lymphoma. Transformed large B-cell&#xD;
           lymphoma will also be included.&#xD;

    <description>To ensure maximal safety in this first-in-human trial, the starting dose level was chosen to be 20 mg daily. PCLX-001 will be provided as an oral flat daily dose on a 28-day cycle. Missed doses for any reason will not be administered at a later time.&#xD;
The Dose-Escalation phase will follow a standard 3+3 cohort design. Three patients will be treated at each dose level. If 0/3 patients experience DLT, 3 patients will be treated at the next dose level. If DLT attributable to the treatment is experienced in 1/3 patients, three more patients (for a total of six patients) will be treated at that dose level. If no additional DLT is observed at the expanded dose level (i.e. 1/6 with DLT), the dose will be escalated. Escalation will terminate as soon as two or more patients experience any DLT attributable to study drugs, at a given dose level. DLT and determination of MTD will be based on cycle 1 toxicities.</description>

&#xD;
             Note: A woman is of childbearing potential, i.e. fertile, following menarche and until&#xD;
             becoming postmenopausal unless permanently sterile. Permanent sterilization methods&#xD;
             include but are not limited to hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy and bilateral&#xD;
             oophorectomy. A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an&#xD;
             alternative medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the&#xD;
             postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using&#xD;
             hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Women of childbearing potential and fertile men must agree to use adequate&#xD;
             contraception when sexually active from signing of the informed consent form for the&#xD;
             full study until at least 6 months after the last study drug administration. Patients&#xD;
             must agree to utilize 2 reliable and acceptable methods of contraception&#xD;
             simultaneously. A man is considered fertile after puberty unless permanently sterile&#xD;
             by bilateral orchiectomy. Men being treated with PCLX-001 are advised not to father a&#xD;
             child during and up to 6 months after treatment; prior to treatment, advice should be&#xD;
             sought for conserving sperm due to the chance of irreversible infertility as a&#xD;
             consequence of treatment with PCLX-001. Female partners of childbearing potential from&#xD;
             male study participants have to use adequate contraception / birth control between&#xD;
             signing of the informed consent and 6 months after the last administration of the&#xD;
             study drug if the male study participant is not sterilized.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The investigator or a designated associate is requested to advise the patient how to&#xD;
        achieve highly effective birth control. Highly effective (failure rate of less than 1% per&#xD;
        year) contraception methods, when used consistently and correctly, include:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Combined (estrogen and progestin containing: oral, intravaginal transdermal and&#xD;
             progestin-only (oral, injectable, implantable) hormonal contraception associated with&#xD;
             inhibition of ovulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Intra-uterine device (IUD) or intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bilateral tubal occlusion or vasectomized partner (provided that partner is the sole&#xD;
             sexual partner and has received medical assessment of the surgical success).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sexual abstinence (reliability to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the&#xD;
             clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Male patients with a female partner of reproductive potential must use a condom and ensure&#xD;
        that an additional form of contraception is also used during treatment and until 6 months&#xD;
        after last study drug administration. Patients must agree to utilize reliable and&#xD;
        acceptable methods of contraception simultaneously&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
         19. Treatment with anticancer chemotherapy or immunotherapy during the study or within 3&#xD;
             weeks before the first dose of study drug. For small-molecule drugs, a period of at&#xD;
             least 3 half-lives before the first dose of study drug is acceptable. Mitomycin C or&#xD;
             nitrosoureas should not be given within 6 weeks before the first dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Treatment with systemic steroids (prednisone dose ≥10 mg/day or equivalent dose).&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Acute toxic effects (CTCAE Grade ≥2) of previous anticancer chemotherapy or&#xD;
             immunotherapy that have not yet stabilized or if significant post-treatment toxicities&#xD;
             have been observed. (Note however that toxic effects of previous anticancer therapy&#xD;
             considered as chronic, such as chemotherapy-induced neuropathy, fatigue, alopecia, or&#xD;
             anorexia of CTCAE Grade &lt;2, for which further resolution is not expected, do not&#xD;
             prevent participation in this study.)&#xD;
&#xD;
         22. Radiotherapy for target lesions during study or within 3 weeks before the first dose&#xD;
             of study drug. Palliative radiotherapy is allowed for non-target lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
         23. Major surgery or significant trauma within 4 weeks before the first dose of study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
         24. Previous assignment to treatment during this study&#xD;
&#xD;
         25. Concomitant participation in another clinical study with investigational medicinal&#xD;
             product(s)&#xD;
&#xD;
         26. Substance abuse, medical, psychological, or social conditions that may interfere with&#xD;
             the patient's participation in the study or evaluation of the study results&#xD;
&#xD;
         27. Close affiliation with the investigational site; e.g. a close relative of the&#xD;
             investigator, dependent person (e.g. employee or student of the investigational site)&#xD;
&#xD;
         28. Use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers from 14 days prior to first&#xD;
             administration of study drug. Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers are prohibited&#xD;
             during the study and until the active FU visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
         29. Clinically relevant findings in the ECG such as a second- or third-degree&#xD;
             atrioventricular block, prolongation of the QRS complex &gt; 120 ms (except for bundle&#xD;
             branch block pattern), or prolongation of the of the QTc interval (Fridericia) over&#xD;
             450 ms unless agreed otherwise between the investigator and the sponsor's medically&#xD;
             responsible person&#xD;
