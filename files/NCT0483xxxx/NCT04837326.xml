  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of using white noise, embracing and&#xD;
      facilitated tucking on physiological parameters, crying duration and pain during heel lance&#xD;
      blood sampling in healthy newborns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was a prospective, randomized controlled trial. The study was conducted with&#xD;
      healthy newborns who were born between 38 and 42 weeks of gestation. The newborns were&#xD;
      divided into 4 groups by the applied pain relief methods during heel lance blood sampling in&#xD;
      newborns; embracing(n=40), white noise(n=40), facilitated tucking(n=40) and control group&#xD;
      (n=40). The physiological changes were evaluated before and after the procedure. NIPS&#xD;
      (Neonatal Infant Pain Scale) was used for pain scoring.&#xD;

      This study aimed to investigate the effect of white noise, embracing and facilitated tucking&#xD;
      on pain during heel lance blood sampling in newborns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS This randomized-controlled experimental study was performed to evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      white noise, embracing and facilitated tucking on pain during heel lance blood sampling in&#xD;
      newborns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting and sample:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study sample consisted of healthy newborns who were born and monitored in the Neonatology&#xD;
      Unit of a university hospital. The sample inclusion criteria were gestational age between 38&#xD;
      and 42 weeks, birth weight of 2500 - 4000 g, Apgar score of 8 and higher at 1st and 5th&#xD;
      minute, having breastfed at least half an hour before the procedure, not showing any disease&#xD;
      symptom, not having congenital anomaly, getting a good hearing test result and not having&#xD;
      received any invasive intervention other than Vitamin K and Hepatitis B vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following previous studies, G*Power (v3.1.9.2) was deployed to determine the sample number.&#xD;
      According to Jacob Cohen's effect size coefficients, assuming that evaluations carried out&#xD;
      among four independent groups would have a large effect size (d=0.40), it was determined that&#xD;
      the groups should comprise least 40 people, with a total of 160, for levels of α=0.05 and&#xD;
      1-β=0.95 (80% power). Children were assigned to 4 subgroups through randomization performed&#xD;
      using a computer program (www.randomizer.org): group 1 was the control group children who&#xD;
      received no intervention for pain relief (n = 40); group 2 received facilitated tucking (n =&#xD;
      40); group 3 received embracing (n = 40); and group 4 received white noise (n = 40).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mothers were informed by the researcher about the purpose of the study before collecting&#xD;
      data. The infants were held by their mothers so that their faces, arms, legs and respirations&#xD;
      could be easily viewed by the camera to evaluate the NIPS. All heel lance procedures were&#xD;
      performed by the same nurse working on the day shift (who had 6-year NICU experience). The&#xD;
      heel lance blood sampling point (outer side of the left heel), the lancet used in the&#xD;
      procedure, the sampling technique, and the antiseptic solution (70% alcohol) used in for the&#xD;
      procedure were the same for all the groups. The heel lance blood sampling procedure was&#xD;
      performed by the researcher in the blood sampling room in the Neonatology ward. Suitable&#xD;
      environmental conditions (ambient temperature, silent environment, etc.) were ensured in the&#xD;
      study room for the infant's comfort. A saturation probe was inserted to the right wrist of&#xD;
      the infant to monitor him/her. The behavioral responses to pain and crying durations of all&#xD;
      the responses were recorded by camera before, during and after the procedure. Then, these&#xD;
      records were played and the NIPS scores and crying durations of the infants were evaluated.&#xD;
      The physiological changes were recorded before, during and after the procedure, respectively.&#xD;
      In the data collection stage, 3 persons (nurse putting the infant in facilitated tucking&#xD;
      position, nurse taking blood sample, researcher shooting video) were required for facilitated&#xD;
      tucking position; 2 persons (nurse taking blood sample and researcher shooting video) for&#xD;
      maternal embracing since the infant was held by the mother and 2 persons (nurse taking blood&#xD;
      sample and researcher shooting video) for white noise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heel Lance Blood Sampling in Facilitated Tucking Position:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The infants were put in facilitated tucking position by an experienced newborn nurse. They&#xD;
      were put in facilitated tucking position so that their arms and legs were in a flexed midline&#xD;
      position close to their trunk in a side-lying position. They were positioned so that they&#xD;
      could move their extremities freely. They were held in facilitated tucking position for 120&#xD;
      seconds before the procedure. They were kept in facilitated tucking position until the blood&#xD;
      sample was taken from the right heel using a lancet. They were released 60 seconds after the&#xD;
      procedure and monitored for 120 seconds. The blood samples were taken by the researcher after&#xD;
      inserting the lancet in the first try.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heel Lance Blood Sampling When the Infant is Embraced by the Mother:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mother, whose privacy was protected, embraced the infant for 120 seconds before the&#xD;
      procedure. The infant was embraced by the mother during the heel lance blood sampling from&#xD;
      the left heel using a lancet. They were released 60 seconds after the procedure and monitored&#xD;
      for 120 seconds. The blood samples were taken by the researcher after inserting the lancet in&#xD;
      the first try.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heel Lance Blood Sampling Using White Noise:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 'Don't Let Your Baby Cry, PT.2' track from the 'Colic' album by Orhan Osman using the&#xD;
      'The Happiest Baby' album by Dr. Harvery Karp which was composed only of intrauterine was&#xD;
      made listened to the infants via Xperia Ultra Mp3 Player for 120 seconds before and 120&#xD;
      seconds after the heel lance blood sampling procedure. While white noise was made listened to&#xD;
      the infants before, during and after the procedure, Digital Sound LeverMeter brand noise&#xD;
      measurement device was put at a distance of 50 cm from the infant and the ambient noise level&#xD;
      was adjusted as 55 dB. The blood samples were taken by the researcher after inserting the&#xD;
      lancet in the first try.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Suitable environmental conditions (ambient temperature, silent environment, etc.) were&#xD;
      ensured in the study room for the infant's comfort. A saturation probe was inserted to the&#xD;
      right wrist of the infant to monitor him/her. A video record was taken for 120 seconds&#xD;
      without any intervention to the infants before and after the heel lance blood sampling&#xD;
      procedure. The blood samples were taken by the researcher after inserting the lancet in the&#xD;
      first try. Heel lance was performed in clinical routine for preterm infants in the control&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
