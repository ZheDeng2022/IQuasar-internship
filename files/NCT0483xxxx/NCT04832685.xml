      The specific aim of this proposed study is to investigate the feasibility and therapeutic&#xD;
      potential of LIFUP in changing negative cognition in depression. Specifically, the&#xD;
      investigators will study if modulating DMN activity can change maladaptive mind-wandering.&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that DOWN-modulation of the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), a&#xD;
      key DMN node, will decrease DMN resting state functional connectivity, perfusion, and&#xD;
      activation during a cognitive-affective task (description below). The investigators also&#xD;
      hypothesize that DOWN-modulation of the PCC will be associated with decreased mind-wandering&#xD;
      and increased mindfulness. Finally, the investigators hypothesize that the opposite will be&#xD;
      true for UP-modulation of the PCC.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The default mode network (DMN) is a network of structurally and functionally connected brain&#xD;
      regions that was first identified during &quot;passive&quot; states. Since its initial discovery, the&#xD;
      conceptualization of the DMN has evolved over time; the DMN has now been linked with a range&#xD;
      of higher-order cognitive processes such as spontaneous, self-generated thoughts (i.e.&#xD;
      mind-wandering) and thinking about oneself in the past, future, and in relation to others.&#xD;
      Given the DMN's involvement in cognition, researchers have investigated its role in&#xD;
      psychiatric disorders associated with cognitive issues, such as Major Depressive Disorder&#xD;
      (MDD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      MDD is a mood disorder in which people experience a persistent negative mood or loss of&#xD;
      interest or pleasure, thoughts of worthlessness and guilt, and/or suicidal ideation. The&#xD;
      majority of literature suggests that currently depressed individuals have increased DMN&#xD;
      resting-state functional connectivity at rest and greater DMN activation when processing&#xD;
      negative stimuli. Researchers have suggested that this DMN hyperactivity reflects the&#xD;
      tendency for depressed individuals to engage in negative cognition, such as maladaptive&#xD;
      mind-wandering (i.e. task-irrelevant thought when individuals are supposed to be focused on a&#xD;
      task) and rumination (i.e. negative, repetitive, self-focused thinking). Mind-wandering, in&#xD;
      general, has been linked to unhappiness. Rumination is associated with the maintenance of a&#xD;
      current depressive episode and is a predictor of future depressive episodes. Therefore,&#xD;
      changing these forms of negative cognition, via modulation of DMN activity, could be of&#xD;
      benefit to individuals with MDD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One way of modulating DMN activity is to use brain stimulation. The investigators have&#xD;
      previously used transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) of a DMN brain region to&#xD;
      effect a small yet significant reduction in mind-wandering behavior in a community sample.&#xD;
      However, tDCS has low spatial specificity and neuroimaging was not used to determine if tDCS&#xD;
      was actually changing mind-wandering via changes in DMN activity. Low Intensity Focused&#xD;
      Ultrasound Pulsation (LIFUP) is a novel non-invasive brain stimulation method which has high&#xD;
      spatial specificity, unlike other non-invasive brain stimulation methods such as Transcranial&#xD;
      Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) and tDCS. Specifically, LIFUP can deliver acoustic energy to a&#xD;
      brain region of a few millimeters in diameter. This method has been applied to the thalamus&#xD;
      to restore consciousness to patients in minimally conscious states, and the investigators&#xD;
      have been using this method in multiple IRB-approved studies as applied to the amygdala,&#xD;
      ventral striatum, and entorhinal cortex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims The specific aim of this proposed study is to investigate the feasibility and&#xD;
      therapeutic potential of LIFUP in changing negative cognition in depression. Specifically,&#xD;
      the investigators will study if modulating DMN activity can change maladaptive&#xD;
      mind-wandering. The investigators hypothesize that DOWN-modulation of the posterior cingulate&#xD;
      cortex (PCC), a key DMN node, will decrease DMN resting state functional connectivity,&#xD;
      perfusion, and activation during a cognitive-affective task (description below). The&#xD;
      investigators also hypothesize that DOWN-modulation of the PCC will be associated with&#xD;
      decreased mind-wandering and increased mindfulness. Finally, the investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that the opposite will be true for UP-modulation of the PCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Selection Twenty participants (n = 10 healthy controls, n = 10 individuals with MDD)&#xD;
      aged 18-64 years old will be recruited. The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5&#xD;
      Disorders, Research Version (SCID-5-RV)10 will be used to determine eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Enrollment Participants will be recruited through email announcements at MGH,&#xD;
      postings to college websites, and flyers (see attached flyer) posted at MGH and in the&#xD;
      community (e.g., community centers, public libraries, coffee shops, restaurants, and&#xD;
      laundromats). A phone screening will be performed to efficiently confirm likelihood that&#xD;
      subjects will meet inclusion and exclusion criteria prior to committing time for further&#xD;
      evaluation of eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent will be obtained prior to the performance of any protocol procedures. The&#xD;
      informed consent document will be used to explain in simple terms the risks and benefits of&#xD;
      study participation to the subject. The nature of the study will be fully explained to the&#xD;
      subject by the PI, co-investigators or specially-trained study staff. The subject will be&#xD;
      encouraged to ask questions pertaining to their participation in the study and the subject&#xD;
      may take as much time as they feel necessary to consider his/her participation in the study&#xD;
      as well as consult with family members or their physicians. Participation in this study is&#xD;
      voluntary and the subjects may withdraw from the study at any time. The IRB-approved informed&#xD;
      consent documents will be signed and dated by the subject and the person obtaining consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures After providing study information and obtaining IRB approved informed&#xD;
      consent, participants will complete up to three study visits on three different days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1 (up to 1 hour) For participants who are recruited as healthy controls, the SCID-5-RV&#xD;
      will be administered to determine if the participant has no current or past history of any&#xD;
      mood disorders. For participants who are recruited as individuals with MDD, the SCID-5-RV&#xD;
      will be administered to determine if the participant meets criteria for a current MDD&#xD;
      diagnosis. Participants will be excluded from further study procedures if they do not meet&#xD;
      the above-described criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits 2 and 3 (up to 3.5 hours each; spaced 1 week apart) Questionnaires At Visits 2 and 3,&#xD;
      participants will complete questionnaires assessing depressive symptoms (Beck Depression&#xD;
      Inventory), anxiety (The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory), mindfulness (Five Facet Mindfulness&#xD;
      Questionnaire), and rumination (Ruminative Responses Scale of the Response Styles&#xD;
      Questionnaire). To assess the subjective experience of LIFUP and its effects on mood,&#xD;
      participants will rate their negative and positive mood on Visual Analog Scales as well as&#xD;
      complete the 11-factor Altered States of Consciousness questionnaire (ASC) after LIFUP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Computer Task After completing questionnaires, participants will practice the&#xD;
      cognitive-affective task they will be performing in the MRI scanner before and after LIFUP.&#xD;
      Participants will complete a modified version of the Multi-Source Interference Task (MSIT)&#xD;
      overlaid on negative, neutral, and positive images from the International Affective Picture&#xD;
      System (IAPS). Subjects must identify the number in a three digit number that is different.&#xD;
      For example, if the participant sees &quot;010&quot; the correct answer would be &quot;1&quot; since it is the&#xD;
      different number. This MSIT-IAPS task has been used to assess cognitive-affective deficits in&#xD;
      bipolar disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this task, participants will also be randomly interrupted. Instead of seeing a digit&#xD;
      on the screen, participants will be asked if they were thinking about the task or something&#xD;
      else. Participants respond by pressing one key if they were having Task-related thoughts&#xD;
      (Task) and another key for task unrelated (Not Task) thoughts. Participants then see other&#xD;
      screens asking if they were thinking about themselves, the past, present, or future, and if&#xD;
      they were having positive, neutral, or negative thoughts. After answering these questions,&#xD;
      participants resume seeing digits on the screen. The investigators have used these random&#xD;
      thought probes during the MSIT in a previous tDCS study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI Scan After completing the practice computer task, participants will complete the MR&#xD;
      Screening Safety form. After confirming the participant does not have MRI contraindications,&#xD;
      they will be scanned using a 3 Tesla Siemens MRI scanner at the Athinoula A. Martinos Center&#xD;
      for Biomedical Imaging. At baseline, a T1 MEMPRAGE structural scan,&#xD;
      blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) resting state scan, Arterial Spin Labelled (ASL) scan,&#xD;
      and a BOLD functional MRI scan paired with the MSIT-IAPS task (described above) will be&#xD;
      collected. Participants will then exit the MRI scanner and will be asked to retrospectively&#xD;
      report on their mind-wandering thoughts during the MSIT-IAPS task, using the Thought Sampling&#xD;
      Questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LIFUP Sonication Participants will next be fitted with the LIFUP device, the BX Pulsar 1002&#xD;
      (BrainSonix Corporation). The transducer will be placed on the head using landmarks and will&#xD;
      be positioned using their structural MRI scan to localize the PCC. Participants will then&#xD;
      receive either DOWN-modulation (Pulse Repetition Frequency = 10 Hz, Pulse-Width = 0.5 ms,&#xD;
      Duty Cycle = 5%, ISPPA = 14.4 mW/cm2, 720 mW/cm2) or UP-modulation (Pulse Repetition&#xD;
      Frequency = 100 Hz, Pulse-Width = 0.5 ms, Duty Cycle = 5%, ISPPA = 14.4 mW/cm2, ISPTA = 720&#xD;
      mW/cm2). The order will be counterbalanced across subjects. The sonications will be delivered&#xD;
      in a 30-seconds on, 30-seconds off block design, for a total duration of 10 minutes. The&#xD;
      investigators are using the same LIFUP parameters in other IRB-approved LIFUP studies and&#xD;
      these parameters have been safely used at other research collaborator sites at UCLA and MUSC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After receiving LIFUP, participants will then be scanned again using the same MRI protocol as&#xD;
      described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biostatistical Analysis fMRI data during the MSIT-IAPS task will be analyzed using SPM12&#xD;
      software (Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, UK). Individual subject-level&#xD;
      data will be slice-time corrected, realigned and unwarped, coregistered to the individual's&#xD;
      structural images, normalized, and smoothed. First-level contrast images will be created&#xD;
      comparing BOLD activation during the MSIT-IAPS task before and after LIFUP. These contrast&#xD;
      images will then be entered into a 2nd level random effects flexible factorial model. The&#xD;
      investigators will investigate whether there is a group (MDD versus healthy control) by&#xD;
      condition (UP vs. DOWN modulation) interaction on BOLD activation in DMN regions. Beta signal&#xD;
      values will be extracted from DMN regions and the investigators will investigate if there are&#xD;
      significant correlations between DMN activation and behavioral measures of depressive&#xD;
      symptoms, anxiety, and mindfulness/mind-wandering.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BOLD resting state scan data will be similarly preprocessed and entered into CONN toolbox.&#xD;
      The PCC will be used as a seed region and Fischer-transformed functional connectivity beta&#xD;
      values with other DMN regions will be extracted for each individual subject.&#xD;
      Repeated-measures ANOVAs will be conducted to again investigate whether there is a group by&#xD;
      condition interaction on DMN resting state functional connectivity. Correlational analyses&#xD;
      will also be performed to explore correlations with behavioral measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ASL data will be analyzed using Bayesian Inference for Arterial Spin Labeling MRI. Perfusion&#xD;
      maps corresponding to pre and post LIFUP will be subtracted from each other to determine if&#xD;
      there is decreased or increased perfusion in DMN regions associated with UP vs. DOWN&#xD;
      modulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have demonstrated that 20 participants are sufficient to achieve statistical&#xD;
      significance (p &lt; 0.05) in a voxel-based analysis.&#xD;
