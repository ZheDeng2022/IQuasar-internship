      This study is looking for the predictors of the survival or rehospitalization of patients&#xD;
      with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Participants who are discharged from an&#xD;
      acute heart failure hospitalization are enrolled. The prognostic factors provide information&#xD;
      about the treatment of this disease in the future. This study is a retrospective&#xD;
      observational study. Investigators will collect data from May 2014 to July 2019 in the heart&#xD;
      failure center of Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. A follow-up is conducted at the&#xD;
      Kaohsiung HF center until August 2020. Investigators want to know whether the risk factors&#xD;
      such as atrial fibrillation, diabetes, nephropathy, and some biochemical indexes can be an&#xD;
      index that predicts future survival or rehospitalization of these patients. Besides,&#xD;
      investigators will also explore the cardiac rehabilitation can also effectively improve the&#xD;
      survival rate of such patients.&#xD;

    <description>Change from baseline to Month 6 and month 12 for the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire short form (KCCQ12) clinical summary score. KCCQ12 is a 12-item, self-administered instrument that quantifies physical function, symptoms (frequency, severity and recent change), social function, self-efficacy and knowledge, and quality of life. KCCQ12 clinical summary score is a composite assessment of physical limitations and total symptom scores.&#xD;
Scores are transformed to a range of 0-100, in which higher scores reflect better health status.</description>

        A total of 792 patients were recruited between May 2014 and July 2019 and follow-up&#xD;
        conducted at the Kaohsiung HF center until August 2020. All patients were introduced to a&#xD;
