  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) is the preferred treatment for renal stones &gt;2 cm or&#xD;
      resistant to ESWL. Postoperative pain following this invasive surgery adds to the morbidity&#xD;
      of patient which requires additional analgesia and can affect the quality of care. To lower&#xD;
      the morbidity of PCNL, proper and adequate management of postoperative pain remains an&#xD;
      integral component of PCNL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are many ways to reduce the postoperative pain following PCNL including mini PCNL,&#xD;
      tubeless PCNL, use of regional analgesia etc. However the modality of analgesic technique is&#xD;
      still a matter of debate. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of intercostal&#xD;
      nerve block compared with peritract infiltration in patient undergoing PCNL. Specifically,&#xD;
      the study will look on to the demography of patients undergoing PCNL and their indications.&#xD;
      The study will also compare the intensity of pain in two groups using visual analogue scale&#xD;
      (VAS). The study will be a prospective double blinded randomized clinical trial done at&#xD;
      Department of Urology and Kidney Transplant Surgery, Tribhuvan University Teaching hospital&#xD;
      (TUTH). The time frame of this study will be of 1 year or when sample size is fulfilled&#xD;
      including all the patients who visit the hospital for PCNL and fulfils the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria. At the end of our study we expect to conclude that the use of intercostal nerve&#xD;
      block is superior or inferior than or equal to peritract infiltration in alleviating the&#xD;
      postoperative pain following PCNL.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence and prevalence of renal calculi have increased globally across all ages, sex,&#xD;
      and race, probably due to change in dietary habits and global warming. PCNL is considered&#xD;
      'gold standard' for the management of large renal calculi because it is less invasive and&#xD;
      morbid than the open surgery. Currently, the indications for PCNL include large size renal&#xD;
      calculi (&gt;1.5-2 cm), staghorn calculi, upper tract calculi not responding to other modalities&#xD;
      of treatment, lower pole stones, cystine nephrolithiasis, and stones in anatomically abnormal&#xD;
      kidneys. However, the procedure causes postoperative pain, mostly due to dilatation of the&#xD;
      renal capsule, the parenchyma and pain along the tract of the nephrostomy tube. So the&#xD;
      postoperative pain remains an integral part of management. Postoperative pain management not&#xD;
      only reduces patient suffering but also improve patient satisfaction, reduces morbidity and&#xD;
      in parallel enhances recovery, improves rehabilitation, reduces hospital stay and thereby&#xD;
      overall hospital cost. The postoperative pain due to the procedure may vary with individual&#xD;
      pain perception, use of percutaneous nephrostomy (PCN) tubes, comorbid conditions, choice of&#xD;
      analgesic route, anesthetic agents and postoperative course. Small calibers of tubes, even&#xD;
      mini PCNL or tubeless PCNL and regional analgesia such as intercostal nerve block, peritract&#xD;
      infiltration, paravertebral block etc. could further decrease postoperative pain and&#xD;
      analgesic requirement and hence improving postoperative patient comfort. However, studies on&#xD;
      these techniques have produced conflicting results due to the use of different local&#xD;
      anesthetics, various regional techniques, and different study designs. So this study aims to&#xD;
      compare the efficacy of intercostal nerve block and peritract infiltration with 0.25%&#xD;
      bupivacaine in alleviating postoperative pain following the procedure with the subjective&#xD;
      assessment of pain&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rational/justification :&#xD;
&#xD;
      • The optimal method of pain control after percutaneous nephrolithotomy remains controversial&#xD;
      till now.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We need better technique of analgesia to decrease the pain following PCNL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intercostal nerve block and peritract infiltration are common regional analgesic methods&#xD;
           used by most of the investigators that had shown to be adequate for postoperative pain&#xD;
           control.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study may be helpful in providing evidence for a clinical guideline to manage&#xD;
           postoperative pain that will eventually help to decrease the morbidity and bring better&#xD;
           outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General Objective :&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the efficacy of intercostal nerve block and peritract infiltration with 0.25%&#xD;
      bupivacaine in percutaneous nephrolithotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Objective :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To analyse the demography of the patient [age, sex, BMI, stone size and laterality,&#xD;
           renal function test, stone burden (size, Guy's Stone score etc.)] undergoing PCNL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the intensity of pain using visual analogue score, resting and dynamic VAS&#xD;
           scores, following PCNL between two groups (ICNB and PTI).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the time to first rescue analgesia and total analgesic requirement between&#xD;
           both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To document the complications of both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Hypothesis Is Intercostal nerve block more efficacious than peritract infiltration&#xD;
      following PCNL in alleviating pain?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Variables&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Independent Variables: Age, Sex, BMI, stone location, laterality and size, Guys Stone&#xD;
           score (burden), ASA grade, comorbidity, Group I (ICBN), Group P (PTI) nephrostomy tract&#xD;
           size (mini vs standard), no of Tracts (single vs multiple), use to tube (tube vs&#xD;
           tubeless), length of hospital stay, stone clearance, complications&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dependent Variables R-VAS score, D-VAS score, Time to first analgesic demand, Total&#xD;
           analgesic requirement&#xD;

    <description>Patients undergoing PCNL who fulfil the inclusion criteria will be identified at the time of admission. • Patients will be randomized in two groups using sealed envelope method into ICNB (group I) and PTI (group P) prior to surgery. After the procedure (intervention) the intensity of pain will be evaluated by an independent observer (the researcher or an independent ward nurse) blinded to the allocated groups at postoperative 2, 8, 12 and 24 hours. The pain score will be assessed separately by Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), a 10-point scale ranging from 0, minimum or no pain, to 10, the maximum pain score perceived or imagined by the patient, at rest (RVAS) and on deep breathing or coughing known as dynamic VAS (DVAS). •</description>
