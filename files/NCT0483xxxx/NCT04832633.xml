      Background: The contrast time-enhancement profiles of pulmonary artery (PA) and the aorta&#xD;
      differ by using computed tomography (CT) angiography. Our purpose is to identify the optimal&#xD;
      CT protocol for assessment of both vessels in one-time CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The investigators prospectively enrolled 101 cases of CT angiography with suspicion&#xD;
      of pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection in our center from 2018 to 2020. Forty cases&#xD;
      receiving traditional two-time CT scans were collected retrospectively from 2015 to 2018.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators designed four groups: test bolus (TB) I, II and bolus-tracking (BT) I, II.&#xD;
      The enhancement of the both vessels and the radiation dose of these four groups were&#xD;
      collected. Traditional group was separated into traditional PA scan and traditional aorta&#xD;
      scan. Data analyzed among the BT groups and the traditional groups were performed.&#xD;

      Patients All cases with suspicion of PE or AD referred for CTA in our hospital between March&#xD;
      2018 and February 2020 had been reviewed. Those cases with known allergic history, poor renal&#xD;
      function (creatinine level&gt;1.5 mg/dl), pregnant women or age less than twenty years old were&#xD;
      excluded from the study. The investigators finally enrolled and analyzed 101 cases of CTA.&#xD;
      The collected data included age, sex, blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), Hounsfield unit&#xD;
      (HU) at bifurcation of PA, HU at the descending aorta with the same level of PA bifurcation,&#xD;
      time to peak enhancement, and radiation dose. This study had been approved by the&#xD;
      institutional review board in our hospital. All patients signed informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, forty cases with suspicion of PE or AD performing traditional two-time CT scans&#xD;
      were reviewed retrospectively. For controlling the dose of contrast media, the two-time CT&#xD;
      scans in our hospital were performed with single 80ml contrast media injection at 3ml/sec,&#xD;
      followed by 20ml normal saline injection at 3ml/sec. The CT PA angiography was performed when&#xD;
      the density of the PA achieved baseline PA density plus 150 HU during tracking scans,&#xD;
      followed immediately by the CT aortogram. The investigators compared the experimental groups&#xD;
      and traditional groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental designs of contrast media injection After the contrast injection, the contrast&#xD;
      media goes to the right heart via peripheral veins and then the contrast is pumped out to the&#xD;
      PA. The interval from contrast injection to the peak enhancement of PA is defined as P&#xD;
      seconds. After pulmonary circulation, the contrast media travels through the pulmonary veins,&#xD;
      the left atrium, and the left ventricle and contracts into the aorta. The interval from&#xD;
      contrast injection to the peak enhancement of aorta is defined as A seconds. Afterward, the&#xD;
      contrast media starts a new cycle of systemic circulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the published data, for the pulmonary artery, adequate attenuation is known to be&#xD;
      greater than 180 HU, and for the aorta, sufficient attenuation is known to be greater than&#xD;
      200 HU. However, the requirement of vascular enhancement for diagnosing PE is high because&#xD;
      the size of the PA is significantly tapering and the thrombus in the distal PA branches will&#xD;
      be vague if the enhancement of the PA is not vivid. Therefore, insufficient enhancement of&#xD;
      the PA restricts the ability to diagnose PE. The investigators design a biphasic contrast&#xD;
      media injection protocol, including a low rate(2ml/s) first phase injection and high&#xD;
      rate(3ml/s) second phase injection, followed by high rate(3ml/s) normal saline injection. The&#xD;
      first phase injection is kept for (A - P) seconds and the second phase injection is kept&#xD;
      until the rest contrast media is completely injected. Theoretically, when the start time of&#xD;
      the scan is at the A seconds, the first phase contrast media is about to significantly&#xD;
      enhance the aorta, though the peak time and peak enhancement will not be optimal because the&#xD;
      time intervals are calculated on the basis of high rate (3ml/s) injection. On the other hand,&#xD;
      the second phase contrast media will maximally enhance the PA at the same time because the&#xD;
      second phase contrast media has been injected for P seconds [A-(A-P)=P].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pre-diagnostic axial CT images were set at the level of the PA bifurcation using 10ml&#xD;
      test bolus contrast media injection at the 3ml/s rate. Radiology technologists in our team&#xD;
      placed circular region of interest (ROI) within the areas of PA bifurcation and the&#xD;
      descending aorta at the same level. The CT densities were collected and demonstrated the&#xD;
      time-enhancement data. The peak enhancement time for the PA was chosen as P seconds and that&#xD;
      for the aorta as A seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators designed four groups, including two groups using the test bolus (TB) method&#xD;
      and two groups using the bolus-tracking (BT) method. The two TB groups were different at the&#xD;
      total amount of contrast media with 80ml and 70ml respectively. The P and A seconds were&#xD;
      calculated from the pre-diagnostic images and the start time of scan was fixed at A seconds.&#xD;
      Based on the results of initial 22 cases in the two TB groups, the mean interval between P&#xD;
      and A seconds was approximately 9.5 seconds. Therefore, we roughly assumed the A-P interval&#xD;
      in most cases was about 10 seconds and designed the two BT groups with a fixed 10-second&#xD;
      first phase contrast media injection time. The start time of scan was based on the tracking&#xD;
      method when the descending aorta at the PA bifurcation achieved the baseline density plus 150&#xD;
      HU. The tracking scan started after contrast injection was initiated for 15 seconds. The two&#xD;
      BT groups were also different at the total amount of contrast media with 80ml and 70ml&#xD;
      respectively, including the 10ml for the pre-diagnostic images in order to have the same&#xD;
      condition before the diagnostic CT images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Details of the four experimental groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. TB I: The investigators use the TB method with biphasic injection, followed by the&#xD;
           saline flush. Initially, the investigators inject the 10 ml of test contrast media with&#xD;
           a velocity of 3ml/s and apply the ROI at the bifurcation of PA and descending aorta at&#xD;
           the same level. The dynamic curve demonstrates the time to peak enhancement of P second&#xD;
           and A second. The first phase of contrast media injection uses a velocity of 2ml/s and&#xD;
           the volume of contrast is measured as 2ml/s multiply (A-P) second. The second phase of&#xD;
           contrast media injection uses a velocity of 3ml/s and the volume of contrast media is&#xD;
           70ml minus the amount of first phase injection. The total volume of the contrast media&#xD;
           is 80ml, including the 10ml for pre-diagnostic test bolus images. The investigators&#xD;
           performed the saline flush following the administration of the contrast media with 20 ml&#xD;
           normal saline. The start time of the diagnostic scan is at the A second.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. TB II: This group is similar to the TB I. However, the investigators use the lesser&#xD;
           contrast media in the second phase of injection. The second phase of contrast media&#xD;
           injection is applied with a velocity of 3ml/s and the volume of the contrast media is&#xD;
           60ml minus the amount of first phase injection. The total volume of the contrast media&#xD;
           is 70 ml, also including the 10ml for pre-diagnostic test bolus images. The following&#xD;
           saline flush uses 30 ml of normal saline. The start time of the diagnostic scan is at&#xD;
           the A second as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. BT I: Initially, 10ml of test contrast media was administrated but no calculation was&#xD;
           performed for these pre-diagnostic test bolus images in this group. Unlike the TB&#xD;
           method, the investigators use 10 seconds as the fixed interval of (A-P) in this group.&#xD;
           The first phase of contrast media injection uses a velocity of 2ml/s and thus the volume&#xD;
           of contrast is 20ml. The second phase of contrast media injection is administered with a&#xD;
           velocity of 3ml/s and the volume of the contrast media is 70ml minus 20ml. The total&#xD;
           volume of the contrast media is 80 ml. The following saline flush uses 20 ml of normal&#xD;
           saline. The tracking scan started after contrast injection was initiated for 15 seconds.&#xD;
           The ROI is placed in the descending aorta at the same level of PA bifurcation and the&#xD;
           diagnostic CT scan is triggered when the density in the ROI achieves the baseline&#xD;
           density plus 150HU.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. BT II: This group is similar to the BT I. The first phase of injection is the same as&#xD;
           the BT I group. The investigators use lesser contrast media in the second phase of&#xD;
           contrast injection. The second phase of contrast media injection is applied with a&#xD;
           velocity of 3ml/s and the volume of the contrast media is 60ml minus 20ml. The total&#xD;
           volume of the contrast media is 70 ml, including the 10ml for pre-diagnostic test bolus&#xD;
           images. The following saline flush uses 30 ml of normal saline. The protocol for&#xD;
           triggering diagnostic CT scan is the same as that in BT I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CT scan technique and contrast medium administration CT was performed using a 320-MDCT (Canon&#xD;
      Aquilion PRIME CT scanner, Toshiba Medical Systems, Otawara, Japan). Prior to the initiation&#xD;
      of the diagnostic CT scan, a series of low-radiation sequential axial pre-diagnostic CT&#xD;
      images were acquired at a fixed level of the PA bifurcation while the test bolus of contrast&#xD;
      media was being injected at 3ml/s with 10ml amount. This pre-diagnostic CT scan was applied&#xD;
      for all patients. The scan parameters were as the following: 5 mm section thickness, 100kVp,&#xD;
      automatic exposure control of current (mA), and 0.5 second rotation time. Following the&#xD;
      completion of the pre-diagnostic CT scan, the patient was given a breath-hold instruction for&#xD;
      the standard diagnostic CT using either TB or BT method. Scanning was performed in the&#xD;
      cranial-caudal direction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All cases were administrated contrast medium with 300 mg iodine (I)/ml Omnipaque using a&#xD;
      dual-power injector (MEDRAD Stellant CT injector). All cases were administrated 10ml of&#xD;
      contrast medium for establishment of pre-diagnostic CT images. The total volume of contrast&#xD;
      media was fixed at 70 or 80 ml in accordance with the designed injection protocols. For all&#xD;
      cases, a right upper limb antecubital venous access was achieved using an 18 or 20 Gauge&#xD;
      venous catheter. The biphasic contrast injection protocol was conducted with two connected&#xD;
      phases of contrast medium injection immediately followed by saline flush. The investigators&#xD;
      performed the saline flush at the rate of 3ml/s following the administration of the contrast&#xD;
      medium with different amounts (20 or 30 ml) to achieve 100ml fluid injection in total.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimation of radiation dose The dose length product (DLP) of all cases was recorded.&#xD;
      Effective radiation dose was estimated by multiplying the DLP by a conversion factor. The&#xD;
      effective radiation dose correlates with different parts of the body which varies the&#xD;
      radiation sensitivity of the tissue. Our study applied conversion factor of 0.014 mSV/(mGy x&#xD;
      cm) based on the region of chest and abdomen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test was used for comparing the data of different&#xD;
      groups. If the test of homogeneity of variances was not statistically different, Scheffe&#xD;
      method was used for post hoc analysis. On the contrary, Games-Howell method was used for post&#xD;
      hoc analysis. A p value of ≤0.05 was considered statistically significant. All statistical&#xD;
      analysis was performed using software (SPSS version 25.0, IBM Corp.).&#xD;
