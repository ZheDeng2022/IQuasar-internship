      Introduction: Glycemic control in acutely ill stroke patients with hyperglycemia is vital.&#xD;
      Although insulin is the choice of anti-diabetic agent during acute stage, it is not clear&#xD;
      which insulin regimen is better in terms of glycemic control and prevention of hypoglycemia&#xD;
      in hospitalized acute stroke patients who are usually on small frequent nasogastric tube&#xD;
      feeding. The present study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of human insulin (regular&#xD;
      insulin and neutral protamine hagedorn, NPH insulin) to analog insulin (basal insulin&#xD;
      glargine and rapid acting insulin aspart) in hospitalized acute stroke patients with&#xD;
      hyperglycemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification: Analog insulins are developed by minor alteration of the amino acid chain&#xD;
      which alters their pharmacokinetics and make them more physiological. However, these insulins&#xD;
      are costly and are not widely available. Conventional human insulins are more commonly used&#xD;
      in our country. Comparison of these two regimen is necessary in our own setting to optimize&#xD;
      optimal glycemic management of hospitalized acute stroke patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: In this single-center, open-label, randomized trial, 100 patients with acute&#xD;
      stroke and hyperglycemia (capillary blood glucose ≥10 mmol/L on 2 or more occasions) or&#xD;
      history of type 2 DM admitted in the in-patient Department of Neurology, National Institute&#xD;
      of Neurosciences (NINS) &amp; Hospital will be randomly assigned to receive human insulin or&#xD;
      modern insulin therapy in 1:1 ratio. The study will be carried out from February to June&#xD;
      2021. Blood glucose (BG) will be monitored by standardized glucometer thrice a day and&#xD;
      insulin dose will be adjusted daily. The primary outcome of the study will be the differences&#xD;
      in glycemic control between groups, as measured by mean daily BG concentration during the&#xD;
      hospital stay. Secondary outcomes include differences between treatment groups in any of the&#xD;
      following measures: number of hypoglycemic events (BG &lt;3.9 mmol/L), total daily dose of&#xD;
      insulin, length of hospital stay, hospital complications and mortality.&#xD;

      METHODOLOGY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type of study: Single-center, open-label, randomized trial Place of Study: Department of&#xD;
      Neurology, National Institute of Neurosciences &amp; Hospital, Dhaka.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Period: February to June, 2021 Study population: Patients admitted in the Department of&#xD;
      Neurology with acute stroke and hyperglycemia&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size was calculated according to following formula for non-inferiority trial (17):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Here, N= sample size per group α= 0.05 β= 0.20 δ0= a clinically acceptable margin (assumed as&#xD;
      3 mmol/L of blood glucose) S2= Pooled standard deviation of both comparison group= 8 So,&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a result, 50 patients will be randomly assigned to two treatment groups (50 human insulin&#xD;
      regimen, 50 analog insulin regimen).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedure Patients will be randomly assigned to receive either a human insulin regimen&#xD;
      (starting with regular insulin three times a day with NPH insulin twice a day) or analog&#xD;
      insulin regimen (basal insulin glargine once daily and insulin aspart three times a day)&#xD;
      following a computer-generated randomization table. All oral antidiabetic drugs will be&#xD;
      discontinued on admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For a patient who is known to have diabetes but were not getting insulin previously (or&#xD;
      previous insulin dosage is not known), insulin therapy will be started at a total daily dose&#xD;
      of 0.3-0.4 units/kg/day for an admission BG between 10-15 mmol/L or 0.5-0.6 units/kg/day for&#xD;
      a BG &gt;15 mmol/L. In previously insulin treated patients, ongoing total daily dose of insulin&#xD;
      will be started. If there is history of poor glycemic control with ongoing insulin dose, then&#xD;
      10-20% increase of daily dose of insulin will be considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For a patient who is not known to have diabetes, insulin therapy will be started if admission&#xD;
      BG is &gt;10 mmol/L in two or more occasions. A total daily dose of 0.3-0.4 units/kg/day will be&#xD;
      started if admission BG is 10-15 mmol/L and 0.5-0.6 units/kg/day for a BG &gt;15 mmol/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients treated with human insulin regimen will receive 50% of total daily dose as NPH&#xD;
      insulin at around 6 am and 6 pm, while the rest 50% regular human insulin three times a day&#xD;
      in 3 equally divided doses at around 6 am, 12 pm and 6 pm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients treated with modern insulin regimen will receive 50% of total daily dose as basal&#xD;
      insulin glargine at the same time of day and 50% as insulin aspart given in 3 equally divided&#xD;
      doses at 6 am, 12 pm and 6 pm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both groups, insulin dosage will be adjusted daily to a target fasting and premeal BG&#xD;
      7.8-10.0 mmol/L in the absence of hypoglycemia. Insulin dosage will be adjusted daily&#xD;
      according to BG values. If the fasting and/or premeal BG is 10-15 mmol/L in the absence of&#xD;
      hypoglycemia, the total daily dose will be increased by 10% every day. If the fasting and/or&#xD;
      premeal BG is &gt;15 mmol/L, the insulin daily dose will be increased by 20% every day. If a&#xD;
      patient develops hypoglycemia (BG &lt;3.9 mmol/L), the insulin daily dose will be decreased by&#xD;
      20%. Supplemental regular insulin will be given in addition to scheduled mealtime insulin for&#xD;
      BG &gt;10 mmol/L using a supplemental insulin protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BG will be measured before each bolus insulin injection (at 6 am, 12 pm and 6 pm). Glycated&#xD;
      hemoglobin (HbA1c) will be measured after hospital admission if not done within last three&#xD;
      months. Except anti-diabetic treatment, other treatments will be continued as per the&#xD;
      decisions of the treating physicians. If NG feeding is discontinued and patient is kept NPO,&#xD;
      conventional group will receive neutralizing insulin with any dextrose containing fluid along&#xD;
      with low dose NPH insulin, if needed. Modern insulin group will receive neutralizing insulin&#xD;
      with any dextrose containing fluid with glargine insulin as before.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After recruitment, each recruited patient will be visited daily (even in holidays according&#xD;
      to a predefined schedule) by one of the investigators and insulin dose will be adjusted&#xD;
      according to glucose profile of previous day. Insulin injection and capillary blood glucose&#xD;
      monitoring by glucometer will be done by trained nurses as part of their routine patient&#xD;
      care. Doctors and nurses on duty will be provided with cell number of the investigators who&#xD;
      will receive call on 24/7 basis for any emergency or uncertainty regarding management of&#xD;
      hyperglycemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypoglycemia is regarded as the only short-term adverse event of insulin. As both treatment&#xD;
      arms will use established and recognized insulin regimen, no compensation will be provided to&#xD;
      the patient or his/her attendants in case of any adverse event. As most of the hospitalized&#xD;
      patients have severe stroke with case fatality rate around 20%, death will not be regarded as&#xD;
      parameter of primary treatment outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During discharge, last in-hospital insulin dose will be continued with education to the&#xD;
      caregiver regarding insulin injection and glucose monitoring technique. No follow up visit is&#xD;
      included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol deviation and protocol violation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deviation to protocol will be recorded and reported to ethical committee as soon as possible.&#xD;
      Failure to obtain informed written consent, use of incorrect insulin regimen, not fulfilling&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria will be regarded as protocol violation and will be reported&#xD;
      to ethical committee immediately. In case of protocol violation, the data of related&#xD;
      participant will be discarded.&#xD;
