    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate whether intramuscular progesterone supplementation&#xD;
      will improve clinical pregnancy rates and ongoing pregnancy rates in patients with decreased&#xD;
      serum progesterone levels on the day of embryo transfer in artificial frozen cycles.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cryopreservation of frozen-thawed embryos has become a cardinal procedure in assisted&#xD;
      reproductive therapies. This can be attributed to the development of the vitrification&#xD;
      process and the improvement of embryo survival rates after thawing, leading to the&#xD;
      progressive increase in the use of frozen embryo transfer (FET).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The need for FET has also increased greatly due to the implementation of a single embryo&#xD;
      transfer policy in many areas of the world to reduce multiple pregnancies. This has led to an&#xD;
      increase in surplus embryos derived from ovarian stimulation cycles. Moreover, although the&#xD;
      'freeze all' technique or elective embryo cryopreservation was mainly developed for patients&#xD;
      with an increased risk of developing ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, its use has now been&#xD;
      extended to cover other indications, such as cycles involving pre-implantation genetic&#xD;
      diagnosis, late-follicular progesterone elevation and embryo-endometrial asynchrony.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite this increased need for FET, there still exists debate over the best method to&#xD;
      implement the practice. The two most common used treatment regimens to prepare the&#xD;
      endometrium for embryo transfer are the so-called natural cycle (NC) and the hormone&#xD;
      replacement therapy (HRT) cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a NC FET, there is no medical intervention apart from ultrasound monitoring during the&#xD;
      proliferative phase, to schedule the transfer when the endometrium is synchronized to the&#xD;
      developmental stage of the embryo. Although the advantage is the absence of estrogen&#xD;
      supplementation, this protocol entails more frequent visits to the clinic and less cycle&#xD;
      control. Despite this, there is still an ongoing debate whether frozen embryos transferred in&#xD;
      a 'more physiologic' non-stimulated endometrium, may not only result in higher pregnancy&#xD;
      rates, but also potentially decrease maternal and neonatal morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, in the HRT cycle, also referred to as an artificial cycle, exogenous&#xD;
      administration of estrogens and progesterone is used to mimic a natural cycle and therefore&#xD;
      endometrial development. Although originally developed to allow embryo transfers in&#xD;
      recipients of donated oocytes, the HRT protocol has proven to be successful in the general&#xD;
      population as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The advantage of this protocol is the easy scheduling and minimal cycle monitoring. There are&#xD;
      however, potential disadvantages associated with its widespread usage, including the&#xD;
      increased expense and risks of estrogen supplementation such as thromboembolic events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Generally speaking, in HRT cycles, progesterone supplementation begins once the proliferation&#xD;
      of the endometrium with the administration of estrogens is considered sufficient.&#xD;
      Progesterone is initiated to promote the final phase of endometrial preparation prior to&#xD;
      embryo transfer, however, there is little agreement on the ideal route or dose of&#xD;
      progesterone supplementation itself.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As regards the route of administration, when compared to intramuscular (IM) injections,&#xD;
      patients seem to prefer the vaginal route owing to its quick, easy and painless&#xD;
      administration. Despite this, there is limited data comparing IM versus vaginal progesterone&#xD;
      administration, with some being in favour of the IM route and others showing no significant&#xD;
      differences in terms of outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the more recent focus on intramuscular rather than the traditional transvaginal&#xD;
      progesterone supplementation, stems from newer mounting evidence that transvaginal&#xD;
      supplementation not only increases vaginal discharge, but also has a limited effect in&#xD;
      increasing serum progesterone levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Boynukalin et al., 2019 explored the idea of intramuscular progesterone supplementation in&#xD;
      HRT FET cycles further, by substituting the traditional vaginal progesterone with 100mg of&#xD;
      daily IM progesterone during endometrial preparation and thereafter till the 10th week of&#xD;
      pregnancy. They found that the mean progesterone level on the day of ET was significantly&#xD;
      higher in patients who later had an ongoing pregnancy (28 ng/ml) than those who did not have&#xD;
      an ongoing pregnancy (16.4 ng/ml) with a p-value of 0.039. They did however conclude, that&#xD;
      further investigation is needed for the individualization of intramuscular progesterone doses&#xD;
      to reach optimal pregnancy rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, more attention has been given recently to measuring serum progesterone during HRT FET&#xD;
      cycles. Kofinas et al., 2015 suggested that progesterone levels &gt;20 ng/ml (possibly due to an&#xD;
      escape ovulation and subsequent embryo-endometrial asynchrony) on the day of transfer have&#xD;
      been associated with decreased ongoing pregnancy and live birth rates. On the other hand,&#xD;
      Yovich, et al., 2015 proposed an optimal mid-luteal progesterone range between 22 and 31&#xD;
      ng/ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most recently, Labarta et al., 2017 investigated the relationship between serum progesterone&#xD;
      levels on the day of embryo transfer (ET) and ongoing pregnancy rate (OPR). Their study&#xD;
      recommended a minimum serum progesterone threshold (9.2 ng/ml) to optimize OPR in artificial&#xD;
      cycles using transvaginal progesterone and this value could theoretically be used to decide&#xD;
      if ET should be postponed or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extrapolating from this data, we intend to investigate whether intramuscular progesterone&#xD;
      supplementation can help improve OPR rates in the aforementioned patients with decreased&#xD;
      serum progesterone on the day of ET. In other words, we intend to investigate further the&#xD;
      concept of individualizing luteal phase support in HRT FET cycles.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Patients undergoing frozen cycles following ICSI will receive artificial endometrial preparation from day 2/3 of their cycle in the form of 2mg Estradiol Valerate pills thrice daily for 7-10 days. After confirming endometrial thickness &gt; 7mm via TVS, progesterone supplementation will start via Prontogest® 400mg vaginal pessaries twice daily for 5 days, ending with the day of embryo transfer (ET).&#xD;
On the morning of ET, serum progesterone will be measured and if the value is over 9.2ng/ml, only the traditional twice daily vaginal progesterone will be resumed until 12 weeks gestation. If the value is under 9.2 ng/ml, intramuscular progesterone supplementation with Prontogest® 100mg will be added in twice-weekly doses (every 3 days) to the vaginal supplementation.&#xD;
Quantitative β-hcg 2 weeks after ET to detect chemical pregnancies. Ultrasound 4 weeks after ET to detect clinical pregnancies. Ultrasound repeated at 12 weeks to confirm ongoing pregnancy rates.</intervention_model_description>
