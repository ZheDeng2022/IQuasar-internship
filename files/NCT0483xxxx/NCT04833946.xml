      Sponsor aimed to study hydroalcoholic extract of Andrographis paniculata (for its effect on&#xD;
      OA disease progression in OA patients with moderate to severe knee OA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hydroalcoholic extract of Andrographis paniculata (standardized for 50% bioactive&#xD;
      andrographolides). It has been evaluated in clinical studies for its anti-inflammatory and&#xD;
      anti-oxidant activities. Although the potential cartilage regenerative mechanism of&#xD;
      Andrographis paniculata is unknown, Sponsor believe that Andrographis paniculata may have an&#xD;
      effect on increasing the expression of collagen type II protein and also mitigate the&#xD;
      migration of inflammatory cells or angiogenesis. In the present study, knee morphometrics&#xD;
      (joint space narrowing of tibiofemoral joint, and cartilage thickness at the femur, tibia and&#xD;
      patella compartments), cartilage turnover (serum COMP levels), bone turnover (serum Bone&#xD;
      specific alkaline phosphatase) along with symptomatic relief (Using mWOMAC) in patients with&#xD;
      primary knee OA over a period of 336 days will be evaluated.&#xD;
