  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, single centre, prospective, randomized, alternating panels, ascending&#xD;
      doses with interspersed placebo, double-blind, crossover trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will include 8 volunteers divided into 2 panels (A and B) investigated in&#xD;
      alternance, each submitted to 4 investigation periods following a crossover design in double&#xD;
      blind, with ascending intravenous doses of MDPK67b and an interspersed placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ascending dose sequence ranges from 2 to 48 mg, with 2-fold increase steps (3 to 4- fold&#xD;
      increase steps in each individual volunteer). Three single doses will be administered at a&#xD;
      minimum of 2 weeks intervals during the first 3 periods, and finally during the last period 4&#xD;
      repeated doses will be administered at a three days intervals, using either the highest dose&#xD;
      of the ascending sequence (i.e. 24 or 48 mg) or the maximal tolerated dose (if it has been&#xD;
      exceeded in the ascending sequence of single doses).&#xD;
