  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project aims at assessing the role of radio-guided surgery in the detection of lymph node&#xD;
      invasion (LNI) in prostate cancer (PCa) patients undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP) by&#xD;
      using an intraoperative gamma probe and a radioactive labelled PSMA ligand (99mTc-PSMA-I&amp;S).&#xD;
      We hypothesize that 99mTc-PSMA-I&amp;S radio-guided surgery (99mTc-PSMA-RGS) might assist&#xD;
      physicians in the identification of patients with LNI candidate for an extended pelvic lymph&#xD;
      node dissection (ePLND). Overall, 100 men with a LNI risk &gt;5% according to the Briganti&#xD;
      nomogram will be submitted to 68Ga-PSMA PET/MRI followed by 99mTc-PSMA-RGS and ePLND. The&#xD;
      aims are 1) to assess the safety and tolerability of 99mTc-PSMA-I&amp;S; 2) to assess the&#xD;
      accuracy of 99mTc-PSMA-RGS in the identification of LNI compared to available clinical tools&#xD;
      and to molecular imaging (i.e., 68Ga-PSMA PET/MRI); 3) to assess whether 99mTc-PSMA-RGS would&#xD;
      allow for the identification of positive nodes outside the standard ePLND template.&#xD;

      Potential participants will be identified, screened and recruited by the Urologists working&#xD;
      at the Department of Urology, IRCCS San Raffaele, Milan, Italy. A total of 100 patients&#xD;
      affected by PCa with a risk of LNI &gt;5% according to the Briganti nomogram and planned to&#xD;
      receive RARP with an ePLND according to the European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines&#xD;
      will be identified and enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient must personally sign and date the latest approved version of the Informed Consent&#xD;
      Form (ICF) before any trial specific procedures are performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written and verbal versions of the Patient Information and Informed Consent will be presented&#xD;
      to the participants detailing no less than:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The exact nature of the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The surgical procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The implications and constraints of the protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The known side effects and any risks involved in taking part&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The clear statement that the participant is free to withdraw from the trial at any time&#xD;
           for any reason without prejudice to future care, and with no obligation to give the&#xD;
           reason for withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant will be allowed as much time as wished to consider the information and the&#xD;
      opportunity to question the Investigator, their GP or other independent parties to decide&#xD;
      whether they will participate in the trial. Written Informed Consent will then be obtained by&#xD;
      means of participant dated signature and dated signature of the person who presented and&#xD;
      obtained the Informed Consent. The person who obtained the consent must be suitably qualified&#xD;
      and experienced, and have been authorized to do so by the Principal Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A copy of the signed Informed Consent will be given to the participant. The original signed&#xD;
      form will be retained at the trial Centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Patient ID number will be assigned to each patient after the ICF signature: this number&#xD;
      corresponds to the Progressive Number assigned in chronological order beginning from 001&#xD;
      (i.e. 001, 002, etc.). For instance, the first patient enrolled will receive the following ID&#xD;
      Number: 001.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Visit 1, the following data will be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographics&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compliance with inclusion/exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Previous &amp; concomitant pathologies/previous significant surgeries (including the&#xD;
           Charlson Comorbidity Index)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Previous &amp; concomitant medications&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prostate cancer characteristics including PSA values, biopsy grade group, clinical stage&#xD;
           and the risk of LNI calculated according to the Briganti nomogram [12]&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vital signs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Laboratory testing (absolute neutrophil count; platelets; haemoglobin; serum creatinine)&#xD;
           The week before surgery patients will undergo a 68Ga-PSMA PET/MRI or PET/CT scan for&#xD;
           preoperative staging. Simultaneous PET/MRI will start 60 minutes after the&#xD;
           administration of approximately 160MBq of PSMA with the following protocol: localizer&#xD;
           MRI scans to define the number of table positions (PET-FOV) to acquire (4-min/table&#xD;
           position); specific attenuation correction and anatomical localization MR sequences at&#xD;
           each PET-FOV; pelvic mpMRI protocol according to European Society of Urogenital&#xD;
           Radiology guidelines. A positive 68Ga-PSMA PET/MRI will be defined as the presence of&#xD;
           any uptake at the level of the pelvic and/or retroperitoneal nodes. The results of this&#xD;
           procedure will not change the initially planned treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           99mTc-PSMA-I&amp;S will be intravenously injected the day before surgery (day -1).&#xD;
           99mTc-PSMA-I&amp;S will be prepared using a synthesis kit previously described [25].&#xD;
           SPECT/CT imaging will be performed the same day of treatment administration (day -1) to&#xD;
           document positive tracer uptake and will serve as quality control for tracer injection&#xD;
           and distribution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All procedures will be performed through a trans-peritoneal approach using the Da Vinci Xi&#xD;
      (Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) robotic Surgical System. The patient will be placed&#xD;
      in a Trendelenburg position. After incision of the peritoneum, release of the bladder&#xD;
      laterally to the endopelvic fascia, the ureter will be localized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A drop-in gamma probe will be used for in vivo intraoperative measurements to identify&#xD;
      metastatic lesions at the level of the internal iliac, external iliac, obturatory and common&#xD;
      iliac stations. A positive finding at PSMA-RGS will be defined as the presence of a count&#xD;
      rate of at least twice as compared to the background reference (namely, fatty tissue of each&#xD;
      patient). All positive lesions (a count rate of at least twice as compared to the background&#xD;
      reference) will be excised. Ex vivo gamma measurements will be performed to immediately to&#xD;
      confirm the removal of the radioactive lesion or to prompt further search in case of a&#xD;
      missing signal. All the removed tissue will be collected separately according to the site of&#xD;
      resection.&#xD;
