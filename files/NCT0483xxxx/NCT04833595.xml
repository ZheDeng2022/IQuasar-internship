  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to explore the effectiveness of mindful eating and its effect on cholesterol&#xD;
      and glucose level. The participants will be required to get tested for their fasting total&#xD;
      cholesterol and blood glucose level for two times. At the first visit, they will be required&#xD;
      to complete the survey given and be tested for their fasting total cholesterol and blood&#xD;
      glucose level. A recommendation on healthy food intake will be sent to participants. At the&#xD;
      end of each week, participants will be required 1) to submit THREE photos of the meals that&#xD;
      they are most satisfied with in terms of healthiness and 2) using the photos to answer a&#xD;
      questionnaire about their diet. The photos and completed questionnaire must be submitted to&#xD;
      the research investigator each week for a total of 8 weeks. After 8 weeks, participants will&#xD;
      be required to get tested for their fasting total cholesterol and blood glucose level in the&#xD;
      appointed pharmacy for the second time. It is estimated to require 15-30 minutes of their&#xD;
      time weekly.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Consistently high cholesterol or/and glucose level pose harmful threat to the body that may&#xD;
      cause lethal health conditions (e.g. stroke, cardiovascular diseases). In addition, 3.6&#xD;
      million Malaysians are suffering from diabetes, the highest rate of incidence in Asia and one&#xD;
      of the highest in the world. There is crucial need to find ways to improve the situation.&#xD;
      Tele-health interventions and mindful eating behaviours are proposed to be effective in&#xD;
      improving the levels of cholesterol and glucose. To investigate and explore the intervention,&#xD;
      a small-scale randomised controlled trial will be conducted by comparing the effectiveness of&#xD;
      mindful eating and the effect on cholesterol and glucose level. Students will collect and&#xD;
      analyse both quantitative and qualitative data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A small-scale randomised controlled trial will be conducted to compare the effectiveness of&#xD;
      mindful eating and the effect on lipid level. Subjects will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      intervention or control group. For intervention group, subjects will be required to snap&#xD;
      picture of every meal that they consume. At the end of the day, they are required to actively&#xD;
      recall and reflect on how healthy they consider their meals to be. The reflection will be&#xD;
      submitted to the research team daily together with the taken pictures of meal. As for the&#xD;
      control group, subjects will only snap and submit the picture of their meals but without&#xD;
      active recall and reflection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects are required to return to the community pharmacy after two months to follow-up on&#xD;
      their glucose and lipid levels post intervention.&#xD;
