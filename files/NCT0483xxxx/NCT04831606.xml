  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot case/control clinical study on a group of outpatients with diabetic foot&#xD;
      lesions aiming to verify the efficacy and safety of the Blue light photobiomodulation therapy&#xD;
      with EmoLED medical device, in addition to standard therapy compared to the standard therapy&#xD;
      alone, evaluating the percentage of healed lesions (which have reached complete and lasting&#xD;
      re-epithelialization), the evaluation of the healing time and reduction of the ulcerated area&#xD;
      during the time of observation, the perception of pain and the quality of life of the&#xD;
      enrolled patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is therefore to determine any differences in outcome between the two&#xD;
      groups considered and, in particular, if the therapy of the group being treated is more&#xD;
      effective than the standard therapy in terms of percentage of healed lesions, healing time,&#xD;
      and reduction of the ulcerated area, pain perception, and quality of life, and is at least as&#xD;
      safe in terms of occurrence of adverse events.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted according to the standards of Good Clinical Practice and in&#xD;
      compliance with the principles set out in the Declaration of Helsinki, with the&#xD;
      UNI_ISO_14155_2011 standard, and with all relevant local laws and regulations applicable to&#xD;
      clinical trials that use patients as the research object. This clinical investigation in the&#xD;
      various centers involved cannot begin before having received the favorable written approval&#xD;
      of the Ethics Committee of the coordinating center and the respective Ethics Committees. The&#xD;
      medical assistance provided to the subject is the responsibility of adequately qualified&#xD;
      doctors, as all the centers involved in this study are centers specialized in the treatment&#xD;
      of the pathology object of the clinical trial (Diabetology units or Diabetic Foot clinics).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this trial, the patients' right to physical and mental integrity, the right to&#xD;
      privacy, and the protection of data concerning them will be respected following Directive&#xD;
      95/46/EC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical investigation has been designed in such a way as to cause as little pain,&#xD;
      discomfort, fear, and other foreseeable risks for the subject as possible and the degree of&#xD;
      discomfort related to the trial itself or the treatment with the medical device in question&#xD;
      is almost nil, considered the clinical evaluation report of the device and the safety data&#xD;
      obtained from post-marketing surveillance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The degree of discomfort/pain of the enrolled patients is however subject to continuous&#xD;
      verification during the clinical trial, through a special questionnaire on the detection of&#xD;
      discomfort connected to participation in the study in question. The risk/benefit ratio will&#xD;
      be constantly checked throughout the trial, taking into account any adverse events /&#xD;
      device-related accidents or non-serious side effects reported by the main investigators, and&#xD;
      the preliminary assessment of the benefits found on patients who have completed the study&#xD;
      process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal investigator of each center is responsible for adequate conduct of the study of&#xD;
      his own center and the coordination of the personnel involved. Must be responsible for all&#xD;
      medical decisions relating to the study and ensure that adequate medical assistance is&#xD;
      provided to the subject in case of adverse events. The investigator should conduct the study&#xD;
      following the protocol agreed with the sponsor and the authorities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To verify that the rights, safety, and well-being of enrolled patients are protected, that&#xD;
      the data communicated are reliable and solid, and that the clinical investigation is&#xD;
      conducted in compliance with the prescriptions of current legislation, the sponsor guarantees&#xD;
      adequate monitoring of the conduct of this clinical investigation. The monitoring of the&#xD;
      clinical investigation is entrusted to the sponsor's staff adequately trained. To ensure&#xD;
      compliance with ICH/GCP guidelines and current legislation, such personnel will be&#xD;
      responsible for ensuring that the Study is conducted in full compliance with the Standard&#xD;
      Operating Procedures, the Protocol, and other written instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main responsibilities of the personnel carrying out the monitoring are to ensure&#xD;
      adherence to the Protocol, to ensure that data is recorded and reported accurately and&#xD;
      completely, and to verify that informed consent has been obtained and recorded for all&#xD;
      subjects before they participate in the study. Researchers will be contacted at regular&#xD;
      intervals throughout the study period. To check and verify the various documents (Data&#xD;
      Collection Cards or CRFs and other relevant documents containing the original data) relating&#xD;
      to the Study to verify compliance with the Protocol and to ensure the completeness,&#xD;
      consistency, and accuracy of the recorded data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring staff will conduct a center opening visit (SIV), a minimum of three visits during&#xD;
      the study (MOV) to be scheduled approximately one after 1 or 2 months after SIV based on the&#xD;
      number of patients enrolled, one at two-thirds of the enrollment and another after the&#xD;
      observations on the last patient. Finally, once all the open issues have been resolved (open&#xD;
      queries, clarifications, etc.), we will proceed with the center closing visit (COV). Should&#xD;
      additional monitoring visits be necessary, the staff will schedule them with the principal&#xD;
      investigator.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>A double-blind pilot trial on outpatients affected by diabetic foot ulcers, followed in an integrated way by both a specialized center and the home nursing network, for a period of 24 weeks.&#xD;
The specialist center will characterize the patient, set the therapy, and evaluate them monthly, the nursing service will treat them at home biweekly.&#xD;
The physician in charge of the monthly evaluation is unaware of the patient's arm. During therapy, the patient will wear blinding glasses, the control arm will simulate the use of the device switching it on without aiming it at the wound.&#xD;
After a two-week pre-enrollment period to evaluate the wound progression applying only the standard care (if the wound reduces 50% or more, the patient will be excluded), the patient will be randomized into one of the study arms: the control arm will continue with the standard treatment, while the EmoLED Arm will receive EmoLED's therapy in addition to the standard treatment.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Triple (Participant, Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>Patients will be randomized into the two arms of the study according to a list of random numbers generated by special IT tools and communicated by the scientific supervisor to the Care Provider via e-mail .&#xD;
It is a 1: 1, single-block randomization of 40 patients distributed in the two groups (treated and control). After the two-week enrollment observation period, the Investigator at the outpatient center will ascertains the conditions for the study prosecution and will notify the Head of the Care Providers to take charge of the patient included in the study and to proceed with the assignment to one of the groups. In this way, the Investigator at the outpatient center will be blinded to the treatment performed at home by the patient.&#xD;
All patients will receive a pair of blinding glasses at the enrollment and will be required to wear them during therapy.</masking_description>
