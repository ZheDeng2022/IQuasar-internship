    <textblock>
      Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is one of the common anatomic causes of blindness among&#xD;
      Filipinos, accounting for 47.7% of the cases. With this retinopathy being preventable and&#xD;
      treatable, ROP screening has been proven to be effective in preventing blindness, which is&#xD;
      achieved with the usage of mydriatics. Even if the regimen of multiple alternate&#xD;
      instillations of 0.5% tropicamide and 2.5% phenylephrine is the one recommended by&#xD;
      international guidelines for ROP screening, the mydriatic regimen used by many of the&#xD;
      country's institutions is the single instillation of 0.5% tropicamide + 0.5% phenylephrine&#xD;
      applied via a cotton wick placed in the inferior fornix (SIW). There have been no studies yet&#xD;
      on the safety and efficacy in premature infants of this mydriatic preparation and method,&#xD;
      although it is hypothesized that the usage of a cotton wick promotes the possible systemic&#xD;
      effects of the mydriatic combination used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study then aims to determine the safety and efficacy of different mydriatic regimens in&#xD;
      premature infants referred for screening of ROP using (1) multiple alternate instillations of&#xD;
      0.5% cyclopentolate hydrochloride and 2.5% phenylephrine (MAI), (2) single instillation of&#xD;
      0.5% tropicamide + 0.5% phenylephrine (SI), and (3) single instillation of 0.5% tropicamide +&#xD;
      0.5% phenylephrine with a cotton wick placed in the inferior fornix (SIW) in a tertiary&#xD;
      Philippine hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was designed as a randomized, double blind, clinical study which enrolled sixty&#xD;
      preterm infants referred for ROP Screening from January to July 2011. With instillations via&#xD;
      MAI, SI, and SIW, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic pressure (DBP), mean arterial&#xD;
      pressure (MAP), heart rate, and oxygen saturation were monitored from ten minutes prior to&#xD;
      instillation up to forty-five minutes after instillation. Pupil dilations were also measured&#xD;
      at the forty-fifth minute.&#xD;

      I. Introduction Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is one of the common anatomic causes of&#xD;
      blindness among Filipinos, accounting for 47.7% of the cases. With this retinopathy being&#xD;
      preventable and treatable, ROP screening has been proven to be effective in preventing&#xD;
      blindness, which is achieved with the usage of mydriatics. Even if the regimen of multiple&#xD;
      alternate instillations of 0.5% tropicamide and 2.5% phenylephrine is the one recommended by&#xD;
      international guidelines for ROP screening, the mydriatic regimen usually used by many of the&#xD;
      country's institutions is the regimen of 0.5% tropicamide + 0.5% phenylephrine applied via a&#xD;
      cotton wick placed in the inferior fornix. There have been no studies yet on the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy in premature infants of this mydriatic preparation and method, although it is&#xD;
      hypothesized that the usage of a cotton wick promotes the possible systemic effects of the&#xD;
      mydriatic combination used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Significance It is the aim of this study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the&#xD;
      mydriatic regimens we use in our institution and compare it to the recommendation by the UK&#xD;
      ROP Guidelines. In doing so, this study aims to (1) document vital sign changes in the infant&#xD;
      during dilation, (2) identify adverse systemic changes due to the mydriatic regimen and (3)&#xD;
      provide appropriate interventions and recommendations to address these adverse effects. These&#xD;
      will greatly improve the ROP screening process in our institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Objectives The general objective is to determine vital sign changes related to Pupil&#xD;
      Dilation among preterm infants referred for ROP Screening from Neonatal Intensive Care Unit,&#xD;
      Pediatric Wards and Eye Instrumentation Center of the Philippine General Hospital (PGH).&#xD;
      Specifically, its objective is to compare the vital sign changes and mydriasis in (1)&#xD;
      multiple alternate instillations of 0.5% Cyclopentolate Hydrochloride + 2.5% Phenylephrine&#xD;
      (MAI) (2) single instillation of 0.5%/0.5% Phenylephrine + Tropicamide (SI) and (3) single&#xD;
      instillation of 0.5%/0.5% Phenylephrine + Tropicamide with a cotton wick placed in the&#xD;
      inferior fornix (SIW).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Methodology This study was designed as a randomized, double blind, clinical study which&#xD;
      enrolled sixty preterm infants referred for ROP Screening from January to July 2011. Each&#xD;
      subject was randomly distributed into the standard, instillation, and packing group. To avoid&#xD;
      observer bias, two investigators were involved per monitoring during dilation. The first&#xD;
      investigator was assigned only to place the monitoring devices and to administer the&#xD;
      mydriatics contained in unmarked 1 mL syringe which content was unknown to him.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vital signs monitored during dilation were blood pressures (systolic, diastolic and mean&#xD;
      arterial pressure (MAP)), heart rates and oxygen saturations using the newly calibrated&#xD;
      Phillips Digital IntelliVue MP20 junior Cardiac monitors. A digital camera and a millimeter&#xD;
      rule were used to approximate size of pupil dilatation. Measurement of all the vital signs&#xD;
      and pupil dilation from a subject was derived from a single dilation session only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to data collection up to the end of monitoring, other factors that may affect the vital&#xD;
      signs of the preterm infants were addressed. This included hunger, cold temperature, and&#xD;
      soiled diapers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline vital signs determination was then performed 10 and 5 minutes prior to the first&#xD;
      drop of mydriatic or proparacaine prior to packing. Additional reading will be done if there&#xD;
      is a significant difference in the vital signs between 10 and 5 minutes prior to the initial&#xD;
      drop.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the MAI, multiple alternate drops of 0.5% cyclopentolate then 2.5% phenylephrine every 5&#xD;
      minutes in two doses were instilled (total of 0.2 milliliter of 0.5% cyclopentolate and 0.2&#xD;
      millimeter of 2.5% Phenylephrine). Vital signs were continuously recorded at time 0, 5, 10,&#xD;
      15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40 and 45. At the 45th minute, a lid retractor was placed in the eyes of&#xD;
      the subject after a drop of topical anesthesia. Pictures of the eyes were taken with a&#xD;
      millimeter rule to serve as measurement reference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the SI, only a drop of 0.5%/0.5% tropicamide + phenylephrine was properly instilled at&#xD;
      time 0 (total of 0.1 milliliter). Vital signs were continuously recorded at time 0, 5, 10,&#xD;
      15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40 and 45. At the 45th minute, a lid retractor was placed in the eyes of&#xD;
      the subject after a drop of topical anesthesia. Pictures of the eyes were taken with a&#xD;
      millimeter rule to serve as measurement reference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the SIW, a cotton wisp soaked with a drop of 0.5%/0.5% tropicamide + phenylephrine was&#xD;
      placed on the lower fornix in each eye of the infant (total of 0.1 milliliter). The weight of&#xD;
      the cotton wisp was standardized at 0.02 milligram using a digital weighing scale. Vital&#xD;
      signs were continuously recorded at time 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40 and 45. At the 45th&#xD;
      minute, a lid retractor is placed in the eyes of the subject after a drop of topical&#xD;
      anesthesia. Pictures of the eyes were taken with a millimeter rule to serve as measurement&#xD;
      reference. Pictures were uploaded into the computer monitor for the actual measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vital sign changes were monitored using the newly calibrated Phillips Digital IntelliVue MP20&#xD;
      junior Cardiac monitors. In the presence of significant vital sign changes, immediate&#xD;
      intervention will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the presence of a significant increase in BP or heart rate, the infant will be observed.&#xD;
      Both changes are expected from undergoing a stressful procedure such as placing a lid&#xD;
      retractor in measuring the pupil dilation. The infant will be referred to the NICU ROD for&#xD;
      further work up should tachycardia persist even after the examination. The blood pressure,&#xD;
      heart rate and sensorium will be continuously monitored so as to avoid any ensuing&#xD;
      bradycardia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the presence of a significant drop in BP, the infant will be referred to the NICU ROD for&#xD;
      further work up to determine the possible source. Fluid challenge will be done to check if&#xD;
      the cause of hypotension is just attributable to hypovolemia. The investigator will determine&#xD;
      body temperature to check for hypothermia. If hypothermic, slow rewarming will be done by&#xD;
      placing back the infant inside a close incubator or beside a radiant warmer. Blood glucose&#xD;
      will be checked for hypoglycemia. Should hyperglycemia be detected, the infant can be started&#xD;
      on 2cc/kg D5water. Infant will be worked up for infection as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During events of hypoxia or oxygen desaturation of less than 85%, the infant will be given&#xD;
      supportive ventilation as required. Oxygen saturation will be monitored using the pulse&#xD;
      oximeter. In the event of an apnea happening, supportive ventilation will be provided&#xD;
      immediately, together with significant stimulation. The infant will be referred to the NICU&#xD;
      ROD for possible intubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event of bradycardia, significant stimulation will be started on the infant. The&#xD;
      infant will be referred to the NICU ROD for further work-up to determine the cause. The&#xD;
      investigator is also to determine body temperature to check for hypothermia. If hypothermic,&#xD;
      slow rewarming will be done by placing back the infant inside a close incubator or beside a&#xD;
      radiant warmer. Blood glucose will be determined to check for hypoglycemia. Should&#xD;
      hyperglycemia be detected, the infant can be started on 2cc/kg D5water. Infant can be worked&#xD;
      up for infection as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event that a subject suffers from any of the abovementioned adverse effects, the&#xD;
      appropriate interventions cited will be administered free of charge. Should the adverse&#xD;
      effects believed by the investigators to be secondary to the ROP screening only and&#xD;
      additional expenses are needed to procure medicines or equipment, the investigators will&#xD;
      shoulder the expenses. If the medicine or equipment is immediately needed, the relative may&#xD;
      spend first for them and have the expenses reimbursed with the investigators later. Should&#xD;
      the amount to procure the said medicine or equipment cannot be produced by the relative, the&#xD;
      investigators can be immediately contacted to assist the relatives immediately. All other&#xD;
      expenses will be shouldered by the investigators through reimbursements. Expenses amounting&#xD;
      to P500 for the medicine and P1000 for the equipment will be shouldered by the investigators.&#xD;
      Should it exceed these limits, the infant will be referred to any charitable institution for&#xD;
      further assistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blood pressure (systole, diastole and MAP), HR and oxygen saturation obtained during&#xD;
      dilatation were analyzed. They were graphed to determine patterns from baseline up to 45&#xD;
      minutes. Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to assess statistical significance for oxygen&#xD;
      saturation, being a non-parametric variable. Poor dilatation among ROP patients with the&#xD;
      advanced disease will be noted. A subgroup analysis was also done to determine the any&#xD;
      relationship between the amounts of mydriatic used to the weight of the infant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An interim analysis was done within the study to assess if the two mydriatic regimens were&#xD;
      particularly beneficial or harmful compared to the concurrent standard group. Either the&#xD;
      Pocock or the Flemming method will be used to decide if this study needed to terminate&#xD;
      earlier than planned. Unblinding can be done should it be made necessary during the interim&#xD;
      analysis or during course of the study. This protocol was submitted to the PGH ERB for ethics&#xD;
      review and approval. It was conducted only upon approval from the ERB. All patient&#xD;
      information were anonymized and are confidential. There is no funding received by the&#xD;
      investigators for the conduct of this research.&#xD;
