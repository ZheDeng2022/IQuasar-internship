  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to understand how TAK-994 is processed by the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will require participants to stay at the clinical research unit for 3 weeks to be&#xD;
      monitored after receiving TAK-994.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-994. TAK-994 is being tested in healthy&#xD;
      male participants. This study will characterize how TAK -994 is absorbed, metabolize,&#xD;
      excreted by the body, after single oral administration by collecting plasma, urine, and feces&#xD;
      samples for testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 6 participants. The study consists of 2 parts: Part A and&#xD;
      Part B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part A, all participants will receive TAK-994 as tablet and [14C]TAK-994 as intravenous&#xD;
      infusion. In Part B, all participants will receive a single dose of [14C]TAK-994 as an oral&#xD;
      suspension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This single-center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to&#xD;
      participate in this study is approximately 67 days, including a 28-day screening period plus&#xD;
      approximately 30 days for follow up.&#xD;
