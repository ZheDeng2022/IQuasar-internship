  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease(PD) may cause the autonomic nervous system's improper functioning, which&#xD;
      is responsible for regulating the intestinal tract movement. A certain degree of degeneration&#xD;
      of digestive system function can cause PD patients to constipation symptoms. Studies have&#xD;
      shown that up to 63 percent of people with Parkinson's disease experience constipation. What&#xD;
      is more, medications for PD, including levodopa and dopamine agonist, can also cause&#xD;
      constipation. In recent years, an increasing number of studies have been conducted to&#xD;
      investigate gut microflora and their influence on the central nervous system. Furthermore,&#xD;
      some studies of Parkinson's disease have confirmed that gut microflora plays a vital role in&#xD;
      the occurrence and development of Parkinson's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of fecal microbiota&#xD;
      transplantation in the treatment of constipation symptoms in patients with Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease receiving a steady dose of levodopa. We will also analyze intestinal flora diversity&#xD;
      in patients with Parkinson's disease with constipation. The investigation of the gut&#xD;
      microbiome may emerge as a new therapeutic measure to treat constipation associate with&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease.&#xD;

    <measure>The Efficacy of FMT in patients with constipation will be assessed by the change of The Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) and Wexner Constipation Score.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The data will be collected in several time points from baseline to 6 months after FMT. Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale(GSRS) is a measure of gastrointestinal symptom severity in five clusters (pain, bloating, constipation, diarrhea, and early satiety).The items are scored between 1 and 7, where 1 corresponds to &quot;no discomfort at all&quot; and 7 to &quot;very severe discomfort&quot; from the symptom.&#xD;
Wexner Constipation Scoring system is a scale to evaluate the severity of constipation. These factors included frequency of bowel movements, painful evacuation, incomplete evacuation, abdominal pain, length of time per attempt, assistance for evacuation, unsuccessful attempts for evacuation per 24 hours, and duration of constipation, with 0 indicating normal and 30 indicating severe constipation.</description>
