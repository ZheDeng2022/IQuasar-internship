  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diarrhoea is the one of the top five leading causes of death among children below the age of&#xD;
      five years, globally. It is estimated that one in ten deaths in children under five is&#xD;
      attributed to diarrhoea. Enterotoxigenic E.coli (ETEC) is one of the major causative agents&#xD;
      of moderate-to-severe (MSD) diarrhoea among children both globally and in Zambia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall aim of this study is to document the burden of ETEC associated diarrhoea in&#xD;
      Zambian children under 3 years of age.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to determine diarrhoea aetiology, calculate the incidence of&#xD;
      moderate-to-severe ETEC-associated diarrhea, and describe the frequency of ETEC colonization&#xD;
      factors and enterotoxin types in children under 3 years old in Zambia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These data are required for the design of an anticipated phase 3 trial of the leading ETEC&#xD;
      vaccine (ETVAX®) that will be evaluated in Zambia from 2021 onwards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following are the research questions that this study seeks to answer:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. What is the incidence of MSD with confirmed ETEC aetiology in children under three years&#xD;
           old in Zambia?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. What are the prevalent colonization toxins and factors (CFs) in diarrhoeagenic isolates&#xD;
           of ETEC infections in children in Zambia?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. What are the other common pathogens causing diarrhoea in Zambian children?&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective, observational, longitudinal study is proposed at five health facilities in&#xD;
      Lusaka. The proposed study sites are Chawama, George, Kanyama, Chainda, and Matero Health&#xD;
      Facilities. These facilities are located within typical peri-urban settlements of Lusaka and&#xD;
      serves communities with a cumulative total population of over 1 million people. The study&#xD;
      will be done in two stages beginning with a household census in the study catchment area of&#xD;
      the participating health facilities and then followed by the passive diarrhoea surveillance&#xD;
      stage. A surveillance system for passive case detection of diarrhoea will be set up at each&#xD;
      facility for the 12-months of the project to detect any seasonal variations of disease&#xD;
      burden. Prior to commencement, several community sensitization activities will be conducted&#xD;
      within the catchment areas of the health facility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A stool sample will be collected from each participant who presents to the health facility&#xD;
      and is eligible for enrollment. All research samples will be collected at the study site and&#xD;
      laboratory assays will be performed as per written SOPs and will be a part of the study&#xD;
      documentation. All the samples will be processed in Zambia using the Novodiag® platform. The&#xD;
      Novodiag® (Mobidiag Ltd, Finland) is a novel multiplex molecular platform that is based on&#xD;
      real-time PCR and microarray technology and can identify various gastroenteritis causing&#xD;
      bacteria, parasites and viruses as well as carry out antimicrobial resistance gene testing of&#xD;
      organisms.&#xD;

        This study is a multi-site longitudinal observation study, to be conducted at Matero First&#xD;
        Level Hospital, Chawama First Level Hospital, George Clinic, Kanyama First Level Hospital&#xD;
        and Chainda clinic in Lusaka. The facilities are situated in a typical peri-urban&#xD;
        settlement area of Lusaka and serves a community with a combined population of about 1&#xD;
        million. We assume that all sites have similar incidence of ETEC diarrhoea, therefore, each&#xD;
        of the 5 sites will enroll 1350 children bringing our total sample size for the study to&#xD;
        6,750 participants.&#xD;
