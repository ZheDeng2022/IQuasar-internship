  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Food and their components are often reported as gastrointestinal (GI) symptom triggers in&#xD;
      patients with IBS. The current interest in dietary management in IBS, has largely focused on&#xD;
      the negative effect of poorly absorbed and subsequently fermented carbohydrates (FODMAP -&#xD;
      Fermentable Oligo-, Di-, Mono-saccharides And Polyols). These unabsorbed carbohydrates can&#xD;
      generate GI symptoms through osmosis, with increased amount of fluid in the gut lumen, and&#xD;
      via modification of gut microbiota composition and function (fermentation and production of&#xD;
      gas).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies assessing diets low in FODMAPs have shown promising results in symptom improvement in&#xD;
      some IBS patients, but not in all. The low FODMAP diet, as it is used today, is restrictive&#xD;
      and difficult for patients to accommodate in their daily life. Moreover, the effect of this&#xD;
      diet on microbiota composition and function is not defined, and there are also concerns that&#xD;
      restrictive diets may lead to nutritional inadequacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fructan is a specific FODMAP which is built of fructose polymers. Examples of foods that&#xD;
      contain fructans are wheat, onion, garlic and banana. The daily dietary intake of fructans&#xD;
      varies approximately between 3 and 6 grams. Fructans are potential triggers of GI symptoms in&#xD;
      IBS however, they are currently also used as prebiotic supplements. A recent systematic&#xD;
      review and meta-analysis concluded that low dosages of fructans do not worsen GI symptoms,&#xD;
      but they do increase the beneficial bifidobacteria. It remains unclear whether the potential&#xD;
      benefits of fructans outweigh the potential harmful effects in patients with IBS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are aiming to assess the effects of fructans, as well as predictive factors&#xD;
      and mechanisms involved, and to compare with placebo in IBS patients. The investigators will&#xD;
      assess GI symptom severity, visceral sensitivity, intestinal gas production, gut immunity and&#xD;
      microbiota, and metabolites produced in the gut.&#xD;

    <description>change in Gastrointestinal symptom rating scale-IBS (GSRS-IBS) between the 2 groups. GSRS-IBS assesses five GI symptom domains: satiety, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation and bloating. The five domains are calculated using the mean of two to four items scored with 7-point Likert scales, with higher scores representing more severe symptoms.</description>

    <description>change in Hospital Anxiety and depression scale (HAD) between the 2 groups. HAD assesses the severity of psychological distress, i.e. anxiety and depression. In this 14-item scale, seven items measure anxiety and the other seven measure depression on a 4-point Likert scale (0-3) which provides a score between 0 (absence) and 21 (high level). Scores higher than 10 on each of the subscales is considered to define clinically relevant anxiety and/or depression.</description>

VSI is a 15-item validated scale measuring GI symptom-specific anxiety, i.e. the cognitive, affective, and behavioural response to fear of GI sensations, symptoms, and the context in which these occur. The total score ranges between 0 (no GI-specific anxiety) to 75 (severe GI-specific anxiety).</description>

    <description>change in irritable bowel syndrome quality of life (IBSQOL) questionnaire between the 2 groups. IBSQOL is a disease-specific, self-administered questionnaire, with 30 items measuring nine aspects of health-related quality of life during the past four weeks. The nine domains are emotional health, mental health, sleep, energy, physical functioning, food/diet, social role, physical role and sexual relations. Each question has five or six response options. For each subscale, the score is transformed to a 0-100 scale. A higher score represents a better quality of life.</description>

    <time_frame>between baseline, after the low FODMAP diet (14 days) and after reintroduction (7+/-3 days)</time_frame>
    <description>change in patient health questionnaire 12 (PHQ12) between the 2 groups. The PHQ-15 is a somatic symptom subscale derived from the full PHQ. It inquires about 15 somatic symptoms; each individual symptom is coded as 0, 1, or 2, and the total score ranges from 0 to 30, with higher scores representing more severe symptoms.</description>
