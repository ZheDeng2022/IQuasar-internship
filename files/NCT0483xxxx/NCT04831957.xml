  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aortic stenosis is highly prevalent in advancing age. The prognosis of this disease has&#xD;
      dramatically changed with the surgical replacement of the aortic valve and the trans catheter&#xD;
      aortic valve re-placement (TAVI). The TAVI procedure is also successful in octogenarians and&#xD;
      frail patients. However, the evaluation before the TAVI procedure requires a high dosage of&#xD;
      iodinated contrast agent with, consequently, an increased risk for thyroid dysfunction. The&#xD;
      primary endpoint of this study is to assess, prospectively, the incidence and the predictive&#xD;
      factors (underlying thyroid disease, medication, food preservative, topical antiseptics) of&#xD;
      hypothyroidism after a TAVI procedure. The secondary endpoint is the influence of the&#xD;
      occurrence of hypothyroidism after the TAVI procedure on the geriatric assessment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aortic stenosis is highly prevalent in advancing age. The prevalence is 2.5% at an age of 75&#xD;
      years and 8.1% at an age of 85 years. The estimated mortality after onset of symptoms&#xD;
      (dizziness, syncope, thoracic pain and dyspnea) with conventional medical treatment is 75%&#xD;
      after 3 years follow up. The prognosis of this disease has dramatically changed with the&#xD;
      surgical replacement of the aortic valve. However, an open surgical procedure is not always&#xD;
      possible in high risk patients for anatomical reasons (sternotomy, radiation and chest&#xD;
      deformation) or comorbidities defined by the Euroscore and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons'&#xD;
      risk score (STS score).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trans-catheter aortic valve replacement (TAVI) is becoming the standard care of patients&#xD;
      suffering of non-operable, high risk severe and symptomatic aortic stenosis. The TAVI&#xD;
      procedure is associated with immediate hemodynamic improvement characterized by a decreased&#xD;
      aortic valve mean pressure gradient, an improved left ventricular end systolic volume and&#xD;
      mass, a decreased end ventricular diastolic volume and a better ejection fraction. This&#xD;
      hemodynamic improvement translates into better clinical outcomes. Mortality rates (2.2% and&#xD;
      6.7% at one month and at one year) and long term stroke rate are similar after TAVI or&#xD;
      surgical replacement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TAVI procedure is also successful in octogenarian and in frail patients. Consequently,&#xD;
      patient's frailty is a growing argument to refer the patient for a percutaneous treatment of&#xD;
      valve disease instead of a conventional surgical approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard evaluation before the TAVI procedure comprises some radiologic studies with&#xD;
      iodinated contrast agent (coronarography, thoracic CT scanner and the TAVI procedure itself).&#xD;
      Furthermore, some patients require a treatment with Amiodarone® because of the occurrence of&#xD;
      atrial fibrillation during the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A typical iodinated contrast study confers 13500 µg of free iodine and 15-60g of bound iodine&#xD;
      (several hundred thousand times above the recommended daily intake). An excess of iodium&#xD;
      expo-sure can lead to thyroid dysfunction:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hyperthyroidism particularly in patients with underlying nodular thyroid disease&#xD;
           (Jod-Basedow effect).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothyroidism in patients with underlying thyroid disease or in patients who are taking&#xD;
           medication (lithium, amiodarone) which can lead to thyroid dysfunction. The mechanism of&#xD;
           iodinated contrast agent hypothyroidism is the failure to escape of the acute&#xD;
           Wolf-Chaikoff effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amiodarone confers 3-21 mg iodine daily and can also lead to thyroid dysfunction particularly&#xD;
      in patients with underlying thyroid disease because of the failure to escape of the acute&#xD;
      Wolf-Chaikoff effect. An autoimmune mechanism is also described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epidemiology In our recent clinical practice (geriatric day hospital UZ Brussel), an&#xD;
      increased incidence of hypothyroidism in elderly patients after a TAVI procedure has been&#xD;
      observed. In our knowledge, there are no data about the incidence of hypothyroidism and what&#xD;
      could be the impact for elderly patients after a TAVI procedure.&#xD;
