  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the overwhelming impact of vaccines on child health and the tremendous progress in&#xD;
      vaccine coverage globally, challenges of vaccine inequities persist. Missed opportunities for&#xD;
      vaccination (MOV) is defined as any contact with health services by an individual who is&#xD;
      eligible for vaccination which does not result in the recommended vaccines being given. This&#xD;
      is common in several countries, and it presents a window of opportunity to provide vaccine&#xD;
      services to those vulnerable children accessing healthcare facilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall purpose of this project is to reduce missed opportunities for vaccinations by&#xD;
      targeting hospitalized children who are vulnerable to poor health outcomes, but who are also&#xD;
      within easy access of the healthcare system. The research team proposes implementing the&#xD;
      Missed Opportunities for Vaccination Equity (MOVE), an intervention to improve timeliness and&#xD;
      coverage of vaccination, and increase demand for vaccination services, through a combination&#xD;
      of sensitization of children's caregivers and health workers, manual vaccination data capture&#xD;
      in the ward, and re-purposed vaccination resources. The strategy engages key stakeholders in&#xD;
      the design of the intervention through a co-creation workshop; their involvement in the&#xD;
      design and execution of the intervention will improve sustainability in the long-term. This&#xD;
      intervention builds on existing healthcare systems, and, when scaled up, can target&#xD;
      inequities in vaccination coverage in the general population, without placing additional&#xD;
      strain on the healthcare system in terms of workforce or financial resources.&#xD;

      This pilot project is structured as a pre-post analysis of an implementation strategy to&#xD;
      address missed opportunities for vaccination (MOV) among hospitalized children in India and&#xD;
      Nigeria. India and Nigeria have similar rates of missed opportunities for vaccinations, and&#xD;
      similar discrepancies with monitoring vaccination records when a child is in the hospital.&#xD;
      The research team intends to collect the same pre-data in both India and Nigeria, implement&#xD;
      the same intervention in both countries, and collect the same post-data in both study sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pre-intervention, intervention, and post-intervention, are all described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-Intervention period: The first three months of the project constitute the&#xD;
      pre-intervention period, and they will consist of a situational analysis which will assess&#xD;
      the burden of MOV as well as the barriers and facilitators for reducing MOV. Eligible&#xD;
      participants will be enrolled after providing informed consent. Procedures would include&#xD;
      verifying vaccination cards and medical records at admission and at discharge, conducting&#xD;
      in-depth interviews with parents or caregivers during the hospital course, and administering&#xD;
      structured questionnaires to hospital healthcare personnel crucial to hospitalized child care&#xD;
      and provision of vaccinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: This will begin with a co-creation workshop where the results of the&#xD;
      pre-intervention period will be discussed, and the MOV intervention will be implemented. In&#xD;
      summary, the intervention will include four components which are: (1) Disseminate&#xD;
      (vaccination awareness among healthcare providers and child caregivers); (2) Document&#xD;
      (vaccination status); (3) Deploy (vaccines); and (4) Discharge (provide advice/referrals for&#xD;
      catch-up and routine vaccinations).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a human-centered design approach, the research team will design an intervention,&#xD;
      endorsed by local healthcare providers and stakeholders, which will be implemented primarily&#xD;
      by the existing hospital healthcare staff. Research staff will play a role in data collection&#xD;
      for monitoring purposes, but will not play a role in implementing the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-Intervention period: Ongoing data collection after the MOV intervention is initiated and&#xD;
      continued, will constitute the 'post-intervention' period. During this period, data&#xD;
      collectors will collect the same data that is being collected in the pre-intervention. The&#xD;
      research team intends to compare the results of our pre and post intervention data, to&#xD;
      determine if this intervention has reduced the amount of children who are missed for&#xD;
      vaccinations.&#xD;
