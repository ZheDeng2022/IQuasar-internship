  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Black cancer patients tend to have worse outcomes than White cancer patients. Some of this&#xD;
      disparity may be due to comorbidities. The purpose of this study is to improve management of&#xD;
      co-morbidities among cancer patients in order to improve cancer outcomes and improve health&#xD;
      equity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension can complicate cancer treatment or can make&#xD;
      it difficult to reach optimal health after treatment. This study will offer additional&#xD;
      support and tools to manage cancer patient's health needs. First, the study will use a mobile&#xD;
      health application, managed by a company called Welldoc, to monitor patient progress in real&#xD;
      time and to provide ongoing guidance. Second, the study will connect patients with a&#xD;
      Community Health Worker who will speak with them weekly to discuss self-care information,&#xD;
      including medical scheduling or appointment needs, and assist with daily self-monitoring of&#xD;
      blood pressure and/or blood glucose monitoring. Lastly, an oncology nurse will monitor&#xD;
      reported health and triage any medical needs and whether additional medical care is needed.&#xD;
