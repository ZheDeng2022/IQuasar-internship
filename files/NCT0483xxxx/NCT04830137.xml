  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human Phase 1a/1b multicenter, open-label oncology study designed to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and anti-cancer activity of NX-2127 in patients with advanced B-cell&#xD;
      malignancies.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phase 1a is a dose escalation to evaluate the safety and tolerability of NX-2127 in adult&#xD;
      patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) B-cell malignancies, who have required and received&#xD;
      at least 2 prior systemic therapies (or 1 prior therapy for patients with WM) and for whom no&#xD;
      other therapies are known to provide clinical benefit. Phase 1b will investigate the efficacy&#xD;
      of NX-2127 at the dose selected in Phase 1a in up to 5 cohorts of patients with R/R B-cell&#xD;
      malignancy indications who have received at least 2 prior systemic therapies (or 1 prior&#xD;
      therapy for patients with WM):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) or Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (SLL) with no BTK C481&#xD;
           mutation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BTK C481 mutation-positive CLL/SLL&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL), Marginal Zone Lymphoma (MZL) or Waldenstrom&#xD;
           Macroglobulinemia (WM)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follicular lymphoma (FL)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL)&#xD;
