      Prospective study comparing hemodynamic and respiratory changes and exercise capacity during&#xD;
      Cardio-Pulmonary-Exercise-Testing (CPET) in 4 groups of infants; Three different groups of&#xD;
      premature infants and term controls&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study population included 4 groups of infants; preterm infants born &lt; 300 weeks'&#xD;
      gestation with BPD (i.e. oxygen dependence for at least 28 postnatal days 5), preterm infants&#xD;
      born &lt; 300 weeks' gestation without BPD, late preterm infants (born at 340-366 weeks'&#xD;
      gestation) and term controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmonary function testing and spirometry were measured Participants performed CPET on an&#xD;
      electronically braked cycle ergometer. During the exercise testing, serial saturation, heart&#xD;
      rate and blood pressure measurements were obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The peak oxygen consumption (VO2max) was measured and served as the primary endpoint of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
