    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 study that will be conducted in 2 parts. Participants may participate in 1&#xD;
      part only.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part 1 will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose&#xD;
           study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK of CC-92480-02 (Formulation A)&#xD;
           administered orally under fasted conditions in healthy adult participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part 2 will be a randomized, open-label, 2 × 4 crossover study (Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4)&#xD;
           to evaluate the relative bioavailability (RBA) of Formulation A versus Formulation B&#xD;
           under fasted conditions and explore safety, tolerability, and PK effects of food on&#xD;
           Formulation A and Formulation B in healthy adult participants.&#xD;

Any worsening (ie, any clinically significant adverse change in the frequency or intensity of a preexisting condition) should be considered an AE.</description>

          2. Healthy adult female of nonchildbearing potential or male of any race, between 18 to&#xD;
             55 years of age (inclusive) at the time of signing the ICF, and in good health as&#xD;
             determined by the screening history and Physical examination (PE).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Agrees to abide by the requirements and restrictions outlined in the CC-92480&#xD;
             Pregnancy Prevention Plan for Participants in Clinical Trials.&#xD;
