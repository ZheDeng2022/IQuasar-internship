  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of our study is to understand the extent to which the blood vessels are affected&#xD;
      by glucose and fat (lipids) in lean healthy adults and if these changes in the blood vessels&#xD;
      contribute to the development of high blood pressure.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension, obesity, and insulin resistance are associated with elevated muscle sympathetic&#xD;
      nerve activity (MSNA), which is important for blood pressure regulation. The measurement of&#xD;
      MSNA is safely performed in humans using the microneurographic technique that involves&#xD;
      recording sympathetic nerve activity projecting to skeletal muscle using a small&#xD;
      microelectrode at the peroneal nerve near the knee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The health of your blood vessels will be tested in this study, in addition to the activity of&#xD;
      the nerves that control the blood vessels. The function of the nerves and blood vessels can&#xD;
      be diminished by high blood glucose and lipids, and we will test the ability of a well-known&#xD;
      antioxidant, ascorbic acid (vitamin C), to restore the function of the nerves and blood&#xD;
      vessels.&#xD;
