  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The general practitioner is confronted with unselected smokers whose attempts to quit smoking&#xD;
      are often repeated over time before leading to a definitive cessation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each year, 3-5% of smokers succeed in quitting in the general population. The corollary is&#xD;
      that the majority of smokers are in a situation of failure in their attempt to quit: 33%&#xD;
      declared during the 2019 French Health Barometer to have made an attempt of at least 7 days&#xD;
      in the past year. Thus, this status of &quot;smoker&quot; can cover a wide variety of situations: no&#xD;
      attempt to stop smoking, attempt(s) of more or less clinical significance, previous support&#xD;
      or not by a health professional, etc. Currently, the HAS recommendations do not determine a&#xD;
      specific course of action for these smokers, whose experiences may be very different. It&#xD;
      could therefore be interesting to objectivize the smoking cessation process of these patients&#xD;
      who have or have not succeeded in quitting, in order to deduce profiles of smokers according&#xD;
      to their previous smoking cessation experiences. Furthermore, the choice and relevance of the&#xD;
      cessation criteria used are debated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the randomized controlled trial DISCO on COPD screening interventions in primary&#xD;
      care (3 intervention arms, 1 control arm), the investigators will carry out a pilot&#xD;
      cross-sectional survey on the cessation process of smokers during the 2 years following their&#xD;
      participation, evaluating the incidence and modalities of cessation attempts of smokers&#xD;
      belonging to an age group at risk of COPD (40-80 years) and who initially consulted their&#xD;
      general practitioner for any reason 2 years ago at the time of their inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The impact on future management could be the personalization of cessation advice given to&#xD;
      smokers according to quantitative and qualitative indicators specific to their experience,&#xD;
      their previous history of smoking cessation, their health situation and socio-demographic&#xD;
      characteristics. Eventually, a gradation of the levels of support offered to patients in&#xD;
      general practice on the basis of predictive factors of smoking cessation could be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that participation in COPD screening with the GP may be&#xD;
      associated with patient progress in quitting smoking. This pilot study will be conducted on a&#xD;
      random sample of 120 participants from the subgroup of 544 patients who were smokers at&#xD;
      inclusion in DISCO.&#xD;
