    <textblock>
      This is a study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TQ-B3525 in subjects with recurrent /&#xD;
      metastatic advanced endometrial cancer, cervical cancer and ovarian cancer with PIK3CA and /&#xD;
      or PIK3R1 / 2 gene-altered (mutation or amplification). Endometrial cancer, cervical cancer&#xD;
      and ovarian cancer are divided into three cohorts, each cohort administrated TQ-B3525 tablet&#xD;
      orally once a day.&#xD;
