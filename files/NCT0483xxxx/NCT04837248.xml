  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer surgery usually results in reduced range of motion of the shoulder joint,&#xD;
      weakness of the musculature and altered scapular kinematics during movement. These factors&#xD;
      limit activities of daily living, so rehabilitation exercises help to restore function after&#xD;
      shoulder surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women with breast cancer often have a life conditioned by the sequelae or morbidity secondary&#xD;
      to the treatment of the disease and, despite the high cure rate, many patients are unable to&#xD;
      regain their initial quality of life. Cancer therapies can leave physical, psychological and&#xD;
      psychosocial sequelae, which may manifest themselves or persist even years after the end of&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all these reasons, patients who have undergone cancer treatment need physical&#xD;
      rehabilitation as well as psychological and social care to support them in their new stage of&#xD;
      life, and to optimise the rehabilitation programme, it is necessary to identify each&#xD;
      patient's individual needs,&#xD;
&#xD;
      The digital support proposed in this study enables the development of a physiotherapy&#xD;
      programme for patients with breast cancer in a situation of health crisis, which includes&#xD;
      providing assistance, information, accompaniment, help and treatment to these patients in a&#xD;
      comprehensive way, based on the biopsychosocial model.&#xD;

      DESIGN: Single-centre, assessor-blinded, parallel-group, randomised controlled clinical&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS: The study will be carried out at the Ramon y Cajal hospital with 92 patients&#xD;
      diagnosed and operated on for breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who come to the consultation of the rehabilitation doctors will be assessed,&#xD;
      considering the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Those who may be candidates will be&#xD;
      informed about the study and referred to the physiotherapy department where the treatment&#xD;
      orders for these patients will be received and an appointment will be made. This is the start&#xD;
      of the recruitment phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those who meet the criteria and agree to participate in the study will be assigned an&#xD;
      identification code and will be randomised into the two groups, the intervention group and&#xD;
      the conventional treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who do not meet the inclusion criteria or refuse to participate in the study will&#xD;
      receive conventional treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 6-month pilot study will be conducted to better define patient identification, inclusion&#xD;
      criteria, recruitment and adjustment of the intervention if required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the pilot study is completed, the intervention clinical trial will begin. A first&#xD;
      analysis of all variables will be performed after the intervention phase of the trial, 6&#xD;
      weeks after inclusion in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An interim analysis will also be performed at 3 months in which the same variables as at 6&#xD;
      weeks will be assessed. This will be the main analysis of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final analysis will be carried out 6 months after inclusion in the study, and this will&#xD;
      conclude the follow-up phase.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will be treated using a physiotherapy programme without digital support. A written document with exercises and recommendations will be given to them on the first day. This booklet will detail the exercises they can do depending on their surgery and the weeks elapsed, as well as the recommendations adapted according to the needs identified in the motivational interview (MI). This is the treatment that is currently being applied in the hospital.&#xD;
The patient will carry out the treatment at home and will come back after 20 sessions for the corresponding assessment.</description>

    <description>A digitally supported physiotherapy programme including:&#xD;
Group session: expectations, interests, experiences with regard to their health problem and the consequences on their life, joint exercise and discussion with subsequent debate will be held.&#xD;
Exercise session: each week, patients will find different exercise videos on the platform according to the phase of recovery in which each one of them is, having been previously evaluated in the group session.&#xD;
Relaxation session: this will be carried out by means of audio that will be posted on the platform and that the patient will be able to perform simultaneously.&#xD;
Empowerment session: audio sessions that will deal with those needs that frequently arise after breast surgery in their daily lives, focusing on limiting beliefs (e.g. fear of moving), positive thoughts and information extracted from the motivational interview that should be developed.</description>
