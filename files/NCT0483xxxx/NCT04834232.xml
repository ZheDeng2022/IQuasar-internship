      Comparing the result of of iliac vein stenting and compression therapy in management of&#xD;
      recurrent venous ulceration.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Venous ulceration is the most common etiology of lower extremity ulceration, approximately&#xD;
      affecting almost 1% of the world's population. although its overall prevalence is relatively&#xD;
      low, the refractory nature of venous ulceration increases morbidity, mortality , the&#xD;
      patient's quality of life, and have a significant financial burden on the global budget. the&#xD;
      primary risk factors are: old age, obesity deep venous thrombosis, phlebitis and previous leg&#xD;
      injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Iliac vein compression is a prevalent finding in patients with venous system pathology. It&#xD;
      has a variety of causes, including May-Turner syndrome, endometriosis, bladder distension,&#xD;
      common iliac artery aneurysm or internal iliac artery aneurysm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      venous compression becomes clinically significant when there's an increase in venous&#xD;
      pressure, which in turn causes venous insufficiency. This contributes to the development of a&#xD;
      state of chronic venous stasis, which sequentially causes pooling of blood, triggers further&#xD;
      capillary damage and activates inflammatory mediators with the end result of venous ulcer&#xD;
      development and impaired wound healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Located on bony prominences, venous ulcers are typically shallow, irregular with granulation&#xD;
      tissue and fibrin present in their bases. A careful physical examination is required for a&#xD;
      proper diagnosis, but he clinical challenge remains in its management, which includes&#xD;
      prevention or the treatment of the clinical implications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment modalities should always be directed to the cause of the ulcer; they can be divided&#xD;
      into:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  non invasive management, such as medical therapy, bandaging and dressings.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  invasive, such as endovascular and surgical techniques.&#xD;

    <description>the score is obtained by imaging vein segments with duplex Doppler or phlebography.&#xD;
It includes 9 hallmarks of venous disease, each scored on a severity scale from 0 to 3.</description>

    <intervention_name>compression therapy</intervention_name>
    <description>compression bandaging or graduated compression hosiery consists of applying a type of elastic device, mainly on the limbs, to exert a controlled pressure on the lower limbs. The controlled pressure exerted by medical compression stockings reduces the diameter of major veins, thereby increasing the velocity and volume of blood flow, along with conditions beneficial for the healing of chronic inflammatory disorders (e.g. cellulitis, erysipelas, venous leg ulcers, etc.), through reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine levels and higher levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokines.</description>
