  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hemiplegia is one of the most common sequelae of stroke. Stroke is the leading cause of&#xD;
      disability in adults all around the world. Stroke survivors can suffer several neurological&#xD;
      impairments and deficits which have an important impact on patient's quality of life and&#xD;
      which increase the costs for health and social services. After stroke, impairments in ADLs&#xD;
      and functional status, deterioration in health related quality of life can be seen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to Determine the effect of Aerobic exercise training on Balance,&#xD;
      Walking capacity and quality of life in sub-acute stroke.&#xD;
