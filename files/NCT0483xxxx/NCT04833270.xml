  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2-arm parallel pragmatic randomized controlled trial that will compare&#xD;
      non-pharmacological treatment with pharmacological therapy for lumbar disc herniation.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants who voluntarily signed informed consent form and eligible for the study were&#xD;
      randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio (15:15) for non-pharmacological treatment and&#xD;
      pharmacological treatment group. Participants of each group will receive twice a week for&#xD;
      total 8 weeks of intervention. This is a pragmatic randomized controlled trial, so physicians&#xD;
      will have medical decision making according to each participant's conditions and choose the&#xD;
      specific intervention and dosage of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment.&#xD;
