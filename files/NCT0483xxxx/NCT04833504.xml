  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to monitor all patients exposed to CD19 CAR-T expressing IL7 and CCL19&#xD;
      for 5 years following infusion, to assess their long-term efficacy, including the CAR-vector&#xD;
      persistence, the normal immunity rebuilding and the risk of delayed adverse events (AEs).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients are enrolled following completion from the early clinical study of CD19-7X19 CAR-T&#xD;
      treatment ( NCT03258047) and will be followed for 5 years post treatment from the last&#xD;
      treatment. They will be monitored for safety and efficacy with the primary treatment&#xD;
      protocols for the protocol defined duration. This long-term following up study allow an&#xD;
      interim analysis to evaluate the outcomes of the study when it arrives in 2 years Collection&#xD;
      of such long term effects of CAR-T cell therapy will help to further define the risk-benefit&#xD;
      profile of CAR-T Therapies.&#xD;
