  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regular physical activity is an evidence-based adjuvant therapy of chronic heart failure or&#xD;
      chronic lung diseases. Structured exercise training is safe, increases exercise capacity and&#xD;
      quality of life, relieves symptoms and reduces hospitalization rates. Even a trend towards&#xD;
      reduction of mortality has been identified. However, dyspnea and fatigue, typical symptoms of&#xD;
      heart or lung failure, force patients to physical inactivity which fatally aggravates&#xD;
      deconditioning and exercise intolerance, leading to an increased risk of hospitalization and&#xD;
      a loss of independence and quality of life. To break through this vicious circle physical&#xD;
      activity must be restored, since exercise intolerance can be successfully improved by&#xD;
      physical training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will address the challenging task of remobilizing patients with advanced chronic&#xD;
      lung or heart failure in a functional New York Heart Association class III-IV by using an&#xD;
      externally physically-supported exosuit movement therapy. This soft, wearable robot (fig. 1)&#xD;
      assists mobilization according to individual needs by activating neuromuscular feedback&#xD;
      systems, promoting physical activity and preventing early physical exhaustion. The&#xD;
      investigators hypotheses that an exosuit-supported training increases exercise capacity and&#xD;
      quality of life in a greater degree than non-supported training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of two parts investigating i) the feasibility, tolerance and safety&#xD;
      (n= 30) and ii) the efficacy of an exosuit device-supported training (n=30). In i) patients&#xD;
      will perform a walking test and a set of everyday life skills or participate in a&#xD;
      standardized rehabilitation sports program. In ii) patients will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio&#xD;
      for an exosuit-supported or non-supported exercise training protocol, training 3 units per&#xD;
      week for 8 weeks. Assessment of outcome will be performed by various functional, mobility and&#xD;
      endurance tests, questionnaires and clinical parameters. Furthermore, the transfer of&#xD;
      regained motor and balance skills to everyday life will be analyzed.&#xD;
