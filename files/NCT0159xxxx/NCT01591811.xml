      1. To test the hypothesis that when prone, patients treated with 3D-CRT breast radiotherapy&#xD;
           and randomly assigned to either a weekly or a daily boost to the tumor bed develop acute&#xD;
           toxicity that is not significantly worse than that of a concurrent cohort of patients&#xD;
           treated with IMRT randomly assigned to a weekly or daily boost regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To test the hypothesis that when prone, patients treated with 3D-CRT breast&#xD;
           radiotherapy, randomly assigned to either a weekly or a daily boost to the tumor bed&#xD;
           develop late toxicity that is not significantly worse than that of concurrent cohort of&#xD;
           patients treated with IMRT randomly assigned to a weekly of daily boost.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To test hypothesis that 5 year local control rates of â‰¤ 5% in-breast recurrence can be&#xD;
           achieved in each of the two randomized arms, for either technique tested.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      During the past ten years the Breast Cancer Radiotherapy Research team at NYU has conducted a&#xD;
      series of consecutive studies to optimize the safe delivery of accelerated radiotherapy to&#xD;
      partial and whole breast in the prone position, as summarized in a recent review of this&#xD;
      experience. The current protocol focuses on whole breast radiotherapy for women with stage&#xD;
      0-2 breast cancer treated by segmental mastectomy: it aims at further refining the role of&#xD;
      prone IMRT versus a 3D-conformal radiotherapy technique in this common subset of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is an open label randomized trial. Patients will be randomized within cohort&#xD;
      defined by assigned treatment (3D CRT if IMRT not covered or IMRT) and within these primary&#xD;
      strata by menopausal status (pre/post) and by chemotherapy prior to radiation (yes/no). The&#xD;
      on-site treatment randomization assignments will done on site and treatment assignments will&#xD;
      be provided to the Research Nurse after she has confirmed eligibility. Patients will be&#xD;
      randomized within the primary strata based on presumed insurance coverage on consent to the&#xD;
      study to allow simulation to proceed. Should the coverage change, then the patient will be&#xD;
      re-randomized in the correct stratum and the initial randomization number will be retired&#xD;
      with a notation that the initial stratification was revised and patient re-randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will have completed all breast surgical procedures prior to accrual into this&#xD;
      protocol in order to establish eligibility criteria. Final pathology margins must be at least&#xD;
      1 mm in all directions to be eligible. The patient may undergo re-excision if the initial&#xD;
      margins are involved or close (&lt; 1mm). If the patient meets the eligibility criteria after&#xD;
      re-excision, she may be entered onto the study.&#xD;
