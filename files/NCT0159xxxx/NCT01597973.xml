      Approximately 444 subjects who are greater than or equal to 18 to 95 years of age, are&#xD;
      non-pregnant, and are in the inpatient setting of one of the study sites will be evaluated to&#xD;
      treatment efficacy. Analysis will include subjects with bloodstream infection (BSI) or&#xD;
      pneumonia due to at least one of the following gram-negative bacilli organisms: Acinetobacter&#xD;
      baumannii, Klebsiella spp, Escherichia coli, Enterbactor spp. and/or Pseudomonas aeruginosa&#xD;
      that demonstrates in vitro non-susceptibility defined as extensively drug-resistant&#xD;
      Gram-negative bacilli (XDR-GNB) which includes XDR-AB, XDR-PA and CRE. If a subject has both&#xD;
      BSI and pneumonia at the time of study enrollment, they will be included as a subject with&#xD;
      pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      •Determine whether the treatment regimen of Colistimethate sodium (colistin) combined with a&#xD;
      carbapenem (imipenem or meropenem) is associated with a decreased risk for mortality compared&#xD;
      to colistin alone for subjects with bloodstream infection (BSI) and/or pneumonia due to&#xD;
      XDR-GNB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      •Determine what treatment regimen (colistin monotherapy or colistin combined with a&#xD;
      carbapenem (imipenem or meropenem) is more likely to reduce the emergence of colistin&#xD;
      resistance among XDR-GNB isolates during therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Gram-negative bacilli organisms Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella spp., Escherichia&#xD;
      coli, Enterbactor spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa have become a frequent cause of bloodstream&#xD;
      infection and pneumonia in the hospital and other healthcare settings. Among these pathogens,&#xD;
      antimicrobial resistance has emerged to many classes of antimicrobial agents. Most&#xD;
      concerning, has been the emergence of resistance to group 2 carbapenems (such as imipenem).&#xD;
      In several regions of the world, including Southeastern Michigan, strains of extensively-drug&#xD;
      resistant Gram-negative bacilli (XDR-GNB) that exhibit resistance to most, and in some cases&#xD;
      all types of available antimicrobial agents, including group 2 carbapenems, have emerged and&#xD;
      disseminated. Treatment options for XDR-GNB typically include Colistimethate sodium (referred&#xD;
      to as colistin in this study), used alone (monotherapy) or in combination with other agents.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, resistance to colistin has begun to emerge in some strains of XDR-GNB, which&#xD;
      is a truly concerning development, since colistin is one of the last remaining treatment&#xD;
      options for XDR-GNB. No prospective, randomized controlled trials have been conducted to&#xD;
      evaluate the clinical efficacy of colistin monotherapy versus colistin-containing combination&#xD;
      therapy or the impact of these therapeutic modalities on the emergence of colistin resistance&#xD;
      among XDR-GNB. We plan to conduct a double-blind randomized controlled trial including&#xD;
      patients with pneumonia and bloodstream infection due to XDR-GNB. After enrollment, subjects&#xD;
      will be randomized to receive 14 days of either colistin monotherapy or colistin plus&#xD;
      meropenem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Detroit metro area, infections due to XDR-GNB have developed into a regional challenge&#xD;
      and common problem. We have assembled a multi-disciplinary team that includes Infectious&#xD;
      Diseases researchers, clinicians, infectious diseases pharmacists, microbiologists,&#xD;
      epidemiologists and statistical experts to address critically important questions and&#xD;
      challenges regarding the management of bloodstream infection and pneumonia due to XDR-GNB.&#xD;
      Specifically, we hypothesize that the combination of colistin and imipenem will provide&#xD;
      superior efficacy in the treatment of XDR-GNB pneumonia and bloodstream infection and will&#xD;
      prevent the emergence of decreased susceptibility to colistin among XDR-GNB strains. We also&#xD;
      aim to analyze tools that could be used in &quot;real time&quot; to aid clinicians treating patients&#xD;
      with infection due to XDR-GNB. For example, we aim to analyze the association between the&#xD;
      presence of in vitro synergy of the colistin and carbapenem (imipenem or meropenem)&#xD;
      combination (as determined by E-test) and clinical outcomes; and the association between&#xD;
      colistin plasma levels and clinical outcomes and the development of nephrotoxicity.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hospitalized Adults (&gt; 18 years to 95 years of age), at one of the study sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of BSI and/or pneumonia due to a preliminary result of gram-negative&#xD;
             non-lactose fermenter that is oxidase negative; or a final results of XDR-A.&#xD;
             baumannii; carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaciae; or XDR- P. aeruginosa and/or&#xD;
             patients with suspected BSI and/or HAP and who have had a prior history (within last 6&#xD;
             months) of XDR-GNB that was susceptible to colistin.&#xD;
&#xD;
             o If final results do not indicate that the pathogen is an XDR-GNB, and identifies&#xD;
             alternative treatment options, the patient would be eligible for the study if the&#xD;
             subject is allergic to all the alternative treatment options.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with polymicrobial respiratory or blood infections, including XDR-GNB and one&#xD;
             or more pathogens, will be included in the study, as long as the XDR-GNB is determined&#xD;

             primary study pathogen. If more than one study pathogen is recovered from the same&#xD;
             culture, then the infection will be categorized as being caused by multiple study&#xD;
             pathogens.&#xD;

             endocarditis, osteomyelitis, prosthetic joint infections, meningitis and/or other&#xD;
             central nervous system infections.&#xD;
