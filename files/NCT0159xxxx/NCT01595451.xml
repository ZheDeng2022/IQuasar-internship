  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We are doing this study to investigate the effects of acupuncture on chronic low back pain.&#xD;
      We are interested in learning about brain activity during pain. We plan to look at brain&#xD;
      activity at the beginning and the end of the study, after 6 sessions of acupuncture&#xD;
      treatment. You will be randomly assigned to one of two groups to receive either real or&#xD;
      placebo acupuncture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acupuncture has been used for many years to help relieve pain. However, it is not clear how&#xD;
      acupuncture works. Acupuncture may relieve pain by changing activity in the nervous system.&#xD;
      Some studies indicate that acupuncture may relieve the low back pain. However, we need more&#xD;
      research to see how well acupuncture works to relieve pain for people with this condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we will measure your brain activity before and after you do exercises to make&#xD;
      your back pain worse. We will also measure your brain activity while inflating a pressure&#xD;
      cuff device on your lower leg. We will measure this brain activity using a research tool&#xD;
      called functional MRI (fMRI). Functional MRI is a very fast MRI that uses radio waves and a&#xD;
      magnet, and allows the study investigators to look at changes in blood flow to different&#xD;
      parts of the brain when there are changes in brain activity.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Meet the Classification Criteria of the chronic LBP (having low back pain for more&#xD;
             than 6 months), as determined by the referring physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be able to provoke or exacerbate their cLBP using our calibrated&#xD;
             exercise-like maneuver.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least 4/10 clinical pain on the 11-point LBP severity scale on average during the&#xD;
             past two weeks prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least a 10th grade English-reading level; English can be a second language provided&#xD;
             that the patients feel they understand all the questions used in the assessment&#xD;
             measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Right handed individuals&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have had a prior evaluation of their low back pain by a health care provider,&#xD;
             which may include radiographic studies. Documentation of this evaluation will be&#xD;
             obtained from subject's medical record.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Specific causes of back pain (e.g., cancer, fractures, spinal stenosis, infections)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Complicated back problems (e.g., prior back surgery, medico-legal issues)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Possible contraindications for acupuncture (e.g., coagulation disorders, cardiac&#xD;
             pacemakers, pregnancy, seizure disorder), and conditions that might confound treatment&#xD;
             effects or interpretation of results (e.g., severe fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Conditions making treatment difficult (e.g., paralysis, psychoses, or other severe&#xD;
             psychiatric problems based on the judgment of a physician investigator and/or a T&#xD;
             score &gt;60 on the psychological assessments performed during Session 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior acupuncture treatment for back pain; 1 year minimum for any other condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The intent to undergo surgery during the time of involvement in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of cardiac, respiratory, or nervous system disease that, in the judgment of a&#xD;
             physician investigator, precludes participation in the study because of a heightened&#xD;
             potential for adverse outcome (e.g., asthma, claustrophobia)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of any contraindications to MRI scanning (e.g., cardiac pacemaker, metal&#xD;
             implants, fear of closed spaces, pregnancy)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active substance abuse disorders within the last 24 months, based on subject&#xD;
             self-report&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unresolved medical legal/disability/workers compensation claims&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Radicular knee pain extending below the knee&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of more than 60 mg morphine equivalent prescription opioids or steroids for pain.&#xD;
