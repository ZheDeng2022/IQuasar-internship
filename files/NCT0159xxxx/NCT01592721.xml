  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incorporation of novel targeted therapies to radiation therapy is of particular interest&#xD;
      in head and neck cancer and may improve efficacy without significantly increasing toxicity.&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the addition of a second EGFR-targeted agent that inhibits&#xD;
      EGFR at the intracellular level will improve the antitumor effect of standard radiation and&#xD;
      cetuximab. The goal of this study is to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and the biologic&#xD;
      effects in patients with locally advanced SCCHN of an antisense gene targeting the EGFR in&#xD;
      combination with standard therapy with radiation and cetuximab.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) is highly expressed in SCCHN and its&#xD;
      overexpression is associated with poor patient outcome. EGFR is a promising target of&#xD;
      anticancer therapy. The investigators have developed EGFR antisense DNA as a safe and&#xD;
      potentially efficacious treatment for SCCHN as shown in a previous phase I study conducted at&#xD;
      the University of Pittsburgh. Cetuximab (Erbitux or C225) is a chimerized EGFR monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody that has produced positive results in a phase III trial in SCCHN when added to&#xD;
      radiation therapy and was approved by the FDA for the treatment of locally advanced SCCHN.&#xD;
      Radiation plus cetuximab is considered a standard treatment, especially for patients who are&#xD;
      not good candidates for chemotherapy. In the current study, the investigators plan to&#xD;
      evaluate the addition of intratumoral EGFR antisense DNA (EGFR AS) to standard radiation with&#xD;
      concurrent cetuximab in patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety of the combination of intratumoral EGFS AS DNA with standard&#xD;
           cetuximab and radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the locoregional progression-free survival in selected patients with locally&#xD;
           advanced SCCHN treated with intratumoral EGFR AS DNA combined with standard radiation&#xD;
           plus cetuximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate other efficacy parameters, including the objective response rate, distant&#xD;
           control and overall progression-free survival, and overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the effect of EGFR antisense therapy on EGFR-related biomarkers. The&#xD;
           investigators will use reverse phase protein microarrays (RPPA) and immunohistochemical&#xD;
           (IHC) analysis of tissue microarrays (TMA) on baseline and post-treatment tumor tissue&#xD;
           to determine the expression level and modulation of a panel of EGFR and EGFR-pathway&#xD;
           related biomarkers, including (but not necessarily limited to) EGFR, pEGFR, Src, pMAPK,&#xD;
           STAT3, pSTAT3, pSTAT5, pSTAT1, pAKT, p38, p21, p27, PARP, E-cadherin, p-ErbB3, and Ki67.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine the transfection of the EGFR antisense gene therapy in vivo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject population&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will enroll patients with SCCHN who are suitable for intratumoral&#xD;
      injections of EGFR antisense.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      EGFR AS will be administered by direct intratumoral injection using direct visualization,&#xD;
      endoscopy, or imaging-guidance (ultrasound) as clinically determined (see protocol). Patients&#xD;
      will receive a total of up to 4 weekly intratumoral injections of EGFR antisense (or less if&#xD;
      there is no identifiable tumor) starting 2 weeks prior to radiation (study schema in&#xD;
      protocol). Patients will receive standard radiation 70 Gy/200 cGy/daily, 5 days/week, with&#xD;
      concurrent cetuximab 250 mg/m2, after a loading dose of 400 mg/m2 2 weeks prior to starting&#xD;
      radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Design and Sample Size&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in two-stages. In the first stage, 11 patients with stage IVA-C&#xD;
      or recurrent disease will be evaluated for safety. If the regimen is deemed safe, a total of&#xD;
      31 patients with stage III or IVA-B, previously untreated SCCHN will be enrolled in the&#xD;
      second stage of the study.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  First stage Patients with AJCC 7th edition stage IVA-IVC or recurrent or metastatic&#xD;
             head and neck cancer will be eligible. Patients with M1 disease must have asymptomatic&#xD;
             or low volume distant metastasis and require palliation for local and regional&#xD;
             disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Second stage (phase II part) Patients with AJCC 7th edition stage III-IVB (T1-T4,&#xD;
             N1-3M0) head and neck cancer, except WHO type II and III nasopharyngeal cancer,&#xD;
             including unknown primary tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma or&#xD;
             variants or poorly differentiated carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unidimensionally measurable disease (RECIST criteria).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status of 0-2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In the second stage of the study, therapy will be administered with a curative intent&#xD;
             and patients should not have recurrent disease or distant metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Primary tumor and/or lymphadenopathy should be technically suitable for intratumoral&#xD;
             injections. The Otolaryngologist specialist on the head and neck team will determine&#xD;
             this feasibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participating patients should agree to undergo a tumor biopsy at baseline as well as&#xD;
             approximately 2 weeks later as specified in study schema.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  First stage: any prior treatment, except prior therapy, which specifically and&#xD;
             directly targets the EGFR pathway, administered within the last 6 months. No prior&#xD;
             radiation therapy to the head and neck.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Second stage: no prior chemotherapy, biologic/molecular targeted therapy (including&#xD;
             any prior therapy which specifically and directly targets the EGFR pathway), or&#xD;
             radiotherapy for head and neck cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior surgical therapy will consist only of incisional or excisional biopsy, including&#xD;
             tonsillectomy, and organ sparing procedures, including neck dissection. Any non-biopsy&#xD;
             surgical procedure for head and neck cancer must have taken place at least one month&#xD;
             before initiating protocol treatment, at the treating physician's discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Absolute neutrophil count above/equal to 1,000/µL Platelets above/equal to 75,000/µL&#xD;
        Hemoglobin above/ equal to 10 g/dL Total bilirubin &lt;2 x upper normal institutional limits&#xD;
        Creatinine clearance &gt; 20 mL/min&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 18 years or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Because radiation therapy is known to be teratogenic and EFGR inhibitors may have&#xD;
             teratogenic potential, women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use&#xD;
             adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control) prior to study&#xD;
             entry and for the duration of study participation, and for 3 months after completing&#xD;
             study treatment. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while&#xD;
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Informed consent must be obtained from all patients prior to beginning therapy.&#xD;
             Patients should have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written&#xD;
             informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance &lt; 20 mL/min)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with anticoagulants, except when used to maintain the patency of a central&#xD;
             venous line, or INR &gt;1.5, or PTT ratio &gt;1.5.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements. Significant history of uncontrolled cardiac disease; i.e.,&#xD;
             uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina, uncontrolled congestive heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No history of prior malignancy, with the exception of curatively treated squamous cell&#xD;
             or basal carcinoma of the skin or in situ cervical cancer, DCIS or LCIS of the breast,&#xD;
             localized early stage prostate cancer, or malignancy that has been treated with a&#xD;
             curative intent with a 3-year disease-free survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because cetuximab, EGFR AS, and radiation&#xD;
             have the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an&#xD;
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with cetuximab and EGFR AS, breastfeeding should be&#xD;
             discontinued if the mother is treated with cetuximab. The effects of cetuximab and&#xD;
             EGFR AS on the developing human fetus at the recommended therapeutic dose are unknown.&#xD;
             For this reason women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate&#xD;
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control) prior to study entry and&#xD;
             for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she&#xD;
             is pregnant while in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from&#xD;
             the study because of possible drug interactions with cetuximab. Appropriate studies&#xD;
             will be undertaken in patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy when&#xD;
             indicated. HIV status of the patient will be obtained from the patient's history via&#xD;
             discussion with the investigator. HIV testing is not required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior severe infusion reaction to a monoclonal antibody.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are not informed of and are not willing to comply with the&#xD;
             investigational nature of the study and have not signed a written informed consent in&#xD;
             accordance with institutional and good clinical practice guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Phase 2 ONLY (second stage) - Subjects M1 disease will be excluded.&#xD;
