      Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation of NiCord®, Umbilical Cord Blood-Derived Ex Vivo&#xD;
      Expanded Stem and Progenitor Cells, in Patients with Hemoglobinopathies&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Umbilical cord blood (UCB) is an alternative stem cell source for hematopoietic stem cell&#xD;
      transplantations (HSCT) and can be used for the treatment of various life-threatening&#xD;
      diseases, such as hematological malignancies or genetic blood disorders, in such cases where&#xD;
      a matched related stem cell donor is not available. However, the major drawback of using this&#xD;
      valuable stem cells source is the limited cell dose in a single cord blood unit (CBU), which&#xD;
      was shown to be associated with inadequate hematopoietic reconstitution and high risk of&#xD;
      transplant-related mortality. To improve outcomes and extend applicability of UCB&#xD;
      transplantation, one potential solution is ex vivo expansion of UCB-derived stem and&#xD;
      progenitor cells. NiCord® is a stem/progenitor cell based product composed of ex vivo&#xD;
      expanded allogeneic UCB cells. NiCord® is based on a novel technology for the ex vivo cell&#xD;
      expansion of cord blood derived hematopoietic progenitor cells. By increasing the number of&#xD;
      the short and long-term reconstitution progenitor cells transplanted, NiCord® has the&#xD;
      potential to enable the broader application of UCB transplantation, and improve the clinical&#xD;
      outcomes of UCB transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part 1 of this study, NiCord® will be administered to the patient in conjunction with a&#xD;
      second, unmanipulated CBU. In Part 2 of this study, NiCord® will be administered to the&#xD;
      patient without a second, unmanipulated CBU. The study duration per patient is approximately&#xD;
      270 days from signing of informed consent to last visit on day 180 post-transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall study objectives of part 1 of this study are to evaluate the safety and efficacy&#xD;
      of co-transplantation of NiCord® and an unmanipulated CBU in patients with Hemoglobinopathies&#xD;
      (Sickle Cell Disease (SCD), or thalassemia major) following myeloablative therapy. The&#xD;
      overall study objectives of part 2 of this study are to evaluate the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      transplantation of NiCord® in patients with Hemoglobinopathies (Sickle Cell Disease (SCD), or&#xD;
      thalassemia major) following myeloablative therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesis for part 1 of this study is that the co-transplantation of NiCord® and&#xD;
      an unmanipulated unrelated cord blood graft in patients with hemoglobinopathies (SCD, or&#xD;
      thalassemia major) following myeloablative preparative therapy will be safe and will enable&#xD;
      cord blood engraftment. The study hypothesis for part 2 of this study is that transplantation&#xD;
      of NiCord® in patients with hemoglobinopathies (SCD, or thalassemia major) following&#xD;
      myeloablative preparative therapy will be safe and will enable cord blood engraftment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to fifteen (15) evaluable patients recruited for part 1 of the study and up to five (5)&#xD;
      patients for part 2 of the study should be 2-45 years of age, at least 10 kg in weight, have&#xD;
      symptomatic SCD or thalassemia major and should be considered as candidates for allogeneic&#xD;
      myeloablative HSCT for the treatment of SCD.&#xD;
