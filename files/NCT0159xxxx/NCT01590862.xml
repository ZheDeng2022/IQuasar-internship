  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We propose to study approach/avoidance behavior as measured by the Approach Avoidance task in&#xD;
      20 epilepsy patients undergoing implementation of depth electrodes for seizure monitoring in&#xD;
      the Epilepsy Monitoring Unit at MGH. We will also study the effects of VC/VS electrical&#xD;
      stimulation on approach-avoidance conflict in 20 adult patients who have undergone DBS&#xD;
      implantation for severe MDD and/or OCD. There are 100-200 patients in the world with DBS&#xD;
      electrodes in the VC/VS, and our research team cares for more than any other institution.&#xD;
      Both participant groups will be assessed with respect to reward-aversion decision conflict&#xD;
      using the task. The task will be performed with concurrent EEG recordings in DBS patients,&#xD;
      and with continuous recording through our invasive neurophysiology rig in EMU subjects.&#xD;

      DBS Patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will take place at a clinical office in the Charlestown Navy Yard (CNY), and will&#xD;
      consist of one 4 hour visit. Study staff will schedule a convenient time for patients to&#xD;
      arrive, or the research visit may be paired with a regularly scheduled DBS programming visit.&#xD;
      A member of the Division of Neurotherapeutics authorized to manipulate DBS programming will&#xD;
      turn the device on and off during the study. The subject's therapeutic parameters of the DBS&#xD;
      system will not be changed. The subject will be asked to complete several questionnaires Beck&#xD;
      Depression Inventory-II, Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology, Snaith Hamilton&#xD;
      Pleasure Scale, Mood and Anxiety Symptoms Questionnaire, and the Cognitive-Behavioral&#xD;
      Avoidance Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following these questionnaires, a member of the study staff will teach the subjects to&#xD;
      perform a modified version of the Approach-Avoidance task (adapted from Aupperle et al., in&#xD;
      press and Amemori &amp; Graybiel, 2012). Participants will be given a choice between a monetary&#xD;
      reward (approach condition) plus an aversive stimulus (mild electric current further&#xD;
      described below) or no monetary reward plus no aversive stimulus (avoid condition). Two&#xD;
      partially filled rectangles (one red and one blue) will indicate the relative amount of&#xD;
      potential punishment and reward. Subjects will use a joystick to direct a circle from a&#xD;
      center fixation point to select either a plus sign associated with the approach condition or&#xD;
      a square associated with the avoid condition. Subjects therefore control the outcome of each&#xD;
      trial and whether or not they receive any aversive stimuli. After the task, participants will&#xD;
      complete the AAC Task: Post-Questionnaire (adapted from Aupperle et al.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aversive stimulus is delivered in the form of a mild half second stimulation to the ankle&#xD;
      at a level of their choice that is uncomfortable but not painful. This electrical current is&#xD;
      produced by the Digitimer DS8R Constant Current Stimulator (Digitimer North America, LLC. Ft.&#xD;
      Lauderdale, FL). Its previous model DS71 has been safely implemented in studies with&#xD;
      previously MGH-approved IRB's (Milad et al., 2013). Patients will complete the task with DBS&#xD;
      ON and DBS OFF. Because we are not changing the therapeutic parameters of stimulation,&#xD;
      subjects should not experience any changes during the ON condition. Should any discomfort&#xD;
      arise in the OFF condition, the subject will be able to terminate the study and return to the&#xD;
      ON condition immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electroencephalography recordings (EEG) will be collected at 1450 Hz throughout the task in&#xD;
      the ON and OFF conditions, using a Brain Research Products 96-channel active EEG system.&#xD;
      Before each task run, we will also collect eyes-open and eyes-closed resting data, aiming for&#xD;
      at least 1 min of data free from any eyeblink, muscle, or other artifact. All recordings will&#xD;
      take place in a sound-isolated room, with careful scalp and electrode preparation to keep&#xD;
      impedances under 5 kΏ. Ground/references will be in the midline to minimize hemispheric&#xD;
      effects, and simultaneous EOG will permit blink/eyeroll artifact correction. The EEG system&#xD;
      includes a camera, tracking devices, and software optimized for registration. All electrode&#xD;
      positions will be digitized and referenced to subjects' pre-operative MRIs, enabling&#xD;
      source-localized analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epilepsy Patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will administer the same Ap-Av task in 20 epilepsy patients undergoing implantation of&#xD;
      depth electrodes for seizure monitoring in the Epilepsy Monitoring Unit at MGH. Epilepsy unit&#xD;
      experiments will involve both recording and stimulation. Recordings with the Ap-Av task will&#xD;
      be collected throughout the clinical stay. At the end of the stay, there are 1-2 days when&#xD;
      the patient resumes anti-seizure medications and the risk of a stimulation induced seizure is&#xD;
      low. On those days, we will attempt to modify task behavior through stimulation. Based on our&#xD;
      prior experience, we expect to test 1-2 stimulation targets per patient. In the first 10&#xD;
      patients, we will seek to replicate results that pregenual ACC stimulation leads to increased&#xD;
      avoidance. On a randomly selected 50% of trials (interleaved so that patients are blind to&#xD;
      stimulation), we will bilaterally stimulate the pregenual ACC (single bipolar pair per&#xD;
      hemisphere) at 130 Hz and 2 mA, for 600 ms during cue presentation. In the subsequent 10&#xD;
      patients, we will attempt to extend the result that dACC theta power predicts approach&#xD;
      behavior. When theta power rises above a set threshold (determined during the recording-only&#xD;
      days), we will again stimulate the pACC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients who have been implanted with clinical intracranial electrodes (whether or not&#xD;
      they have also been implanted with research electrodes), additional scalp electrodes may be&#xD;
      used. Usually, some electrodes are placed on the scalp for clinical purposes (as decided on&#xD;
      by the clinical team). Patients receiving depth electrodes, for example, usually receive a&#xD;
      standard set of scalp electrodes as well. However, if the clinical team decides that only a&#xD;
      very small number of electrodes are needed for their purposes we may supplement this further&#xD;
      with less than 10 additional electrodes. For this purpose, routinely-used clinical scalp&#xD;
      electrodes (including EOG and EMG) will be employed. The exact number and placement will be&#xD;
      constrained by clinical parameters. Specifically, regions close to any wound will be avoided&#xD;
      to minimize the risk of infection. Also, as the clinical recording systems have limited&#xD;
      numbers of channels, additional recording electrodes will be limited to what channels are&#xD;
      available. In cases where a full set of scalp electrodes are used, the amount of time they&#xD;
      are on the patient's head will be limited to approximately one day to decrease the risk of&#xD;
      infection. This additional recording will be done one day before the scheduled date for&#xD;
      removal of the intracranial electrodes.&#xD;
