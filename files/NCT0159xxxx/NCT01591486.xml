  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low-dose aspirin (ASA) has emerged as the most important cause of peptic ulcer bleeding&#xD;
      worldwide. In western countries, ASA has overtaken non steroidal antiinflammatory drugs&#xD;
      (NSAIDs) as a major cause of peptic ulcer bleeding in the elderly population [1,2].&#xD;
      Management of peptic ulcer bleeding in patients receiving ASA for cardiothrombotic diseases&#xD;
      is a clinical dilemma. In a randomized trial of continuous versus interrupted ASA therapy&#xD;
      after endoscopic treatment of peptic ulcer bleeding, patients who discontinued ASA had a&#xD;
      10-fold increased incidence of all-cause mortality compared to those who received continuous&#xD;
      ASA therapy. On the other hand, patients receiving continuous ASA therapy had a two-fold&#xD;
      increased risk of early rebleeding [3]. Thus, preventing the occurrence of peptic ulcer&#xD;
      bleeding in ASA users is important in reducing morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the uncertain clinical utility of Helicobacter Pylori (Hp) testing in ASA users, this&#xD;
      prospective cohort study aims to determine whether testing for Hp will have any impact on the&#xD;
      long-term incidence of ulcer bleeding in ASA users with high ulcer risk. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that among ASA users with Hp infection and ulcer bleeding, the long-term&#xD;
      incidence of recurrent ulcer bleeding with ASA use will be low after eradication of Hp alone.&#xD;

      Low-dose aspirin (ASA) has emerged as the most important cause of peptic ulcer bleeding&#xD;
      worldwide. In western countries, ASA has overtaken NSAIDs as a major cause of peptic ulcer&#xD;
      bleeding in the elderly population [1,2]. Management of peptic ulcer bleeding in patients&#xD;
      receiving ASA for cardiothrombotic diseases is a clinical dilemma. In a randomized trial of&#xD;
      continuous versus interrupted ASA therapy after endoscopic treatment of peptic ulcer&#xD;
      bleeding, patients who discontinued ASA had a 10-fold increased incidence of all-cause&#xD;
      mortality compared to those who received continuous ASA therapy. On the other hand, patients&#xD;
      receiving continuous ASA therapy had a two-fold increased risk of early rebleeding [3]. Thus,&#xD;
      preventing the occurrence of peptic ulcer bleeding in ASA users is important in reducing&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emerging evidence from secondary analysis of cardiovascular trials suggests that aspirin also&#xD;
      reduces the risk of all cancers, even at cardioprotective doses [4]. With increasing use of&#xD;
      ASA for cardiothrombotic diseases and cancer prevention, the global burden of ASA-associated&#xD;
      peptic ulcer disease is expected to increase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of risk factors are known to increase the risk of peptic ulcer bleeding with ASA&#xD;
      use. These include a history of peptic ulcer or ulcer bleeding, old age, renal failure,&#xD;
      concurrent use of ASA and clopidogrel, and Helicobacter pylori (Hp) infection [5-7]. Among&#xD;
      these risk factors, concomitant use of clopidogrel and a history of peptic ulcer bleeding and&#xD;
      are important predictors of ulcer bleeding with ASA use [7]. On the other hand, Hp is the&#xD;
      only risk factor that can be modified. Eradication of Hp therefore offers a hope of reducing&#xD;
      the risk of ulcer bleeding in ASA users.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current European and U.S. guidelines unanimously recommend test-and-treat Hp infection in ASA&#xD;
      users who are at risk of ulcer bleeding [8-10]. Despite these guidelines, the long-term&#xD;
      benefit of eradicating Hp in high-risk ASA users is uncertain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a 6-month randomized trial of ASA users with Hp infection complicated by ulcer bleeding,&#xD;
      patients were randomized to one-week of Hp eradication therapy alone or maintenance treatment&#xD;
      with omeprazole after ulcers has healed. Our results showed that the incidence of recurrent&#xD;
      ulcer bleeding was comparable between the group receiving Hp eradication alone (1.9%) and the&#xD;
      group receiving omeprazole (0.9%) [11]. In another 12-month randomized trial, ASA users with&#xD;
      Hp infection complicated by ulcer bleeding were randomized to one-week of eradication therapy&#xD;
      alone or one week of eradication therapy plus maintenance treatment with lansoprazole. In&#xD;
      this study, up to 15% of ASA users developed recurrent ulcer bleeding after eradication of Hp&#xD;
      alone. Among the ASA users who developed recurrent ulcer bleeding, however, over two-thirds&#xD;
      had failure Hp eradication or used concomitant NSAIDs [12].&#xD;
&#xD;
      In light of these conflicting findings, current guidelines recommend that co-therapy with a&#xD;
      proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) is still needed in high-risk ASA users after eradication of Hp&#xD;
      [8-10]. Since PPIs are more effective in preventing ASA-associated ulcers in the presence of&#xD;
      Hp infection [13], the clinical relevance of testing for Hp in high-risk ASA users becomes&#xD;
      even more questionable. To date, the strategy of test-and-treat Hp for ASA users is not&#xD;
      popular among primary care doctors or specialists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One alternative gastroprotective strategy is to prescribe PPIs to all ASA users at high risk&#xD;
      of ulcer bleeding and ignore Hp testing. However, poor compliance to gastroprotective&#xD;
      co-therapy limits its effectiveness. Recently, health authorities issued warning about the&#xD;
      the use of PPI and the risk of hip fractures and potential adverse drug-interactions between&#xD;
      PPI and clopidogrel [14,15]. Clopidgorel is commonly used in combination with ASA for&#xD;
      preventing coronary stent thrombosis but dual anti-platelet therapy will substantially&#xD;
      increase the risk of ulcer bleeding [5]. If eradication of Hp can reduce the long-term risk&#xD;
      of ulcer bleeding with ASA use, there may be a potential hope of limiting PPI use to very&#xD;
      high risk ASA users.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the uncertain clinical utility of Hp testing in ASA users, this prospective cohort&#xD;
      study aims to determine whether testing for Hp will have any impact on the long-term&#xD;
      incidence of ulcer bleeding in ASA users with high ulcer risk. The investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that among ASA users with Hp infection and ulcer bleeding, the long-term incidence of&#xD;
      recurrent ulcer bleeding with ASA use will be low after eradication of Hp alone.&#xD;

    <description>Hp-negative cohort&#xD;
The second cohort consists of ASA users with ulcer bleeding but no current or past Hp infection, as evidenced by:&#xD;
negative rapid urease test&#xD;
negative histology for Hp infection on both initial and follow-up endoscopy&#xD;
negative serology test&#xD;
absence of intestinal metaplasia and atrophy on 4 random biopsies of the antrum and corpus&#xD;
After ulcer healing, the Hp-negative cohort will receive enteric-coated ASA (&lt;160 mg daily) without regular co-prescription of anti-ulcer drugs.</description>

    <description>Hp-eradicated cohort This cohort consists of ASA users with ulcer bleeding and Hp infection who have healed ulcers and successful eradication of Hp on follow-up endoscopy. They will receive plain ASA (&lt;160 mg daily) without co-prescription of anti-ulcer drugs.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Average-risk cohort</arm_group_label>
    <description>Average-risk cohort The third cohort consists of ASA-naive patients without a history of ulcer who attend the general outpatient clinic. They require long-term ASA for established cardiothrombotic diseases. They receive plain ASA (&lt;160 mg daily) without co-prescription of anti-ulcer drugs. Hp status will not be determined in this cohort because Hp testing is not justified in average-risk asymptomatic patients.</description>
