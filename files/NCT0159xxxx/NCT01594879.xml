  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective multicenter trial has been started in Korea to investigate the treatment&#xD;
      efficacy of Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) plus Medroxyprogesterone&#xD;
      Acetate(MPA) in Young Women with Early Stage Endometrial Cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard treatment for endometrial cancer is total hysterectomy and bilateral&#xD;
      salpingo-oophorectomy, peritoneal cytology, and lymph node dissection. However, young&#xD;
      patients who desire to preserve their potential for fertility may find this standard&#xD;
      treatment difficult to accept. Therefore, the conservative treatment for these patients has&#xD;
      remained a challenge. A number of studies have reported the effectiveness of hormonal therapy&#xD;
      using systemic progestin in women clinically diagnosed with early endometrial adenocarcinoma&#xD;
      at stage IA, grade 1, who want to maintain reproductive potential. In addition, several&#xD;
      recent studies reported the use of LNG-IUS to treat patients at a high risk of perioperative&#xD;
      complications who cannot tolerate systemic progesterone because of its adverse effects.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, there has been no prospective multicenter trial that investigated the&#xD;
      effectiveness of treatment with systemic progesterone in combination with intrauterine&#xD;
      progesterone in young women with endometrial cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators conducted a prospective trial of the treatment of the presumably&#xD;
      early-stage grade 1 endometrial cancer in young women who desire to preserve fertility by&#xD;
      using oral MPA in combination with LNG-IUS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Young patients with histologically confirmed grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma that is&#xD;
      presumably confined to the endometrium, who desired to preserve fertility potential go&#xD;
      through LNG-IUS insertion and are administered MPA at a dosage of 500 mg/d concurrently.&#xD;
      Follow-up and treatment response assessment were implemented at a 3-month interval with&#xD;
      office endometrial aspiration biopsy with LNG-IUS in place and dilatation and curettage after&#xD;
      removal of LNG-IUS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is response rate. Secondary endpoint is to estimate the consistency of&#xD;
      the results between office endometrial aspiration biopsy and dilatation and curettage (D&amp;C)&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;

      PURPOSE: This prospective study aims to analyze the treatment efficacy of LNG-IUS plus MPA in&#xD;
      Young Women with Early Stage Endometrial Cancer and to analyze the diagnostic accuracy of&#xD;
      office endometrial aspiration biopsy with LNG-IUS in place compared with dilatation and&#xD;
      curettage after removal of LNG-IUS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ENDPOINTS: The primary endpoints of this study is response rate. Secondary endpoint is to&#xD;
      estimate the consistency of the results between office endometrial aspiration biopsy and&#xD;
      dilatation and curettage (D&amp;C) procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY SETTING AND PROTOCOL REVIEW: This study is a single arm, prospective&#xD;
      multi-institutional study. Its protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of&#xD;
      each clinical trial institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PLANNED CLINICAL TRIAL PERIOD: Patient Selection and Enrollment: 24 month after IRB approval&#xD;
      of clinical trial Institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TREATMENT METHODS: Patients with histologically confirmed grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma&#xD;
      that is presumably confined to the endometrium went through LNG-IUS insertion and were&#xD;
      administered MPA at a dosage of 500 mg/day concurrently. Follow-up and treatment response&#xD;
      assessment were implemented at a 3-month interval with transvaginal ultrasonography,&#xD;
      endometrial aspiration biopsy with LNG-IUS in place and D&amp;C after removal of LNG-IUS. The&#xD;
      biopsy findings are compared.&#xD;

      INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. General Name/Brand name: Mirena - SCHERING&#xD;
&#xD;
           Active ingredient: levonorgestrel 52mg&#xD;
&#xD;
           Description: Mirena is a hormone-releasing T-shaped intrauterine system. A removal&#xD;
           thread is attached to a loop at the end of the vertical stem of the T-body.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. General Name/Brand name:Farlutal tab. 500mg/ Pfizer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Active ingredient: Medroxyprogesterone Acetate&#xD;
&#xD;
      PLANNED NUMBER OF SUBJECT 39 patients with biopsy proven grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma&#xD;
      that is presumably confined to the endometrium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS The primary objective of this study is to estimate the treatment&#xD;
      efficacy of the oral MPA in combination with LNG-IUS in early stage endometrial cancer in&#xD;
      terms of their response rate. The sample size needed for this estimation would be 39 patients&#xD;
      after considering 10% of follow-up loss. The Secondary objective is to estimate the&#xD;
      consistency of the office endometrial aspiration biopsy and D&amp;C. Kappa statistics will be&#xD;
      used&#xD;
