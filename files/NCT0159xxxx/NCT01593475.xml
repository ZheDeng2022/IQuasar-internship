    <textblock>
      This phase II trial chose the induction chemotherapy with gemcitabine and cisplatin followed&#xD;
      by Chemoradiotherapy (CRT) with gemcitabine to optimize the treatment for pancreas cancer&#xD;
      patients with locally advanced disease and the purpose of this trial is to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy of induction CT with gemcitabine and cisplatin followed by CRT for unresectable&#xD;
      pancreatic carcinoma.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary endpoint is feasibility and compliance of induction chemotherapy with gemcitabine&#xD;
      and cisplatin followed by CRT for locally advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer. Previous&#xD;
      studies showed that approximately 20% of patients with locally advanced disease developed the&#xD;
      early distant metastasis.[6, 7] Thus, it will be expected that at least 80% of total patients&#xD;
      will be eligible for induction chemotherapy after completion of induction chemotherapy. An&#xD;
      experimental arm that result a compliance of 80% would merit further study. If the true&#xD;
      compliance rate of the patients who will eligible for CRT is ≤ 60%, null hypothesis will be&#xD;
      rejected with a power of 80% and a type I error of 5%. Thus, the required number of evaluable&#xD;
      patients is 24. Considering the 10% follow-up loss and 20% distant metastasis rate after&#xD;
      induction chemotherapy, a total of 34 eligible patients will be enrolled.&#xD;
