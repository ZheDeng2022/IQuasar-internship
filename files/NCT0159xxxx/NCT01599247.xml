      Specific aim #1: To assess the study team's ability to recruit subjects in this cohort and to&#xD;
      successfully complete follow-up assessments by phone or mail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Over 50% of eligible subjects will enroll in the observational study, and 70% of&#xD;
      follow-up assessments will be successfully completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aim #2: To determine the natural history of hopelessness, ongoing suicidal thoughts,&#xD;
      and optimism in subjects at 2, 4 and 8 weeks after discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Subjects will continue to have moderate levels of hopelessness, suicidal&#xD;
      thoughts, and optimism at follow-up assessments.&#xD;

      Contact information. On the day of enrollment, contact information (address, phone number)&#xD;
      will be obtained from the subject. Subjects will also be asked to provide the contact&#xD;
      information for a family member or friend who the study team may contact in case of emergency&#xD;
      or if unable to get in touch with subject at follow up. Subjects unable to provide contact&#xD;
      information for at least one family member will not be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the date of enrollment, study staff will obtain two types of information:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Baseline clinical characteristics. Study staff will obtain specific clinical variables&#xD;
           from the patient to gather information about variables that could impact levels of&#xD;
           hopelessness/optimism after discharge. These variables include: age, gender, # of prior&#xD;
           admissions [zero, 1-5, more than 5], presence of substance use disorder (assessed via&#xD;
           inpatient chart review), admission for suicide attempt or suicidal ideation only, and&#xD;
           involvement in exercises that can increase feelings of well-being like gratitude,&#xD;
           forgiveness, using one's personal strengths, and acts of kindness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Baseline outcome measures: Study staff will also administer six instruments:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS):14 This is a 21-item scale used to assess feelings of&#xD;
                hopelessness.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Concise Health Risk Tracking Scale (CHRT):15 This is a 12 item scale used to assess&#xD;
                the presence and intensity of suicidal thoughts.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Life Orientation Test-Revised (LOT-R):16 This is a 10-item scale that measures&#xD;
                optimism (and pessimism).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Positive Affect Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS):17 This is a well-validated&#xD;
                20-item self-report measure of more general positive and negative affect.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Sheehan Disability Scale:18 This is a 5 item scale used to assess the degree to&#xD;
                which the subject's condition or disease (psychological, social, physical) has&#xD;
                impacted his or her functioning in daily life.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology, Self Report (QIDS-SR):19 This is a&#xD;
                16-item questionnaire that assesses the subject's depressive symptoms. It will&#xD;
                serve as an additional reliable, valid way to gather information on the subject's&#xD;
                mood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This evaluation should take approximately 20-30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up assessments will occur by phone or mail at 2 weeks, 4 weeks and 8 weeks. Similar to&#xD;
      initial assessments, the follow-up assessments will have two components:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assessment of characteristics: Study staff will inquire about subjects' living situation&#xD;
           at discharge (homelessness, living alone), employment/academic status, treatment&#xD;
           postdischarge (follow-up with therapist, psychiatrist, PCP, groups, AA/NA, partial&#xD;
           hospital programs, and other treatment and forms of peer support), and involvement in&#xD;
           exercises that can increase feelings of well-being like gratitude, forgiveness, using&#xD;
           one's personal strengths, and acts of kindness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assessment of study outcomes: Staff will readminister the five measures above, and will&#xD;
           also inquire about psychiatric readmissions, suicide attempts, and episodes of self-harm&#xD;
           (cutting, burning, banging/hitting body parts, ingesting toxic materials/objects, and&#xD;
           other intentional non-suicidal self-harm behaviors). This evaluation should take 20-30&#xD;
           minutes.&#xD;
