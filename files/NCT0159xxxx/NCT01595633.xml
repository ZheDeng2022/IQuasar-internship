      In Korea, the number of suboptimal responders to rescue combination therapy is also&#xD;
      increasing. As a matter of fact, according to the investigations in Korea, HBV DNA&#xD;
      undetectability at 48 weeks of adefovir and lamivudine combination rescue therapy for&#xD;
      patients with lamivudine resistance was reported to be only 32.4%, which suggested that the&#xD;
      appropriate another rescue therapy might be urgently required. However, there is no promising&#xD;
      oral antiviral agents to control these patients in Asia-Pacific region, where tenofovir is&#xD;
      not widely available. Tenofovir has a higher potent antiviral efficacy and a negligible drug&#xD;
      resistance rate. The switch from adefovir to tenofovir in patients who have insufficient&#xD;
      hepatitis B virus (HBV) suppression (HBV DNA ≥ 60 IU/mL by PCR) may lead to increased viral&#xD;
      suppression or more HBeAg loss/seroconversion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Here, the investigators aimed to conduct a randomized study on evaluating the antiviral&#xD;
      efficacy, safety, and tolerability of switching from adefovir to tenofovir in chronic&#xD;
      hepatitis B patients who have suboptimal response to adefovir-based combination rescue&#xD;
      therapy due to nucleoside analogues Resistance (SATIS study).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The major goal of antiviral therapy against chronic hepatitis B is to suppress viral&#xD;
      replications successfully, ultimately preventing the chronic liver damage, development of&#xD;
      liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. In Korea, the number of multi-drug resistant&#xD;
      CHB has been rapidly increased last few years. It is because that the national health&#xD;
      insurance coverage is very limited for the patients who experienced primary treatment&#xD;
      failure. The only switch to adefovir has been allowed in lamivudine resistant patients and&#xD;
      thus this sequential rescue therapy generated multi-drug resistance to both adefovir and&#xD;
      another drugs. Thus, nowadays, add-on therapy rather than switch therapy might be preferred&#xD;
      from major guidelines in this point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the number of suboptimal responders to rescue combination therapy is also&#xD;
      increasing. As a matter of fact, according to the investigations in Korea, HBV DNA&#xD;
      undetectability at 48 weeks of adefovir and lamivudine combination rescue therapy for&#xD;
      patients with lamivudine resistance was reported to be only 32.4%, which suggested that the&#xD;
      appropriate another rescue therapy might be urgently required. However, there is no promising&#xD;
      oral antiviral agents to control these patients in Asia-Pacific region, where tenofovir is&#xD;
      not widely available. Tenofovir has a higher potent antiviral efficacy and a negligible drug&#xD;
      resistance rate. It belongs to the different class compared to other oral nucleoside&#xD;
      analogues (NAs) such as lamivudine, telbivudine, clevudine and entecavir. The switch from&#xD;
      adefovir to tenofovir in patients who have insufficient hepatitis B virus (HBV) suppression&#xD;
      (HBV DNA ≥ 60 IU/mL by PCR) may lead to increased viral suppression or more HBeAg&#xD;
      loss/seroconversion. The results of this study will provide a rationale for switch from&#xD;
      adefovir to tenofovir in combination to another drug continued (lamivudine, telbivudine,&#xD;
      clevudine and entecavir).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Here, the investigators aimed to conduct a randomized study on evaluating the antiviral&#xD;
      efficacy, safety, and tolerability of switching from adefovir to tenofovir in chronic&#xD;
      hepatitis B patients who have suboptimal response to adefovir-based combination rescue&#xD;
      therapy due to nucleoside analogues Resistance (SATIS study).&#xD;
