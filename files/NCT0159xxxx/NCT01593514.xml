  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The bacterium (germ) Neisseria meningitidis causes meningitis and blood poisoning. N&#xD;
      meningitidis is classified into different serogroups (types), based on its outer&#xD;
      polysaccharide (carbohydrate) capsule. Serogroups A,B,C,W &amp; Y are responsible for the vast&#xD;
      majority of meningococcal disease worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Older vaccines against types A,C,W &amp; Y contain part of the polysaccharide capsule of the&#xD;
      germ. However, these polysaccharide vaccines do not provide long-term protection against&#xD;
      disease and are less effective in young children, the group most at risk of meningococcal&#xD;
      disease. Newer &quot;conjugate&quot; ACWY vaccines attach a polysaccharide to a protein carrier - these&#xD;
      provoke a good response in young children and can provide long-term protection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      White blood cells called B cells produce antibodies, which are the main components of&#xD;
      protection against meningococcal disease. Although many studies have investigated the immune&#xD;
      response to these vaccines in different age groups by measuring specific antibodies, there is&#xD;
      limited information about the B cells underlying such an immune response. Several different&#xD;
      subsets (populations) of B cells exist in the blood. Previous studies by the investigators&#xD;
      group suggest that different numbers of B cells are produced in response to each vaccine&#xD;
      type. However, little is understood about which subset of B cell is important for antibody&#xD;
      production in response to these polysaccharide or conjugate vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to provide detailed information on the immune response to meningococcal&#xD;
      vaccines by investigating the appearance of B cells and their subsets in the blood after&#xD;
      vaccination with the polysaccharide and conjugate vaccines. These observations will help us&#xD;
      understand how polysaccharide and conjugate vaccines stimulate the immune system in different&#xD;
      ways. This knowledge will help in the development of new vaccines that are effective across&#xD;
      all age groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to recruit 20 adults aged 30-70 from Oxfordshire. The study will be&#xD;
      funded by the Oxford Vaccine Group.&#xD;

      EPIDEMIOLOGY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neisseria meningitidis is a globally important cause of meningitis and septicaemia. The&#xD;
      polysaccharide capsule is an important virulence factor in causing invasive disease. The&#xD;
      serogroup of a meningococcal strain is determined by the biochemical composition of the&#xD;
      polysaccharide capsule. There are 13 diverse polysaccharide capsules but only A, B, C, W and&#xD;
      Y commonly cause invasive infections. In particular serogroups A,C,W, &amp; Y account for &gt;70% of&#xD;
      meningococcal disease in North America, serogroups B &amp; C are responsible for the vast&#xD;
      majority of disease in Europe and Serogroup A causes cyclical meningitis epidemics in the&#xD;
      African meningitis belt, including the recent outbreak in 2009/2010.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the rapid progression and serious sequelae of meningococcal disease, primary prevention&#xD;
      is vital and this is most effectively achieved by vaccination. In the absence of a serogroup&#xD;
      B vaccine, quadrivalent vaccines against serogroups ACW &amp; Y represent the broadest mechanism&#xD;
      of control of meningococcal disease worldwide. Protection induced by these vaccines relies on&#xD;
      anti-capsular polysaccharide antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MENINGOCOCCAL POLYSACCHARIDE AND CONJUGATE VACCINES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Polysaccharide ACWY vaccines consist of pure capsular polysaccharide from each of the four&#xD;
      serogroups and have been in widespread use since the late 1970's. However, in common with&#xD;
      polysaccharide vaccines against other encapsulated bacteria, meningococcal polysaccharide&#xD;
      vaccines are poorly immunogenic in young children, do not provoke long lasting immune&#xD;
      responses[5] and may not reduce nasopharyngeal carriage. Newer conjugate vaccines consist of&#xD;
      capsular oligosaccharides chemically linked to a protein carrier. Conjugation of a&#xD;
      polysaccharide to a protein carrier allows the recruitment of cognate T cell help with&#xD;
      subsequent exposure to antigen provoking a potentiated antibody response and immunological&#xD;
      memory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to investigate novel aspects of the B cell immune responses to meningococcal&#xD;
      polysaccharide and conjugate vaccines. To achieve this, we will administer a quadrivalent&#xD;
      ACWY polysaccharide vaccine (MenACWY-PS), and a quadrivalent ACWY conjugate vaccine&#xD;
      (MenACWY-CRM) containing capsular oligosaccharides of serogroups A, C, W-135 &amp; Y conjugated&#xD;
      to a CRM197 mutant diphtheria toxoid carrier to adult volunteers. Each of these vaccines&#xD;
      contains different amounts of capsular antigen (see Table 1). The polysaccharide vaccine has&#xD;
      50µg of polysaccharide from each of the 4 serogroups, while the conjugate has 10µg of A and&#xD;
      5µg of each of C, W &amp; Y.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent trial using MenACWY-PS and MenACWY-CRM conducted by the Oxford Vaccine Group&#xD;
      (Understanding the Immune Response to Meningitis Vaccines, OXREC 09/H0606/20, Eudract&#xD;
      2007-001349-17) showed preliminary evidence of a difference in B cell responses to&#xD;
      polysaccharide and conjugate meningococcal vaccines. However, a confounding factor in&#xD;
      interpreting the data from this trial has been the difference in the amount of capsular&#xD;
      antigen contained in each of the two types of vaccine used in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Full dose MenACWY-PS Polysaccharide vaccine has 50µg each of MenA, MenC,MenW and MenY&#xD;
      capsular antigen. MenACWY-CRM Conjugate vaccine contains 10µg of MenA capsular antigen and&#xD;
      5µg each of MenC, MenW and MenY.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study is designed to compare both the full dose MenACWY-PS and a 1/5th dose of&#xD;
      MenACWY-PS (which contains 10µg of each serogroup) to a full dose of MenACWY-CRM. This will&#xD;
      differentiate between a polysaccharide dose-dependent response and a true polysaccharide&#xD;
      vaccine vs. conjugate vaccine response. In particular, we aim to investigate the thymus&#xD;
      dependent or thymus independent nature of the immune response to polysaccharide and conjugate&#xD;
      meningococcal vaccines respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      THYMUS INDEPENDENT AND THYMUS DEPENDENT IMMUNE RESPONSES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thymus independent (TI) antigens are defined by their ability to induce immune responses in&#xD;
      T-cell deficient or athymic mice. In common with other high molecular weight molecules with&#xD;
      repetitive structures, polysaccharide vaccine antigens are further classified as Type 2 TI&#xD;
      antigens. The repetitive polysaccharide epitopes cross-link the BCR of antigen specific B&#xD;
      cells, triggering activation signals and stimulating proliferation and differentiation into&#xD;
      antibody-secreting plasma cells. The absence of T cell help precludes the generation of&#xD;
      memory B cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TI responses are thought to be largely mediated by marginal zone B cells (MZB), which mature&#xD;
      in the marginal zone of the spleen. This compartment is poorly developed in children under&#xD;
      two years of age, which results in an ineffective anti-polysaccharide immune response in this&#xD;
      age group. Murine studies have revealed an important role for a further subset of mature B&#xD;
      cells, B1b cells, in adaptive immunity . Unlike the development of conventional B cell&#xD;
      memory, which requires the formation of germinal centres and T cells, the development of B1b&#xD;
      cell-mediated long-lasting antibody responses occur independently of T cell- help.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In contrast, conjugate vaccines act as thymus dependent (TD) antigens. Binding of the&#xD;
      polysaccharide moiety to antigen specific B cell receptors allows uptake of the&#xD;
      polysaccharide protein conjugate and processing via the classical MHC class II pathway.&#xD;
      Peptides derived from the carrier protein are presented to cognate CD4+ T helper cells, which&#xD;
      provide signals for further B cell differentiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TD responses are mediated by follicular B cells (FOB), with generation of antibody secreting&#xD;
      plasma cells and memory B cells, capable of responding to further specific antigenic&#xD;
      challenge[10]. Recent work conducted at the Oxford Vaccine Group suggests that pneumococcal&#xD;
      polysaccharide and conjugate vaccines induce B1b and FOB cells, respectively. This study will&#xD;
      investigate whether this also holds true for meningococcal conjugate and polysaccharide&#xD;
      vaccines. This will be done by analysing the different populations of B cells produced in&#xD;
      response to the full dose polysaccharide vaccine, 1/5th polysaccharide vaccine and conjugate&#xD;
      vaccine using novel immunological techniques developed in our laboratories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPORESPONSIVENESS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vaccine-induced hyporesponsiveness is the inability to mount a booster response of at least&#xD;
      the same magnitude as that produced to the priming dose. Previous vaccination with&#xD;
      meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine has been shown to impair antibody responses to&#xD;
      subsequent meningococcal polysaccharide or conjugate vaccines. The design of this study will&#xD;
      allow investigation of the phenomenon of polysaccharide induced hyporesponsiveness in&#xD;
      quadrivalent meningococcal vaccines at the level of memory B cell and plasma cell responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SEROGROUP A&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unlike the sialic acid based polysaccharide capsules of serogroups B, C, W-135 &amp; Y, serogroup&#xD;
      A meningococcal capsules are composed of N-acetyl mannosamine phosphate. Plain serogroup A&#xD;
      polysaccharide vaccines show unexpected immunogenicity in young infants.These results suggest&#xD;
      that perhaps due to its chemical structure, group A polysaccharide may not be handled by the&#xD;
      immune system as a classic TI antigen. This study will test the hypothesis that follicular B&#xD;
      cells are produced in response to the serogroup A component of MenACWY-PS, and by contrast,&#xD;
      marginal zone or B1b cells are produced in response to the serogroup C component of the same&#xD;
      vaccine. This study will also test the hypothesis that follicular B cells are produced in&#xD;
      response to serogroups A and C components of MenACWY-CRM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANTIBODY REPERTOIRE&#xD;
&#xD;
      The human humoral response is anticipatory; potential specific antibody exists prior to&#xD;
      encountering the extensive collection of antigen encountered over the lifetime of an&#xD;
      individual. The basis for this diverse repertoire is the multiple gene segments comprising&#xD;
      the variable region of the antibody molecule. The potential for each V D &amp; J segment to&#xD;
      combine randomly introduces combinatorial diversity to the repertoire. During rearrangement,&#xD;
      further nucleotides may be added to or removed from the junction of the gene segments, termed&#xD;
      junctional diversity. Furthermore, during maturation of the antibody response, somatic&#xD;
      hypermutation of the variable region occurs during B cell proliferation in the germinal&#xD;
      centres. This underlies the increase in antibody affinity in secondary responses to antigen.&#xD;
      These mechanisms help create a potential repertoire of up to 1016 antibody molecules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have shown that the human humoral response to specific antigens is&#xD;
      restricted in diversity within the individual and across populations with a limited number of&#xD;
      antibody encoding variable region genes being utilised. These studies have relied on&#xD;
      traditional vector cloning and Sanger sequencing of rearranged heavy chain loci of single&#xD;
      cells, and are limited in the scope of their analysis of potential repertoire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Massive parallel sequencing and emulsion PCR are powerful new tools enabling large scale DNA&#xD;
      sequencing with the potential to simultaneously sequence up to one million reads per run.&#xD;
      These techniques have been applied to look at the potential antibody repertoire in zebrafish,&#xD;
      the human antibody repertoire in specific B cell subsets[20] and to assess clonality of&#xD;
      leukaemoid cells. This study aims to compare the VDJ repertoire in memory B cell populations&#xD;
      before and after polysaccharide and conjugate ACWY vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANALYSIS OF GENETIC INFLUENCES ON THE IMMUNE RESPONSE&#xD;
&#xD;
      A further aspect to be assessed in this study is the impact of genetic factors on the&#xD;
      response to immunisation. Twin studies on several vaccines including measles, mumps and&#xD;
      rubella, have shown high heritability of vaccine antibody responses. Some genetic&#xD;
      associations have already been identified between genes of the adaptive and innate immune&#xD;
      response and some vaccines, for example human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles and measles&#xD;
      antibody responses and IL-1β polymorphisms and hepatitis B vaccine responses. These studies&#xD;
      have been small scale and based on single candidate genes and the extent to which genetic&#xD;
      variation contributes to vaccine responses remains poorly understood. Insight into which&#xD;
      genetic variants affect responses to specific vaccines will help identify the critical immune&#xD;
      pathways leading to protection after vaccination and lead to the production of more effective&#xD;
      vaccines. In addition, the identification of genes that may play important roles in wild-type&#xD;
      infection will allow a better understanding of disease pathogenesis, which in turn may lead&#xD;
      to the development of novel therapies&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blood samples obtained in this study provide a source of DNA can then contribute to a DNA&#xD;
      bank pooling samples from multiple different Oxford Vaccine Group studies. These DNA samples&#xD;
      can then be used for genome wide analysis of the genetic factors influencing the host&#xD;
      response to the vaccines received in the relevant studies. This DNA extraction and storage&#xD;
      will only occur with the specific consent of participants, and DNA will not be analysed for&#xD;
      any other purpose than to assess factors influencing the immune response to vaccines. Serum&#xD;
      left over from separation of the cellular plug for DNA extraction will also be stored and&#xD;
      further immunological assays such as the quantification of functional antibody by serum&#xD;
      bactericidal activity may also be performed on them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUMMARY&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to investigate in detail aspects of the B cell response to conjugate and&#xD;
      polysaccharide quadrivalent meningococcal vaccines in healthy adults using a variety of novel&#xD;
      laboratory methods.&#xD;
