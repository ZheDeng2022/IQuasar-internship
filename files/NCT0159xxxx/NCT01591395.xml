      Inguinal hernia is one of the most common surgical diseases. Over the past years, the safety&#xD;
      and feasibility of laparoscopy was established and gaining popularity in recent few years.&#xD;
      Laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair was associated with less post operative pain, a shorter&#xD;
      recovery period, earlier return to normal daily activities and work, and better cosmetic&#xD;
      results. The laparoscopic hernia repair usually require three working ports ranging from 5 to&#xD;
      10 mm. However, with each increasing laparoscopic ports usually associated with possible&#xD;
      increasing morbidity and pain related to ports.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efforts are continuing to further reduce the port related morbidities and improve the&#xD;
      cosmetic outcomes of laparoscopic surgery, including reduction of the size and number of&#xD;
      ports. This has led to the evolution of a novel surgical approach now collectively known as&#xD;
      laparoendoscopic single site surgery. LESS has been performed for variable indications&#xD;
      including extirpative and reconstructive urologic procedure via the transperitoneal approach.&#xD;
      Early experience has demonstrated the feasibility as well as the safe and successful&#xD;
      completion of these LESS procedures. Although these initial reports are promising, the&#xD;
      clinical advantages of LESS procedures over conventional laparoscopic procedures have not&#xD;
      been defined. Therefore, we conducted a single center, randomized trial to compare the safety&#xD;
      and other outcomes after conventional laparoscopic and LESS inguinal hernia repair in adult&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

      Inguinal hernia is one of the most common surgical diseases in adult. Tension free&#xD;
      hernioplasty is regarded as gold standard of treatment in adult inguinal hernia. The reported&#xD;
      incidence of hernia recurrence after tension free repair is less than 5 percent. Over the&#xD;
      past years, the safety and feasibility of laparoscopy was established and gaining popularity&#xD;
      in recent few years. With the advancing technology, laparoscopic approach has become the&#xD;
      standard treatment for cholecystectomy and adrenalectomy. Laparoscopic procedures improved&#xD;
      surgical precision through enhanced visualization, magnification and limited exposure,&#xD;
      dissection. Laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair was associated with less postoperative pain,&#xD;
      a shorter recovery period, earlier return to normal daily activities and work, and better&#xD;
      cosmetic results. The laparoscopic hernia repair usually require three working ports ranging&#xD;
      from 5 to 10 mm. However, with each increasing laparoscopic ports usually associated with&#xD;
      possible increasing morbidity and pain related to ports.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efforts are continuing to further reduce the port related morbidities and improve the&#xD;
      cosmetic outcomes of laparoscopic surgery, including reduction of the size and number of&#xD;
      ports. This has led to the evolution of a novel surgical approach now collectively known as&#xD;
      laparoendoscopic single-site surgery. LESS has been performed for variable indications&#xD;
      including extirpative and reconstructive urologic procedure via the transperitoneal approach.&#xD;
      Early experience has demonstrated the feasibility as well as the safe and successful&#xD;
      completion of these LESS procedures. Although these initial reports are promising, the&#xD;
      clinical advantages of LESS procedures over conventional laparoscopic procedures have not&#xD;
      been defined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, LESS hernia repair had been rarely reported in the literature except in some case&#xD;
      reports and one small series. Although these initial reports revealed that LESS hernia repair&#xD;
      is safe and feasible in adult inguinal hernia, the definite clinical benefits of LESS hernia&#xD;
      repair could not be identified in these small and short term reports. Thus, a prospective&#xD;
      randomized trial comparing LESS and conventional multiport laparoscopic hernia repair with&#xD;
      long-term follow up was mandatory to define the clinical advantages of LESS hernia repair.&#xD;
      Therefore, we conducted a randomized trial to compare LESS total extraperitoneal hernia&#xD;
      repair and conventional multiport TEP repair in adult inguinal hernia with inflammatory,&#xD;
      gonadal responses, complication rate and recurrence rate and pain score, functional status&#xD;
      and activity level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall Goal&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To compare the surgical outcomes, patient center outcomes and surgery induced inflammatory ,&#xD;
      gonadal responses after LESS TEP and conventional multiport TEP hernia repair in adult.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the surgery induced inflammatory responses after LESS TEP and conventional&#xD;
           multiport TEP hernia repair with inflammatory markers by blood sampling before and after&#xD;
           operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the surgery induced testicle changes in male adults after LESS TEP and&#xD;
           conventional multiport TEP hernia repair with color Doppler ultrasonography to determine&#xD;
           testicular volume and resistive index before surgery and 3 months postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the postoperative pain score after LESS TEP and conventional multiport TEP&#xD;
           hernia repair with Visual analog pain score.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the postoperative activity level after LESS TEP and conventional multiport TEP&#xD;
           hernia repair with modified Medical Outcome Study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the clinical results and complication rates after LESS TEP and conventional&#xD;
           multiport TEP hernia repair by clinic follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the longterm functional outcomes 6 months after LESS TEP and conventional&#xD;
           multiport TEP hernia repair with follow up questionnaire.&#xD;
