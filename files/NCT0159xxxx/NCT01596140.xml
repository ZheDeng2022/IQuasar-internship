  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of vemurafenib&#xD;
      that can be given in combination with either everolimus or temsirolimus. The safety of these&#xD;
      drug combinations will also be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vemurafenib is designed to block BRAF inside the cancer cells, which is a mutation that is&#xD;
      involved in cancer cell growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Temsirolimus and everolimus are designed to block the growth of cancer cells, which may cause&#xD;
      cancer cells to die.&#xD;

      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, your doctor will decide whether&#xD;
      you will receive either everolimus or temsirolimus&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be assigned to a dose level of vemurafenib based on when you join this study. Up to&#xD;
      5 dose levels of vemurafenib will be tested. Up to 6 participants will be enrolled at each&#xD;
      dose level. The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level. Each new&#xD;
      group will receive a higher dose than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects&#xD;
      were seen. This will continue until the highest tolerable dose of vemurafenib is found.&#xD;
&#xD;

           hospitalizations that you may have.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Keep the study drug in a safe place, for your use only, and away from children. It must&#xD;
           be stored at room temperature but not warmer than 77 degrees F (25 degrees Celsius).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete your diaries as instructed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  While on this study, you cannot take part in any other research project without approval&#xD;

&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Vemurafenib is FDA-approved for metastatic melanoma. Its&#xD;
      use in other types of cancer is investigational. Everolimus and temsirolimus are FDA approved&#xD;
      kidney cancer. The combination of these drugs is investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 114 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.&#xD;

    <description>The MTD of combination Vemurafenib and Everolimus or Vemurafenib and Temsirolimus is defined as the highest dose studied in which the incidence of dose limiting toxicity (DLT) was less than one third (33%) of the participants at that dose level. DLT defined as any Grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic toxicity, as defined in NCI CTC v4.0, even if expected and believed related to study medications, any Grade 4 hematologic toxicity lasting two weeks or longer despite supportive care; Grade 3 nausea/vomiting &gt; 48 hours or any Grade 4 nausea/vomiting; and any other Grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity, including symptoms/signs of vascular leak or cytokine release syndrome; or any severe or life-threatening complication or abnormality not defined in NCI-CTCAE that is attributable to therapy.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tumor Response</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Tumor response defined as one or more of the following: (1) stable disease for more than or equal to 4 months, (2) decrease in measurable tumor (sentinel lesions) by more than or equal to 20% by RECIST criteria, (3) decrease in tumor markers by more than or equal to 25% (for example, a &gt;/= 25% decrease in CA125 for patients with ovarian cancer), or (4) a partial response according to Choi criteria, i.e., decrease in size by 10% or more, or a decrease in tumor density, as measured in Hounsfield units (HU), by more than or equal to 15%.</description>
