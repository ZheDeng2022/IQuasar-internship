  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies have shown that people with multiple sclerosis (MS) who also have diseases&#xD;
      related to vascular health such as high cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes,&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease, and others, may end up more disabled than people with MS who don't&#xD;
      have those diseases. This has led to a growing interest in the role of vascular diseases in&#xD;
      MS since they may provide another avenue of MS treatment. Some also think that vascular&#xD;
      disease may even be a cause of MS. The back of the eye, the retina, is well-suited to&#xD;
      studying vascular diseases as blood vessels can be seen even on routine examination of the&#xD;
      eye by eye doctors. These specialists are used to seeing changes in retinal blood vessels due&#xD;
      to diseases known to affect the eyes such as glaucoma and diabetes. Sophisticated techniques&#xD;
      for examining the retina allow for not only visualization of blood vessels, but the rate of&#xD;
      blood flow through the blood vessels as well. These blood flow changes are thought to come&#xD;
      before changes in what the blood vessels look like, and so may be able to detect problems&#xD;
      even earlier than routine examination of the retina by eye doctors. Retinal blood flow has&#xD;
      never been carefully studied in MS. Given that MS affects the retina due to the late effects&#xD;
      of inflammation of the optic nerve, or optic neuritis, the investigators expect to see&#xD;
      altered blood flow in the retinal blood vessels of people with MS compared to healthy control&#xD;
      subjects. If so, the investigators can then use retinal blood flow as a way to measure&#xD;
      therapies that target vascular diseases in the MS population and determine if those therapies&#xD;
      can alter the course of disease.&#xD;

      Background data including age, sex, medical history, and neurologic history and status will&#xD;
      be gathered prior to the study/OCT testing visit. At the single study/testing visit, subjects&#xD;
      will have their blood pressure and intraocular pressure checked (using numbing drops that&#xD;
      last 15-20 minutes), undergo vision testing and then have their eyes dilated with standard&#xD;
      dilating drops. They will then undergo optical coherence tomography testing to determine the&#xD;
      blood flow of the retinal blood vessels and to take other measurements of the back of the eye&#xD;
      including thicknesses of the nervous tissue elements of the retina.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OCT Procedure: The subject will be seated and have their head positioned on a chin rest. They&#xD;
      will be asked to look at a target (a lighted spot) while a beam of light scans the front part&#xD;
      of the eye. The light is infrared and will not be visible or cause any sensation. A cotton&#xD;
      tip swab may be used to help hold the eyelid open temporarily if necessary.&#xD;

        The study will enroll both males and females and include all ethnic and racial groups&#xD;
        through clinical practices. The study will enroll subjects from 18 to 70 years of age.&#xD;
        Participants older than 70 years are excluded as cooperation with tests may be difficult.&#xD;
        For similar reasons, participants who have MS and vision worse than 20/200 are excluded.&#xD;
        The study also excludes those with any eye disease that would interfere with of assessment&#xD;
        of MS. Otherwise people with any health status are eligible for enrollment. Two groups of&#xD;
        participants are recruited: people with healthy, normal eyes and people with any type of&#xD;
        MS.&#xD;
