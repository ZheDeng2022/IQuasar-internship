  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The efficacy of psychosocial treatments for PG, including cognitive-behaviour therapy (CBT)&#xD;
      and motivational interviewing (MI) approaches, has been supported in a handful of clinical&#xD;
      trials. Indeed, there is more evidence supporting these two approaches than for any other&#xD;
      psychosocial treatment for problem gambling. However, while efficacy studies have been&#xD;
      conducted, few studies have examined the effectiveness of behavioural treatment in&#xD;
      community-based gambling treatment settings. That is to say, the investigators have a good&#xD;
      idea of what works in a laboratory setting (i.e., university research settings), but the&#xD;
      investigators have no research assessing the transfer of evidence-based treatments for&#xD;
      problem gambling to community care. Efficacy studies provide substantially less information&#xD;
      about the actual utility of treatments than do effectiveness trials because the way in which&#xD;
      treatment is actually provided in the field (with flexibility in terms of time-frame and&#xD;
      technique and the tendency to address co-occurring problems) is different from the much more&#xD;
      single-focused (on gambling) way it is conducted in laboratory settings. The proposed study&#xD;
      is designed to address this significant gap in the research literature. The investigators&#xD;
      propose to conduct a treatment effectiveness trial examining a combined cognitive&#xD;
      motivational behavior therapy (CMBT) delivered by community-based problem gambling treatment&#xD;
      providers, compared with treatment as usual (TAU).&#xD;

      Pilot Study: Eligible participants will undergo a full consent process and a brief interview&#xD;
      to assess demographics. Participants' counselors will be asked to audio-record up to 3&#xD;
      therapy sessions which will subsequently be rated for adherence to CMBT procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Study: Eligible participants will undergo a full consent process followed by an in-depth&#xD;
      interview, with a research assistant. Following an intake assessment, participants will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to one of the three intervention groups. Randomization also will be&#xD;
      balanced based on gender to ensure an equitable distribution of men and women in each&#xD;
      condition. The research assistant will give the treatment referrals and will introduce the&#xD;
      participant to his/her therapist as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will be provided by clinicians at the Windsor Regional Problem Gambling Services.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment as usual (TAU) - Therapists will be instructed to conduct therapy as they&#xD;
           normally would with PGs entering treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cognitive motivational behaviour therapy (CMBT) Therapy will consist of 12 60-minute&#xD;
           individual counselling sessions. The cognitive-behavioural portion of the intervention&#xD;
           is targeted at addressing gambling-related cognitive distortions (e.g., the idea that&#xD;
           the gambler can control random events). Motivational interviewing techniques are&#xD;
           included to address participant ambivalence about his/her gambling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 8 therapists will provide treatment (4 CMBT and 4 TAU, randomly assigned using&#xD;
      flip of a coin.) The therapists enrolled in CMBT will be trained for the study. TAU&#xD;
      therapists will be offered training in CMBT once study recruitment goals have been met (thus,&#xD;
      eventually all therapists will receive training in CMBT). Prior to providing treatment,&#xD;
      therapists selected to administer CMBT will receive intensive training in administration of&#xD;
      this approach. The therapists will be selected from the professional staff of the Windsor&#xD;
      Regional Hospital's Problem Gambling Services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Waitlist control condition (WLC) - WLC participants will wait 12-weeks to begin treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At that point, participants will be randomly assigned to receive TAU or CMBT and will proceed&#xD;
      through the same study phase (i.e., treatment and follow-up).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo assessments at intake, post-treatment, 6- and 12-months.&#xD;
