  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      LAI115428 is a Phase I, randomized, repeat dose escalation study to determine the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, and PK profile of intramuscular and subcutaneous injections of GSK1265744 in a&#xD;
      long acting parenteral (LAP) formulation in healthy subjects. Subjects will be randomized to&#xD;
      3 monthly dosing cohorts and 1 quarterly dosing cohort with either intramuscular or&#xD;
      subcutaneous dosing. In the monthly dosing cohorts subjects will receive GSK1265744 alone for&#xD;
      2 months and then in combination with TMC278 long acting parenteral (LA) for 2 months. For&#xD;
      the quarterly dosing cohort, 2 quarterly intramuscular doses of GSK1265744 LAP will be given&#xD;
      alone. Three dose levels of GSK1265744 will be evaluated partly in combination with TMC278 LA&#xD;
      to adequately characterize the GSK1265744 LAP and TMC278 LA safety, tolerability, and PK&#xD;
      profile. A total enrolment of approximately 40 healthy subjects is planned for this study.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin greater than or equal to 1.5xULN&#xD;

             evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and&#xD;
             cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinically significant abnormality or laboratory&#xD;
             parameters outside the reference range for the population being studied may be&#xD;
             included only if the Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the finding&#xD;
             is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study&#xD;
             procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female between 18 and 64 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the&#xD;

             screen and at Day -21, and agrees to use one of the contraception methods listed in&#xD;
             the protocol for an appropriate period of time (as determined by the product label or&#xD;
             investigator) prior to the start of dosing to sufficiently minimize the risk of&#xD;
             pregnancy at that point. Female subjects must agree to use contraception for six&#xD;
             months after the final dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body weight greater than or equal to 50 kg for men and greater than or equal to 45 kg&#xD;
             for women and body mass index (BMI) within the range 18.5-31.0 kg/m2 (inclusive).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All Study subjects should be counseled on the practice of safer sexual practices&#xD;
             including the use of effective barrier methods (e.g. male condom/spermicide).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of bleeding or clotting disorders including disseminated intravascular&#xD;
             coagulation, hemophilia Henoch-SchÃ¶nlein purpura (allergic purpura), hereditary&#xD;

             drugs, acquired a sexually transmitted disease, high risk partner currently or in the&#xD;
             previous six months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A positive pre-study Hepatitis B surface antigen or positive Hepatitis C antibody&#xD;
             result within 3 months of screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities&#xD;
             (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones).&#xD;

             investigational product (whichever is longer).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first&#xD;
             dosing day.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Refrain from use of prescription or non-prescription drugs, herbal and dietary&#xD;
             supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days (or 14 days if the drug is a&#xD;
             potential enzyme inducer) or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first&#xD;
             dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and GSK Medical&#xD;

             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK&#xD;

             sampling, subjects with a history or sensitivity to heparin or heparin-induced&#xD;
             thrombocytopenia should not be enrolled.&#xD;

             dermatitis, eczema, drug rash, drug allergy, psoriasis, food allergy, urticaria. Mild&#xD;
             cases of localized acne or folliculitis are not exclusionary.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has a tattoo or other dermatological condition overlying the gluteus&#xD;
