  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic, and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic effects of Aes-103 (active ingredient 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furfural [5-HMF])&#xD;
      compared with placebo in subjects with stable sickle cell disease (SCD). Safety will be&#xD;
      measured by monitoring adverse events (AEs), electrocardiograms (ECGs), vital signs, and&#xD;
      laboratory values. Pharmacokinetics of Aes-103 will be measured over time in plasma, red&#xD;
      blood cell hemolysate and binding of Aes-103 to hemoglobin. Pharmacodynamic effects will be&#xD;
      assessed by measuring partial pressure of oxygen at which 50% of hemoglobin is saturated with&#xD;
      oxygen (p50) while breathing normal air, blood oxygen levels (SpO2), ex-vivo antisickling&#xD;
      effects in a hypoxic environment, and by imaging related changes in tissue blood flow and&#xD;
      oxygen levels.&#xD;

    <description>Group A will consist of six subjects receiving a single dose of either a low dose of Aes-103 (300 mg) or placebo without food. After a minimum of a 1- to 2-week washout period and evaluation of blinded safety data, subjects initially randomized to Aes-103 will receive a second, higher dose of Aes-103 (1,000 mg), and subjects initially randomized to placebo will receive a second dose of placebo without food.</description>

    <description>Group B will consist of six subjects receiving an initial dose of either Aes 103 (2,000 mg) or placebo without food. After a minimum of a 1- to 2-week washout period and evaluation of blinded safety data, subjects initially randomized to Aes-103 will receive a second, higher dose of Aes-103 (4,000 mg), and subjects initially randomized to placebo will receive a second dose of placebo without food.</description>

    <description>Once the top dose (i.e., highest tolerated) of Aes-103 has been determined, the size of this group will be expanded with an additional six subjects (Group C) for a total of 12 at that dose, distributed so that six subjects receiving hydroxyurea (HU) and six subjects not receiving HU (for the past 6 months) will receive study drug (five receiving Aes-103 and one receiving placebo in each of the HU and non-HU treated cohorts). This total of 12 subjects includes the initial six subjects who received the highest dose in the study plus six Group C subjects. These subjects will receive a single dose of the top dose of Aes-103 or placebo without food. After a minimum of a 1- to 2-week washout period and evaluation of blinded safety data, subjects initially randomized to Aes-103 will receive a second dose of the top dose of Aes-103 and subjects initially randomized to placebo will receive a second dose of placebo; all subjects will be administered a pre-dose, high fat, high protein meal.</description>
