      Brief Summary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to measure the independent and combined effects of interventions&#xD;
      that improve water quality, sanitation, hand washing, and nutrition on child growth and&#xD;
      development in the first years of life.&#xD;
    </textblock>

      Detailed Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infection and inadequate diet are proximate risk factors for under-nutrition and early life&#xD;
      growth faltering; the two processes likely act reciprocally in a vicious cycle that&#xD;
      perpetuates physiologic and metabolic deficits and increases the risk of mortality. Children&#xD;
      who exhibit growth faltering are more likely to have deficits in cognitive development and&#xD;
      long-term human capital, and are more likely to have children who also suffer from growth&#xD;
      deficits - perpetuating the cycle into the next generation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two probable interdependent pathways that link enteric infections to child growth&#xD;
      and development. The first pathway includes repeated infections the lead to acute illness or&#xD;
      parasitic infection in the first years of life, which increase the risk of stunting and&#xD;
      subsequent cognitive deficits in childhood and later in life. The second pathway is through a&#xD;
      subclinical condition called environmental enteropathy (EE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is limited evidence to demonstrate whether or not water quality, sanitation, and hand&#xD;
      washing (WASH) interventions can improve measures of EE, child growth and development, and&#xD;
      whether nutritional interventions could be enhanced if provided concurrently with WASH&#xD;
      interventions. To help fill this evidence gap, the WASH Benefits study will deliver&#xD;
      randomized interventions designed to reduce infection and improve nutrition, and will measure&#xD;
      intervention effects on child illness, growth and development. WASH Benefits includes two,&#xD;
      comparable but standalone trials in Bangladesh and Kenya that are registered under separate&#xD;
      protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Bangladesh, the study will include 720 clusters, and each cluster will enroll 8 household&#xD;
      compounds (baris) with pregnant women in their second or third trimester. The study will&#xD;
      randomize 90 clusters to each of 6 active intervention arms (water quality, sanitation, hand&#xD;
      washing, combined WSH, nutrition, nutrition+WSH), and 180 clusters to a standard practices&#xD;
      non-intervention arm. Children born into the cohort will be followed for 2 years after the&#xD;
      intervention, with measurements at 12 and 24 months after intervention delivery. (anticipated&#xD;
      age range: 20 - 27 months old at the final measurement). At the 12- and 24-month follow-up&#xD;
      visits, the study will collect child anthropometric measurements and caregiver-reported&#xD;
      diarrhea. In the final visit the study will administer a test to measure child development&#xD;
      outcomes. The study will collect urine, blood, and stool specimens from a subsample of 1,500&#xD;
      children distributed across four arms of the study (Control, combined WSH, Nutrition,&#xD;
      Nutrition+WSH) to measure biomarkers of gut function and intestinal parasitic infections at&#xD;
      the 12- and 24-month follow-up visits. In addition, the study will collect specimens (blood,&#xD;
      stool) from children 18 - 27 months old at baseline who are living in the same compound as&#xD;
      target children to test for intestinal parasitic infections. At 24-months in all arms, the&#xD;
      study will collect specimens stool from target children, children 18 - 27 months old at&#xD;
      baseline, a school-aged child, and an adult who are living in the same compound as target&#xD;
      children to test for intestinal parasitic infections. At 36-months in all arms, the study&#xD;
      will collect specimens stool from target children, a school-aged child, and an adult who are&#xD;
      living in the same compound as target children to test for intestinal parasitic infections.&#xD;
