  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Green tea contains catechins and theanine as major ingredients and has been reported to have&#xD;
      various beneficial influences on human health. It is reported that the drinking green tea is&#xD;
      inversely associated with serum homocysteine level in elderly. However the effect of green&#xD;
      tea consumption on cognitive dysfunction is not clinically clarified. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to investigate the effects of green tea consumption on homocysteine metabolism and&#xD;
      cognitive dysfunction in elderly with impaired cognitive function.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Elderly people with impaired cognitive function go on increasing year by year with the coming&#xD;
      aged society. Among them, the Alzheimer disease is a major cause of the illness, which is&#xD;
      progressively worse, has no fundamental curable therapy, and induces the burdens of&#xD;
      caregivers as well as the health insurance and national budget. Recently, homocysteine&#xD;
      metabolism is reported to be related to atherosclerosis in aging, and draw attention as the&#xD;
      etiology of cognitive dysfunction in elderly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Green tea contains catechins and theanine as main ingredients. These components are reported&#xD;
      to have anti-atherogenic action and effect on improving cognitive dysfunction. However,&#xD;
      clinical evidence for homocysteine metabolism and cognitive dysfunction has not been&#xD;
      clarified. Therefore, in this study, the investigators attempted to investigate the effects&#xD;
      of green tea consumption on homocysteine metabolism and cognitive dysfunction in elderly with&#xD;
      impaired cognitive function.&#xD;
