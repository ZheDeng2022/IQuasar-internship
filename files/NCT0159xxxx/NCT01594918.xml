  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of cabazitaxel, mitoxantrone, and prednisone&#xD;
      (CAMP) in combination at different dose levels and to determine the highest dose that does&#xD;
      not cause bad side effects. The investigators want to find out what effects, good and/or bad,&#xD;
      CAMP has on patients and their metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open label, dose-finding, multicenter clinical trial to establish the&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicities (DLT) of cabazitaxel (25 mg/m2 IV&#xD;
      q21 days) in combination with mitoxantrone (4-12 mg/m2 IV q21 days) and prednisone (5mg&#xD;
      orally BID) in patients with metastatic CRPC who have not undergone prior chemotherapy for&#xD;
      metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to five cohorts will be enrolled to determine the MTD and DLT profile of this combination.&#xD;
      An accelerated titration design method is being used in order to minimize the number of&#xD;
      patients exposed to subtherapeutic doses of mitoxantrone.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Progressive metastatic prostate cancer (positive bone scan or measurable disease)&#xD;
        despite castrate levels of testosterone (either from orchiectomy or LHRH agonist therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients may have either non-measurable disease OR measurable disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. All patients must have a PSA ≥ 2 ng/mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Progressive disease based on any one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. transaxial imaging&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. a rise in PSA&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. radionuclide bone scan&#xD;
&#xD;
             Patients whose sole manifestation of progression is an increase in disease-related&#xD;
             symptoms are not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. For patients with measurable disease, progression will be defined by the RECIST&#xD;
                  criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. For patients with non-measurable disease, a positive bone scan and elevated PSA&#xD;
                  will be required. PSA evidence for progressive prostate cancer during or after&#xD;
                  first-line chemotherapy consists of a PSA level of at least 2 ng/ml which has&#xD;
                  risen on at least 2 successive occasions, at least one week apart. If the&#xD;
                  confirmatory PSA (#3) value is less (i.e., #3b) than the screening PSA (#2)&#xD;
                  value, then an additional test for rising PSA (#4) will be required to document&#xD;
                  progression for the purposes of eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Radionuclide bone scan: new metastatic lesions&#xD;
&#xD;
                  6. Testosterone &lt; 50 ng/dL. Patients must continue primary androgen deprivation&#xD;
                  with an LHRH analogue if they have not undergone orchiectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  7. ECOG Performance Status 0 -2.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  8. Required Laboratory values:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Creatinine &lt; 1.5 x upper limits of normal (ULN). If Cr. &gt; 1.5 x ULN, then&#xD;
                  calculated creatinine clearance &gt; 40cc/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. ALT and AST within normal limits&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 2,000/mm3&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Platelets &gt; 100,000/ mm3&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Hemoglobin &gt; 8.0 gm/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. Total bilirubin within normal limits&#xD;
&#xD;
                  9. Ejection fraction by MUGA scan or echocardiogram ≥ lower limit of&#xD;
                  institutional normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  10. Patients receiving hormonal therapy (i.e. any dose of megestrol acetate&#xD;
                  (Megace), Proscar (finasteride), any herbal product known to decrease PSA levels&#xD;
                  (e.g., Saw Palmetto and PC-SPES) other than LHRH agonist/antagonist or a stable&#xD;
                  dose of corticosteroid from a prior chemotherapy regimen must discontinue the&#xD;
                  agent for at least 4 weeks prior to enrollment. Progressive disease must be&#xD;
                  documented after discontinuation of the hormonal therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  11. No other systemic therapies for prostate cancer within 28 days prior to&#xD;
                  initiation of this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  12. Prior radiation therapy completed ≥ 4 weeks prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  13. No history of radiopharmaceuticals (strontium, samarium) for prostate cancer&#xD;
                  treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  14. Patients must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method&#xD;
                  of birth control) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation&#xD;
                  and for 3 months after discontinuing therapy. Should a patient's sexual partner&#xD;
                  become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while the patient is participating in&#xD;
                  this study, he should inform the treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  15. Life expectancy &gt; 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  16. Age ≥ 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
                  17. Inclusion of Minorities: Men and members of all ethnic groups are eligible&#xD;
                  for this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    1. Patients with significant cardiovascular disease including congestive heart&#xD;
                       failure (NYHA class III or IV), active angina pectoris or myocardial&#xD;

&#xD;
                    2. Patients with serious intercurrent infections, or nonmalignant medical&#xD;
                       illnesses that are uncontrolled or whose control may be jeopardized by the&#xD;
                       complications of this therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    3. Patients with psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit&#xD;
                       compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    4. Patients with pre-existing neuropathy greater than CTCAE Grade 1 (motor or&#xD;
                       sensory).&#xD;
&#xD;
                    5. Patients with known prior severe hypersensitivity reactions to cabazitaxel&#xD;
                       or other agents containing polysorbate 80.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    6. Patients with known active brain metastases are excluded because of their&#xD;
                       poor prognosis. Head CT is NOT routinely required prior to enrollment.&#xD;
                       Patients with treated, asymptomatic brain metastasis will be eligible for&#xD;
                       enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    7. Patients with a &quot;currently active&quot; second malignancy other than non-melanoma&#xD;
                       skin cancer are excluded. [Patients are not considered to have a &quot;currently&#xD;
                       active&quot; malignancy if they have completed therapy and are considered by&#xD;
                       their physician to be at less than 30% risk of relapse.]&#xD;
&#xD;
                    8. Concurrent use of moderate to strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is not allowed.&#xD;
