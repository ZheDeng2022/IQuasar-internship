  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study compares patient satisfaction in terms of pain relief, mobility and ease of use&#xD;
      between 3 commonly used types of post-surgical footwear. This study randomises patients who&#xD;
      participate into one of 3 groups of footwear, namely Darco, Podalux or standard dressing&#xD;
      shoe. Number of patients enrolled is determined by power calculation. Patients complete a&#xD;
      single, simple previously validated questionnaire the MOXFQ (Manchester-Oxford Foot&#xD;
      Questionnaire) at their 6 week follow-up appointment and statistical differences between the&#xD;
      group are calculated using a significance level of p&lt;0.05. This study will help us determine&#xD;
      the best foot-wear to offer the investigators post-surgical patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will form original research.&#xD;

      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a randomised trial with three arms: 1. Darco, 2. Podalux, 3. Standard dressing&#xD;
      shoe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomised controlled trial will ensure that shoes are distributed without surgeon bias,&#xD;
      and will be performed prior to surgery by the principle investigator. Baseline differences&#xD;
      will be assessed for by administration of a pre-operative MOXFQ score prior to randomisation.&#xD;
      Primary outcome measure will be difference in score between groups post-operatively, however&#xD;
      we will also analyse the absolute change in score between groups, although this we do not&#xD;
      feel can be the primary outcome measure as the major reason for the change in MOXFQ from pre&#xD;
      to post operation will be the surgery itself.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding and randomisation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation will be achieved by a computer generated randomisation table. As two main types&#xD;
      of surgery will be used in the study as outlined below (namely 1st metatarsal osteotomy and&#xD;
      1st MTP joint fusion), we will have two separate randomisation groups to ensure that numbers&#xD;
      of each operation are evenly distributed between the three types of shoe. This will improve&#xD;
      heterogeneity of the groups. We have decided to use two types of surgery as the research&#xD;
      question is relevant to both and we can perform a secondary analysis to look between these&#xD;
      groups more closely as detailed below. For practical purposes this will not be a blinded&#xD;
      trial as the surgeon and patient will both be aware of the shoe provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have sought an opinion from a statistician. The data for the MOXFQ (primary outcome&#xD;
      measure) will be subdivided into the 3 domains, walking/standing, pain and social demain, and&#xD;
      the raw scores will be treated as laid out in the original paper by Dawson et al. (2011) [2].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scores from each of the 3 domains is then converted to a metric 0-100 scale for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Surgical Show Questionnaire scores (secondary outcome measure) will be totalled to give a&#xD;
      score out of 50.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be analysed for normality, and comparison will be made using the ANOVA or&#xD;
      Kruskall-Wallis testing for unpaired continuous data as advised by the statistician, with a&#xD;
      significance level set at P&lt;0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have been advised that we can perform a secondary analysis using linear regression to look&#xD;
      at the effect of the differences within the groups on outcome, for example differences&#xD;
      between operation type and each of the shoes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statsdirect statistical software will be used. There is a question (Q1) in the Surgical Shoe&#xD;
      Questionnaire that asks the patient how long they wore the shoe for. This question is not&#xD;
      included in the scoring and is included to assess for patient use, and will be used as a&#xD;
      secondary outcome measure. The study does not necessarily require strict patient compliance&#xD;
      as discontinuation of the shoe is valuable information in its own right. This can be looked&#xD;
      at within the secondary analysis using linear regression as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary analysis will be intention to treat analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MOXFQ is a widely validated foot score used in the assessment of the foot with 3&#xD;
      specified domains; walking/standing, pain, and social interaction (Appendix 1). The MOXFQ&#xD;
      (Manchester-Oxford foot Questionnaire) walking/standing domain will be used as the primary&#xD;
      outcome measure as this includes the questions that are most relevant to ease of shoe use.&#xD;
      However the other 2 domains will be analyses although there is more likely to be confounding&#xD;
      factors that will affect these. Secondary outcome measures will include 11 questions related&#xD;
      to the wearing of the shoe forming a separate questionnaire. (Appendix 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The setting for the study will be clinical. Out-patients clinic for recruitment and follow-up&#xD;
      and theatre for randomisation and post-surgical shoe provision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited from outpatient clinics directly by the clinical care team, and&#xD;
      will be recruited from those who have been listed for forefoot surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergoing forefoot surgery who meet the inclusion criteria will be invited to&#xD;
      participate in the trial and provided with written information within the clinic setting [see&#xD;
      Patient Information Sheet ver 1.0]. Those wishing to participate will be asked to provide&#xD;
      written consent on the day of surgery [see Patient Consent Form ver 1.0] which will be&#xD;
      undertaken by the principle investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion and exclusion criteria have been chosen that include the majority of patients&#xD;
      undergoing straightforward forefoot surgery who would be normally managed in our current&#xD;
      post-operative shoe (the Darco), and who have capacity to consent to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients over 18 years age Patients normally independently mobile Patients with no&#xD;
      significant co-morbidities that would be expected to affect normal ambulation Patients&#xD;
      undergoing straightforward 1st ray surgery eg. 1st MTPJ arthrodesis, 1st metatarsal&#xD;
      osteotomy, (in combination with 2nd ray procedures allowed) Patients able to understand and&#xD;
      complete questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients under 18 years age Patients not independently mobile Patients with significant&#xD;
      co-morbidities that effect normal ambulation (eg hip arthritis) Patients undergoing&#xD;
      complicated forefoot reconstructive surgery or surgery on rays other then 1st and 2nd.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients unable to understand or complete self-administered questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size will be determined based on a power calculation using MOXFQ (Manchester-Oxford&#xD;
      foot Questionnaire) as the primary outcome measure. The MOXFQ is a widely validated foot&#xD;
      score used in the assessment of the foot with 3 specified domains; walking/standing, pain,&#xD;
      and social interaction (Appendix 1). It is the walking/standing domain that has provided us&#xD;
      with the data for the power calculation (1,2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The walking/standing domain scores out of 35 which is then transformed to a score out of 100,&#xD;
      an approximate multiple of 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have calculated the standardised difference as 15 out of 100, which equates to a raw score&#xD;
      of 30 out of 35, or a one point drop for 5 out of 7 questions, which is the minimum&#xD;
      difference we wish to detect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a significance level of 0.05 and power level of 0.8 we calculate each arm of the trial&#xD;
      will consist of 29 patients (standardised difference between means =15, standard deviation&#xD;
      =20). This has been agreed with the statistician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In total 90 patients will be required. We estimate approximately 6 to 8 of these procedures&#xD;
      are carried out with the Foot and ankle unit per week, and therefore estimate the study will&#xD;
      take around 12 to 16 weeks to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject with-drawl:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects are free to with-draw at any time during the study, and will be included in the&#xD;
      intention to treat analysis by being assigned a questionnaire score identical to that of the&#xD;
      lowest scoring participant in their randomisation group. For example if the Darco group score&#xD;
      from 65 to 95 of the MOXFQ, a subject who withdraws will be assigned a value of 65. Due to&#xD;
      the short nature of the study we anticipate this will be infrequent. Those patients who&#xD;
      change their surgical footwear will be included in the intention to treat analysis for their&#xD;
      original randomised group as agreed with the statistician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once patients have consented and completed the pre-operative MOXFQ score, following their&#xD;
      surgery, patients will be randomly assigned to one of the three treatment arms to wear the&#xD;
      shoe for 6 weeks following their surgery. The participant will be advised that withdrawal&#xD;
      from the study at any stage is possible and only data collected up until that point will be&#xD;
      used, although due to the timeframe and nature of the study we believe this is unlikely to&#xD;
      occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will attend for their routine follow-up at 2 weeks post-surgery for wound review and&#xD;
      removal of any sutures used in our nurse-led dressing clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will attend for their routine 6 week post-surgery follow-up appointment with their&#xD;
      consultant and will be asked to complete the questionnaire assessment. This will mark the end&#xD;
      of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whilst we do not anticipate any adverse events, any problems with the shoes will be monitored&#xD;
      during the clinic visits and documented for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality control:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be overseen by the principle investigator. All questionnaires will be looked&#xD;
      at as soon as they are completed in clinic, to ensure completeness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project management The study is straightforward, with minimum man-power requirements, and&#xD;
      will therefore be conducted by the principle and co-investigators. Progress will be monitored&#xD;
      at the regular meetings of the foot and ankle research group held every 2 months. Data will&#xD;
      be held within the secured office of the foot and ankle fellow, and be stored anonymously&#xD;
      using a participant number assigned on consent. The master patient log with the participants&#xD;
      details will be held as a paper copy within the foot and ankle office.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expertise As this study only involves the administration of a simple questionnaire, no&#xD;
      specialist involvement is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Issues The patient information leaflet is provided to patients when they are listed&#xD;
      for surgery in clinic to allow them time to consider participating in the trial. Patients&#xD;
      happy to participate in the trial are consented on the day of surgery by the lead or&#xD;
      co-investigators. Patients are allocated a particpant number held on a master log in a locked&#xD;
      office, and throughout the trial questionnaires use this number to maintain confidentiality&#xD;
      as per Caldicott guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Costing Schedule No additional costs will be incurred. The Darco and standard dressing shoes&#xD;
      are already in use in the hospital, and the Podalux shoes have been provided on a free trial&#xD;
      basis by Donjoy Int. Basic costs such as photocopying questionnaires will be provided by the&#xD;
      foot and ankle research unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Funding arrangements The only additional funding we anticipate is with the provision of&#xD;
      questionnaires and is estimated at around £36.00 (based on the price of photocopying 5p per&#xD;
      sheet). This includes 90 consent forms (1 page), 90 (4 pages), 180 MOXFQ's (1 page), 90&#xD;
      Surgical shoe questionnaires (1page).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We anticipate the role of the research nurse to be negligible as all the questionnaires and&#xD;
      paperwork will be administed in the out-patients clinics or prior to surgery by clinicians.&#xD;
