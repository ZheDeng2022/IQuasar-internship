  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The improvement of the healing rates for breast cancer is based to an important part on the&#xD;
      consistent use of so-called adjuvant (&quot;supporting &quot;) medicamentous therapies, including&#xD;
      chemotherapy. However this success has a price due to still inaccurate knowledge of the&#xD;
      individual risk of relapse: a high number of unnecessary therapies are applied&#xD;
      (over-therapy!). The invasion factors uPA (plasminogen activator of the urokinase type) and&#xD;
      PAI-1 (uPA inhibitor) were described extensively as strong and independent prognosis factors&#xD;
      with high clinical relevance for patients with node negative breast cancer. Compared to&#xD;
      clinical and pathological factors (further: &quot;traditional factors &quot;) they show better&#xD;
      estimation of the relapse risk leading to an avoidance of redundant adjuvant chemotherapy and&#xD;
      may thus essentially contribute to the improvement of the quality of life in these women. In&#xD;
      this study we aim to evaluate, how large the portion of the patients with early, operable,&#xD;
      node negative breast cancer will be, in whom, by improved low-risk identification through&#xD;
      uPA/PAI-1, adjuvant chemotherapy can be omitted.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The determination of the prognostic factors uPA/PAI-1 (further: &quot;biological&quot;) is established&#xD;
      and recommend by recent guidelines. However, so far data can only show their independent and&#xD;
      strong prognostic influence. The absolute proportion of patients, which profit from the&#xD;
      improved risk assessment, is only estimated from old trials with different patient&#xD;
      populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depending upon assessment, the proportion of low risk patients by traditional risk assessment&#xD;
      is 20 - 40%, by biological assessment 35 - 55% of all node negative patients. The data from&#xD;
      investigations of historic populations are not reproducible now because of smaller tumor size&#xD;
      at presentation due to diagnostic procedures (Screening, good public promotion).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effectiveness and clinical relevance of the risk assessment were already confirmed for&#xD;
      the biological prognostic factors uPA/PAI-1 in node negative breast cancer in several&#xD;
      retrospective and prospective trials as well as in a meta-analysis. Still these biological&#xD;
      factors (or others!) are not yet established into nationwide clinical routine in Germany.&#xD;
      This is due to higher expenditure of this method for the primary therapy (uPA/PAI-1 is&#xD;
      determined in the shock-frozen tissue), on the other hand due to the absence of&#xD;
      reimbursement. Therefore presently in many centres risk estimation and associated therapy&#xD;
      decision is done by traditional assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to justify the higher expenditure and the additional costs by the&#xD;
      uPA/PAI-1-determination, not only the clear proof of the advantage for the individual&#xD;
      patient, but also the estimation of the extent of this advantage in all applicable patients&#xD;
      is necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A first goal of this project is to compare the respective proportion of patients allocated as&#xD;
      high- or low-risk by means of biological and also traditional prognosis factors in a defined&#xD;
      consecutive patient cohort. The determination of uPA/PAI-1 should be established as standard&#xD;
      procedure in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So far, the question discussed above referred mainly to patients with node negative breast&#xD;
      cancer. In this group, the largest effect in saving chemotherapy is to be expected. Due to&#xD;
      previous results we assume that also in node positive patients adjuvant chemotherapy may be&#xD;
      saved in sub-group because of very small risk of recurrence. Therefore the determination of&#xD;
      uPA/PAI-1 for this group of patients will also be done at the end of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second goal of this project is it to collect data for risk assessment in node positive&#xD;
      patients to be able to offer assistance in the future to perhaps give a better estimation of&#xD;
      the individual risk of recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Practically fresh frozen tissue will be taken, shock-frozen and stored from all consecutive&#xD;
      patients operated in the five participating hospitals. The determination of uPA/PAI-1 will be&#xD;
      performed in the research laboratory of department of Gynaecology at the University Hospital&#xD;
      in Halle (Saale).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A third goal is it to provide biological risk assessment by giving results of uPA/PAI-1&#xD;
      testing promptly to participating node negative patients. This information will be crucial in&#xD;
      their decision for or against chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amendment 2 from June 12, 2012 (Steering committee E Kantelhardt, M Vetter, Ch Thomssen)&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) Established prognostic factors (RNA level) will be evaluated in the context of uPA/PAI-1&#xD;
      and immunohistochemistry markers on samples from the frozen and FFPE tissue. The list of&#xD;
      genes is submitted to the Ethics sommittee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B) Eplorative analysis of these factors concerning response to therapy will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C) Follow-up information will be collected after a minimum observation time of 2.5 years for&#xD;
      all patients (in October 2013).&#xD;
