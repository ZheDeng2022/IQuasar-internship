      Purpose is to determine the effect of ephedrine and caffeine, on metabolic rate and weight&#xD;
      loss after bariatric surgery. Approximately 40% of patients struggle with their weight loss&#xD;
      rate, or metabolic rate, after bariatric surgery, and at least 30% previously had or develop&#xD;
      a low metabolic rate after surgery. Metabolic rate is the speed at which calories are burned.&#xD;
      The fewer the calories eaten and the more calories burned, the more rapidly weight is lost.&#xD;
      It is possible that despite a very low calorie intake following bariatric surgery metabolic&#xD;
      rate will decrease so much so that weight does not decrease even if intake is reduced to 1000&#xD;
      calories per day. Ephedrine is a medicine used commonly to treat asthma, difficulty&#xD;
      breathing, and wheezing. However, 40 years ago it was reported in scientific studies that&#xD;
      ephedrine increases weight loss in patients on low calorie diets by increase the amount of&#xD;
      calories that are burned. Combining caffeine with ephedrine makes ephedrine work more&#xD;
      efficiently (more weight loss over time). Many studies show the effect of ephedrine on weight&#xD;
      loss that began in 1974 with patients on food diets. Ephedrine used in various strengths and&#xD;
      with a number of different combinations has shown to be effective and safe, especially when&#xD;
      directed by a physician. There is only one study where ephedrine has been used in patients&#xD;
      after bariatric surgery. In that study, both the patient and medical staff knew they were&#xD;
      taking ephedrine (i.e., they were not &quot;blinded&quot;). The patients who were not losing weight or&#xD;
      had measured low metabolic rates were treated with ephedrine. The patients taking ephedrine&#xD;
      lost more weight after surgery than those not taking ephedrine. While this is a significant&#xD;
      finding, the study was not designed to be the best test of the effects of ephedrine. The best&#xD;
      test is where neither the patients nor the medical staff know if the patient is taking the&#xD;
      active drug (double blind). All patients enrolled into the Research Study will receive&#xD;
      capsules that contain either ephedrine and caffeine (the active drug) or identical capsules&#xD;
      with no active ingredient (called a &quot;placebo&quot;). Neither group of patients will know which set&#xD;
      of capsules they receive. The expected duration of treatment in the Study is 7 months from&#xD;
      the day of surgery. This is a single site study. All patients will have their gastric bypass&#xD;
      performed through Oregon Weight Loss Surgery at Legacy Good Samaritan Hospital. The&#xD;
      investigators expect to study 200 patients with 100 receiving the study drugs (ephedrine and&#xD;
      caffeine in a capsule) and 100 receiving placebo (inactive ingredients in an identical&#xD;
      capsule) over approximately 6 months.&#xD;

      Research Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to apply an effective medical weight loss treatment to post&#xD;
      bariatric surgery patients to enhance their weight loss through stimulation of thermogenesis&#xD;
      and lipolysis and retention of lean body mass. This treatment using ephedrine with&#xD;
      phosphodiesterase inhibitor (caffeine or theophylline) has been extensively documented as&#xD;
      safe and effective in the medical weight loss setting but has not been applied to&#xD;
      post-bariatric surgery patients in a placebo controlled, double blind, randomized study. From&#xD;
      preliminary studies this treatment should be effective, especially in the treatment of&#xD;
      post-surgical patients who continue to have difficulty losing weight despite good activity&#xD;
      levels and significant calorie restriction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Relevance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Raum and others have been treating patients presenting with low metabolic rates during&#xD;
      medical and bariatric surgery induced weight loss for many years with ephedrine in&#xD;
      combination with caffeine and/or theophylline. All the literature outlined below for the last&#xD;
      40 years have been conducted only during medical weight loss. There are no randomized trials&#xD;
      in surgical patients. Abstracts and expert opinion papers have been published but without&#xD;
      randomization or blinding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ephedrine has become controversial despite considerable evidence of its safe and effective&#xD;
      treatment of airway resistance (asthma) for 50 years, and its use for medical weight loss (to&#xD;
      stimulate REE and prevent loss of lean body mass) since 1974. An association with a&#xD;
      non-regulated food additive, ephedra sparked the initial problems with inappropriate dosing,&#xD;
      lack of physician supervision for patient selection and sensationalism in the lay press&#xD;
      unsupported by peer-reviewed studies to contradict previous favorable studies. Secondly,&#xD;
      using ephedrine and pseudoephedrine as substrate for the illegal manufacture of&#xD;
      methamphetamine, caused an aura of further unreasoned apprehension. Because ephedrine with&#xD;
      caffeine or theophylline is one of the few drug combinations that can potentially reverse a&#xD;
      low REE and allow a successful weight loss following bariatric surgery, a randomized,&#xD;
      controlled study is needed to determine if this effect is statistically and clinically&#xD;
      significant in patients having bariatric surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC AIMS Background and Current Research Following bariatric surgery, metabolic rate&#xD;
      decreases secondary to a decrease in sympathetic activity and lean body mass preventing&#xD;
      optimal weight loss (1-3). Patients reaching this &quot;plateau&quot; during weight loss be it medical&#xD;
      or surgical is well recognized. The plateau is reached when there is no longer a significant&#xD;
      difference between calories burned and calories consumed. The equation can be modified at&#xD;
      either end. High calorie intake is, by far, the most common reason given for lack of weight&#xD;
      loss. The advice provided is to decrease calorie intake. However, there is a large subgroup&#xD;
      of individuals whose metabolic rate (measured as Resting Energy Expenditure - REE or Resting&#xD;
      Metabolic Rate - RMR) decreases while caloric intake has remained low. Raum (3) has routinely&#xD;
      measured REE in bariatric surgery patients for 10 years. A low REE is commonly associated&#xD;
      with a reduced weight loss rate. Hundreds of patients have been found to have REEs&#xD;
      significantly depressed from normal (90-s100%) to a range of 45% to 80% and a mean of 65%.&#xD;
      These patients have a deficit of 500 to more than 1000 kcal per day that they would be&#xD;
      burning with a normal REE. Some patients must consume less than 700 to 1000 kcal/day just to&#xD;
      maintain their weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The methods to increase REE, sympathetic activity, brown adipose tissue activity include&#xD;
      exercise, and several drugs including catechins (green tea), caffeine or theophylline with&#xD;
      ephedrine, and capsaicin (1). Many clinical trials have demonstrated the effect of ephedrine&#xD;
      on weight loss (4-7). A significant effect of ephedrine on increasing metabolism is thought&#xD;
      to be one of the mechanisms for weight loss. Stimulation of brown adipose tissue was thought&#xD;
      to contribute to 15% of the increase in thermogenesis and the remainder due to thermogenesis&#xD;
      in muscle (8). Combinations of ephedrine with methylxanthines (caffeine and/or theophylline)&#xD;
      are noted to be even more effective in raising metabolic rates. These effects were most&#xD;
      notable in post-obese patients who had some lost some weight, and had depressed metabolic&#xD;
      rates. REE increased 8% in the post-obese but had no effect in lean subjects. In the&#xD;
      previously obese subjects, the ephedrine-methylxanthine combination normalized the defective&#xD;
      thermogenic response to a meal (9). In a 24-week trial with 20 mg of ephedrine and 200 mg of&#xD;
      caffeine tid were randomized with placebo. The ephedrine/caffeine group lost 17.5% of body&#xD;
      weight with 25% of the weight loss attributed to thermogenesis (10). The thermogenic effect&#xD;
      of ephedrine may be lost early in treatment but is restored with the addition of&#xD;
      aminophylline (11).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of ephedrine on body composition has been studied. Two groups were given a very&#xD;
      low calorie diet. Placebo or Ephedrine in combinations with or without methylxanthines and/or&#xD;
      aspirin (110 mg tid) in an 8 week trial demonstrated no side effects. The ephedrine groups&#xD;
      lost 4.5 kg more fat and 2.5 kg less lean than the placebo, significant differences. REE fell&#xD;
      13% in the placebo group, but only 8% in the ephedrine groups (18).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A few examples of the literature were highlighted above that reflect similar studies that can&#xD;
      be found in extensive reviews of ephedrine on weight loss (19-26), energy balance and&#xD;
      thermogenesis (27,28).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considerable recent controversy about the safety of ephedrine has come to pass due to the&#xD;
      widespread use of an herbal food additive, ephedra, being marketed widely beginning in the&#xD;
      late 1990s. Ephedrine had been used without controversy from the 1960s until this time. Many&#xD;
      anecdotal reports were circulated, including over 18,000 case reports. These and 550 trials&#xD;
      were reviewed in a meta-analysis (30). Of these reports less than 10% of the trials could be&#xD;
      scientifically assessed and of these only 22 consisted of a placebo with some combination of&#xD;
      ephedrine, ephedra, caffeine or other herbs. These remaining studies demonstrated a 2.2 to&#xD;
      3.6 fold increase in one or more of the following grouped subjective complaints,&#xD;
      psychological, gastrointestinal, autonomic symptoms, and/or palpitations. Presumably the&#xD;
      other 90% of actual trials did not test or did not highlight these symptoms. Other papers&#xD;
      (31-33) which were reviews of various types of reports (not designed studies) described&#xD;
      instances of acute intoxication resulting in strokes, heart attacks, seizure and even death.&#xD;
      Because of the uncontrolled nature of the data in the reports, doses, combinations with other&#xD;
      drugs, and frequency or duration of exposure were unknown, they could only state whether the&#xD;
      associations with ephedra were possible or probable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other research observed no significant adverse effects or only temporary minor effects with&#xD;
      ephedra, ephedrine and caffeine (13, 14, 34-37). These studies were double-blind placebo&#xD;
      controlled in selected populations. Multiple clinical weight loss trials have measured the&#xD;
      chronic and acute effects of combinations of ephedrine (30, 60 and 150 mg per day) with&#xD;
      caffeine (300 to 600 mg per day) up to 180 subjects over 24 weeks (10, 12-15). Acutely, mean&#xD;
      arterial pressure is increased by 9 mm/Hg and pulse by 7 beats per minute. By 8 weeks the&#xD;
      side effects of tremor, insomnia, dizziness and blood pressure initially noted with ephedrine&#xD;
      were equal to placebo. In some studies side effects were only seen at the highest dose of 50&#xD;
      mg tid (16). No adverse effects were noted with a dose of ephedrine 25 mg and caffeine 200 mg&#xD;
      tid for 10 days on cardiovascular function as measured by thoracic bio-impedance, automatic&#xD;
      sphygmomanometry, continuous electrocardiographic recording or ergometric exercise (17).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The difference between these two contrasting sets of data demonstrates that the unregulated&#xD;
      use of ephedrine-containing compounds in unknown and potentially lethal doses in susceptible&#xD;
      populations is not to be encouraged. But in preparations where dosage is known and&#xD;
      controlled, given in appropriately selected populations, ephedrine with caffeine is safe and&#xD;
      effective.&#xD;

      EXPERIMENTAL STUDY DESIGN Patients who have been medically cleared for gastric bypass surgery&#xD;
      and meet the inclusion criteria or are not eliminated by the exclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      offered the opportunity to enroll in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be enrolled in the study, IRB consents obtained, and randomized to treatment or&#xD;
      control groups prior to surgery. Patients will follow all usual preoperative and&#xD;
      postoperative surgical and medical investigations and care. This includes a baseline resting&#xD;
      energy expenditure (REE) and body composition measurement (BC) before surgery. Study visits&#xD;
      will usually occur at the same times as normal follow up visits and vital signs and weights&#xD;
      obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will begin taking ephedrine/caffeine or placebo capsules at 5 weeks after surgery in&#xD;
      a gradual tapering dose upward beginning with one capsule daily and increasing each week by&#xD;
      one capsule until taking three capsules per day. For the treatment group this would be 75 mg&#xD;
      of ephedrine and 600 mg of caffeine per day. At 8 weeks after surgery they will return for an&#xD;
      office visit, vital signs taken, BC done, symptom checklist completed and reviewed, and if&#xD;
      not experiencing any significant side effects they will be given a 6 weeks supply of&#xD;
      capsules. At 14 weeks after surgery they have and office visit with vital signs taken,&#xD;
      symptom checklist completed and reviewed and be given another 6 week supply of capsules. At&#xD;
      20 weeks after surgery they have and office visit with vital signs taken, symptom checklist&#xD;
      completed and reviewed, and an REE study will be obtained at Good Samaritan hospital and body&#xD;
      composition by bioimpedance in the clinic and be given another 6 week supply of capsules. At&#xD;
      26 weeks after surgery they have and office visit with vital signs taken, symptom checklist&#xD;
      completed and reviewed and be given another 6 week supply of capsules. At 32 weeks after&#xD;
      surgery they will return for an office visit for vital signs, a symptom checklist and an REE&#xD;
      study will be obtained at Good Samaritan hospital and body composition by bioimpedance in the&#xD;
      clinic. They will be given a taper pack of capsules that will be accomplished over 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the clinic visits noted above vital signs, and body weight will be obtained. Patients will&#xD;
      be questioned about any side effects. They will also be encouraged to call between visits if&#xD;
      they have persistent side effects, and will be given a symptom checklist to compare over the&#xD;
      phone. As usual routine medical and surgical care will be provided at these visits.&#xD;
      Adjustments in medications for blood pressure, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, nutritional&#xD;
      deficiencies and so forth will be addressed and treated as usual. Any surgical interventions&#xD;
      for wound problems, hernias, or other complications will be attended to and routine blood&#xD;
      tests or any other diagnostic tests needed, will be done. If blood pressure cannot be&#xD;
      controlled to &lt; 140/80, or pulse &lt; 100, or patient experiences excessive adrenergic side&#xD;
      effects, the treatment will be stopped, but the patient will continue with usual follow up&#xD;
      medical and surgical care. The investigators will continue to collect measurements on&#xD;
      patients who are unable to tolerate the treatment until the end of the study. Patients may&#xD;
      withdraw, however, at anytime without any repercussions and will continue to receive regular&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body composition will be measured by body impedance analysis with a Quantum III BIA from RJL&#xD;
      Systems (Michigan). This is a high quality, reproducible system using electrode placement on&#xD;
      hands and feet. While DEXA body scans may provide more detailed information the research cost&#xD;
      for these measurements in this study would exceed the cost of the medications alone. The&#xD;
      investigators have three RJL systems in the clinic and the total body lean mass compares well&#xD;
      the comparable measurements obtained with the DEXA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      REE is measured using a Sensor Medics indirect calorimeter with O2 and CO2 measurements to&#xD;
      calculate REE. This equipment is located and managed by the Respiratory Therapy Department at&#xD;
      Good Samaritan Hospital and has been calibrated, tested and used in other funded research&#xD;
      studies. The test is done fasting, without morning medications with minimal pretest activity&#xD;
      (15 minutes at rest prior to starting the test), and normal fluid balance. The equipment is&#xD;
      calibrated before each test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body weights are obtained on an electronic scale, capacity 800 pounds, with shoes off and&#xD;
      patients are advised to wear the same light weight clothes at each visit. The scale's&#xD;
      calibration is checked quarterly (a requirement of current and prior research studies).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators use a Welch-Allyn automatic cuff for blood pressure and pulse. Two&#xD;
      measurements are obtained in each arm at each visit. The investigators have multiple size&#xD;
      cuffs to match upper arm diameter. Calibration checked quarterly as research protocols have&#xD;
      required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power analysis was performed with results from our previous studies in non-randomized&#xD;
      subjects treated for 2 months.&#xD;
