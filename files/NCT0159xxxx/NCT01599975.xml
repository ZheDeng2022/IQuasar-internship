    <textblock>
      This study is being done to see if a drug called long acting methylphenidate (Concerta) is&#xD;
      safe and effective as a treatment for problems with mental function in adults infected with&#xD;
      HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subset of patients with HIV-associated memory loss have a defect in the speed with which&#xD;
      they learn and process information. Methylphenidate drugs, such as Ritalin or Concerta, have&#xD;
      been shown on tests to improve the ability to rapidly absorb information; these tests are&#xD;
      called &quot;reaction time tests&quot;. These drugs are already FDA-approved to treat Attention Deficit&#xD;
      Disorders: ADD or ADHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline, all subjects get tests of memory and brain function; then they are split into&#xD;
      two groups. One group on this study will receive Concerta for 2 weeks, and a second group&#xD;
      will receive a placebo x 2 weeks. After that period both groups will receive memory and other&#xD;
      tests of brain function, and then the groups will switch. The first group will receive&#xD;
      placebo and the second will receive Concerta x 2 weeks, followed by more memory and&#xD;
      neurological tests. After that all subjects will have the option to receive Concerta for free&#xD;
      for 8 more weeks. At the last visit all subjects get memory and brain tests again.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are 11 study visits in 14 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part I of the study one-half of the subjects will receive ConcertaTM and one-half will&#xD;
      receive placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 2 weeks all subjects will stop their study medication for 2 week (the &quot;washout&#xD;
      period&quot;), and then all of the subjects who received placebo will then receive 2 weeks of&#xD;
      methylphenidate, and all of the subjects who received long acting methylphenidate will&#xD;
      receive placebo for 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject will be invited to enter Part II of the study if she/he still qualifies. During&#xD;
      this portion of the study, the subject will receive ConcertaTM for 8 weeks. The subject does&#xD;
      not have to be on Part II of this study to be on this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening visit. (4 hours)&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a screening medical visit. If the subject passes the initial questions for&#xD;
      depression and dementia, the subject will undergo the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a physical examination including a medical and medication history, which will&#xD;
      include telling the study staff about all of the drugs that the subject has taken recently or&#xD;
      are currently taking, and measurement of vital signs (blood pressure, temperature, height,&#xD;
      weight, pulse,breathing rate).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject will have a physical examination including a detailed test of reflexes, muscle&#xD;
      strength,gait, balance, and other functions of brain and nerves to see if he/she has any&#xD;
      nerve damage and to see how the brain functions. The subject will take a group of tests&#xD;
      called neuropsychological tests. The subject will answer questions, do simple tasks with&#xD;
      their hands, and see how long it takes her/him to walk a short distance. Some of these&#xD;
      questions are to test the subject for depression and memory abilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject will need to bring in your most recent CD4 cell count (T-cell counts) and HIV&#xD;
      viral load on this visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the initial screening questionnaires show that the subject fulfills some of the&#xD;
      requirements of the study, the subject will be asked to have about 2 tablespoons of blood&#xD;
      drawn from a vein in his/her arm, a urine test for drugs of abuse, and a urine pregnancy test&#xD;
      if the subject is female and able to bear children. Some of the blood tests are to measure&#xD;
      liver and kidney function and to see if the subject is anemic. The subject will have an EKG&#xD;
      (electrocardiogram).&#xD;
&#xD;
      . Entry Visit (Week 0) If the subject qualifies for this study the subject will return to the&#xD;
      clinic for an entry visit. The entry visit will occur within 2 weeks of Visit 1. This visit&#xD;
      will take about 3-4 hours. At this visit you will undergo the following procedures: The&#xD;
      subject will have a short physical examination and be asked questions about your health and&#xD;
      the medications she/he is taking. The subject will be asked to complete another set of tests&#xD;
      of memory and mental function. If the subject is a woman of child bearing potential he/she&#xD;
      will have a pregnancy test at this visit and every 4 weeks thereafter. Once the subject has&#xD;
      completes the entry tests, she/he will be assigned by chance (like flipping a coin) to either&#xD;
      ConcertaTM, or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study treatment groups are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A: ConcertaTM 2 tablets taken with food in the morning OR Group B: Placebo, 2 tablets&#xD;
      taken with food in the morning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first dose of study medication will be given in the clinic. She/he will be asked to take&#xD;
      1 tablet of study medication in the clinic and be observed for 2 hours afterward to see if&#xD;
      you have any immediate side effects. The blood pressure will be checked again. The first dose&#xD;
      of study medication is only 1 tablet of the study medication. On the day after this clinic&#xD;
      visit she/he will take your second dose of study medication. This will be 2 tablets of study&#xD;
      medication. Thereafter the subject will be taking 2 tablets of study medication in the&#xD;
      morning. The study medications will be given as a 2-week supply.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 1 Visit (1 hour) The subject will be asked brief medical questions and receive a brief&#xD;
      physical exam with vital signs and an EKG if indicated. She/he will be asked for a urine&#xD;
      sample. She/he will have one short memory test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 2 Visit (3 hours) He/she will be asked to come to clinic before he/she takes the daily&#xD;
      dose of study medication. He/she are asked to bring your study medications with them, and to&#xD;
      take the study medication in the presence of the study staff, who will note the time. He/she&#xD;
      will be asked brief medical questions and receive a brief physical exam and a detailed test&#xD;
      of his/her brain and nerve function. He/she will have an EKG and a blood test of about 2&#xD;
      tablespoons to check liver and kidney function, and to check for anemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      She/he will also be asked questions about emotions, memory function, and ability to do simple&#xD;
      tasks. If she is a woman able to become pregnant she will be asked to have a urine pregnancy&#xD;
      test. After this visit the subject will stop taking study medications for 2 weeks (2 week&#xD;
      washout period).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 4 (4 hours) He/she will be asked brief medical questions and receive a brief physical&#xD;
      exam, and a detailed test of brain and nerve function. He/she will be asked questions about&#xD;
      emotions, memory function, and ability to do simple tasks. He/she will be given a new supply&#xD;
      of study medications. The subject will be asked to take 1 tablet of study medication in the&#xD;
      clinic and be observed for 2 hours afterward to see if he/she has immediate side effects.&#xD;
      Blood pressure will be checked again. On the day after this clinic visit the subject will&#xD;
      take 2 tablets of study medication. Thereafter the subject will be taking 2 tablets of study&#xD;
      medication in the morning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 5 (1 hour) The subject will be asked brief medical questions and receive a brief&#xD;
      physical exam and an EKG if indicated. The subject will be asked for a urine sample. He/she&#xD;
      will have one short memory test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 6 (4 hours) The subject will be asked to come to clinic before he/she takes the daily&#xD;
      dose of study medication. The subject is asked to bring your study medications with them, and&#xD;
      to take the study medication in the presence of the study staff, who will note the time.&#xD;
      He/she will be asked brief medical questions and receive a physical exam and a detailed test&#xD;
      of brain and nerve function. The subject will be asked questions about emotions, memory&#xD;
      function, and ability to do simple tasks. The subject will have a blood test (about 2&#xD;
      tablespoons) to check kidney and liver function, and to check for anemia. The subject will&#xD;
      have an EKG. If she is a woman able to become pregnant she will be asked to have a urine&#xD;
      pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the Week 6 visit is completed, and if blood and other tests indicate that the subject&#xD;
      is still eligible, the subject will be invited to enter the Part II phase of the study. In&#xD;
      the Part II phase,and sign a new consent. In Part II all subjects will receive ConcertaTM for&#xD;
      the next 8 weeks. After the new consent is signed, the subject receives a two week supply of&#xD;
      Concerta.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 8 (1 hour) The subject will be asked brief medical questions and receive a brief&#xD;
      physical exam and an EKG if indicated. He/she will be given a 2 week supply of Concerta.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 10 (1 hour) The subject will be asked brief medical questions and receive a brief&#xD;
      physical exam and an EKG if indicated. If she is female she will be asked to give urine for a&#xD;
      pregnancy test .The subject will be given a new 2-week supply of Concerta.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 12 (1 hour) The subject will be asked brief medical questions and receive a brief&#xD;
      physical exam and an EKG if indicated. He/she will be given a 2 week supply of Concerta.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 14 (4 hours) The subject will be asked brief medical questions and receive a physical&#xD;
      exam including vital signs and a detailed test of brain and nerve function. He/she will be&#xD;
      asked questions about emotions, memory function, and ability to do simple tasks. She/he will&#xD;
      again receive memory questionnaires and a quality of life questionnaire. She/he will receive&#xD;
      an EKG. If she is a woman able to become pregnant she will be asked to have a urine pregnancy&#xD;
      test. After thisvisit the study ends.&#xD;
