  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will explore altered heparin responsiveness (AHR) in cardiac surgical patients&#xD;
      undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) requiring systemic anticoagulation with heparin. The&#xD;
      investigators will evaluate the hypothesis that AHR may be directly related to, modulated or&#xD;
      mediated by interactions between heparin, antithrombin (AT), the heparin-AT complex, and one&#xD;
      or more acute phase proteins. The investigators are particularly interested in identifying&#xD;
      patients with &quot;true heparin resistance&quot;, that is, patients who demonstrate AHR even after&#xD;
      antithrombin-replenishment in the presence of an adequate systemic dose of heparin.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study uses a prospective, randomized, open-label cross-over design to evaluate the&#xD;
      responses to recombinant human AT (rhAT) and/or supplemental heparin for restoration of&#xD;
      heparin-responsiveness in the presence of biomarkers of acute inflammation, so called acute&#xD;
      phase reactants. Our ultimate goal is, of course, to apply this knowledge to optimize&#xD;
      perioperative management of anticoagulation in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will first identify enrolled patients with altered heparin responsiveness (AHR) as defined&#xD;
      by an ACT &lt; 450 seconds (the MGH standard target ACT after the initial dose of heparin for&#xD;
      CPB). Patients who achieve an ACT &gt; 450 sec will not enter the randomization phase of the&#xD;
      study, their participation in the study will be complete and their routine clinical care will&#xD;
      continue unaltered. Those with AHR (post-heparin ACT &lt; 450 sec) will be randomized to receive&#xD;
      either supplemental heparin or supplemental AT. Those that fail to achieve an adequate ACT&#xD;
      after the first supplementation will cross-over to receive the alternate supplement. Blood&#xD;
      samples (totaling at most 20 ml) will be taken at each step to measure heparin level, AT&#xD;
      level, AT activity. Once a patient is placed onto cardiopulmonary bypass their participation&#xD;
      in the study will be complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By design, this study replicates routine clinical management of heparin anticoagulation for&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary bypass at the MGH. Most patients (80%) coming to cardiac surgery who will&#xD;
      undergo CPB respond adequately to a routine initial bolus dose of heparin (ACT &gt; 450 after&#xD;
      350 U/kg); as noted, subjects in this study that achieve the target ACT will be managed&#xD;
      according to routine clinical practice without further testing or intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Under routine care, patients with an inadequate initial response to heparin receive either&#xD;
      supplemental heparin (150 U/kg) or pooled human antithrombin (1000 Units), or both. In this&#xD;
      study, subjects with inadequate heparin response (ACT &lt; 450) after the initial heparin bolus,&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to two comparison groups; half will receive supplemental heparin&#xD;
      (150 U/kg) and half will receive AT (1000 IU). Subjects who fail to respond to their assigned&#xD;
      first intervention will cross-over to receive the alternate intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some subjects may not achieve the target ACT despite receiving both supplemental heparin and&#xD;
      AT comprising a group of patients with &quot;true heparin resistance&quot; whose coagulation profiles&#xD;
      can be further characterized to better understand the mechanisms of the resistance. These&#xD;
      subjects will be considered to have completed the study even though they are not yet on&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary bypass and will be managed according to the best clinical judgment of their&#xD;
      physicians. They may receive additional heparin, additional AT, fresh-frozen plasma, or any&#xD;
      combination of these. These patients may be at risk for thrombotic complications during the&#xD;
      post-operative period. Accordingly, when clinically appropriate, these individuals may be&#xD;
      referred for further evaluation of their coagulation status, but these evaluations will not&#xD;
      be done as part of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pathophysiological risk-factor association study that seeks to better understand&#xD;
      the phenomenon of altered heparin responsiveness. Accordingly, there is no specific study&#xD;
      endpoint apart from achieving an ACT of &gt; 450 sec. In all enrolled subjects we will measure&#xD;
      the levels of three acute phase reactants, Factor VIII, fibrinogen and CRP, heparin levels&#xD;
      (anti Xa), AT level (immunofixation) and AT activity after the initial heparin dose. For all&#xD;
      subjects who do not achieve and ACT of &gt; 450 we will also measure additional heparin levels&#xD;
      (anti Xa), AT level (immunofixation), and AT activity after each intervention in the&#xD;
      randomization/crossover phase. The total amount of blood taken for the research-specific&#xD;
      laboratory test is less than 20 ml.&#xD;
