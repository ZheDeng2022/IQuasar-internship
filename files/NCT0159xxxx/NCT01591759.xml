      This investigation will explore the impact of 8 weeks of citicoline treatment on cognitive&#xD;
      function, clinical state and substance use in 40 individuals with mild traumatic brain injury&#xD;
      (mTBI).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains a major cause of death and disability within the United&#xD;
      States. Approximately 1.4 million individuals sustain a TBI each year, and currently, more&#xD;
      than 5.3 million Americans or 3% of the general population live with disabilities associated&#xD;
      with a TBI, resulting in enormous financial, physical and psychosocial burdens to the&#xD;
      patients, their families and society. The issue of TBI has never been more salient, as it is&#xD;
      now labeled the &quot;signature wound&quot; of the current conflict in Iraq and Afghanistan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with mTBI often experience a variety of symptoms including headache, dizziness,&#xD;
      fatigue, irritability, depression, anxiety, insomnia, reduced alcohol tolerance, and problems&#xD;
      with cognitive function. In acute stages, cognitive deficits may affect multiple domains and&#xD;
      be severe enough to interfere with everyday activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed investigation will explore the impact of 8 weeks of citicoline treatment on&#xD;
      cognitive function, clinical state and substance use in 40 individuals with mTBI. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that individuals with mTBI who receive citicoline will demonstrate&#xD;
      improvements in cognitive performance relative to their own pre-treatment levels as well as&#xD;
      to those randomized to placebo. Specifically, the investigators expect the greatest&#xD;
      improvement on frontal/executive measures following treatment with citicoline. In addition,&#xD;
      the investigators also hypothesize that 8 weeks of treatment with citicoline will result in a&#xD;
      reduction of comorbid substance use and improvements in clinical state measures relative to&#xD;
      both pre-treatment levels and those randomized to receive placebo. Given the relationship&#xD;
      between cognitive function and clinical state, the investigators expect a primary improvement&#xD;
      in cognitive function will likely precede the expected improvement of mTBI-related symptoms.&#xD;

    <measure>Functional MRI and Diffusion Tensor Imaging Changes with Citicoline Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and at treatment week 8</time_frame>
    <description>All functional MR imaging (fMRI) will be performed on the 3 Tesla (3T) scanner retrofitted with a whole body echo-planar coil with a TIM upgrade. The challenge paradigms will be a Masked Affect paradigm, the Multi-Source Interference Task (MSIT), and a Trauma-Related Emotional Counting Stroop. In addition, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) will be acquired to assess white matter microstructure integrity by measuring fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD).</description>
