  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, multicenter study evaluating the safety, pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      profile, and preliminary efficacy of ABT-199 in combination with Bendamustine/Rituximab in&#xD;
      approximately 60 subjects with relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. This study will&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of ABT-199 in approximately 60 subjects when&#xD;
      administered in combination with Bendamustine/Rituximab following a dose escalation scheme,&#xD;
      with the objective of defining the dose limiting toxicity and the maximum tolerated dose.&#xD;
