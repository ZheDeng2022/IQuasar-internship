      Dietary pulses, more commonly known as &quot;legumes&quot;, are generally recognized as healthy&#xD;
      components of the diet. Canada's Food Guide encourages consumptions of meat alternatives,&#xD;
      such as beans &quot;more often&quot;; and the dietary guidelines for Americans both recommend&#xD;
      consumption of 3 cups of legumes per week. However, there still remain insufficient&#xD;
      information on the usefulness of these foods in protecting heart health. To improve&#xD;
      evidence-based guidance for non-oil-seed pulse recommendations, the investigators propose to&#xD;
      conduct a systematic review of clinical studies to assess the effect of eating pulses in&#xD;
      exchange for other foods on measures of heart disease risk and blood sugar control in humans.&#xD;
      The systematic review process allows the combining of the results from many small studies in&#xD;
      order to arrive at a pooled estimate, similar to a weighted average, of the true effect. The&#xD;
      investigators will be able to explore whether eating pulses has different effects between men&#xD;
      and women, in different age groups, in people with high or normal sugar or blood fat levels,&#xD;
      and whether or not the effect of pulses depends on how much/often they are eaten. The&#xD;
      findings of this proposed knowledge synthesis will help improve the health of Canadians&#xD;
      through informing recommendations for the general public, as well as those at risk of heart&#xD;
      disease and diabetes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Dietary non-oil-seed pulses (chick peas, beans, lentils, peas) are a source of&#xD;
      slowly digestible carbohydrate, vegetable protein, and fibre. Canada's Food Guide encourages&#xD;
      consumption of meat alternatives, such as beans, &quot;more often&quot;, and the dietary guidelines for&#xD;
      Americans recommend 3-cups of legumes per week. The American Heart Association (AHA)&#xD;
      recommends the consumption of legumes at least twice a week for cardiovascular health, while&#xD;
      the European (EASD), Canadian (CDA), and American (ADA) Diabetes Associations recommend the&#xD;
      consumption of dietary pulses as a means of improving diabetes control. The evidence on which&#xD;
      these recommendations are based, however, has been graded as low. The evidence to support&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk reduction health claims for pulses has also been deemed insufficient, and&#xD;
      obesity, blood pressure, and dyslipidemia guidelines have not addressed pulses in their&#xD;
      recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Need for a review: The low-grade of evidence on which heart and diabetes association&#xD;
      recommendations are based and the lack of data to support health claims and other&#xD;
      cardiometabolic recommendations represent an urgent call for stronger evidence. A systematic&#xD;
      review and meta-analysis of controlled feeding trials remains the &quot;Gold Standard&quot; of evidence&#xD;
      for nutrition guidelines development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To provide evidence-based guidance for public health policy, health claims, and&#xD;
      nutrition guidelines relating to dietary pulses, we will conduct a series of systematic&#xD;
      reviews and meta-analyses (knowledge synthesis) of controlled feeding trials to assess the&#xD;
      effect of pulses on markers of cardiometabolic risk in humans, specifically lipid endpoints&#xD;
      with therapeutic targets, glycemia, blood pressure and body weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: The planning and conduct of the proposed meta-analyses will follow the Cochrane&#xD;
      handbook for systematic reviews of interventions. The reporting will follow the Preferred&#xD;
      Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials&#xD;
      will be searched using appropriate search terms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study selection: Intervention trials that investigate the effect of exchanging dietary pulses&#xD;
      for other diets on cardiometabolic risk outcomes in humans will be included. Studies that are&#xD;
      &lt;3-wks duration, lack a control, or report non-isocaloric comparisons will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data extraction: Independent investigators (≥2) will extract information about study design,&#xD;
      sample size, subject characteristics, pulse form, dose, follow-up, and the composition of the&#xD;
      background diets. Mean±SEM values will be extracted for all outcomes. Standard computations&#xD;
      and imputations will be used to derive missing variance data. Risk of bias and study quality&#xD;
      will be assessed using the risk of bias tool and the Heyland Methodological Quality Score&#xD;
      (MQS), respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes: The 4 proposed analyses will each assess a set of outcomes related to a different&#xD;
      area of cardiometabolic control: (1) lipid control (LDL-C, ApoB, TC:HDL, non-HDL-C,&#xD;
      ApoB:ApoA-1), (2) glycemic control (fasting glucose and insulin, HOMA-IR, glycated blood&#xD;
      proteins), (3) body weight control, and (4) blood pressure control. Where data for both&#xD;
      change-from-baseline differences and end differences are equally available, we will use the&#xD;
      difference in change from baseline as the primary end point for analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data synthesis: Separate pooled analyses stratified by underlying disease status will be&#xD;
      conducted for each area of metabolic control using the Generic Inverse Variance method with&#xD;
      random effects models. Random-effects models will be used even in the absence of&#xD;
      statistically significant between-study heterogeneity, as they yield more conservative&#xD;
      summary effect estimates in the presence of residual heterogeneity. Paired analyses will be&#xD;
      applied to all crossover trials. Heterogeneity will be tested by Cochrane's Q and quantified&#xD;
      by I2. Sources of heterogeneity will be explored by sensitivity and subgroup analyses. A&#xD;
      priori subgroup analyses will include pulse type, pulse dose, duration of follow-up, absolute&#xD;
      and change in saturated fat intake, absolute and change in dietary fibre intake, design&#xD;
      (crossover, parallel), study quality, and baseline endpoint values. An a priori subgroup&#xD;
      analysis for absolute and change in sodium intake will replace that for absolute and change&#xD;
      in saturated fat intake in the blood pressure analysis. Significant unexplained heterogeneity&#xD;
      will be investigated by additional post hoc subgroup analyses (e.g. age, sex, level of&#xD;
      feeding control [metabolic, supplemented, dietary advice], washout in crossover trials,&#xD;
      energy balance of the background diet, composition of the background diet [total % energy&#xD;
      from fat, carbohydrate, protein], change in cholesterol intake, absolute and change in&#xD;
      glycemic index, etc.). Meta-regression analyses will assess the significance of subgroups&#xD;
      analyses. Publication bias will be investigated by the inspection of funnel plots and&#xD;
      application of Egger's and Begg's tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowledge translation plan: Results will be disseminated through traditional means such as&#xD;
      interactive presentations at local, national, and international scientific meetings and&#xD;
      publication in high impact factor journals. Innovative means such as webcasts with e-mail&#xD;
      feedback mechanisms will also be used. Knowledge Users will act as knowledge brokers&#xD;
      networking among opinion leaders and different adopter groups to increase awareness at each&#xD;
      stage. Four Knowledge Users will also participate directly as members of nutrition guidelines&#xD;
      committees. Target adopters will include the clinical practice, public health, industry,&#xD;
      research communities, and patient groups. Feedback will be incorporated and used to guide&#xD;
      analyses and improve key messages at each stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary findings: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effect of&#xD;
      dietary pulses on glycemic control in 41 controlled feeding trials. We found that pulses&#xD;
      alone or in low-glycemic index or high-fibre diets improved markers of glycemic control.&#xD;
      Although the improvement was clinically significant, it came at the expense of substantial&#xD;
      inter-study heterogeneity. Knowledge translation from this preliminary project has already&#xD;
      begun. It has provided a rationale for a large trial of the effect of pulses in type 2&#xD;
      diabetes to address some of the identified sources of heterogeneity and is being used in the&#xD;
      development of the 2013 CDA Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) for Nutrition Therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: The proposed project will aid in knowledge translation related to the effects&#xD;
      of dietary pulses on cardiometabolic risk, strengthening the evidence-base for dietary&#xD;
      recommendations and health claims and improving health outcomes through informing healthcare&#xD;
      providers and patients, stimulating industry innovation, and guiding future research.&#xD;
