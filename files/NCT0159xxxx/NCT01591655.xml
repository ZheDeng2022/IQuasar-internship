    <textblock>
      The objective of this clinical study is to compare the safety and efficacy of mapracorat&#xD;
      ophthalmic suspension, 3% with its vehicle for the treatment of postoperative inflammation&#xD;
      and pain following cataract surgery. Participants from the United States and Canada will be&#xD;
      recruited for this study.&#xD;

    <time_frame>8 days</time_frame>
    <description>Anterior chamber (AC) cells were assessed using a 0 to 4 grading scale by an ophthalmologist using slip lamp biomicroscopy. A slit lamp examination of the lids, conjunctiva, limbus, cornea, anterior chamber, vitreous, and lens was performed without pupil dilation. Accumulation of white blood cells in aqueous was assessed. The grades were defined as: 0 = No cells seen; 1 = 1 - 5 cells; 2 = 6 - 15 cells; 3 = 16 - 30 cells; 4 = &gt;30 cells. Complete resolution of AC cells was defined as Grade 0.</description>

A slit lamp examination of the lids, conjunctiva, limbus, cornea, anterior chamber, vitreous, and lens was performed without pupil dilation. Accumulation of white blood cells in aqueous was assessed. The grades were defined as: 0 = No cells seen; 1 = 1 - 5 cells; 2 = 6 - 15 cells; 3 = 16 - 30 cells; 4 = &gt;30 cells. Complete resolution of AC cells was defined as Grade 0.</description>
