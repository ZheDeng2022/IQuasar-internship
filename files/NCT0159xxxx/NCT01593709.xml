      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Vaccines and antiviral therapies are critical for preventing and treating viral diseases.&#xD;
      Testing these vaccines and drugs often requires healthy volunteers. To ensure that volunteers&#xD;
      are healthy and eligible to participate in these studies, they will be screened before the&#xD;
      start of the study. This screening may involve a medical history, physical exam, and blood&#xD;
      test. Other samples may also be collected. This study will help identify volunteers who are&#xD;
      eligible to participate in vaccine or antiviral therapy trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To screen volunteers for clinical trials of vaccines or drugs to treat or prevent virus&#xD;
      infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Healthy volunteers at least 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening may begin several months before the start of the clinical trial. Participants&#xD;
           may come to the National Institutes of Health clinic one or more times.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood samples&#xD;
           will be collected. Other samples may also be collected, including urine, nasal wash,&#xD;
           nasal swab, or stool samples. All samples will be stored for reference by the study&#xD;
           researchers....&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Vaccines and antiviral therapies are critical for prevention and treatment of viral diseases.&#xD;
      Testing of vaccines, antiviral medications, or live virus challenge studies in volunteers may&#xD;
      requires knowing whether the subject has been previously infected by the virus. We will&#xD;
      recruit healthy persons for this study and screen them for their eligibility to participate&#xD;
      in clinical trials of investigational vaccines or antiviral products, investigational studies&#xD;
      of licensed products, or live virus challenge studies. In most cases this will involve a&#xD;
      medical history, physical examination, and obtaining blood to test for antibodies to the&#xD;
      virus being studied in a vaccine or antiviral therapy trial or live virus challenge study. In&#xD;
      some cases blood may be tested for viral DNA or RNA and urine, stool, saliva, nasal swab, or&#xD;
      nasopharyngeal wash secretions may be tested for viruses or antibodies to the virus.&#xD;
      Additional testing, such as an electrocardiogram (EKG), chest radiograph (CXR), and pulmonary&#xD;
      function tests (PFTs) may be done. Samples will also be stored for future research. This&#xD;
      study should help us to identify a group of volunteers that will be eligible, based on&#xD;
      testing for their prior exposure to viruses, to participate in vaccine or antiviral therapy&#xD;
      trials, or live virus challenge studies, .conducted by the Laboratory of Infectious Diseases,&#xD;
      NIAID at the NIH Clinical Center.&#xD;

&#xD;
               2. Available to participate for the planned duration of the clinical trial for which&#xD;
                  the screening is being done&#xD;

                  process.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. A known condition that requires active medical intervention or monitoring to avert&#xD;
