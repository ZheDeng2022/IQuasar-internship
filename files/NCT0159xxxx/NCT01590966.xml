  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this open-label monocentric explorative pilot trial the objective is to show the&#xD;
      biodistribution of TNFα by administration of radiolabeled anti-TNFα in patients with active&#xD;
      rheumatoid arthritis and spondylarthropathy. The anti-TNFα used in this trial is certolizumab&#xD;
      pegol (Cimzia®), a pegylated Fab'-fragment of a monoclonal antibody with high specificity for&#xD;
      TNFα. Certolizumab pegol will be radiolabeled with 99mTechnetium. The aim of this study is to&#xD;
      show the TNFα triggered inflammation process in the inflamed joints, especially in patients&#xD;
      who have very early joint damage where currently other imaging methods such as X-rays are not&#xD;
      sensitive enough for detection.&#xD;

Certolizumab pegol (Cimzia®) is an engineered humanized monoclonal antibody Fab' fragment with specificity for human TNF-α, manufactured in E. coli. The antibody fragment is subsequently purified and conjugated with high molecular weight polyethylene glycol (PEG) (40kDa). Lyophilized Cimzia® will be conjugated with S-HYNIC (a bifunctional chelator). The conjugate will be radiolabeled with Tc-99m by adding 0.1 mg Tricine, 0.01 mg SnSO4 and 750 MBq Tc-99m pertechnetate. A dose of 750 MBq Tc-99m Cimzia® will be injected intravenously.</description>
