    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of aerosolized aldesleukin and&#xD;
      to see how well it works in treating patients with cancer that has spread from the original&#xD;
      tumor to the lungs. Biological therapies, such as aerosolized aldesleukin, may stimulate or&#xD;
      suppress the immune system in different ways and stop tumor cells from growing.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate toxicity in patients with lung metastases during aerosol interleukin (IL)-2&#xD;
      (aldesleukin) therapy using self-report, remote spirometry and pulse oximetry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine dose and schedule of an acceptable aerosol IL-2 regimen and correlate with&#xD;
      absolute lymphocyte count (ALC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine serum IL-2 levels on day 1 of therapy for evidence of spillover into&#xD;
      circulation and correlate with absence or presence of toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the efficacy of aerosol IL-2 treatment using Response Evaluation Criteria in&#xD;
      Solid Tumors (RECIST).&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the histology in post-surgical specimens in patients who undergo surgery for&#xD;
      lung metastases following aerosol IL-2 treatment as an optional procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate immune correlates from optional pre-treatment biopsy and post-surgical&#xD;
      specimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive aerosolized aldesleukin once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Courses repeat every&#xD;
      28 days in the absence of disease progression of unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.&#xD;

    <measure>Response of measurable lesions to aerosol aldesleukin using modified RECIST (Phase II)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 years</time_frame>
    <description>Response analysis will be performed on intent-to-treat, that is, any patient who enrolled into the expansion cohort. Patients who withdraw before the end of 2 months without responding will be considered non-responders. The two-sided 95% Clopper-Pearson confidence intervals will be calculated for the proportion of patients with responses.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>IL-2 levels in serum</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 of therapy</time_frame>
    <description>Serum IL-2 levels will be compared with maximum grade of toxicity to determine whether our hypothesis of &quot;spillover&quot; of IL-2 in the circulation - i.e. some escaping the receptor gauntlet of IL-2 receptor bearing cells in pulmonary lymphatics.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in biomarker levels</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in biomarker levels between pre- and post-treatment tissue samples will be assessed using paired t-tests (if the data are normally distributed) or Wilcoxon signed-rank tests (otherwise). Will graph the data using histograms, box plots and dot plots. With 20 patients, using a 2-sided 5% alpha, there would be 80% power to detect an effect size of 0.66 (where the effect size is the mean difference divided by the standard deviation of the differences).</description>
