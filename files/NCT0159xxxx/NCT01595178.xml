  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Smoking and drinking are two of the three leading causes of preventable deaths in the United&#xD;
      States today. Using both alcohol and tobacco significantly multiplies the risk of disease and&#xD;
      death from myocardial infarction, COPD, and multiple cancers. Combined use of these&#xD;
      substances is extremely common; people who drink are three times more likely than the general&#xD;
      population to smoke, and tobacco dependent individuals are four times more likely than the&#xD;
      general population to be alcohol-dependent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research has shown that there is a high prevalence of unmet substance abuse treatment need&#xD;
      among adult Emergency Department (ED) patients. The current project aims to conduct a pilot&#xD;
      feasibility study with 50 adult ED patients to develop a brief counseling intervention that&#xD;
      is feasible and acceptable to patients who are both smokers and at-risk drinkers to help them&#xD;
      reduce these behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overarching aim of this line of research is to find the best treatment for ED patients&#xD;
      who are combo smokers and at-risk drinkers. The study will focus on the development of an&#xD;
      intervention that will be tested in a future larger scale randomized clinical trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Smoking and drinking are the most common addictions in this country and frequently co-occur.&#xD;
      Among persons who smoke and drink, there appears to be a robust dose-response relationship,&#xD;
      with heavier drinking associated with heavier smoking and vice versa. Additionally, smokers&#xD;
      who are more alcohol dependent often report that smoking is a common way to cope with the&#xD;
      urge to drink.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research has shown that there is a high prevalence of unmet substance abuse treatment need&#xD;
      among adult Emergency Department (ED) patients. As many as 46% of ED patients have recently&#xD;
      consumed alcohol and a significant number of the 31.6 million ED injury related visits are&#xD;
      alcohol related. The prevalence rate of tobacco use among ED patients is reportedly as high&#xD;
      as 40% and contributes to significant morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For many the ED is the only place they can access medical care. Although most&#xD;
      medically-underserved individuals never seek out specialized treatment for smoking or&#xD;
      drinking, each year over 120 million people visit an ED. Since an ED visit may be a patient's&#xD;
      only point of contact with the health care system, it represents an important opportunity not&#xD;
      only to treat their emergent needs, but to screen and provide this vulnerable population with&#xD;
      appropriate alcohol and tobacco use interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention, built upon the Brief Negotiated Interview (BNI) model, aims to help&#xD;
      patients reduce harmful drinking and smoking and will be initiated during an ED visit&#xD;
      followed by 3 follow up COMBINE counseling telephone sessions post ED visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of the proposed project are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To develop an effective brief intervention for smoker- drinkers that is feasible and&#xD;
      acceptable for patients treated in the emergency department&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To identify barriers to treatment engagement and factors that facilitate successful&#xD;
      engagement in alcohol and smoking cessation treatment&#xD;
