    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of EphA2 siRNA in treating patients&#xD;
      with solid tumors that have spread to other places in the body and usually cannot be cured or&#xD;
      controlled with treatment (advanced) or have come back after a period of improvement&#xD;
      (recurrent). EphA2-targeting DOPC-encapsulated siRNA may slow the growth of tumor cells by&#xD;
      shutting down the activity of a gene that causes tumor growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety and tolerability (toxicity profile) of EphA2-targeting&#xD;
      DOPC-encapsulated siRNA (EphA2 siRNA) delivered via neutral liposome&#xD;
      (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine or DOPC) administered intravenously in&#xD;
      patients with advanced/recurrent malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) or maximal administered dose (MAD) using a&#xD;
      modified toxicity probability interval (mTPI) design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine efficacy (EphA2 expression modulation) at the MTD or MAD. II. To evaluate the&#xD;
      effect of EphA2 siRNA-DOPC on tumor and endothelial cell apoptosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To record the clinical activity (objective response, duration of response, and time to&#xD;
      treatment progression) of intravenous (IV) EphA2 siRNA -DOPC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To describe the symptom burden of patients receiving siRNA-EphA2-DOPC treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the pharmacokinetic profile of siRNA-EphA2-DOPC in blood. II. To determine&#xD;
      the effect of EphA2 siRNA-DOPC on tumor perfusion, apparent diffusion, and metabolism by&#xD;
      radiographic imaging (dynamic contrast-enhanced-magnetic resonance imaging [DCE-MRI],&#xD;
      diffusion weighted [DW]-MRI and fludeoxyglucose F-18-positron emission tomography&#xD;
      [18FDG-PET]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the impact of EphA2 siRNA-DOPC on surrogate biomarkers in blood (cell-free&#xD;
      deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA], plasma/serum markers [vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),&#xD;
      caveolin 1 (CAV1), soluble EphrinA1], and exosomes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive EphA2-targeting DOPC-encapsulated siRNA IV over 120 minutes on days 1 and 4.&#xD;
      Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.&#xD;
