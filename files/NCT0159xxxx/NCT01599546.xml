    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand reading abilities of children born preterm: their&#xD;
      cognitive profiles, the neural basis of good and poor reading abilities, and the behavioral&#xD;
      and neural factors that predict persistent difficulties. The investigators hope to learn&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  what specific skills correlate reading skills&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  if preterm children have different cognitive profiles than full term children with&#xD;
           respect to reading&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  if cognitive skills measured in kindergarten predict reading ability in the second grade&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  if parts of the brain are associated with reading skill&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  whether brain characteristics in kindergarten predict reading in second grade.&#xD;

      On the first day we will do the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. We will ask your child to complete standardized tests of language, reading and&#xD;
           intelligence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. We will ask you child to do computerized tests about grammar and higher mental&#xD;
           functions, such as memory and planning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. While your child is doing tests, you will fill out some questionnaires and answer some&#xD;
           questions about your child's health, behavior, and schooling. You may refuse to answer&#xD;
           any individual question on the questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. We will review your child's medical records. Medical record review is for review of&#xD;
           previous MRI scans and other conditions that might affect your child's ability in this&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will undergo the same cognitive and academic test battery initially at age 6&#xD;
      and again at age 8 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day of the MRI scanning:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A member of the team will ask you and your child medical information to check that it is&#xD;
           okay for your child to be tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Before your child begins the study, we will ask your child if s/he has had any&#xD;
           medications, alcohol, tobacco, or over-the-counter drugs recently. If your child is&#xD;
           taking stimulants for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder or ADHD (such as Ritalin,&#xD;
           Concerta, Dexedrine, Adderall), antihistamines, pseudoephedrine or Sudafed, we will ask&#xD;
           you to hold these medicines 24 hours before the scan. Your child can take them after the&#xD;
           scan is complete. Deferring stimulants for 24 hours is safe and commonly done by many&#xD;
           children with ADHD on weekends.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. In the fMRI scanner, your child will lay on a table that slides inside the magnet. A&#xD;
           technician will place your child's head in a head-coil (a helmet-like device) and make&#xD;
           sure that s/he is comfortable. Your child will hold onto a ball that sounds an alarm&#xD;
           when squeezed. This is a signal for the technician to stop the scan, come in to talk&#xD;
           with your child, and take him or her out of the scanner if s/he is unable to continue&#xD;
           with the tests. We will take pictures of the structure of your child's brain. During&#xD;
           this time s/he can watch part of a video of his/her choice or one from our video&#xD;
           library. In order for the brain pictures to come out right, it is very important that&#xD;
           s/he does not move her/his head while inside the scanner. In between tasks, the&#xD;
           technician will talk to your child through a microphone and ask if everything is OK.&#xD;
           Your child should respond in a loud, clear voice without moving his/her head. We hope&#xD;
           your child can complete the testing. Your child can choose to stop the testing at any&#xD;
           time s/he needs to. Your child should tell the technician if anything is uncomfortable.&#xD;
           You may sit in the scanning room if your child wants you to and if you don't have any&#xD;
           metal in your body or any other MRI exclusions.&#xD;
