      This is a prospective chart review of all extubations in the pediatric intensive care unit.&#xD;
      Over a one year period all extubations in the unit are to be recorded on a designated form&#xD;
      and standard variables charted and compared. All data will be collected from the chart,&#xD;
      retrospectively after the extubation event. Patients who fail extubation will be compared to&#xD;
      those who succeed. We aim to identify factors which contribute to extubation failures in the&#xD;
      unit, to come up with a unit specific extubation policy&#xD;

      Description of project- This is a prospective chart review to identify factors influencing a&#xD;
      successful extubation event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis- Successful extubation in a pediatric intensive care unit is dependent on&#xD;
      variables, which can be identified and the chances of success predicted. A clinical practice&#xD;
      based upon such a prediction model, will improve the quality of care provided to the&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type- Prospective chart review .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure- Over 1 year period, all planned extubations in the intensive care unit to be&#xD;
      recorded on a designated form and standard variables charted. All extubation decisions are to&#xD;
      be made by the covering attending physician and at no time, the study protocol will&#xD;
      affect/influence or alter the standard patient care. All data will be collected&#xD;
      retrospectively after the extubation event. All included patients will be assigned a unique&#xD;
      identification number (UID) by the investigator, who will secure the patient identifiers in&#xD;
      an encrypted electronic file. Extubation failure will be defined as reintubation within 72&#xD;
      hours of a planned extubation and will be further classified as early (&lt;12 hours) and late&#xD;
      (12-72 hours) extubation failure. The cause of extubation failure will be recorded (as&#xD;
      identified by the attending physician on service, who is not involved in the study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection and statistical analysis- The data will be collected on a standard form. The&#xD;
      data collected will be periodically logged in an electronic data base and analyzed.&#xD;
      Investigators will perform an interim analysis at the end of 6 months and a final analysis of&#xD;
      the data at the end of 1 year period. Since this is an observational study, all the&#xD;
      extubations in the time period, will be included. Based on 2010 data collected, for&#xD;
      monitoring unplanned extubations (300 extubations) and considering recent expansion in their&#xD;
      unit, investigators expect about 500 extubations in the time period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For statistical analysis, group that fail extubation, will be compared, with the group that&#xD;
      was an extubation success. Standard demographics (age, sex), patient disease related factors&#xD;
      (diagnosis, duration of intubation, secretions, sedation level), care factors (CPAP trials,&#xD;
      cuff leak test, use of pre-extubation decadron, p/f ratio prior to extubation), and post&#xD;
      extubation care (post extubation respiratory support, stridor, blood gas) along with any&#xD;
      complication during extubation and reintubation and reasons for reintubation will be&#xD;
      collected and compared. As two groups are being compared, bivariate analyses utilizing&#xD;
      Chi-square tests or univariate logistic regression for categorical variables and Student t&#xD;
      -tests for interval variables, will be done. Based on 9.9% extubation failure rate in 2010,&#xD;
      investigators expect ~50 extubation failures in the time frame. From the preliminary data,&#xD;
      investigators also expect a 40% difference in the primary variables of comparison (age,&#xD;
      secretions, sedation level). For statistical analysis at 95% confidence interval and 80%&#xD;
      power, investigators will be able to detect differences between groups in proportions of&#xD;
      approximately 20% with the expected sample size or differences of 25% with a 99% CI. The&#xD;
      investigators also will conduct multivariate logistic regression analysis using extubation&#xD;
      failure as the dependent variable and calculate the independent odds ratio for significant&#xD;
      predictor variables. Early Vs late extubation failures, will also be compared. From&#xD;
      literature, investigators assume 80% of extubation failures to be early (from their estimate,&#xD;
      40 early extubation failures and 10 late extubation failures, in 1 year period). They do not&#xD;
      expect statistically significant results from the numbers in present trial period, however&#xD;
      they expect to get trends to plan a further study.&#xD;
