      Summary&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introduction: Insomnia is a symptom of sleep disorders most prevalent. Primary insomnia, the&#xD;
      investigators analyzed, often related to stress states acquired, generalized anxiety and&#xD;
      stress, which are important factors that disrupt normal sleep. The investigators point out a&#xD;
      fact that still intrigue the students of medicine and sleep that is distorted perception of&#xD;
      sleep by the sleepless nights, polysomnography shows greater effectiveness than that&#xD;
      perceived by them. On the other hand, there is evidence that mindfulness techniques may&#xD;
      reduce symptoms of stress and anxiety as well as improve the general attention, which may&#xD;
      contribute to a better perception of the effectiveness of sleep. In addition, there are&#xD;
      studies showing that meditation is associated with metabolic and neurophysiological&#xD;
      characteristics similar to normal sleep. Objectives: To compare sleepless menopausal women&#xD;
      trained for 8 weeks in the technique of mindfulness insomniac postmenopausal untrained and&#xD;
      also assess the quality of sleep experienced meditators menopausal comparing them to the&#xD;
      group of healthy postmenopausal women untrained in the art.&#xD;

      Groups will be assessed by actigraphy, polysomnography and questionnaires for assessing&#xD;
      stress, depression, anxiety, quality of life, self-pity, subjective states such as sedation&#xD;
      and other physical or mental attitudes, vitality, emotional state and attentiveness.&#xD;
      Moreover, prospective memory participants will be evaluated by means of a task as close as&#xD;
      possible to real life conditions of the volunteers (green) and also the working memory is&#xD;
      assessed by a test called specific counting span. Menopausal women will be evaluated for the&#xD;
      presence or absence of bruxism compared to ordinary meditators, all postmenopausal.&#xD;
