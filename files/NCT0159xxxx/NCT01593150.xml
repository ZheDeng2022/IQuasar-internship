  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia present in 1% of population under 60&#xD;
      years of age and reaching up to 15% at 80 years. AF is associated with reduced quality of&#xD;
      life, increased morbidity, mortality and health economic costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Presentation of AF differs substantially among patients ranging from self-limiting short&#xD;
      episodes (paroxysmal AF), longstanding episodes (persistent AF) where direct current (DC)&#xD;
      cardioversion is needed, to chronic atrial fibrillation. Treatment of AF is individually&#xD;
      tailored in accordance to symptoms, type of AF and thromboembolic risk. The standard&#xD;
      treatment of symptomatic persistent AF is DC-cardioversion preceded by anticoagulant&#xD;
      treatment with Warfarin. According to guidelines DC-cardioversion can be performed when&#xD;
      anticoagulation treatment has been in therapeutic range for at least 4 weeks. However&#xD;
      introduction of Pradaxa (Dabigatran) has enabled an earlier DC cardioversion, reducing time&#xD;
      to cardioversion to a 3 week period. During anticoagulation treatment persistence of AF&#xD;
      contributes to left atrial remodeling and increases in inflammatory and neurohumoral&#xD;
      biomarkers. The prolonged duration of AF and the remodeling of the left atrium increase the&#xD;
      risk of AF recurrence after DC-cardioversion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early cardioversion of patients with persistent AF is possible if preceded by transesophageal&#xD;
      echocardiography (TEE). The TEE guided DC- cardioversion, as demonstrated in the ACUTE study,&#xD;
      is a safe and efficient alternative to conventional treatment. This treatment regime is not&#xD;
      routinely used in clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to compare early DC-cardioversion (within 72 hours) to conventional&#xD;
      treatment (Pradaxa prior to DC-cardioversion). 140 patients with persistent AF will be&#xD;
      randomized to early cardioversion preceded by TEE in accordance with guidelines or&#xD;
      conventional treatment with Pradaxa for 4 weeks prior to DC-cardioversion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will determine the outcome in the two groups regarding:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Left atrial function and size assessed by left atrial strain, left atrial ejection&#xD;
           fraction and left atrial volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inflammatory and neurohumoral biomarkers including ANP, BNP,IL6 and CRP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time to recurrence of AF (AF documented by ECG or Holter monitoring)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comprehensive transthoracic echocardiography, 12 lead ECG, biomarkers and Holter monitoring&#xD;
      will be performed at the time of randomization, 4 weeks, 3 month and 6 month post&#xD;
      DC-cardioversion. Furthermore all patients will be followed for symptomatic AF recurrence for&#xD;
      a period of one year. AF recurrence will be documented by 12 lead ECG.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia, present in about 1 % of the&#xD;
      population under 60 years of age and significantly higher among the older population,&#xD;
      reaching up to 15 % in patients at 80 years. Worldwide, the proportion of people aged over 60&#xD;
      years is growing faster than any other age group. This will inevitably result in an increased&#xD;
      prevalence of AF in the overall population. This is supported by the fact that the incidence&#xD;
      of AF has increased over the past two decades. Furthermore a number of diseases which are&#xD;
      associated with a higher prevalence of AF, such as ischemic heart disease (IHD), valvular&#xD;
      heart disease, diabetes and hypertension are also expected to increase in prevalence due to&#xD;
      the aging population. This again will contribute to an increased incidence of AF. Atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation is associated with significant increase in mortality, morbidity and a reduction&#xD;
      in quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanisms behind AF including proliferation of fibroblasts, enhanced connective tissue&#xD;
      deposition and fibrosis, all play an important part in structural remodeling of the left&#xD;
      atrium. The structural remodeling leads to electrical deterioration which is fundamental for&#xD;
      initiation of AF. The persistence of AF induces further electrophysiological remodeling,&#xD;
      shortening of atrial refractoriness and in the end persistence of AF. The vicious cycle can,&#xD;
      be reversed by restoration of sinus rhythm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatments available today range from DC cardioversion, pharmacological rhythm and rate&#xD;
      control, radiofrequency ablation to anticoagulation treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If rhythm control is desired, cardioversion to sinus rhythm is achievable by&#xD;
      DC-cardioversion. If AF is present less than 48 hours DC-cardioversion can be performed&#xD;
      without further precautions. If AF is present more than 48 hours, DC cardioversion should be&#xD;
      preceded by anticoagulation treatment with Warfarin for a minimum of 4 weeks or alternatively&#xD;
      Pradaxa for 3 weeks prior to DC-cardioversion. Early cardioversion of patients with&#xD;
      persistent AF &gt; 48 hours is possible if preceded by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)&#xD;
      and exclusion of thrombus as demonstrated in the ACUTE trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discrepancy of the results and the limitations of the earlier studies lead to inconclusive&#xD;
      results. Tendencies favouring early DC-cardioversion and an increase in haemorrhages in the&#xD;
      conventional treatment group underline the need for a randomized study with a primary aim to&#xD;
      asses' differences in effect of conventional vs. early DC-cardioversion treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the investigators knowledge no randomised study has assessed the effect of early versus&#xD;
      late DC-cardioversion in patients with persistent AF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early DC-cardioversion of persistent AF will improve left atrial function and remodeling,&#xD;
      decrease inflammatory /neurohumoral markers and increase time to recurrence of AF compared to&#xD;
      conventional treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine, if there is difference in function and size of the left atrium, prior to&#xD;
           and post cardioversion comparing early cardioversion to conventional treatment group.&#xD;
           The data for comparison will be acquired echocardiographically.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine, if there is difference in levels of inflammatory (IL-6 &amp; CRP) and&#xD;
           neurohumoral markers (ANP &amp; BNP) prior to and post cardioversion, when comparing early&#xD;
           cardioversion to conventional treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine, if there is difference in time to recurrence of, ECG or Holter verified&#xD;
           AF, when comparing early cardioversion to conventional treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine whether there is any difference in correlation between left atrial size and&#xD;
           function and neurohumoral or inflammatory biomarker levels pre/post cardioversion, when&#xD;
           comparing early cardioversion to conventional treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine, whether there is any difference in strain when analyzing TEE versus&#xD;
           transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) images of the left atrium, in patient's receiving&#xD;
           early cardioversion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients admitted to department of cardiology OUH Svendborg Hospital or referred to&#xD;
      outpatient clinic with symptomatic persistent AF, duration more than 48 hours and indication&#xD;
      for DC cardioversion. Atrial fibrillation must be verified by a 12 lead ECG. All patients&#xD;
      must be over 18 years of age, and must provide written informed consent prior to inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reversible causes for AF (thyrotoxicosis, infection, pulmonary embolism), acute coronary&#xD;
      syndrome and absolute contraindications of TEE (oesophageal spasm, stricture, perforation and&#xD;
      diverticula). Patients with diminished mental capability will not be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will undergo unblinded randomization in two groups with PROBE design which&#xD;
      includes blinded analysis of echocardiography, Holter monitoring and biomarker results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group one will receive conventional treatment with Pradaxa for a period of minimum 3 weeks&#xD;
      prior to DC cardioversion. Group two will undergo TEE followed by early DC cardioversion&#xD;
      within 72 hours. Post cardioversion treatment with Pradaxa will be applied according to&#xD;
      guidelines for a minimum of 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comprehensive transthoracic echocardiography, 12 lead ECG, biomarkers and Holter monitoring&#xD;
      will be performed at the time of randomization, 4 weeks, 3 month and 6 month post&#xD;
      DC-cardioversion. Furthermore all patients will be followed for symptomatic AF recurrence for&#xD;
      a period of one year, AF recurrence will be documented by 12 lead ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transesophageal echocardiography Patients will be examined in the fasting state, after the&#xD;
      application of topical pharyngeal anaesthesia. Left atrium and left atrial appendage will be&#xD;
      viewed in order to exclude thrombus and dynamic spontaneous echo contrast. Tissue Doppler and&#xD;
      2D images of the left atrium from 0,30,60 and 90 degrees will be acquired for the offline&#xD;
      strain analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transthoracic echocardiography Two dimensional images and tissue doppler images (TDI) of the&#xD;
      left atrium and the left ventricle will be acquired for offline strain analysis. Standard&#xD;
      evaluation of systolic function (EF, WMSI); diastolic function (E/a, DT, e', s', atrial&#xD;
      volume) and evaluation of mitral and aortic valves will be performed. Blinded offline strain&#xD;
      analysis will be performed with commercially available software. &quot;Time to peak standard&#xD;
      deviation&quot;(TPSD)a reliable measurement of overall left atrial dyssynchrony, peak strain and&#xD;
      global atrial strain will all be computed during the offline analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood specimen Will be drawn prior to cardioversion and 4 weeks post cardioversion. The blood&#xD;
      samples will be stored immediately after the collection in a - 80°C refrigerator.&#xD;
      Neurohumoral and inflammatory markers (IL 6, ANP, BNP, CRP, ect.) will be analyzed en bloc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Holter monitoring /12 lead ECG 48 hour Holter monitoring and a 12 lead ECG will take place 4&#xD;
      weeks, 3 month and 6 month post cardioversion. A recurrence of AF will be defined as AF for a&#xD;
      period of minimum 30 seconds on Holter or AF verified by 12 lead ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size Based on previous studies of changes in peak strain following DC cardioversion&#xD;
      the investigators expect a mean change in peak strain of 5.8 in the control group. The&#xD;
      investigators expect a minimum relevant difference (MIREDIF) between the two groups of ½&#xD;
      standard deviation ( 4.05 %). With an α of 0.05 and a β of 0.80 the investigators must&#xD;
      include a minimum of 63 patients in each treatment group. With an expected dropout of 10% the&#xD;
      total sample size is 140 patients included. A thorough review of medical records for a period&#xD;
      of 01/01/2010 - 01/10/2010 show that DC-cardioversions has been performed 121 times at OUH,&#xD;
      Svendborg Hospital during a period of 10 month. Based on the number of previous&#xD;
      DC-cardioversions the investigators expect an inclusion period of approximately 18 month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis Outcome and explanatory variables will be tested for normality and transformed&#xD;
      when appropriate. Univariate analyses of changes in atrial strain and neurohumeral response&#xD;
      between the two groups will be performed using unpaired t-test and simple regression.&#xD;
      Multivariate regression analysis will be used to analyze significant covariates. Analysis of&#xD;
      repeated measures will be performed in a Mixed Model approach. Time to recurrence will be&#xD;
      analysed using log-rank test and Cox Proportional Hazards Model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Considerations This clinical trial will be performed in accordance with ethical&#xD;
      principles based on the Declaration of Helsinki and will be approved by the ethics comity.&#xD;
      Prior to inclusion all patients will receive a thorough explanation of this trials nature;&#xD;
      participation will be based on signing of an informed consent. The patients may, at any given&#xD;
      time withdraw from the trial. The trial itself will be approved by ethical and scientific&#xD;
      counsels. Furthermore both patient groups will receive an already established and approved&#xD;
      treatment, and patients will therefore not be submitted to experimental treatments and/or&#xD;
      risks that such treatments may present.&#xD;
