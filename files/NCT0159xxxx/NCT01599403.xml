    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to investigate whether continuous PVB is equal in&#xD;
      efficacy to epidural anesthesia in terms of analgesia in patients with INR lower than 1.2, or&#xD;
      is continuous ICNB equal in efficacy to PCA in terms of analgesia, if patients have INRs&#xD;
      equal to or greater than 1.2.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Rib fractures are the most common injury sustained following blunt trauma. Ziegler and&#xD;
      Agarwal noted that in a population of more than 7000 trauma patients, 10% had fractured ribs.&#xD;
      These injuries are normally the hallmark of significant chest trauma; and as the number of&#xD;
      fractured ribs increases, there is an exponential increase in morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This injury therefore poses a challenging problem from both pulmonary and analgesia&#xD;
      standpoints. Significant morbidity is often the result of hypoventilation leading to&#xD;
      atelectasis, pneumonia, and respiratory failure. Pain management has been recognized as an&#xD;
      important factor in preventing these complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Good analgesia may help to improve a patient's respiratory mechanics, leading to a decreased&#xD;
      need for mechanical ventilatory support, a shortened hospital stay, and can dramatically&#xD;
      alter the course of recovery impacting both morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For healthy patients with one to two fractured ribs, systemic analgesics may suffice. For&#xD;
      more than three to four fractured ribs, studies and experience have reaffirmed the superior&#xD;
      analgesia made possible with continuous thoracic epidural, continuous thoracic paravertebral,&#xD;
      and continuous intercostal block, however, a comparative head to head trial comparing the&#xD;
      relative merits and disadvantages of each technique has not been undertaken in multiple rib&#xD;
      fracture patients. Placing a catheter, which is possible with the use of all three&#xD;
      techniques, allows the continuation of analgesia for multiple days with just one block, which&#xD;
      is an essential option when treating patients that are likely to need extended analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All options are not available for all patients, however, as the current American Society of&#xD;
      Regional Anesthesiology advises against the performance of epidural or paravertebral blocks&#xD;
      in patients with abnormal INR (at the BWH, equal or above 1.2, and/or treatment with other&#xD;
      anticoagulants such gpIIb/IIIa inhibitors (heparin and heparin-like medications are usually&#xD;
      acceptable within certain dosing time frames).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rib fractures following trauma are associated with severe postoperative pain and significant&#xD;
      morbidity. Atelectasis, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism (PE), and intensive care admission are&#xD;
      related to poor analgesia and consequent immobility and splinting during inspiration. With&#xD;
      traumatic multiple fractured ribs (MFR), concomitant lung injury is expected. The effect of&#xD;
      this injury is exacerbated when the pain of MFR leads to guarding, shallow breaths, and&#xD;
      suboptimal chest physiotherapy. Atelectasis, pneumonia, consolidation, and respiratory&#xD;
      failure ensue, necessitating or prolonging assisted ventilation and/or oxygenation and&#xD;
      increasing morbidity and mortality. Additionally, inadequately treated pain after rib&#xD;
      fractures can lead to chronic pain and global deconditioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Without the implementation of effective regional and/or neuraxial analgesia, the need for the&#xD;
      use of sedative and systemic opioid medications increases, which has the potential to&#xD;
      increase the length of stay and increase complications such as delirium, aspiration,&#xD;
      decreased mobility with subsequent greater deconditioning and increased risk for embolic&#xD;
      events, addiction, and possibly chronic pain. These risks are even higher in older&#xD;
      individuals (age &gt; 55), in whom comorbidities and poor respiratory reserves conspire to&#xD;
      increase morbidity and mortality, and who are less able to handle and recover from the side&#xD;
      effects of sedative and systemic opioid medications. Additionally, trauma patients may also&#xD;
      be at higher risk due to multiple, and often confounding, injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Options for analgesia aside from regional blocks include the use of NSAIDs, acetaminophen,&#xD;
      opioids, ketamine, and transdermal lidocaine (patch). The short-term disadvantages of NSAID&#xD;
      include gastric irritation, platelet inhibition and renal injury. Acetaminophen at high doses&#xD;
      is hepatotoxic. Powerful opioids are depressants, suppress cough, increase risk of delirium,&#xD;
      and may promote respiratory complications even as they reduce pain. Ketamine causes&#xD;
      dissociation and risk of hallucinations, often of an unpleasant nature. Assessment of head&#xD;
      and abdominal injuries can be compromised by systemic opioids or ketamine. Of note, none of&#xD;
      these medications at well tolerated doses are sufficient to greatly diminish the pain of MFR&#xD;
      during chest physiotherapy and coughing, delaying recovery, and none of these treatments can,&#xD;
      at well tolerated doses, provide sufficient analgesia without causing significant side&#xD;
      effects, even in combination. Lidocaine patches over the fracture sites are ineffective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regional/neuraxial blocks provide superior analgesia, the impact of a successful block is&#xD;
      immediate and substantial, and, especially regarding elderly, some authorities have&#xD;
      categorically stated that most 55-65 year-olds with three or four fractured ribs should&#xD;
      receive a regional block. The relative lack of systemic sedation makes it easier to monitor&#xD;
      patients with head and abdominal injuries, and the reduced need for systemic medications&#xD;
      obviates their inherent concomitant risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Though effective, the use of epidural blocks in the intubated and unresponsive patient,&#xD;
      especially in the thoracic region, is currently not widely accepted for fear of inadvertent&#xD;
      adverse neurologic complications. This said, the incidence of neurological complications&#xD;
      associated with patients who cannot respond to incidental injury associated with the&#xD;
      placement of epidural anesthesia under general anesthesia, as an example of an unresponsive&#xD;
      patient, is not precisely known. Horlocker et al state the &quot;possibility of serious&#xD;
      complications may still be as high as 0.08%.&quot; Regardless of the exact incidence rate, the&#xD;
      prevailing wisdom is that the risk benefit ratio does not support the practice of&#xD;
      epidural/deep plexus regional anesthesia in unconscious patients because of the clear&#xD;
      association of pain during placement or injection and subsequent injury, which speak to the&#xD;
      need for feedback from the patient in preventing injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In comparison to epidural analgesia, the major complication of PVB and ICNB is that of&#xD;
      pneumothorax with no documented accounts of nerve damage due to the lateral anatomic plane of&#xD;
      medication delivery in reference to the central nerve axis. However, in patients with a chest&#xD;
      tube this risk is effectively obviated. Moreover, the use of ultrasound, which greatly&#xD;
      enhances the ability to avoid of the pleura, further improves the accuracy and safety of&#xD;
      these blocks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, in view of pain relief methods providing the greatest preservation of pulmonary&#xD;
      spirometric function after thoracotomy-related rib trauma, the most effective analgesic&#xD;
      method is paravertebral analgesia, with patients having approximately 75% of their&#xD;
      preoperative values in the first 48 hours after surgery. Most other techniques e.g.&#xD;
      traditional intercostal nerve blocks, epidural local anesthetics or local anesthetic-opiate&#xD;
      combinations produce approximately a 55% preservation by 48 hours, with interpleural&#xD;
      analgesia being the least effective, with a mean of 35% preservation by 48 hours, less even&#xD;
      than TENS or cryoanalgesia. These findings suggest that a thoracic paravertebral block is the&#xD;
      best available analgesic method in rib trauma patients: however, the above studies have been&#xD;
      performed in the post-surgical setting and not the trauma setting, and concentrated their&#xD;
      findings on respiratory parameters, and not pain relief, though the two may be related.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary question the investigators wish to answer in this study is whether continuous PVB&#xD;
      is equal in efficacy to epidural anesthesia in terms of analgesia in patients with INR lower&#xD;
      than 1.2, or is continuous ICNB equal in efficacy to PCA in terms of analgesia, if patients&#xD;
      have INRs equal to or greater than 1.2 as measured by difference in visual analog pain scores&#xD;
      after 48 hours. Secondary questions are: do PVBs and ICNBs result in a favorable side effect&#xD;
      profile, lower complication rate, improved pulmonary mechanics, decreased need for&#xD;
      intubation, decreased length of intubation, reduced supplemental oxygenation needs, reduced&#xD;
      length of stay, improved speed to work with physical therapy and/or occupational therapy,&#xD;
      lesser need for short/long term rehabilitation at discharge, and lesser development of&#xD;
      chronic pain when compared to epidural block and opioid PCA in rib fracture patients.&#xD;
