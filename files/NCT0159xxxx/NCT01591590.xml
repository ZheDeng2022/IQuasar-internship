      The purpose of this study is to assess whether in a population of patients with advanced&#xD;
      colorectal cancer for which no known effective therapy is available, measuring the&#xD;
      spontaneous evolution of tumoral metabolic progression index by serial FGD PET-CT and&#xD;
      Diffusion MRI can show that tumor growth rate is related to the patient's outcome, and that&#xD;
      serial FDG PET-CT and Diffusion MRI are able to measure it.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Natural history of tumors is a poorly studied subject, the clinical evidence of some tumors&#xD;
      aggressiveness as opposed to some other's indolent behavior has never been formally assessed&#xD;
      in daily practice or in clinical studies and remains largely unpredictable. The patient's&#xD;
      populations are in fact a mix between different tumoral phenotypes that while carrying the&#xD;
      same apparent disease evolve with different outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that,in a population of patients with advanced colorectal cancer for which no&#xD;
      known effective therapy is available, measuring the spontaneous evolution of tumoral&#xD;
      metabolic progression index by serial FGD PET-CT and Diffusion MRI can show that tumor growth&#xD;
      rate is related to the patient's outcome, and that serial FDG PET-CT and Diffusion MRI are&#xD;
      able to measure it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the hypothesis is verified, this finding could:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Allow to define therapeutic strategies according to the tumoral metabolic progression&#xD;
           index.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Limit the need for randomization in the early drug development phases as each patient&#xD;
           could be considered as his own control.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To stratify patients according to their baseline metabolic growth rate in randomized&#xD;
           controlled trials with overall survival as an endpoint.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have histologically confirmed colorectal cancer that is metastatic&#xD;
             or unresectable and for which standard treatments do not exist or are no longer&#xD;
             effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The tumor should be refractory to all standard chemotherapy agents (fluoropyrimidines,&#xD;
             irinotecan, and oxaliplatin) and anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies in case of wild type&#xD;
             Kras (cetuximab or panitumumab) administered before study entry. Prior treatment with&#xD;
             bevacizumab, regorafenib and/or aflibercept is allowed but not mandatory&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants should be candidate for a Phase I study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age equal or over 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of greater than 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status ≤ 1.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        Total bilirubin within 2 × normal institutional upper limits AST/ALT/Alk Phosphatase levels&#xD;
