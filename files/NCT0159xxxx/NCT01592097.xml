  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gilenya (fingolimod) is approved for multiple sclerosis. However, it is unclear of its&#xD;
      clinical effect in the Hispanics with MS given that clinical studies had limited&#xD;
      representation of this population. It is also unclear if Gilenya would be as effective in&#xD;
      individuals with disease predominantly affecting the optic nerve and spinal cord (OSMS)&#xD;
      commonly seen in Asian populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To compare the clinical response of Gilenya® (fingolimod) in relapsing remitting&#xD;
      OSMS and MS of Hispanic descent using ancestral markers as a biomarker of treatment response&#xD;
      and clinical disease state.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the success of Gilenya® (fingolimod)&#xD;
      treatment in patients with MS of Hispanic descent relative to their ancestral background.&#xD;
      Therapeutic success will be determined by annualized relapse rate (ARR; defined as the number&#xD;
      of relapses divided by the person years followed) after initiation of treatment with Gilenya®&#xD;
      (fingolimod)in comparison to the relapse rate in the previous 12 months. This will be&#xD;
      determined based on medical chart extraction, in-person assessment and regular clinical&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary objective of this study is to investigate whether the efficacy of Gilenya®&#xD;
      (fingolimod) is superior or equal in HW which have higher loads of Amerindian versus&#xD;
      Caucasian background with opticospinal MS (OSMS-NMO neg) versus classical MS (CMS) in the&#xD;
      first 12 months using radiological and clinical parameters. The following measures will be&#xD;
      obtained:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Number of relapse-free patients over the investigational period&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Site of relapse defined as brain or spinal cord.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Sustained Disability progression will be defined as a one point (1) increase from&#xD;
           baseline in patients with baseline EDSS score from 0 to 5.0; or half a point (0.5)&#xD;
           increase in patients with baseline EDSS score of 5-5.5 or above after 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. MRI changes as described as number of new T2 lesions and number of Gd-enhancing lesions&#xD;
           after 12 months from baseline.&#xD;

        We will recruit 50 individuals with MS who self identify Hispanic descent and are served at&#xD;
        USC clinics. Hispanic patients with clinically definite MS, defined by the newly revised&#xD;
        McDonald criteria, will be offered the opportunity to participate in this study and asked&#xD;
        to give informed consent.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically definite multiple sclerosis defined by McDonald Criteria (8) with a score&#xD;
             of 0 to 5.5 on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)(9). Inclusion will also be&#xD;

             majority of patients who are seen in the clinics with a confirmed diagnosed of MS.&#xD;
             This age range also allows for exclusion of co-morbid conditions that may be&#xD;
             associated with aging as well as pediatric cases where their disease characteristics&#xD;
             have been shown to be different).&#xD;
