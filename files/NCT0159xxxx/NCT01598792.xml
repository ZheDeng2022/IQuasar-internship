  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is the investigators intention to investigate whether a specially designed vaccine, based&#xD;
      on a genetically modified strain of the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes and called&#xD;
      ADXS11-001 is safe to use and is able to boost the immune system of patients presenting with&#xD;
      Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) associated oropharyngeal cancer (OPSCC). It is hoped that the&#xD;
      vaccine will boost the immune system so that immune cells with cell killing properties are&#xD;
      able to attack any cancer cells remaining after the patients have been treated. However, the&#xD;
      vaccine is so novel the investigators are not sure whether it is able to do this and before&#xD;
      they can answer that question in a larger group of patients they need to make sure that the&#xD;
      vaccine is safe to use and has some effect on the immune system in the patients for whom they&#xD;
      intend its ultimate use. In a previous study, patients with incurable cervix cancer which is&#xD;
      caused by the same virus, were vaccinated with ADXS11-001. Although all patients vaccinated&#xD;
      experienced flu-like symptoms, patients tolerated the vaccine well with no patient suffering&#xD;
      long term adverse effects of vaccination. However, because the patients and cancer type was&#xD;
      so different in this earlier study, the investigators need to test whether ADXS11-001 is also&#xD;
      safe in patients with HPV associated OPSCC. That said, the earlier study guided the dosing&#xD;
      schedule for the current study and patients entering the REALISTIC trial will receive lower&#xD;
      doses than those administered to patients in the earlier cervix cancer study. It is hoped&#xD;
      that by doing this, patients will experience fewer side effects of vaccination without&#xD;
      reducing the chances of stimulating the immune system.&#xD;
