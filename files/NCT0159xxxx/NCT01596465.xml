  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our objective was to test two educational interventions for teaching cardiac auscultation:&#xD;
      self-directed learning using portable audio files versus a single, massed multimedia lecture&#xD;
      intervention similar to current best practice, to determine which would most effectively&#xD;
      increase recognition of common cardiac sounds by physicians. The investigators hypothesized&#xD;
      that doctors learning on their own time could better improve their skills.&#xD;

      Participants All non-cardiologist physicians were eligible for the study and responded to&#xD;
      recruitment advertising. Participants were 83 non-cardiologist physician volunteers (57&#xD;
      practicing physicians, 26 residents in training) from one Academic Independent Medical Center&#xD;
      in the Northeastern United States enrolled between January 11, 2011 and February 25, 2011.&#xD;
      Participants were randomized by study investigators using a table of random numbers. All&#xD;
      participants were given an MP3 player at the time of enrollment for compensation of their&#xD;
      time, but received no grade for participation. Participants provided their informed consent&#xD;
      before enrolling in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Educational Interventions Following the pretest, participants in the interventional arm of&#xD;
      the study were given an MP3 player which contained eight, 15-second heart sound files (7&#xD;
      pathologic heart sound files and 1 normal heart sound file) alternated with nine leisure&#xD;
      songs. MP3 players could play files in order or &quot;shuffle&quot; files in random order. Each heart&#xD;
      sound file was introduced by the narrated phrase &quot;Identify this sound,&quot;, followed by 10 beats&#xD;
      of a heart sound recording, then the narrated identification of the heart sound. Participants&#xD;
      were asked to use the MP3 player in order to improve their auscultation skills as often as&#xD;
      they could and asked to record their activities while listening, but were given no further&#xD;
      training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the pretest, participants in the control arm received a 1-hour multimedia lecture&#xD;
      (Power Point) taught by the same faculty member (AGK), which reviewed the pathophysiology,&#xD;
      exacerbating and relieving factors, as well as visual diagrams of the heart sounds. The&#xD;
      normal and seven pathologic heart sounds were played for participants during the lecture for&#xD;
      a total of 2 minutes through high-quality home stereo speakers, exposing learners to 1280&#xD;
      beats in the 1-hour session. Abnormal sounds were taught in groups of systolic, diastolic and&#xD;
      extra sounds, and were first introduced by name, and then as unknowns using mixed practice in&#xD;
      each of the three sections. At the end of the session, control group participants were given&#xD;
      an MP3 player with no heart sound files as honoraria. Both the intervention and control group&#xD;
      were told they would be retested at 12 weeks. Both were given a paper copy of the Power Point&#xD;
      slides for self-study, but had no electronic access to the original slides. Both groups were&#xD;
      asked not to discuss the study with the other participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Content of the audio files The audio files of the heart sounds were obtained from actual&#xD;
      patients and have validity evidence generated in prior studies. The pathologic sounds&#xD;
      included aortic stenosis, aortic insufficiency, mitral stenosis, mitral insufficiency, mitral&#xD;
      valve prolapse, S3, S4, and the normal heart sound. These heart sounds collectively represent&#xD;
      the most important auscultatory findings according to a previously published national survey&#xD;
      of residency program directors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement All participants took a 15-question pretest in addition to a posttest at 12 weeks&#xD;
      using identical heart sound files to those used in training. Tests consisted of 8-second&#xD;
      clips of each heart sound file, with 10 beats of each sound. Participants were given 15&#xD;
      seconds after each question to choose the correct response from an extended match list that&#xD;
      included 9 choices, one of which was not represented among the training materials (&quot;benign&#xD;
      flow murmur&quot;). Each of the 7 pathologic heart sounds were represented twice, with normal&#xD;
      heart sounds represented once. The order of questions for the test was randomly selected. The&#xD;
      same speakers used in the lecture format were also employed utilized for testing. Study&#xD;
      examiners tested the speaker sound quality before each test. All tests were independently&#xD;
      hand-graded by two graders, and all discrepancies in handwriting and scoring were resolved by&#xD;
      consensus of both investigators. Grades were not shared with participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups were asked to rate their prior experience with pathologic heart sounds, including&#xD;
      observation and feedback they have received, satisfaction with the teaching modality and&#xD;
      confidence in their auscultatory skill at the pretest and posttesting. Both groups audited&#xD;
      their preference for learning style by the VARKÂ© learning style assessment instrument Version&#xD;
      7.0, at the time of enrollment. Both groups were asked to record any other methods used to&#xD;
      study auscultation during the study period. Intervention group exposure to heart sounds was&#xD;
      determined by electronic interrogation of their MP3 player at 12 weeks. Play counts recorded&#xD;
      by the device were reviewed by both study investigators and entered on an electronic&#xD;
      spreadsheet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis Demographic comparisons, Likert scales of satisfaction and pathologic heart&#xD;
      sound exposure between control and intervention groups were performed via Chi-square testing&#xD;
      and Student's t-test as appropriate. Internal consistency of the pretest was performed using&#xD;
      Cronbach's alpha. Total study time was recorded as 60 minutes for the control group, and was&#xD;
      calculated by the total number of recorded plays multiplied by 15 seconds per play for the&#xD;
      intervention group. Additional self-reported study methods and amount of exposure were&#xD;
      recorded but not added to control and intervention study time calculations. The primary&#xD;
      outcome was the difference in test score from pretest to posttest and was compared using&#xD;
      paired t-tests. Effect sizes for both arms were computed using differences in means divided&#xD;
      by pooled standard deviations. Correlations between exposure and improvement from pretest to&#xD;
      posttest in the intervention group were calculated by linear regression. Subgroup analysis of&#xD;
      intervention group participants who did not use their MP3 player between weeks 4 and 12&#xD;
      (defined as play count= 0 during time interval) was performed to approximate decay in that&#xD;
      group, and was analyzed by paired t-test. The auditory learning preference of the VARK&#xD;
      learning style inventory was characterized dichotomously as present or absent. A two-factor&#xD;
      ANOVA was performed comparing intervention and control groups with presence of auditory&#xD;
      learning style against the primary outcome as the dependent variable to determine the&#xD;
      relative effects of learning style and instructional method. Power calculations were made for&#xD;
      the observed differences between the control and intervention arms for both variables of the&#xD;
      primary objectives.&#xD;
