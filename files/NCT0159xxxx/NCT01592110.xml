    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label study to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of three&#xD;
      doses of risperidone-SABER, administered with a needle and syringe or via the DosePro&#xD;
      Needle-Free Delivery System in patients with chronic, stable schizophrenia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single ascending dose (SAD), safety and PK study in patients with&#xD;
      chronic, stable schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Patients will participate in the&#xD;
      study for a total of up to 10 weeks for Cohorts 1-3, including a Screening period of up to 35&#xD;
      days and a study treatment period of 35 days, and up to 14 weeks for Cohort 4, including a&#xD;
      Screening period of up to 35 days and a study treatment period of 63 days. Patients will be&#xD;
      assigned to one of four cohorts, and will receive a single dose of 25 mg, 50 mg or 100 mg&#xD;
      (100 mg/mL concentration) administered as a single subcutaneous (SC) injection or via the&#xD;
      DosePro Needle-Free Delivery System.&#xD;
