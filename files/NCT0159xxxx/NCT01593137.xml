  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The process of atherosclerosis is multifactorial and involves many mechanisms. The majority&#xD;
      of published works have identified endothelial dysfunction as the first step in a cascade of&#xD;
      events that culminates in plaque formation. Among the various mechanisms that occur following&#xD;
      the attack on the vessel wall, it is thought that stem cells in the form of endothelial&#xD;
      progenitor cells (EPCs) are the endothelial protection mechanism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Factors identified as cardiovascular risk factors, or rather those conditions which suppose a&#xD;
      threat to the vessel wall, should therefore be associated with low levels of EPCs. To date&#xD;
      this link has been shown in hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia, and smoking.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the lack of wall protection in situations of low levels of EPCs is clearly a&#xD;
      biomarker of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, the correction of a risk factor allows recuperation of EPCs and is&#xD;
      therefore showing itself to be a promising tool for measuring therapeutic efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tools for correcting EPC levels are not clearly defined. The effect of statins on levels&#xD;
      of EPC has been shown, and the low levels of EPCs in diabetes seem to be susceptible to&#xD;
      treatment with statins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) is slowly being elucidated but the actual mechanism&#xD;
      of its potential endothelial protection is unknown, and its effect on EPCs has not been&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liraglutide, a long-acting GLP-1 analogue, could also be an interesting option for long-term&#xD;
      vessel wall protection, but to date its ability to correct cardiovascular biomarkers such as&#xD;
      EPCs has not been studied.&#xD;
