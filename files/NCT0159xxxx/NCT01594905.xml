      Entecavir(ETV) plus Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate(TDF) combination will show effective&#xD;
      antiviral activity and prevent further development of antiviral resistance in hepatitis B e&#xD;
      antigen(HBeAg)-positive or -negative Chronic Hepatitis B(CHB) patients who experienced&#xD;
      multidrug resistance&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will orally take investigational drugs once daily for 48 weeks. All subjects&#xD;
      will be assessed at baseline, Week 4, 12, 24, 36 and 48. Evaluations at each visit will&#xD;
      include vital signs, physical examinations, laboratory tests and HBV DNA levels. They were&#xD;
      also questioned about adverse events and concomitant medications. At baseline and every six&#xD;
      months thereafter, serum will be assayed for HBV serology. Genotypic analysis will be&#xD;
      performed at baseline and 48 weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      1. It has been one of unsolved issues and unmet needs in CHB management to develop an&#xD;
           optimal combination regimen to manage multidrug resistant HBV characterized by selection&#xD;
           of variants with two or more classes A of signature genotypic resistant mutations1-3&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Currently adding on Adefovir(ADV) has been generally recommended in Lamivudine(LAM)- or&#xD;
           Telbivudine(LdT)-resistant patients but little is known about the optimal management of&#xD;
           CHB patients who developed multidrug resistance4&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Recent report has shown that the combination of LAM plus ADV did not suppress HBV DNA&#xD;
           effectively in CHB patients with resistance mutations to both drugs. Only 12.2% of these&#xD;
           pts achieved virologic response(VR; HBV DNA &lt;60 IU/mL) at 12 months and multivariable&#xD;
           analysis showed that LAM+ADV group and the presence of the rtA181V/T mutation were&#xD;
           independently associated with a decreased rate of virologic response (HBV DNA &lt;2,000&#xD;
           IU/ml) at 12 months4&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. ETV has been demonstrated to be effective in patients with ADV resistance but not in&#xD;
           patients with proven YMDD mutation. In contrast, TDF has been shown to be effective in&#xD;
           patients with YMDD mutation but not necessarily in all patients with ADV resistance.1-3&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Thus theoretically, the combination of the most potent nucleoside analogue and&#xD;
           nucleotide analogue with non-overlapping resistance profiles, such as ETV plus TDF, is&#xD;
           expected to be a promising salvage treatment for multidrug resistant HBV but clinical&#xD;
           evidence is limited&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Therefore, this study will explore that adequate management of multidrug resistant&#xD;
           patients using ETV plus TDF combination may lead to faster and greater viral suppression&#xD;
           and prevent further emergence of antiviral resistance&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will orally take investigational drugs once daily for 48 weeks. All subjects&#xD;
      will be assessed at baseline, Week 4, 12, 24, 36 and 48. Evaluations at each visit will&#xD;
      include vital signs, physical examinations, laboratory tests and HBV DNA levels. They were&#xD;
      also questioned about adverse events and concomitant medications. At baseline and every six&#xD;
      months thereafter, serum will be assayed for HBV serology. Genotypic analysis will be&#xD;
      performed at baseline and 48 weeks.&#xD;
