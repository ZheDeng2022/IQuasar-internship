  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential effect of bardoxolone methyl on the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of digoxin and rosuvastatin and to assess the safety of the concomitant&#xD;
      administration of bardoxolone methyl with digoxin or rosuvastatin.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects in Cohort 1 will receive a single dose of digoxin (0.5 mg) on Study Day 1, an&#xD;
      initial dose of bardoxolone methyl (60 mg) and a single dose of digoxin (0.5 mg) on Study Day&#xD;
      10, and once daily doses of bardoxolone methyl (20 mg) on Study Days 11 through 14. Subjects&#xD;
      in Cohort 2 will receive a single dose of rosuvastatin (20 mg) on Study Day 1, an initial&#xD;
      dose of bardoxolone methyl (60 mg) and a single dose of rosuvastatin (20 mg) on Study Day 10,&#xD;
      and once daily doses of bardoxolone methyl (20 mg) on Study Days 11 through 14. All doses&#xD;
      will be given in the morning under fasting conditions. Bardoxolone methyl and the probe&#xD;
      substrates (digoxin, rosuvastatin) will be dosed at the same time. Confinement will begin on&#xD;
      Study Day -1 (Study Day before the first dosing day) and end after the collection of the 216&#xD;
      hour blood samples and scheduled study procedures on Study Day 19.&#xD;
