      This study investigates the response of vaginal and cervical tissue after exposure to three&#xD;
      vaginal products: hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC) placebo, nonoxynol-9 (N9) and imiquimod (IMQ)&#xD;
      cream.&#xD;

      Each woman in this study will be evaluated 5 separate times:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Baseline in the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Baseline in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. After a 3 day (4 dose) treatment with HEC placebo;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. After a 3 day (4 dose) treatment of 4% N-9;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. After a 2 day (2 dose) treatment of IMQ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subset of 5 women will have an additional baseline visit in the follicular phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The order of the N-9 and IMQ treatments is randomized. The study is cross over in design. The&#xD;
      per sequence of treatments is as follows: Baseline in the follicular phase of the menstrual&#xD;
      cycle, next is baseline in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, next is after a 3 day (4&#xD;
      dose) treatment with HEC placebo. At this point in the study, half of the participants are&#xD;
      randomized to do the N-9 treatment and then the IMQ treatment. The remaining half of the&#xD;
      participants do the IMQ treatment and then the N-9 treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants are sampled at the 5 timepoints described above.&#xD;
