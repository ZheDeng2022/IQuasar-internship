  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand the effectiveness of a ten-week internet-based&#xD;
      cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) treatment on improving depressive symptoms, coping and&#xD;
      resilience skills, and cognitive processing.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The need for mental health services is high among military personnel but perceived stigma and&#xD;
      other barriers prevent many Soldiers from obtaining the help they need. Alternative mental&#xD;
      health treatment approaches that mitigate stigma and increase access and compliance are&#xD;
      greatly needed. One promising treatment approach that has shown efficacy in preliminary&#xD;
      research and which may address issues related to stigma and barriers to care, is&#xD;
      internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT). Internet-based treatments offer brief,&#xD;
      interactive, and structured treatment approaches that can be completed by individuals&#xD;
      relatively anonymously, in the convenience and privacy of their own homes, and according to&#xD;
      their own schedules. Such interventions could offer Soldiers an alternative treatment method&#xD;
      that minimizes stigma by allowing private and quasi-anonymous access to treatment and which&#xD;
      minimizes barriers to care by enhancing access and maximizing schedule flexibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emerging evidence suggests that iCBT is a particularly promising and well-accepted approach&#xD;
      for treating large numbers of individuals while minimizing cost and clinicians' time demand.&#xD;
      The study of internet-based and other computer-assisted therapies is currently in its infancy&#xD;
      and most studies still lack sufficient methodological rigor to firmly establish the efficacy&#xD;
      and applicability of these approaches. The proposed project will provide the most&#xD;
      comprehensive evaluation of iCBT to date by employing functional neuroimaging techniques,&#xD;
      neurocognitive testing of implicit negative biases and responses to negative feedback, and&#xD;
      assessment of resilience and coping capacities in addition to standard symptom-based outcome&#xD;
      measures.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Pre-treatment to Post-treatment (10 Weeks), Measured by the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, 17 Item Version (HRSD-17).</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at the baseline visit and 10 weeks after the baseline visit</time_frame>
    <description>To assess change in severity of depression symptoms. The total score is reported, which is the sum of the ratings of all items and ranges from 0 to 52, with higher scores indicating a worse outcome or greater severity of depression symptoms.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Weekly Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline visit, and 10 weeks after baseline visit</time_frame>
    <description>Participants' scores on the PHQ-9 will be measured at baseline before treatment, each week during the treatment, and again at 10 weeks post-treatment. The range of possible scores on the PHQ-9 is 0 to 27 and higher scores indicate worse outcome or more severe depression</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Weekly Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K-10) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 10 score</time_frame>
    <description>The K-10 is a 10-item self-report measure of psychological distress. Items are scored on a scale from 1&quot; (&quot;none of the time&quot;) to &quot;5&quot; (&quot;all of the time&quot;). Total K-10 scores range from 10 to 50, with higher scores reflecting worse outcome or higher distress.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Improvement From Baseline in Brain Functioning on the Emotional Interference Task (EIT) and the Monetary Incentive Delay Task (MID)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>At 10 weeks (post-treatment), we will look for improvement from baseline in key brain regions known to be affected by depression. Differences in EIT and MID task-related brain responses will be measured.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline visit and 10 weeks after baseline visit</time_frame>
    <description>Participants' scores on the PANAS will be measured at baseline before treatment, and again at 10 weeks post-treatment. Two scores can be derived. 1) A positive affect score can range from 10 to 50, with higher scores representing better outcome or higher levels of positive affect; 2) Negative Affect score can range from 10 to 50, with higher scores representing better outcome or lower levels of negative affect.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Connor Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline visit, and 10 weeks after baseline visit</time_frame>
    <description>Participants' scores on the CD-RISC will be measured at baseline before treatment, and again at 10 weeks post-treatment. Total scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating a better outcome or higher resilience</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Modified Erikson Flanker Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline visit and 10 weeks after baseline visit.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants' scores on the Modified Erikson Flanker Test will be measured at baseline before treatment, and again at 10 weeks post-treatment. Accuracy scores range from 0 to 1 with higher scores reflecting better outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Implicit Association Test (IAT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline visit, 10 weeks after baseline visit.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants' scores on the IAT will be measured at baseline before treatment, and again at 10 weeks post-treatment. The IAT effect is called the D score with a possible range of -2 to +2, with larger scores reflecting worse outcome and stronger suicidality</description>

          <description>The Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, 17 item (HRSD-17) was the primary outcome measure of depression severity, administered by doctoral-level raters at pre-treatment/baseline and post-treatment. Each item is rated on a 3- or 5- point scale (0-2 or 0-4), and total HRSD scores can range from 0 to 52. There are 17 items (questions) in this scale, each scored on a 3-point or 5-point scale. Higher scores indicate more severe (worse) symptoms. Total scores vary from 0 to 52. Total scores are represented in this report.</description>

The scale presents each of the nine DSM-IV MDD symptoms to be rated on a 4-point frequency scale ranging from &quot;0&quot; (not at all) to &quot;3&quot; (nearly every day). Higher scores indicate more severe (worse) symptoms. Total scores vary from 0 to 27. Total scores are represented in this report.</description>

          <description>The Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10) is a 10-item self-report measure that yields a score of distress based on questions about anxiety and depressive symptoms that the person has experience in the prior 4 week period. The K10 comprises 10 questions that are answered using a five-point scale (where 5 = all of the time, and 1 = none of the time). The total range of scores is 10 to 50.</description>

          <description>The K-10 is a 10-item self-report measure of psychological distress. Items are scored on a scale from 1&quot; (&quot;none of the time&quot;) to &quot;5&quot; (&quot;all of the time&quot;). Total K-10 scores range from 10 to 50, with higher scores reflecting worse outcome or higher distress.</description>
