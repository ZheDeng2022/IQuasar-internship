      The objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the effect of OT compared to placebo, as add-on to anti-psychotics, on&#xD;
           social functioning in schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the effect of socially oriented CBT administered to patients immediately&#xD;
           after they receive OT, compared to patients who receive OT with not-socially oriented&#xD;
           CBT, and compared to patients who receive socially oriented CBT without OT. The&#xD;
           investigators hypothesize that OT and socially oriented CBT will have a synergistic&#xD;
           effect, and will be better than OT or CBT alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Use a detailed, in depth analysis of social interaction to assess these putative effects&#xD;
           of OT. The investigators hypothesize that the use of this analysis will show larger&#xD;
           treatment effects of OT than previously shown in less sensitive assessments, such as&#xD;
           PANSS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To assess the effect of epigenetic status on response to OT. The investigators&#xD;
           hypothesize that epigenetic variants associated with lower OT plasma levels will be&#xD;
           associated with greater response to OT treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To assess in the relationships between levels of salivary OT and vasopressin, and social&#xD;
           interactions in schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To assess in the relationships between levels of salivary OT and vasopressin, and&#xD;
           response to OT treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Social disability is a hallmark of schizophrenia, and improving social functioning in&#xD;
      schizophrenia should improve patients' overall functioning and quality of life. Oxytocin&#xD;
      (Granholm, McQuaid et al.) is a nine amino-acid neuropeptide synthesized in the hypothalamus,&#xD;
      has found to modulate social behaviors in mammals, including humans (Insel and Young 2001;&#xD;
      Kosfeld, Heinrichs et al. 2005). Among its influences on human social behavior are increased&#xD;
      trust (Kosfeld, Heinrichs et al. 2005), empathy (Hurlemann, Patin et al. 2010) and eye&#xD;
      contact (Guastella, Mitchell et al. 2008).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impaired social behaviors are a core domain of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) (Modahl, Green&#xD;
      et al. 1998; Bartz and Hollander 2008); studies have shown that social disabilities have been&#xD;
      associated with OT dysfunction in ASD, and have been improved by administration of intranasal&#xD;
      OT (Hollander, Bartz et al. 2007; Andari, Duhamel et al. 2010; Guastella, Einfeld et al.&#xD;
      2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, epigenetic changes in the genes encoding for OT have been demonstrated in autism&#xD;
      (Gregory, Connelly et al. 2009)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impaired social functioning is a hallmark of schizophrenia; studies show that plasma levels&#xD;
      of endogenous OT are lower in schizophrenia patients compared to controls, and patients with&#xD;
      lower levels of plasma OT have more positive symptoms (Kéri , Kiss et al. 2009; Kיri, Kiss et&#xD;
      al. 2009; Rubin, Carter et al. 2010). Moreover, a recent study demonstrated a significant&#xD;
      genetic association between OT and Arginine Vasopressin, another peptide linked with social&#xD;
      behavior, and schizophrenia (Teltsh, Kanyas-Sarner et al. 2011). Only two published studies&#xD;
      have investigated the therapeutic potential of OT in schizophrenia; both administered OT in&#xD;
      addition to anti-psychotic treatment. Feifel (Feifel, Macdonald et al. 2010) reported a&#xD;
      decrease in positive symptoms after 3 weeks of treatment, and Pedersen (Pedersen, Gibson et&#xD;
      al. 2011) reported an improvement in social cognition. There is ongoing research aiming to&#xD;
      validate these findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vasopressin is also a peptide with a putative effect on social interaction (Ebstein, Israel&#xD;
      et al. 2009; Heinrichs, von Dawans et al. 2009). In this proposed study we will assay&#xD;
      salivary levels both of OT and vasopressin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this proposed study we intend to administer OT in a placebo-controlled, double-blind&#xD;
      design to patients with schizophrenia. In addition to assessing the effect of OT on the&#xD;
      symptoms of schizophrenia, this proposal has four characteristics which we believe are&#xD;
      unique, and we hope will enable a large step forward in understanding the role of OT in&#xD;
      schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Social functioning: will be assessed using previously validated techniques, by&#xD;
           video-taping interviews with schizophrenia patients. The quality of the social&#xD;
           interactions will then be assessed, by raters blinded to treatment status. The&#xD;
           assessment will , specifically focus on the gaze to the experimenter's face,&#xD;
           vocalization (patient's vocal output, positive/negative tone, and fluent speech) and&#xD;
           affect, body tone, movements, and other non-verbal signs. This technique was developed&#xD;
           in Prof. Feldman's lab, and has been show to accurately assess social interactions&#xD;
           (Feldman, Masalha et al. 2001; Feldman and Klein 2003; Feldman and Eidelman 2009;&#xD;
           Feldman 2010). This technique will enable meticulous quantification of the putative&#xD;
           effects of OT on social functioning in schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data from preclinical models of traumatic brain injury (Feeney, Gonzalez et al. 1982)&#xD;
           and clinical studies in stroke patients (Crisostomo, Duncan et al. 1988; Scheidtmann,&#xD;
           Fries et al. 2001; Taub, Uswatte et al. 2002)] suggest that new learning develops&#xD;
           faster, has increased magnitude and is longer lasting under a combined intervention of&#xD;
           drug and practice relative to learning occurring under either intervention in isolation.&#xD;
           Similar thoughts have been expressed regarding compounds which putatively enhance&#xD;
           cognition, in that patients who receive compounds which enhance cognition should be&#xD;
           treated with cognitive remediation at the same time. We propose to apply this concept to&#xD;
           OT. In this proposal, patients will be treated with cognitive-behavioral therapy&#xD;
           (socially oriented CBT) focused on social interactions, emphasizing eye contact, body&#xD;
           language, empathy, etc. Socially oriented CBT will be administered three times/week&#xD;
           during the time period immediately after OT administration, when OT is active. There&#xD;
           will be a control CBT condition addressing medication compliance and vocational&#xD;
           rehabilitation, without any social orientation, with somewhat analogous demand&#xD;
           characteristics. We hypothesize that the combined effects of OT co-administered with&#xD;
           socially oriented CBT will be synergistic, i.e. greater than the effect of either alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The effects of epigenetic variation on the effects of OT treatment will be examined by&#xD;
           assessing epigenetic status of subjects, and these will be correlated with response to&#xD;
           treatment. We will examine the methylation status of two CpG sites (-934 and -924) in&#xD;
           the OXTR promoter. The epigenetic evaluation would detect whether the exogenously&#xD;
           administered OT changes OXTR genes, their expression or function on OT levels and&#xD;
           behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two previous studies have administered 40 international units (IU) X2/d= 80 IU/d&#xD;
           (Feifel, Macdonald et al. 2010) or 24 IU X2/d= 48 IU/d (Pedersen, Gibson et al. 2011),&#xD;
           with no adverse effects. Based on this data, we propose to administer 24 IU X3/d= 72 IU.&#xD;
           This dose is lower than Feifel et al. and no adverse effects were seen. Therefore, we&#xD;
           are sure that thus dose is safe.&#xD;
