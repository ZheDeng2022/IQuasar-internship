  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that a technique called microdialysis can be used to measure&#xD;
      the amount of the drug diclofenac which penetrates (enters) the fatty tissue under the skin.&#xD;
      Microdialysis uses a small device called a 'probe' to determine the amount of drug which&#xD;
      enters a body tissue. The small device is placed directly in the fatty tissue and samples are&#xD;
      taken at specific times. The investigators will determine whether site of application affects&#xD;
      the availability of the drug.&#xD;

    <description>Blood and tissue concentrations (nanograms/milliliter) of the drug diclofenac will be measured and compared between different batches of the product Flector. In addition, the two batches will be compared at different application sites, namely the abdomen and thigh. Tissue concentrations will be measured using microdialysis.</description>

             results of the serum chemistry panel (including liver enzymes, other specific tests)&#xD;
             and hematology are outside the normal reference ranges, the subject may be included&#xD;
             only if the study physician judges the abnormalities or deviations from normal to be&#xD;
             not clinically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subjects must be postmenopausal (for at least 6 months), surgically sterile, or&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subjects should be willing avoid the use of body oils, creams, lotions, or powders to&#xD;

             disorders, hematological disease, bronchospastic respiratory disease, asthma, diabetes&#xD;
             mellitus, renal or hepatic insufficiency, or any other illness that the investigator&#xD;
             considers should exclude the subject.&#xD;

          -  History of atopic eczema, dry skin or ichthyosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Excessive hair at the site of application that could possibly affect drug absorption;&#xD;

             sites, their assessments, and their reaction to drug, or that may compromised the&#xD;
             safety of the subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
