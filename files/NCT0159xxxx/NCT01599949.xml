      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ibrutinib in patients&#xD;
      with mantle cell lymphoma who received at least 1 prior rituximab-containing chemotherapy&#xD;
      regimen and who progressed after bortezomib therapy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm (all patients will receive the study drug) study to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of ibrutinib in patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) who have&#xD;
      received at least 1 rituximab-containing chemotherapy regimen and who progressed after&#xD;
      bortezomib therapy. Approximately 110 eligible patients will be enrolled. During the&#xD;
      treatment phase, patients will receive 560 mg of ibrutinib by mouth once daily continuously&#xD;
      until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or study end, whichever occurs first.&#xD;
      Treatment will be continuous (without interruption) and self-administered at home. Doses can&#xD;
      be held or reduced based on the severity of and the recovery from side effects of the study&#xD;
      drug. The sponsor will ensure that patients benefiting from treatment with ibrutinib will be&#xD;
      able to continue treatment after the end of the study. Data will be collected on disease&#xD;
      response to the treatment, on progression-free survival, overall survival, and subsequent&#xD;
      anti-MCL therapies. Serial pharmacokinetic (study of what the body does to a drug) samples&#xD;
      will be collected as detailed in the protocol. Safety will be monitored throughout the study.&#xD;
      An interim analysis of the pharmacokinetic data will occur approximately 3 months after the&#xD;
      scheduled pharmacokinetic sampling in Cycles 1 and 2 has been completed. Data will be&#xD;
      analyzed 1 year after the last patient is enrolled for the primary analysis and 2 years after&#xD;
      last patient is enrolled for the final follow-up.&#xD;
