    <textblock>
      This is a study in healthy adult subjects to evaluate the bioequivalence of a Combined&#xD;
      Formulated Tablet compared with maraviroc and Combivir administered concurrently versus&#xD;
      maraviroc + Combivir. 42 subjects will be enrolled in the study such that 40 subjects&#xD;
      complete dosing and critical assessments. The total duration of a subject's participation&#xD;
      will be approximately 33 to 35 days, including a screening period (Day -21 to Day -1), 2&#xD;
      treatment periods (Days 1-3), at least a 7-day washout between Period 1 and Period 2, and a&#xD;
      follow-up visit 7 to 14 days after the last dose of study drug in Period 2. Each dosing&#xD;
      period will begin the evening prior to dosing and extend until 48 hours (Day 3) after dosing.&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomly assigned to receive 1 of the following 2 treatments in Period 1&#xD;
      then crossover to receive the alternate treatment in Period 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Sequence 1 (N=21) subjects will receive Treatment A followed by a 7 day washout and&#xD;
      Treatment B. In Sequence 2 (N=21) subjects will receive Treatment B followed by a 7 day&#xD;
      washout and Treatment A. Treatment A consists of 1 tablet of maraviroc 300 mg, lamivudine 150&#xD;
      mg, and zidovudine 300 mg as a combined formulation after an overnight fast. Treatment B&#xD;
      consists of 1 tablet of maraviroc 300 mg + 1 tablet of Combivir taken concurrently after an&#xD;
      overnight fast. On Day 1 of each treatment period, subjects will receive study drug in the&#xD;
      morning after an overnight fast of at least 8 hours. Study drug will be administered with 240&#xD;
      mL of water. Dosing in each treatment period will be separated by a minimum washout period of&#xD;
      at least 7 days between doses. All subjects will undergo safety and other assessments.&#xD;
      Subjects may be discharged after all study procedures are completed on the morning of Day 3,&#xD;
      with instructions to return for the next study period or the follow-up visit, as appropriate.&#xD;
      The follow-up visit will occur 7 to 14 days after the last dose of study drug in Period 2.&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetic blood samples will be collected during each treatment period for evaluation&#xD;
      of maraviroc, lamivudine, and zidovudine before dosing and at 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 3,&#xD;
      4, 6, 8, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 48 hours after dosing (total of 16 PK time points per treatment&#xD;
      period). Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed, with the exception of immediate&#xD;
      safety concerns. Therefore, adherence to the study protocol requirements, including those&#xD;
      specified in the Time and Events Table, are essential and required for study conduct.&#xD;

             medical history, vital sign measurements, physical examination, clinical laboratory&#xD;
             tests, and 12-lead ECG. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters&#xD;
             outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if&#xD;
             the investigator and the Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to&#xD;
             introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of: Non childbearing potential,&#xD;
             defined as premenopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or&#xD;
             postmenopausal, defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea (in questionable cases,&#xD;
             a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone [FSH] greater than 40&#xD;
             MlU/mL and estradiol less than 40 pg/mL (less than 146.8 pmol/L) is confirmatory).&#xD;
             Childbearing potential and is abstinent (abstinence from penile-vaginal intercourse&#xD;
             must be consistent with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject) or agrees to&#xD;
             use 1 of the contraception methods listed in Section 8.1 for an appropriate period of&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  The subject has alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin less&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational&#xD;
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current&#xD;
             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives, or twice the duration of the biological effect of the&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  The subject has a history of sensitivity to any of the study drugs, or components&#xD;
