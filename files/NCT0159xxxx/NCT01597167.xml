  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a 1-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, trial to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy of an IV infusion of magnesium sulfate on symptoms of treatment&#xD;
      resistant mild and moderate depression in 20 males and females (21-70 years of age).&#xD;
      Participants will be assessed at screening/baseline, day 1, day 2, day 7, and day 8. Each&#xD;
      subject will be randomized in a double-blind fashion to receive either IV infusion of&#xD;
      magnesium sulfate or 5% dextrose followed by a washout period of 5 days then crossover to&#xD;
      receive either IV infusion of 5% dextrose or magnesium sulfate.&#xD;

      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the magnesium deficient status in treatment-resistant mild and moderate&#xD;
           depression patients via 24-hour urine magnesium assessment before and after IV magnesium&#xD;
           infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Correlation of intracellular magnesium (EXATEST), urine magnesium, and serum magnesium&#xD;
           as well as sensitivity to the IV magnesium infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess the effectiveness of magnesium sulfate infusion on treatment resistant mild&#xD;
           and moderate depression patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate the magnesium deficient status in treatment-resistant mild and moderate&#xD;
           depression patients via assay of 24-hour urine magnesium, blood magnesium, and EXATEST&#xD;
           of intracellular magnesium of epithelial cells before and after IV infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the effectiveness of the magnesium sulfate infusion on the mean change in&#xD;
           scores on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and the Patient Health Questionnaire&#xD;
           (PHQ-9) for depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To correlate the levels of magnesium with the scores on the Hamilton Rating Scale for&#xD;
      Depression and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) for depression.&#xD;
