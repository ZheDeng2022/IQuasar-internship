  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Avulsion fractures of the base (tuberosity) of fifth metatarsal bone are the most common&#xD;
      fractures in the foot, frequently treated in fracture clinics and involving significant&#xD;
      resources. At present methods of treatment and follow up vary widely from no active treatment&#xD;
      to surgery, depending entirely on a treating doctor preference. There is no agreement on&#xD;
      simple, safe and reliable method of treatment. The investigators believe that vast majority&#xD;
      of these injuries heal well on its own without any specific treatment. By comparing two most&#xD;
      commonly used treatments the investigators aim to establish one simple, safe and reliable&#xD;
      mode of treatments. The investigators are going to evaluate functional results of these two&#xD;
      treatments in a short and longer time prospective, by using the best available scientific&#xD;
      tools. The investigators believe that results of the investigators study will eventually lead&#xD;
      to change of practise and more efficient NHS care for these patients. It will reduce&#xD;
      unnecessary treatments and clinic appointments, and bring substantial savings to the NHS in a&#xD;
      long prospective.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised prospective control trial. Patients with these fractures will normally&#xD;
      first come to the Emergency Department (ED), where they have a foot radiograph confirming a&#xD;
      fracture, and initial treatment only. This treatment is arbitrary, depends on the assessing&#xD;
      clinician preference and usually varies from supportive tight bandage or a supportive plaster&#xD;
      cast with crutches. All of these patients are normally referred to an orthopaedic fracture&#xD;
      clinic. It is an orthopaedic trauma clinician in the fracture clinic who determines and takes&#xD;
      the responsibility for the definitive management of patients with this injuries and may&#xD;
      decide to change the treatment initiated by the ED staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will inform clinical staff in the ED of the trial.The investigators will&#xD;
      provide ED clinicians with patient information sheets. Patients who have this information&#xD;
      sheet provided by the ED will have between a few hours and more than 24 hours &quot;cool off&quot;&#xD;
      period to consider the information depending on next fracture clinic availability. Then they&#xD;
      will be recruited in the fracture clinic should they wish to participate. The investigators&#xD;
      must stress, however, that due to the nature of the ED service - high staff turn around, time&#xD;
      pressure and other reasons beyond our control it is not possible to guarantee that all&#xD;
      patients with relevant injuries will receive an information sheet in ED and have this &quot;cool&#xD;
      off&quot; period to consider participation in. In such situations patients will be offered the&#xD;
      information sheet, counselled and recruited, if they wish to, on their first presentation to&#xD;
      the fracture clinic. The investigators believe that due to practical issues related to ED&#xD;
      service this will be the likely situation for a significant proportion of patients. The&#xD;
      investigators think this is an unavoidable situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited on their first presentation to a fracture clinic should they&#xD;
      consent. Using centralised electronic remote randomisation method patients will be allocated&#xD;
      either to group A(symptomatic treatment)- double tubigrip and crutches with recommendation to&#xD;
      weight bear as comfortable in normal footwear, or group B (active treatment) - below knee&#xD;
      walking plaster cast with crutches and recommendation to weight bear as comfortable. This&#xD;
      means that for many patients the initial treatment they received in ED will be changed but&#xD;
      this often happens in normal current practice. Two treatment modes used in our study -&#xD;
      supportive bandage and walking cast are the ones most commonly used normally. Patients&#xD;
      declining to participate in the study will be treated and followed up according to patient&#xD;
      and treating clinician preference and this also reflects the current practice. This study&#xD;
      therefore deviates little from the current common practice. Patients in group B will be&#xD;
      evaluated for venous thrombo-embolism (VTE) risk according to Sheffield Teaching Hospitals&#xD;
      NHS Foundation Trust policy. Those whose risk is high will be offered anti-thrombotic&#xD;
      prophylaxis according to the Trust policy for the duration of cast immobilization (4 weeks).&#xD;
      Those patients will be counselled on benefits and risks of anti-thrombotic prophylaxis. On&#xD;
      the whole we do not anticipate many patients to require anti-thrombotic prophylaxis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: Primary outcome - foot functional outcome. We will use a Visual&#xD;
      -Analogue-Scale Foot and Ankle (VAS FA) score. This is the only validated functional foot and&#xD;
      ankle score. Secondary outcome - A) Health status and functional outcome, - Euroqol (EQ- 5D)&#xD;
      - a standardised instrument for use as a measure of a health outcome and B) - foot function -&#xD;
      American Foot and Ankle Society Foot and Ankle functional (AOFAS) score. This foot and ankle&#xD;
      score is not validated, but most frequently used in the research literature. Additional&#xD;
      outcomes will be records of unexpected return with the same problem, change of treatment&#xD;
      modality, re-injury of the same foot and complications of treatment. The investigators will&#xD;
      evaluate outcomes at four time points. Firstly, patients will complete baseline VAS FA,&#xD;
      AOFAS, and EQ-5D questinnaires providing the level of functional impairment/disability prior&#xD;
      to treatment. Patients in both groups will be seen in clinic at 4 weeks - at this stage cast&#xD;
      will be removed in group B. At this point VAS FA, AOFAS, and EQ-5D questionnaires will be&#xD;
      filled by patients in both groups in clinic. To see whether method of treatment has an effect&#xD;
      in longer prospective the investigators will evaluate outcomes at 3 and 6 months. We&#xD;
      anticipate that by this time fractures will heal uneventfully in the vast majority of&#xD;
      patients . We believe that majority of patients is unlikely to return to clinic after such a&#xD;
      long time. For this reason the investigators will post questionnaires to patients in both&#xD;
      groups to be filled at home and posted back to us in confidential prepaid envelopes one week&#xD;
      before their respective 3 and 6 month follow up. If a patient will decide to withdraw, or we&#xD;
      have no response, - no further attempts to contact will be made. The investigators believe&#xD;
      that this will save unnecessary follow up appointments, and also yield more results. In case&#xD;
      of any problems all patients will be able to return to a fracture clinic for a help. The&#xD;
      investigators will ask all patients in both groups to stop using crutches whenever they feel&#xD;
      like to.&#xD;
