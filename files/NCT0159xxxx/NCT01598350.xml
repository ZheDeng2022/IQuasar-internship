    <textblock>
      On average, Down syndrome (DS) occurs once in every 700 live births and results in life-long&#xD;
      disability and increased risk for comorbidities.1 Individuals with DS are also susceptible to&#xD;
      secondary physical impairments and limitations as a result of complications associated with&#xD;
      joint hypermobility, hypotonicity, and increased ligamentous laxity. Secondary impairments&#xD;
      such as pes planus (flat feet), weakened muscles, bony abnormalities and arthritis may lead&#xD;
      to painful joints and feet. Additionally, children with DS often manifest deviations in gait&#xD;
      as a result of physical limitations imposed by orthopedic and muscular deficiencies that may&#xD;
      lead to decreased postural stability. These secondary losses in function, which exacerbate&#xD;
      disabilities, may be preventable with the use of appropriate early interventions aimed at&#xD;
      correcting abnormal joint alignment. Research exploring effective physical therapy&#xD;
      interventions for adults and children with DS is currently very limited. However, the use of&#xD;
      orthotic devices to support lax ligaments and hypotonic muscles, which are common&#xD;
      manifestations of DS, is one accepted method of intervention for children within this&#xD;
      population. Orthoses are variable in structure and the degree of support provided to the foot&#xD;
      and ankle also differ between foot orthoses (FOs) and supramalleolar orthoses (SMOs).&#xD;
      Previous studies have supported the effectiveness of orthoses on improving ankle and foot&#xD;
      alignment, as well as gait parameters. However, disagreement currently exists concerning&#xD;
      which type of orthotic device is most beneficial for the population of children with DS.&#xD;
      Children with DS express variable degrees of joint laxity and hypotonicity, as well as&#xD;
      differences in the severity of specific alignment abnormalities such as excessive pronation&#xD;
      or calcaneal eversion.6 Current literature is insufficient for explaining differences in the&#xD;
      benefits provided by FOs and SMOs and the specific indications for their use in children with&#xD;
      DS is unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Aims This study will demonstrate the differences in structural outcomes provided by FOs&#xD;
      and SMOs and develop specific criterion for matching individuals of differing orthopedic&#xD;
      impairments with the most beneficial orthotic device.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the differences in functional outcomes provided&#xD;
      by supramalleolar orthoses and foot orthoses, as well as develop specific criterion for&#xD;
      matching individuals with Down syndrome (DS) of differing orthopedic impairments with the&#xD;
      most beneficial orthotic device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants must be able to walk independently or with an assistive device, such as a&#xD;
      walker, for 50 feet at one time, and have at least six months of walking experience.&#xD;
      Participants must also be able to follow simple verbal instructions. Both males and females&#xD;
      will be included in this study, and children of any race may participate as long as they meet&#xD;
      the inclusion criteria and are between three and ten years of age at the time of data&#xD;
      collection. Exclusion criteria include a history of uncorrected visual and inner ear&#xD;
      impairments, and lower extremity orthopedic surgical corrections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no costs associated with participation in this study, and subjects will not be paid&#xD;
      for their participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this study will be fitted for the appropriate size orthoses either by&#xD;
      physical therapists in the participants' school district, or by one of the researchers prior&#xD;
      to data collection. The correct fitting orthotic will be sized using the sizing guides&#xD;
      provided by Cascade. These are footplates of various sizes that provide the length of the&#xD;
      child's foot in inches and the orthosis width that will fit the child. Measurements of&#xD;
      height, weight, leg length, medial longitudinal arch height, tibial torsion, and calcaneal&#xD;
      eversion will be taken for each subject. Weight will be measured in kilograms using a scale,&#xD;
      while height, leg length, and medial longitudinal arch height will be measured using a metric&#xD;
      tape measure. Tibial torsion will be measured with the participant lying in prone (on their&#xD;
      stomach) on the plinth with one knee flexed to 90 degrees. The angle of tibial torsion is&#xD;
      formed by a line perpendicular to the line between the medial and lateral malleoli of the&#xD;
      ankle, and a line parallel to the femur. This angle will be measured using a goniometer,&#xD;
      which is an instrument used to measure joint angles and range of motion, and this angle will&#xD;
      be measured once on each side. Finally, while standing, calcaneal eversion will be measured&#xD;
      by determining the angle between neutral calcaneal alignment and resting stance. Neutral&#xD;
      calcaneal alignment is found by palpating the position of the talus, so that the talus bone&#xD;
      is felt equally on both sides of the foot. Once neutral alignment has been determined a line&#xD;
      will be drawn with washable marker between the posterior talus and midline of the calf. The&#xD;
      participant will then be asked to stand in their normal position and a goniometer will be&#xD;
      used to measure the angle between the neutral alignment and the resting alignment of the&#xD;
      ankle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to these measurements, a hypermobility screen will be performed in which mobility&#xD;
      of fingers, wrists, elbows, knees, and the spine will be scored. The screen is scored using a&#xD;
      point system in which one point is given for the ability to perform each of the tasks in the&#xD;
      screen. These tasks include the ability to actively extend the little fingers 90 degrees at&#xD;
      the metacarpophalangeal joints, passively touch the thumbs to the volar surface of the&#xD;
      forearms, extend the wrists more than 90 degrees, extend elbows and knees more than 10&#xD;
      degrees, and the ability to bend the spine to reach the floor with palms flat on the ground.&#xD;
      Gait of each participant will be assessed in conditions of shoes only, with foot orthoses,&#xD;
      and with supramalleolar orthoses. This order will be determined by selecting a condition at&#xD;
      random from a hat, such that the first condition chosen will be performed and assessed first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gait parameters including step length, step width, walking speed, percentage of time spent in&#xD;
      single leg support, and variability in gait will be measured using a GAITRite mat. The&#xD;
      GAITRite measurement system includes an electronic walkway which contains sensor pads, and is&#xD;
      similar to a roll-out carpet. The GAITRite mat is then linked to a computer, which collects&#xD;
      information about gait as the participant walks across the mat. The GAITRite mat, which is 20&#xD;
      feet long, will be set-up as one segment of a circular track so that total walking distance&#xD;
      of the loop will be 50 feet. Participants will be given an accommodation period of ten&#xD;
      minutes for both types of orthoses prior to gait assessment in which they will be instructed&#xD;
      to walk around the room and over the GAITRite mat in order to get comfortable wearing the&#xD;
      orthoses and walking along the track. Once the accommodation period is complete for one&#xD;
      orthosis, participants will walk around the track three times. This procedure of&#xD;
      accommodation and data collection will be repeated for each condition. Participants will be&#xD;
      given verbal encouragement by the researchers as they walk the track as a means of&#xD;
      motivation. Rest periods will be given to participants when requested, or when behavioral&#xD;
      cues displaying discomfort, pain, or frustration occur. Data collection will be stopped&#xD;
      altogether at the participant's request or if behavioral cues of discomfort persist. Trials&#xD;
      involving both supramalleolar and foot orthoses are hypothesized to increase step length,&#xD;
      walking speed, and time spent in single leg support from control trials in the shoes only&#xD;
      condition. Both orthoses are also expected to decrease step width, and variability in gait&#xD;
      parameters. Supramalleolar orthoses, which provide above-ankle support, are expected to&#xD;
      improve gait parameters to a greater magnitude than foot orthoses for participants who score&#xD;
      higher on the hypermobility screen and have greater tibial torsion and ankle eversion than&#xD;
      their cohorts. Conversely, foot orthoses are expected to provide greater improvement in gait&#xD;
      parameters than supramalleolar orthoses for participants who score lower on the hypermobility&#xD;
      screen and have less tibial torsion and ankle eversion than their cohorts due to the need for&#xD;
      less external foot and ankle support. An increase in step length, walking speed, time spent&#xD;
      in single leg support, and a decrease in step width and variability in gait will indicate a&#xD;
      positive result of orthoses use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Students of physical therapy from the University of Puget Sound Physical Therapy Program will&#xD;
      perform all measurements, with the exception of orthotic size in some cases. One researcher&#xD;
      will perform all anthropometric measurements and the hypermobility screen on the&#xD;
      participants. A second researcher will operate the GAITRite mat, while the third researcher&#xD;
      will guide and instruct the participants along the GAITRite mat course.&#xD;
