  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Modern anti-cancer treatments are focused on development of molecular based therapies i.e.&#xD;
      specific treatments targeted against underlying biological processes. There is still much to&#xD;
      learn about the biology of cancer, especially in tumours such as colorectal and lung cancer&#xD;
      where it is likely multiple heterogenous signaling pathways are responsible for progression&#xD;
      of disease. This project aims to evaluate circulating tumour cells (CTCs) as a surrogate&#xD;
      biomarker for tumour characteristics and to determine how they may used to identify new&#xD;
      targets for therapeutic agents. Their use could be applied to diagnosis of cancer, prediction&#xD;
      of response to therapies and prognosis, ultimately across a broad range of tumour types.&#xD;
      Currently the only way to investigate molecular features of a cancer is through procurement&#xD;
      of an invasive tumour biopsy that is often difficult to obtain, often results in insufficient&#xD;
      material and is unpleasant for the patient. A blood-based test would provide a much more&#xD;
      practical and patient friendly alternative. The enumeration and molecular characterisation of&#xD;
      CTCs has the novel potential of being a &quot;virtual biopsy&quot; of the tumour and offers the&#xD;
      opportunity for immediate therapeutic decisions (eg. if the tumour develops a therapy&#xD;
      resistant genotype while on treatment). CTCs have been known to circulate in bloodstream of&#xD;
      cancer patients for many years and are known to lead to cancer metastases. They have been&#xD;
      very difficult to detect, up until recently, due to the complexity of the metastatic process&#xD;
      and detecting relatively small numbers of CTCs amongst billions of red and white blood cells.&#xD;
      However, technology has moved on dramatically in the last few years. The FDA approved&#xD;
      CellSearch platform (Veridex, NJ) can isolate and enumerate CTCs based on the immunomagnetic&#xD;
      capture of EpCAM (epithelial cell adhesion molecule) positive cells. Several studies have&#xD;
      recently demonstrated the value of CTC enumeration in reflecting prognosis and predicting&#xD;
      early response to systemic chemotherapy. For example, in a study comprising 456 patients with&#xD;
      metastatic colorectal cancer starting a new line of therapy, patients with =3 CTCs per 7.5 ml&#xD;
      blood at baseline had shorter progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS)&#xD;
      compared to those patients with &lt; 3CTCs at baseline (PFS 4.5 versus 7.9 months P=0.0001; OS&#xD;
      8.5 versus 19.1 months P=0.0000 respectively). Overall survival for patients converting to or&#xD;
      maintaining CTCs =3 within a few weeks of commencing systemic therapy remained worse than for&#xD;
      those patients maintaining CTC counts &lt; 3 per 7.5ml blood. Similar results have been reported&#xD;
      in patients with breast and hormone refractory prostate cancer (HRPC). These studies have led&#xD;
      to FDA approval of the CellSearch system as an adjunct to monitoring patients with these 3&#xD;
      tumour types. The CellSearch platform, however, does not allow for the downstream DNA&#xD;
      analysis of captured cells and the ferroparticle-coated CTCs are non-viable. Furthermore,&#xD;
      this platform is a multi-machine, multi-kit system that is laborious (typical 3-7 days&#xD;
      turnover time), expensive (USD 650), and subject to operator variance. In this protocol, the&#xD;
      investigators propose for the first time, an automated, fully quantitative system for&#xD;
      isolation and enrichment of CTCs. The key differentiating feature of our novel CMOS system is&#xD;
      the electrochemical identification and counting of tumour cells using a high density&#xD;
      electrode array with associated electronics for addressing the electrodes. This leads to a&#xD;
      standardized assay for tumour cells with a shorter turnover time and without the need of a&#xD;
      skilled operator. This system also holds the potential for allowing the molecular&#xD;
      characterization of CTCs. This study aims to enumerate CTCs using a novel CMOS technology in&#xD;
      patients with metastatic cancer who are scheduled to receive palliative chemotherapy, and to&#xD;
      correlate CTC number with clinical outcome. In Part I of the study, the investigators will&#xD;
      recruit 10 patients with metastatic NSCLC and 10 patients with metastatic CRC in order to&#xD;
      assess the feasibility of CTC enumeration in patients. In particular, the investigators aim&#xD;
      to establish whether CTCs are detectable using the novel CMOS technology in patients with&#xD;
      metastatic cancer. In Part II of the study, the investigators will recruit 21 patients with&#xD;
      metastatic NSCLC and 89 patients with metastatic CRC in order to compare CTC counts as&#xD;
      determined by the CMOS technology with CTC counts as determined by the CellSearch platform.&#xD;
      Blood samples will be collected at a single time point prior to the start of palliative&#xD;
      chemotherapy. CTC numbers will be correlated with clinical outcome in all evaluable patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that CTC enumeration by a novel CMOS technology is non-inferior&#xD;
      to CTC enumeration by the CellSearch platform in patients with advanced solid malignancies.&#xD;
