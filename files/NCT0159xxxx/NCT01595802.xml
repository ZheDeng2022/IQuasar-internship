      The purpose of the study is to determine the sensitivity, specificity and predictive values&#xD;
      of the Jan Medical NeuroWave System in detecting moderate and severe vasospasm in comparison&#xD;
      to Trans Cranial Doppler(TCD).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral vasospasm generally occurs due to a ruptured brain aneurysm, or (very rarely)&#xD;
      hemorrhage from another blood vessel abnormality such as an arteriovenous malformation (AVM).&#xD;
      The common factor is the abnormal presence of a substantial amount of blood on the outer&#xD;
      (&quot;subarachnoid&quot; or &quot;adventitial&quot;) surface of the blood vessel. This can particularly affect&#xD;
      arteries at the base of the brain, i.e., around the Circle of Willis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depending on the severity, this can be seen using conventional angiography. Angiographic&#xD;
      spasm tends to be most readily detected at about 5-7 days after the SAH, although it may be&#xD;
      detected as early as 3 days after the hemorrhage. It occurs in between half to two-thirds of&#xD;
      all aneurysm patients depending on the time at which angiography was carried out. Clinical&#xD;
      vasospasm occurs in approximately one-third of all patients suffering aneurysmal SAH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The essential problem with vasospasm is that it causes an artery to reduce blood flow or&#xD;
      completely shut down. As a result, the part of the brain formerly supplied by that artery&#xD;
      effectively starves (ischemia) and may die (infarction or stroke). Overall, cerebral&#xD;
      vasospasm accounts for approximately 20% of the severe disability and death associated with&#xD;
      ruptured aneurysms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If vasospasm is detected early, a patient can be treated with balloon angioplasty to reopen&#xD;
      the vessels or have infusions of a vasodilator administered (typically verapamil or&#xD;
      nicardipine). Alternatively, or in concert with that treatment, one can administer&#xD;
      intravenous drugs that raise the patient's blood pressure (&quot;pressors&quot;) to force more blood&#xD;
      through the narrow arteries. Both of these treatments carry risk and therefore should not be&#xD;
      administered unless vasospasm is detected. Therefore, in order to prevent this form of brain&#xD;
      injury and enhance the likelihood that a patient will do better, one needs to detect&#xD;
      vasospasm before it becomes severe enough to injure the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vasospasm can be detected by the signs observed on physical examination of the patient and by&#xD;
      radiological methods such as cerebral angiography, and Trans-Cranial Doppler (TCD)&#xD;
      ultrasound. The physical exam is sensitive for vasospasm in patients who are otherwise awake&#xD;
      and able to participate in a neurological examination. Many patients with subarachnoid&#xD;
      hemorrhage are not keenly aware nor participative to make this clinical exam meaningful.&#xD;
      Therefore clinical examination alone lacks sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gold standard method for detecting vasospasm is cerebral angiography. This involves&#xD;
      injection of a radiopaque dye into the arterial blood stream of a patient and when the dye&#xD;
      reaches the brain X-rays are taken. Although this is the gold-standard for diagnosing&#xD;
      vasospasm it carries the risk of arterial injury or even stroke, and the expense is high. In&#xD;
      addition the contrast dye used in these studies carries the risk of renal failure. As a&#xD;
      result, this technology is generally employed once vasosapasm is suspected from a Trans&#xD;
      Cranial Doppler (TCD) study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TCD is a bedside test that relies on ultrasound waves generated from a probe placed on the&#xD;
      skin of the head and/or neck region to detect the flow of blood in a cerebral artery. It is a&#xD;
      convenient, safe, and frequently effective method that can be used to rapidly confirm the&#xD;
      clinical findings, and is much less invasive than cerebral angiography. It has, however,&#xD;
      numerous technical limitations; for example, one can only detect vasospasm in the proximal&#xD;
      vessels of the circle of Willis and therefore lacks sensitivity. It is also quite operator&#xD;
      dependent and limited to patients with appropriate skull thickness and acoustic windows.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What is needed is a non-invasive, user independent, safe method to detect cerebral vasospasm&#xD;
      before it causes brain injury. The technology needs to be simple to use and can be done at&#xD;
      the bedside in an ICU environment. Such a tool will likely improve patient outcome by&#xD;
      initiating a chain of events that can mitigate vasospasm (cerebral angioplasty or initiation&#xD;
      of vasopressor therapy) and will likely shorten the length of stay within the Neuro ICU&#xD;
      saving hospitals money.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Jan Medical NeuroWave is a simple, rapid, non invasive aid to the diagnosis of vasospasm&#xD;
      that is not operator dependent nor limited by skull structure. This study will determine the&#xD;
      sensitivity, specificity and predictive values of the Jan Medical NeuroWave System in&#xD;
      detecting moderate and severe vasospasm in comparison to Trans Cranial Doppler (TCD).&#xD;
