      The main purposes of this study are: (1) to investigate the difference of the physical&#xD;
      fitness, and quality of life (QOL) among different physical activity levels in post-coronary&#xD;
      artery bypass graft (CABG) patients; (2) to analyze the relationships between physical&#xD;
      activity and physical fitness and QOL in this population. The investigators predict physical&#xD;
      activity and physical fitness remain limited in patients after CABG, and patients with higher&#xD;
      physical activity levels will have higher QOL and physical fitness.&#xD;

      Heart diseases continue as the top 3 causes of death in Taiwan in recent ten years. Coronary&#xD;
      artery disease (CAD) is the most prevalent fatal heart disease. Coronary artery bypass graft&#xD;
      surgery (CABG) is now one of the most common procedures to treat CAD. It was reported that&#xD;
      CABG intervention could prolong the life. However, outcomes of CABG have historically been&#xD;
      measured in terms of mortality and recurrence of symptoms or complications.There is ample&#xD;
      evidence to demonstrate the effect and benefit of cardiac rehabilitation in QOL and function&#xD;
      activity in patients post CABG. However, the participation rate of postoperative cardiac&#xD;
      rehabilitation is low, especially in women.Little research has been done to examine the&#xD;
      physical activity, physical performance, and QOL in this population outside the cardiac&#xD;
      rehabilitation setting.&#xD;

    <description>The level of physical activity was evaluated by the self-administrated long form of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire, which was permitted by the Bureau of Health Promotion, Department of Health, R.O.C.(Taiwan). It is an instrument that estimates the weekly time spent on the performance of physical activities according to intensity, in different contexts of life (workplace, household tasks, transport and leisure). Reported minutes per week in each category were weighted by a metabolic equivalent (MET; multiples of resting energy expenditure).</description>

    <description>QOL was measured using abbreviated version of the World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL-BREF) questionnaire. The original WHOQOL-BREF comprised 26 questions and included four domains: physical, psychological, social relationships, and environment. The WHOQOL-BREF scale has been adapted for Taiwan and added two questions appropriate for Taiwanese culture.</description>
