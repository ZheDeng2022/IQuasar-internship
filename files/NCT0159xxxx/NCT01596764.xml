    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to describe the effects of repeated-dose methylnaltrexone in&#xD;
      preventing loperamide-induced delay of whole-gut, oro-cecal and colon transit time and to&#xD;
      measure pharmacokinetics of methylnaltrexone and naloxone-3-glucuronide after oral&#xD;
      administration of methylnaltrexone and naloxone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The increasing prevalence of opioid use and consequently, opioid-induced bowel dysfunction&#xD;
      has prompted interest in identifying effective treatment options. Until now, the treatment of&#xD;
      opioid-induced constipation (OIC) has been viewed as an extension of constipation in general.&#xD;
      Traditional therapies for constipation such as bulking agents, stool softeners, stimulant&#xD;
      laxatives, and osmotic agents are commonly utilized, but the effects of such therapies are&#xD;
      nonspecific and are often generating diarrhea or cramps and some of these drugs cause severe&#xD;
      side effects. Furthermore, these conventional measures are sometimes insufficient in some&#xD;
      patients, especially those requiring increasing doses of opioids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Opioid-induced constipation is predominantly mediated by gastrointestinal μ-opioid receptors.&#xD;
      Selective blockade of these peripheral receptors might relieve constipation without&#xD;
      compromising centrally mediated effects of opioid analgesia or precipitating withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Naloxone is a competitive antagonist of opioid receptors inside and outside the central&#xD;
      nervous system used as a solution for injection in the treatment of opioid overdose. When&#xD;
      administered orally, it can reduce opioid-induced constipation due to a local action in the&#xD;
      gut. It has a high first-pass metabolism, which is an advantage as the laxative effect can be&#xD;
      achieved due to the local action in the gut without significant antagonism of the narcotic&#xD;
      analgesic effect of opioid. In some patients, however, withdrawal symptoms or reduction of&#xD;
      analgesia was seen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another way to prevent central actions is the use of opioid antagonists which cannot&#xD;
      penetrate the blood-brain barrier such as methylnaltrexone and alvimopan. Their antagonism of&#xD;
      μ-opioid receptors in the gastrointestinal tract seems to reverse opioid-induced gut&#xD;
      hypomotility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is assumed that methylnaltrexone after oral administration influences intestinal motility&#xD;
      by local blockade of opioid receptors along the luminal surface of the gut. Because&#xD;
      methylnaltrexone seems to have an absorption window in the proximal small intestine as caused&#xD;
      by lower activity of P-glycoprotein in that region (similar to other quatenary compounds, eg.&#xD;
      trospium chloride), immediate release (uncoated) methylnaltrexone is better absorbed form the&#xD;
      small intestine and might therefore be less active than the enteric-coated drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data on oral methylnaltrexone are very&#xD;
      preliminarily so far. The data were obtained in rather small groups with inadequate study&#xD;
      design (no randomization, no cross-over, lack of sensitive analytical assays etc.)&#xD;
      Furthermore, intestinal transit time has been measured using lactulose as a probe compound&#xD;
      that has an own laxative effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the following clinical study was initiated to proof the concept in a controlled&#xD;
      clinical trial in healthy subjects, whether extended release methylnaltrexone antagonizes the&#xD;
      loperamide induced delay of oro-cecal and whole-gut transit time in comparison to extended&#xD;
      release naloxone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Loperamide is an opioid agonist and acts on the µ-receptors in the myenteric plexus. It does&#xD;
      not affect the central nervous system like other opioids. Loperamide significantly prolongs&#xD;
      the mouth-to-cecum transit time as evaluated by the lactulose hydrogen breath test. This&#xD;
      effect may be antagonized by the concomitant administration of naloxone.&#xD;
