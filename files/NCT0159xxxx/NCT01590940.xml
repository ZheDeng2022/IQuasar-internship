  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of synthetic mesh plugs for open inguinal hernia repair has seen dramatic variability&#xD;
      in the number and composition of meshes currently on the world market. The use of&#xD;
      biomaterials (PLLA, PGA) in hernia mesh is a relatively new and innovative method. These&#xD;
      selected polymers have the ability to degrade while implanted, allowing for sufficient&#xD;
      natural tissue healing and scarring. This usage presumably favors a decrease in foreignness,&#xD;
      inflammatory reaction, recurrence, and incidence of chronic groin pain. Prior studies with&#xD;
      similar plug meshes in the same indication have yielded favorable results which require this&#xD;
      mesh to be investigated in its specific application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluate the incidence of peri-operative and post-operative complications after the&#xD;
      application of the Parietex plug and patch hernia system in open inguinal hernia repair. We&#xD;
      will assess the efficacy of this mesh by examination and the application of a pain scale at&#xD;
      the following intervals: 1 month, 3 months, and 1 year, respectively. Assessment is intended&#xD;
      to evaluate:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient report of pain via their Pain score&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Wound complication&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incidence of chronic groin pain&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recurrence rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other complications Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Record the description and assessment of the Parietex plug and patch hernia system:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  surgical technique&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  description of dissection and mesh placement&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  method of fixation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  operative times, anesthesia choice&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  length of hospital stay&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  mesh handling characteristics&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  return to daily activities&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  overall patient satisfaction&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a post-market single center pilot study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the&#xD;
      Parietex plug and patch hernia system following open inguinal hernia repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Parietex plug and patch hernia system is composed of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a pre-cut patch made from lightweight monofilament polyester&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a semiresorbable disk which is a bio-component made of polyester monofilament and&#xD;
           poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who meet criteria for the study will be invited to join the study at their consult&#xD;
      prior to surgery. F. Andrew Morfesis M.D. FACS will consent the patient, and offer to answer&#xD;
      questions and address concerns. Once the patient has provided informed consent, they will be&#xD;
      given a hernia surgery specific survey (mesh specific quality of life scale) that will test&#xD;
      parameters such as pain, discomfort in movements, and pain frequency. Post operatively,&#xD;
      research assistants will review the chart to collect data on secondary objectives from the&#xD;
      Operative Note. This data will be entered into a secure excel database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will be explained by Dr. Morfesis that these questionnaires must be completed in-person&#xD;
      during subsequent follow-up visits. Follow-up visits will be scheduled at 1 month, 3 months,&#xD;
      and 1 year, at which time the patient will be examined, and will fill out the hernia surgery&#xD;
      specific measure to evaluate pain at follow up. If patients cannot be scheduled for their&#xD;
      follow-up visits, pain questionnaires will be given over the phone by a research assistant to&#xD;
      reduce data loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Selection&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will include 50 patients following the criteria described below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients regardless of gender &gt; 18 years of age presenting with inguinal hernias.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will be informed of the nature of the study, and have provided signed written&#xD;
           consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Excluded groups will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  children under the age of 18&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  subjects that meet criteria for biologic mesh placement&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  emergency procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  recurrent hernias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Withdrawal Criteria Subjects may withdraw or be withdrawn from the study at any time. The&#xD;
      reason for discontinuation will be collected. Additionally, subjects may be withdrawn from&#xD;
      the study by the principle investigator for noncompliance with study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study subjects will be evaluated at the following time points:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening (pre-operative) Patients will be informed by Dr. Morfesis about the nature of the&#xD;
      study and if they are in agreement to participate the signed consent will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior medical/surgical history will be obtained at time of consultation. Any additional&#xD;
      testing or imaging that may be needed will also be obtained before the time of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive a pre-operative hernia pain scale. This scale has been tailored after&#xD;
      numerous validated hernia mesh scales assessing types of pain, frequency of pain, and quality&#xD;
      of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure OR time Intra-operative device related adverse events Technique Method of fixation&#xD;
      Length of hospital stay Mesh handling Type of anesthesia&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up will occur at 1 month, 3 months, and 1 year visit Patients will fill out the hernia&#xD;
      pain scale. Wound examination Scar thickness and appearance Suture infections Post-operative&#xD;
      device related adverse events Recurrence Chronic groin pain Other complications&#xD;
