  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 60 obese, but otherwise healthy, subjects will be assessed in this benchmark&#xD;
      study to investigate the physiological changes associated with weight loss and regain. The&#xD;
      aim is to estimate the changes in body composition during and after three interventions (i)&#xD;
      calorie restricted diet + a marketed anti-obesity drug (sibutramine )(ii) calorie restricted&#xD;
      diet + sibutramine placebo, and (iii) calorie restricted diet + moderate exercise. The&#xD;
      interventions will last 12 weeks, after which there is a further 12 week observation period&#xD;
      during which subjects will return to their normal lifestyle and are expected to regain&#xD;
      weight. Additionally, a range of biomarkers may be evaluated to determine whether there are&#xD;
      correlations at early and late time points with weight and fat loss and weight and fat&#xD;
      regain. The changes in body composition and other biomarkers will be used to determine&#xD;
      whether mathematical models can be built that predict the weight loss and regain of&#xD;
      individual subjects. In addition, the usefulness of tools that may aid the physiological&#xD;
      characterisation of weight loss/regain will be assessed, in particular methods for measuring&#xD;
      energy expenditure and energy intake such as ambulatory activity meter, Sussex Ingestion&#xD;
      Pattern Monitor ™ (SIPM), hunger-satiety VAS, indirect calorimetry and, if available, the&#xD;
      Theranos in-home graphical user interface (GUI) portal. Knowledge of the body composition&#xD;
      changes resulting from these typical weight loss interventions and predictive markers of&#xD;
      response would facilitate the design of future studies for novel anti-obesity agents and&#xD;
      allow earlier, more informed triaging of NCEs.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Has been obese from approximately the age of 18 or above.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has demonstrated previous weight loss sustained for a minimum of one month.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pre-menopausal female subjects of child bearing potential who are not pregnant or&#xD;
             breast feeding will be eligible to participate if they comply with the following:&#xD;
             Abstinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The lifestyle of female subjects should be such that there is complete abstinence from&#xD;
        intercourse from at least 30 days prior to receiving study medication and to continue until&#xD;
        30 days beyond the last study event, or 5 half lives of the study medication, whichever is&#xD;
        the longest. If a subject claims abstinence as their method of contraception, they must&#xD;
        agree to use a double barrier method (condoms, cervical/vault cap or diaphragm plus&#xD;
        spermicide) should they become sexually active during the time frame described above. One&#xD;
        of the following methods is acceptable as the sole method of contraception if there is&#xD;
        indisputable data that it is &gt;99% effective, otherwise it should be used with a barrier&#xD;
        method (condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) used with spermicidal&#xD;
        foam/gel/film/cream/suppository): Documented tubal ligation, IUD or IUS, Oral&#xD;
        contraception, Male partner sterilization (vasectomy) at least 6 months prior to the female&#xD;
        subject's entry into the study and is the sole partner for that female subject. Condom or&#xD;
        occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal&#xD;

             the Investigator the subject exceeds size limitations for the instruments.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a history of clinically significant eating disorders (diagnosed and/or treated)&#xD;
             such as previous anorexia nervosa, binge-eating disorder or bulimia nervosa.&#xD;

             greater than 3 units), or defined for females, as an average weekly intake of greater&#xD;
             than 14 units (or an average daily intake of greater than 2 units). One unit is&#xD;
             equivalent to a half-pint (220mL) of beer or 1 (25mL) measure of spirits or 1 glass&#xD;
             (125mL) of wine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects will not be eligible if they plan to alter their current smoking (or other&#xD;
             tobacco use) status during the course of the study, or if they have quit smoking less&#xD;
             than 3 months prior to screening. Because of the effects of tobacco smoke on&#xD;
             biomarkers, subjects may be classified as 'never smokers' or 'current smokers&#xD;
             (abstaining at study visit) + former smokers'.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who could not refrain from smoking during the time of the visit in the unit.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Positive results for hepatitis C antibodies, hepatitis B surface antigen, or HIV at&#xD;
             screening. If negative results have been obtained in the last 6 months, it is not&#xD;
             necessary to repeat the tests unless indicated by clinical judgment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a documented history of hepatobiliary disease or hepatic enzyme elevation&#xD;
             including any one of the following: ALT or AST &gt; 2.5 times the upper limit of normal&#xD;
             at screening or pre-intervention Total bilirubin &gt; 1.5 times the upper limit of normal&#xD;
             at screening or pre-intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects above this limit may only be included if direct bilirubin is within normal limits,&#xD;
        which would be consistent with Gilbert's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Fasting triglycerides &gt; 600mg/dL at screening or pre-intervention. If receiving&#xD;
             lipidlowering therapy, then the subject must have been on stable doses for at least 3&#xD;
             months prior to screening.&#xD;

          -  Has known type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus; or has fasting plasma glucose ≥ 126mg/dL&#xD;
             (7.0 mmol/L) at screening. Subjects who fall outside this range but below 140 mg/dL&#xD;
             fasting will be evaluated for inclusion by the PI or designee.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a thyroid disorder that is not under adequate control with a stable dose of&#xD;
             hormone replacement for at least 3 months prior to screening. Inadequate control is&#xD;
             defined as a TSH level below the lower limit of the reference range (LLRR) or &gt; 1.5&#xD;
&#xD;
             × ULRR at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a systolic BP above 150 mmHg and/or diastolic BP above 90 mmHg at screening. If&#xD;
             receiving anti-hypertensive therapy, then the subject must have been on stable doses&#xD;
             for at least 3 months prior to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Is incapable or unwilling to participate in a moderate walking exercise program.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Has any clinically significant abnormality identified on the medical or laboratory&#xD;
             evaluation, including 12-lead ECG. A subject with a clinically significant abnormality&#xD;
             or laboratory parameters outside the reference range for this age group may be&#xD;
             included only if the Investigator considers that the finding will not introduce&#xD;
             additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures. Any&#xD;
             questions regarding the significance of abnormal clinical findings in screening&#xD;
             results should be discussed with the GSK Medical Monitor.&#xD;

             inducer) or 5 half-lives (which ever is longer) prior to the first dose of study&#xD;
             medication, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and Sponsor the medication will&#xD;
             not interfere with the study procedures or compromise subject safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Planning to commence or stop HRT or oral contraceptives during the course of the&#xD;
             study. Female subjects who are taking an oral contraceptive preparation at the time of&#xD;
             screening may be eligible for enrollment in the study.&#xD;
