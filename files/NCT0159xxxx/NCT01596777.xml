      The purpose of this study is to describe the effects of methylnaltrexone in preventing&#xD;
      loperamide-induced delay of the oro-cecal and whole-gut transit time and measure&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of methylnaltrexone after subcutaneous and oral administration of immediate&#xD;
      release and extended release capsules.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The increasing prevalence of opioid use and consequently, opioid-induced bowel dysfunction&#xD;
      has prompted interest in identifying effective treatment options. Until now, the treatment of&#xD;
      opioid-induced constipation (OIC) has been viewed as an extension of constipation in general.&#xD;
      Traditional therapies for constipation such as bulking agents, stool softeners, stimulant&#xD;
      laxatives, and osmotic agents are commonly utilized, but the effects of such therapies are&#xD;
      nonspecific and are often generating diarrhea or cramps and some of these drugs cause severe&#xD;
      side effects. Furthermore, these conventional measures are sometimes insufficient in some&#xD;
      patients, especially those requiring increasing doses of opioids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Opioid-induced constipation is predominantly mediated by gastrointestinal μ-opioid receptors.&#xD;
      Selective blockade of these peripheral receptors might relieve constipation without&#xD;
      compromising centrally mediated effects of opioid analgesia or precipitating withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Naloxone is a competitive antagonist of opioid receptors inside and outside the central&#xD;
      nervous system used as a solution for injection in the treatment of opioid overdose. When&#xD;
      administered orally, it can reduce opioid-induced constipation due to a local action in the&#xD;
      gut.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another way to prevent central actions is the use of opioid antagonists which can't penetrate&#xD;
      the blood-brain barrier such as methylnaltrexone and alvimopan. Their antagonism of μ-opioid&#xD;
      receptors in the gastrointestinal tract seems to reverse opioid-induced gut hypomotility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is assumed that methylnaltrexone after oral administration influences intestinal motility&#xD;
      by local blockade of opioid receptors along the luminal surface of the gut. Because&#xD;
      methylnaltrexone seems to have an absorption window in the proximal small intestine as caused&#xD;
      by lower activity of P-glycoprotein in that region (similar to other quaternary compounds,&#xD;
      eg. trospium chloride), immediate release (uncoated) methylnaltrexone is better absorbed form&#xD;
      the small intestine and might therefore be less active than the enteric-coated drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data on oral methylnaltrexone are very&#xD;
      preliminarily so far. Furthermore, intestinal transit time has been measured using lactulose&#xD;
      as a probe compound that has an own laxative effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the following clinical study was initiated to proof the concept in a controlled&#xD;
      clinical trial in healthy subjects, whether methylnaltrexone antagonizes the loperamide&#xD;
      induced delay of oro-cecal and whole-gut transit time after oral administration of immediate&#xD;
      and extended release capsules in comparison to subcutaneous administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Loperamide is an opioid agonist and acts on the µ-receptors in the myenteric plexus. It does&#xD;
      not affect the central nervous system like other opioids. Loperamide significantly prolongs&#xD;
      the mouth-to-cecum transit time as evaluated by the lactulose hydrogen breath test. This&#xD;
      effect may be antagonized by the concomitant administration of naloxone.&#xD;

    <measure>Oro-cecal transit time</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 24 h after administration of sulfasalazine</time_frame>
    <description>Oro-cecal transit time (OCT) was defined as the first appearance of sulfapyridine in the blood after oral administration of 500 mg sulfasalazine immediate release tablets. Because of the high sensitivity of the analytical assay, the OCT was defined as the average of the times needed after sulfasalazine administration to exceed serum concentrations (cut-off) of 50 ng/ml (t50) and of 100 ng/ml (t100).</description>

    <description>Whole-gut transit time (WGT) was assessed by counting the appearance of radio-opaque markers of different shapes (Colon transit capsules) to different time pints in the stool, which were administered 24 h, 12 h and 1 h before administration of the methylnaltrexone study medication. The radio-opaque markers in the stool inside the sampling containers were visualized with an X-ray device (Philips Optimus, Philips Healthcare, Hamburg, Germany, CE 257303004) The images were stored and evaluated using the Agfa PACS Workstation, Impact-Version 5.2 (Agfa-Healthcare, Cologne, Germany).</description>
