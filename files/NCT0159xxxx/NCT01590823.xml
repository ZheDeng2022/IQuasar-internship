  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with end stage renal disease carry a high risk for atrial fibrillation (AF) and&#xD;
      require oral anticoagulant therapy for prevention of stroke. Often, the oral anticoagulant,&#xD;
      warfarin sodium, is prescribed. Managing dialysis patients on warfarin can be fraught will&#xD;
      difficulties given the multitude of drug and food interactions, need for frequent coagulation&#xD;
      monitoring and dosage adjustment, and concern that warfarin enhances vascular calcification&#xD;
      in dialysis patients. Recently, dabigatran etexilate, a direct oral thrombin inhibitor, has&#xD;
      been approved for use in AF patients with normal renal function. Since many drugs are&#xD;
      eliminated by the kidneys and removed from the plasma during dialysis, it is important to&#xD;
      determine proper drug dosing in hemodialysis patients through evaluating pharmacokinetics.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The frequency of atrial fibrillation (AF) is 10- to 20- fold higher in patients with end&#xD;
      stage renal disease (ESRD) compared to the general population (1-5). Conditions contributing&#xD;
      to the risk of stroke in AF are highly prevalent in ESRD patients undergoing dialysis (6). A&#xD;
      large number of trials have shown the usefulness of oral anticoagulation with warfarin sodium&#xD;
      for primary and secondary prevention of stroke in patients with AF (7). Despite that the&#xD;
      majority of these trials excluded patients with ESRD, warfarin sodium is commonly prescribed&#xD;
      in dialysis patients with AF for prevention of stroke (8). Managing dialysis patients on&#xD;
      wafarin sodium is challenging given the plethora of drug and food interactions, need for&#xD;
      frequent coagulation monitoring and dose adjustment and lack of large randomized clinical&#xD;
      trails assessing the benefit of stroke prevention versus risk of hemorrhage in this&#xD;
      population (8,9). Additionally, recent concern regarding the association between vascular&#xD;
      calcification enhanced by warfarin sodium in dialysis patients highlights the need for&#xD;
      alternative oral anticoagulant therapy (10,11).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new oral anticoagulant, dabigatran etexilate, which is a direct thrombin inhibitor, has&#xD;
      been approved for prevention of stroke in patients with AF and prevention of venous&#xD;
      thromboembolic events (VTE) in patients who have undergone elective total hip and knee&#xD;
      replacement surgeries(12-15). Other indications under investigation include the treatment of&#xD;
      VTE (16) and the treatment of thromboembolic complications following acute coronary syndromes&#xD;
      (17).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dabigatran etexilate is an orally administered prodrug, which is rapidly absorbed and&#xD;
      converted to its active form, dabigatran. Dabigatran specifically and reversibly inhibits&#xD;
      thrombin which is a key enzyme required in the coagulation pathway. Dabigatran etexilate&#xD;
      posses beneficial properties including: a fixed oral dosage regimen, predictable&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic profile, strong association between plasma drug concentration and&#xD;
      anticoagulation response, low potential for drug interactions and lack of need for routine&#xD;
      coagulation monitoring (18-24). As such, dabigatran etexilate represents a possible improved&#xD;
      alternative to warfarin for anticoagulation in dialysis patients with AF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dabigatran etexilate has been developed using a fixed dosage regimen of 150 mg twice daily in&#xD;
      AF patients with normal renal function for prevention of stroke (12). Limited information&#xD;
      regarding dosing dabigatran etexilate in patients with renal impairment or ESRD exists as&#xD;
      these patients were excluded from all phase III trials. Despite this, a recent small study&#xD;
      investigated the pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose of dabigatran etexilate 150 mg in&#xD;
      healthy patients and in patients with mild to severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance&#xD;
      &gt;50 to ≤80 , &gt;30 to ≤50 and &lt;30 mL/min) and dabigatran etexilate 50 mg in patients with ESRD&#xD;
      requiring maintenance hemodialysis (25).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systemic exposure to dabigatran and corresponding coagulation response was increased by renal&#xD;
      impairment and correlated with the severity of renal dysfunction suggesting that a reduced&#xD;
      dose and or extended dose interval may be necessary in patients with mild to severe renal&#xD;
      impairment. In the six patients that were studied, hemodialysis removed on average 62% and&#xD;
      68% of the dabigatran entering the dialyzer indicating that hemodialysis can compensate for&#xD;
      the impaired dabigatran renal elimination that occurs in ESRD. Unfortunately, a meaningful&#xD;
      correlation between dabigatran plasma concentrations and anticoagulation activity could not&#xD;
      be determined as the hemodialysis patients were on unfractionated heparin to prevent clotting&#xD;
      in their dialysis circuit. Furthermore, the necessity of a post-dialysis dose to maintain&#xD;
      dabigatran levels in the therapeutic range was not investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Herein, we propose a pilot study to examine the single dose pharmacokinetics and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics of dabigatran etexilate in hemodialysis patients who are receiving normal&#xD;
      saline flushes for prevention of extracorporeal circuit clotting. The specific objective is&#xD;
      to establish baseline correlation between plasma dabigatran concentrations versus&#xD;
      anticoagulation activity over time. Our long-term objective is to develop an evidence-based&#xD;
      recommendation for dabigatran dosing in hemodialysis patients.&#xD;
