  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heparin is an anticoagulant (blood thinner) that is commonly used to treat patients with&#xD;
      heart attacks and patients with blood clots in their legs or lungs (venous thrombosis). Some&#xD;
      patients develop an allergic reaction to heparin, a condition called heparin-induced&#xD;
      thrombocytopenia (HIT). HIT makes blood clot, which is the opposite of what heparin was&#xD;
      designed to do. These blood clots can lead to heart attacks, strokes, limb amputations, and&#xD;
      death. The objective of this 200 patient study is to determine if a new blood thinner called&#xD;
      rivaroxaban (Xarelto) can be used to treat HIT. Rivaroxaban can be taken by mouth, does not&#xD;
      require blood testing, and had a low risk of bleeding when it was used to treat blood clots&#xD;
      in other clinical trials. If this study shows that rivaroxaban can be used to treat HIT,&#xD;
      there will be two very important benefits. For patients with HIT, the benefit will be having&#xD;
      a safe, and easy-to-use drug to protect them from developing further life or limb-threatening&#xD;
      blood clots. For the Canadian health care system, the benefit will be having a drug that is&#xD;
      much less expensive than the drugs currently used to treat HIT.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Consecutive adult patients with an intermediate or high clinical probability for HIT&#xD;
      (according to the clinical prediction rule called the &quot;4T's Score) will receive rivaroxaban&#xD;
      15 mg bid while awaiting confirmation or exclusion of HIT by the local laboratory assay.&#xD;
      Patients who are confirmed to have HIT by the local laboratory assay will continue to receive&#xD;
      rivaroxaban 15 mg bid until their platelet count â‰¥ 150 or until end of study (Day 30). At the&#xD;
      time of platelet count recovery (typically 4-7 days), they will be transitioned to a&#xD;
      maintenance dose of rivaroxaban (20 mg od) for a maximum of 30 days.&#xD;
