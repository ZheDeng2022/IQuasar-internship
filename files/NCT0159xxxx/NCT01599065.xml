  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the two options for management of ICDs (internal&#xD;
      cardioverter defibrillators) in patients undergoing procedures with electrocautery: (1)&#xD;
      programming ICD therapies &quot;off,&quot; or (2) use of a magnet to suspend ICD therapies By comparing&#xD;
      these two techniques the investigators hope to demonstrate the efficiency of using an ICD&#xD;
      magnet protocol during perioperative management of patients undergoing electrocautery&#xD;
      procedures. Secondary purposes are to gain further information on health care resources,&#xD;
      incidence of EMI, handoff communications and to document lack of adverse events in either&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective will be: ICD therapy &quot;off times&quot; will be less with the use of a magnet&#xD;
      protocol compared to an &quot;off-on&quot; protocol. Secondary objectives will be: (1) Healthcare&#xD;
      resources (time and costs of skilled personnel) will be less using a magnet protocol compared&#xD;
      to an off-on protocol, and (2) there will be no difference between adverse events in the&#xD;
      magnet protocol compared to an off-on protocol. The incidence of EMI and number of handoff&#xD;
      communications will be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesis is that the number of minutes with ICD therapies &quot;off&quot; will be&#xD;
      significantly less with magnet use. The investigators also expect health care resources to be&#xD;
      less with magnet use compared to reprogramming.&#xD;

      The study design will be a prospective multi-center randomized controlled trial where&#xD;
      subjects will be randomized to either a control group (ICD &quot;off-on&quot; group) or to the&#xD;
      experimental group (magnet group) within blocks of type of procedure and site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be enrolled at the time of their procedure and will remain in the study until&#xD;
      their post operative device interrogation. This could take place that same day (&quot;off on&quot;&#xD;
      group or registry) or at their next ICD clinic visit or remote transmission (no more than 3&#xD;
      months from the procedure).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study duration from first enrollment to closure is expected to last approximately 12&#xD;
      months. There will be only two enrolling centers and the target sample size is 150 subjects&#xD;
      from various manufacturers. No specific sample size was calculated as this is a pilot study.&#xD;

        Patients who have an ICD and are patients at Edward Hospital or Advocate Good Samaritan&#xD;
        undergoing surgical, endoscopic and interventional radiologic procedures will be considered&#xD;
        for the study. Hospital and cardiology practice staff will identify potential subjects by&#xD;
        reviewing surgical, endoscopic and interventional radiologic procedure schedules. When&#xD;
        patients with an ICD are identified research staff will be notified. Any scheduled adult&#xD;
        patient with a past medical history of an ICD will be considered for participation. If&#xD;
        electrocautery is anticipated for the procedure this patient will be screened for the&#xD;
        study.&#xD;
