  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pembrolizumab will have significant clinical activity in patients with Intermediate and high&#xD;
      risk MF, advanced PV who have been resistant, failed or are intolerant to JAK2 inhibitor&#xD;
      therapy and the activity may be enhanced in combination with JAK2 inhibition by Ruxolitinib;&#xD;
      similarly MDS/MPN and CMML patients for who no standard therapies are available will exhibit&#xD;
      responses to PD-1 or dual JAK2 and PD-1 treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adding JAK2 inhibitor Ruxolitinib to Pembrolizumab will have significant activity in patients&#xD;
      with advanced, progressive HL who failed single agent PD-1 inhibition.&#xD;
