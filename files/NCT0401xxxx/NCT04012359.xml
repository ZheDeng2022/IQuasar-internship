  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a frequent disease affecting a growing number&#xD;
      of adults in the world which is responsible for a large public health burden through heavy&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emphysema is one of a wide spectrum of pulmonary complications linked to COPD, defined as the&#xD;
      abnormal permanent enlargement of the airspaces distal to the terminal bronchioles&#xD;
      accompanied by destruction of the alveolar wall. Disease progression is correlated to&#xD;
      worsening and enlargement of emphysema lesions, sometimes conflating in sizeable bullae,&#xD;
      deleterious to normal mechanical pulmonary function. Bullous emphysema (BE) is sometimes&#xD;
      eligible to invasive curative treatment through surgery or interventional bronchoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosis of BE relies on computerized tomodensitometry (CT), the gold-standard for&#xD;
      evaluating pulmonary parenchyma. However, CT is not always available, and bullous emphysema&#xD;
      can present as pneumothorax on chest radiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The practice of lung ultrasound is currently growing in respiratory medicine and emergency&#xD;
      departments owing to an increasing amount of evidence showcasing its reliability as a&#xD;
      diagnostic tool, most notably for pneumothorax and other pleural diseases. Despite BE having&#xD;
      been reported to present similarly to pneumothorax in ultrasound, its characteristics have&#xD;
      not yet been precisely described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this study is to describe BE using lung ultrasound. Participants with&#xD;
      known BE on CT will undergo a simple ultrasound examination. The secondary aim is to compare&#xD;
      the characteristics of BE to those of pneumothorax using lung ultrasound. To achieve this, a&#xD;
      second group of participants with currently treated pneumothorax will also undergo lung&#xD;
      ultrasound.&#xD;

    <description>Calculation of sensitivity values of lung ultrasound for bullous emphysema for each sonographic sign. Study design prohibits calculation of specificity.&#xD;
A quantitative discrete score will be constructed by enumerating signs which are positive in favor of bullous emphysema, able to discriminate between both diseases. AUC will be calculated. An AUC &lt; 0.75 will be considered as insufficient for establishing lung ultrasound as a diagnostic test for bullous emphysema. An AUC &gt; 0.75 would prompt further studies.</description>
