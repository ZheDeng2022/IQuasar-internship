      Single Center, open label, Phase I-II trial designed to test the safety and efficacy of the&#xD;
      combination of Ataluren and Pembrolizumab for the treatment of metastatic mismatch repair&#xD;
      deficient and proficient colorectal adenocarcinoma and metastatic mismatch repair deficient&#xD;
      endometrial carcinoma.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In controlling tumor outgrowth an intact immune surveillance is very important. PD-1&#xD;
      receptor-ligand interaction is a major pathway hijacked by tumors to suppress this immune&#xD;
      control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab is a potent and highly selective humanized monoclonal antibody designed to&#xD;
      directly block the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands and is registered for the&#xD;
      treatment of advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma of locally advanced or metastatic&#xD;
      NSCLC in adults. In an earlier study it's effect has been shown in mismatch repair deficient&#xD;
      tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ataluren is designed to allow the protein making apparatus (the ribosome) in cells to skip&#xD;
      over a premature stop codon (PTC), allowing the cells to translate the sequence downstream of&#xD;
      a premature termination codon (PTC) in mRNA transcripts. This may result in the translation&#xD;
      of additional out-of-frame code, which is available in abundance in dMMR tumors. We argue&#xD;
      that this may result in new target peptides for the immune-system to recognize cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the formation of these peptides by Ataluren can enhance&#xD;
      the effect of Pembrolizumab anti-PD1 therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore the investigators designed a Single Center, open label, Phase I-II trial designed&#xD;
      to test the safety and efficacy of the combination of Ataluren and Pembrolizumab for the&#xD;
      treatment of metastatic mismatch repair deficient and proficient colorectal adenocarcinoma&#xD;
      and metastatic mismatch repair deficient endometrial carcinoma.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>In the phase-1 part of the study 2-4 groups of 3 patients each are treated with pembrolizumab 200mg i.v. q3w but with increasing ataluren doses (i.e. group1 25%, group2 50% and group3 100% of 10-10-20mg/kg). These can be either pMMR mCRC, dMMR mCRC or dMMR EC patients. The reported toxicity in phase-1 will be used to define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination, that will determine the ataluren dose in phase-2.&#xD;
In the phase-2 part of the study a dMMR group (cohort A, 20 patients either CRC of EC) and a pMMR group (cohort B, 15 CRC patients) will be treated with pembrolizumab 200mg i.v. q3w combined with ataluren t.i.d. at the MTD defined in phase-1.&#xD;
