  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates the evolution of sensory, motor and tissue variables following&#xD;
      exercise-induced pain in wrist extensor muscles in healthy subjects.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine how is the normalization process of sensory (pressure&#xD;
      pain thresholds, subjective pain sensation, self-recovery perception), motor (maximal&#xD;
      isometric strength, active range of motion, manual dexterity) and tissue (myotonometer)&#xD;
      variables after an experimental pain model in the extensor forearms muscles, by delayed onset&#xD;
      muscle soreness after an eccentric exercise in healthy subjects. This way will be possible to&#xD;
      establish 1) if there are differences in the time of normalization for each variable; 2) if&#xD;
      there is a correlation between each variable and self-recovery perception.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seven assessment sessions are performed in a 14-days period. Day 0 (baseline assessment 1),&#xD;
      Day 7 (baseline assessment 2, pre exercise), Day 7 (post exercise), Day 8 (24-hours post&#xD;
      exercise), Day 9 (48-hours post exercise), Day 10 (72-hours post exercise), Day 14 (1-week&#xD;
      post exercise).&#xD;

    <time_frame>Day-1 (baseline), Day-14 (1-week post-exercise).</time_frame>
    <description>Punctuation obtained in Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS). It comprises 13 items which focus on thoughts and feelings encountered while experiencing pain. Each item is scored from 0 (not at all) to 4 (all the time) with a total PCS score range from 0-52 points, where higher scores indicating higher levels of pain catastrophizing.</description>
