      The aim of work is to assess and compare the analgesic efficacy of bilateral erector spinae&#xD;
      plane block with that of bilateral transversus abdominis plane block after elective cesarean&#xD;

      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Parturients aged 18 - 40 years with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status І&#xD;
      or ІІ, scheduled for elective cesarean section via a low transverse abdominal incision&#xD;
      (Pfannenstiel) and receiving intrathecal anesthesia without sedation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient refusal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Contraindications to regional anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Known allergy to the study drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Severe cardiovascular, renal or hepatic diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bleeding disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Local infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly divided into two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A will receive bilateral Erector spinae plane block. (n=30) Group B will receive&#xD;
      bilateral Transversus abdominis plane block. (n=30) Simple randomization will be performed by&#xD;
      computer-generated random numbers that will be placed in separate opaque envelopes that will&#xD;
      be opened by responsible anesthesiologist just before the intrathecal block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine preoperative investigations including electrocardiogram (ECG), complete blood&#xD;
      picture, renal function tests, liver function tests, and coagulation profile will be done.&#xD;
      All parturients will fast for 8 h preoperatively. IV access will be obtained (one peripheral&#xD;
      venous cannula 18G) and standard monitoring including pulse oximetry, ECG and noninvasive&#xD;
      blood pressure will be placed for measurement of the hemodynamic variability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ten ml.kg-1 of Ringer lactate solution will be infused over 15 minutes as a preload. The&#xD;
      parturient will be asked to turn into sitting position where the skin on the back will be&#xD;
      sterilized and spinal anesthesia will be performed via a midline approach into the L4-5&#xD;
      interspaces using a 25 gauge Quincke spinal needle after giving 3 ml of lidocaine 2% as a&#xD;
      subcutaneous infiltration. After confirming free CSF flow through the needle, a 10mg of&#xD;
      hyperbaric bupivacaine 0.5 % will be slowly injected for both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The parturient will be placed in the supine position with 15° left tilt, and an oxygen mask&#xD;
      will be applied at 2 L.min-1. The surgical procedure will start after sufficient anesthesia&#xD;
      level is obtained, with continuous hemodynamics monitoring and recording.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After delivery of the fetus, 10 units of oxytocin will be given by IV infusion. By the end of&#xD;
      the surgery, patients in group (A) received bilateral ESP block. First in the supine&#xD;
      position, sham TAP block was done then the patient was turned into the lateral position to&#xD;
      receive ESP block and after&#xD;
&#xD;
      proper skin sterilization then the vertebrae were counted from cephalad to caudal direction&#xD;
      until T9 spinous process was reached as the first palpable spinous process is C7 and at this&#xD;
      level a linear ultrasound (US) transducer (Phillips Saronno Italy) was placed vertically 3cm&#xD;
      lateral to the midline to visualize the back muscles superior to the transverse process. -A&#xD;
      22-G short bevel needle (spinocan, B.Braun, melsungen AG, Germany) was inserted in&#xD;
      cranial-caudal direction until it make contact with the transverse process. Confirmation of&#xD;
      the correct position of the tip of the needle was by injection of 1 ml saline causing&#xD;
      hydrodisscetion between the erector spinae muscle and the transverse process. After careful&#xD;
      aspiration to exclude vascular puncture, 20 ml 0.25 % bupivacaine was injected. The same&#xD;
      procedure was done on the other side of the back. -Patients in group (B) received bilateral&#xD;
      TAP block. First in the supine position a linear ultrasound (US) transducer (Phillips Saronno&#xD;
      Italy) was placed transversally on the anterolateral abdominal wall in the midaxillary line&#xD;
      between the iliac crest and the costal margin identifying external oblique, internal oblique&#xD;
      and transversus abdominis muscles. The TAP is between internal oblique and transversus&#xD;
      abdominis. -A 22-G needle (spinocan, B.Braun, melsungen AG, Germany) was introduced&#xD;
      anteriorly to the transducer and advanced to reach the TAP between internal oblique muscle&#xD;
      and transversus abdominis muscle. After careful aspiration to exclude vascular puncture, 20&#xD;
      ml 0.25 % bupivacaine was injected causing an elliptical separation of the two muscles. The&#xD;
      same procedure was done on the other side. Then the patient was placed in the lateral&#xD;
      position to do sham ESP block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be instructed to notify us if they have experienced any signs of systemic&#xD;
      toxicity as circumoral or tongue numbness, dizziness, visual and auditory disturbances as&#xD;
      difficulty focusing and tinnitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spinal level will be assessed and recorded before both blocks in all patients, then they will&#xD;
      be transferred to postoperative anesthesia care unit (PACU) with standard monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After surgery the patient will receive paracetamol 1gm IV infusion/8 hours, ketorolac 30 mg&#xD;
      IV/12hours as a multimodal analgesia for postoperative pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative pain will be assessed by Visual analog scale (VAS) for pain (ranging from 0 to&#xD;
      10, where 0 no pain and 10 the worst possible pain) at time intervals at 0 hour, 4hours, 8&#xD;
      hours, 12hours and 24 hours. Postoperative mean arterial blood pressure and heart rate will&#xD;
      be assessed and recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time for the first request to analgesia and total analgesic consumption will be recorded in&#xD;
      the first 24 hours after surgery. Any complications as nausea and vomiting will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensory block by a pin prick test will be assessed (0: normal sensation, 1: decreased pain&#xD;
      sensation, 2: loss of pain sensation). The duration of the sensory block which is the time&#xD;
      interval between performance of the block and complete resolution of anesthesia will be&#xD;
      assessed and recorded every 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient satisfaction with analgesia will be assessed as (0: poor, 1: good, 2: excellent).&#xD;
