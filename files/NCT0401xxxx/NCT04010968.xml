    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to test the potential benefit of an innovative combination of&#xD;
      targeted therapy over the standard the immunochemotherapy (FCR). The interest in this study&#xD;
      resides in an MRD driven discontinuation of the novel agents, and a fixed maximum duration of&#xD;
      these agents. This design allows a true comparison of the efficacy of IV with the&#xD;
      immuno-chemotherapy at 2 years of treatment and later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, other trials propose to include to all risk categories of patients, and we are&#xD;
      developing here a stratification preventing the dilution of the results. The intermediate&#xD;
      risk patients are the ones for which alternative to chemotherapy is critical, as chemotherapy&#xD;
      is likely to alter the clonal evolution of their disease, whereas the low risk patients are&#xD;
      already doing well with standard treatment and are likely to benefit from other therapies as&#xD;
      well. The high risk patients, id est patients with 17p deletion and or TP 53 mutational&#xD;
      status responded very well to new drugs as BTK inhibitors or BLC2 inhibitors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The combination of venetoclax (V) and ibrutinib (I) has recently emerged as a very effective&#xD;
      therapy in both relapse and front-line settings. The preliminary results of the CLARITY (R/R&#xD;
      CLL) and CAPTIVATE (untreated CLL) studies have demonstrated the promising potential of the&#xD;
      I+VEN combination, which led to a very high rate of bone marrow MRD negativity. Moreover, the&#xD;
      I+VEN combination might be given for only a definite period of time, contrarily to each of&#xD;
      the two drugs which are given until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity per Smpc,&#xD;
      according to their respective labels. The combination of V and I makes sense because of their&#xD;
      in vitro synergy, non-overlapping toxicities and differential activity on different&#xD;
      compartments of the disease. Therefore, the direct comparison in the front-line setting of&#xD;
      the gold standard immuno-chemotherapy combining Rituximab plus Fludarabine and&#xD;
      Cyclophosphamide FCR and an innovative chemo-free regimen combining I and V is essential in&#xD;
      the intermediate-risk patients who benefit much less from FCR than the low-risk patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective : to evaluate the efficacy of the chemo-free combination of ibrutinib and&#xD;
      venetoclax in previously untreated intermediate-risk CLL in a face to face comparison with&#xD;
      the gold standard immuno-chemotherapy regimen FCR in order to assess if it may replace&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the progression-free survival (PFS), event-free survival (EFS), overall&#xD;
           survival (OS) and time to next treatment (TTNT)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety of the combination I + VEN&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the dose intensity (RDI) of both treatments&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the response (Complete Response / CR, CR with incomplete blood count recovery&#xD;
           / CRi , CR with undetectable Measurable Residual Disease/MRD, Partial Remission / PR,&#xD;
           nPR, with and without undetectable MRD)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the incidence of Richter transformation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Innovative aspects of this trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Patient stratification based on robust prognostic factors. The risk stratification is based&#xD;
      on IGHV status, genetic alterations by FISH analysis, karyotype and NGS (TP53 mutation), as&#xD;
      now recommended by the IWCLL 2018 guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Focus on the intermediate-risk CLL patients (as defined above) who represent more than half&#xD;
      of the CLL patients in need of first-line therapy and for whom replacement of FCR with a more&#xD;
      effective innovative approach is a crucial issue.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Direct comparison between immuno-chemotherapy and a very effective chemo-free arm&#xD;
           combining a BTK inhibitor and a Bcl2 inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MRD use to optimize treatment strategy in the experimental arm. Early treatment&#xD;
           discontinuation will be considered in patients who will rapidly reach bone marrow MRD&#xD;
           negativity (&lt; 10-4).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of a fixed duration of treatment with targeted therapy that will not be&#xD;
           continued beyond 24 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of the kinetics of reappearance of the disease by regular monitoring of the&#xD;
           MRD in both arms.&#xD;
