      This trial requires healthy volunteers to wear a selection of CE marked electrodes for up to&#xD;
      30 days. The results from this trial will determine which electrodes should be used with the&#xD;
      CAVA device, which is a medical device for monitoring dizziness.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dizziness is a common condition that is responsible for a significant degree of material&#xD;
      morbidity and burden on our health service. There are multiple causes of dizziness, and these&#xD;
      originate from pathologies affecting a large variety of different organ systems. Dizziness is&#xD;
      usually episodic and short-lived, so when a patient presents to their health care provider,&#xD;
      examination is often normal. As such, diagnosis is challenging and patients often experience&#xD;
      significant delay in receiving a diagnosis. We have developed a device for monitoring&#xD;
      dizziness and in 2018 we evaluated the device by undertaking a clinical trial involving&#xD;
      healthy volunteers. Following the promising results from the first trial, we will conduct a&#xD;
      second trial in 2019 on patients suffering from dizziness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the healthy volunteer trial, a minor issue was encountered relating to long-term daily&#xD;
      wear of the device's electrode pads. Specifically, nine participants reported varying degrees&#xD;
      of skin redness and inflammation beneath their electrode pads, mostly occurring after around&#xD;
      two weeks of wear. The issue was self-limiting and resolved after a few days of non-wear. The&#xD;
      team worked closely with a consultant dermatologist in order to monitor and manage this&#xD;
      adverse event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the issue was identified, the team has consulted with a number of people with relevant&#xD;
      expertise in order to determine the causes of the issue and to find the most viable solution.&#xD;
      Based on these discussions, we propose that the causes of this issue were due to a&#xD;
      combination of wear duration, and/or repeated removal, and/or the specific type of electrode&#xD;
      pad used. To confidently identify the cause of this issue and to evaluate a number of&#xD;
      possible solutions, we intend to undertake a trial to evaluate the tolerability of&#xD;
      alternative electrode pads and different patterns of wear.&#xD;

    <description>Participants wear six electrode pads in total; three different types of pad, worn in the same positions on both sides of the face. The pads on the left-hand side of the face are replaced daily, and those on the right-hand side are replaced every other day. The pads do not administer a medical treatment or perform any other active function. The purpose of the intervention is to determine which combination of pad and replacement regime maximises the tolerability of wear over a 30-day period.</description>
