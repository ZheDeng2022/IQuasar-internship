      Assessing the safety and efficacy of the bevacizumab (FKB238), Olaparib and Durvalumab (MEDI&#xD;
      4736) combination in patient with high grade serous or high grade endometrioid or other high&#xD;
      grade epithelial non mucinous ovarian tumor, with at least one previous line of&#xD;
      platinum-taxane chemotherapy, and present with platinum resistant disease (PRR) or&#xD;
      platinum-sensitive relapse (PSR), whatever the line of chemotherapy given at relapse.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bevacizumab and olaparib have already been tested on 12 patients in a phase I trial at their&#xD;
      usual doses (10 mg/kg q2w and 400 mg bid - 50 mg capsules -, respectively), and no DLTs were&#xD;
      observed. The addition of an anti-VEGF small molecule, cediranib, to olaparib doubled the&#xD;
      median PFS in a randomized phase II trial in patients with platinum sensitive relapse, with a&#xD;
      manageable safety profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recently reported phase I trial established the RDP2D of Durvalumab and Olaparib - 150 mg&#xD;
      tablets -, when given in combination, at 1500 mg every 4 weeks, and 300 mg bid, respectively.&#xD;
      In addition, the ENGOT/GINECO PAOLA phase III trial is currently evaluating the combination&#xD;
      of Olaparib and Bevacizumab as first-line maintenance after platinum-paclitaxel combination,&#xD;
      in patients with advanced high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma. Under the hypothesis of a&#xD;
      survival benefit in favor of this combination, it would also be of interest to assess the&#xD;
      value of adding Durvalumab in order to improve the efficacy of the overall combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no trials to date assessing anti-VEGF in combination with anti-PARP and anti-PD-L1&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beside additive efficacy, a synergistic effect could be expected :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Between bevacizumab and durvalumab, through normalization of blood vessel and&#xD;
           potentiation of immunologic infiltration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Between olaparib and durvalumab, through cytotoxicity-mediated release of antigens and&#xD;
           impairment of mutation repair mechanisms, thereby increasing neoantigen loads.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Between olaparib and bevacizumab, through tumor environment modulation and signaling of&#xD;
           DNA damage inhibition, which has already been tested with the anti-VEGF cediranib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For those reasons the sponsor propose a phase II trial of Olaparib, Bevacizumab and&#xD;
      Durvalumab combination, in patients with relapsing AO high grade carcinoma :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In platinum sensitive relapse (PSR), whatever the line, in patients not amenable to&#xD;
           frontline surgery of the relapse and previously-treated by a platinum-containing&#xD;
           chemotherapy in first line and&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Either didn't receive any of the tested drugs,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Or previously received either bevacizumab or olaparib BUT NOT the combination of&#xD;
                both drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In platinum-resistant relapse (PRR), in previously untreated patients for their relapse,&#xD;
           or in patients who received a maximum of 1 chemotherapy regimen in this setting and&#xD;
           either&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Either didn't receive any of the tested drugs,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Or previously received either bevacizumab or olaparib BUT NOT the combination of&#xD;
                both drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will also propose translational research, including :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of germline and somatic BRCA mutations and determination of HRD phenotype and&#xD;
           mutational load by NGS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quantification of mutagenesis in simultaneous treatment on ctDNA&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Characterization of immune response in the tumor by Nanostring immuno-oncology panel on&#xD;
           tumors&#xD;
