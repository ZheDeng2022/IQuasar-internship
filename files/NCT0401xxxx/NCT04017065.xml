    <textblock>
      The aim of this international, prospective, multicenter case series (patient registry) is to&#xD;
      gather the first evidence on the use of the MAXFRAME™ system in normal clinical settings&#xD;
      during deformity correction of both, the upper and lower limb, and gain information on&#xD;
      indications, the handling of the device from the patients' and surgeons' perspective, as well&#xD;
      as number of re-planning needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is planned to prospectively follow up to 100 patients treated with the MAXFRAME™ system.&#xD;
      Information on patients entered into the registry will be collected from before the surgery&#xD;
      until the removal of the device.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The newly developed MAXFRAME™ system from DePuy Synthes® is a multi-Axial correction system&#xD;
      based on the hexapod configuration. The indications for the MAXFRAME™ include, but are not&#xD;
      limited to, the treatment of open or closed fractures of long bones, pseudarthrosis, limb&#xD;
      lengthening via epiphyseal or metaphyseal distraction, joint arthrodesis, to bridge infected&#xD;
      fractures or non-unions, to correct bony or soft tissue deformities, and to correct of&#xD;
      segmental defects. One of the main novelties of this system is the Perspective Frame Matching&#xD;
      (PFM) technique. This software system uses the post-operative x-rays with the entire frame&#xD;
      mounted to the bone to generate a 3D visualization of the frame and the exact mounting&#xD;
      parameters as well as a representation of the deformity with regards to the position within&#xD;
      the frame. This system generates a treatment plan according to the exact representation of&#xD;
      the frame, and the deformity at the starting point of the correction. The risk of a frame&#xD;
      mal-positioning is reduced, which in return is believed to reduce the risk of a false&#xD;
      correction and hopefully leads to a more precise result. Further, this reduces the need for&#xD;
      adaptations to the initial treatment protocol, which require repeated radiological assessment&#xD;
      and may alienate the patient during the whole process of the deformity correction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the investigator's knowledge there are no published studies investigating the accuracy of&#xD;
      this method, therefore the aim of the proposed prospective multicenter registry is to gather&#xD;
      first evidence on the use of the MAXFRAME™ system in clinical settings and gain information&#xD;
      on indications, handling, the number of re-planning's needed, and treatment related adverse&#xD;
      events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 100 patients treated with the MAXFRAME™ system are planned to be included for two years&#xD;
      enrollment period. Each patient will be followed up from before the surgery until the removal&#xD;
      of the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All follow-up visits are according to standard of care. There are fixed time points (visits)&#xD;
      during a normal deformity correction process and follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline = pre-operative assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surgery = application of the frame (defined as day 0)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post-OP = post-operative image assessment (for PFM planning)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Frame removal (including conversion, if applicable)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further, there are additional time points (visits). An additional visit is defined as every&#xD;
      consultation during the deformity correction process, until the frame is removed, when a&#xD;
      registry specific event of interest occurs. The events of interest for additional visits are&#xD;
      the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Re-plannings&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Re-operation / surgical interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Changes to the frame&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment related adverse event&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Deformity corrected&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following data points will be collected pre-, intra- and post-operatively:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients demographics, medical history and underlying diseases, Indication for the use of the&#xD;
      MAXFRAMETM system, Treatment goal(s), Treatment planning, Surgical details, Changes in&#xD;
      treatment plan, Frame removal, Radiological and calculated outcome assessment of the&#xD;
      deformity correction and/or lengthening, Treatment-related Adverse Events, Experience with&#xD;
      MAXFRAMETM system.&#xD;
