    <textblock>
      This study further evaluates the efficacy of bermekimab in treating moderate to severe&#xD;
      hidradenitis suppurativa in adults. 1/3 of patients will receive weekly injections of&#xD;
      bermekimab, 1/3 will receive alternating every other week injections of bermekimab or&#xD;
      placebo, and 1/3 will receive weekly injections of placebo.&#xD;

    <description>HSSD is a 7-item patient self-reported questionnaire that assesses 5 HS-related symptoms including pain, tenderness, hot skin feeling, odor, and itchiness. The participants are asked to rate the severity of each symptom on a 0 to 10 numerical rating scale over the past week, with 0 indicating no symptom experience and 10 indicating the worst possible symptom experience. All 5 symptoms have a recall period of the past 7 days, except for 2 additional questions on pain which evaluate current pain and pain in the past 24 hours. Change from baseline in HS-related pain symptom score (ranging from 0 to 10) will be determined. Patient diaries will be collected weekly.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0) to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-3L consists of 2 pages: the EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS).The EQ-5D-3L descriptive system comprises the following five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 3 levels: no problems, some problems, and extreme problems. The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. This decision results into a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state. The EQ VAS records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale where the endpoints are labelled 'Best imaginable health state' and 'Worst imaginable health state'. The VAS can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome that reflects the patient's own judgement.</description>

    <description>HSSD is a 7-item patient self-reported questionnaire that assesses 5 HS-related symptoms including pain, tenderness, hot skin feeling, odor, and itchiness. The participants are asked to rate the severity of each symptom on a 0 to 10 numerical rating scale, with 0 indicating no symptom experience and 10 indicating the worst possible symptom experience. All 5 symptoms have a recall period of the past 7 days, except for 2 additional questions on pain which evaluate current pain and pain in the past 24 hours. Each individual symptom scale score, ranging from 0-10 will be summarized. A total symptom score, which will also range from 0-10, will be derived by averaging the 5 individual scale scores that utilize the past 7-day recall period with higher score indicates more severe disease.</description>
