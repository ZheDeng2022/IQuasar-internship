      Open-label, baseline-controlled, multi-center study evaluating a 1060 nm diode laser, pulsed&#xD;
      electromagnetic fields and vacuum assisted radio frequency for non-invasive fat reduction of&#xD;
      the abdomen and flanks. The study will enroll up to 200 subjects requesting non-invasive&#xD;
      lipolysis of the abdomen and flanks. Each subject will receive up to 4 study treatments of&#xD;
      the diode laser and up to 8 treatments of the pulsed electromagnetic fields and vaccum&#xD;
      assisted radio frequency study treatments. Subjects will be followed at twelve weeks post&#xD;
      final diode treatment. Twelve week post treatment outcome will be compared to baseline.&#xD;

    <description>The FDA cleared device (Venus Bliss™) is a non-invasive medical aesthetic device designed for body contouring. The device is comprised of a console, four 1060 nm diode laser applicators (60 mm x 60 mm). A belt is included to allow the operator to secure the laser applicators on the lipolysis treatment area, allowing hands free operation. The device uses vacuum assisted radiofrequency (RF) and PEMF (pulsed electromagnetic field) technology which has been shown in clinical studies to be safe and effective in body circumferential reduction and skin tightening.</description>
