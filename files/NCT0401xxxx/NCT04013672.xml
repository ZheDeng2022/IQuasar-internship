      Primary objective: Assess clinical activity of Pembrolizumab and SurVaxM in participants with&#xD;
      recurrent glioblastoma using progression free survival at 6 months (PFS-6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective: : Assess safety and tolerability of Pembrolizumab and SurVaxM in&#xD;
      participants with recurrent glioblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Phase II study of two arms in participants with recurrent glioblastoma. Arm A will&#xD;
      include participants with first recurrence of glioblastoma who have failed prior chemotherapy&#xD;
      and radiation but have not received any immunotherapy. Arm B is an exploratory arm of 10&#xD;
      participants who have failed prior anti-PD1 therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive the study drug combination consisting of SurVaxM and pembrolizumab&#xD;
      (PEM) with no randomization, stratification or dose escalation.&#xD;
