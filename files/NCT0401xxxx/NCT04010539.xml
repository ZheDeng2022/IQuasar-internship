  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase III, randomized, multicenter, open-label study which will be performed to&#xD;
      evaluate efficacy and safety of oral Gepotidacin compared to intramuscular (IM) ceftriaxone&#xD;
      plus oral azithromycin for the treatment of uncomplicated urogenital infection caused by&#xD;
      Neisseria gonorrhoeae in adolescent and adult subjects. In this study, subjects will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to receive either oral gepotidacin or IM ceftriaxone plus oral&#xD;
      azithromycin. Approximately 600 subjects will be randomized to receive study treatment. The&#xD;
      duration of the study will be approximately 21 days.&#xD;
