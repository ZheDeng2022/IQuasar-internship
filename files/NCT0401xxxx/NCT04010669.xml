  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the present clinical trial is to study the effect of somatostatin in the&#xD;
      regulation of velocity and blood flow of the hepatic circulation in patients undergoing liver&#xD;
      resection. The patients will be randomized in two groups: the study group will receive&#xD;
      somatostatin and the control group will receive the placebo. In both groups, patients will&#xD;
      undergo hepatectomy and directly postoperatively they will receive either somatostatin or&#xD;
      placebo, depending on their randomization. The primary endpoint will be the increase or&#xD;
      decrease of the velocity and the flow of the hepatic circulation estimated by ultrasonography&#xD;
      compared to the same parameters when measured preoperatively.&#xD;

      The purpose of the present clinical trial is to study the effect of somatostatin in the&#xD;
      regulation of blood flow of the portal circulation at patients who have undergone&#xD;
      hepatectomy. The patients will be randomized in two groups, namely the group that will&#xD;
      receive somatostatin (study group) and the group that will receive the placebo (control&#xD;
      group). In both groups, patients will undergo liver resection and directly postoperatively&#xD;
      they will receive either somatostatin (2 amps at 1000ml normal saline solution in continuous&#xD;
      24-hour infusion for 5 days) or a 24 hours infusion of 1000ml Normal Saline solution 0.9%. On&#xD;
      the first, third, fifth and seventh postoperative day, the velocity and the diameter of the&#xD;
      portal vein, splenic vein, hepatic artery and hepatic veins will be measured sonographically&#xD;
      and the flow will be calculated using the following mathematic formula: Flow= velocity x&#xD;
      cross section area (the cross section area of the vessel can be calculated using the&#xD;
      following equation: cross section area=πr2, with 'r' representing the vessel's radius).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperatively&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day before the surgery (day -1),an ultrasound will be performed in order to measure&#xD;
      the velocity and the diameter of the portal vein, splenic vein, hepatic artery and hepatic&#xD;
      veins and the flow will be calculated using the following mathematic formula: Flow= velocity&#xD;
      x cross section area, as stated above. The following data will also be recorded: platelets,&#xD;
      bilirubin (total and direct), albumin, cholesterol, urea, International Normalized Ratio,&#xD;
      sodium, Serum Glutamic Oxaloacetic Transaminase, Serum Glutamic Pyruvic Transaminase,&#xD;
      Alkaline Phosphatase, gamma-Glutamyl Transferase and the Model for End-stage Liver Disease&#xD;
      score of each patient will be calculated. Finally, our patients will undergo a Computer&#xD;
      Tomography scan in order to measure their liver and spleen volumetry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day of the surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day of the surgery (day 0), the following information will be recorded: the type of&#xD;
      the surgical procedure, the duration (in minutes), the presence of ascites, the number of&#xD;
      times and total duration of the a pringle maneuver and finally the percentage of the&#xD;
      resection of the parenchyma will be calculated. A biopsy of healthy liver tissue will be sent&#xD;
      for histological examination in order to determine the presence of fibrosis/cirrhosis and its&#xD;
      stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperatively&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the first, third and fifth postoperative day (day 1, 3, 5), the preoperative blood test&#xD;
      and the ultrasound measurements will be repeated and the amount of fluid in the drain(s) and&#xD;
      inside the abdomen (via ultrasound) will be recorded. Finally, the fluid will be sent for&#xD;
      biochemical examination and culture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the seventh postoperative day (day 7) all blood, fluid and ultrasound measurements will be&#xD;
      repeated and also the liver and spleen volumetry via CT.&#xD;
