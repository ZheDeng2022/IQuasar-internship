  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although antidepressants are the primary treatment for major depression, response and&#xD;
      remission rates are unsatisfactory. The primary objective of this study is to identify if&#xD;
      adding interpersonal group therapy (IPT-G) to the usual psychopharmacological and clinical&#xD;
      management treatment will improve depressive symptoms in major depression outpatients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients presenting a current unipolar depression episode (BDI-II &gt; 18) without response to 2&#xD;
      adequate antidepressants trials (optimized by dose and time) will be randomly allocated to&#xD;
      two arms: a) Treatment-as-usual (TAU) arm: antidepressant + Clinical management; b) Add-on&#xD;
      strategy arm: 14 sessions of IPT-Group added to TAU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IPT-Group will be delivered following manualized guidelines (WHO, 2016 and Stuart et al.&#xD;
      2012). The choice of antidepressants for TAU will be based on the Canadian Network for Mood&#xD;
      and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) recommendations. Clinical management will follow the National&#xD;
      Institute for Mental Health (NIMH) recommendations for clinical management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depression episode will be diagnosed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview&#xD;
      (MINI-PLUS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following variables will be evaluated at baseline and the end of the add-on intervention&#xD;
      in both arms of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      a) depression symptoms- Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II; b) anxiety symptoms - Beck Anxiety&#xD;
      Inventory (BAI); c) quality of life- World Health Organization Quality of life Instrument&#xD;
      short version (WHOQOL-bref); d) social support- Medical Outcomes Study Social. Support Survey&#xD;
      (MOS-SSS); e) resilience- The Brief Resilience Scale (BRS); f) attachment- The Adult&#xD;
      Attachment Scale (AAS-R) Depression symptoms are the primary outcome. Anxiety symptoms and&#xD;
      quality of life the secondary outcomes. Social support, resilience, and attachment will be&#xD;
      considered as both secondary outcome and mediator or moderators in a multivariate model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The database will be built using REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture). Sample size&#xD;
      estimation to detect a 5-point difference between the groups with a standard deviation of 6,&#xD;
      considering Î± = 0,05 and power of 90%, suggests a 64 subjects sample. With the estimation of&#xD;
      a loss of 25% of the sample during the study, 80 patients will be included (40 in each arm).&#xD;
      A trained psychotherapist will conduct five IPT-G groups with eight patients in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design and analysis will use Intention-to-treat analysis. For quantitative variables&#xD;
      testing, student-T test t (normal distribution) or Mann Whitney (absence of normal&#xD;
      distribution) will be used with a 5% level of significance. Categorical variables will be&#xD;
      tested using the Chi-square with exact Fischer test with a 5% level of significance.&#xD;
      Hierarchical linear regression will be used to determine the variables that could predict a&#xD;
      reduction in the depression scores of the BDI-II. All analysis will be performed using the&#xD;
      Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20.0.&#xD;
