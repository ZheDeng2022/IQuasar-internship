  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational, prospective, consecutively enrolled, single-arm, multi-site&#xD;
      registry of the use of the DABRA Laser System and other medical devices intended for&#xD;
      endovascular treatment of peripheral artery disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study covers the use of endovascular devices including the DABRA Laser System and other&#xD;
      devices commercially used in the United States for the treatment of lower extremity PAD.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Participant presents with a Rutherford category of 2 to 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has at least one peripheral lesion, ≤ 140mm, in a native vessel that is&#xD;
             treated successfully with DABRA Laser System.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant is able and willing to be anti-coagulated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability and willingness of participant to give written informed consent and comply&#xD;
             with follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant, breastfeeding, planning to become pregnant - If women of reproductive&#xD;
             capability will be enrolled, status will be assessed via pregnancy testing. Subject&#xD;
             must agree to use effective birth control measures for duration of study. Pregnancy&#xD;
             during study must be reported immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Endovascular interventions within 90 days prior to study enrollment (on leg to be&#xD;
             treated).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in another cardiovascular or peripheral vascular study that might, in&#xD;
             the judgement of the Investigator, affect the results of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Disorders or allergies precluding use of radiographic contrast including renal&#xD;
             insufficiency severe enough to contraindicate use of radiographic contrast.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability or unwillingness of the patient to comply with study examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Necrosis necessitating major amputation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has an anticipated life span of less than one (1) year.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Medically non-compliant subjects, based on Investigator judgment (e.g., subject is&#xD;
             non-compliant in following medical advice regarding blood pressure medication,&#xD;
             cholesterol medication, and/or maintenance of healthy blood sugar levels).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No run-off vessel is present when treating above the knee. A run-off vessel is&#xD;
             required when treating above the knee, however, it is not required when treating below&#xD;
             the knee.&#xD;
