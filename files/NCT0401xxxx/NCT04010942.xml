      This study is determining the therapeutic effect of Vitamin D supplements to Pcos clomiphene&#xD;
      resistant polycystic ovarian syndrome Women. Half of patients will receive Vitamin D with&#xD;
      metformin while other half metformin only. Then both groups start clomiphene for 3 month&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is considered one of the most common endocrine disorders&#xD;
      affecting women in their reproductive age. Genetically it is thought to be involving defects&#xD;
      in primary cellular control mechanisms resulting in expression of chronic anovulation and&#xD;
      androgen excess. Being familial condition , some researches showed it is autosomal dominant&#xD;
      while others thought it is complex trait with oligogenic basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosing poly cystic ovary syndrome is based on finding two of three criteria according to&#xD;
      Rotterdam consensus 2003 : oligo/anovulation, clinical/ biochemical signs of&#xD;
      hyperandrogenism, ultrasound finding of polycystic ovaries. While insulin resistance which&#xD;
      affects 50 - 70 % of PCOS patients is considered to be the main reason for hyperandrogenic&#xD;
      features, PCOS also leads to various health problems including metabolic disorders (obesity -&#xD;
      Diabetes Mellitus - Cardiovascular diseases) in addition to menstrual irregularities and&#xD;
      infertility .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In PCOS women there is polymorphism in Vitamin-D receptor (VDR) gene associated with vitamin&#xD;
      D level in blood . This gene is isolated from the female reproductive organs . In VDR null&#xD;
      mice; uterine hypoplasia, impaired folliculogenesis and infertility is noted . That's why it&#xD;
      is thought to be contributing in the genomic regulation of reproduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have investigated the effectiveness of Vitamin D supplementation to PCOS&#xD;
      women they found that PCOS women have hypovitaminosis D3 , with increasing evidence that&#xD;
      vitamin D affects insulin and glucose metabolism . vitamin D intake in PCOS women may improve&#xD;
      hormonal profiles in addition to having anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effects . Another&#xD;
      study concluded that Vitamin D and calcium supplementation to PCOS women have a positive&#xD;
      effect on BMI, follicular maturation, regularity of menses, androgen related symptoms,&#xD;
      infertility and insulin resistance . Moreover, Vitamin D has a crucial role in ovulation&#xD;
      induction in women with PCOS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitamin D and calcium in combination with metformin have significant effect on menstrual&#xD;
      regulation and follicular development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insulin sensitizers such as metformin have been extensively investigated in the management of&#xD;
      PCOS. Metformin decreases blood glucose levels by enhancing peripheral glucose uptake,&#xD;
      decreasing intestinal glucose absorption and suppressing hepatic glucose levels. In&#xD;
      anovulatory women with PCOS, metformin decreases insulin levels, luteinizing hormone (LH)&#xD;
      production and circulating androgen levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clomiphene citrate is an estrogen agonist and antagonist. It works by competitively binding&#xD;
      estrogen receptors in the thalamus and as it remains in place for an extended period of time,&#xD;
      it depletes the body's estrogen concentration at the hypothalamic level. As the body&#xD;
      perceives low levels of estrogen, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is released which in&#xD;
      turn stimulates pituitary release of follicle stimulating hormone ( FSH) which promotes&#xD;
      follicular growth and maturation. If pregnancy is not achieved by 3-6 cycles, other&#xD;
      treatments should be considered.&#xD;
