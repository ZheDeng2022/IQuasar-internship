      Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) have remained the leading cause of death globally for the last&#xD;
      15 years. Considering that advancing age is the primary risk factor for CVD, an increasingly&#xD;
      aging population is expected to result in unprecedented levels of CVD. It therefore remains&#xD;
      crucial to develop effective prevention or treatment strategies to reduce the impending&#xD;
      health and economic burden of CVD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise is arguably the best intervention for the prevention and/or treatment of CVD. A key&#xD;
      adaptation underlying the cardiovascular benefits of exercise is to offset and reverse&#xD;
      age-related reductions in vascular function. Studies have demonstrated, at least in men, that&#xD;
      active older adults demonstrate preserved vascular function relative to their sedentary peers&#xD;
      and that exercise training interventions improve vascular function in previously sedentary&#xD;
      older adults. However, these studies have almost exclusively been performed in men. In&#xD;
      contrast, the few studies performed in older women consistently demonstrate that active women&#xD;
      do not demonstrate preserved vascular function relative to their sedentary peers and that&#xD;
      exercise training interventions do not improve vascular function in previously sedentary&#xD;
      women. This observation has been attributed to the loss of oestrogens that accompanies&#xD;
      menopause. Although the mechanisms have not been fully elicited, it is possible that the loss&#xD;
      of oestrogens desensitizes the endothelium to the physiological stimuli that result in&#xD;
      improved vascular function with exercise training. Indeed, exercise improves vascular&#xD;
      function in previously sedentary older women when it is combined with oestrogen replacement.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, chronic oestrogen replacement therapy is not a viable intervention as it is&#xD;
      associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. Alternative solutions to restore the&#xD;
      beneficial effects of exercise on vascular function in post-menopausal women are thus&#xD;
      urgently needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall objective of this project is to determine if folic acid, an over-the-counter&#xD;
      supplement that has been shown to provide beneficial vascular adaptations, can be used to&#xD;
      improve vascular function in post-menopausal women. It is hypothesized that folic acid will&#xD;
      improve blood vessel function in post-menopausal women and age-matched males.&#xD;
