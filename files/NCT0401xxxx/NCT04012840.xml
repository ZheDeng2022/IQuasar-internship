      As an active and healthy ageing, &quot;Successful Ageing&quot; is a societal challenge for all&#xD;
      countries members according to the European Commission. This study is intended to contribute&#xD;
      to increase healthy, active and non-dependent lifetime. To this end the main goal is to&#xD;
      highlight clinical and biological frailty determinants in elderly with potential weaknesses.&#xD;

      Detailed Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition: Extended description of the protocol, including more technical information (as&#xD;
      compared to the Brief Summary) if desired. Do not include the entire protocol; do not&#xD;
      duplicate information recorded in other data elements, such as eligibility criteria or&#xD;
      outcome measures. (Limit: 32,000 characters)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Example:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sudden out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OOH-CA) remains a significant cause of death, in spite&#xD;
      of recent declines in overall mortality from cardiovascular disease. Existing methods of&#xD;
      emergency resuscitation are inadequate due to time delays inherent in the transport of a&#xD;
      trained responder with defibrillation capabilities to the side of the OOH-CA victim. Existing&#xD;
      Emergency Medical Services (EMS) systems typically combine paramedic Emergency Medical&#xD;
      Technician (EMT) services with some level of community involvement, such as bystander&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) training. Some communities include automated external&#xD;
      defibrillators (AEDs) at isolated sites or in mobile police or fire vehicles. A&#xD;
      comprehensive, integrated community approach to treatment with AEDs would have community&#xD;
      units served by these volunteer non-medical responders who can quickly identify and treat a&#xD;
      patient with OOH-CA. Such an approach is termed Public Access Defibrillation (PAD). Healthy,&#xD;
      active and non-dependent lifetime during ageing is a societal challenge for European Union.&#xD;
      One of the worst consequences of ageing is the loss of autonomy which may be preceded by a&#xD;
      mid-state between good and pathological ageing. This mid-state is called &quot;frailty syndrome&quot;&#xD;
      and cause a lot of hospitalizations (Morley et al., 2013). This statement is potentially&#xD;
      reversible if early procedures mixing geriatric interventions based on standardised geriatric&#xD;
      evaluation and general practitioners cooperation are established (Haute Autorité de Santé,&#xD;
      2013). The main studied interventions are physical training, cognitive stimulation and&#xD;
      nutritional actions (Bibas et al., 2014; Clegg et al., 2013). Frailty syndrome is a geriatric&#xD;
      syndrome emphasizes by the homeostatic reserves drop which induces a stress response failure&#xD;
      and expose the person to a wrong medical prognosis (Clegg et al., 2013; Rodriguez-Manas et&#xD;
      al., 2013; Rolland et al., 2011). Its clinical expression is modulated by comorbidities and&#xD;
      psychological, social, economic and behavioural factors. Thus, frailty syndrome is a&#xD;
      mortality risk and pejorative events factor, especially those of loss of autonomy, falls,&#xD;
      hospitalizations and institutionalization in a 1 to 3 years delay. So, the main goal is to&#xD;
      highlight clinical and biological frailty determinants in elderly with potential weaknesses.&#xD;
      If there is no strict frailty definition, two frailty criteria types are officially used :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Fried's criteria are the more commonly used criteria to diagnose frailty (Fried et al.,&#xD;
           2001):&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Involuntary weight loss &gt; 4.5 kg in one year,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A feeling of exhaustion,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Low muscle strength (handgrip &lt;20% norm for age, sex and self- bmi),&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Low physical activity (&lt;383 kcal/week spent for men, &lt;270kcal/week for women)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Low walking speed (&lt;0.8m/s). According to the number of Fried's criteria, subjects&#xD;
                are considered frail (≥ 3 criteria), pre-frail (1-2 criteria) or robust (0&#xD;
                criterion).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Rockwood (Rockwood et al., 2005) or Winograd's criteria (Winograd et al., 1988) based on&#xD;
           the mix of medical and social factors also known as &quot;multidomain frailty&quot; incorporate&#xD;
           additional pattern of comorbidities (70 parameters in Rockwood's criteria) and geriatric&#xD;
           syndromes (confusion, dementia, bed sores, falls, malnourishment…) which actually are&#xD;
           too general and leading to detect patients too late.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To diagnose and evaluate this frailty a global geriatric evaluation based on the&#xD;
      multidimensional comprehensive geriatric assessment (Haute Autorité de Santé, 2013) must be&#xD;
      led, which is a long process specifically realized in geriatrics. Due to several limits in&#xD;
      both Fried' and Rockwood's criterion. In Fried's model the slow of walking speed is hard to&#xD;
      evaluate, the exhaustion of the patient can depend on a previous psychological state (Drey et&#xD;
      al., 2011), also the measure of muscle strength which requires a dynamometer is not always&#xD;
      achievable for example. Likewise, in Rockwood's criteria the whole 70 variables are too long&#xD;
      to list, even under its short form which includes 30 variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, since there is no easy-to-use consensual tool, the real frailty in elderly is nowadays&#xD;
      rarely detected. Yet it remains essential to identify the mains biological or clinical&#xD;
      factors which will forecast the loss of autonomy. The highlighting of those factors would&#xD;
      allow an earlier screening in order to propose several interventions to delay the loss of&#xD;
      autonomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non interventional and prospective study in which recruitment and frailty evaluation will be&#xD;
      realized in a special geriatric ward (medical examination in day hospital and preventive&#xD;
      center). This study bases its choice of patient on the results of a 6 questions survey (from&#xD;
      the Gérontopôle of Toulouse) about frailty.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The main objective is to highlight the clinical and biological determinants of loss of&#xD;
           autonomy in non-dependent and potentially frail elderly.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondaries objectives are to highlight the clinical and biological determinants of loss&#xD;
           of autonomy in non-dependent and potentially frail elderly by testing :&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cognitive disorders;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Risk of falls;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Malnourishment;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Depression;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  New illnesses appearances;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Unscheduled hospitalizations;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Mortality;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Institutionalization;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the impact of the geriatrician subjective impression on the loss of autonomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People will be recruited among patients whose consult in prevention centers and day hospitals&#xD;
      in Île-de-France :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  8 geriatric centers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2000 patients will be included over 36 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Approximatively 7 patients per week in each center&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inclusions will take place for 3 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A following up call every 6 months for 3 years&#xD;
