      The primary research question: In critically ill patients with nutrition 'risk factors', what&#xD;
      is the effect of providing combined EN/PN to the group prescribed a higher dose (≥2.2&#xD;
      grams/kg/day) of protein/amino acid administration compared to a low group prescribed ≤1.2&#xD;
      gram/kg/day (EN only) on patient's functional recovery as measured by 6-minute walk distance&#xD;
      just prior to hospital discharge? The hypothesis: Compared to a control group reflective of&#xD;
      usual care prescribing practices and an EN only approach, the administration of a higher dose&#xD;
      protein/amino acids using EN and PN to nutritionally high-risk critically ill patients will&#xD;
      be associated with improved functional outcome.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Positive, neutral, or negative, the results of the EFFORTcombo study will inform the clinical&#xD;
      practice in ICU settings around the world. If positive, because of the pragmatic, multicentre&#xD;
      nature of this trial, results will be broadly applicable to all critically ill patients&#xD;
      worldwide. If the results are negative, it will be ensured that patients no longer receive&#xD;
      high-dose protein/amino acid admixtures or possibly, combined EN/PN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As it relates to critical care nutrition practice in general, there is a long history of&#xD;
      practice-changing initiatives. A process of synthesizing (in the form of evidence-based&#xD;
      clinical practice guidelines) and disseminating best practice ideas (in the form of web-based&#xD;
      repository of tools and information [see www.criticalcarenutrition.com]) was established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the past several years, this program of research with leaders of the American Society of&#xD;
      Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN) and this specific protocol at the annual Clinical&#xD;
      Nutrition Week with society leaders, researchers, and the clinical nutrition community at&#xD;
      large has been discussed. Partnership with ASPEN will further facilitate both, recruitment&#xD;
      initiatives and, importantly, the knowledge translation initiatives. These efforts will&#xD;
      increase the likelihood of the uptake of EFFORT results across the world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has both the potential to answer a high-priority clinical question and also&#xD;
      transform the new approach in clinical nutrition research. It further represents a unique&#xD;
      collaboration between ASPEN, its global partners, and the Clinical Evaluation Research Unit,&#xD;
      a methodological support center based in Kingston, Ontario, Canada and managed by Dr. Daren&#xD;
      Heyland. If successful, this type of collaboration sets an important precedent for how this&#xD;
      community may approach additional research questions related to clinical nutrition. Nested&#xD;
      within this larger volunteer-driven registry trial, the aim is to complete a significant&#xD;
      sub-study that will establish the role of combined EN/PN in these nutritionally high-risk&#xD;
      patients. This protocol pertains to the specifics of this sub-study of combined EN/PN. At the&#xD;
      end of the trial, the data from this sub-study will be merged into the results of the overall&#xD;
      parent EFFORT Trial (where data points are similar).&#xD;
