  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Shoulder impingement syndrome is the most common shoulder disorder in overhead athletes. It&#xD;
      describes a mechanical compression of subacromial bursa and rotator cuff tendons during arm&#xD;
      movement, which results in pain and injuries. Most of previous studies focus on investigating&#xD;
      motor performance in individuals with shoulder impingement syndrome and found altered&#xD;
      scapular kinematics and muscle activation may contribute to the impingement. Recently few&#xD;
      studies found changes in the central nervous system, decreases in corticospinal excitability&#xD;
      and increases in inhibition in scapular muscles, by using transcranial magnetic stimulation&#xD;
      (TMS). Although more studies are still needed to investigate the changes in central nervous&#xD;
      system in the individuals with impingement syndrome, the changes in central nervous system&#xD;
      are believed to be associated with the deficits of impingement syndrome. However, the&#xD;
      exercise protocols for the impingement syndrome are usually designed to restore scapular&#xD;
      kinematics and muscle activation, including scapular muscle strengthening exercise and&#xD;
      scapular control exercise. To our knowledge, no study has investigated whether these exercise&#xD;
      protocols can reverse these changes in the corticospinal system. The objectives of this&#xD;
      proposal are to understand neuromuscular and neurophysiological mechanisms of the&#xD;
      scapula-focused exercise protocols to improve the effectiveness of treatment. The study aims&#xD;
      to investigate the effects of scapular muscle strengthening training and scapular control&#xD;
      training on the scapular kinematics, muscle activation and corticospinal system. The study&#xD;
      also aims to investigate whether any other cortical mechanisms are also affected by the&#xD;
      shoulder impingement syndrome. We will recruit 70 overhead athletes with shoulder impingement&#xD;
      syndrome and 22 healthy control athletes. Subjects with shoulder impingement syndrome will&#xD;
      randomly receive either scapular muscle strengthening or scapular control training. When&#xD;
      performing the exercise, subjects in the scapular control training group will receive&#xD;
      electromyography feedback and cues but those in the strengthening training group will not.&#xD;
      Immediate effects of these two training protocols on scapular kinematics, muscle activation,&#xD;
      and neurophysiological measures will be tested before and after the training.&#xD;
      Neurophysiological measures will be tested by TMS, including corticospinal excitability,&#xD;
      cortical inhibition, intracortical inhibition, and intracortical facilitation.&#xD;
