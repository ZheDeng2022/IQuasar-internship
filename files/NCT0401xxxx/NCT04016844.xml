  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to examine the efficacy of tDCS to improving walking in people with Multiple&#xD;
      Sclerosis (PwMS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study compromises 1 group of subjects with MS which will attend the lab for three&#xD;
      sessions. In the first session, subjects will be consented, complete the Patient Determined&#xD;
      Disease Steps (PDDS), the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), and maximal voluntary contractions&#xD;
      (MVCs) of the right and left knee extensors and flexors to determine the more-affected leg.&#xD;
      The second and third sessions will involve whole-body FDG PET imaging. During each of these&#xD;
      sessions, the subject will walk for 20 min on a treadmill at a self-selected speed during&#xD;
      which time tDCS or SHAM, in a blinded manner, will be applied to the motor cortex (M1)&#xD;
      corresponding to the more-affected leg. Approximately 2 minutes into the walking,&#xD;
      [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) will be administered by IV injection. Immediately after the&#xD;
      walking is completed, the subject will be positioned in the PET/CT scanner and a whole body&#xD;
      (top of head to toes) PET/CT scan will be acquired for the evaluation of glucose metabolism&#xD;
      in the brain, spine, and lower extremities. The third session will be identical to the second&#xD;
      session with the exception that the opposite condition (tDCS or SHAM) will be used.&#xD;

      Prospective participants, men and women with MS, will be recruited. The plan is to enroll up&#xD;
      to 30 to get 20 evaluable subjects. To accomplish this study, all participants will need to&#xD;
      complete 3 sessions. The first session at the INPL and sessions 2 and 3 at PET Imaging Center&#xD;
      (0911ZJPP) and the PET Imaging lab in Pappajohn Biomedical Discovery Building. Session 2 and&#xD;
      3 are separated by 5-8 days. The duration of each session will be approximately 120 minutes.&#xD;
      We expect data collection to last 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first session, subjects will be consented, complete the PDDS, the Fatigue Severity&#xD;
      Scale (FSS), and maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs) of the right and left knee extensors&#xD;
      and flexors to determine the more-affected leg. When leg strength difference is less than&#xD;
      10%, the more affected side will be based on self-report. The second and the third sessions&#xD;
      will involve 20 min walking on a treadmill at a self-selected speed during which time tDCS or&#xD;
      SHAM will be applied to the motor cortex (M1) corresponding to the more-affected leg and&#xD;
      [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose will be administered. At the end of the walking period, the subject&#xD;
      will be imaged on a PET/CT scanner from top of head to toes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to sessions 2 and 3, all subjects will be asked to fast (water and medication can be&#xD;
      taken during this time) for a minimum of 6 hours prior to the FDG administration. In&#xD;
      addition, the blood glucose level will be checked (via Accuchek) prior to FDG administration&#xD;
      and the level must be equal to or less than 200 mg/dL in order to proceed with the FDG&#xD;
      administration on that day. At the beginning of session 2 and 3, the subject will be weighed&#xD;
      and height measured, have a blood glucose level determined via Accuchek as described above,&#xD;
      undergo a urine pregnancy test if the subject is of child-bearing potential, and have an IV&#xD;
      catheter inserted for FDG administration. The subject will then be moved to the PET Scanner&#xD;
      area in Pappajohn Biomedical Discovery Building. The subject will be asked to use the&#xD;
      restroom prior to walking on the treadmill. A tDCS device (Soterix) will deliver a small&#xD;
      direct current through two sponge surface electrodes (5cm × 5cm, soaked with 15 mM NaCl). The&#xD;
      positive electrode will be placed over the motor cortex representation of the more affected&#xD;
      leg, and a second electrode will be placed on the forehead above the contralateral orbit. The&#xD;
      participant will receive tDCS or SHAM throughout the walking (i.e., for 20 min). In the tDCS&#xD;
      trial, the intensity will start at 0 mA and will increase to 3 mA over the first 30 seconds.&#xD;
      In the sham condition, the participants will receive the initial 30 seconds of stimulation,&#xD;
      after which the current will be set to 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two min into the walking test on the treadmill, 10 mCi of [18F]-FDG will be injected IV.&#xD;
      Then, the walking test continues until 20 min is reached. When the walking test is completed,&#xD;
      the tDCS device will be removed and the subject will be positioned in the PET/CT scanner and&#xD;
      a whole body (top of head to toes) PET/CT scan will be acquired.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) will be recorded with the modified Borg 10-point scale&#xD;
      (Borg, 1982). The subjects will be instructed to estimate the effort during walking. The&#xD;
      scale will be anchored so that 0 denotes the resting state and 10 represents the strongest&#xD;
      effort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No long-term follow-up will be done.&#xD;
