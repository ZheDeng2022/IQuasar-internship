  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D), the number of patients requiring combination&#xD;
      therapy of oral antidiabetic agents (OADs) is more than 70%. Especially in Korea, the&#xD;
      tendency to avoid insulin therapy is relatively higher than other countries, therefore, the&#xD;
      need for combination therapy of OADs is quite high. However, according to the current&#xD;
      guidelines, clinicians are recommended to prescribe three or fewer OADs as the combination&#xD;
      therapy for T2D. Recently, various OADs have been developed, and it is expected that&#xD;
      quadruple combination therapy of OADs would be quite effective to lower blood glucose levels.&#xD;
      In the present study, the investigators designed the study to compare the efficacy and safety&#xD;
      of quadruple combination therapy; thiazolidinedione (TZD) vs. SGLT-2 inhibitor as an add-on&#xD;
      therapy to triple combination therapy (Metformin, Sulfonylurea, Dipeptidyl peptidase-4(DPP-4)&#xD;
      inhibitors). Quadruple combination therapy group with the SGLT-2 inhibitor will be considered&#xD;
      as active control group, because it have shown non-inferior glycemic efficacy to the&#xD;
      conventional insulin conversion therapy in a previous clinical study. Patients who could not&#xD;
      achieve the target blood glucose level (7% &lt;HbA1c ≤ 10%) under the triple combination therapy&#xD;
      (Metformin, Sulfonylurea, DPP-4 inhibitors) for more than 12 weeks will be enrolled in this&#xD;
      prospective, open-label, randomized, parallel comparison, multicenter clinical trial.&#xD;
      Subjects in each group (60 patients/group) will be treated with TZD-containing quadruple&#xD;
      therapy or SGLT-2 inhibitor-containing quadruple therapy for 24 weeks. The investigators will&#xD;
      evaluate the glycemic efficacy and safety of each group. Primary outcome is the 24&#xD;
      week-change of HbA1c from baseline levels.&#xD;
