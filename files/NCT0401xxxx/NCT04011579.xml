  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To date, despite recent advances in MS care including rehabilitation interventions, many PwMS&#xD;
      are unable to access these developments due to limited mobility, fatigue and related issues,&#xD;
      and costs associated with travel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, physical activity at home could be a new way to deliver exercises to the patients.&#xD;
      Although Pilates did not show any significant advantage over standardized physical therapy in&#xD;
      the current literature, it is a good method to promote physical activity, sensorimotor&#xD;
      integration and cognitive stimulation. Thus, it could be a treatment option to improve&#xD;
      fatigue, balance and walking abilities in PwMS; consequently, Pilates could be suggested by&#xD;
      the clinician as a physical activity to be integrated in the daily life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This possibility could be made more feasible using new tools such as those offered by low&#xD;
      cost devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main MS-FIT project purposes are to provide and to test a tool based on serious game&#xD;
      concept of Pilates-inspired exercises for daily use at home, by mixing the entertainment&#xD;
      aspects typical of the videogames and the possibility to perform physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MS-FIT tool does not pursue therapeutic aims as rehabilitation does, but it could have a&#xD;
      positive impact on prevention and health in MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MS-FIT, by using the Microsoft Kinect Motion Controller Xbox or similar to deliver adapted&#xD;
      physical activity, offers the possibility to transform the Pilates exercises into a virtual&#xD;
      reality game.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MS-FIT, through a multicentre approach, would provide:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a feasibility study in order to:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  refine the tool for the final customized version to be used in a RCT MS study&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  assess the tool for PwMS in terms of technology acceptability and&#xD;
                satisfaction-to-use&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  assess the process of recruitment, the adherence to the intervention, the dropout&#xD;
                rate and identify potential issues&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  assess human resources necessary for the RCT&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  estimate the effect of the intervention and its variance necessary to calculate the&#xD;
                appropriate sample size for the RCT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a RCT study in order to evaluate the effect of a physical activity intervention of&#xD;
           exercises inspired to Pilates self-managed at home in terms on PwMS&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Devices and technologies for at-home interventions could provide to PwMS with mild disability&#xD;
      useful tools to successfully maintain own physical, cognitive and emotional status by&#xD;
      performing at-home physical activity/exercises and avoiding outpatient interventions.&#xD;
      Together, new devices and technologies could help in overcoming all barriers (i.e.&#xD;
      transportations, working time, etc.) hindering the adherence to and, consequently, efficacy&#xD;
      of the outpatient treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although Pilates did not show any significant advantage over standardized physical therapy in&#xD;
      the current literature, it is a good method to promote physical activity, sensorimotor&#xD;

&#xD;
      MS-FIT, through a multicentre approach, would provide:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Feasibility study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  RCT study&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the 14 participating centres will select a dedicated therapist who will be responsible&#xD;
      for patient training in using the MS-FIT tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the subjects recruited following the inclusion/exclusion criteria will sign an informed&#xD;
      consent and all the procedures (feasibility and RCT) will be in agreement with the&#xD;
      Declaration of Helsinki (1964) and approved by Local Ethical Committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No trial-specific procedures will be conducted before informed consent has been obtained, and&#xD;
      participants will be reminded that they may withdraw from the trial at any time without it&#xD;
      affecting the quality of their care in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with relapses during the period of their involvement in the project will be&#xD;
      considered as drop out and will be considered in the analysis for the entire period of study&#xD;
      participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ the refinement of the tool for the final customized version to be used in a RCT MS study.&#xD;
      The primary objective will be reached by fixing eventual bugs relieved during the feasibility&#xD;
      study and taking into account results from the assessment in terms of technology&#xD;
      acceptability and satisfaction-to-use, adherence to the intervention, intervention safety and&#xD;
      the physical effects of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the estimation of human resources necessary for the RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the estimation of the effect of the intervention and its variance necessary to calculate&#xD;
           the appropriate sample size for the RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the nature of the feasibility study and based on previous literature showing that a&#xD;
      sample size of 25-40 subjects per arm is adequate for a feasibility trial, the investigators&#xD;
      will recruit 28 PwMS per arm. All the 14 participating centres will recruit a total of 56&#xD;
      recruited patients following the inclusion and exclusion criteria. In the range of EDSS&#xD;
      inclusion criteria 28 subjects will be recruited with lower disability (EDSS 2-3) and 28 with&#xD;
      higher disability (EDSS of 3.5 or 4). For both levels the subjects will be randomized into&#xD;
      two groups: MSFITFeas (MS-FIT at-home + &quot;unspecific physical activities&quot;) and CTRLFeas&#xD;
      (&quot;unspecific physical activities&quot;). Randomization will be provided by an independent&#xD;
      randomization service at FISM accessed via a web-based system, using computer-based block&#xD;
      randomization (1 factor: EDSS score 2-3 and 3.5-4). Patient will be allocated to MSFITFeas&#xD;
      and CTRLFeas in a 1:1 ratio. Confirmation emails will be sent to Centres PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MSFITFeas group will self-manage MS-FIT at-home for 6 weeks, performing at least 3&#xD;
      sessions/week for a total of 30 minutes of exercises (also distributed during the day with a&#xD;
      minimum slot of 10 minutes) for each session. During this period Xbox One and Microsoft&#xD;
      Kinect 2.0 will be delivered to the participants for the aims of the study. Before starting&#xD;
      the at-home intervention each subject will be trained to the use of the platform by a&#xD;
      therapist. No rehabilitative interventions except sphincter and speech rehabilitation and&#xD;
      psychological support, are admitted for the 6 weeks of participation to the project. The&#xD;
      execution of unspecific physical activities, if not already practiced, will be suggested to&#xD;
      the participants. For the 6 weeks of participation to the project CTRLFeas will be similar to&#xD;
      MSFITFeas group except for the execution of MS-FIT at-home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol for the Feasibility study will consist on (Figure 2):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T0 evaluation (PRE)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  6 weeks of intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  MSFITFeas: unspecific physical activities + MS-FIT at-home&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  CTRLFeas: unspecific physical activities&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T1 evaluation (POST)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation for the Feasibility study are described in the section Outcome Measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deliverables Deliverables of the Feasibility study will be the final customized tool, a set&#xD;
      of indications for the management of the RCT, the sample size estimation for the RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Focus group A nested qualitative study on 14 participants will explore patients' experiences&#xD;
      of MS-FIT via Focus Group Meeting (FGM). The objectives are to provide insight into the&#xD;
      quantitative results, explore strengths and limitations of the intervention with MS-FIT, so&#xD;
      as to guide the RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The report of each FGM analysis will be submitted to FGM participants for review (respondent&#xD;
      validation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deliverables Deliverables of the nested qualitative study will be the delivery of the report&#xD;
      of the FGM analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RCT study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ evaluation of the change in TUG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  evaluation of the physical effects also in terms of self-reported outcome, upper limb&#xD;
           performances, resistance in walking and physical activity, cognitive and psychosocial&#xD;
           effects, quality of life and wellbeing. Differences in physical and cognitive&#xD;
           performances due to the genetic features will be evaluated also considering subgroups&#xD;
           identified through the polymorphism analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  evaluation of the acceptability and satisfaction-to-use, adherence to the intervention,&#xD;
           intervention safety through the measurements of endpoint already listed for the&#xD;
           Feasibility study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RCT sample size will be definitively calculated based on the results from the feasibility&#xD;
      study. However, by considering the literature about Pilates in MS, the investigators can&#xD;
      preliminary estimate the needed sample size. In particular, the investigators refer to the&#xD;
      TUG post-intervention improvement found by Karlon et al. in a group of PwMS performing&#xD;
      Pilates. For our aim, the investigators can consider this result even if no differences&#xD;
      between Pilates group and control group (Physiotherapy) were found. Pilates group improved&#xD;
      the performance in TUG of about 1.8s, that could be considered as clinically relevant for&#xD;
      PwMS. By considering a variability of about 3.4s, a power of 80%, a level of significance&#xD;
      (two sided) of 5% and a potential loss of 15% of patients at follow-up, the estimation of the&#xD;
      necessary sample size consists of approximately 63 subjects for the experimental group (a&#xD;
      total of 126).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the 14 participating centres will be involved in the patients' enrolment. The subjects&#xD;
      will be randomized into two groups: MSFITRCT (MS-FIT at-home + &quot;unspecific physical&#xD;
      activities&quot;) and CTRLRCT (&quot;unspecific physical activities&quot;). The randomization will be&#xD;
      carried out using a web based procedure and will be centrally managed. A stratified&#xD;
      minimization/adaptive algorithm will be used in order to balance the baseline EDSS (2-3 vs&#xD;
      3.5-4) factors across the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MSFITRCT group will self-manage MS-FIT at-home for 12 weeks, performing at least 3&#xD;
      sessions/week for a total of 30 minutes of exercises (also distributed during the day with a&#xD;
      minimum slot of 10 minutes) for each session. During this period Xbox One and Microsoft&#xD;
      Kinect 2.0 will be delivered to the participants for the aims of the study. Before starting&#xD;
      the at-home intervention each subject will be trained to the use of the platform by a&#xD;
      therapist. The follow-up (FU) evaluation will be after 6 weeks since the end of the&#xD;
      intervention. No rehabilitative interventions except sphincter and speech rehabilitation and&#xD;
      psychological support, are admitted for the 18 (12 + 6) weeks of participation to the&#xD;
      project. The execution of unspecific physical activities, if not already practiced, will be&#xD;
      suggested to the participants. For the 18 (12 + 6) weeks of participation to the project&#xD;
      CTRLFeas will be similar to MSFITFeas group except for the execution of MS-FIT at-home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the 18 weeks, the participants of the CTRLRCT group will be offered the MS-FIT&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The requirement that the enrolled patients will have not to perform any supervised physical&#xD;
      activity or rehabilitative intervention is in line with recent studies showing that most of&#xD;
      PwMS with mild disability (78.34% EDSS &lt;4) were not treated with rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects involved in the feasibility study will be excluded from the RCT study in order&#xD;
      to avoid bias effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol design for the RCT study will consist on (Figure 3):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T0 evaluation (PRE)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  12 weeks of intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  MSFITRCT: unspecific physical activities + MS-FIT at-home&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  CTRLRCT: unspecific physical activities&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T1 evaluation (POST)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T2 evaluation (FU) - after 6 weeks from T1&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation for the RCT study are described in the section Outcome Measures. Moreover,&#xD;
      blood samples will be collected at T0 to investigate if genetic polymorphisms of candidate&#xD;
      regulators of neuronal plasticity could be correlated to the response to the proposed&#xD;
      protocol. According to previous report MS subjects of the two RCT groups could be subdivided&#xD;
      in subgroups with respect to the polymorphism features. For example, for the CNR1 gene the&#xD;
      subdivision could be based on the number of AAT repetitions (short AAT: homozygous or&#xD;
      heterozygous for allele with â‰¤11 repeats of AAT triplets; long AAT: homozygous for allele&#xD;
      with â‰¥12 repeats of AAT triplets).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Differences among subgroups in terms of physical and cognitive performances will be&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In particular, all patients will be genotyped for a total of 55 genetic polymorphisms of 23&#xD;
      potential regulators, like: Homer1; AKT1; RAPTOR; D2R; GAPD; CHAT; p53; BRCA2; LIG4; XRCC5;&#xD;
      CYP3A4; NBS1; MDM2; CNR1, ATTn; CNR2; GRIN1; GRIN2B; TRPV1; FAAH, COMPT; (Brain-derived&#xD;
      neurotrophic factor) BDNF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood sample will be assessed from participants early in the morning after awakening (8h). To&#xD;
      synchronize the sample for lifestyle variables, subjects were requested to avoid excessive&#xD;
      physical activity the last three days before the blood sampling, sleep for 7-8h the night&#xD;
      before study, avoid starving, and eat a usual breakfast in the morning (approximately 1h&#xD;
      before the time of the breakfast).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The samples will be collected by each participant centre and shipped to the IRCCS Neuromed,&#xD;
      Pozzilli, Isernia (Prof. Diego Centonze) for the analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deliverables Deliverables will be the report of the results of the trial and the final&#xD;
      guidelines to make available and easy-to-use the MS-FIT tool&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for Premature Withdrawal&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for the premature withdrawal are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients withdrawal of the consent anytime;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Any medical conditions that the investigator determines jeopardize the patient's safety&#xD;
           if she/he continues the study and/or study results;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patient's no-compliance to complete the study procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. MS Treatment changes during the study&#xD;

In VLMT the examiner reads aloud and consecutively the 15 words to the participant who in return has to recall as many words as possible. This procedure is repeated 5 times. The sum score is the number of correctly recalled words. In BVMT subjects have to encode 6 geometrical figures and memorize their precise location during presentation of 10s. Immediately afterwards, subjects have to draw the memorized figures in the right location. The procedure is repeated 3 times. Depending on figure and exact location accuracy, a scoring from 0 to 2 points for each figure is given. The total recall score is the sum of the three trials.</description>

    <measure>Change in Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) with a 7-points scale</measure>
    <time_frame>T1: after 12 weeks of intervention; T2: 6 weeks after T1</time_frame>
    <description>The self-report measure Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) reflects a patient's belief about the efficacy of treatment. PGIC is a 7 point scale depicting a patient's rating of overall improvement. It has the options &quot;very much improved&quot;, &quot;much improved&quot;, &quot;minimally improved&quot;, &quot;no change&quot;, &quot;minimally worsened&quot;, &quot;much worsened&quot;, and &quot;very much worsened&quot;.</description>

    <measure>Change in Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life-54 (MSQoL54)</measure>
    <time_frame>T0: before intervention; T1: after 12 weeks of intervention; T2: 6 weeks after T1</time_frame>
    <description>The MSQOL-54 is a multidimensional health-related quality of life measure that combines both generic and MS-specific items into a single instrument. There is no single overall score for the MSQOL-54. Two summary scores - physical health and mental health - can be derived from a weighted combination of scale scores. In addition, there are 12 subscales: physical function, role limitations-physical, role limitations-emotional, pain, emotional well-being, energy, health perceptions, social function, cognitive function, health distress, overall quality of life, and sexual function. There are also two single-item measures: satisfaction with sexual function and change in health. See the original article describing the development and testing of the MSQOL-54 (Vickrey et al, 1995) for details. Administration forms and scoring instructions can be downloaded.</description>

    <time_frame>T0: before intervention; T1: after 12 weeks of intervention; T2: 6 weeks after T1</time_frame>
    <description>PWB measures 6 aspects of wellbeing/happiness that respondents rate statements on a scale of 1 to 6, with 1 indicating strong disagreement and 6 indicating strong agreement.&#xD;
Self-acceptance: High scorer: Possesses a positive attitude toward the self; Low scorer: Feels dissatisfied with self.&#xD;
Positive relations with others: Higher score: Has warm, satisfying, trusting relationships with others; Lower score: Has few close, trusting relationships with others.&#xD;
Autonomy: High scorer: Is self-determining and independent; Low scorer: Is concerned about the expectations and evaluations of others.&#xD;
Environmental mastery: High scorer: Has a sense of mastery and competence in managing the environment; Low scorer: Has difficulty managing everyday affairs; Purpose in life: High scorer: Has goals in life and a sense of directedness; Low scorer: Lacks a sense of meaning in life.&#xD;
Personal growth: High scorer: Has a continued development feeling; Low scorer: Has a personal stagnation sense.</description>

    <measure>Change in International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>T0: before intervention; T1: after 12 weeks of intervention; T2: 6 weeks after T1</time_frame>
    <description>IPAQ is a method for physical activity assessment of time spent in several domains. In particular 5 domains are considered: JOB-RELATED; TRANSPORTATION; HOUSEWORK, HOUSE MAINTENANCE, AND CARING FOR FAMILY; RECREATION, SPORT, AND LEISURE-TIME; TIME SPENT SITTING.&#xD;
Three levels of physical activity are proposed:&#xD;
Low: Those individuals who not meet criteria for categories 2 or 3.&#xD;
Moderate:&#xD;
3 or more days of vigorous activity of at least 20 minutes per day&#xD;
5 or more days of moderate-intensity activity or walking of at least 30 minutes per day&#xD;
5 or more days of any combination of walking, moderate-intensity or vigorous intensity activities achieving a minimum of at least 600 (metabolic equivalent)MET-min/week.&#xD;
High:&#xD;
Vigorous-intensity activity on at least 3 days and accumulating at least 1500 MET-minutes/ week OR&#xD;
7 or more days of any combination of walking, moderate-intensity or vigorous intensity activities achieving a minimum of at least 3000 MET-minutes/week.</description>

    <measure>Change in Minnesota Leisure-Time Physical Activity Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>T0: before intervention; T1: after 12 weeks of intervention; T2: 6 weeks after T1</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of physical activity in terms of total energy expenditure. The results were expressed in a weekly value [kcal/week] after dividing the calcu- lated 6-month energy expenditure by 26 weeks. The following ranges of activity intensity were used: low [&lt; 4 MET], medium [4 - &lt; 6 MET] and high [â‰¥ 6 MET], where 1 MET equals the resting metabolic rate, which is approximately 3.5 ml oxygen kg-1 body weight per min-1.</description>
