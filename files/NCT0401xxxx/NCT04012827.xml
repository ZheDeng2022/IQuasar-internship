  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Apatinib mesylate is a multitarget receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor. This trial is to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of apatinib mesylate combined with doxorubicin and&#xD;
      ifosfamide in the treatment of advanced soft tissue sarcoma.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Apatinib mesylate has demonstrated good efficacy and acceptable safety in patients with&#xD;
      metastatic or recurrent soft tissue sarcoma (STS). A retrospective study has evaluated the&#xD;
      efficacy of apatinib in the treatment of advanced soft tissue sarcoma. A total of 31 patients&#xD;
      with soft tissue sarcoma were enrolled in this study, including 4 patients receiving apatinib&#xD;
      first-line treatment, 8 patients receiving second-line treatment, and 19 patients receiving&#xD;
      third-line or post-third-line treatment. The results showed that ORR 33.3%, DCR 75%, and mTTP&#xD;
      4.6 months (1.8-11.6 months). In another multicentric retrospective study of apatinib for&#xD;
      osteosarcoma and soft tissue sarcoma, a total of 56 patients were enrolled and 44 were&#xD;
      treated with apatinib monotherapy. The overall results showed that ORR was 62.5%, mPFS was&#xD;
      6.6 months, and mOS was 9.9 months. In a phase II multi-center single-arm study results&#xD;
      published by Yang Jilong Yang et al at the 2018 AACR conference, ORR and DCR at 3 months also&#xD;
      reached 13.95% and 81.39%, respectively. The end point assessment ORR was further increased&#xD;
      to 15.25% at the end of the study, because some patients achieved partial remission after a&#xD;
      long period of treatment, and the final DCR reached 57.63%. Apatinib had a significant effect&#xD;
      in the treatment of stage IV osteosarcoma with failed chemotherapy. Jing Chen et al published&#xD;
      a study researching the effectiveness and security in advanced sarcoma patients after&#xD;
      apatinib treatment , the results show that 24.3% of subjects to achieve objective response,&#xD;
      including 1 case of adenoid vesicular soft tissue sarcoma patients achieved CR, seven adenoid&#xD;
      vesicular soft tissue sarcoma patients achieved the objective response, indicates that&#xD;
      apatinib is effective and well tolerated in some specific sarcoma subtype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study ,Apatinib mesylate combined with doxorubicin and ifosfamide regimens were&#xD;
      evaluated in the treatment of advanced or inoperable STS to determine the potential to&#xD;
      achieve better outcomes.&#xD;
