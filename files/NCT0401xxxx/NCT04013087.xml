  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, controlled, parallel-designed,&#xD;
      prospective study and is intended to evaluate the nutritional adequacy and tolerance of a new&#xD;
      study formula compared with a concurrent control formula. Approximately 450 infants will be&#xD;
      enrolled from approximately 3 China sites. Of these infants, approximately 300 will be&#xD;
      randomized 1:1 to receive an investigational formula or a control formula for 16weeks of&#xD;
      feeding. The remaining approximately 150 infants will be enrolled as a breastfeeding&#xD;
      reference group. The primary outcome measure is the rate of weight gain in g/day between&#xD;
      baseline and 16 weeks in the test group compared to control formula group. Participants will&#xD;
      have the option of providing stool samples at 8 weeks and 16 weeks for analysis of microbiota&#xD;
      and metabolomics. The study period will be 16 weeks, and all infants in the 2 formula groups&#xD;
      will receive formula free of charge for 6 months.&#xD;

      Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) Compare the rate of weight gain (in g/day) between infants receiving an investigational&#xD;
      formula and infants receiving a control formula between at baseline (B), B+2 weeks, B+4&#xD;
      weeks, B+8 weeks, B+12 weeks, and B+16 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Compare rate of change in length (mm/day) among infants receiving an investigational&#xD;
           formula, infants receiving a control formula, and breastfeeding infants at baseline (B),&#xD;
           B+2 weeks, B+4 weeks, B+8 weeks, B+12 weeks, and B+16 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Compare rate of change in head circumference (mm/day) among infants receiving an&#xD;
           investigational formula, infants receiving a control formula and breastfeeding infants&#xD;
           at baseline (B), B+2 weeks, B+4 weeks, B+8 weeks, B+12 weeks, and B+16 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluate and compare achieved body weight, length, and head circumference at each visit&#xD;
           and after 16 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Evaluate plotted raw growth data on World Health Organization standard growth charts.1&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Compare the types and incidence of adverse events among infants receiving an&#xD;
           investigational formula, infants receiving a control formula, and breastfeeding infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Compare average daily intake of formula between infants receiving an investigational&#xD;
           formula and infants receiving a control formula.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Compare parents' and physician's assessment of formula tolerance among infants receiving&#xD;
           an investigational formula, infants receiving a control formula, and breastfeeding&#xD;
           infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Compare counts of Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus species in stools of infants&#xD;
           receiving an investigational formula, infants receiving a control formula, and&#xD;
           breastfeeding infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Compare stool short-chain fatty acid metabolites (including total SCFAs, acetic,&#xD;
           propionic, n-butyric, iso-butyric and n-valeric acids, L-lactic acid and D-lactic acid,&#xD;
           etc) among infants receiving an investigational formula, infants receiving a control&#xD;
           formula, and breastfeeding infants.&#xD;
