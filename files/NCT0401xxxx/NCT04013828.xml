  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This qualitative study explores the lived experience of high-grade glioma patients and their&#xD;
      close relatives at time of recurrence. With focus on the decision-making about treatment and&#xD;
      care..&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      High-Grade Glioma is a life-threatening disease that can cause the patient substantial&#xD;
      physical, mentally and psychosocially impairment. The life expectancy is short, and a&#xD;
      majority of patients experience recurrence of tumour growth. At time of recurrence, the&#xD;
      treatment possibilities can include surgery, oncological treatment and/or palliative care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this situation the patients and their close relatives need to make a difficult balancing&#xD;
      between benefits and trade offs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Little is known about how the patients and their close relatives experience the recurrence&#xD;
      and the decision-making process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is therefore to explore the perspectives, experiences and needs&#xD;
      in patients and their close relatives in relation to the decision-making process at time of&#xD;
      recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be generated through semi-structured interviews. Interviews will be analysed and&#xD;
      interpreted using a Ricoeur inspired method of qualitative analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is part of a larger PhD-study.&#xD;

        Two study populations:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. - Adult patients with recurrence of high-grade glioma who are offered surgical&#xD;
             treatment as one of the treatment possibilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. - The adult relative most involved in the decision-making. The relative is apointed by&#xD;
             the patient and the patient gives written concent to the relative' participation.&#xD;
