  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studies of Greenland Inuit before the 1980s found a low prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D)&#xD;
      compared to Western populations. However, recent population studies in Greenland found a&#xD;
      notably high prevalence of diabetes (9%) and pre-diabetes (19%) in the adult population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In many studies worldwide an increase in obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease has&#xD;
      been ascribed to social transition and in particular urbanization, but the Inuit in Greenland&#xD;
      do not fit the pattern. Paradoxically, the highest prevalence of diabetes is seen in the&#xD;
      least urbanized areas. Thus, while previously rare, T2D has become epidemic in Inuit. In a&#xD;
      recent study by Moltke et al found that a variant in the TBC1D4 gene was strongly associated&#xD;
      with insulin resistance in skeletal muscle, high postprandial blood glucose and a high risk&#xD;
      of T2D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rapid increase in the prevalence of T2D and other metabolic traits and the well&#xD;
      documented genetic susceptibility indicates that lifestyle components, particularly physical&#xD;
      activity, and diet significantly modify the genetic effects on glucose homeostasis. Thus,&#xD;
      changing dietary habits from a diet high in traditional foods, mostly consisting of marine&#xD;
      mammals and fish (high in protein and unsaturated fats, and low in carbohydrate) to a&#xD;
      westernized diet, with high contents of sugar and saturated fat may have increased the T2D&#xD;
      incidence in Arctic Inuit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will perform a 4-week cross-over intervention study of the traditional diet&#xD;
      versus a western diet among homozygous carriers and WTs on 2-hour glucose after an oral&#xD;
      glucose tolerance test (OGTT). In addition, the investigators will examine the effects on&#xD;
      cardiometabolic abnormalities such as low-grade systemic inflammation and dyslipidemia.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the investigators will characterize the metabolic phenotype of participants, as&#xD;
      well as gut microbiota and brown adipose tissue markers to elucidate the molecular mechanisms&#xD;
      underlying potential improvements of a traditional Inuit diet.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of the study is to investigate whether a traditional marine diet high&#xD;
      in fat and low in carbohydrate compared to a westernized diet could improve glycemic control&#xD;
      in Greenland Inuit. Furthermore, the objective is to study whether the genetic risk of&#xD;
      postprandial hyperglycemia among Greenlandic carriers of the common nonsense p.Arg684Ter&#xD;
      variant in the TBC1D4 gene is modified to a larger degree by the diet compared to&#xD;
      non-carriers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will perform a 4-week cross-over intervention study of the traditional diet&#xD;
      versus a western diet among homozygous carriers and WTs on 2-hour glucose after an oral&#xD;
      glucose tolerance test (OGTT). In addition, the investigators will examine the effects on&#xD;
      cardiometabolic abnormalities such as low-grade systemic inflammation and dyslipidemia.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the investigators will characterize the metabolic phenotype of participants, as&#xD;
      well as gut microbiota and brown adipose tissue markers to elucidate the molecular mechanisms&#xD;
      underlying potential improvements of a traditional Inuit diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is expected to provide relevant information in relation to whether diet has a role&#xD;
      in preventing T2D in the large group of people who are hetero / homozygous for the TBC1D4&#xD;
      variant. The investigators expect this enhanced insight to be useful and valuable for future&#xD;
      development of genotype based interventions for these persons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the individual participant, the results of the study are expected to provide constructive&#xD;
      knowledge to guide the participants in which actions they could take to reduce the likelihood&#xD;
      of developing T2D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the traditional marine diet very high in fat and low in&#xD;
      carbohydrates will improve postprandial glucose handling in Greenland Inuit. Furthermore, the&#xD;
      investigators hypothesise that this effect is modified among carriers of the common nonsense&#xD;
      p.Arg684Ter variant in the TBC1D4 gene which will have larger effects of following the&#xD;
      traditional marine diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall study design 30 homozygous carriers and 30 homozygous non-carriers of the nonsense&#xD;
      p.Arg684Ter variant in the TBC1D4 gene between 18-80 years will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted as a randomized, controlled, cross-over design, comprising two&#xD;
      dietary intervention periods of four weeks duration, with no washout in between. The&#xD;
      participants will be randomized to start on one of the two diet periods and cross-over to the&#xD;
      other dietary period at 4 weeks (see figure 1). The investigators expect to recruit&#xD;
      participants after approval from April 2019 and have the last patient last visit by September&#xD;
      2020. Recruitment of study participants will be based on the currently ongoing Greenland&#xD;
      Population Study (project 2017-5582) to ensure that the investigators have 50% homozygous&#xD;
      carriers of the nonsense p.Arg684Ter variant in the TBC1D4 gene. The study will be carried&#xD;
      out in three geographical areas: Nuuk, Qaanaaq, and Qasigiannguit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization, allocation, concealment, and blinding&#xD;
&#xD;
      After having given oral and written consent, randomization will be performed separately for&#xD;
      each participant based on the genotype in blocks of variable size to ensure equal&#xD;
      randomization throughout the enrolment phase of the study. The randomization sequence will be&#xD;
      done by an investigator without contact to the participants. The personnel conducting the&#xD;
      study will allocate participants to the sequence of intervention using a list of participant&#xD;
      IDs matched with allocated sequences. Blinding participants is not feasible due to the nature&#xD;
      of the intervention, however blinding of the allocation sequence will be established during&#xD;
      sample analysis and initial data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two diets will be designed for the intervention. A traditional Inuit diet (TID) rich in&#xD;
      marine mammals (such as walrus, seal, and whale), fish, caribou and musk ox, with low intake&#xD;
      of grains, fast food, and other imported foods. The TID diet will be high in fat (&gt;40 of the&#xD;
      energy (E%)) and low in carbohydrate (&lt;30 E%). The Westernized diet will be consisting of&#xD;
      high amounts of grains, potatoes, rice and imported meats from livestock animals (beef, pork,&#xD;
      and chicken). The Westernized diet will be high in carbohydrate (55-65 E%) and lower in fat&#xD;
      (30-35 E%). Major parts (20-25E%) of the diet will be given to the participants upon start&#xD;
      and during the study in the form of frozen goods. For the TID group, this will be marine&#xD;
      mammals and fish, while for the Westernized group the products delivered will mainly be&#xD;
      grains and livestock animals. Instructions for the participants regarding the incorporation&#xD;
      of dietary changes will be performed by trained study staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study products&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of habitual food intake at baseline will be conducted with a previously validated&#xD;
      food frequency questionnaire. A modified version of the food frequency questionnaire will be&#xD;
      used at the end of each intervention period for assessing habitual diet during the&#xD;
      intervention period. In addition, participants will be asked to keep a simple log of&#xD;
      ingestion of delivered products to estimate compliance. The investigators will apply for&#xD;
      sponsorship for study products. The potential study product sponsors will play no role in the&#xD;
      design, methods, data management and analysis or in the decision to publish.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consumption of Study products&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trained study personnel will provide participants with instructions on how to incorporate the&#xD;
      provided study products in the diet. Initially, it will be ensured that the study products&#xD;
      are provided in sufficient amounts to ensure ad libitum consumption. Participants will be&#xD;
      provided individualized amounts of all study products every second week. All study products&#xD;
      are provided as fresh or frozen products, and all food products will be picked up at the&#xD;
      local study site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study examinations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will arrive for clinical examination after an overnight fast of at least 8&#xD;
      hours. Lifestyle questionnaires, including a food frequency questionnaire and questionnaires&#xD;
      about medication use, will be performed for baseline characterization of the participants.&#xD;
      Blood pressure and anthropometric measurements are performed including measurements of body&#xD;
      weight, height, waist and hip circumference, sagittal abdominal diameter and bio-impedance&#xD;
      measurements for assessing body fat mass. A fasting blood sample is obtained and an OGTT is&#xD;
      performed with collection of blood samples after 0, 30 and 120 min. Samples will be analyzed&#xD;
      with standard clinical procedures for glycaemic variability markers, including glucose,&#xD;
      insulin, c-peptide, and HbA1c, as well as plasma lipids. Circulating fatty acids profiles&#xD;
      will be used as a marker of compliance with the TID using dried blood spots. Furthermore,&#xD;
      fecal samples will be collected at all examination visits and kept stored for future&#xD;
      microbiota analyses, using untargeted shotgun sequencing. Biobanked samples will be stored&#xD;
      for further analyses which could include gastrointestinal hormones, gut microbiota&#xD;
      metabolites, additional compliance markers such as alkylresorcinols (for grain intake)&#xD;
      low-grade inflammation markers and markers of brown fat accumulation. In addition,&#xD;
      participants will be equipped with a 24-h continuous glucose monitoring device for 14 days at&#xD;
      the end of each intervention period. All 3 examination days consists of similar examinations&#xD;
      and data collections and are estimated to last approximately 5 hours.&#xD;
