      This pilot study is designed to provide preliminary data for a large scale, randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of remotely administrated at home transcranial Direct&#xD;
      Current Stimulation (tDCS) with real-time monitoring via VA Tele-health for persistent post&#xD;
      traumatic headache associated with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). Participants will&#xD;
      receive total of 20 sessions of tDCS over four weeks. The investigators anticipate that the&#xD;
      results generated from the study will directly translate into immediate meaningful clinical&#xD;
      application: not only in management of chronic post traumatic headache, but also in reduction&#xD;
      of acute pain medication use, and improving quality of life for our veterans with this&#xD;
      debilitating neurological disorder.&#xD;

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of transcranial Direct&#xD;
      Current Stimulation (tDCS) administered at home with real-time monitoring via VA Tele-health&#xD;
      for persistent post traumatic headache (PTH) associated with mTBI, and the impact of this&#xD;
      treatment on persistent PTH associated functional recovery. Total of 20 participants (10&#xD;
      treatment group, 10 sham control) will be included in this study. The investigators will also&#xD;
      evaluate recruitment strategies and participants clinical characteristics.&#xD;

    <description>To evaluate the impact of headaches on the quality of life measures (pain and disability) based on change in Headache impact test-6 (HIT-6) from baseline period to end of treatment phase, and to end of follow-up phase in persistent PTH. The six-item Headache Impact Test (HIT-6) provides a global measure of adverse headache impact and was developed to use in screening and monitoring patients with headaches in both clinical practice and clinical research. A total HIT-6 score ranges from 36 to 78: Little or no impact = HIT-6 score 49 or less; Some impact = HIT-6 score 50-55; Substantial impact = HIT-6 score 56-59; Severe impact = HIT-6 score 60.</description>
