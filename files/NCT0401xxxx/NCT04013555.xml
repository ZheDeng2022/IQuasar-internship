  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Kynurenic acid (KYNA) is a naturally occurring chemical in the brain. Studies with rodents&#xD;
      indicate that levels of KYNA can impact levels of the neurotransmitters glutamate and&#xD;
      dopamine. One way to reliably increase KYNA levels is by ingesting the amino acid tryptophan.&#xD;
      Tryptophan is a normal part of the human diet. Tryptophan gets metabolized/changed to other&#xD;
      chemicals in the body- including KYNA. By giving people 6 grams of tryptophan, the&#xD;
      investigators will be able to increase the KYNA level in a controlled way. The investigators&#xD;
      will then be able to study the effects of KYNA on neurotransmitters by using cognitive tests&#xD;
      and magnetic resonance imaging techniques (measuring brain activity and brain chemistry using&#xD;
      the MRI magnet).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall goal of the study is to examine how the medication N-acetylcysteine (NAC), when&#xD;
      added to tryptophan, affects various cognitive functions, such as verbal and visual memory.&#xD;
      The investigators will also use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to examine how NAC affects&#xD;
      brain activity and chemicals.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to examine whether high dose N-acetylcysteine (NAC) blocks the&#xD;
      adverse effects of increased kynurenic acid (KYNA) on selected measures of brain chemistry,&#xD;
      function and behavior, through the inhibition of kynurenine aminotransferase (KAT) II, which&#xD;
      converts kynurenine to KYNA. The study will be a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized&#xD;
      cross-over challenge study, in which people with schizophrenia are pretreated with either&#xD;
      high-dose NAC, 140 mg/kg up to a maximum of 15 g, or placebo, then receive tryptophan (TRYP),&#xD;
      6 gms. The tryptophan challenge method robustly increases peripheral measures of kynurenine&#xD;
      and KYNA in humans and putatively increases brain KYNA levels, through the CNS conversion of&#xD;
      kynurenine to KYNA; a process that is observed in both rodents and nonhuman primates. The&#xD;
      investigators will evaluate the ability of NAC to inhibit the conversion of kynurenine to&#xD;
      KYNA with the following primary outcome measures: 1) the investigators will measure serum&#xD;
      kynurenine and KYNA before and after NAC/placebo pre-treatment and TRYP administration and&#xD;
      examine whether NAC compared to placebo blocks the peripheral conversion of kynurenine to&#xD;
      KYNA; 2) the investigators will use the arterial spin labeling (ASL) technique to measure&#xD;
      whole brain and frontal gray matter cerebral blood flow (CBF) before and after NAC/placebo&#xD;
      pre-treatment and TRYP administration and examine whether NAC compared to placebo attenuates&#xD;
      the effects of TRYP on ASL CBF measures; 3) the investigators will use magnetic resonance&#xD;
      spectroscopy (MRS) to measure glutamate and glutathione levels in the medial prefrontal&#xD;
      cortex (mPFC) before and after NAC/placebo pre-treatment and TRYP administration and examine&#xD;
      whether NAC compared to placebo increases MRS glutathione and glutamate measures; and 4) the&#xD;
      investigators will use diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to measure white matter fractional&#xD;
      anisotropy (FA) before and after NAC/placebo pre-treatment and TRYP administration and&#xD;
      examine whether NAC compared to placebo increases white matter FA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will have two secondary endpoints. First, if the investigators observe that&#xD;
      NAC attenuates the effects of TRYP on ASL and/or increases mPFC glutamate levels or white&#xD;
      matter DTI FA, then the investigators will examine whether these effects are related to&#xD;
      changes in cognitive measures of attention, verbal and visual memory, and working memory.&#xD;
      Second, the investigators will use measures of serum KYNA and peripheral blood mononuclear&#xD;
      cell (PBMC) kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (KMO) activity levels to examine whether the level of&#xD;
      these measures is related to the observed effects of NAC on our neuroimaging and cognitive&#xD;
      outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that NAC will inhibit KAT II, which will be reflected in the:&#xD;
      1) decreased peripheral conversion of kynurenine to KYNA; and 2) increased CBF, glutamate,&#xD;
      and white matter fractional anisotropy (FA). In addition, the investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      the NAC effects on the neuroimaging measures will be related to improved performance on&#xD;
      cognitive measures of attention, verbal and visual memory and working memory. These observed&#xD;
      effects of NAC will be greater than those seen with placebo. The investigators further&#xD;
      hypothesize that the NAC effects on ASL CBF, glutamate, and FA measures will be independent&#xD;
      of NAC-induced changes in MRS glutathione, i.e., not due to the NAC oxidative stress&#xD;
      mechanism, but, rather, will be correlated with NAC-induced reductions in the peripheral&#xD;
      conversion of kynurenine to KYNA. Finally, the investigators hypothesize that the observed&#xD;
      effects of NAC on CBF, glutamate, and FA will be related to baseline serum KMO activity and&#xD;
      KYNA levels. The demonstration that NAC reverses the adverse impact of increased KYNA levels&#xD;
      will importantly support the development of KAT II inhibitors for the enhancement of&#xD;
      cognition in schizophrenia.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This will be a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized cross-over challenge study. Participant randomization will use a permuted block randomization system (block sizes 2 or 4), in which treatment assignment order is random within each block, with an equal number of participants assigned to each treatment, to generate a list of treatment assignments. Thus, it will be difficult to ascertain the next treatment assignment, even if a participant becomes unblinded, while any imbalance in the number of participants between the treatment groups will be kept within tight limits.</intervention_model_description>
