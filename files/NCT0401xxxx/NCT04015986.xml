    <textblock>
      Background (brief):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Burden: A total of 52 million children under 5 are suffering from acute malnutrition&#xD;
           globally, of whom 33 million suffer from moderate acute malnutrition (MAM). In&#xD;
           Bangladesh, around 2 million children suffer from MAM. In absolute numbers, according to&#xD;
           Bangladesh Demographic Health Survey 2014, 26%, 25% and 17% of children aged less than&#xD;
           two years are stunted, underweight and wasted respectively.1&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Knowledge gap: We have already demonstrated that children with acute malnutrition have&#xD;
           immature gut microbiota that is partially corrected with treatment. Children with MAM&#xD;
           have an increased risk of mortality, infections and impaired physical and cognitive&#xD;
           development compared to well-nourished children. Although the global caseload of MAM is&#xD;
           much greater than that of SAM, the condition has not received the same level of&#xD;
           attention or priority. Through our previous and ongoing research we now know about the&#xD;
           members of the gut microbiota that can promote growth in children and also about certain&#xD;
           food ingredients that promote the proliferation of such beneficial microbiota. However,&#xD;
           this knowledge needs to be applied on a large scale community-based clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Relevance: The rationale for this study is to assess whether long-term administration of&#xD;
           complementary food made of locally available food ingredients that can stimulate the&#xD;
           proliferation of growth promoting gut microbiota (MDCF-2), as identified in our Pre-POC&#xD;
           trial, is able to produce predictable changes in the microbiota of Bangladeshi children&#xD;
           with Post-SAM MAM as well as in their nutritional status. We would now like to do a&#xD;
           community-based clinical trial of this potential MDCF-2 in the management of children&#xD;
           with Post-SAM MAM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis (if any): Complementary foods made of locally available food ingredients that&#xD;
      stimulate the proliferation of growth promoting gut microbiota (MDCF-2) will improve clinical&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To investigate the efficacy of complementary food made of locally available food&#xD;
      ingredients that can stimulate the proliferation of growth promoting gut microbiota&#xD;
      (Microbiota Directed Complementary Food: MDCF-2) in (i) promoting repair of microbiota&#xD;
      immaturity (ii) promoting proliferation of beneficial bacteria (iii) improving both linear&#xD;
      and ponderal growth in children with Post-SAM MAM (iv) improving the metabolomic profile of&#xD;
      children with Post-SAM MAM&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: We will conduct a proof of concept (POC) clinical trial in 12-18 months old children&#xD;
      with post-SAM MAM (Weight-for-Length Z-score, WLZ &lt;-2 to -3) over the course of approximately&#xD;
      two years. This study will be undertaken at Mirpur area of Dhaka city and in Kurigram. We&#xD;
      will produce MDCF-2 at the icddr,b Food Processing Laboratory in sufficient quantities for&#xD;
      the trial. This formulation is matched for energy density and micronutrient content of ready&#xD;
      to use supplementary food (RUSF) used for MAM. It itself is not a ready-to-use food but is&#xD;
      rather a cooked food made of locally available food ingredients (chickpea, green banana,&#xD;
      peanut, soybean flour) which have been found to enhance growth promoting members of the gut&#xD;
      microbiota in children. We will test MDCF-2 and the current RUSF standard of care for Post&#xD;
      SAM MAM to see the effect on growth, proteomics and metabolomics of an intervention for 12&#xD;
      weeks, with a 4-week post-intervention phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures/variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ponderal growth (rate of weight gain as the primary outcome variable), measured at&#xD;
           different time points by anthropometry&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Linear growth, measured at different time points by anthropometry&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proteomic profile, assayed by DNA aptamer based SOMAlogic scan&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Morbidity, assessed by daily records&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in microbiota-for-age Z score&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis to be tested:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complementary food made of locally available food ingredients that can stimulate the&#xD;
      proliferation of growth promoting gut microbiota (MDCF-2) will improve nutritional outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Objectives To investigate the efficacy of complementary food made of locally&#xD;
      available food ingredients that can stimulate the proliferation of growth promoting gut&#xD;
      microbiota (Microbiota Directed Complementary Food: MDCF-2) in&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i) promoting repair of microbiota immaturity (ii) promoting proliferation of beneficial&#xD;
      bacteria (iii) improving both linear and ponderal growth in children with Post-SAM MAM (iv)&#xD;
      improving the metabolomic profile of children with Post-SAM MAM&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moderate acute malnutrition (MAM), a major global health problem, is defined as wasting (i.e.&#xD;
      weight-for-height between &lt;-2 and -3 Z-scores of the WHO Child Growth Standards) and/or&#xD;
      mid-upper-arm circumference (MUAC) greater or equal to 115 mm and less than 125 mm. According&#xD;
      to the Global Nutrition Report 2017, 8% or 52 million under-five children were acutely&#xD;
      malnourished globally in 2016 and stunting or chronic malnutrition affected 23% or 155&#xD;
      million children. Approximately one in 6 children under 5 years in South Asia suffered from&#xD;
      MAM in 2013 (i.e. 17%). These children are at increased risk of severe acute malnutrition&#xD;
      (SAM), and have a three times higher risk of mortality from common communicable diseases than&#xD;
      the well-nourished peers. Bangladesh has one of the highest childhood malnutrition burdens in&#xD;
      the world. According to Bangladesh Demographic Health Survey 2014, the prevalence of stunting&#xD;
      in the country among under-five children is 36%, among them 12% suffer from severe stunting&#xD;
      (LAZ &lt;-3).1 Around 15% of children are wasted (weight-for-length, WLZ &lt;-2); more than 2&#xD;
      million children suffer from MAM, while 3% or 450,000 children suffer from the deadly form of&#xD;
      SAM. Malnutrition costs Bangladesh an estimated US $1 billion a year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to WHO recommendations, infants and children aged 6-59 months with MAM need to&#xD;
      consume nutrient-dense foods to meet their extra needs for weight and height gain and&#xD;
      functional recovery. Currently there are no evidence-informed recommendations on the&#xD;
      composition of supplementary foods used to treat children with MAM. Interventions to address&#xD;
      undernutrition should therefore include a strong component of MAM management. MAM prevention&#xD;
      should be taken into consideration in food security and other development strategies as the&#xD;
      situation becomes critical in populations where food insecurity is rampant. It is important&#xD;
      therefore to develop interventions that depend upon locally available food ingredients which&#xD;
      in small quantities are able to harness the beneficial power of the gut microbiota on infant&#xD;
      and child growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the major factors limiting the impact of nutrition interventions is the inability of&#xD;
      the malnourished children to increase their intake to meet increased metabolic demands. In&#xD;
      collaborative studies between icddr,b and the Gordon Lab at Washington University in St.&#xD;
      Louis during the Jumpstart Phase of the Breast Milk, Microbiota and Immunity (BMMI) Project,&#xD;
      we applied Random Forests, to bacterial 16S rRNA (ribosomal RiboNucleic Acid ) datasets&#xD;
      generated from monthly fecal samples obtained from a birth-cohort of children living in an&#xD;
      urban slum of Dhaka, Bangladesh. These children exhibited consistently healthy growth (WLZ&#xD;
      -0.32+0.98). Bacterial strains were identified whose proportional representation defines a&#xD;
      healthy gut microbiota as it assembles during the first 2-3 postnatal years. In a randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial at icddr,b of two therapeutic foods (imported ready-to-use therapeutic food&#xD;
      [RUTF, Plumpy'Nut] versus locally prepared rice/lentil-based Khichuri and Halwa) in&#xD;
      Bangladeshi children with severe acute malnutrition (SAM), it was observed that the&#xD;
      microbiota immaturity is incompletely and only transiently improved, with children remaining&#xD;
      markedly stunted and underweight throughout the follow-up period. Bangladeshi children with&#xD;
      MAM also exhibited significant microbiota immaturity, although less severe than children with&#xD;
      SAM. Microbiota immaturity thus serves as a potential biomarker to identify infants at risk&#xD;
      for undernutrition and to monitor treatment and prevention strategies. In our previous study&#xD;
      approved by the ERC (PR-09023), we compared the gut microbiota of healthy children living in&#xD;
      slum of Mirpur with children hospitalized for the treatment of severe acute malnutrition. The&#xD;
      microbiota was assessed by 16S Ribosomal RNA sequencing. We found that the gut microbiota of&#xD;
      children with SAM lags chronologically behind microbiota of healthy children. For example, a&#xD;
      two year old child with SAM may have the gut microbiota similar to that of a one year old&#xD;
      healthy child. This is known as immaturity of the gut microbiota. We have developed two&#xD;
      metrices to represent this gut immaturity - the relative microbiota maturity index and the&#xD;
      microbiota-for-age Z score; SAM is associated with significant relative microbiota immaturity&#xD;
      that is only partially ameliorated following nutritional interventions. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      We recently developed ready-to-use therapeutic foods using locally available food&#xD;
      ingredients-rice, lentil, and chickpeas that are culturally relevant and acceptable. We found&#xD;
      through a double-blind RCT (Randomized Controlled Trial ) that the Bangladeshi chickpea-based&#xD;
      and rice-lentil-based RUTF (Ready To Use Therapeutic Food) we developed were as effective as&#xD;
      the commercial peanut based-RUTF and well accepted by children with SAM. Through a&#xD;
      combination of the above mentioned RCT and clinical translational studies conducted over the&#xD;
      last 7-8 years, we have identified growth promoting age-discriminatory beneficial microbiota&#xD;
      and locally available food ingredients that support proliferation of these beneficial&#xD;
      microbiota. Besides, earlier studies done on gnotobiotic animals in Washington University&#xD;
      Centre for Genome Science has led us to suggest that a combination of food ingredients&#xD;
      (chickpea, soy flour, peanut and green banana) being informed by studies done in Dhaka will&#xD;
      be worth studying with respect to the diet's impact on stimulating proliferation of&#xD;
      growth-discriminatory microbiota as well as cost and sustainability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently we successfully completed an IRB approved study, 'Pre-Proof of Concept clinical&#xD;
      trials to optimize lead microbiota-directed complementary food (MDCF) prototypes for their&#xD;
      ability to repair microbiota immaturity and establish their organoleptic acceptability'&#xD;
      (PR-16099). The main objective of this pilot study was to demonstrate a Pre-proof of Concept&#xD;
      that certain complementary foods would have a beneficial effect on young children suffering&#xD;
      from MAM, by stimulating the proliferation of particular members of gut microbiota that are&#xD;
      known for their growth promoting effects. In that pilot study we investigated&#xD;
      Microbiota-for-age Z (MAZ) score as well as the impact of proliferation of good members of&#xD;
      the gut microbiota on certain body systems. This study was designed to test the effects of&#xD;
      three locally produced MDCF prototypes (MDCF-1, MDCF-2 and MDCF-3) and a locally produced&#xD;
      rice-lentil-based RUSF. The results of the Pre POC pilot trial conclusively showed that one&#xD;
      of the three MDCFs (namely MDCF-2) was associated with increased levels of certain amino&#xD;
      acids that have a key role in development of long bones, development of the brain and&#xD;
      increased production of IGF-1 (Insulin like Growth Factor-1) which are critical factors in&#xD;
      the biology of child growth. Also it is effective in stimulating the growth of growth&#xD;
      promoting members of the gut microbiota, for example Faecalibacterium prausnitzii. Based on&#xD;
      the result of this Pre-POC pilot trial we now plan to do a larger clinical trial using the&#xD;
      most promising MDCF-2 on the management of Post-SAM MAM children with the primary end point&#xD;
      being linear growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design and Methods We will conduct a clinical trial among 12-18 months old children&#xD;
      with Post-SAM MAM (WLZ &lt;-2 to -3) over the course of approximately two years. The trial will&#xD;
      be conducted at Bauniabadh and RADDA MCH-FP clinic in Mirpur area of Dhaka city, and at the&#xD;
      Special Nutrition Unit (SNU) run by Terre des Hommes (TdH) in Kurigram. The TdH SNU has been&#xD;
      selected because we want to expedite the enrolment and we have a good track record of working&#xD;
      there; the last efficacy trial we conducted on our local RUTFs was also done there partly.&#xD;
      Children will be screened and enrolled through household survey by Field Research Assistants&#xD;
      (FRAs) following pre-specified inclusion criteria. Fulfilling the enrolment criteria and upon&#xD;
      receiving the consent for study participation from the parents or legal guardians, the&#xD;
      children with the respective mother/caregiver will be enrolled and randomly assigned to one&#xD;
      of the two arms according to computer-generated random numbers. The code of assigned type of&#xD;
      diet will be kept in closed opaque envelopes for each individual, and will be opened only&#xD;
      when the caregiver signs the consent form. This trial will not fall under any typical drug&#xD;
      trial. However, if we are to consider this trial under any phase, then it would fall under&#xD;
      phase II, because we have already done a pilot trial looking at the impact on&#xD;
      microbiota-for-age Z score as well as adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First of all, there will be the stabilization phase, which will be for 4-8 days, during that&#xD;
      time each child will be managed as per WHO (World Health Organization) / icddr,b guidelines&#xD;
      for the management of SAM. This includes programmed feeding, micronutrient supplementation,&#xD;
      judicious rehydration, broad spectrum antibiotic treatment and prompt recognition and&#xD;
      management of complications. Upon recovery from the stabilization phase nutritional&#xD;
      rehabilitation will continue for approximately 2 weeks during which the icddr,b standard of&#xD;
      care dietary protocol based upon the local diets Halwa and Khichuri will be served. Upon&#xD;
      graduation from SAM to MAM (edema-free WLZ &lt;-2), children will be randomly assigned to one of&#xD;
      the two arms (Rice-lentil based RUSF and MDCF-2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The post randomization nutritional rehabilitation component will have 3 phases. The first&#xD;
      phase will involve onsite feeding of the diet twice daily for 1 month at the nutrition&#xD;
      centres established in Mirpur and Kurigram. The second phase will entail feeding the children&#xD;
      once at the nutrition center and once at home. During the third phase the children will be&#xD;
      fed the diets twice daily at home. The children will be observed for 4 weeks in the&#xD;
      post-intervention phase. During the entire study period, anthropometric data, food diversity&#xD;
      data and samples (blood, stool, and urine) will be collected. We will collect weekly&#xD;
      qualitative dietary intake data of over the last 24 hours by using Food Frequency&#xD;
      Questionnaires during the dietary intervention for all study participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization After the stabilization and nutritional rehabilitation phases when the children&#xD;
      will reach to MAM state they will be randomly assigned to one of the two arms (Rice-lentil&#xD;
      based RUSF and MDCF-2). The code of the assigned type of treatments will be kept in closed&#xD;
      opaque envelopes until assigned to an enrolled child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 1- Rice-lentil based RUSF (rationale: reference standard of care for post-SAM, MAM; based&#xD;
      on knowledge of its effects on child growth and the gut microbiota) Arm 2- MDCF-2 prototype&#xD;
      with four complimentary food ingredients without powdered milk (rationale: lead with evidence&#xD;
      from the recently completed pre-POC clinical trial of promoting growth promoting microbiota&#xD;
      and positive effects on growth).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment, Screening and Consenting Children with SAM will be identified through direct&#xD;
      observation and screening in icddr,b Dhaka Hospital, RADDA-MCH-FP Clinic in Mirpur, the SNU&#xD;
      of TdH in Kurigram, as well as through screening in the communities in Mirpur and Sadar,&#xD;
      Ulipur and Chilmari Upazilas of Kurigram district. Those who require stabilization care will&#xD;
      be admitted in the facilities mentioned above where the standard of care for the acute phase&#xD;
      treatment of SAM will be provided. In brief; this stabilization care is based upon programmed&#xD;
      feeding, micronutrient supplementation, judicious rehydration, broad spectrum antibiotic&#xD;
      treatment and prompt recognition and management of complications. They will subsequently be&#xD;
      treated with the standard of care dietary protocol for nutritional rehabilitation. Upon&#xD;
      graduation into MAM, parents of children who meet the MAM criteria for post-SAM MAM trial&#xD;
      will be approached about enrolment into the study. A trained Field Research Assistant (FRA)&#xD;
      will explain the study in detail, answer any questions from the parent(s), and invite the&#xD;
      parent(s) to enrol the child in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the beginning of the study, information will be sought on the demographic characteristics&#xD;
      and FRAs will record the children's weight using a digital scale with 2 g precision (Seca,&#xD;
      model 728, Germany), length (using infantometer, Seca, model 416, Germany), and mid-upper-arm&#xD;
      circumference to the nearest mm (using a non-stretch insertion tape). Anthropometrics will be&#xD;
      done according to the standard procedures. Study participants will be asked to come to the&#xD;
      designated nutrition center for nutritional therapy to ensure intake of the MDCF/RUSF. They&#xD;
      will be provided with a phone number to reach the clinic staff, and a member of the staff may&#xD;
      visit a family's household for directly observed nutritional therapy with prior arrangement&#xD;
      if needed. The programmed feeding of the MDCF-2 or RUSF for three months after nutritional&#xD;
      rehabilitation is illustrated in the figure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preparation of MDCF-2 and RUSF:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on compatible combinations of complementary food ingredients identified in the Pre-POC&#xD;
      study mentioned above, we will prepare MDCF-2 as well as RUSF at the icddr,b Food Processing&#xD;
      facility in Mirpur and in Kurigram in sufficient quantities for the clinical study. The two&#xD;
      diets will be matched in energy density and micronutrient content. The energy density of&#xD;
      MDCF-2 is targeted at 125 kcal/25 g (per serving), and caloric distribution is targeted to be&#xD;
      45-50 percent from fat and 8-10 percent from protein. The two servings of MDCF-2 or RUSF will&#xD;
      provide 250 Kcal and the necessary micronutrients in addition to providing the substrate for&#xD;
      the beneficial microbiota proliferation. The servings are meant to be a top up to the usual&#xD;
      diet received by these children at home. Mothers/primary caregivers will be advised to&#xD;
      maintain their child's current dietary and breastfeeding practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experiments in development of the MDCF-2 prototypes and assessment of the organoleptic&#xD;
      properties have been done in the Pre-POC clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Food will be prepared everyday to ensure that no unexpected contamination and nutrient losses&#xD;
      occur during preparation. Although raw food ingredients will be very carefully procured from&#xD;
      the local market and stored in reasonable quantities, we will prepare, dispense, and feed the&#xD;
      children the same day the MDCF-2 and RUSF are prepared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After receiving the raw materials (rice/lentil/chickpea) we will take out the foreign&#xD;
      materials/grains or seeds (if there is any) those can be discarded, and then in an open pan&#xD;
      the raw materials will be roasted. We will maintain the temperature at 120-130°C for&#xD;
      roasting. Usually it takes 8-10 minutes for roasting 100g of each raw material. Continuous&#xD;
      stirring is essential to ensure roasting of single seeds/grains. After completion of roasting&#xD;
      we will keep it aside for cooling and then we will grind. We will take the powder and strain&#xD;
      it using a strainer. After straining for 4 to 5 times, we will take the fine powder for&#xD;
      mixing with the other ingredients (milk powder/oil). We will also grind the sugar and the&#xD;
      fine powder will be used for mixing. Finally we will add the pre-weighed premix powder. The&#xD;
      processing of whole green banana is different from the other ingredients. Green banana with&#xD;
      skin will be placed in a deep pan in boiling water (100°C-110°C) and boiled for about 17-20&#xD;
      minutes until they are cooked and tender. The skin of the green banana will be peeled off and&#xD;
      the edible white part would be taken and grated into small pieces. Then they will be taken in&#xD;
      a pot and allowed to cool. We will smash the small pieces of banana with spoon/hand crusher.&#xD;
      The weights of all other ingredients will be recorded. Potential recipes will be produced in&#xD;
      small batches by mixing all ingredients in an electric blender. Preparation of food under&#xD;
      different steps, that is, roasting, particle size reduction, homogeneous blending, and&#xD;
      supplying to the nutrition centres will be monitored by icddr,b investigators. Food will be&#xD;
      prepared everyday to ensure that no unexpected contamination and nutrient losses occur during&#xD;
      preparation. Although raw food ingredients will be very carefully procured from the local&#xD;
      market and stored in reasonable quantities, we will prepare, dispense, and feed the children&#xD;
      the same day the MDCF and RUSF are prepared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feeding sessions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The children and mothers/caregivers will be requested to come to the nutrition centers&#xD;
      established at the sites preferably between 9-11 am and 3-5 pm every day for the first month.&#xD;
      The mothers will be requested not to give any food and breast milk in the 2 hours preceding&#xD;
      the observed meal time. The child will be offered 25 grams of MDCF-2 or RUSF per serving as&#xD;
      decided by randomization. The mothers will be asked to spoon feed the pre-weighed diets to&#xD;
      their children until s/he refuses to eat, as described below. After a two-minute pause, the&#xD;
      same diet will be offered a second time until s/he refuses again. After a second two-minute&#xD;
      pause, the diet will be offered a third time until refused again. After this third refusal,&#xD;
      the feeding episode will be considered as 'terminated'. The duration of the feeding&#xD;
      (excluding the intervening 'rest periods') will be recorded by stopwatch, and the total&#xD;
      duration of the feeding will be noted. This feeding episode will last for maximum 60 minutes.&#xD;
      Measured volumes of plain water will also be given and the amount of water taken during this&#xD;
      meal period of 60 minutes will be measured. The feeding episode will take place under the&#xD;
      direct supervision of trained study personnel. Children will be considered as refusing&#xD;
      further intake if they move their head away from the food, cry, clamp the mouth or clinch the&#xD;
      teeth, or become agitated, spit out the food or refuse to swallow. The amount of MDCF-2/RUSF&#xD;
      actually ingested will be calculated by subtracting the left over from the offered amount, or&#xD;
      by asking the mother when fed at home. The enrolled children will be monitored daily by Field&#xD;
      Research Assistants for any possible side effects/adverse events (e.g. rash, urticaria due to&#xD;
      food allergy or any significant changes in clinical status) for a week. If any side&#xD;
      effects/adverse events are observed, they will be treated according to standard of care. A&#xD;
      standardized production procedure will be followed to control the quality of RUSF and MDCF-2.&#xD;
      Every child will be offered 25gm of the diet twice daily at the feeding center for the first&#xD;
      4 weeks. In the following month, the child will be offered 25gm of the diet at the feeding&#xD;
      center and additional 25gm will be provided in a clean container to feed at home. In the&#xD;
      third month, two separate containers containing 25gm diet will be provided every day to each&#xD;
      enrolled child at participant's home. Feeding information will be collected from mothers and&#xD;
      amount consumed will be measured from the left outs. Food will be kept in sterile containers&#xD;
      and at room temperature in between the feeding session. Quality of the food will be ensured&#xD;
      by having samples of the prepared foods tested for microbes and moulds every 2 months at&#xD;
      icddr,b. Samples selected for testing will include food stored for 2 and 6 hours after&#xD;
      cooking. The samples will also be tested for Aflatoxin every six months at SGS Laboratories,&#xD;
      Delhi.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study nutritional status will be assessed through anthropometry, comparing with WHO&#xD;
      growth reference standards. At the beginning of the study, information will be sought on the&#xD;
      demographic characteristics (families' wealth, standard of housing, family structure and&#xD;
      parental characteristics etc.), and FRAs will record the children's weight using a digital&#xD;
      scale with 2g precision (Seca, model 728, Germany), length (using infantometer, Seca, model&#xD;
      416, Germany), and mid upper-arm circumference to the nearest mm (using a non-stretch&#xD;
      insertion tape). Anthropometrics will be done according to the standard procedures and all&#xD;
      measurements will be taken thrice and the average value will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fecal sample collection In acute phase of stabilization fecal samples will be collected every&#xD;
      alternative day. During the rehabilitation phase, weekly fecal samples (1-2g) will be&#xD;
      collected within 30 minutes of production (at home and transported back to the icddr,b) using&#xD;
      the Nitrogen dry shipper specimen collection SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) used in the&#xD;
      recent Pre-POC clinical trial (Appendix-A). Specimens will be stored at -80◦C before being&#xD;
      sent to the Gordon Lab at the end of each study for analysis of microbiota maturity (measured&#xD;
      before, during and after cessation of treatment with MDCF-2 and RUSF) and PCR-based&#xD;
      assessment of enteropathogen burden in fecal samples (measured before and after MDCF-2&#xD;
      treatment). A total of 12 fecal samples will be collected from each child at different time&#xD;
      points during whole study period. Assuming 62 study participants / arm, a total of 1488 fecal&#xD;
      specimens will be collected in this study. Along with that 2 gm of fecal sample will be&#xD;
      collected from the mothers at the beginning of stabilization phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine sample collection A total of 7 urine samples (2 ml each) will be collected from each&#xD;
      child at different time points during the whole study period. Assuming 62 study participants&#xD;
      / arm, a total of 868 urine samples will be collected in this study. Along with that 5 ml of&#xD;
      urine samples will be collected from the mothers at the beginning of stabilization phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood sample collection A total of 4 blood samples (2 ml each) will be collected at different&#xD;
      time points during the whole study period. Each will be collected from every child at the&#xD;
      beginning of stabilization phase, prior to intervention; end of first month of intervention&#xD;
      and just after the intervention is complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assuming 62 study participants / arm, a total of 496 plasma samples will be collected in this&#xD;
      study. Along with that, 5 ml of blood samples will be collected from the mothers at the&#xD;
      beginning of stabilization phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maternal nutritional status is associated with child nutritional status, as shown through the&#xD;
      results of our eight country MAL-ED study. In addition, antenatal and maternal factors were&#xD;
      early determinants of lower length-for-age, and their contribution remained important&#xD;
      throughout the first 24 months of life. As such, we will record maternal height and weight.&#xD;
      In order to understand the biological state of nutrition of the mother, enrolment samples of&#xD;
      stool, blood and urine will be asked of the mother. These samples will be analyzed for gut&#xD;
      microbiota, and proteomics, and the results correlated with those of the enrolled children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometry The age of the child will be verified against documentation (birth certificate&#xD;
      or immunization card, if available) or caregiver's report of the child's birth date. Length&#xD;
      will be measured by a infantometer sensitive to 0.1 cm. Body weight will be measured by a&#xD;
      balance sensitive to 2g (SECA 7281321009, Hamburg, Germany). Length-for-age (LAZ),&#xD;
      weight-for-length (WLZ) and weight-for-Age (WAZ) Z-scores will be calculated following the&#xD;
      Multicentre Growth Reference Study (MGRS) WHO growth standards. Edema will be examined by&#xD;
      pressing the upper side of both feet for 3 seconds. Mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) will&#xD;
      be measured using TALC MUAC tape (UK). Regular standardization of the measuring equipments&#xD;
      will be done using standards everyday by trained field research assistant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses of plasma and fecal samples Plasma samples collected from this trial will be sent to&#xD;
      Dr Jeffrey Gordon's lab in the Center for Genome Sciences and Systems Biology at Washington&#xD;
      University in St. Louis. Advanced mass spectroscopic- and immunoassay-based methods will be&#xD;
      used to obtain new knowledge about the role of gut microbiota immaturity and the effects of&#xD;
      attempting acute repair of this immaturity with lead microbiota-directed complementary food&#xD;
      (MDCF-2) on biomarkers and mediators of healthy growth. Comparisons will be made with the&#xD;
      control group (i.e., those consuming reference RUSF standard). Targeted Ultra Performance&#xD;
      Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (UPLC-MS) and Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry&#xD;
      (GC-MS) will be used to profile analytes of specific interest in plasma and/or fecal samples&#xD;
      including bile acids and short chain fatty acids (SCFAs); markers of mitochondrial function&#xD;
      (e.g., β-hydroxybutyrate, acylcarnitines/acylCoAs, TCA cycle intermediates); amino acids in&#xD;
      serum plus fecal samples [branch chain amino acids, tryptophan and tryptophan metabolites&#xD;
      related to growth and inflammatory status, including those produced by bacterial tryptophan&#xD;
      metabolism (e.g. indole acetic acid derivatives)]. In addition, key mediators/biomarkers of&#xD;
      linear growth (e.g., growth hormone and IGF-1), energy utilization (insulin, leptin), and&#xD;
      bone biology [IL-6 (interleukin-6), osteoprotegerin, the C-terminal peptide of type I&#xD;
      collagen (CTX, a marker of osteoclast activity/bone resorption), and the amino-terminal&#xD;
      propeptide of Type 1 procollagen (P1NP, a marker of osteoblast activity/bone formation)], and&#xD;
      systemic inflammation (CRP, AGP) will be quantified using established ELISA/Luminex assays.&#xD;
      Proteins in blood will be identified using the SOMAlogic scan that permits identification of&#xD;
      more than 1300 different proteins. The proteomic study done on plasma samples from children&#xD;
      with SAM in our previous Pre-POC trial done in Dhaka has already demonstrated a number of&#xD;
      significant and clinically relevant associations between certain proteins and clinical&#xD;
      phenotypes using the SOMAlogic scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information gathered will be used to select human fecal samples for transplantation into&#xD;
      germ-free animals; these animals, who will be fed the diets of their human microbiota donors,&#xD;
      will be used to further characterize the mechanisms that link MDCF-2 prototypes, the gut&#xD;
      microbiota, and host physiology/metabolism. In addition, these plasma and fecal biomarkers&#xD;
      will be used to determine that MDCF-2 promotes repair of microbiota immaturity and improves&#xD;
      biological state in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Calculation In the pre-POC trial of different MDCFs, the baseline&#xD;
      weight-for-length Z score of children who received MDCF2 (Microbiota Directed Complementary&#xD;
      Food 2) was -2.2 and after one month of supplementation was -1.7. If we consider the WLZ -2&#xD;
      at baseline and -1.7 at end line, pooled SD (standard deviation) as 0.53 then the sample size&#xD;
      is 49 in each arm at 80% power and 5% level of significance. With 20% attrition 62 children&#xD;
      will be required to be enrolled in each arm. Therefore, for this trial, 62 children will&#xD;
      receive MDCF-2 and 62 children Rice-lentil RUSF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two groups of children with Post SAM-MAM will be compared at baseline and at different&#xD;
      time points as shown in the illustration on trial design. The clinical outcome variables for&#xD;
      comparison will include rate of weight gain, anthropometric indices, and morbidity. All&#xD;
      analytes mentioned in the section 'Analyses of plasma and fecal samples' will be compared&#xD;
      between MDCF-2 and RUSF groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Assurance for Protection of Human rights The study has been started after obtaining&#xD;
      IRB (Institutional Review Board ) approval by the icddr,b Research Review Committee and&#xD;
      Ethical Review Committee. Before enrolment in the study, informed written consent are being&#xD;
      taken from the legal guardian of the study participants. Personal identifications taken&#xD;
      during enrolment and other study procedures are being kept under lock and key.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected risks/adverse events for this protocol are those related to blood sample collection,&#xD;
      fecal sample collection and feeding of microbiota directed complementary food. None of these&#xD;
      qualify as a serious adverse event (SAE). Expected Adverse Events (EAEs) related to blood&#xD;
      draw are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  discomfort&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  pain&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  introduction of infection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  bleeding&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  fainting or bruising&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Precaution will be taken to avoid introduction of infection by disinfecting the&#xD;
                site of venipuncture and using sterile equipment&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The risk of bleeding and bruising will be minimized by immediate application of&#xD;
                pressure after venipuncture&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The participant (child) will be in the sitting or supine position during blood&#xD;
                draws to avoid injuries from fainting&#xD;
&#xD;
      All possible adverse events will be treated appropriately. These will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vomiting&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diarrhoea&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Skin rash&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urticaria from food allergy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Abdominal distension&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pain abdomen Assessment of Adverse Events Both serious and non-serious adverse events&#xD;
           will be assessed for severity; relationship to study participation; actions taken; and&#xD;
           outcomes. All SAEs must be reported to the ERC (Ethical Review Committee) of icddr,b&#xD;
           within 24 hours of the site's awareness of the event that will in turn be distributed to&#xD;
           the sponsor. This will be done by direct telephone communication, fax or e-mail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      icddr,b IRB recommended guidelines would be followed for grading the adverse events, if any&#xD;
      that take place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severity:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Mild&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Moderate&#xD;

&#xD;
      Resolved Continuing Unknown Collaborative Arrangements This project is a collaborative effort&#xD;
      between the investigators at the Washington University School of Medicine and the&#xD;
      International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b). The clinical&#xD;
      works, field activities will be undertaken in Dhaka and Kurigram, Bangladesh, under the&#xD;
      direct supervision of the Principal Investigator whereas the laboratory analyses will be&#xD;
      conducted at the Gordon Lab at Washington University in St. Louis. All research units and the&#xD;
      collaborating investigators have long histories of international collaborations. All&#xD;
      investigators have communicated during development of this project and are committed to its&#xD;
      successful implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Facilities Available icddr,b has a well-equipped Food Processing Lab that will facilitate&#xD;
      experiments on the diet recipes. We have ongoing studies in the Baoniabad area in Mirpur. A&#xD;
      number of project offices are located there. More importantly, we have an excellent rapport&#xD;
      with the community. The Terre des Hommes that runs the SNU in Kurigram where a part of the&#xD;
      trial will be conducted. In the past we helped in the development of the SNU and have&#xD;
      performed studies there. The SNU has a great reputation in the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Center for Genome Sciences, Washington University in St. Louis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The stool samples will be aliquoted at icddr,b. Stool samples will be sent to Prof Jeffery&#xD;
      Gordon's Lab in St Louis for the high throughput 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. The&#xD;
      presence/abundances of a broad range of enteropathogens in stool samples before and after&#xD;
      MDCF-2 treatment will be determined using a PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction)-based assay.&#xD;
      Stool samples may also be used to culture constituent bacterial strains for use in future&#xD;
      studies in gnotobiotic mice in the Gordon Lab. It is pertinent to mention here that the&#xD;
      assays and equipment to carry out those are currently available only in a few labs in the&#xD;
      world, including the one at St Louis. The Center is home to an interdisciplinary,&#xD;
      multi-departmental, multi-generational team of investigators from multiple schools that focus&#xD;
      on comparative genomics, statistical genomics, and systems biology It serves as 'proving&#xD;
      ground' for developing new strategies for educating students and faculty who wish to work at&#xD;
      the interface of the biological, physical, computational and engineering sciences.&#xD;
