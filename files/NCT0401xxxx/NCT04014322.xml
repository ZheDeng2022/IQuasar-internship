    <textblock>
      This study aims to establish the feasibility and acceptability of a project designed to&#xD;
      investigate the impact of electronic cigarette use on combustible cigarette smoking and&#xD;
      smoking-related factors among smokers with psychiatric disorders, a high-risk population, who&#xD;
      are not yet ready to quit smoking. All participants will be instructed to switch completely&#xD;
      from combustible cigarettes to e-cigarettes for the next 8 weeks. They will be assessed at&#xD;
      baseline, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 8 weeks and 12 weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, the prevalence of e-cigarette use has rapidly increased, especially among&#xD;
      those with psychiatric conditions, and the risks and potential benefits of e-cigarette use&#xD;
      have been the topic of much debate. More research is needed to understand the impact of&#xD;
      e-cigarette use on smoking behavior and smoking-related cognitions among individuals with&#xD;
      psychiatric conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will investigate the effects of e-cigarette use on cigarette smoking and&#xD;
      motivation/readiness to quit among smokers with psychiatric disorders who are not yet ready&#xD;
      to quit smoking. A total of 50 adult daily cigarette smokers who are receiving outpatient&#xD;
      psychiatric treatment and not yet ready to quit smoking will be recruited. All participants&#xD;
      will be instructed to switch completely from combustible cigarettes to e-cigarettes for the&#xD;
      next 8 weeks. E-cigarettes will be provided to participants at no cost. Participants will&#xD;
      also be asked to complete 5 (remote and in-person) assessment sessions (i.e., baseline,&#xD;
      2-week, 4-week, 8-week and 12-week follow-ups).&#xD;
