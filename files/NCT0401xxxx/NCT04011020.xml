  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a T cell-mediated autoimmune disease that causes a deficit of&#xD;
      pancreatic islet beta cells. Millions of individuals worldwide have T1D, and incidence&#xD;
      increases annually. Several recent clinical trials point to the need for an approach that&#xD;
      produces comprehensive immune modulation at both the local pancreatic and systemic levels.&#xD;
      Stem Cell Educator (SCE) therapy offers comprehensive immune modulation at both the local and&#xD;
      systemic levels in T1D by using a patient's own immune cells (including platelets) that are&#xD;
      &quot;educated&quot; by cord blood stem cells. Tested clinically in more than 200 patients, SCE therapy&#xD;
      has shown lasting reversal in autoimmunity in T1D patients, including improved C-peptide&#xD;
      levels, reduced median glycated hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) values, and decreased median daily&#xD;
      usage of insulin. SCE therapy circulates a patient's blood through a blood cell separator,&#xD;
      briefly cocultures the patient's immune cells with adherent Cord Blood Stem Cells (CB-SCs) in&#xD;
      vitro, and returns the &quot;educated&quot; autologous immune cells to the patient's circulation.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The SCE device is made of a hydrophobic material from FDA-approved (USP Class VI) dishes that&#xD;
      tightly binds stem cells CB-SCs without interfering with their immune modulating capability.&#xD;
      We originally designed a chamber for co-culture of lymphocytes and CB-SCs that included nine&#xD;
      discs of the material with a flow pathway and adherent CB-SCs sandwiched between a top cover&#xD;
      plate and a bottom collecting plate. In this trial, we are going to use the 12-layer SCE&#xD;
      device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SCE therapy carried a lower risk of infection than a typical blood transfusion, and did&#xD;
      not introduce stem cells or reagents into the patients. In addition, CB-SCs have very low&#xD;
      immunogenicity, and the CB-SCs cultured in the device are a highly restricted population and&#xD;
      contain no CD3+ T cells or other lymphocyte subsets, eliminating the need for human leukocyte&#xD;
      antigen (HLA) matching prior to treatment. This innovative approach has the potential to&#xD;
      provide CB-SC-mediated immune modulation therapy for multiple autoimmune diseases while&#xD;
      mitigating the safety and ethical concerns associated with other approaches such as T1D, type&#xD;
      2 diabetes (T2D), and alopecia areata (AA) in clinics. The relative simplicity of the&#xD;
      approach may also provide cost and time savings relative to other approaches.&#xD;

    <description>Patients with T1D will be evaluated by the study principal investigator or co-investigators. Informed consent will be obtained at the initial screening visit. The initial screening visit will occur within 30 days of initiation of SCE therapy. The second screening visit will occur within 7 days of therapy. Subjects who meet all criteria will be scheduled for treatment. All enrolled subjects will receive treatment with the SCE system consisting of a single session of mononuclear cells (MNC) collection by apheresis where 10 L of blood will be processed on day -1. The MNC product will then be exposed over to the SCE and on day 0 the product will be infused intravenously back to the patient.</description>
