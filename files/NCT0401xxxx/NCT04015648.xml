  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a FIH, open-label, dose escalation, phase I clinical trial to assess the safety and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of the candidate ChAdOx1 Zika vaccine in healthy volunteers given as a&#xD;
      standalone vaccine or in coadministration with ChAdOx1 Chik. Both vaccines will be&#xD;
      administered intramuscularly.&#xD;

      Volunteers will be recruited and vaccinated at the Centre for Clinical Vaccinology and&#xD;
      Tropical Medicine (CCVTM), Oxford. There will be 6 study groups and a total of 48 volunteers&#xD;
      will be enrolled. Groups 1-3 will receive ChAdOx1 Zika alone. Groups 4-6 will receive a&#xD;
      co-administration of ChAdOx1 Zika and ChAdOx1 Chik administered contralaterally. Staggered&#xD;
      enrolment will apply for the first three volunteers within each group.&#xD;
