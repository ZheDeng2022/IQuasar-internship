  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects with resectable melanoma will receive neoadjuvant nivolumab followed by surgical&#xD;
      resection. Post-operatively, subjects will receive open-label treatment with up to 1 year of&#xD;
      adjuvant nivolumab or ipilimumab plus nivolumab as determined by pathologic response at the&#xD;
      time of resection.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects with Stage III resectable melanoma will receive one dose of nivolumab 480 mg IV,&#xD;
      then undergo standard definitive surgery approximately 4 weeks after the initial dose of&#xD;
      nivolumab. Post-operatively, subjects will receive open-label treatment with up to 1 year of&#xD;
      adjuvant nivolumab 480 mg IV every 4 weeks or ipilimumab plus nivolumab, as determined by&#xD;
      pathologic response at the time of resection. Subjects with pathologic complete response or&#xD;
      near pathologic complete response (PathCR/nearCR) (Arm A) receive adjuvant nivolumab for up&#xD;
      to one year. Subjects with &lt;PathCR/nearCR are randomized 1:2 to either adjuvant nivolumab&#xD;
      (480 mg) for up to one year (Arm B) or adjuvant ipilimumab (1mg/kg) plus nivolumab (3mg/kg)&#xD;
      for 4 doses and then nivolumab (480 mg) alone for a total of one year (Arm C).&#xD;

             physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency,&#xD;
             etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;

             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with&#xD;
