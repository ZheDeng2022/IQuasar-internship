      -  Full term pregnant female patients presented for elective C.S for single viable fetus&#xD;
           will be included in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Before anesthesia, the patient will be attached to a monitor of: ECG , heart rate, non&#xD;
           invasive blood pressure, pulse taximeter applied on the index finger of the limb not&#xD;
           attached to the blood pressure cuff, pulse oximetry and plethysmographic variability&#xD;
           index (PVI) and perfusion index (PI) will be taken by (Massimo radical 7, Massimo corp.&#xD;
           USA). Measures will be recorded every 5 minutes preoperative.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with PVI &lt;15 will be excluded from the study.&#xD;

        -  Patients with PVI &gt; 15 are started on intravenous infusion of warm ringer lactate&#xD;
           solution via suitable pore intravenous cannula to reach target of PVI &lt;15 or a total 1&#xD;
           liter of ringer lactate.&#xD;

      -  This prospective observational study will be carried out on all pregnant women who will&#xD;
           undergo elective cesarean section in obstetric department in Tanta university hospitals&#xD;
           under spinal anesthesia over four month duration that starts immediately after obtaining&#xD;
           ethical committee approval, an informed written consent will be included with the&#xD;
           consent for spinal anesthesia for cesarean section, all patients data will be&#xD;
           confidential and will be used for the current study only.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnant women which are listed to undergo elective caeserian section for single viable baby&#xD;
      under spinal anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients with pregnancy less than 36 weeks or more than 40 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients with hypertension , pre-eclampsia , eclampsia.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients with diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients with cardiovascular disease and /or arrhythmia.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients with placenta previa, accreta, percreta.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Obese patients with BMI &gt;36&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Polyhydramnious patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On arrival of patients to pre-anaesthesia preparation room, we will allow patients to&#xD;
           rest in supine position with 15 degree left tilt by pillow wedge under right hip, after&#xD;
           allowing patient to rest for five minutes, measures are recorded: ECG , heart rate, non&#xD;
           invasive blood pressure, pulse oximeter applied on the index finger of the limb not&#xD;
           attached to the blood pressure cuff, pulse oximetry and Plethysmography variability&#xD;
           index (PVI) and perfusion index (PI) will be taken by (Massimo radical 7, Massimo corp.&#xD;
           USA). Measures will be recorded every 5 minutes preoperative. Patients with PVI &lt;15 are&#xD;
           excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with PVI &gt; 15 are started on intravenous infusion of warm ringer lactate solution&#xD;
      via suitable pore intravenous cannula to reach target of PVI &lt;15 or a total 1 liter of ringer&#xD;
      lactate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients in which the PVI is corrected by fluid to level below 15 will be Group (C) or&#xD;
      corrected group. Patients in which intravenous fluid administration did not result any change&#xD;
      in PVI or changed but still higher than 15 will be Group (NC) or non corrected group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After preoperative preparation patient is shifted to operating theater, with all monitors&#xD;
      applied. She will receive spinal block at lumbar 3-4 space with hyperbaric bupivacaine 8 mg&#xD;
      plus 25 mic fentanyl. After giving anesthesia and positioning for surgery with a left lateral&#xD;
      tilt of 15 degrees, supplemental oxygen at rate of 4 liter/minute is applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements will be taken every minute till delivery of the baby, and if the blood pressure&#xD;
      is decreased below 20% of the baseline level before anesthesia, patients will be given&#xD;
      incremental doses of ephedrine sulfate 0.1 mg /kg till blood pressure normalized above 80% of&#xD;
      pre-anesthesia level. All measurements will be recorded in tables and subjected to&#xD;
      statistical analysis.&#xD;
