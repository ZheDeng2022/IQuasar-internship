      This is a prospective, randomized, open-label, exploratory trial of temozolomide-based&#xD;
      chemo-radiotherapy which compares two widely used established radiation schedules with either&#xD;
      40 Gy in 15 fractions or 25 Gy in 5 fractions with concurrent temozolomide for both schedules&#xD;
      in patients with glioblastoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients in the study will receive usual care with short-course radiotherapy (RT) and&#xD;
      TMZ-chemo pills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are three phases of treatment in this study: the Chemo-radiation Phase, the Adjuvant&#xD;
      Phase, and the Follow-Up Phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty-eight or fewer days prior to starting the Chemo-radiation Phase, patients will have a&#xD;
      baseline Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemo-radiation Phase: In this, patient will be assigned to either a one week or a three week&#xD;
      treatment group with radiation treatments given approximately 5 days a week as directed by&#xD;
      the study doctor. During this time they will also take TMZ-chemo orally (by mouth) once a day&#xD;
      on every evening including weekends starting the evening of the day that you start&#xD;
      radiotherapy. Once radiation is completed, you will stop taking TMZ-chemo for approximately 4&#xD;
      weeks before going to the next phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiation therapy: Patients will be randomized between standard radiation treatment at UPMC&#xD;
      Radiation Oncology facilities included in this protocol with either 40 Gy in 15 fractions or&#xD;
      25 Gy in 5 fractions, using 6 to 23 MV x-rays along with concurrent temozolomide chemotherapy&#xD;
      for both treatment schedules.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical treatment volumes (CTV) will include all contrast enhancing tumor plus 1.7cm&#xD;
           expansion into brain tissue (not crossing the tentorium) and all T2 FLAIR hyperintensity&#xD;
           plus 7mm expansion into brain tissue (not crossing the tentorium). A planning target&#xD;
           volume (PTV) expansion of 3mm will be then added to the CTV. No additional exclusion of&#xD;
           brainstem or optic nerves is required as both treatment schedules are within tolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment may be delivered with either 3D-conformal or intensity modulated radiotherapy&#xD;
           (IMRT) techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adjuvant Phase: In the Adjuvant Phase, you will receive standard monthly 5 day cycles of&#xD;
      TMZ-chemo at 150 mg/m^2 per day for up to 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemotherapy: Patient will receive concurrent temozolomide throughout radiation therapy,&#xD;
      followed by standard monthly 5 day cycles for up to 1 year. Patients randomized to 25 Gy in 5&#xD;
      fractions will receive 150 mg/m^2 of temozolomide per day for 5 days starting first day of&#xD;
      radiotherapy. Patients randomized to 40 Gy in 15 fractions will receive 75 mg/m2 of&#xD;
      temozolomide per day for 19 days starting first day of radiotherapy. Patients will be&#xD;
      appropriately pre-medicated with anti-nausea medication, prior to taking temozolomide. All&#xD;
      patients will also receive prophylactic treatment for pneumocystis pneumonia with Bactrim or&#xD;
      other alternative antibiotics if allergic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Interval: Procedures performed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the&#xD;
      study procedures are called &quot;monitoring&quot; or &quot;follow-up&quot; procedures. Subject participants will&#xD;
      not be scheduled for any additional follow-up visits for this study than they would normally&#xD;
      have if they were not in this study. Radiation Oncologists and Neuro-Oncologists usually see&#xD;
      their patients one month after the first chemo-radiotherapy cycle before starting the next&#xD;
      cycle of chemotherapy. After that Neuro-Oncologists and Radiation Oncologists will see the&#xD;
      patients every 1-3 months.&#xD;
