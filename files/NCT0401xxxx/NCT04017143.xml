  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The specific aims are: 1) to design a multilevel, theory-driven, highly interactive,&#xD;
      culturally and cognitively tailored hAppy app intervention to facilitate HPV vaccination&#xD;
      completion among Hmong adolescents and their parents using CBPAR; 2) establish a systematic&#xD;
      health care provider protocol for identifying and engaging Hmong adolescents and their&#xD;
      parents in the use of the hAppy app; and 3) examine participants' intent, knowledge and&#xD;
      self-efficacy of HPV vaccinations, perceptions of the hAppy app and their patient-provider&#xD;
      experiences. This study will advance existing knowledge of mHealth's impact on populations at&#xD;
      risk for cancer and contribute new, important information to cancer health disparities&#xD;
      research. If found to be effective, this intervention will have extensive implications for&#xD;
      prevention of other types of cancer among different underserved populations, potentially&#xD;
      reducing cancer-related disparities, morbidity, and mortality.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A quarter million Hmong Americans (Hmong) reside in the United States and 25% live in the&#xD;
      Twin Cities metropolitan area. With a median age of 20.4 years old, this young community has&#xD;
      a poverty rate of 26% in Minnesota and 27.4% nationally. Cervical cancer knowledge and&#xD;
      prevention, such as awareness of HPV's effectiveness in reducing cancer risk, is low among&#xD;
      Hmong women (19-50%) and men (38%), which may explain Hmong's high cervical cancer incidence&#xD;
      rates (three times higher than other Asian Americans (AA) and four times higher than&#xD;
      Non-Hispanic Whites). This problem is further aggravated by the rise of cervical cancer&#xD;
      incidence and mortality rates among Hmong women. Clearly, multilevel strategies to increase&#xD;
      HPV vaccination rates and reduce HPV-related cancers among Hmong are urgently needed. Yet&#xD;
      Hmong women face structural and cultural barriers that limit their access to preventive&#xD;
      health care. Language difficulties, poor health literacy, lack of time or transportation,&#xD;
      visiting a doctor only when symptomatic or in pain and abstaining from gynecological visits&#xD;
      due to embarrassment are some of these barriers. These barriers and beliefs must be carefully&#xD;
      integrated into the design of any effective multilevel strategy to promote HPV vaccination&#xD;
      uptake and completion. This study proposes to use a Community-Based Participatory Action&#xD;
      Research (CBPAR) approach to develop and test the effectiveness of a theory-based culturally&#xD;
      and cognitively appropriate mobile application (hAppy app) intervention that facilitate HPV&#xD;
      vaccination completion among Hmong adolescents (11 to 17 years old) and their parents. Mobile&#xD;
      health (mHealth) technology is a promising tool allowing for effective person-centered&#xD;
      customization. The study's primary objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of hAppy app&#xD;
      intervention in Hmong adolescents and their parents. 100 Hmong adolescents and their parents&#xD;
      will be recruited and a single blind, two arm, randomized controlled trial will be conducted.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized by a 1:1 ratio to receive the hAppy app intervention (N=50)&#xD;
      or usual care (UC, N=50) for a 9-month period.&#xD;
