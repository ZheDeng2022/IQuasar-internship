    <measure>Sum of Pain Intensity Difference from 0 to 24 hours (SPID24) based on the 11 point Numeric Pain Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>0 to 24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Pain Intensity will be self-reported over 24 hours, using a pain rating of 0-10 on the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), with score between 0-10 (0= no pain; 10 = worst imaginable pain). SPID is calculated as Σ[T(i) -T(i-1)] x [(PID(i-1) + PID(i))/2], where T(0)=0, T(i) is the scheduled time, and PID(i) is the pain intensity difference (PID) score at time i.</description>

    <description>Pain Relief Rating (PR) will be scored on a 5-point scale (0=no-, 1=a little-, 2=some-, 3=a lot of-, and 4=complete- PR). TOTPAR24 is calculated as SUM([T(i) - T(i-1)] x (PR(i-1) + PR(i)) / 2), where T(0)=0, T(i) is the actual time, and PR(i) is the pain relief score at time i. and calculated as Σ[T(i) -T(i-1)] x [(PR(i-1) + PR(i))/2], where T(0)=0, T(i) is the scheduled time, and PR(i) is the pain relief (PR) score at time i.</description>

    <description>Upon initiation of the infusion of Dose 1, the patients will be given a second stopwatch and asked to press the stopwatch if and when they feel any meaningful perceptible relief; a record of the time will be noted in the patient record.&#xD;
If a subject does not record perceptible pain relief and prematurely discontinued from the study prior to 24 hours, then the subject will be censored at time of drop out. If a subject does not record perceptible pain relief prior to taking rescue medication, the subject will be censored at 24 hours.</description>
