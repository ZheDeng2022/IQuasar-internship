  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to compare the safety and effectiveness of Biosure Regenesorb&#xD;
      Interference Screw versus BIOSURE HA Interference Screw (control device) in patients&#xD;
      requiring reconstruction of cruciate ligaments of the knee. The trial results will be used&#xD;
      for registration of Biosure Regenesorb Interference Screw in China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary efficacy endpoint of this study is Lysholm score at 12 months after operation.&#xD;
      The non-inferiority testing is performed for efficiency of primary efficacy endpoint, and the&#xD;
      test hypothesis is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Invalid hypothesis: H0: μ1-μ2 ≤-δ Alternative hypothesis: H1: μ1-μ2 &gt; -δ, where, μ1 and μ2&#xD;
      are the Lysholm scores in the investigational group and control group, respectively. δ is a&#xD;
      non-inferiority critical value.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Lysholm Knee Scoring Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The scale evaluates functions of patients based on 8 questions: limp(5 Points), support(5 Points), locking(15 Points), instability(25 Points), pain(25 Points),swelling(10 Points), stair climbing(10 Points) and squatting(5 Points). The total Lysholm Knee score is summed up all points of 8 questions. The score will range from 0 to 100 Points. Higher values represent a better outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-Operation, Post-Operation 6 months, 12 months, 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The scale is composed of a knee evaluation form (10 items) and a knee ligament examination form (8 items), involving joint pain, sport level and ability of daily activities. The total score is 0-100.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Drawer test</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-Operation, Post-Operation 6 months, 12 months, 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Anterior drawer test: It is used for ACL examination. The patient will be diagnosed with forward straight instability if the tibia is forward displaced 5 mm more than the uninjured side. Posterior drawer test: It is used for PCL examination. The posterior displacement of the tibia along the femur suggests partial or complete CL rupture.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Lachman Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-Operation, Post-Operation 6 months, 12 months, 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Lachman test is carried out at injured and uninjured sides simultaneously. The patient should be supine with the knees flexed to 20-30 degrees and the injured limb slightly rotated outward. The examiner stands beside the injured side, immobilizes the lower end of the femur with one hand, and presses the posterior side of the upper end of the tibia forward (Lachman test) or backward (reverse Lachman test). A positive test result is got. Positive results suggest ACL or PCL injury.</description>

    <description>The Biosure Regenesorb Interference Screw, an absorbable screw designed with an open structure and made of biocomposite material made of PLGA, β-TCP and calcium sulfate, is used to fix ligaments, tendons, soft tissues or bone-tendon-bone grafts in knee surgery. Its open structural design enables rapid bone ingrowth to make the screw integrated with bone tissues so as to promote healing.</description>

    <description>BIOSURE HA Interference Screws and Drivers are designed for durability and reduced screw breakage. Both the screws and driver have been enhanced to allow screws to fully seat on the driver all the way to the tip of the screw, helping stress distribution and force transfer. The screw design also incorporates a consistent wall thickness throughout the length of the screw for added durability and features a tapered body for ideal ease of insertion.</description>
