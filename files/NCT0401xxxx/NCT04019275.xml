  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-site single-arm community-based pilot study examining the feasibility,&#xD;
      acceptability, safety, and estimated effects of the ENGAGE intervention, a community-based&#xD;
      intervention to promote community participation after stroke. The study will also&#xD;
      characterize variances in changes in community participation outcomes. These findings will&#xD;
      provide the pilot data needed to inform a multi-site randomized controlled clinical trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Significant advancements in acute medical management have shifted stroke from an acute&#xD;
      condition with a high prevalence of mortality to a chronic condition with high prevalence of&#xD;
      morbidity. One of the leading causes of chronic illness and disability worldwide, stroke&#xD;
      results in residual sensorimotor, cognition, and communication impairments. These impairments&#xD;
      reduce over time, but few people have complete restoration of function. Hence, people with&#xD;
      stroke-related disability do not resume pre-stroke levels of community participation&#xD;
      (education; paid or volunteer work; civic, social, and religious activities; and leisure).&#xD;
      Low levels of community participation are associated with inactivity, sedentary behavior, and&#xD;
      social isolation, each contributors to cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, pulmonary&#xD;
      conditions, depression - and secondary stroke. These consequences are particularly&#xD;
      problematic for people with low income who have limited resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators at the University of Pittsburgh, Washington University, and the University of&#xD;
      Illinois at Chicago have designed a self-management training program that uses social&#xD;
      learning, motivational interviewing, and guided discovery to help people with mild to&#xD;
      moderate stroke-related disability resume community participation, and to develop a strong&#xD;
      network of social support. However, the combination of these elements has yet to be studied&#xD;
      in people with chronic stroke-related disability who live with low income - one of the most&#xD;
      vulnerable segments of the population. By partnering with the Community Research Fellows&#xD;
      Program at Washington University and the Community PARTners Program at the University of&#xD;
      Pittsburgh, this multi-site team seeks to design and implement a culturally-responsive&#xD;
      program to promote community participation among people with stroke-related disability and&#xD;
      low income. This new collaboration is the next logical step in the development and&#xD;
      examination of community-based interventions to promote self-management and community&#xD;
      participation after stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall purpose of this research study is to examine the feasibility, safety, and&#xD;
      acceptability of a multi-site community-based intervention to promote self-management of&#xD;
      community participation after stroke, with a particular focus on the needs of people with low&#xD;
      income. The study will also characterize variances in intervention response.&#xD;
