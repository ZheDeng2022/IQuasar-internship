  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A common complication following total knee replacement (TKR) is arthrofibrosis, a severe&#xD;
      stiffening of the knee caused by scar tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this mixed methods feasibility study are to (1) record the effect of use of the&#xD;
      STAK Tool on knee flexion active range of movement (KROM) immediately following 8 weeks use&#xD;
      and 6 months following use, (2) explore patients' experiences of arthrofibrosis and use of&#xD;
      the STAK Tool, (3) Consider appropriate outcome measures (e.g. KROM, patient&#xD;
      experience/acceptability, The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index&#xD;
      (WOMAC), Oxford Knee Score (OKS) and other clinical measures and (4) design a protocol to&#xD;
      evaluate the effectiveness of the STAK Tool.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Arthrofibrosis most commonly occurs after total knee replacement (TKR), extensive&#xD;
      intra-articular injury or surgical procedures, for example fracture of the proximal tibia or&#xD;
      distal femur or multiple ligament reconstructions (Creighton and Bach 2012). Arthrofibrosis&#xD;
      involves a severe stiffening of the knee caused by scar tissue. This often results in a lack&#xD;
      of crucial range of knee flexion movement. Traditional physiotherapy treatment includes a&#xD;
      home exercise programme involving regular intense stretches and mobilisations delivered by&#xD;
      the physiotherapist at the hospital aiming to enable the patient to regain optimal,&#xD;
      functional knee bend. The inflammatory process and remodeling of soft tissues following&#xD;
      trauma can lead to production of scar tissue and subsequent stiffness. This results in&#xD;
      increased pain and difficulty in performing exercises. This often limits progress requiring&#xD;
      high numbers of physiotherapy sessions and potentially further surgery (manipulation under&#xD;
      anaesthetic) to restore range of movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The STAK Tool enables the patient to perform intense self-stretching of the knee more easily&#xD;
      and effectively. Intense stretching is essential to increase KROM (Bonutti et al 2008,&#xD;
      Bonutti 2010, Papotto et al 2012, Stephenson et al 2010). Patients who fall into the category&#xD;
      of having restricted KROM (less than 70 degrees flexion) and those whose Clinicians identify&#xD;
      them as requiring further intensive physiotherapy to address their stiffness would be&#xD;
      approached to take part in this study. 36 participants would be recruited. Participants would&#xD;
      be over 18 years old, between 44kg and 159kg. This mixed methods feasibility study would&#xD;
      investigate patients' progress and outcomes in overcoming arthrofibrosis using the STAK Tool&#xD;
      a medical stretching device at home plus standard physiotherapy treatment (intervention&#xD;
      group), compared to patients receiving physiotherapy treatment only (comparative group).&#xD;
      Participants would be allocated into either the intervention or comparative group.&#xD;
      Participants would be instructed to use the STAK Tool for 5-10 minute periods for a minimum&#xD;
      total of 20 minutes and maximum of 60 minutes a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants would receive their standard physiotherapy treatment including KROM, full weight&#xD;
      bearing exercises including sit to stands, squats, body weight assisted passive stretches,&#xD;
      strengthening exercises and mobilisations. Angle of knee flexion would be measured&#xD;
      (standardised method) by the Principal Investigator and the WOMAC and OKS are administered on&#xD;
      the day the participant consents to the study (Visit 1), the day the intervention starts.&#xD;
      This will be within approximately 2 weeks of the patient being identified by their clinician.&#xD;
      (The Principal investigator will visit the participant within 10 days to ensure there are no&#xD;
      problems using the STAK Tool (Visit 2 - only intervention group). During Visit 1 an interview&#xD;
      (interview 1), would be conducted to explore the patients' initial thoughts on the STAK Tool&#xD;
      after being introduced to it. Both the intervention and comparative groups will have their&#xD;
      KROM recorded using two different measuring instruments, the universal goniometer and the&#xD;
      Hudl Ubersense App. Outcome measures including KROM, WOMAC and OKS will be recorded again&#xD;
      following approximately 8 weeks treatment (dependent on time available before manipulation as&#xD;
      per normal clinical care), at either the patient's final follow-up with their Clinician or at&#xD;
      their home (Visit 3) (end of intervention). The WOMAC and OKS would help to ascertain the&#xD;
      patient's perceptions of pain, stiffness and functional improvements. At Visit 3 participants&#xD;
      would also complete a questionnaire regarding the frequency of knee stretching exercise&#xD;
      completed and how easy/difficult it had been to achieve. On completing 8 weeks standard&#xD;
      treatment patients in the comparative group who were deemed eligibility by their Clinician&#xD;
      would be offered the STAK Tool 8 week treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits would then be completed as per the intervention group minus the interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An in-depth semi-structured interview (interview 2) will be conducted with participants in&#xD;
      the intervention group exploring their thoughts and experiences of using the STAK Tool to&#xD;
      increase their knee flexion, their perceived progress and acceptability of the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A follow up meeting (Visit 4) would take place at 6 months after Visit 3, this would take&#xD;
      place at the participant's home patients KROM, WOMAC and OKS would be recorded to provide&#xD;
      data relating to participants long term outcomes.&#xD;
