    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia with a prevalence of&#xD;
      2% in general population. Incidence and prevalence of AF has been slightly increasing due to&#xD;
      increasing age, improved ability to treat cardiac diseases, and higher incidence of obesity&#xD;
      and other risk factors associated with AF. AF is associated with higher morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality mainly caused by heart failure and stroke. Catheter ablation (with pulmonary vein&#xD;
      isolation as a cornerstone) presents the most effective treatment method of AF. Recent&#xD;
      observational studies have shown that intensive risk factor and lifestyle modifications, such&#xD;
      as weight loss, reduced alcohol intake, and increased physical activity, are also associated&#xD;
      with improved rhythm outocome. Head-to-head comparison of this very different methods has not&#xD;
      been done yet. The aim of the project is to compare the effect of catheter ablation with&#xD;
      lifestyle modification (risk factor modification) in a prospective, randomized, multicenter&#xD;
      study on the maintenance of sinus rhythm (monitored using implantable ECG reveal), and on the&#xD;
      progression of the fibrosis of the left ventricle.&#xD;

      GOALS OF THE PROJECT The aim of our study is to compare the effect of the invasive strategy&#xD;
      (catheter ablation) of atrial fibrillation with non-invasive strategy (non-amiodarone&#xD;
      antiarrhythmic drugs with risk factor modification) in a prospective, multicenter,&#xD;
      randomized, non-inferiority study. The main hypothesis is that strict risk factor&#xD;
      modification (weight loss, physical exercise improvement, and alcohol reduction) with AADs in&#xD;
      patients with AF will be associated with similar rhythm outcomes as catheter ablation. Beside&#xD;
      the AF-recurrence as the primary endpoint, the secondary endpoints will be the AF burden&#xD;
      (assessed using repeated Holter recordings), change in cardiorespiratory exercise (assessed&#xD;
      using cardiopulmonary exercise test), MRI endpoints (diffuse myocardial fibrosis, epicardial&#xD;
      adipose tissue), QoL (assessed using specific questionaiires), and metabolic endpoints&#xD;
      (lipids, pro-inflammatory cytokines),&#xD;
&#xD;
      JUSTIFICATION OF THE PROJECT The main reason for the project is the large and ever-increasing&#xD;
      number of AF patients, especially in light of the significant incidence of obesity in AF&#xD;
      patients. Keeping in mind the high number of AF patients (≈ 2% of the population), its&#xD;
      increasing incidence and prevalence, even if CAs were associated with a 100% success rate, it&#xD;
      would be impossible to treat all AF patients using CA. A significant portion of patients with&#xD;
      AF are obese. For instance, the median BMI was 29.2 in the EAST-AFNET Trial and 30 in the&#xD;
      CABANA Trial. Furthermore, and this is the second reason for the project, a significant&#xD;
      portion of AF patients are afraid of invasive procedures and would prefer a noninvasive&#xD;
      approach if the efficacy of this approach is known. The third reason is to compare the effect&#xD;
      of these two different methods on the structural and metabolic abnormalities associated with&#xD;
      AF and obesity&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS The study is planned as prospective, multicenter, randomized, non-inferiority trial&#xD;
      comparing two different approaches in the treatment of AF. Symptomatic AF patients indicated&#xD;
      for rhythm control strategy (i.e. restoriation and maintenance of SR) will be enrolled and&#xD;
      randomized to catheter ablation or risk factor modification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population - inclusion criteria (all of three have to be met for enrollment) (i)&#xD;
      symptomatic AF (paroxysmal, persistent, or long-standing persistent), and (ii) BMI ≥ 30, and&#xD;
      (iii) signed informed content&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population - exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  permanent AF&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  severe valve disease (significant aortic stenosis, mitral regurgitation ≥ 3)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 40%&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  severe pulmonary hypertension (PAP &gt; 40 mm Hg)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  history of tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  planned revascularization&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  left atrial size ≥ 60 mm&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BMI less than 30, or BMI ≥ 40&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  indication for surgical treatment of obesity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  age ≥ 75 let&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a significant physical limitation that could affect physical activity (musculoskeletal&#xD;
           disorders, COPD)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  life expectancy less than 2 years Patients with significant structural heart disease&#xD;
           (left ventricular dysfunction, significant valve disease, moderate or severe pulmonary&#xD;
           hypertension, significant left atrial dilation) will be excluded. Also, patients who&#xD;
           could not actively participate (musculoskeletal disorders, heart failure, patients older&#xD;
           than 75 years) in regular physical activity will be excluded. Diabetes will be an&#xD;
           exclusion criterion because of significant interference associated with antidiabetic&#xD;
           medication relative to some of the endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BASELINE DIAGNOSTIC EXAMINATION After informed content is given, all patients will undergo&#xD;
      baseline anthropometric measurements and baseline examinations. It will include (1) baseline&#xD;
      evaluation of physical fitness - functional diagnostic, (2) echocardiography, (3) quality of&#xD;
      life analysis, (4) blood biochemistry and cytokine analysis, and (5) a baseline one-week ECG&#xD;
      Holter recording, (6) cardiac MRI. All these examinations will be done within four weeks&#xD;
      after randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional diagnostic (anthropometric measurement and cardiopulmonary exercise test) After&#xD;
      enrollment, standard anthropometric measurements will be gathered, i.e., height, weight,&#xD;
      percentage of body fat, and waist-to-hip ratio measurements. Functional diagnostics will be&#xD;
      performed in all patients. Based on the results of functional diagnostics, an individualized&#xD;
      and optimized physical training program will be prepared in patients randomized to the RFM&#xD;
      arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An initial maximum symptom limited cardiopulmonary exercise test (CEPT) will be carried out&#xD;
      within one month of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) CMR will be done using 1.5 Tesla scanners located at each of&#xD;
      the three participating centers. Before CMR evaluation, the ventricular rate will be&#xD;
      optimized with a target ventricular rate &lt; 100/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RANDOMIZATION Patients will be randomized to the catheter ablation group (CA) or risk factor&#xD;
      modification group plus AADs (RFM) in a 1:1 ratio; randomization will be done using&#xD;
      randomization software that will account for age, initial BMI, and AF type, with the goal of&#xD;
      having comparable groups relative to those characteristics. The randomization process will be&#xD;
      done outside all participating centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TREEATMENTS A. Catheter ablation (CA) arm CA will be done within two months of randomization.&#xD;
      In patients with paroxysmal AF, a PVI will be performed. In patients with non-paroxysmal AF&#xD;
      forms, additional lesion sets, except for a PVI, will be allowed according to the practice of&#xD;
      each participating center. The CA will be done using a 3D mapping system, intracardiac&#xD;
      echocardiography, contact-force sensing ablation catheters, and ablation index to achieve the&#xD;
      maximum available safety and to allow for the delivery of maximally effective ablation&#xD;
      lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first three months following catheter ablation will be considered as a &quot;blanking period,&quot;&#xD;
      i.e., AF reoccurrences won´t be assessed as an endpoint. If AF reoccurs during this period,&#xD;
      treatment using AADs or cardioversion will be allowed. Three months after ablation, AADs will&#xD;
      be discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Risk factor modification and antiarrhythmic drugs arm (RFM arm)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim will be (1) a 10% weight loss over 6-12 months,(2) an increase in physical fitness,&#xD;
      and (3) a reduction in alcohol consumption. Nutritional intervention: the initial patient&#xD;
      consultations with nutritional specialists will be done during the first month after&#xD;
      enrollment. A low-calorie, high protein, and low glycemic index dietary menu will be&#xD;
      suggested and optimized by a nutritional specialist for each patient. Patients will have&#xD;
      regular consultations with dietary specialists at least once a month during in-person visits&#xD;
      in the early follow-up or by phone visits later during the follow-up; however, non-planned&#xD;
      dietary consultations will be available every working day by calling a dietary specialist or&#xD;
      using mobile application. Moreover, patients will be encouraged to record the calory intake&#xD;
      in the OBEFIS application (either on the web www.obefis.cz, or using the mobile application)&#xD;
      on a daily basis, and the recordings will be discussed during the visits with dietary&#xD;
      specialists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will have an initial consultation with a physiotherapist (after the CPET) to set&#xD;
      the type and intensity of the physical intervention. The recommended physical intervention&#xD;
      will consist of three types of activities: (1) regular gym-based training (in small groups or&#xD;
      individual training with trainer),(2i) individual aerobic training (fast walking or similar&#xD;
      aerobic activity), and (3) home-based training: 20 min physical exercise sets. The type and&#xD;
      ratio of the aforementioned physical exercises will be changed over the study period. In the&#xD;
      first three months, there will be more emphasis on regular gym-based training under&#xD;
      surveillance. The goal will be to teach patients how to properly perform all the exercises as&#xD;
      well as assisting patients in getting used to regular exercise. At the end of the third&#xD;
      month, the majority of patients should be accustomed to regular physical activity; the ratio&#xD;
      of types of physical activities will be changed to a greater emphasis on individual physical&#xD;
      activity. However, based on the patient´s experiences with physical activity in the past, and&#xD;
      their options regarding participation in the organized training, activities will be&#xD;
      individualized, and some patients may start the physical activity program individually&#xD;
      without previous participation in group-based or surveillance-based training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intensity and frequency will be set individually based on initial CPET. The ESC&#xD;
      guidelines for obese individuals recommend that a minimum of 150 min/week of&#xD;
      moderate-intensity endurance exercise training should be combined with three weekly sessions&#xD;
      of resistance exercise with the heart rate during the activity being 55-74% of the maximum HR&#xD;
      (31). As such, the physical intervention will be based on regular (mainly moderate, ~ 55-74%&#xD;
      of the maximum HR) intensity aerobic exercise that will be gradually increased from 60&#xD;
      min/week up to 200 min/week (in some individuals up to 300 min/week), and then continued&#xD;
      until the end of the study. Patients will be taught how to use their optimal heart rate for&#xD;
      aerobic exercise; for moderate-intensity training, the heart rate during the activity should&#xD;
      be 55-74% of the max. HR. They will also be warned about exceeding their maximum possible&#xD;
      heart rate (i.e., not exceeding 85% of the maximum heart rate). Since it is known that the&#xD;
      adherence of patients to regular activity is affected by activity monitoring, all patients&#xD;
      will have an opportunity to be monitored during each exercise using remote heart rate&#xD;
      monitoring (fitness bands) and the OBEFIS smartphone application. It also allows monitoring&#xD;
      of the heart rate during activity and an online discussion with therapists during the&#xD;
      follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients in the RFM arm, contrary to patients in the CA arm, non-amiodarone AADs will be&#xD;
      allowed during the whole study period. The reoccurrence as AF/AT as an endpoint will be&#xD;
      considered starting at the 6-month visit, including a 7-day Holter, which is scheduled to be&#xD;
      done at the 6-month visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both arms, in case of a reoccurrence of symptomatic AF or atrial tachycardia (AT), re-do&#xD;
      ablations, cardioversion, or AADs treatment during the follow-up period will be allowed in&#xD;
      accordance with the current guidelines and practices of participating centers. However,&#xD;
      because the indication for the aforementioned procedures or AAD initiation will be a&#xD;
      reoccurrence of AF or AT, it will be assessed as the primary endpoint (i.e., AF&#xD;
      reoccurrence).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTPATIENT FOLLOW-UP The follow-up protocol and ECG monitoring will be similar for both arms.&#xD;
      Starting on the day of the catheter ablation (D0 in the ablation arm), or at the start of the&#xD;
      metabolic activity (D0 in the RFM arm, approx. 3-4 weeks after randomization), follow-up&#xD;
      visits will be scheduled at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months during the first year, and then every six&#xD;
      months. At the 3-month follow-up visit, patients in AF (from both groups) will undergo&#xD;
      electrical cardioversion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A routine 12-lead ECG will be recorded at each follow-up visit, along with a physical&#xD;
      examination of the patient and a medical history update. Long-term ECG recording will be done&#xD;
      using a 7-day Holter recording at baseline, and then at the 6, 9, and 12 months visits during&#xD;
      the first year, and then every six months in the second and third years. Baseline 7-day ECG&#xD;
      Holter recordings will be done in all patients after enrollment and within the first three&#xD;
      weeks for patients on antiarrhythmics before study entry; this will serve as background for&#xD;
      comparisons of AF burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first three months in the CA arm and the first six months in the RFM arm will serve the&#xD;
      blanking period. Starting at 3M (CA) or 6 M control (RFM) control, any reoccurrence of AF/AT&#xD;
      will be considered an endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the 12-month follow-up visit, echocardiography, MRI examination, anthropometric&#xD;
      measurements, and CPET will be done. Blood will be drawn for cytokine analysis, and patients&#xD;
      will also be asked to complete follow-up QoL questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ENDPOINT MONITORING The AF reoccurrence will be detected either using planned 7-day Holter&#xD;
      recordings (at the 6, 9, and 12 m visits), during all planned outpatient visits using a&#xD;
      standard 12-lead ECG, and any time during the follow-up at an emergency non-planned visit&#xD;
      also using a standard 12-lead ECG (starting at the three-month visit in the CA arm and the&#xD;
      six-month visit in the RFM arm). The occurrence of AF &gt; 30 sec during planned 7-day Holter&#xD;
      recordings, either planned or emergency, a non-planned visit will be assessed as a primary&#xD;
      endpoint. Importantly, during all outpatient in-person visits, AF reoccurrence has to be&#xD;
      documented using an ECG (i.e., a patient´s description of &quot;palpitations&quot; without ECG evidence&#xD;
      will not be assessed as AF reoccurrence).&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY OUTCOMES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) AF reoccurrence (any AF or atrial tachycardia lasting more than 30 sec) SECONDARY OUTCOMES&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. AF burden: calculated using all Holter recordings as a percentage of time spent in AF or&#xD;
           AT&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. AF reoccurrence and AF burden at the 12-month visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Hospitalization for AF reoccurrence and/or emergency room visit due to AF&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. A composite of stroke, cardiovascular death, or hospitalization for heart failure&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Changes in QoL questionnaires between baseline and 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Change in cardiorespiratory fitness as assessed using CPET between baseline and 12&#xD;
           months (ml/kg/min)&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Metabolic endpoint: changes in weight, fasting glucose, lipid levels, glycated&#xD;
           hemoglobin, and cytokines associated with inflammation and atrial function&#xD;
           (interleukin-6, natriuretic peptides)&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Imaging endpoints: change in the amoubnt of EAT and % in ventricular fibrosis between&#xD;
           baseline and the 12-month examination (MRI), and a change in left atrial parameters&#xD;
           (echocardiography)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculation and statistical analysis The expected efficacy of the Catheter ablation In&#xD;
      a meta-analysis of RCT comparing CA with AADs, the single procedure success rate of CA OFF&#xD;
      AADs was 57% (96%CI 50-64%) In the CABANA trial, AF freedom was present in 63.6% of the&#xD;
      ablation patients by 12 months. The expected one-year AF freedom in the CA arm is ≈ 60%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected efficacy of AADs and RFM In a meta-analysis of 24 randomized control trials&#xD;
      comparing AADs with placebo, the overall success rate of AADs, defined as the disappearance&#xD;
      of arrhythmia during follow-up, was present in 52% (95%CI 47%-57%) of patients on AADs. The&#xD;
      highest efficacy was achieved using amiodarone (58%), followed by flecainide and propafenone&#xD;
      (48%). In the CABANA trial, by 12 months, the one-year AF freedom on AADs was present in&#xD;
      47.1% of patients. Finally, in the recently published STOP-AF trial, one-year AF freedom&#xD;
      (assessed using repeated 24-Hour Holter recordings) was present in 45.0% (95%CI 34.6-54.7) of&#xD;
      patients, but only 2% were on amiodarone, and the rest were on flecainide, sotalol and&#xD;
      propafenone. Therefore, a one-year AF freedom of 45% could be expected for non-amiodarone&#xD;
      AADs. In the LEGACY study, the achieved AF freedom significantly depended on weight loss.&#xD;
      Relative to weight loss, patients were categorized as &gt;10%, 3%-9%, and &lt; 3% weight loss.&#xD;
      During follow-up, 45.5% patients in the &gt;10%, 22.2% in the 3-9%, and 13.4% in the &lt; 3% group&#xD;
      remained AF-free without AADs or ablation. In the ARREST AF, at the final follow-up (mean&#xD;
      duration 41 months), 32.9% of patients in the RFM arm vs. 9.7% controls remained AF-free&#xD;
      after a single CA procedure. No study has compared the additive effect of weight loss on top&#xD;
      of AADs; however, an additional effect of 20% could be expected in these patients. Therefore,&#xD;
      we expected a ≈ 65% one-year AF freedom in the noninvasive treated patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the aforementioned data, we expect one-year AF freedom in 65% of patients in the&#xD;
      RFM arm and 60% in the CA arm. The primary analysis will be done using the intention-to-treat&#xD;
      principle; however, based on the non-inferiority nature of the study, a per-protocol analysis&#xD;
      will be done. The sample size calculation assumed: 80% power, 5% one-sided alpha, a&#xD;
      non-inferiority margin of 12% (or 1.65, if expressed as an odds ratio). Using this&#xD;
      assumption, 202 patients (101 in each arm) will need to be enrolled to prove non-inferiority&#xD;
      of the noninvasive arm relative to the invasive arm. With an expected drop-out rate of 5%,&#xD;
      therefore, 212 patients will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study organization, randomization process and data management&#xD;
&#xD;
      The institution responsible for the organization and implementation of the study is the 3rd&#xD;
      Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague, Czech Republic. Data obtained during each&#xD;
      patient visit will be collected using a safe electronic CRF form. A tailor-made website was&#xD;
      developed for the study. Each participating medical center will have access to a dedicated&#xD;
      part of the website. The database and randomization software has been prepared by an outside&#xD;
      party (i.e., the Institute of Biostatistics and Analyses, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech&#xD;
      Republic), and no investigator will have access to the database or the randomization&#xD;
      software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety and endpoint monitoring The local investigator at each site will continuously review&#xD;
      safety data during the trial. A Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be constituted&#xD;
      before the commencement of the trial. Reporting of adverse events will be reported to the&#xD;
      DSMB immediately by the principal investigator. Serious adverse events (SAE) will be defined&#xD;
      as life-threatening events or events resulting in death or hospitalization. All SAEs linked&#xD;
      with the study will be reported to the DSMB, to the FNKV Ethics Committee (a multicenter&#xD;
      ethics committee, EC), and to the local ECs within 24 hours of study staff becoming aware of&#xD;
      the event. Clinical endpoints will be analyzed by a dedicated clinical endpoint committee.&#xD;
      The recording and analyses of all Holter recordings in all participating centers will be done&#xD;
      centrally using an MDT (medical data transfer) company.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DISCUSSION In the last five years, lifestyle modification with risk factor management has&#xD;
      been shown to be a very promising treatment modality for AF. AF is the most common sustained&#xD;
      cardiac arrhythmia, with an estimated worldwide prevalence of about 33.5 million people.&#xD;
      According to recent epidemiological studies, its prevalence may triple by 2050 Even if&#xD;
      catheter ablations were associated with a 100% success rate, it would be impossible to treat&#xD;
      the current or projected numbers using catheter ablations. Furthermore, a substantial number&#xD;
      of patients would prefer a non-invasive treatment if both strategies were comparable. So&#xD;
      while risk factor modification studies may seem to offer a panacea, those studies suffer from&#xD;
      significant limitations and possible biases. For example, the most important and most&#xD;
      extensive studies were both non-randomized, and all patients had either a history of catheter&#xD;
      ablation (ARREST-AF) or were without a history of catheter ablation, but catheter ablation&#xD;
      was allowed without limitations, based on the judgment of the attending physician during the&#xD;
      follow-up period (LEGACY). A randomized study that directly compares catheter ablation with a&#xD;
      modern noninvasive strategy has yet to be done. If the effect of both strategies were&#xD;
      comparable, the noninvasive strategy could be offered to patients with a preference for a&#xD;
      noninvasive treatment. Only a randomized study can really answer the question of how&#xD;
      effective lifestyle modification is supported by safe non-amiodarone AADs compared to a&#xD;
      modern invasive strategy. Additionally, a randomized study has the potential to show the&#xD;
      additional effect of both strategies (effect on CMR measures or pro-inflammatory cytokines&#xD;
      concentrations) and to determine which patients would most likely benefit from a non-invasive&#xD;
      treatment, thus increasing the number of successfully treated AF patients, without the use of&#xD;
      invasive methods.&#xD;
