  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is well known that following a single session of moderate-to-high intensity exercise&#xD;
      individuals experience a temporary suppression of hunger and a delay in the commencement of&#xD;
      eating. This effect is believed to be due to changes in blood concentrations of specific&#xD;
      hormones released from the gut that influence appetite.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals undertaking physical activity often consume foods immediately before exercise in&#xD;
      order to improve their performance. However, it is currently unknown whether this eating&#xD;
      practice influences the gut hormone response to exercise as well as how hungry an individual&#xD;
      feels post-exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the effect of consuming a sugary&#xD;
      (carbohydrate) drink immediately before starting an exercise session on the concentration of&#xD;
      these gut hormones as well as the amount of food eaten in the hours following exercise&#xD;
      completion.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is well established that following an acute bout of moderate-to-high intensity exercise&#xD;
      individuals experience a transient suppression of hunger and a delay in the commencement of&#xD;
      eating - a phenomenon referred to as exercise-induced anorexia. Acute exercise modulates the&#xD;
      concentrations of gut hormones known to influence satiety, including the anorexigenic&#xD;
      hormones glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and peptide tyrosine tyrosine (PYY), as well as the&#xD;
      acylated form of the orexigenic hormone ghrelin. These alterations in gut hormone&#xD;
      concentrations have consequently been hypothesised to play a key role in exercise-induced&#xD;
      anorexia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite suppressing hunger and delaying eating, acute exercise does not appear to alter&#xD;
      short-term energy intake in the immediate hours following exercise completion. The absence of&#xD;
      a compensatory response therefore creates an energy deficit capable of inducing weight loss.&#xD;
      Strategies that augment the gut hormone response to acute exercise may thus increase the&#xD;
      potency of exercise as a weight-loss tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research investigating the effect of exercise on appetite has frequently utilised&#xD;
      participants in a fasting state. Undertaking exercise in this physiological condition&#xD;
      contradicts current practices, as athletes often consume a carbohydrate source immediately&#xD;
      prior to exercise in an attempt to maximise performance. It is currently unknown as to&#xD;
      whether the consumption of carbohydrate during this period may further enhance the gut&#xD;
      hormone response to exercise, and thus research into a potential additive effect is&#xD;
      warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High-intensity exercise increases sympathetic nervous system activity and catecholamine&#xD;
      release. Catecholamine concentrations are negatively correlated with acylated ghrelin&#xD;
      concentrations and may directly stimulate GLP-1 and PYY release via activation of Î²-receptors&#xD;
      located on L-cells. The decrease in gastric emptying rate that is observed during&#xD;
      high-intensity exercise is also attributed to this increase in sympathetic activity.&#xD;
      Consequently, an increase in sympathetic nervous system activity has been postulated as a key&#xD;
      mechanism underlying exercise-induced changes in gut hormone concentrations. However, to our&#xD;
      knowledge, no study has directly measured the relationship between sympathetic nervous system&#xD;
      activity and anorexigenic gut hormone release during exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the aim of this study is to examine any potential additive effects of carbohydrate&#xD;
      ingestion immediately prior to exercise on gut hormone release and post-exercise appetite&#xD;
      suppression. Furthermore, this study will look to investigate the mechanisms underlying&#xD;
      changes in gut hormone concentrations experienced during exercise.&#xD;
