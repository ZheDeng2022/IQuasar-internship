  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Using an indicated prevention approach, investigators propose to enroll 150&#xD;
      spousally-bereaved adults aged 60 years and older in the first 6 months after spousal death&#xD;
      who are at high risk for major depression disorder because of subthreshold symptoms of&#xD;
      depression. A confirmatory efficacy trial will be conducted in which participants will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to (a) self-monitor sleep, meals, and physical activity for 12 weeks using&#xD;
      digital monitoring plus motivational health coaching (WELL; n=75); or (b) enhanced usual care&#xD;
      (EUC, usual care plus study assessments, n=75). Objective actigraphic measures of the 24-hour&#xD;
      pattern of day and nighttime activity - known as the rest-activity rhythm - will be measured&#xD;
      to evaluate circadian rhythms as a mediator of treatment outcomes. Participants will be&#xD;
      assessed at baseline, months 1 &amp; 2, post-intervention, and 3, 6,12, 18-months&#xD;
      post-intervention. In addition, the investigators will include a subset of participants&#xD;
      bereaved by COVID-19 (or suspected as bereaved by COVID-19). Participants in this subset will&#xD;
      undergo the same research procedures as the main cohort. Participants in both the main cohort&#xD;
      and subset determined to be fully eligible will be randomized into two groups with a total&#xD;
      of: usual care (EUC;n=125) and WELL (WELL; n=125).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this R01 application is to test the efficacy of a new behavioral&#xD;
      intervention that targets the timing and regularity of sleep, meals, and physical activity to&#xD;
      stabilize circadian rhythms, for reducing symptoms of depression during the spousal&#xD;
      bereavement period.&#xD;
