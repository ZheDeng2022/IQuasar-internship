      University Le Bonheur Pediatric Specialists (ULPS) and Le Bonheur Community Health and&#xD;
      Well-Being, Maternal Child Department, have started the Family Resilience Initiative (FRI) in&#xD;
      the ULPS General Pediatrics Clinic. This clinical program screens children 9 to 48 months of&#xD;
      age for Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) and Social Determinants of Health (SDH) at the&#xD;
      time of presentation for well child checks. Children with positive screens for ACES and/or&#xD;
      SDH, and their adult caregivers, receive community resource referrals with warm handoffs to&#xD;
      vetted organizations. In addition, if indicated, psychological services are offered for&#xD;
      children based upon the presence of one or more of ACEs and current health, social, and&#xD;
      behavioral problems. It is expected that enrollment in FRI will improve quality of life for&#xD;
      families through reduction in stress by addressing unmet social needs and providing&#xD;
      psychological counseling of children and families with any ACE exposure. The investigators&#xD;
      expect that FRI will have a positive impact on the physical health, healthcare utilization,&#xD;
      mental health, development, and school readiness of children in the program compared to&#xD;
      controls. The investigators will compare changes in weight for height and blood pressure&#xD;
      percentiles at enrollment and end of study and the number of unscheduled healthcare visit for&#xD;
      illness for children in the FRI clinical program compared to controls, receiving standard of&#xD;
      care. Healthcare visits include visits to the clinic and visits to the Le Bonheur Emergency&#xD;
      Department. The investigators will also compare pre- and post-treatment scores on the&#xD;
      validated Child Behavior Checklist and Parenting Stress Index as a measure of stress&#xD;
      reduction. Furthermore, the investigators will measure age appropriate attainment of&#xD;
      developmental milestones scores on early, school-based testing (MAP) testing scores obtained&#xD;
      through Seeding Success. The investigators will also determine rates of physician-diagnosed&#xD;
      early behavioral disorders such as ADHD. The investigators expect that reduced stress and its&#xD;
      downstream conditions will lead to decreased healthcare visits, improved attainment of&#xD;
      developmental and educational milestones, and lower rates of behavioral disorders.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), social determinants of health (SDH) and their&#xD;
      downstream health effects are the public health crisis of our time. Many chronic diseases are&#xD;
      known to originate with, or are exacerbated by, exposure to toxic stress in childhood&#xD;
      including learning and cognitive disabilities, asthma, obesity, diabetes, cancer, and&#xD;
      behavioral health disorders such as ADHD, depression and substance abuse. While poverty is&#xD;
      not considered an ACE, ACE exposure and unmet social needs are more common in those living in&#xD;
      lower income communities. Memphis, the poorest statistical metropolitan area in the country&#xD;
      with a population over one million people has an overall poverty rate of 26.9% and a child&#xD;
      poverty rate of 44.7%. A telephone survey of over 1500 Shelby County residents conducted in&#xD;
      the summer of 2014 found that 52% of adults reported at least one ACE and 12% reported four&#xD;
      or more. Race is also an important factor in health disparities. Although the effects of race&#xD;
      are predominantly due to associated income inequities, systemic racism can also have effects&#xD;
      on health. For example, disparities in birth outcomes between black and white mothers exists&#xD;
      across all socioeconomic strata but is most prominent among highly educated African American&#xD;
      women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The association between poverty and ill health is likely mediated through several pathways.&#xD;
      In impoverished households there may be limited cognitive stimulation and neglect. Poor&#xD;
      quality and location of housing may expose children to environmental toxins such as lead or&#xD;
      air pollution and allergens. Poor diet may result in micronutrient deprivation. In addition&#xD;
      to these known negative exposures, environmental stress through exposure to familial discord&#xD;
      and disruption, intrafamily violence, overcrowding of the home, and neighborhood violence&#xD;
      appears also to play a role in the poor mental and physical health of individuals with these&#xD;
      exposures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The link between toxic stress from ACES and other social determinants of health and adverse&#xD;
      physical and mental health outcomes is derived from mostly cross-sectional studies where&#xD;
      individuals with and without certain health conditions are compared for exposure to ACEs and&#xD;
      SDH. These studies have been critical in revealing the spectrum of childhood and adult&#xD;
      conditions that may be triggered or exacerbated by toxic stress. Both acute severe stress&#xD;
      stemming from exposures like child maltreatment and chronic lower grade stresses stemming&#xD;
      from exposure to poverty and its associated risks are associated with physical and mental&#xD;
      illness. Much of the research into the mechanisms underpinning these associations has&#xD;
      examined the epigenetic effect of these episodic or longer-term stressors. Epigenetics refers&#xD;
      to post-translational modifications of DNA such as methylation, the covalent binding of&#xD;
      methyl groups at CpG sites, oligodeoxynucleotides where cytosine is adjacent to guanine.&#xD;
      Changes in methylation patterns can result from de novo methylation of DNA or removal of&#xD;
      pre-existing methylation sites. Most epigenetic changes influence gene transcription through&#xD;
      methylation of promotor and repressor regions. A gene promotor containing methylated CpG&#xD;
      sequences is less able to bind transcription factors resulting in reduced gene transcription.&#xD;
      Many studies have found differential methylation of areas within genes as well as intergenic&#xD;
      areas of DNA. The effect these areas of methylation have on gene expression are unknown.&#xD;
      Histones, proteins around which DNA is coiled, can be modified as well through methylation&#xD;
      and acetylation. These modifications are thought to relax DNA coiling and open up gene&#xD;
      regulatory sites for interaction with transcription factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There have been studies examining differences in methylation across the genome, comparing the&#xD;
      number of sites with increased and reduced methylation and drawing inferences as to the&#xD;
      effect of these differences on phenotype. Many such studies have demonstrated clear&#xD;
      differences in methylation patterns between subjects with greater and lesser exposure to&#xD;
      episodic and lifetime stress. Differential methylation of specific genes and their promotor&#xD;
      regions have also been studied, specifically, genes that could be reasonably hypothesized to&#xD;
      play a role in the response to stress and the mitigating effects of different levels of&#xD;
      caregiving. These include the genes for the glucocorticoid receptor, serotonin and oxytocin.&#xD;
      The effects of chronically or acutely elevated cortisol levels on the methylation of the&#xD;
      glucocorticoid receptor gene and its promotor are, perhaps, the most extensively studied in&#xD;
      relation to ACEs and SDH. Animal studies have demonstrated an effect of high levels of&#xD;
      caregiving on levels of glucocorticoid receptor expression in key areas of the brain through&#xD;
      epigenetic changes which can improve self-regulation and mitigate the effects of toxic&#xD;
      stress. These epigenetic modifications have been demonstrated to be transmitted across&#xD;
      generations and may account for cross generational protection or vulnerability to the effects&#xD;
      of toxic stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most human data on the effects of epigenetics are derived from retrospective and&#xD;
      cross-sectional studies in which individuals with certain health conditions report on past or&#xD;
      current exposure to ACEs and/or SDH. Many of these studies examine the cumulative risk of&#xD;
      exposure over the lifetime of the study subject up to the point of the research. There does&#xD;
      appear to be a dose response relationship between earlier stressors and adolescent and adult&#xD;
      mental and physical health. Interventions applied early may, therefore, have the potential to&#xD;
      mitigate the effects of toxic stress on health even if exposures have already occurred and&#xD;
      prevent these important, long-term impacts on health and well-being. Mitigating factors&#xD;
      include high family functioning with lower levels of parental stress and greater parent-child&#xD;
      communication, as well as access to a medical home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary care is the cornerstone for screening, health promotion and disease prevention and&#xD;
      pediatricians are best situated to screen for and address ACEs and SDH. Studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated that many physicians do not perform any formal screening for ACEs but that&#xD;
      individuals and families, when approached in a family-centered manner, want their physicians&#xD;
      to screen for stressors and unmet social needs, even though it involves answering sensitive&#xD;
      questions.&#xD;
