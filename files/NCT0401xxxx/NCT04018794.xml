    <textblock>
      This study develops an initial prototype of a mobile tool that will support&#xD;
      clinician-directed behavioral/organizational skills treatment for adolescents with Attention&#xD;
      Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) with input guided from key stakeholders.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common childhood mental&#xD;
      health disorders, affecting 7-9% of children and adolescents, and leading to substantial&#xD;
      impairment in adolescence. Despite evidence suggesting that behavioral interventions are&#xD;
      efficacious, approximately 40-60% of adolescents receiving behavioral treatment show little&#xD;
      to no improvement and skills are rarely generalized beyond treatment sessions. Lack of&#xD;
      adolescent motivation and engagement, between-session skills use, reward saliency, and family&#xD;
      involvement are key contributors to these limited effects. Mobile digital health (dHealth)&#xD;
      strategies and gamification techniques, offer unique opportunities for overcoming the&#xD;
      barriers of treatments specific to ADHD by using interactive tools to reinforce in-vivo skill&#xD;
      practice, providing opportunities for immediate reinforcement, and motivating adolescents&#xD;
      with digital rewards. The primary goal of this study is to develop and preliminarily test the&#xD;
      integration of a digital health tool into organizational/behavioral skills treatment for&#xD;
      adolescents with ADHD by improving executive functioning skills, providing in-vivo skills&#xD;
      reinforcement, and monitoring adolescents' skill utilization. The proposed research will use&#xD;
      an iterative stakeholder-centered design to develop, refine, and preliminarily test a novel&#xD;
      digital health tool, applied as an adjunct to behavioral treatment for adolescents with ADHD&#xD;
      (ages 11-15). This includes focus groups with key stakeholders and an open preliminary&#xD;
      feasibility trial and usability testing. Data collected from focus groups will inform what&#xD;
      content and features could be developed to overcome challenges to adolescent engagement and&#xD;
      parent involvement. During the open trial (N=20) we will assess intervention feasibility,&#xD;
      usability, and acceptability. During and after the clinical trial, we will collect continuous&#xD;
      feedback from users on the usability and utility of the tool. At the end of this study we&#xD;
      will complete debugging and programming to maximize usability before a future larger clinical&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>System Usability Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>10-item technology-agnostic scale assessing technology product usability. The total SUS score ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating higher usability. SUS scores above 80 indicated good usability. The SUS has high internal consistency (α=.91) and high convergent validity with a separate rating of usability and user satisfaction (r=.8). The present study will assess system usability at post-treatment (month 3).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Post Stakeholder Feasibility and Usability Rating</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>8-item Stakeholder Feasibility and Usability Rating (SFUR) was used to assess stakeholders' perceptions of the overall feasibility and usability of the program. The SFUR score is a mean of all items and ranges from 1 to 5, with higher scores indicating higher feasibility and usability. This measure was developed for the present study. The present study will assess these feasibility ratings at post-treatment (month 3).</description>

    <time_frame>Change from Baseline (month 0) to Post-Intervention (3 months)</time_frame>
    <description>SCA-PI (Hoagwood et al., 2004) will assess medication and psychosocial treatment use and changes in use including any school (e.g., Daily Report Card) or community services during the study from baseline/pre-treatment (month 0) to post-intervention (3 months).</description>

    <description>A background form will collect information sufficient to calculate Hollingshead Socioeconomic Index as well as family income, marital status, and child's developmental and psychiatric history. Teachers and SMHPs will also complete a brief demographic form to assess age, race, and experience.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  1) Youth ages of 11-14 years (6-8th grade) that are attending a participating school&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  2) referred by SMHP as a youth with apparent ADHD-related problems,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  3) ≥6 symptoms (item score ≥2) of Inattention or Hyperactivity-Impulsivity on the&#xD;
             pooled parent and teacher Vanderbilt ADHD Rating Scale&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  4) ≥3 on the Impairment Rating Scale by parent and teacher (cross-situational&#xD;
             impairment)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  5) Parent consent and adolescent assent must be provided; b)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  1) No presence of conditions that are incompatible with this study's treatment&#xD;
             including: Parent or adolescent report of a prior diagnosis of either Autism Spectrum&#xD;
             Disorder, Bipolar Disorder, a Dissociative Disorder, Severe visual or hearing&#xD;
             impairment, severe language delay or intellectual impairment, or a Psychotic Disorder&#xD;
             will be excluded. Rationale: Individuals with these disorders often have very&#xD;
             dysregulated behavior and impairments that deviate from the focus of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  2) Adolescent is in all-day special education classes or if core classes not in&#xD;
             regular education classrooms. Rationale: The vast majority of adolescent with ADHD are&#xD;
             served in regular education classrooms and students in full-day self-contained&#xD;
             classrooms often have different challenges than students in regular education.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  3) Adolescent planning to change (start or stop) psychotropic medication. Note:&#xD;
             Adolescents taking medication will be required to meet all entry criteria, including&#xD;
             impairment criteria, thus indicating a need for the intervention. Adolescent taking&#xD;
             medication for attention or behavior are eligible as long as their medication regimens&#xD;
             are stable. Participating parents will also need to be able to read/speak English&#xD;
             because all measures are in English, and the intervention will be conducted in&#xD;
             English.&#xD;

        <description>10-item technology-agnostic scale assessing technology product usability. The total SUS score ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating higher usability. SUS scores above 80 indicated good usability. The SUS has high internal consistency (α=.91) and high convergent validity with a separate rating of usability and user satisfaction (r=.8). The present study will assess system usability at post-treatment (month 3).</description>

        <title>Post Stakeholder Feasibility and Usability Rating</title>
        <description>8-item Stakeholder Feasibility and Usability Rating (SFUR) was used to assess stakeholders' perceptions of the overall feasibility and usability of the program. The SFUR score is a mean of all items and ranges from 1 to 5, with higher scores indicating higher feasibility and usability. This measure was developed for the present study. The present study will assess these feasibility ratings at post-treatment (month 3).</description>
