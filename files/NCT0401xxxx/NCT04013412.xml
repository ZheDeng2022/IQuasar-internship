      A randomized, controlled trial to evaluate patient compliance and biologic mechanisms of a&#xD;
      short-term pre-operative Protein-Calorie Restriction (PCR) diet in comparison to a normal ad&#xD;
      libitum diet for 4 days before elective vascular surgery involving a major operation. This&#xD;
      study is a step in the long-term primary scientific objective to test the hypothesis that&#xD;
      brief up regulation of endogenous H2S via pre-operative PCR in elective major surgery&#xD;
      improves clinical outcomes in humans. After a successful pilot study of the PCR diet&#xD;
      conducted inpatient before carotid endarterectomy, the investigators now aim to expand the&#xD;
      study to at home diet among a variety of vascular surgery procedures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has emerged as a critical gaseous signaling molecule with a role in&#xD;
      multiple processes including ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury, angiogenesis, intimal&#xD;
      hyperplasia, and anti-inflammatory mechanisms. It even appears to hold anti-atherosclerotic&#xD;
      properties. However, the gas is toxic with a half-life of minutes, and it can be rapidly&#xD;
      oxidized. Furthermore, no clinically useful pharmacologic H2S donors have been developed to&#xD;
      date. In a 2015 Cell paper, the study investigators link substantial upregulation of&#xD;
      endogenous H2S to short-term manipulation of mammalian dietary intake: simple dietary&#xD;
      restriction. The current project serves as the second phase in the accelerated translation of&#xD;
      this important discovery toward clinical utility that may substantively impact the vascular&#xD;
      patient at several levels: protection from IR injury, intimal hyperplasia, peri-procedural&#xD;
      events such as stroke, cardiac dysfunction and myocardial infarction (MI), and promotion of&#xD;
      angiogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic protein and calorie dietary restriction (PCR; reduced food intake without&#xD;
      malnutrition) is known for extending longevity in multiple species. PCR is also an&#xD;
      established approach to positively impact metabolic fitness and resistance to multiple forms&#xD;
      of acute stress. Despite these wide-ranging benefits, potential clinical applications have&#xD;
      never been considered feasible in humans due to the practical difficulties associated with&#xD;
      voluntary food restriction combined with the assumption that PCR benefits take a long time to&#xD;
      accrue. Recent preclinical studies by the applicants reveal a rapid onset of PCR benefits&#xD;
      against surgically induced traumatic inflammation, IR injury, and the fibroproliferative&#xD;
      vascular response to injury in rodents. Mechanistically, rapid changes in adipose phenotype&#xD;
      and associated adipokine profiles appear to underlie these benefits; but the key mediator&#xD;
      appears to be endogenous H2S. This field thus stands poised to move to clinical utility, and&#xD;
      vascular surgery offers an optimal risk/benefit ratio for translation of the PCR/H2S&#xD;
      hypothesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the current project the investigators will complete a randomized, controlled trial to&#xD;
      evaluate patient compliance and biologic mechanisms of a short-term pre-operative PCR diet in&#xD;
      comparison to a normal ad libitum diet for 4 days before elective major vascular surgery.&#xD;
      Both Endpoints relate to the long-term primary scientific objective to test the hypothesis&#xD;
      that brief upregulation of endogenous H2S via pre-operative PCR in elective major surgery&#xD;
      improves clinical outcomes in humans. After a successful pilot study of the PCR diet&#xD;
      conducted inpatient before carotid endarterectomy titled Short-Term Endogenous Hydrogen&#xD;
      Sulfide Upregulation (NCT03303534), the investigators now aim to expand the study to at home&#xD;
      diet among a variety of vascular surgery procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eighty subjects undergoing carotid artery endarterectomy, aortic aneurysm repair (open, and&#xD;
      endovascular if groin cut down planned), open lower extremity arterial procedures (bypasses,&#xD;
      aneurysm repair, arterial and bypass graft reconstructions), major amputation of the lower&#xD;
      extremity (below knee and above knee amputations), or open hemodialysis access procedures for&#xD;
      either symptomatic or asymptomatic disease will be recruited and enrolled at Brigham and&#xD;
      Women's Hospital. Using a randomized (3:2), parallel design, patients will receive either the&#xD;
      PCR diet (n=48; ScandiShake [any of 4 flavors] mixed with almond milk, calculated&#xD;
      individually for a total daily volume to achieve 30% caloric restriction and 70% protein&#xD;
      restriction, based on body weight and activity level), or continued routine ad libitum diet&#xD;
      (n=32). Daily physical activity will be assessed by questionnaire to determine the activity&#xD;
      factor for accurate calorie restriction calculations. Water intake is ad libitum for both&#xD;
      cohorts, and both diets can be consumed throughout the day and night (except on the day of&#xD;
      surgery). Patients will consume their assigned diets for the four days leading up to surgery&#xD;
      until midnight the day of surgery when both cohorts will be fasted for the procedure (per&#xD;
      standard clinical guidelines).&#xD;
