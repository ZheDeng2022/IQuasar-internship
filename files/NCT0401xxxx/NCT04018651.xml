  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nationally, the HIV case rate among black/ African American (AA) women is nearly 20 times&#xD;
      higher than in white women; for Hispanic/Latino women it is 4.5 times higher. Moreover,&#xD;
      according to findings in the HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN) Study 064 (The Women's HIV&#xD;
      SeroIncidence Study), HIV incidence among women who live in communities with high HIV&#xD;
      prevalence and poverty is about 6 times higher than for black/AA women. South Florida's new&#xD;
      HIV diagnoses are now triple the national average due to rates in Miami-Dade and Broward&#xD;
      counties in its AA, Latino and Haitian communities. Black women follow black men who have sex&#xD;
      with men (MSM) as the most crisis-ridden of the communities in South Florida, the state as a&#xD;
      whole, the South, and the U.S. Women overall have been at a disadvantage in the HIV epidemic&#xD;
      due to gender differences and norms that shape biological, social and economic vulnerability.&#xD;
      Racial and ethnic disparities magnify the risk. Co-factors such as alcohol and other drug&#xD;
      (AOD) use intersect and reinforce other comorbidities. Living in a high prevalence area&#xD;
      significantly hardens the risk and makes it tougher to overcome. Options to help women stay&#xD;
      HIV negative have been limited, and the absence of practical female-controlled prevention&#xD;
      strategies and relative dependence on cooperative use of the male condom continue to keep&#xD;
      women's HIV vulnerability high. This obstacle shifted several years ago with FDA approval and&#xD;
      Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) endorsement of oral pre-exposure&#xD;
      prophylaxis (PrEP). However, women do not know about PrEP. Despite FDA approval in 2012,&#xD;
      followed by expansions in recommended use from the CDC and World Health Organization (WHO),&#xD;
      the majority of women in the U.S. are not aware of oral PrEP as an HIV prevention strategy&#xD;
      that applies to them. This study utilizes community-based participatory research (CBPR) to&#xD;
      develop an intervention program that will promote optimal PrEP utilization among women of&#xD;
      color in South Florida. The overall goal is to determine how best to target and improve PrEP&#xD;
      utilization among women of color with substantial risks for HIV, including alcohol use.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A singular limitation in the fight against HIV has been the absence of practical&#xD;
      female-controlled prevention strategies and relative dependence on cooperative use of the&#xD;
      male condom. Since 2012, medication for pre-exposure prophylaxis or PrEP has been&#xD;
      FDA-approved in the U.S., with guidance for its use extended to all individuals at&#xD;
      substantial risk in 2014 by the CDC and in 2015 by the WHO. In June 2016, the American&#xD;
      Medical Association (AMA) instituted policies in concurrence, and in July 2016 an updated&#xD;
      National HIV/AIDS Strategy was released making PrEP one of the four pillars in the nation's&#xD;
      effort against HIV. To date, the largest uptake and implementation has been among the MSM&#xD;
      population, which still bears the primary burden of the epidemic in the U.S. However, women&#xD;
      continue to face a highly disproportionate risk and significant barriers to progress due to&#xD;
      gender and structural disparities and biological susceptibility. Many of these barriers&#xD;
      revolve around disparities that limit agency, most pointedly in negotiation of safe sex. Yet,&#xD;
      existing studies indicate that very few of the women at substantial risk in the U.S. have&#xD;
      awareness of PrEP, either from community sources or their doctors. Moreover, a recent&#xD;
      national survey showed that PrEP awareness is suboptimal among a majority of providers.&#xD;
      Clearly, PrEP as a viable female-controlled method is a long way from being a key part of the&#xD;
      country's HIV strategy, and will require a community-driven approach to address demand and&#xD;
      supply, uptake and accessibility, to shift the terms of women's agency in HIV prevention.&#xD;
      This need is greatest among women of color, particularly when the use of alcohol and other&#xD;
      drugs (AOD) severely compounds their risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This U34 utilizes community-based participatory research (CBPR) to build upon a Pre-Meeting&#xD;
      of Community Stakeholders from the greater Miami and Fort Lauderdale areas, to develop an&#xD;
      intervention program that will promote optimal PrEP utilization among women of color in South&#xD;
      Florida who engage in risky sex and alcohol use. What is most potent in a CBPR-based study,&#xD;
      is community participation in defining problems and intervention components, identifying&#xD;
      applicable theories and evidence-based interventions (EBIs), and interpreting data and&#xD;
      outcomes. The research team is currently conducting an exploratory pilot test in Miami-Dade&#xD;
      County in South Florida, which leads the state in new HIV infections, and has a large&#xD;
      multiethnic distribution of Black and Latino women in its population. Florida currently ranks&#xD;
      1st in HIV diagnoses among all states in the U.S. The overall goal is to determine how best&#xD;
      to target and improve PrEP utilization among women of color with substantial risks for HIV,&#xD;
      including alcohol use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator's Specific Aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Identify perceived needs, priorities, barriers, and community strengths in the&#xD;
      implementation of HIV prevention programs, with the development of a PrEP continuum care&#xD;
      model, by conducting a summit to engage a diverse range of HIV- and HIV+ women of color,&#xD;
      health care providers and community stakeholders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Produce a replicable implementation program, including manuals, materials, screening&#xD;
      and assessment instruments, and procedures, through the formation of a Community Advisory and&#xD;
      Advocacy Board (CAAB) from summit participants, who will participate in a 2-day orientation&#xD;
      training workshop and form working groups with research team members to formulate study&#xD;
      methods and the intervention model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Conduct an exploratory pilot of the PrEP model, implemented by the CAAB, in Broward&#xD;
      and Miami-Dade for fidelity, feasibility, and acceptability, among 120 multi-ethnic women of&#xD;
      color in South Florida (primarily African American (AA), Latina, Haitian). PrEP uptake and&#xD;
      adherence and retention in care will be measured over a 6 month period. Results will inform a&#xD;
      future U01, including the design of target and comparison groups.&#xD;

    <description>The PrEP Master Adherence Intervention consists of 4 face to face individual education sessions and a series of telephone contacts to identify barriers and facilitators to optimal PrEP adherence over a six-month period. Each PrEP Master education session includes a review of an individualized plan to reduce risk, review of information about PrEP, and different discussion points. Key messages include:&#xD;
Importance of daily adherence;&#xD;
Three week delay for full effectiveness describing PrEP like taking the birth control pill;&#xD;
Condom use for other sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevention;&#xD;
Pregnancy prevention plans;&#xD;
Plans for follow up calls&#xD;
Referral to other treatment services if necessary</description>
