      Spider phobia is an exceedingly common phobia throughout the world. The current standard&#xD;
      treatment involves exposure therapy, which consists of a series of brief exposures of an&#xD;
      individual to the thing they fear, in this case spiders. This study aims to examine the use&#xD;
      of a neuromodulatory technology, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), as a possible&#xD;
      treatment option for spider phobia. TMS uses low-intensity electromagnetic energy to&#xD;
      stimulate the brain, introducing energy into critical hubs of brain networks to &quot;reset&quot; their&#xD;
      function and alleviate symptoms with very few side-effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will consist of four separate visits. After screening subjects for spider phobia,&#xD;
      baseline testing of subjective distress measures and physiologic stress data (heart rate&#xD;
      variability and sweat response) during a prolonged spider exposure test will be collected.&#xD;
      Subjects will then be placed into one of two groups: one receiving exposure therapy and&#xD;
      intermittent Theta Burst Stimulation (iTBS) TMS (active study group), and another receiving&#xD;
      exposure therapy with iTBS to a circuit not involved in a phobic reaction (control study&#xD;
      group). Subjects will undergo their first treatment session during the first visit following&#xD;
      the baseline data collection; the second and third treatments will occur the following two&#xD;
      days. The fourth visit will occur one week after the third and consist of the same testing as&#xD;
      the first visit; the same data will be collected. Changes from pre- to post-treatment in both&#xD;
      subjective and physiologic data will be compared between the treatment and sham groups to&#xD;
      examine effects of TMS on spider phobia.&#xD;

      OVERVIEW The experiment will consist of four days. Day 1 will include informed consent,&#xD;
      questionnaires, a behavioral approach test with a spider, a series of short exposures with a&#xD;
      spider, and the first TMS treatment (for a total of approximately 75-90 minutes). Day 2 will&#xD;
      occur one to two days after Day 1 and will consist of a second series of short exposures with&#xD;
      a spider and the second TMS treatment (30 minutes). Day 3 will occur one to two days after&#xD;
      Day 2 and will also consist of a series of short exposures and a TMS treatment (30 minutes).&#xD;
      Day 4 will occur five to seven days after Day 3 and will consist of post-study questionnaires&#xD;
      and an identical behavioral approach test as is conducted on the first visit (30 minutes).&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to either an active TMS treatment group (using an iTBS&#xD;
      stimulation protocol over the participant's ventro-medial prefrontal cortex, an area involved&#xD;
      in phobic response) or a control TMS treatment group (using the same iTBS stimulation&#xD;
      protocol over the central sulcus and between hemispheres, a site not associated with memory&#xD;
      or fear response).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective participants will be recruited from two groups: 1) undergraduate students&#xD;
      recruited through the UCLA Psychology Department Subject Pool (i.e., SONA) and 2) general&#xD;
      population over the age of 18 recruited via flyers. All prospective participants will be&#xD;
      screened with the 31-question Spider Phobia Questionnaire (SPQ) to ensure eligibility for&#xD;
      participation, with a minimum total score equal to or greater than 17 required for&#xD;
      participation.(Klorman, Weerts, Hastings, Melamed, &amp; Lang, 1974) Participants will be&#xD;
      enrolled for the study only if they are able to complete all four visits of the experiment.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Participants will be assigned course credit or receive financial compensation after&#xD;
      participating in the study. Those who participate through SONA recruitment will receive&#xD;
      course credit. Participants will sign up for the study only if they are able to make all four&#xD;
      visits of the experiment. If a participant does not attend all three visits, course credit&#xD;
      will still be given for the amount of time the participant spent doing the experiment (i.e.,&#xD;
      1 credit for 1 hour).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After screening, participants will be emailed blank copies of the forms, questionnaires, and&#xD;
      screening tools that will be completed during the first visit, and they will be informed that&#xD;
      they may complete the forms in advance and bring the completed forms with them to save time,&#xD;
      should they desire. They will be asked to not return their forms via email, and to only bring&#xD;
      them to the first visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DAY 1 On Day 1, participants will first provide informed consent after the nature of the&#xD;
      study has been fully explained and the participant has had time to ask questions. After&#xD;
      obtaining informed consent, participants will complete a demographics and eligibility&#xD;
      questionnaire (see Section 10.1, Item 1.0) or hand in their already-completed forms, which&#xD;
      will be reviewed by the researcher upon completion. Ineligible participants (i.e.,&#xD;
      participants with bee, insect, or spider allergies, with scores below 17 on the SPQ, who do&#xD;
      not speak English, are taking medications that lower the seizure threshold, or other&#xD;
      exclusion criteria as listed in section 11.1) will be informed that they do not meet criteria&#xD;
      and the research session will be terminated at this time. Participants found to be ineligible&#xD;
      will still receive 1 credit for their time. All to-be-administered questionnaires are listed&#xD;
      below and uploaded in Section 10.1, Item 1.0 of this IRB submission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spider Phobia Questionnaire (SPQ; Klorman et al, 1974) Demographics &amp; Eligibility&#xD;
      Questionnaire Fear of Spiders Questionnaire (FSQ; Szymanski &amp; O'Donohue, 1995) PHQ2 PHQ9&#xD;
      Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (specifically the suicidality item) GAD7 Tracking and&#xD;
      Reimbursement (this questionnaire is used exclusively to track the number of visits completed&#xD;
      and information necessary to ensuring that participants receive the proper financial or&#xD;
      course credit compensation for their time; it contains no research data used for the study)&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will complete a BAT with a live tarantula. This phase of the experiment&#xD;
      consists of 9 steps, lasting 30 seconds each with a 30 second pause between each step. During&#xD;
      the BAT, self-reported and physiological data will be collected at each step. Skin&#xD;
      conductance response (SCR) and heart-rate variability (HRV) will be utilized as physiologic&#xD;
      measures of fearful arousal using BIOPAC MP150 hardware and AcqKnowledge version 4.2 software&#xD;
      (BIOPAC Systems, Inc.).(Appelhans &amp; Luecken, 2006; Choi et al., 2017; Christopoulos, Uy, &amp;&#xD;
      Yap, 2016; Laine, Spitler, Mosher, &amp; Gothard, 2009; Thayer, Åhs, Fredrikson, Sollers, &amp;&#xD;
      Wager, 2012; Williams et al., 2001) Baseline SCR and HRV will be measured during a 3-minute&#xD;
      prior to initiation of a BAT. SCR will be recorded from electrodes attached to the subjects'&#xD;
      second and third fingers. Average SCRs and peak SCRs at each step will be measured and&#xD;
      compared to individual baselines. HRV will be calculated from R-R intervals in a lead II&#xD;
      electrode configuration recording; average HRVs from each step will be compared to individual&#xD;
      baselines. The steps are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Stand 5 feet away from tarantula in closed terrarium&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Stand 1 foot away from tarantula in terrarium with top removed&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Place both hands on the side of terrarium with top removed&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Touch nose against the glass of terrarium while looking at the tarantula&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Place gloved hand halfway inside terrarium&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Place gloved hand inside terrarium with all fingertips touching base of terrarium&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Place bare hand inside terrarium with all fingertips touching base of terrarium&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Touch the back of the tarantula's leg continuously with a Q-tip&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Touch the back of the tarantula's leg continuously with the tip of the index finger&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to beginning the BAT, all participants will be read instructions reporting the&#xD;
      following: The experiment consists of 9 steps, each lasting 30 seconds. Instructions for each&#xD;
      step will be read aloud before the participant proceed to the next step. Each step must be&#xD;
      completed before moving on to the next step, and steps much be completed in sequential order.&#xD;
      During each step, participant's heart rate and sweating will be recorded via the electrodes&#xD;
      on participant's chest and finger. After the experimenter reads the instructions for the next&#xD;
      step and prior to completing the step, the participant will also be asked to rate&#xD;
      participant's confidence level to complete the step on a scale from 0 to 100 (0= no&#xD;
      confidence, 25= mild confidence, 50= moderate confidence, 75= high confidence, 100 = complete&#xD;
      confidence) and participant's anticipatory distress on a scale from 0 to 100 (0=no distress,&#xD;
      25=mild distress, 50=moderate distress, 75= high distress, 100= severe distress). After&#xD;
      completion of each step, participants will be asked to rate their maximum level of distress&#xD;
      during the step on a scale from 0 to 100. Participants are entitled to withdraw at any step&#xD;
      if they do not wish to continue. At this point participants will have an opportunity to ask&#xD;
      questions before beginning testing. The first step of the experiment is to stand 5 feet away&#xD;
      from the tarantula while it is in its closed container for 30 seconds. The final step of the&#xD;
      experiment is to touch the back of the tarantula's leg with the tip of participant's index&#xD;
      finger continuously for 30 seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before beginning the BAT and after ensuring comprehension of the above instructions, the&#xD;
      experimenter will ask the participant to rate his/her overall confidence and overall&#xD;
      anticipatory distress with respect to his/her ability to complete all nine steps (see rating&#xD;
      scales in above instructions). Before each subsequent step, the participant will be asked to&#xD;
      rate his/her confidence and anticipatory distress regarding his/her ability to complete that&#xD;
      particular step. During each step, the experimenter will record the spider's movement on a&#xD;
      categorical scale (0 = no movement, 1 = a little movement, 2 = a lot of movement). After each&#xD;
      step, the participant will be asked to rate his/her maximum level of distress while&#xD;
      completing that particular step. Finally, the experimenter will record the number of steps&#xD;
      willingly completed for a given participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Next, all participants will engage in a series of exposure practices with a different live&#xD;
      tarantula from the one they saw during the BAT. Exposure therapy will consist of a series of&#xD;
      10 identical exposure trials of a 30-second duration with a 30-second pause between trials.&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to place an ungloved hand in the terrarium (with all fingertips&#xD;
      touching the base of the terrarium) on the opposite end of the terrarium as the tarantula&#xD;
      during the trial. Prior to completing the series of exposures, participants will be asked&#xD;
      about their feared outcome concerning approaching the tarantula (e.g., being bitten).&#xD;
      Participants are entitled to withdraw at any step during exposures and will not be prevented&#xD;
      from further continuation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the series of exposures, participants will undergo TMS treatments using an iTBS&#xD;
      protocol. Before the first iTBS treatment, the TMS coil will be calibrated to the subject's&#xD;
      individual resting motor threshold (RMT), or the minimum stimulus intensity necessary to&#xD;
      elicit a motor response in the right abductor pollicis brevis (APB) or first dorsal&#xD;
      interosseus (FDI) muscles for ≥ 50% of stimuli applied to the motor cortex. After initial&#xD;
      calibration, the TMS coil will be placed over the subject's ventral medial prefrontal cortex&#xD;
      (vmPFC; as determined using position Fpz of the international 10-20 EEG electrode system), a&#xD;
      TMS target shown to affect phobic response.(Baeken et al., 2010; Guhn et al., 2012, 2014;&#xD;
      Suarez-Jimenez et al., 2018) Stimulation intensity of 100% of the individual RMT in bursts of&#xD;
      three pulses at a frequency of 50 Hz every 200 ms on top of a 5Hz carrier wave. Pulse&#xD;
      delivery is over 2 s and repeated every 10 s, 20 times in succession, for a total of 600&#xD;
      pulses delivered in 3.33 minutes.(Baeken et al., 2010; Bulteau et al., 2017; Guhn et al.,&#xD;
      2014) This specific protocol was selected based on the assumption that it should impact fear&#xD;
      circuitry top-down from prefrontal to subcortical networks (particularly the amygdala) as&#xD;
      seen in prior work.(Baeken et al., 2010; Bulteau et al., 2017; Guhn et al., 2014) Control&#xD;
      iTBS will consist of the same stimulation parameters over the subject's midline central&#xD;
      sulcus or vertex (as determined using position Cz, of the international 10-20 EEG electrode&#xD;
      system). This placement was chosen for control as its position over the vertex will minimize&#xD;
      amount of cortex stimulated and the stimulated area is not associated with the circuitry&#xD;
      examined in this experiment.(Duecker &amp; Sack, 2015) It is a commonly-used control site in TMS&#xD;
      studies because it is associated with no known effects and has a similar risk profile to&#xD;
      other TMS sites. (Foltys et al., 2001; Jung, Bungert, Bowtell, &amp; Jackson, 2016; Rossi et al.,&#xD;
      2009; Weiss, Sparing, Fink, Tomasino, &amp; Dafotakis, 2008) It is generally associated with&#xD;
      lower rates of scalp discomfort and no clinically-observed behavioral or mood effects.(Jung&#xD;
      et al., 2016; Rossi et al., 2009) Some work has demonstrated a possible decrease in&#xD;
      activation of the default mode network, though this has not been found to be&#xD;
      clinically-significant.(Jung et al., 2016)&#xD;
&#xD;
      DAY 2 As described above, this visit will occur one to two days after Day 1. All participants&#xD;
      will return to the laboratory to engage in a second series of exposure practices with the&#xD;
      same tarantula from exposures at the first visit. They will undergo 10 identical exposure&#xD;
      trials for durations of 30 seconds each, with a 30-second pause between trials. During each&#xD;
      exposure trial, they will again be asked to place an ungloved hand in the terrarium (with all&#xD;
      fingertips touching the base of the terrarium) on the opposite end of the terrarium as the&#xD;
      tarantula during the trial. Prior to completing the series of exposures, participants will be&#xD;
      asked about their feared outcome concerning approaching the tarantula (e.g., being bitten).&#xD;
      Participants are entitled to withdraw at any step during exposures and will not be prevented&#xD;
      from further continuation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the series of exposure practices, participants will undergo a TMS treatment using&#xD;
      an iTBS treatment protocol in the same location that they received stimulation on Day 1&#xD;
      (vmPFC vs. vertex).&#xD;
&#xD;
      DAY 3 This visit will be identical to Day 2, and will occur one to two days after Day 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DAY 4 This visit will occur five to seven days after Day 3. All participants will complete&#xD;
      the Spider Phobia Questionnaire (SPQ; Klorman et al, 1974) and Fear of Spiders Questionnaire&#xD;
      (FSQ; Szymanski &amp; O'Donohue, 1995), uploaded in Section 10.1, Item 1.0, to test for change in&#xD;
      arachnophobia fear/avoidance symptoms as a function of TMS treatment received. Next, all&#xD;
      participants will complete an identical BAT to that completed at their first visit with the&#xD;
      same tarantula (see DAY 1 above). Self-report and physiological (i.e., SCR) data will again&#xD;
      be collected. After completion of these forms, participants will be debriefed by an&#xD;
      un-blinded member of the study team and informed to which group they are assigned. They will&#xD;
      be encouraged to discuss whatever questions or concerns they have regarding the study at that&#xD;
      time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of Day 4, participants will be compensated for their time with one credit&#xD;
      per hour of study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dependent variables (DVs) will be quantitative self-reports and behavioral symptoms of fear&#xD;
      and avoidance of spiders both pre- and post-treatment, including SCR (difference between&#xD;
      baseline and average level during BAT anticipation period, and number of peaks during BAT),&#xD;
      total number of steps completed during the BAT, self-reported distress, anticipatory&#xD;
      distress, and maximum distress per BAT step, and total score on the SPQ. BAT measures will be&#xD;
      collected for each step and therefore minima, maxima, and means will be compared between the&#xD;
      two groups. Primary outcomes examined will be number of steps completed during BAT,&#xD;
      self-reported distress during BAT, number of SCR peaks during BAT, SPQ score, and FOS score.&#xD;
      All other variables examined will be secondary outcomes. Additionally, for feasibility and&#xD;
      tolerability assessment, attendance to TMS treatment sessions and early termination of TMS&#xD;
      treatment sessions will be recorded. The primary independent variable examined will be the&#xD;
      treatment group (iTBS vs. control iTBS). The sample size will be 40 participants (20 per&#xD;
      group). Pre-comparison ANOVA will be performed to limit type 1 error due to multiplicity of&#xD;
      comparisons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses will be tested using between-group two-tailed t-tests given that investigators are&#xD;
      testing not only for magnitude of an effect, but also direction of an effect. Investigators&#xD;
      expect that comparisons of efficacy will demonstrate increased confidence during BAT&#xD;
      approach, decreased endorsed fear of spiders as measured by SPQ and FSQ, and reduced&#xD;
      physiologic response to stimulus (reduced HRV and SCR) with active iTBS and exposure when&#xD;
      compared to control iTBS and exposure. Investigators expect that comparisons of feasibility&#xD;
      and tolerability will show no significant difference between attendance to, early termination&#xD;
      of, or subjective tolerability ratings of TMS treatment sessions between treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADVERSE EVENT MANAGEMENT Study personnel administering the BAT and exposure treatments will&#xD;
      be bachelors-level trained or current UCLA students. These personnel have not been identified&#xD;
      at this time, but will be added to the IRB and protocols as they are identified. They will be&#xD;
      trained by personnel from Anxiety and Depression Research Center (ADRC; personnel under the&#xD;
      supervision of Dr. Michelle Craske) in both how to properly administer the BAT and exposure&#xD;
      treatments, as well as how to address any questions, concerns, or unexpected events that&#xD;
      arise from these treatments (including acute episodes of psychological distress, escape of&#xD;
      spiders, etc.). These personnel have ample experience in training others how to administer&#xD;
      these treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three Chilean Rose Tarantulas (Grammostola rosea) will be stored in individual terrariums&#xD;
      with weighted lids in a locked room within the ADRC (Life Sciences 5347), under the&#xD;
      supervision of Dr. Michelle Craske and her laboratory personnel. All BATs and exposure&#xD;
      treatments will take place in a controlled closed room without windows, open vents, or other&#xD;
      large openings, to minimize the likelihood of a tarantula escape. At the beginning and end of&#xD;
      every study session, study personnel will confirm the presence of the tarantula within the&#xD;
      terrarium and confirm complete closure of the terrarium. After termination of testing for the&#xD;
      day, study personnel will again confirm of the presence of the spider and the terrarium&#xD;
      closure before departing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event that a spider should escape from its terrarium, the participant will be removed&#xD;
      from the room and study personnel will immediately re-close the room, search for the&#xD;
      tarantula, and transfer it back to the terrarium in a manner safe for both the personnel and&#xD;
      the spider when found. This will involve coaxing the spider to a sealable pre-dampened&#xD;
      carrier, temporarily sealing it, and opening it inside the spider's terrarium. Though the&#xD;
      risk posed by a tarantula bite or hair projection is low and the risk of occurrence is low,&#xD;
      study personnel will don gloves, eye protection, and a long-sleeved labcoat (all three of&#xD;
      which will be provided) before attempting transfer to minimize this risk. If not found after&#xD;
      a thorough search, the room will remain closed, and other laboratory personnel and the PI&#xD;
      will be notified, and further action will be taken to locate the spider.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any injury sustained in the process of a spider escape or containment, such as a spider bite,&#xD;
      will be reported as an adverse event. Should such an event emerge, study personnel present at&#xD;
      the time of the event will be asked to contact the PI or a study clinician, who will assess&#xD;
      the severity of the event. If the PI is not contacted in real-time, personnel will contact&#xD;
      the PI within 24 hours of the event, and the PI will then report the adverse event within 24&#xD;
      hours of being informed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will employ the following strategy to manage suicidality and other serious&#xD;
      adverse events (SAEs). All exposure and TMS procedures will be performed during normal&#xD;
      working hours while there is a psychiatrist on duty at the Clinical TMS Service. Should&#xD;
      participants become acutely distressed during a study visit, the attending psychiatrist on&#xD;
      duty will take any steps necessary to address any clinical issues that emerge. The PI will&#xD;
      follow up with all participants by phone 12-24 hours after all exposure treatments to ensure&#xD;
      that they are not suffering from ongoing distress, and participants will be given contact&#xD;
      information for the PI to reach out sooner should they desire. The PI will involve licensed&#xD;
      clinicians as appropriate. At the initial study visit, subjects will complete the PHQ2&#xD;
      (reflex to PHQ9), GAD7, and HamD suicidality item and review their responses with a research&#xD;
      assistant and clinician. All subjects also will be reminded at each visit about the&#xD;
      availability of a clinician should the subject develop any event of concern, including&#xD;
      suicidality or adverse events. Should such an event emerge, the subject will be instructed to&#xD;
      contact the PI or a study clinician, who will assess the presentation as per their standard&#xD;
      clinical protocol. This assessment will categorize the SAE as emergent or nonemergent. For&#xD;
      non-emergent events, the clinicians will manage as they see fit. Rapid consultation with the&#xD;
      Principal Investigator is available; should the clinician contact the PI, he or she will then&#xD;
      be responsible for reporting the event as an SAE. If a consultation with the PI is not&#xD;
      pursued in real-time, the clinician will inform the PI of the event within 24 hours of having&#xD;
      identified the event. For emergent events, such as the worsening of suicidality or&#xD;
      self-injurious behavior, the clinician will instruct the subject to go to the nearest&#xD;
      emergency room possible. Should the clinician be concerned about the subject's imminent&#xD;
      safety, he or she may contact the individual named by the subject in the consent form as the&#xD;
      emergency contact, so that the contact person may help the subject get to an emergency room.&#xD;
      If such an action is not feasible, the clinician may petition the subject to be brought&#xD;
      involuntarily to the nearest emergency room possible, as provided for under state mental&#xD;
      health laws in California where the study is being conducted. Consultation at any time is&#xD;
      available by contacting the PI or a study clinician. Should the PI be contacted in real-time,&#xD;
      he will then be responsible for initiating the SAE reporting. If the PI is not contacted in&#xD;
      real-time, the clinician will contact the PI within 24 hours of the event, and the PI will&#xD;
      then complete SAE reporting within 24 hours of being informed. All reports of adverse events&#xD;
      will be reviewed by the PI and reported to the UCLA Institutional Review Board in accordance&#xD;
      with its policies.&#xD;

      <time_frame>Adverse event data were reported over the duration of each subject's participation in the study (i.e. from enrollment to 1 week after the completion of the third TMS treatment).</time_frame>
      <desc>No difference in definitions. TMS is a low-risk intervention, with the most serious adverse event generally being a seizure (occurring at a rate of approximately 1 in 30,000 in the general population). This study is a low/minimal risk study. Transient stimulation site discomfort was noted in both groups and rated immediately following TMS treatment as seen in outcomes data utilizing the McGill pain questionnaire.</desc>
