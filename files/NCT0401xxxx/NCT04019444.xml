  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, observer-blinded, dosage-escalation trial to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of ChAd155-RG compared with RABAVERT in&#xD;
      rabies virus-naïve healthy male and non-pregnant female adult subjects ages 18-49. There are&#xD;
      4 dose groups: Group A will receive ChAd155-RG at the lower dosage (5x1010vp) on Day 1, then&#xD;
      placebo injections on Days 8, 15, and 22; Group B will receive ChAd155-RG at the higher&#xD;
      dosage (1x1011vp) on Day 1, then placebo injections on Days 8, 15, and 22; Group C will&#xD;
      receive ChAd155-RG at the higher dosage (1x1011vp) on Days 1 and 15, and placebo injections&#xD;
      on Days 8 and 22; Group D will receive RABAVERT at the standard dose (1 mL) on Days 1, 8, and&#xD;
      22, and a placebo injection on Day 15. Since this is a dosage-escalation study, sentinel&#xD;
      subjects will be used at each dosage level before non-sentinel subjects will be enrolled. The&#xD;
      study will be conducted at Emory University Vaccine and Treatment Evaluation Unit (VTEU).&#xD;
      This trial is expected to take approximately 48 months to complete. The duration of each&#xD;
      subject's participation is approximately 13 months, from recruitment through the last study&#xD;
      visit. The primary objectives of this study are: 1) Assessment of the safety, tolerability,&#xD;
      and reactogenicity of one dose of ChAd155-RG at 5x1010vp per dose, or one or two doses of&#xD;
      ChAd155-RG at 1x1011vp per dose; 2) Comparison of the safety, tolerability, and&#xD;
      reactogenicity of one or two doses of ChAd155-RG, with three doses of RABAVERT.&#xD;

      This is a single-center, observer-blinded, Phase 1, dosage-escalation trial to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of ChAd155-RG compared with RABAVERT&#xD;
      in rabies virus-naïve healthy male and non-pregnant female adult subjects ages 18-49.&#xD;
      Subjects who have never received a licensed or investigational rabies virus vaccine, or an&#xD;
      Ad-based investigational vaccine, and who have never been exposed to a rabid animal will be&#xD;
      eligible for enrollment. There are 4 dose groups: Group A will receive ChAd155-RG at the&#xD;
      lower dosage (5x1010vp) on Day 1, then placebo injections on Days 8, 15, and 22; Group B will&#xD;
      receive ChAd155-RG at the higher dosage (1x1011vp) on Day 1, then placebo injections on Days&#xD;
      8, 15, and 22; Group C will receive ChAd155-RG at the higher dosage (1x1011vp) on Days 1 and&#xD;
      15, and placebo injections on Days 8 and 22; Group D will receive RABAVERT at the standard&#xD;
      dose (1 mL) on Days 1, 8, and 22, and a placebo injection on Day 15. Since this is a&#xD;
      dosage-escalation study, sentinel subjects will be used at each dosage level before&#xD;
      non-sentinel subjects will be enrolled. The SMC will review the available safety,&#xD;
      reactogenicity, AE, and lab data of all the sentinel subjects, and will decide if the&#xD;
      remaining non-sentinel subjects should be enrolled. The study will be conducted at Emory&#xD;
      University Vaccine and Treatment Evaluation Unit (VTEU). This trial is expected to take&#xD;
      approximately 48 months to complete. The duration of each subject's participation is&#xD;
      approximately 13 months, from recruitment through the last study visit. The primary&#xD;
      objectives of this study are: 1) Assessment of the safety, tolerability, and reactogenicity&#xD;
      of one dose of ChAd155-RG at 5x1010vp per dose, or one or two doses of ChAd155-RG at 1x1011vp&#xD;
      per dose; 2) Comparison of the safety, tolerability, and reactogenicity of one or two doses&#xD;
      of ChAd155-RG, with three doses of RABAVERT. The secondary objective is to assess the serum&#xD;
      rabies VNA levels by a standard, WHO-approved, RFFIT, as assessed by immune response kinetics&#xD;
      (through approximately 12 months after first dose of vaccine), seroconversion rates, and peak&#xD;
      GMT in each treatment arm.&#xD;

    <description>The ChAd155-RG Vaccine consists of a replication-defective group C ChAd, ChAd155, expressing RG under the control of the CMV promoter. The RG sequence cloned into the ChAd155 vector is a medoid, a natural viral strain with the highest average percent of amino acid identity among all RG sequences annotated in the NCBI database. The selected RG (NCBI strain AGN94271) shares an average 94% percent identity to the RGs in current vaccines.</description>
