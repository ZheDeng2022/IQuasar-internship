    <textblock>
      People tend to detect and recognise self-related information more quickly and efficiently&#xD;
      than other kinds of information. For example, in a cocktail party, people are usually able to&#xD;
      attend to just one conversation at a time. Messages from unattended conversations are rarely&#xD;
      registered. However, most people would still hear their own name mentioned in unattended&#xD;
      conversations. Research has shown that this self-referencing advantage manifests an&#xD;
      individual's normal cognitive function and emotional wellbeing. It may be influenced by self&#xD;
      worth and strength of self-esteem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes in self-related processing are hypothesised in various psychiatric conditions such as&#xD;
      dissociative identity disorder and affective disorders, but the connection is poorly&#xD;
      understood. Existing research mainly relies on self-report measures, which can be subjective&#xD;
      and time consuming. This project will initiate a new approach that the investigators have&#xD;
      developed to objectively measure self-related processing. The aim is to investigate how&#xD;
      patients suffering from common psychiatric disorders respond to self-related information&#xD;
      relative to age-matched control participants. The investigators also hope to establish&#xD;
      whether the objective measurement of the self can form a new pathway to improve early&#xD;
      diagnosis of mental health issues.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Objectives. The principal objective of this project is to find out whether common mental&#xD;
      health problems result in altered self-referencing bias/advantage. The investigators will use&#xD;
      a simple computer test to measure the strength of the self-referencing bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will also explore whether common mental health problems could be partially&#xD;
      indexed by deviations from the commonly observed self-referencing bias. If a deviation from&#xD;
      the bias can form a reliable index, the investigators will also look at how the measure helps&#xD;
      to harness other existing diagnostic methods for mental health issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scientific justification. People with various psychiatric disorders may have distorted and&#xD;
      often negative views about themselves. For example, patients suffering from dissociative&#xD;
      identity disorder are often unable to recognise their own identity. They may feel like a&#xD;
      stranger to themselves. People diagnosed with depression or social anxiety may possess&#xD;
      negative feelings about themselves. Even in a healthy sample, a negative mood or self-concept&#xD;
      could be result in a reduced sensitivity to self-related information. However, little is&#xD;
      known about the link between common mental health issues and self-concept. A recent study has&#xD;
      provided the first empirical evidence about the link through a study of dissociative identity&#xD;
      disorder. It was found that patients with this disorder are not more sensitive to the photo&#xD;
      of self-face compared to a stranger's face. This deviates from the typical self-referencing&#xD;
      advantage, because normal observers display greater sensitivity to self-related information&#xD;
      such as self-face and self-name relative to information related to a stranger or friend.&#xD;
      Affective disorders have also been linked to disturbances in self-definition. The study is&#xD;
      interesting because it showed for the first time that a simple self-referential test could&#xD;
      identify a deviation from the self-referencing bias in people with a psychiatric disorder,&#xD;
      this could be used to index the dysfunction and recovery of this condition. It is an&#xD;
      important finding in the field, because the link between the self-referencing bias and&#xD;
      psychiatric disorders has been largely relying on more complicated interviewing techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, as the authors of the study themselves acknowledge, a deviation from the common&#xD;
      pattern of self-referencing bias may not be specific to dissociative identity disorder. Other&#xD;
      psychiatric disorders may also result in an anomalous deviation from the typical&#xD;
      self-referencing bias. The main objective of the present study is to identify the generality&#xD;
      of the Lebois et al finding in other types of psychiatric disorders. Our hypothesis is that&#xD;
      atypical self-concept is not specific to dissociative identity disorder, but underlying all&#xD;
      common psychiatric disorders in general. Another important objective is to improve over their&#xD;
      method, which has several crucial limitations that prevent an unequivocal interpretation.&#xD;
      First, because their procedure presented a self-face or unfamiliar face for only 17&#xD;
      milliseconds, it demanded a very high level of concentration on the task to produce the&#xD;
      expected self-referencing bias. However, it is difficult to rule out the possibility that due&#xD;
      to ongoing mental-health issues, the participants in the patient group were less able to&#xD;
      concentrate on the task. In fact, their data may support this interpretation as the patient&#xD;
      group showed much less responses to images related to both self and others relative to the&#xD;
      overall responses by the control group. It is therefore possible that their finding could be&#xD;
      due to this extraneous factor rather than their patients being unable to discriminate a&#xD;
      self-face from a stranger's face. Second, the self-reference bias in the control group could&#xD;
      be explained by the familiarity with self-face relative to strangers' faces. However, the&#xD;
      degree of the familiarity between faces of oneself and others may be different between the&#xD;
      two groups. Unlike the control participants, patients with dissociative identity disorder&#xD;
      might not be interested or equally interested in their own face hence they might look into&#xD;
      mirrors or personal photos less frequently. If so, it may reduce the sensitivity of their&#xD;
      detection of the self-face relative to other familiar faces, thus the difference between the&#xD;
      two groups might be due to their different level of familiarity with self faces, rather than&#xD;
      the lack of self-bias in the patient group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To rule out these alternative explanations, the proposed study will adopt a test first&#xD;
      developed by the investigators. The test has been widely used over the past 10 years as an&#xD;
      objective measure of self-bias and positive emotion. The test has gone beyond self-report&#xD;
      measures typically used in psychiatry. The task completely eliminates the issues of&#xD;
      differential familiarity. Instead of using familiar self-related information such as&#xD;
      self-face and self-name, participants in this test are simply asked to learn some novel&#xD;
      associations between some simple geometric shapes and labels representing different&#xD;
      identities (Self, Friend, Stranger). For example, a participant could be told that a&#xD;
      rectangle represents the participant, a circle represents the participant's friend, and a&#xD;
      triangle represents a stranger. After the learning the associations, participants are shown&#xD;
      either a correct shape-label paring (such as rectangle-participant and circle-friend) or&#xD;
      incorrect pairing (such as circle-participant and triangle-friend). The participant's task is&#xD;
      simply to make a simple 'yes' or 'no' response as quickly and as accurately as possible. Each&#xD;
      pair is presented on a computer display until the participant makes a response. Thus the task&#xD;
      does not require highly focused attention, which could potentially be an unreasonable demand&#xD;
      for some patients. Also, unlike the test used in the aforementioned study that could be more&#xD;
      difficult to implement because it requires taking a picture of the participant's face without&#xD;
      their knowledge, our test may be a more feasible and reliable way of indexing the&#xD;
      self-reference bias in patients with various psychiatric conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For normal participants tested in numerous studies, the typical finding of the matching test&#xD;
      is a highly robust response time and accuracy advantage for judging the self-related pair&#xD;
      relative to the others-related pairs. Self-referencing bias can be found in other tasks. For&#xD;
      example, the investigators found previously that participants respond to self-face images&#xD;
      more quickly than their friends' faces and the same effects are found in different cultures&#xD;
      although the effects can be stronger in one culture than another.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This measurement has been applied to a wide range of populations such as old adults and&#xD;
      patients with brain lesions. Ageing, for example, can enhance response bias to friends,&#xD;
      whereas visual extinction caused by parietal lobe lesion can leave the self-bias intact. The&#xD;
      aim of this project is to apply this objective test for the first time to examine if the new&#xD;
      measures can be used to track changes in self-representation in psychiatric disorders. This&#xD;
      project comprises a novel collaboration between experimental psychology and psychiatry. The&#xD;
      project will provide a proof-of-principle analysis of the clinical utility in various types&#xD;
      of disorders. Our goal is to deepen understanding of the relationship between these disorders&#xD;
      and abnormal pattern of self-concept.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis. The self-matching task in this project will provide the key answers to our&#xD;
      research question. The main prediction of the study is that patients suffering from&#xD;
      psychiatric disorders will show atypical self-referencing effect compared to results of the&#xD;
      control group. This hypothesis is based on the theory that a coherent self-construal is the&#xD;
      driving cause of the self-referencing effect. It requires a person to have a clear&#xD;
      self-recognition and highly sensitive to self-referential information. In our self-matching&#xD;
      task, this will be reflected by faster and more accurate responses to self-shape associations&#xD;
      than other-shape associations. The effect in normal control is calculated by subtracting the&#xD;
      mean of response time and response accuracy to self-referential shape from that to&#xD;
      other-referential shape. The effect is usually about 5-10% based on the results in the past&#xD;
      research. The investigators expect the effect to be lower than this in most of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method Participants. There will be two groups of participants, a patient group and a control&#xD;
      group. Each group will have 60 participants. Patient group will consist of people admitted to&#xD;
      an acute psychiatric ward. They will have a range of diagnoses comprising the spectrum of&#xD;
      serious psychiatric disorders such as mood and anxiety disorders, psychotic disorders, and&#xD;
      personality disorders. The control group will consist of age, gender, education matched&#xD;
      participants who have no mental health issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and procedure. Participants will attend one test session. They will be tested&#xD;
      individually and will be given two tasks. The first will require completing questionnaires of&#xD;
      mood state. The second will be a computerised task on self-matching.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Task 1: Questionnaires. To record the mood state, the investigators will use Positive and&#xD;
      Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS-X) questionnaires&#xD;
      (https://www.toolshero.com/psychology/personal-happiness/panas-scale/). The questionnaires&#xD;
      contain two scales to measure a person's positive and negative emotions, respectively. The&#xD;
      items on the questionnaires are 20 adjective words, such as 'Enthusiastic' (positive),&#xD;
      'Active' (positive), 'Guilty' (negative), and 'Upset' (negative). Participants are asked to&#xD;
      indicate the extent to which each word describes how they have felt on the date of their&#xD;
      participation based on a 5-point rating scale, where 1 = very slightly/not at all and 5 =&#xD;
      extremely. This rating task takes less than five minutes to complete. The purpose of this&#xD;
      task is to examine the effect of current mood on the result of the self-matching task. The&#xD;
      investigators expect the low-mood to be associated with a lower self-referencing effect. This&#xD;
      task will take about five minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Task 2: Self matching. This is a computer-based task, which will be implemented after the&#xD;
      questionnaires task. The purpose of this test is to measure self-bias. Participants will be&#xD;
      taught to associate a geometric shape (such as a circle/square/triangle) with the self, and&#xD;
      another shape with a close friend, and the third shape with a stranger. The assignment of the&#xD;
      shape to a person will be counterbalanced across participants. These pairings will be shown&#xD;
      on a computer display for participants to remember. After this initial learning stage,&#xD;
      participants will be shown a series of a simultaneously presented pair of a shape and a label&#xD;
      (self/friend/stranger). Half of these pairs are correctly matched, and the rest are&#xD;
      mismatched. The order of matched or mismatched pairs will be random. The participants will be&#xD;
      asked to judge on each trial whether the presented shape-label pair is a correct match.&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to make a response as quickly and accurately as possible. A&#xD;
      feedback message will be given for each response, which will inform the participant of&#xD;
      whether the response was correct. Participants will be informed of their overall accuracy and&#xD;
      response time at the end of each block. This is used to engage the participant for best task&#xD;
      performance. The task will last about 10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis. The investigators will use (i) ANOVA to test the differences of self-related&#xD;
      processing between the patient and control groups, and (ii) correlation analyses to assess&#xD;
      the changes of self-representation in relation to the mood questionnaires and self-report&#xD;
      measures.&#xD;
