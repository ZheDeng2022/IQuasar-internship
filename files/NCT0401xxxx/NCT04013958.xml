  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who present to the emergency department (ED), with acute pain due to renal colic,&#xD;
      are often treated with opioids. Treatment with opioids has many disadvantages -&#xD;
      cardio-respiratory depression, nausea, vomiting and long term dependence. For these reasons,&#xD;
      there is a constant search for a way to reduce the use of opioids. ketamine has been proven&#xD;
      to augmented the analgesic effect of opioids, and thus reduce the use and adverse effects of&#xD;
      opioids. Different studies about the use of Ketamine as a sedition agent have shown that&#xD;
      Ketamine given IM versus IV has longer duration of effect with less adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study we are conducting is designed to test and analyze the safety and efficacy of IV&#xD;
      Ketamine with IV Morphine compared to IV Ketamine and morphine with IM placebo in a setting&#xD;
      of acute pain due to, or suspected renal colic in the ED. When both ways of administration&#xD;
      are given by the protocol as is customary for treatment of pain in the Emergency Medicine&#xD;
      department, and will be a prospective, randomized, double blind, controlled study.&#xD;

      The procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Eligible patients will be identified by the ED personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Research physician will address the patient, explain about the trial and ask the patient&#xD;
           to sign a consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The patient will be randomized and assigned to a trial group: &quot;A&quot; or &quot;B&quot; and it will be&#xD;
           noted in the Data sheet.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. According to physician order (IV amount and IM amount) and patient group assignment, the&#xD;
           nurse will prepare and administer the different drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Patients in group &quot;A&quot; wiil receive IV Ketamine with IV morphine and IM placebo of normal&#xD;
           saline. Patients in group &quot;B&quot; wiil receive IM Ketamine with IV morphine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The amount will be calculated based on the patients' weight:&#xD;
&#xD;
           IV Morphine -0.1 mg/kg: Morphine vial contains 10 mg/10 ml. IV Ketamine -0.1 mg/kg:&#xD;
           Ketamine vial contains 50 mg/1 ml. IM Ketamine -0.25 mg/kg: Ketamine vial contains 50&#xD;
           mg/1 ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Prior to administering medication to the patient a research assistant, who is blinded to&#xD;
           the choice of drugs given, will measure vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate and O2&#xD;
           saturation) as well as pain level on a 100 mm VAS (visual analogue scale) questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. After administration of medications the researcher assistant will measure vital signs&#xD;
           (blood pressure, heart rate and O2 saturation) as well as pain level on a 100 mm VAS&#xD;
           questionnaire, at 5 and 10 minutes after administration, and then at 30, 45, 60, and 90&#xD;
           minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Measurement of vital signs will not interfere with any other treatment that the patients&#xD;
           receives for their injury in the ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Cardiorespiratory follow-up (as per bullet point number 8 above), will be concluded at&#xD;
           1.5 hours post-intervention, and clinical follow-up will continue as long as the patient&#xD;
           remains in the ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. During the time of the the followup and after, if pain had not subsided sufficiently&#xD;
           according to treating physician's clinical assessment, patient will receive further&#xD;
           analgesic medications by physician order, as per ED protocol. The protocol takes into&#xD;
           account concurrent medications.&#xD;
