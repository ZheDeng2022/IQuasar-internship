  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with severe strokes are often unable to be take oral diet food and fluids safely&#xD;
      because they cannot swallow effectively. Therefore, patients need to be fed via a tube placed&#xD;
      through the nose into the stomach (nasogastric tube). Tube feeding can be given by the&#xD;
      intermittent (bolus) method, whereby the feed is given over a short time (15 to 30 minutes),&#xD;
      or by the continuous feeding method, where the feed is given continuously over 10-16 hours.&#xD;
      Nasogastric feeding can be complicated by vomiting or reflux of the feed into the oesophagus&#xD;
      causing aspiration of gastric contents into the lung and pneumonia. Nasogastric feeds can be&#xD;
      given continuously or as bolus feeds. Healthy people eating normally take their diet in&#xD;
      discrete meals. The human digestive system is adapted to intermittent food intake and is&#xD;
      likely to work best if food is provided in this pattern, but the larger volume of the feed by&#xD;
      this method may cause vomiting and aspiration. It is unclear which method is better for&#xD;
      allowing normal digestive processes and reducing pneumonia due to aspirated feeds. There are&#xD;
      no trials comparing these two feeding methods in patients with acute stroke. The aim of this&#xD;
      small study is to determine if a trial comparing the two treatment approaches is feasible in&#xD;
      patients with acute stroke, and to collect information on the effects on feed tolerance and&#xD;
      digestion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study we will compare the effect of the bolus and intermittent nasogastric tube&#xD;
      feeding on digestion and feed tolerance in 20 patients who need nasogastric feeding within 36&#xD;
      hours of a stroke. Patients will be randomly allocated to be given the feeds either by the&#xD;
      bolus or by the continuous method for 7 days. During this time they will be examined every&#xD;
      day. The study will examine how effectively food is digested by measuring the amount of feed&#xD;
      given and the metabolic responses of the body by looking at changes in the level of blood&#xD;
      sugar and digestive hormones. The investigators will also monitor complications such as&#xD;
      vomiting, diarrhoea, and pneumonia. Patients will be randomly allocated to be given the feeds&#xD;
      either by the bolus or by the continuous method for 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will provide information which will allow the investigators to design a larger&#xD;
      definitive study to conclusively prove which method is more appropriate.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients admitted to the acute stroke unit at University Hospitals of North Midlands NHS&#xD;
      Trust and who require nasogastric (NG) feeding will be eligible for recruitment, patients&#xD;
      will be screened and assessed for eligibility on the stroke unit by a member of the local&#xD;
      research team, confirmed by a medical practitioner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent- Informed consent will be sought from patients after full oral and written&#xD;
      information about the nature and purpose of the study, potential risks and benefits,&#xD;
      alternative treatments, and the right to refuse and to withdraw at any time. In cases where&#xD;
      the patient lacks the capacity to give fully informed consent, the patient will be informed&#xD;
      as much as he/she is able to understand with the option to refuse, and fully informed consent&#xD;
      will be sought from a consultee. The oral and written information will be provided to the&#xD;
      consultee including the same information as would be given to the patient. If the patient has&#xD;
      capacity to consent for themselves, but unable to sign because of impairmentsÍ¾ verbal&#xD;
      consent, witnessed and signed by an independent observer, will be documented. Where the&#xD;
      patient has capacity to consent for themselves, but only able to make a mark on the paper&#xD;
      rather than sign as required, the same procedure will be followed. Confirmation of consent&#xD;
      will be sought in patients who are recruited with consent from a consultee, but regain&#xD;
      capacity prior to the end of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the nature of the study, patients or their consultee will have to decide within a few&#xD;
      hours of admission to hospital. They will be given the opportunity to discuss the study with&#xD;
      a relative or friend. Participants or their consultee will be free to withdraw from the trial&#xD;
      at any time without giving reasons and without prejudicing further treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An age-matched healthy control group will be recruited from patients' relatives and friends&#xD;
      to provide a normal baseline for the metabolic response to normal feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The original signed consent form will be filed in the case report form. One copy will be&#xD;
      given to the patient or consultee, another copy will be sent to the trial coordinating centre&#xD;
      and another will be filed in the patients' notes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant information sheets, and consent forms, will not be available in other&#xD;
      languages. If needed, the usual hospital interpreter and translator services will be&#xD;
      available to assist with discussion of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a participant is able to consent for the study but later becomes incapacitated, the&#xD;
      original consent will endure the loss of capacity as long as the trial has not significantly&#xD;
      altered since the original consent was given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation- Participants will be randomized into the intervention or control groups using&#xD;
      a computerized random number generator. The randomization procedure will be conducted by an&#xD;
      independent statistician at Keele University. Sealed and numbered opaque envelopes containing&#xD;
      the allocated intervention will be kept in the research office on the acute stroke ward. For&#xD;
      each randomisation the envelope with the lowest number will be used. The envelopes will be&#xD;
      selected and opened by the research nurse following consent and baseline assessment. An email&#xD;
      containing the Participant ID and the number of the envelope will be sent to the Principal&#xD;
      Investigator. A copy of the original randomisation codes will be kept independently by the&#xD;
      sponsor in the Trial Master File. Assessments-&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A daily log of symptoms and signs of feed intolerance and pneumonia will be taken for 7&#xD;
           days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A venous blood sample for a full blood count and C-reactive Protein will be taken on day&#xD;
           1, 3, and 7.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A Chest x-Ray will be conducted on day 7 to confirm/exclude evidence of pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Glucose level measurements will be taken every 10 minutes for each participant for 5&#xD;
           days following randomisation, using a sensor inserted into the subcutaneous tissue by&#xD;
           the trained research nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Daily for 5 days following randomisation fasting venous plasma glucose, apart from the&#xD;
           day that the hormonal profile is collected, samples are to be taken by the research&#xD;
           nurse and processed by the pathology department.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All participants, including healthy controls, will have a hormonal profile in response&#xD;
           to feeding will be taken on day 4, post randomisation. The continuous feed, the bolus&#xD;
           feed or, in the non-stroke control group, a calorific drink that is equivalent calories&#xD;
           to the Naso-Gastric feed (e.g. Ensure plus) will be given as the first meal in the&#xD;
           morning after an overnight fast. Venous plasma glucose and insulin levels will be&#xD;
           checked both fasting, immediately after the meal, and every 30 minutes in response to NG&#xD;
           feed for 4 hours after the meal (total of 10 sets of samples per subject, each set&#xD;
           comprising 2ml clotted sample and 1ml fluoride oxalate sample). For patients who are on&#xD;
           NG feeding, the sample collection will similarly start at -30 and 0 minute before the NG&#xD;
           feed (either bolus or continuous feed) and then every 30 minutes for 4 hours (total of&#xD;
           10 samples). The venous plasma glucose sample collected for the hormonal profile will&#xD;
           also be used for the daily fasting venous plasma glucose sample (see above). We will&#xD;
           primarily calculate the time averaged mean insulin and glucose responses computed as&#xD;
           incremental AUCs (above baseline), divided by the time interval (hours). Values at each&#xD;
           individual time point will be compared directly. The investigators will also collect&#xD;
           data on total glycaemic exposure (glucose AUC 0-240) and the insulinogenic index&#xD;
           (ÎI30/ÎG30) as an index of Î²-cell response.&#xD;
