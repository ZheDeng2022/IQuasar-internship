      Single centered diary-based study to identify course and characteristics of hormone&#xD;
      withdrawal headaches/migraines in users of combined hormonal contraceptives Objectives of the&#xD;
      Research Project: to identify the course and characteristics of hormone withdrawal&#xD;
      headaches/migraines in users of combined hormonal contraceptives (CHC)&#xD;

      Participant recruitment is performed through advertisement placed in University Zürich (USZ)&#xD;
      online. Advertisement in offices of neurologists and headache specialists, homepage of the&#xD;
      Swiss headache society.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interested women contact the investigators via email and are called back by one of the study&#xD;
      doctors or students within 1 day from Monday-Friday. This phone call is thought to inform the&#xD;
      women about the study in more detail and for the investigators to check eligibility. During&#xD;
      this call the participants are informed about the study procedure and can ask any question.&#xD;
      Here most important points are use of a CHC in a 21/7 regimen, regular (at least once on two&#xD;
      months) withdrawal migraine/headaches, intention to continue the use of the contraceptive for&#xD;
      3 more months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the participants decide to participate, inclusion and exclusion criteria are checked. If&#xD;
      women are applicable they receive the consent form and the study information with an envelope&#xD;
      for return. If more questions come up the investigators are available per email and phone for&#xD;
      answers. If a patient doesn't return the consent form the investigator will delete the&#xD;
      personal data, which collected before. Only the year of birth will be noted in the personal&#xD;
      data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After consent participants receive headaches diaries (with mail /post) and a prepaid envelope&#xD;
      (for return). Participants are also offered the option to return their diaries electronically&#xD;
      via email to the study doctor. Furthermore participants receive in a second phone contact&#xD;
      instructions, how to fill in the headache diary and the day of study start (first day of the&#xD;
      next pill package).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Headache diaries should be returned monthly (per email or post) and are conducted for 3 pill&#xD;
      cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If complete headache diaries are not returned participants will be contacted per email after&#xD;
      1 week to remind the participants. If this email is not being answered within another week a&#xD;
      phone contact will take place to identify potential reasons for noncompliance or withdrawal&#xD;
      of consent or drop out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observation period 3 pill cycles : 3 times 28 days&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes of the Research Project:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Daily number of headaches and migraine in each day of the observation cycle.and during&#xD;
           the Hormone-free interval (HFI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  First day of migraine in the pill-free interval&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Start of migraine in relation to withdrawal bleeding&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Start of and number of prolonged migraines &gt;24 hours in the pill-free interval and the&#xD;
           phase of hormone intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pain intensity in the pill-free interval in comparison to the pill-phase&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of rescue medications/ migraine day during HFI and during pill intake&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  efficacy of the medications (did medication stop the attack and did the attack return&#xD;
           after maximal 8 hours)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Within patient variability of the first migraine day in the HFI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary and secondary endpoints will be calculated as frequencies and percentages.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For comparison the number of prolonged attacks during pill use and the HFI prolonged&#xD;
           attacks per day of the observation interval are calculated and thereafter chi-square&#xD;
           test for comparisons is used .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Software programme is used for data analyses.&#xD;
