  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A novel epidural delivery regimen was developed: Variable volume automated mandatory bolus&#xD;
      (AMB) (VVAMB) will advance individualisation of labour epidural analgesia, by which a larger&#xD;
      volume of bolus may contribute to better spread of the local anaesthetics within brief period&#xD;
      and thereby reduces the chances of motor blockade that could reduce instrumental deliveries.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epidural analgesia is the gold standard of pain relief for labour pain. Despite this, up to&#xD;
      50% of parturients continue to experience pain leading to suffering and increased caregiver&#xD;
      workload. There is also higher risk of motor blockade found in those receiving epidural&#xD;
      analgesia, and these factors is associated with dysfunctional labour requiring obstetric&#xD;
      intervention (instrumental delivery). Automated mandatory bolus (AMB) of variable-frequency&#xD;
      (VAMB) has been shown to provide better pain relief as compared with conventional&#xD;
      patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) with basal infusion, however its long lockout&#xD;
      time per hour is associated with unsuccessful patient bolus requests, with similar motor&#xD;
      block to conventional regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators therefore proposes to develop a novel epidural delivery regimen: Variable&#xD;
      volume AMB (VVAMB) will advance individualisation of labour epidural analgesia, by which a&#xD;
      larger volume of bolus may contribute to better spread of the local anaesthetics within brief&#xD;
      period and thereby reduces the chances of motor blockade that could reduce instrumental&#xD;
      deliveries. This algorithm development including pilot and clinical trial will compare VVAMB&#xD;
      with VAMB regimens, in reducing the incidence of motor block in 216 term women requesting for&#xD;
      labour epidural analgesia.&#xD;

    <measure>Incidence of motor block in each group</measure>
    <time_frame>During labour (1 day)</time_frame>
    <description>The number of event of motor block throughout the labour. Previous studies have shown that epidural analgesia using high concentrations of local anaesthetics could lead to decreased motor functions, and are subsequently associated with an increased incidence of instrumented delivery and longer second stage of labour. In this study, the intensity of motor block is assessed by the patient's ability to move their lower extremities via a modified Bromage scale. In the modified version, a scoring of 0 implies no motor block (Free movement of both legs and feet), scoring of 1 implies partial block (Just able to flex knees with free movement of feet), 2 implies almost complete block (Unable to flex knees but with free movement of feet) and 3 implies a full block (Unable to move legs/ feet).</description>

    <description>The Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity, and Respiration (APGAR) score is a test given to newborns soon after birth. In the test, five are being evaluated: Appearance (skin color), Pulse (heart rate), Grimace response (reflexes), Activity (muscle tone) and Respiration (breathing rate and effort). Each is scored on a scale of 0 to 2, with 2 being the best score; a total score of ten represents the best possible condition.</description>
