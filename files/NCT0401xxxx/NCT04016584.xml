    <textblock>
      Currently in the United States, the achieved level of glycemic control for adult Latinos with&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes (T2D) is sub-optimal compared to the non-Latino Caucasian population. Among&#xD;
      Latinos with T2D, there are unique barriers, such as socioeconomic and cultural factors, to&#xD;
      starting and optimizing therapies, including insulin. Latinos have cultural beliefs and&#xD;
      behaviors specific to this population that should be appropriately addressed in a diabetes&#xD;
      self-management education and support program. Diabetes Pueblo is a diabetes education&#xD;
      program that may be a solution to help address the barriers Latinos with T2D have to diabetes&#xD;
      care and insulin use. The Diabetes Pueblo program consists of two targeted diabetes education&#xD;
      curriculums for the local Latino community: (a) Diabetes Fundamentals and (b) Insulin&#xD;
      Success, a culturally appropriate program course addressing barriers to initiating and&#xD;
      optimizing insulin and T2D therapies. We will explore if Diabetes Pueblo Program improves&#xD;
      knowledge of lifestyle advice for healthy eating and physical activity, increase the&#xD;
      propensity to use insulin when clinically indicated, and improve success rates with insulin&#xD;
      therapy by addressing common fears and negative perceptions of T2D therapies in this&#xD;
      population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a group of chronic disorders typified by raised blood glucose&#xD;
      levels. An estimated 30 million people in the United States (US) (9.4% of the population)&#xD;
      have diabetes. Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is defined by a rapid onset, often in childhood, and&#xD;
      insulin dependence; while type 2 diabetes (T2D) is considered to have a slow onset and&#xD;
      insulin insensitivity. Insulin is a required form of treatment for all T1D, and T2D patients&#xD;
      who cannot achieve glycemic control through exercise and diet or other medications alone.&#xD;
      Currently in the United States, the achieved level of glycemic control for adult Latinos with&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes (T2D) is sub-optimal compared to the non-Latino Caucasian population. Among&#xD;
      Latinos with T2D, there are unique barriers to starting and optimizing therapies, including&#xD;
      insulin. Barriers include socioeconomic and cultural factors, as well as inadequate&#xD;
      encouragement from health care providers. There are also challenges associated with access to&#xD;
      timely and appropriate diabetes education. Some of these barriers may improve by using&#xD;
      trained community health workers from the Latino community, as there is evidence that they&#xD;
      are effective in supporting adherence and persistence with therapies (including insulin) and&#xD;
      in encouraging lifestyle changes for T2D patients within their own communities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 2017 National Standards of Care for Diabetes Self-Management Education and Support&#xD;
      (DSME/S) outline quality, evidenced based guidelines for DSME/S programs and guide those who&#xD;
      will be providing these services. Benefits of DSME/S programs include improved clinical&#xD;
      outcomes such as HbA1c and quality of life while reducing hospitalizations and health care&#xD;
      costs. Hispanics are known to have a higher prevalence of diabetes, but use of DSME/S&#xD;
      programs are vastly underutilized which means that many individuals in the Latino community&#xD;
      with T2D are likely not receiving critical DSME/S services. It is crucial that DSME/S&#xD;
      services be aligned with the needs of the target population in order to increase adherence&#xD;
      and improve health outcomes. Latinos have cultural beliefs and behaviors specific to this&#xD;
      population that should be appropriately addressed in a DSME/S program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetes Pueblo is a diabetes education program that may be a solution to help address the&#xD;
      barriers Latinos with T2D have to diabetes care and insulin use. The Diabetes Pueblo program&#xD;
      consists of two targeted diabetes education curriculums for the local Latino community: (a)&#xD;
      Diabetes Fundamentals and (b) Insulin Success, a culturally appropriate program course&#xD;
      addressing barriers to initiating and optimizing insulin and T2D therapies. Trained community&#xD;
      health workers, also known as promotores, will deliver both programs. Ultimately, we will&#xD;
      explore if Diabetes Pueblo Program improves knowledge of lifestyle advice for healthy eating&#xD;
      and physical activity, increase the propensity to use insulin when clinically indicated, and&#xD;
      improve success rates with insulin therapy by addressing common fears and negative&#xD;
      perceptions of T2D therapies in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective pilot study. The Diabetes Pueblo program applied in this study is one&#xD;
      program that consists of two newly created, targeted education curriculums for T2D Latino&#xD;
      adults delivered over the course of 11 weeks by designated promotores, community health&#xD;
      workers, to approximately 20 study participants at Sansum Diabetes Research Institute.&#xD;

    <description>The Diabetes Self-Management Questionnaire consists of 16 questions to evaluate diabetes self-care including glucose management, dietary control, physical activity, and health-care use. Questions are rated on a 4 point scale - 0 Does not apply to me, 1 Applies to me to some degree, 2 Applies to me to a considerable degree, 3 Applies to me very much. This yields an overall rating of self-care with higher scores indicating more effective diabetes self-care.</description>

    <description>The Insulin Treatment Appraisal Scale is a validated 20-item questionnaire that will be used in insulin naïve and insulin-treated patients with type 2 diabetes to assess positive and negative perceptions regarding insulin treatment. Items are rated on a 5-point scale (&quot;strongly disagree&quot; to &quot;strongly agree&quot;) and the mean of individual item scores is calculated to obtain a total score, with lower scores indicating less negative perceptions regarding insulin treatment.</description>
