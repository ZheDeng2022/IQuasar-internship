      Introduction: Pilonidal sinus disease (PSD) is a common surgical disease frequently seen in&#xD;
      the intergluteal cleft. The treatment of this problem is mainly surgical.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: introduce a novel technique of combined open and closed approach for management of&#xD;
      primary pilonidal sinus (non-recurrent) by special U-shaped sutures and compare it with other&#xD;
      techniques as regard operative time, time of complete wound healing, postoperative pain ,&#xD;
      time to stop analgesic drugs and evaluate the result of surgery without drain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients: this study was conducted on 160 patients with PSD in the sacrococcygeal region who&#xD;
      underwent operation between December 2015 and December 2017. All cases are divided randomly&#xD;
      into four groups each consists of 40 patients.&#xD;

      1. Introduction Pilonidal sinus disease (PSD) is a common disease seen in the intergluteal&#xD;
           cleft. This disease is usually seen between the ages of 15 years and 35 years, and males&#xD;
           are affected more often than females [1]. The incidence of the disease is 26/100,000 in&#xD;
           the general population [2]. The most accepted theory for this disease development is the&#xD;
           penetration of shed hair into the skin and is associated with inflammation, abscess and&#xD;
           sinus formation [1]. The depth of the intergluteal sulcus, the number of loose hair, and&#xD;
           the stiffness of the hairs play important role in the disease etiology [3]. The reason&#xD;
           for the wide acceptance of the acquired theory may be the high recurrence rates of up to&#xD;
           30% even after the most radical local excisions of pilonidal disease, which suggests&#xD;
           that a pilonidal sinus is an acquired new disease rather than the persistence of some&#xD;
           existing sinuses [4]. Although many medical and surgical methods have been proposed for&#xD;
           this disease management, no clear consensus about the best method of treatment has been&#xD;
           reported so far in the literature. Medical treatment modalities include phenol, silver&#xD;
           nitrate, and electro cauterization of the cavity .The surgical options include excising&#xD;
           the sinus to the level of the sacrococcygeal fascia and primary closure, or leaving it&#xD;
           to secondary healing, Z-plasty, split-skin grafting, Rhomboid flap rotation, or&#xD;
           Karydakis flap [5]. Eradication of the pilonidal sinus through wide surgical excision is&#xD;
           still the cornerstone of treatment, yielding good long-term results, but at the expense&#xD;
           of postoperative complications, prolonged hospital stay and a period of off-work up to&#xD;
           4-8 weeks, substantial pain, sub-optimal aesthetic results and recurrence [6].&#xD;
&#xD;
           The main problem after PSD surgery is recurrence, and recurrence rates have been&#xD;
           reported in the literature to range from 3% to 46%, depending on the technique used [7].&#xD;
&#xD;
           The aim of the present study was to analyze , evaluate and compare the short term and&#xD;
           long term clinical results of this novel technique of combined closed and open approach&#xD;
           for management of pilonidal sinus by special U-shaped sutures without drain, Rhomboid&#xD;
           flap technique, Karydakis technique and open technique, an approach that allows surgeons&#xD;
           to overcome these techniques complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Materials and methods This is a controlled clinical trial on 160 patients who had been&#xD;
           operated on for PSD between December 2015 and December 2017 in faculty of medicine,&#xD;
           Zagazig University, after approval from medical ethical committee. Fifteen patients were&#xD;
           lost during the study as we cannot reach them by any way and were excluded from the&#xD;
           study. The remaining consecutive patients were included in this prospective analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The patients were divided into 4 groups: Group A: 40 patients underwent combined open&#xD;
           and closed technique, Group B: 40 patients underwent Rhomboid flap technique, Group C:&#xD;
           40 patients underwent Karydakis technique and Group D: 40 patients underwent open&#xD;
           technique and wound is left to heal with secondary intention. Patients are grouped&#xD;
           randomizally that patient 1 went to group A and patient 2 went to group B and patient 3&#xD;
           went to group c and patient 4 went to group D and the process is repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Time of operation, postoperative morbidity and hospital stay, and loss of work days,&#xD;
           duration of wound healing and recurrence were analyzed. Informed consent was obtained&#xD;
           from all individual participants included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Inclusion criteria include primary PSD in intergluteal region between 18-35 years. Also&#xD;
           those fulfilling the diagnostic criteria of Chronic discharging sinus/sinuses in natal&#xD;
           cleft with or without surrounding tissue inflammation and with associated pain and&#xD;
           bleeding on clinical evaluation were also included in our study. Exclusion criteria&#xD;
           include recurrent pilonidal sinus, patients who were terminally ill, had Uncontrolled&#xD;
           diabetics, were Immunocompromised and immunosuppressed patients, had acute pilonidal&#xD;
           abscess.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The patients with PSD underwent the procedure by the same surgeon. Infected sinuses were&#xD;
           treated with antibiotics prior to the surgery for at least 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The patient's age, sex, operation time, mean hospital stay, postoperative wound&#xD;
           complications, cosmetic appearance and recurrence rate, and hypoesthesia in the gluteal&#xD;
           region were recorded during follow-up period. Clinical assessments were performed&#xD;
           postoperatively on the 1st day, 3rd day, 7th day, and 10th day and by telephone on the&#xD;
           1st month, 3rd month, 6th month, and 12th month.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.1. Operative technique The patients were hospitalized, and the site of the operation&#xD;
           was shaved on the day of the surgery. All Patients were operated on under spinal&#xD;
           anesthesia. Antibiotic was administered to all patients as prophylaxis 60 minutes prior&#xD;
           to the surgery. An adhesive tape was used to part the buttocks. The patients were placed&#xD;
           in the jack-knife position. (Fig. 1). Methylene blue was injected without pressure&#xD;
           through the external opening to delineate the sinus. The operation site was cleaned with&#xD;
           10% povidone-iodine. All sinus tracts were resected en bloc via elliptical incision down&#xD;
           to presacral fascia with meticulous hemostasis. (Fig 2)(Fig.3).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Group A:The wound was closed with 0 polypropylene sutures including skin, subcutaneous&#xD;
           tissue and including the presacral fascia starting 5cm from the edge of the wound and&#xD;
           pass to the other side 5cm from the edge of the wound including presacral fascia,&#xD;
           subcutaneous tissue and the skin. Then pass 2cm from the edge of the wound and pass&#xD;
           through the three layers to the other side in double u-shaped sutures. Multiple sutures&#xD;
           are used according to the length of the wound. Sutures were approximated together&#xD;
           without tension (Fig. 4-11).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Group B:Rhomboid flap technique: involve closure of the defect after excision of all&#xD;
           sinuses with Rhomboid flap of skin and subcutaneous tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Group C: Karydakis flap technique: the long axis of the ellipse is parallel to the&#xD;
           midline and 2cm from it.undercutting incision is made along the whole length 1cm below&#xD;
           the skin surface then unrolling the flap over the midline.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Group D: Open procedure involved a wide excision of the pilonidal sinus tract and&#xD;
           healing by secondary intention.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.2. Postoperative follow-up Postoperative management included pressure dressings, low&#xD;
           residual diet until the fifth postoperative day, inspection of dressings in every other&#xD;
           day, and suture removal on the 21th postoperative day. Instructions on discharge&#xD;
           included avoidance of prolonged sitting and riding a bicycle until 8 weeks&#xD;
           postoperatively to prevent wound disruption, improving local hygiene and regular removal&#xD;
           of hairs by depilatory creams.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Before discharge from hospital, patients are asked to return to the clinic on&#xD;
           postoperative Day 3, Day 7, and Day 10. The skin sutures were removed on the 21th&#xD;
           postoperative day. The long-term follow-up (1st month, 3rd month, 6th month, and 12th&#xD;
           month) was performed via outpatient interview or by telephone interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Successful treatment was the healing of the wound by subcutaneous scar formation and&#xD;
           epithelization of the wound at 8-12 weeks. If skin and subcutaneous tissue reopened with&#xD;
           discharge, it is reported as wound dehiscence. The wound that seemed to have healed&#xD;
           within the first 8 weeks but recurred later on during the study period (either&#xD;
           re-opening of a primarily healed pit or emerging of a new one) was documented as&#xD;
           recurrence. A visual analogue scale (VAS) score was used to assess pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative data were expressed as absolute frequencies (number) &amp; relative frequencies&#xD;
      (percentage). Categorical data were compared using Chi-square test. All tests were two sided.&#xD;
      p-value &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All data were collected, tabulated&#xD;
      and statistically analyzed using SPSS 20.0 for windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      . 4. Discussion There is still no consensus about treatment of pilonidal sinus disease.&#xD;
      Ideally, therapy should be associated with short hospital stay, less painful postoperative&#xD;
      time, rapidly healing and return to work, less painful dressing of wound, short term wound&#xD;
      care and a low recurrence rate. No techniques fulfill all of these criteria. We compared our&#xD;
      results with other studies to estimate the reliability of our data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pilonidal sinus is more common in male [8]. In our study, male predominate than female (out&#xD;
      of the total 160 patients 85% were males and 15% were females). Men are more affected thanks&#xD;
      to their natural hirsutism.Most patients were young with the mean age in Group-A being 24.43&#xD;
      (SD ±6.08) and the mean age in Group-B was 27.40 (SD ± 5.90), Group C was 25.4 ± 5.3, Group D&#xD;
      was 28.2±4.2. . Comparable results were shown in other similar studies [17].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute pilonidal abscess should be treated by incision and drainage. In the present study the&#xD;
      patients presenting with an acute abscess in the sacrococcygeal region in 12 cases that were&#xD;
      initially treated with incision and drainage then postoperatively they were treated by third&#xD;
      generation cephalosporin and metronidazole for 10 days. Patients were scheduled for our&#xD;
      technique after 15-30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a prospective randomized study performed on 50 patients and divided into two equal groups:&#xD;
      drained and non-drained. Fluid collections were encountered in two patients (8%) of the&#xD;
      drained group compared with eight patients (32%) in the no drained group with the difference&#xD;
      being statistically significant [9].In our study, absence of wound collection, Seroma and&#xD;
      hematoma in Group A and Group D are due to wide drainage by our special sutures technique and&#xD;
      the use of third generation cephalosporin antibiotics, choosing non-infected pilonidal&#xD;
      disease in most of cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A controlled study showed that wound problems, length of hospital stay, morbidity, and&#xD;
      recurrence rates did not increase in the absence of postoperative draining of the cavity.&#xD;
      Another study also demonstrated that drain placement after rhomboid excision and Limberg flap&#xD;
      technique might negatively affect the postoperative complication rate, although the mean&#xD;
      operation time was significantly longer in the non-drained group [10].In our study, we did&#xD;
      not use drain in group A and the results showed decreased hospital stay, no Seroma nor&#xD;
      hematoma , very low recurrence rate (2.5%) and infection occurred in one patient(2.5%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In group A: most patients stopped analgesic drug on postoperative 3 days. Our patients&#xD;
      started to sit on chair without pain on postoperative 10 days .It may result from low tension&#xD;
      in the wound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary closure technique's operation time is short but has significant postoperative&#xD;
      morbidity as wound infection rate is 12-32.7%, dehiscence rate is 10- 50% and recurrence rate&#xD;
      is 5-12% [11]. In this study, Group A showed infection in one patient(2.5%) and the&#xD;
      recurrence rate was low (2.5%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Incision and curettage, unroofing, curettage and excision with marsupialization procedures&#xD;
      are common used surgical techniques. But these procedures had painful postoperative time,&#xD;
      delayed healing and return to work, painful dressing of wound and long term wound care. But&#xD;
      they have a low recurrence rate [12]. In this study, postoperative pain was low on pain&#xD;
      scale, rapid wound healing, rapid return to work, and painless dressings and in addition, low&#xD;
      recurrence rate (1%) When the midline lateralized or flattened, recurrences are less likely&#xD;
      to occur [10].In our study there is partial flattening of the intergluteal cleft, and so the&#xD;
      recurrence rate was low (2.5%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hospital stay varied from 2 to 5 days [13]. Using wide-excision techniques and median time&#xD;
      off work was reported from 19 up to 38 days [14]. Other studies reported a mean length of&#xD;
      hospital stay 2-4 days [9]. In the present study the length of hospital stay was 1 day in&#xD;
      most cases of Group A and Group C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of wound infection was ranged from 0% to 12% [15]. In our study, Group A showed&#xD;
      Wound infection in one patient and Seroma did not occur in any patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gupta [16] reported recurrence rates of 13% using wide-excision techniques, while other&#xD;
      studies achieved 5% in larger trials [17]. A recurrence rate of 3-10% is described for&#xD;
      excision with marsupialization of the wound [18]. Reconstructive flaps according to Limberg's&#xD;
      technique come with a recurrence rate of 0-6% [13] in prospective randomized studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In classic Limberg flap technique recurrence rate is 1.26-5.3% [19]. In our study, Follow up&#xD;
      time is 12 months and recurrence rate was in one case only (2.5%). Some studies have shown&#xD;
      that, in addition to a good surgical technique, elimination of preventable risk factors such&#xD;
      as hygiene at the intergluteal sulcus is important to prevent recurrence [20] [21].Therefore,&#xD;
      patients in this study were advised regarding the importance of local hygiene.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary closure of the wound after excision of the pilonidal sinus is associated with a high&#xD;
      recurrence rate. In the literature, the recurrence rate after primary closure has ranged from&#xD;
      4% to 25% [21].&#xD;
&#xD;
      A common complaint after flap surgery was hypoesthesia on the flap, in our study hypothesia&#xD;
      occurred in 59 cases (37%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the problems of our study, there are two issues that have to be respected when&#xD;
      interpreting our results: First, the recurrence rate of this study might be higher than&#xD;
      demonstrated in the result due to shorter of follow up period and missing patients in the&#xD;
      follow up period. Second, the wound healing time might have been shorter than it is reported&#xD;
      in this study. The wound healing time was assessed by the patients themselves and was not&#xD;
      determined by a physician. The wound healing time might more reflect the disappearance of any&#xD;
      discomfort at the intergluteal fold than the complete closure of the skin after surgery.&#xD;
