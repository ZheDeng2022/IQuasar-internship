      1. This study is a pilot feasibility study to determine treatment effects to estimate&#xD;
           sample size for future studies that evaluate wound bacteria colonization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The secondary objective of this study aims to observe the effect of PED on an open wound&#xD;
           and its effects in wound bacteria colonization.&#xD;

      This study is designed as a pilot study where 30 patients receiving a below the knee&#xD;
      amputation with at least one open wound on the limb will be enrolled. Patients are identified&#xD;
      through medical records. The patients will be selected based on inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria through pre-screening through the Comprehensive Wound Center's Limb Preservation&#xD;
      Program and wound physicians/providers at Indiana University. The decision of amputation is&#xD;
      made independently of the study and is solely made by the patient and their&#xD;
      physician/provider. The provider decides based on the severity of the limb's condition&#xD;
      if/when the limb should be amputated and will schedule this surgery with the patient based on&#xD;
      current clinical standard of care. Study participation is decided independent of clinical&#xD;
      decision. Patients enrolled in the study will wear the Patterned Electric Dressing (PED) on&#xD;
      the wound(s) for up to 3 weeks or until amputation, whichever comes first and will have up to&#xD;
      a total of 4 study visits.&#xD;
