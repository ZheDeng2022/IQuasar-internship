  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary study objective is to evaluate local response to split-thickness skin grafts from&#xD;
      a matched bone marrow donor to chronic GVHD-affected skin in a hematopoietic stem cell&#xD;
      transplant patient.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While the mechanisms are still under active study, GVHD is thought to be a donor T-cell&#xD;
      mediated attack that preferentially targets three organs: skin, intestine, and liver. T&#xD;
      lymphocytes from the donor identify the patient's organ tissues as foreign and initiate&#xD;
      inflammation, leading to end organ damage. The investigator's traditional approach has been&#xD;
      to use immune suppressing drugs to dampen this inflammatory response after transplantation.&#xD;
      However, this approach is ultimately ineffective for a significant percentage of patients.&#xD;
      Therefore, the primary objective of this proposal is to test a novel non-immunosuppressive&#xD;
      approach to treatment of cutaneous GVHD using allogeneic skin grafting in an effort to&#xD;
      tolerize the engrafted immune system to skin it previously recognized as foreign. The&#xD;
      potential benefit to transplant patients is tremendous, including reduced immunosuppression,&#xD;
      improved quality of life and lower mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A potential novel approach is to apply split-thickness skin grafts from the bone marrow donor&#xD;
      to the affected patient's skin. There are four existing case reports that have shown positive&#xD;
      outcomes in wound healing in chronic GVHD-associated ulcers. In all four cases, skin grafts&#xD;
      were harvested from the patient's allogeneic HLA-matched sibling donors and placed over&#xD;
      non-healing wounds (2-5). One case described global improvement in affected skin distant from&#xD;
      the site of skin graft application, allowing for tapering of immunosuppressive medications.&#xD;
      This suggests potential induction of tolerance by immune cells within the donated skin.&#xD;

The CGAA is an 8-item assessment measuring symptom severity of GVHD on a scale from 0 (not present) to 10 (as bad as you can imagine). Global score is calculated by summing items.</description>
