  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial designed to assess the effect&#xD;
      of the GLP-1 receptor agonist, semaglutide, on visceral and ectopic fat, insulin resistance,&#xD;
      inflammation markers, and the downstream effect of cardiovascular risk in people with HIV.&#xD;
      The primary endpoints will be visceral and ectopic fat changes over the study period. The&#xD;
      secondary endpoints will include changes in markers of inflammation, immune activation, gut&#xD;
      integrity, and cardiovascular disease risk assessment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a phase IIb, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial of&#xD;
      semaglutide in people with HIV-associated lipohypertrophy. Participants will be recruited&#xD;
      from 2 different sites (Cleveland, OH and Charleston, SC). The duration of the study will be&#xD;
      56 weeks. The interventional phase will last 32 weeks, followed by a 24-week observational&#xD;
      phase to assess the sustainability of the intervention. Participants will be randomized 1:1&#xD;
      to receive semaglutide by subcutaneous injection once weekly for 32 weeks (8-week dose&#xD;
      escalation phase followed by full-dose for 24 weeks) or matching placebo. The primary&#xD;
      objective of this clinical trial is to determine the efficacy of semaglutide in treating&#xD;
      lipohypertrophy among non-diabetic people living with HIV by reducing fat accumulation and&#xD;
      ectopic fat deposition, altering adipokine levels, improving endothelial function and&#xD;
      arterial stiffness, down-regulating key pro-inflammatory cytokines and immune activation&#xD;
      without modifying microbial translocation and gut integrity markers.&#xD;

             experienced menarche and who has not undergone successful surgical sterilization&#xD;
             (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy), who is not&#xD;
             postmenopausal (defined as amenorrhea 12 consecutive months), or is on hormone&#xD;

             mIU/mL. Women who are using oral, implanted, or injectable contraceptive hormones or&#xD;
             mechanical products such as an intrauterine device or barrier methods (diaphragm,&#xD;
             condoms, spermicides) to prevent pregnancy or practicing abstinence or where partner&#xD;

             become pregnant or to impregnate, sperm donation, in vitro fertilization), and if&#xD;
             participating in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy, the female subject/male&#xD;
             partner must use condoms (male or female) in addition to one of the following forms of&#xD;

    <ipd_description>Sharing of data generated by this project is an essential part of our proposed activities and will be carried out to comply with the NIH policy on Sharing Research Data. We wish to make our results available both to the community of scientists interested in HIV infection, immune activation and co-morbidities, as well as to people living with HIV infection. The data generated in this project will be presented at local, national and international conferences and published in peer-reviewed journals in a timely fashion. All final peer-reviewed manuscripts that arise from this project will be submitted to PubMed Central. The PI will work to facilitate any request made for data produced under this proposal upon publication of data, using standard, university-approved material/data transfer agreements.</ipd_description>
