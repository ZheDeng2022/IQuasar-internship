  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Compartment syndrome remains a very serious complication of lower extremity trauma and/or&#xD;
      procedural cases that involved lower or upper extremity surgery. This condition results in&#xD;
      muscle death, chronic pain, infection, and possible amputation. Early diagnosis is essential&#xD;
      to institute interventions to avoid complications. Unfortunately, the subjective pain of the&#xD;
      patient remains the mainstay for diagnosis. A method or device is needed that would improve&#xD;
      the investigator's ability to diagnose this potentially devastating condition. The purpose of&#xD;
      this trial is to evaluate the safety and functionality of MY01, an investigational device&#xD;
      that allows continuous monitoring of intracompartmental muscle pressure in patients at risk&#xD;
      for developing acute compartment syndrome. This is a single centre, non-randomized,&#xD;
      non-controlled, unblinded, prospective trial of the MY01 device. A cohort of 25 participants&#xD;
      will be prospectively enrolled to document the performance of the device.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical ease with which the MY01 device is able to be inserted into a compartment.</measure>
    <time_frame>24-48 hours following device insertion.</time_frame>
    <description>At device insertion, the physician will complete a feedback questionnaire, and routine assessment will be performed in compliance with the standard of care. As part of the feedback questionnaire, the physician will be asked to indicate on a sliding scale &quot;How certain are you that the sensor is in the correction position?&quot; [1 = uncertain] - [5 = very certain].&#xD;
The scale, administered part of a Clinical Report Form (CRF) titled 'Physician Survey', measures the physicians subjective level of certainty that the device sensor was inserted correctly within a patients muscle compartment. A record of 5 should be considered a positive scenario, whereas a record of 1 should indicate a negative scenario.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Ability to monitor in real time the continuous pressure readout from the compartment in remote locations via smartphone.</measure>
    <time_frame>24-48 hours following device insertion.</time_frame>
    <description>At insertion of device the physician will complete a feedback questionnaire on the device, the participant will be assessed for adverse events, and routine assessment will be performed.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The change in intracompartmental pressure.</measure>
    <time_frame>24-48 hours following device insertion.</time_frame>
    <description>Routine assessments will be completed by healthcare personnel as per standard of care (the 6P's [Pain, Paraesthesia, Pallor, Paralysis, Pulselessness, Poikilothermia]), and compared against the pressure readout [mmHG] indicated by MY01's MicroElectroMechanical (MEMS) pressure sensor inserted at the afflicted location.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adverse events associated with the use of the device.</measure>
    <time_frame>24-48 hours following device insertion, and again during the final follow-up of the participant approximately two weeks after treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>The patient will be monitored for adverse events during treatment, and will be reassessed during the final follow-up of the participant at the first return visit to the fracture clinic. An adverse event constitutes &quot;Any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or injury, or untoward clinical signs (including abnormal lab findings) in participants, users or other persons, whether or not related to the investigational device.&quot;</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain at insertion site.</measure>
    <time_frame>24-48 hours following device insertion.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked to keep a diary while the device is in situ. The diary will consist of a pain Visual Analog Score (VAS) to be completed each time their vitals are taken, with space to freely comment on the device. VAS will be on a sliding scale where [0=no pain] and [10=pain as bad as it can be].</description>
