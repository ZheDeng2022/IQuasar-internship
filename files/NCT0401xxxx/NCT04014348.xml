      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart disease is a leading cause of death in the United States. Healthy diet and exercise&#xD;
      improve heart health. Some features of where a person lives can lead to stress and decrease&#xD;
      chances for exercise. Researchers want to see how these factors may increase the risk of&#xD;
      heart disease in women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if there are differences in stress levels between women who live in different parts of&#xD;
      Washington, DC. Also, to see how these women use their neighborhoods for exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy white or black females ages 19-45 who live in Washington, DC, wards 3 or 5 and have&#xD;
      access to a smartphone&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will stay at the NIH Clinical Center overnight for a 2-day visit. Tests will&#xD;
      include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electrocardiogram: Electrodes on the participant s skin will measure heart activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PET/CT scan: Participants will get an injection. They will lie in a machine that takes&#xD;
      pictures of the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surveys&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body size measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood vessel tests: This is measured with blood pressure cuffs, a device placed on the&#xD;
      participant s fingertip, and a probe placed on the participant s neck.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resting Energy Expenditure: Participants will breathe under a clear hood for 45 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be followed for about 2 weeks. They will wear a device on the wrist and&#xD;
      carry a GPS device. Through a mobile app, they will answer short daily surveys on stress and&#xD;
      exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will then have a follow-up visit. They will have blood tests and take surveys.&#xD;

      Innovative analyses of cardiovascular (CV) risk markers and heath behaviors in relation to&#xD;
      neighborhood stressors are needed to further elucidate mechanisms by which adverse&#xD;
      neighborhood conditions lead to poor CV outcomes. We propose to objectively measure physical&#xD;
      activity, sedentary behavior, and neighborhood stress through accelerometers, global&#xD;
      positioning systems (GPS), and ecological momentary assessment survey (via smartphone&#xD;
      survey), linked to biological measures in a sample of White and African American women in&#xD;
      Washington, D.C. neighborhoods. We hypothesize that individuals who are living in worse&#xD;
      neighborhood environment conditions (e.g., higher poverty, crime, and social disorder) will&#xD;
      be associated with higher chronic stress-related neural activity. As a secondary hypothesis,&#xD;
      we hypothesize that associations between living in socio-economically disadvantaged&#xD;
      neighborhood conditions and adverse biological markers will be moderated/mediated through&#xD;
      levels of physical activity, time spent on sedentary activities, and dietary intake.&#xD;
      Relationships between living in socio-economically disadvantaged neighborhood conditions and&#xD;
      adverse biological markers will be also be mediated through psychosocial factors. In Aim 1,&#xD;
      we will test associations between neighborhood environment conditions (e.g., poverty, crime,&#xD;
      social disorder) and differences in stress-related neural activity, using PET CT-measured&#xD;
      amygdala FDG uptake among a sample of White and African American women in Ward 3 (higher&#xD;
      socio-economic status neighborhood) and Ward 5 (low-to-middle socio-economic status&#xD;
      neighborhood) in Washington D.C. In Aim 2a, we will determine associations between&#xD;
      neighborhood environment conditions (e.g., poverty, crime, social disorder) and differences&#xD;
      in cardiovascular risk and immune activation. Several measures of cardiovascular risk and&#xD;
      immune activation will be performed including: (i) assessment of vascular function (vascular&#xD;
      stiffness, vascular inflammation) and (ii) measures of immune function (i.e. flow cytometry&#xD;
      for immune cell phenotyping, cytokine/chemokine/cortisol/neurotransmitter profiling,&#xD;
      lipidomic analyses for lipid inflammatory intermediates, PBMC telomere length). In Aim 2b, we&#xD;
      will assess feasibility and practicality of the use of geospatial tools and methods for&#xD;
      measuring environmental factors (i.e. poverty, crime, social disorder) among this sample of&#xD;
      women in Washington, DC. In aim 2c, we will examine whether associations between worse&#xD;
      neighborhood environment conditions and adverse biological markers may be moderated and/or&#xD;
      mediated by health behaviors (i.e., physical activity, sedentary time, dietary intake) and&#xD;
      psychosocial factors (i.e., mood) measured via ecological momentary assessment (EMA). This&#xD;
      project has a strong potential for improving scientific understanding of how neighborhood&#xD;
      stress may influence biological measures of stress-related neural activity, such as amygdala&#xD;
      activity, to improve our knowledge on interrelations among biology, environment, and&#xD;
      cardiovascular health.&#xD;

        The proposed study will be cross-sectional with a sample of healthy White females (n=30)&#xD;
        and females of African descent Americans (n=30) from Wards 3 and 5 in Washington, DC.&#xD;
        Participants will be asked to wear a GPS unit and accelerometer, and to use a smartphone&#xD;
        (i.e., to measure perceived stress/mood via EMA) to examine associations between&#xD;
        GIS-derived neighborhood variables, stress-related neural activity measures, and adverse&#xD;
        biological markers. A sample of the women (n=30) will be recruited from high income areas&#xD;
        in Ward 3. They will be recruited from census tracts within 5% range for median household&#xD;
        income of Ward 3. The other participants (n=30) will be recruited from low income areas in&#xD;
        Wards 5. They will also be recruited from census tracts within 5% range for median&#xD;
        household income of Ward 5.&#xD;
