      Evaluate feasibility, safety, and preliminary estimates of resistance training (RT) efficacy&#xD;
      to promote lean body mass accrual in patients with CD aged 14-18. This will be achieved by&#xD;
      conducting a parallel 2-arm randomized-controlled pilot trial of RT compared to usual care.&#xD;
      At weeks 0 (pre-treatment), 6 (mid-treatment), and 12 (post- treatment), feedback regarding&#xD;
      safety, feasibility, and acceptability will be collected from participants through surveys&#xD;
      and interviews. Magnitude of the effect size of the intervention on LBM, muscle strength, and&#xD;
      health-related quality of life (HRQoL) will also be estimated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lean body mass (LBM) deficits are common in Crohn's Disease (CD) and persist beyond&#xD;
      achievement of remission. In a recent review of 21 studies with a total of 1,479 youth with&#xD;
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), 93.6% of patients with CD showed deficits in LBM compared&#xD;
      to healthy controls. LBM deficits in CD are multifactorial though largely explained by&#xD;
      malnutrition. Even with weight restoration and remission however, youth with CD continue to&#xD;
      show deficits in LBM compared to healthy peers. Despite proportional deficits in fat and LBM&#xD;
      at baseline, weight restoration is explained by gains in fat without similar gains in LBM,&#xD;
      suggesting that additional mechanisms interact to maintain deficits such as low physical&#xD;
      activity (PA) or altered energy partitioning. Chronic LBM deficits can have deleterious&#xD;
      effects including decreased physical function, myopenia, metabolic dysregulation, increased&#xD;
      risk of infection, compromised peak bone mass accrual, and development of&#xD;
      osteopenia/osteoporosis. While some factors are not readily modifiable (e.g. underlying&#xD;
      disease mechanisms), targeting factors amenable to change may result in an increase in LBM&#xD;
      and thus improved health outcomes. Health behaviors, including exercise, are modifiable and&#xD;
      associated with the development of LBM. Resistance training (RT) has been associated with&#xD;
      improved LBM in youth with and without chronic illness. To our knowledge, no evidence-based&#xD;
      resistance training interventions have been developed to promote LBM accrual in pediatric CD.&#xD;
      The overarching aims of this proposal are to evaluate the safety, feasibility, and effects of&#xD;
      12 weeks of RT on LBM in youth with CD aged 14-18. Specifically we aim to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Evaluate feasibility, safety, and preliminary estimates of RT efficacy to promote LBM&#xD;
      accrual in patients with CD aged 14-18. This will be achieved by conducting a parallel 2-arm&#xD;
      randomized-controlled pilot trial of RT compared to usual care. At weeks 0 (pre-treatment), 6&#xD;
      (mid-treatment), and 12 (post- treatment), feedback regarding safety, feasibility, and&#xD;
      acceptability will be collected from participants through surveys and interviews. Magnitude&#xD;
      of the effect size of the intervention on LBM, muscle strength, and health-related quality of&#xD;
      life (HRQoL) will also be estimated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Positive findings would have broad implications for growth and long-term health outcomes&#xD;
      including bone disease and metabolic health in these young patients. More broadly, the&#xD;
      findings would have promising potential to be extended to patients with IBD across the&#xD;
      developmental and disease spectrum including youth with ulcerative colitis (UC) and adults&#xD;
      with IBD as they demonstrate similar LBM deficits. The proposed study will also provide&#xD;
      preliminary data to inform a evaluation through a larger trial.&#xD;
