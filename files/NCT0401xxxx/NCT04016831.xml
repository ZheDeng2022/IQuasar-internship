      Despite demonstrated effectiveness, evidence based practices are not widely incorporated into&#xD;
      existing residential and outpatient treatments. For implementation (and sustainment) of&#xD;
      effective practices to be successful, it is critical that agencies be able to independently&#xD;
      assess their own strengths and weaknesses and develop plans for organizational improvement.&#xD;
      This application will extend scientific and field knowledge by providing a low-cost and&#xD;
      sustainable alternative for improving agency preparedness for change.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      For implementation (and sustainment) of new interventions to be successful, it is critical&#xD;
      that barriers are identified and addressed prior to change. It is challenging, however, for&#xD;
      agencies to independently assess their own strengths and weaknesses and to develop plans for&#xD;
      organizational improvement. Furthermore, the sheer number of strategies to promote&#xD;
      implementation makes it difficult for agency leadership to decipher which are most&#xD;
      appropriate for their own contexts and needs. This application proposes to develop and pilot&#xD;
      test Mapping Approaches to Prepare for Implementation Transfer (MAP-IT), an organizational&#xD;
      intervention that includes four key elements: (1) guidelines on forming an implementation&#xD;
      workgroup to inform and promote implementation efforts, (2) instruction on mechanisms known&#xD;
      to impact implementation, (3) tools and instruction for conducting an agency-driven diagnosis&#xD;
      of potential implementation barriers, and (4) tools for developing an implementation&#xD;
      blueprint to address identified barriers (including instruction on strategies for addressing&#xD;
      potential barriers prior to implementation). The premise of this application is significant&#xD;
      in that MAP-IT would provide a low-cost (agency-driven opportunity for deliberate&#xD;
      implementation preparedness, without ongoing external coaching) and sustainable (skill&#xD;
      development for multiple individuals within the organization that can be applied to future&#xD;
      implementation efforts) alternative to promoting organizational adoption of new practices.&#xD;
      The specific aims of the proposed research are as follows: Aim 1 - Synergistically integrate&#xD;
      and adapt three established implementation intervention tools to promote deliberate agency&#xD;
      implementation preparation - organizational assessment and feedback; taxonomy of&#xD;
      implementation strategies; and visual-spatial decision making techniques - as combined into a&#xD;
      comprehensive training and manualized bundle, MAP-IT. AIM 2 - Conduct a 2-arm cluster&#xD;
      randomized efficacy trial of the MAP-IT intervention with 12 substance abuse treatment&#xD;
      community-based residential and juvenile justice secure agencies serving adolescents&#xD;
      (including those with opioid use disorders) randomized to either MAP-IT (EBP and MAP-IT&#xD;
      trainings) or the non-intervention control condition (EBP training only). Successful&#xD;
      completion of the aims is expected to (1) establish preliminary evidence for the efficacy of&#xD;
      a low-cost, sustainable alternative for improving implementation preparation that agencies&#xD;
      can use to support and expedite implementation transfer, (2) shift the current paradigm by&#xD;
      encouraging researchers (designing uptake studies) and health care agencies (independently&#xD;
      striving to implement new practices) to place greater emphasis on pre-implementation&#xD;
      preparations for change, (3) provide an empirical examination of how exploration and&#xD;
      preparation can support implementation, using established measurement platforms and&#xD;
      theoretical frameworks, and (4) provide documentation of agency selection of implementation&#xD;
      strategies for promoting change in real-world settings. Findings from the proposed R21 will&#xD;
      inform intervention effectiveness testing and implementation strategy selection in a future&#xD;
      R01 aimed at improving uptake of best practices within behavioral healthcare delivery&#xD;
      services using a full-scale randomized control trial.&#xD;
