  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anlotinib is a novel oral multitarget tyrosine kinase inhibitor and primary targeted to&#xD;
      VEGFR, FGFR, PDGFR and c-Kit. The ALTER-0303 trial showed that patients with advanced&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who received anlotinib as third-line or further therapy&#xD;
      had more survival benefit. Pemetrexed plus platinum-based chemotherapy (AP) was long&#xD;
      considered as the first line treatment in non-squamous NSCLC patients with negative driver&#xD;
      mutation. In this dose exploration study, the primary objective is to establish the safety&#xD;
      profile of anlotinib combined with AP in non-squamous NSCLC patients by identifying dose&#xD;
      limiting toxicity (DLT), maximum tolerance dose (MTD), the recommended phase II dose, and&#xD;
      schedule. Secondary objective includes the assessment of preliminary antitumor effect.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anlotinib, a new small molecule inhibitor of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases targeting the&#xD;
      vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), fibroblast growth factor receptor&#xD;
      (FGFR), platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) and c-Kit,8,9 has been approved as a&#xD;
      third-line treatment for refractory advanced NSCLC by the China Food and Drug Administration&#xD;
      (CFDA) on May 9, 2018.10 Previous study in phase II (ALTER0302) trial has shown a better&#xD;
      progression-free survival (PFS) in advanced NSCLC patients treated with anlotinib compared&#xD;
      those with the placebo (4.8 vs 1.2 months, P&lt;0.0001).11 In phase III (ALTER0303) trial, both&#xD;
      the overall survival (OS) and PFS of advanced NSCLC patients were observed to be&#xD;
      significantly longer in the anlotinib group (median, 9.6 and 5.4 months) than the placebo&#xD;
      group (median, 6.3 and 1.4 months).12 Moreover, anlotinib also displayed manageable toxicity,&#xD;
      long circulation, and broad-spectrum antitumor potential.13,14 For the lack of recommended&#xD;
      drugs with exactly therapeutic effect in the third-line treatment of SCC patients, it is&#xD;
      worth to further analyze the efficacy and specifically clinical observation indicator of&#xD;
      anlotinib in this subtype of NSCLC patients. In this dose exploration study, the primary&#xD;
      objective is to establish the safety profile of anlotinib combined with AP in treatment-naive&#xD;
      non-squamous NSCLC patients by identifying dose limiting toxicity (DLT), maximum tolerance&#xD;
      dose (MTD), the recommended phase II dose, and schedule. Secondary objective includes the&#xD;
      assessment of preliminary antitumor effect.&#xD;
