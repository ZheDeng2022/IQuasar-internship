  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Clostridioides (formerly Clostridium) difficile Infection (CDI) is a persistent&#xD;
      healthcare issue. In the US, CDI is the most common infectious cause of hospital-onset (HO)&#xD;
      diarrhea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: Assess the impact of admission testing for toxigenic C. difficile colonization on&#xD;
      the incidence of clinical disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Pragmatic stepped-wedge Infection Control initiative. Setting: NorthShore University&#xD;
      HealthSystem (NorthShore) is a four-hospital system near Chicago, Illinois.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients: All patients admitted to the four hospitals during the initiative. Interventions:&#xD;
      From September 2017 through August 2018 the investigators conducted a quality improvement&#xD;
      program where admitted patients had a peri-rectal swab tested for toxigenic C. difficile. All&#xD;
      colonized patients were placed in contact precautions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements: The investigators tested admissions who: i) had been hospitalized within two&#xD;
      months, ii) had a past C. difficile positive test, and/or iii) were in a long-term care&#xD;
      facility within six months. The investigators measured compliance with all other measures to&#xD;
      reduce the incidence of HO-CDI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Limitations: This was not a randomized controlled trial, and multiple prevention&#xD;
      interventions were in place at the time of the admission surveillance initiative.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) remains a constant, even increasing, clinical infection&#xD;
      threat in the United States and Europe. New preventive strategies are urgently needed.&#xD;
      Current control measures do not target asymptomatic carriers, despite evidence that they can&#xD;
      contaminate the hospital environment and health care workers' hands; a risk to potentially&#xD;
      transmit C. difficile to other patients. Of special importance is that not only is disease&#xD;
      prevalence increasing, but severity of illness and mortality also is on the rise. The&#xD;
      investigators have implemented many interventions at our healthcare system including bleach&#xD;
      cleaning of rooms with CDI patients, monitoring of environmental services' room cleaning,&#xD;
      hand hygiene education and even UV light disinfection of rooms harboring CDI patients, and&#xD;
      none have been consistently effective. The investigators believe that CDI is much like&#xD;
      methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), in that many more patients are colonized&#xD;
      than infected, and one (perhaps the optimal) way to curtail disease is to interrupt&#xD;
      transmission by identifying carriers and placing them into contact (glove and gown)&#xD;
      precautions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to test this hypothesis with a quality improvement program study at&#xD;
      NorthShore. The primary goal is to demonstrate that surveillance testing for C. difficile&#xD;
      colonization at the time of admission and contact precaution isolation of those positive will&#xD;
      reduce spread of the organism as well as lower clinical CDI. The investigators secondary&#xD;
      goals are to demonstrate a reduction in C. difficile infection incidence after implementation&#xD;
      of this program and demonstrate that such a program is cost effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have collected CDI disease rates for 10 years. One of our hospitals admits a high number&#xD;
      of patients from long term care facilities (LTCFs) and currently has a rate of infection at&#xD;
      11 cases/10,000 patient days, and this facility served as a pilot site in the program&#xD;
      initiative. The nosocomial CDI rate at this facility had been rising during the first quarter&#xD;
      of 2016. The investigators plan to introduce peri-rectal (intra-anal) swab testing for C.&#xD;
      difficile on all admissions accompanied by isolation of positive patients, which the&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize will lower the rate to 3 cases/10,000 patient days. In absolute&#xD;
      numbers, the goal is to reduce the rate from 4 nosocomial cases per month down to 1&#xD;
      nosocomial case per month. This is intended to provide a sample size that can demonstrate a&#xD;
      level of significance at p&lt;.05 for disease reduction with the intervention when compared to&#xD;
      the same time frame prior to the admission testing intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the proposed pilot admission screening program is successful, the investigators will show&#xD;
      disease is reduced by implementing the admission screening program. At that point, if a&#xD;
      successful outcome is achieved, the program will be extended to all 4 hospitals in the&#xD;
      NorthShore system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, the investigators will be collecting a double headed swab (Culturette) on all&#xD;
      patients, so those testing positive will have the second swab cultured for C. difficile. The&#xD;
      purpose of this is to validate the Roche C. Diff Cobas test as a valid screen testing&#xD;
      platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Period:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All admissions giving verbal consent to the target pilot hospital will be tested, and the&#xD;
      program will continue until at least 2,000 patients have taken part. The admitting nurses or&#xD;
      patient care technicians (PCTs) will collect the peri-rectal swab sample specimen. This&#xD;
      initial program began on July 1, 2016. The expected primary completion date for the pilot&#xD;
      program was December 31, 2016. The complete observation period for the full 4-hospital&#xD;
      initiative ended December 31, 2018.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testing Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients admitted to the target hospital will have a peri-rectal swab collected at the time&#xD;
      of admission. This will be tested by the Roche cobas C. Diff assay. The investigators will be&#xD;
      testing 6 days per week at the central hospital (Evanston Hospital).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Benefit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A report from Canada (using the BD assay) indicates the concept should work (reference 10&#xD;
      below) - the investigators believe the outcome will be better than or equal to the result of&#xD;
      this publication since isolation will include gowns as well as gloves. The investigators will&#xD;
      be the first US study to show admission testing works to provide a significant reduction in&#xD;
      healthcare-onset C. difficile infection (HO-CDI) and save patient lives.&#xD;
