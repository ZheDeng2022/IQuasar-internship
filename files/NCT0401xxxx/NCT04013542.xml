    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects of ipilimumab and nivolumab in combination with&#xD;
      radiation therapy, and to see how well they work in treating patients with stage II-III&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as ipilimumab and&#xD;
      nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the&#xD;
      ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Radiation therapy uses high energy rays to kill&#xD;
      tumor cells and shrink tumors. Ipilimumab and nivolumab may also help radiation therapy work&#xD;
      better by making tumor cells more sensitive to the radiation therapy. Giving ipilimumab and&#xD;
      nivolumab in combination with radiation therapy may work better in treating patients with&#xD;
      stage II-III non-small cell lung cancer compared to standard chemotherapy in combination with&#xD;
      radiation therapy.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine safety and feasibility of ipilimumab-nivolumab (Bristol-Meyers-Squibb,&#xD;
      Opdivo), a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA4) and programmed death 1 (PD-1)&#xD;
      inhibitor in the treatment of local-regionally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the clinical outcomes of treatment with ipilimumab-nivolumab concurrent with&#xD;
      radiation therapy in patients with local-regionally advanced NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. III. To identify potential predictive and&#xD;
      prognostic biomarkers for early recurrence using circulating cell-free deoxyribonucleic acid&#xD;
      (DNA) (cfDNA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To identify potential predictive and prognostic biomarkers for early recurrence using&#xD;
      tumor tissue PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To identify potential predictive and prognostic biomarkers for early recurrence using&#xD;
      tumor tissue tumor mutational burden (TMB).&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To identify potential resistance mechanisms using immune biomarker and genetic analysis&#xD;
      in post-progression biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Tumor tissue/blood biomarkers will be assessed for tumor mutation burden (TMB) and PD-L1&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Patient microbiomes will be evaluated with stool specimen collection kits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONCURRENT THERAPY: Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1&#xD;
      and ipilimumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment with nivolumab repeats every 21 days&#xD;
      for up to 8 cycles, and treatment with ipilimumab repeats every 42 days for up to 4 cycles in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Within 1 day of starting&#xD;
      nivolumab and ipilimumab, patients also undergo radiation therapy 5 days a week&#xD;
      (Monday-Friday) over 6-7 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Patients then receive nivolumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment&#xD;
      repeats every 28 days for up to 8 cycles in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years.&#xD;

                  be excluded) are permitted provided that they meet the following conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Patients with psoriasis must have a baseline ophthalmologic exam to rule out&#xD;

             tomography (CT) scan&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No active pregnancy. The effects of ipilimumab-nivolumab on the developing human fetus&#xD;
             are unknown. For this reason and because radiation and possibly immunotherapies used&#xD;
             in this trial are known or possibly known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing&#xD;
             potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method&#xD;
             of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study&#xD;
             participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or&#xD;
             her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician&#xD;
             immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate&#xD;
             contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 7&#xD;
             months after completion of ipilimumab-nivolumab administration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation or anaplastic&#xD;
             lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement are eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior systemic therapy for the current active local-regionally advanced NSCLC&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to nivolumab&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because nivolumab is an immunotherapy&#xD;
             agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an&#xD;
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with nivolumab, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the&#xD;
             mother is treated with nivolumab. These potential risks may also apply to radiation&#xD;
             therapy used in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positivity&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active chronic treatment (that is still required) with systemic immunosuppressive&#xD;
             medications (including but not limited to prednisone, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine,&#xD;
             methotrexate, thalidomide, and anti-tumor necrosis factor [TNF] agents)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have received acute, low dose, systemic immunosuppressant medications&#xD;
             (e.g., a one-time dose of dexamethasone for nausea) may be enrolled. The use of&#xD;
             inhaled corticosteroids and mineralocorticoids (e.g., fludrocortisone) for patients&#xD;
             with orthostatic hypotension or adrenocortical insufficiency is allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of severe allergic, anaphylactic, or other hypersensitivity reactions to&#xD;
             chimeric or humanized antibodies or fusion proteins&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with prior allogeneic bone marrow transplantation or prior solid organ&#xD;
             transplantation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active untreated hepatitis. Patients with known past or resolved hepatitis B infection&#xD;
             (defined as having a negative hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] test and a positive&#xD;
             anti-HBc [antibody to hepatitis B core antigen] antibody test) are eligible. Patients&#xD;
             positive for hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody are eligible only if polymerase chain&#xD;
             reaction (PCR) is negative for HCV RNA (ribonucleic acid). Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and&#xD;
             HCV viral loads must also be undetectable&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known active untreated tuberculosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Administration of a live, attenuated vaccine within 4 weeks before treatment start or&#xD;
             anticipation that such a live attenuated vaccine will be required during the study.&#xD;
             Influenza vaccination should be given during influenza season only (approximately&#xD;
             October to March). Patients must not receive live, attenuated influenza vaccine (e.g.,&#xD;
             FluMist) within 4 weeks prior to treatment start or at any time during the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Malignancies within 3 years prior to treatment start, with the exception of those with&#xD;
             a negligible risk of metastasis or death and with expected curative outcome (such as&#xD;
             adequately treated stage I-II cancers, carcinoma in situ of the cervix, basal or&#xD;
             squamous cell skin cancer, localized prostate cancer treated surgically with curative&#xD;
             intent, or ductal carcinoma in situ treated surgically with curative intent) or&#xD;
             undergoing active surveillance per standard-of-care management (e.g., CLL [chronic&#xD;
             lymphocytic leukemia] Rai stage 0, prostate cancer with Gleason score =&lt; 6, and&#xD;
             prostate-specific antigen [PSA] =&lt; 10 mg/mL, etc.)&#xD;
