    <textblock>
      This study will find out if trastuzumab deruxtecan is safe and works for participants with&#xD;
      certain kinds of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They must have HER2-positive gastric or gastro-esophageal junction (GEJ) cancer:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  that cannot be removed surgically&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  that has moved to other parts of the body&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  that got worse during or after treatment that included trastuzumab&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll about 80 participants. Sites will be in North America and the European&#xD;
      Union.&#xD;
