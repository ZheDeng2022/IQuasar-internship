  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-interventional cohort study evaluating non-relapse mortality and toxicities in&#xD;
      patients with CTCL or ATLL treated with mogamulizumab pre- or post- alloHCT for patients&#xD;
      transplanted beginning January 1, 2012 until accrual is complete.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational, retrospective and prospective study where subjects who have&#xD;
      received mogamulizumab either within one year before or within 18 months after&#xD;
      transplantation will be followed for data collection. Data will be collected at baseline&#xD;
      (retrospectively), 100 days post alloHCT, 6-months, 1 year and at 2 years post alloHCT&#xD;
      (retrospectively and prospectively).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cut-off time limit of 18 months post alloHCT exposure will allow at least 6 months of&#xD;
      follow-up within the 2 years post-alloHCT follow-up period.&#xD;

        The study population will include a minimum of 50 patients with CTCL or ATLL who received&#xD;
        mogamulizumab within one year prior to alloHCT. At least 40 patients should have been&#xD;
        diagnosed with CTCL and at least 33 patients should have received mogamulizumab as last&#xD;
        therapy line before alloHCT. Data will be collected from no more than 100 controls with&#xD;
        similar characteristics to the mogamulizumab-treated patients, and who have undergone&#xD;
        alloHCT without exposure to mogamulizumab pre- or post-alloHCT. Information on patients&#xD;
        receiving mogamulizumab within 18 months after alloHCT will also be collected.&#xD;
