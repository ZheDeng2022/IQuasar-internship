  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this feasibility study is to evaluate safety and effectiveness in&#xD;
      healing outcomes of patients treated with Lumina24TM BLU (treatment), a Continuous&#xD;
      Low-Irradiance Phototherapy (CLIP) device, as compared to standard of care (SOC) therapy&#xD;
      (control) for the treatment of acute burns.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This feasibility study will consist of up to 15 subjects (Cohort I: up to 10 subjects with&#xD;
      partial thickness second-degree burns; Cohort II: up to 5 subjects with deep partial&#xD;
      thickness second- and/or full thickness third-degree burns). Each subject will be randomized&#xD;
      to receive standard of care dressing on approximately half of the study burn site, and&#xD;
      Lumina24TM BLU treatment on the remaining half of the study burn site. If the subject has&#xD;
      bilaterally symmetric burns, they will be randomized to receive SOC or Lumina24TM BLU at the&#xD;
      distinct anatomical burn locations (e.g. right/left thigh, right/left shoulder, etc.). The&#xD;
      proposed feasibility study will inform critical primary and secondary outcome measures and&#xD;
      procedural improvements necessary for a pivotal clinical study that would demonstrate both&#xD;
      antimicrobial effectiveness and improved wound healing of acute burn wounds.&#xD;
