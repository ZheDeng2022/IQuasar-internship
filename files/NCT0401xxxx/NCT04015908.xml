      The primary objective of this trial is to determine whether the combination of three&#xD;
      non-opioid analgesics (multimodal analgesia) can significantly reduce or eliminate the need&#xD;
      for opioids after ambulatory surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary objective would be to present credible data for insurance providers about the&#xD;
      opioid sparing effect of these medications. This data may encourage insurance providers to&#xD;
      support payment for short term use of certain analgesics that currently require prior&#xD;
      authorization.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prescription opioids are associated with addiction and accidental overdose, yet they continue&#xD;
      to be the most commonly prescribed analgesics after ambulatory surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multimodal analgesia is a promising alternative to opioids. It is based on the theory that a&#xD;
      combination of more than one analgesic (with non-opioid mechanisms of action) can provide&#xD;
      pain relief equal to or exceeding that of traditional opioids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multimodal analgesia is not associated with opioid related side effects such as respiratory&#xD;
      depression, nausea, constipation, and itching.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementation of multi-modal analgesia in an ambulatory setting is challenging for a number&#xD;
      of reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, patient compliance with multiple medications and complex dosing schedules is poor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second, misinformation still exists about the dosing of acetaminophen and NSAIDS&#xD;
      (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs). For example, many patients and health care providers&#xD;
      believe that acetaminophen and NSAIDS cannot be taken concurrently. As a result, the additive&#xD;
      analgesic effect of combining these drugs is not achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, some medications used for multimodal analgesia can be difficult to procure in the&#xD;
      ambulatory setting. For example, pregabalin (trade name Lyrica) has been used successfully to&#xD;
      treat acute pain and reduce opioid requirements after surgery. However, its mechanism of&#xD;
      action is similar to that of gabapentin (an older and less expensive drug) and insurers are&#xD;
      reluctant to approve its use over the expensive alternative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although gabapentin is a useful analgesic for chronic pain, its delayed onset of activity and&#xD;
      unpredictable blood levels after oral administration make it impractical to use in the&#xD;
      setting of acute pain. In fact, optimal dosing of gabapentin may require several days or&#xD;
      weeks to establish.By contrast, pregabalin has a rapid onset of action with consistent and&#xD;
      predictable plasma levels after oral administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this trial, patients in the control group would receive traditional postoperative pain&#xD;
      medication consisting of a combination of oxycodone and acetaminophen (trade name Percocet)&#xD;
      as needed at 4-6 hour intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the study group would receive the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Three non-opioid pain medications (acetaminophen,celecoxib, and pregabalin) would be&#xD;
           taken concurrently at six hour intervals for a period of 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  These three non-opioid medications (acetaminophen, celecoxib, and pregabalin ) would be&#xD;
           provided in a &quot;blister pack&quot;. All scheduled pain medication for a given 6 hour interval&#xD;
           would be contained in a single compartment to simplify compliance for the patient. Study&#xD;
           patients would also have access to oxycodone as a &quot;rescue medication&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principles of postoperative pain management addressed in this protocol are supported by&#xD;
      existing literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patient compliance with complex medication dosing protocols may be improved using&#xD;
           calender and time based &quot;blister packs&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pain control using combined acetaminophen and NSAID is superior to that either drug in&#xD;
           isolation&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Pregabalin can reduce opioid requirements and opioid related nausea when treating acute&#xD;
           pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this trial is to determine whether the combination of three&#xD;
      non-opioid analgesics (multimodal analgesia) can significantly reduce or eliminate the need&#xD;
      for opioids after ambulatory surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary objective would be to present credible data for insurance providers about the&#xD;
      opioid sparing effect of these medications. This data may encourage insurance providers to&#xD;
      support payment for short term use of certain analgesics that currently require prior&#xD;
      authorization.&#xD;
