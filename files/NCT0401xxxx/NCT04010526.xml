  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autologous ADSVF constitutes an innovative therapeutic strategy that concentrates various&#xD;
      types of regenerative stem cells and paracrine factors able to promote angiogenesis and&#xD;
      tissue repair. Together with the ease of collection from a minimally manipulated&#xD;
      lipoaspirate, the unique properties of ADSVF offer new opportunities for fistulas' healing in&#xD;
      patients with CD. The use of ADSVF is currently developed in many clinical fields based on&#xD;
      safety and efficacy data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our ADICROHN pilot study evaluating safety and tolerance of local administration of&#xD;
      autologous ADSVF with microfat in CD patients with complex perianal fistula refractory to&#xD;
      conventional medical and surgical therapy showed that this novel therapeutic approach appears&#xD;
      feasible and safe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However the therapeutic potential of local this combined treatment in healing refractory&#xD;
      perianal Crohn's fistulas still remains to be demonstrated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of local injection of autologous&#xD;
      ADSVF and microfat versus placebo for the treatment of complex refractory perianal Crohn's&#xD;
      fistulas at week 24.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy will be assessed on clinical assessment of closure of all the external openings&#xD;
      that were drained at baseline, and MRI confirmation of absence of collections &gt; 2 cm of the&#xD;
      treated perianal fistulas at week 24.&#xD;
