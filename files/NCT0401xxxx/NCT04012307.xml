  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single dose study was designed in accordance with EMA (the European Medicines Agency)&#xD;
      regulatory guidelines, with the aim of characterizing the bioavailability of candesartan in&#xD;
      the two formulations in healthy subjects. As this is a bioequivalence trial where each&#xD;
      subject received each study treatment in a crossover fashion, a control group was not&#xD;
      included. Within the clinical portion of the study each subject received a single oral dose&#xD;
      of the test and the reference formulation in compliance with the generated randomization&#xD;
      code. The primary study endpoints were the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters Cmax and AUC0-t of&#xD;
      candesartan.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, randomized, 2-treatment, 2-period, 2-sequence, crossover, single&#xD;
      dose study design, in which 40 healthy adult subjects received one of the study treatments&#xD;
      during each study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study was to determine the bioequivalence of two different formulations&#xD;
      of candesartan after a single oral dose administration under fasting conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intra-subject variation following a single dose of candesartan cilexetil appeared to be&#xD;
      around 28.8% for Cmax and around 24% for AUC0-t. Statistically, given that the expected Test&#xD;
      to Reference ratio of geometric least-squares means (LSmeans) should fall within 95 and 105%,&#xD;
      it is estimated that the lowest number of subjects to meet the 80 to 125% bioequivalence&#xD;
      range with a statistical a priori power of at least 80% is about 36. Therefore, the inclusion&#xD;
      of 40 subjects should be sufficient to account for the possibility of drop-outs, variations&#xD;
      around the estimated intra-subject coefficient of variation (CV) and to conclude in favor of&#xD;
      the hypothesis of bioequivalence with sufficient statistical power.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject eligibility for this study will be determined at the screening visit and eligible&#xD;
      subjects will be admitted to the clinical research unit at least 10 hours prior to drug&#xD;
      administration for each study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subject who withdraws or is withdrawn during the pretrial evaluations but before receiving&#xD;
      the first dose (the test or the reference product) in Period 1 will not be considered as a&#xD;
      drop-out and will not be included in the final database. Standbys should be recruited and&#xD;
      available to replace any subject who withdraws prior to the first drug administration.&#xD;
      On-study drop-outs will not be replaced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Altasciences will generate the randomization code with a computer program according to the&#xD;
      study design, the number of subjects and the sequence of treatment administration. The random&#xD;
      allocation of each sequence of treatment administration to each subject will be done in such&#xD;
      a way that the study is balanced. Once generated, the randomization code will be final and&#xD;
      will not be modified. Eligible subjects will be randomized to one of two treatment sequences.&#xD;
      There will be two sequences in the study: AB and BA, where A = the test product, B = the&#xD;
      reference product (see detailed description of A and B items in Section &quot;Arms and&#xD;
      Interventions&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each study period, subjects will receive a single 32 mg oral dose of candesartan&#xD;
      cilexetil (the test or the reference formulation). Study participants will be aware they will&#xD;
      receive different formulations of the same drug, without being informed which product (Test&#xD;
      or Reference) is being administered.The date and time of each dose will be recorded. For each&#xD;
      subject, all scheduled postdose activities and assessments will be performed relative to the&#xD;
      time of study drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fasting will continue for at least 4 hours following drug administration, after which a&#xD;
      standardized lunch will be served. A supper and a light snack will be served at appropriate&#xD;
      times thereafter, but not before 9 hours after dosing. Water will be provided as needed until&#xD;
      1 hour predose. Water will be allowed beginning 1 hour after the administration of the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 21 blood samples will be collected (one tube of 3 mL each) in each study period&#xD;
      for pharmacokinetic (PK) assessments.The first blood sample will be collected prior to drug&#xD;
      administration while the others will be collected up to 48 hours after drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given that the parent compound, candesartan cilexetil, is rapidly and completely converted to&#xD;
      the pharmacologically active metabolite, candesartan, candesartan cilexetil cannot be&#xD;
      reliably measured. Therefore, the analyte to be measured in the present study will be&#xD;
      candesartan. Candesartan plasma concentrations will be measured according to a validated&#xD;
      bioanalytical method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects are to be discharged from the clinic after the 24-hour following drug&#xD;
      administration. However, they may be advised to stay at the clinical site for safety reasons,&#xD;
      if judged necessary by the physician in charge. Subjects will return to the clinical site for&#xD;
      each of the 2 remaining blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected terminal elimination half-life observed after a single oral 32 mg dose of&#xD;
      candesartan cilexetil tablets under fasting conditions is 11.6 hours. To avoid any carry-over&#xD;
      effect, a wash-out of 7 calendar days is planned between drug administrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The decision of which subjects will be included in the PK analysis is to be documented by the&#xD;
      pharmacokineticist (or delegate) and approved by the sponsor before the start of the sample&#xD;
      analysis by the bioanalytical facility. Subjects who are expected to provide evaluable PK&#xD;
      data for both the Test and Reference products (based on viable PK samples) will be included&#xD;
      in the PK analysis. Concentration data of the remaining subjects will be presented&#xD;
      separately. Subjects who do not complete the sampling schedule of one or more study periods&#xD;
      may be included in the PK and statistical analysis and bioequivalence determination for only&#xD;
      the PK parameters that are judged not to be affected by the missing sample(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis of Tmax will be based on a non-parametric approach. Statistical analysis&#xD;
      of all other PK parameters will be based on an ANOVA model. Two-sided 90% confidence interval&#xD;
      of the ratio of geometric LSmeans obtained from the ln-transformed PK parameters will be&#xD;
      calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical inference of candesartan will be based on a bioequivalence approach using the&#xD;
      following standards: the ratio of geometric LSmeans with corresponding 90% confidence&#xD;
      interval calculated from the exponential of the difference between the Test and the Reference&#xD;
      for the ln-transformed parameters Cmax and AUC0-t should all be within the 80.00 to 125.00%&#xD;
      bioequivalence range.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety population will include all subjects who received at least one dose of one of the&#xD;
      IPs. Safety assessments will include vital signs, clinical laboratory tests and AE&#xD;
      monitoring. Additional safety measurements may be performed at the discretion of the&#xD;
      investigator for reasons related to subject safety.The physician in charge will be present at&#xD;
      the clinical site for at least the first 4 hours following each drug administration and will&#xD;
      remain available at all times throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total study duration: up to 38 days (including screening).&#xD;
