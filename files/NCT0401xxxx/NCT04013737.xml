  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antimicrobials (drugs that kill or stop the growth of microorganisms including bacteria,&#xD;
      thereby treating infections) commonly used to treat patients with infections are becoming&#xD;
      less effective over time as bacteria develop resistance to them. Antimicrobial usage itself&#xD;
      can lead to development and spread of antimicrobial resistance. Antimicrobial resistance is&#xD;
      now a major threat to patient safety. To conserve the effectiveness of antimicrobials the&#xD;
      investigator need to develop ways to use them more sensibly healthcare professionals who&#xD;
      diagnose and treat infections must be able to access antimicrobial guidelines and test&#xD;
      results at the patient bedside. This needs to be provided rapidly and with support to make&#xD;
      sure that the decisions on prescribing antimicrobials are the best that can be made.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prototype software to achieve this has been developed through collaboration between&#xD;
      healthcare professionals and biomedical engineers. This prototype software (run on a mobile&#xD;
      device) retrieves patient results from various laboratory and clinical databases (securely&#xD;
      within the Trust firewall) and displays this to the clinician making the prescribing&#xD;
      decision. Furthermore a machine learning algorithm is applied to the data, and similar&#xD;
      anonymised historical cases (and the antimicrobials prescribed and the clinical outcomes) are&#xD;
      also displayed to the clinician to further inform their decision making. The prototype has&#xD;
      been designed for use in intensive care, where the risk of infection is high, but through the&#xD;
      research project detailed here, the software will be developed and validated across other&#xD;
      areas of hospital patient care. Furthermore there is a key need to engage patients with how&#xD;
      decisions are made around antimicrobial prescribing. The investigator propose to adapt the&#xD;
      prototype to meet these needs. This system should improve patient safety and help preserve&#xD;
      the effectiveness of existing antimicrobials&#xD;

        Patients may be asked to participate in the evaluation of the the patient module.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For prescriber recruitment to use the application the following methods of identifying&#xD;
        participants will be undertaken:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Phase 1: Participants will be identified based on their roles within the infectious disease&#xD;
        team (level and areas of the hospital covered) and will be directly approached by the study&#xD;
        PI / clinical infection lead to request their support with this phase of the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Phase 2: Participants (physicians) will be identified based on the wards that they work in.&#xD;

        <description>This was assessment was a single time point at baseline (Pre-intervention) and single time point after use of the device in the study.&#xD;
Scores were pre-determined based on anticipated answers provided by participants pre- and post- intervention using a bespoke mark scheme (https://aricjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13756-018-0333-1).&#xD;
Participants could score between 0 (lowest) and 13 (highest) marks based on their responses to questions assessing knowledge and understanding.</description>
