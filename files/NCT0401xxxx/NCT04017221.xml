    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the risk of serious adverse events associated with&#xD;
      the use of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in comparison with the use of&#xD;
      dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors among patients with type 2 diabetes. More&#xD;
      specifically, the investigators will assess the risk of severe urinary tract infection&#xD;
      (urosepsis), diabetic ketoacidosis and lower extremity amputation. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that the use of SGLT2 inhibitors will be associated with an increased risk of&#xD;
      serious adverse events in comparison with the use of DPP-4 inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will carry out separate population-based cohort studies using health care&#xD;
      databases in seven Canadian provinces and the United Kingdom. Separate study cohorts will be&#xD;
      created for each of the three safety outcomes. The study cohorts will be defined by the&#xD;
      initiation of a SGLT2 inhibitor or a DPP-4 inhibitor after SGLT2 inhibitors entered the&#xD;
      market. Patients will be followed up until the occurrence of an adverse event. The results&#xD;
      from the separate sites will be combined by meta-analysis to provide an overall assessment of&#xD;
      the risk of serious adverse events in users of SGLT2 inhibitors in comparison to users of&#xD;
      DPP-4 inhibitors.&#xD;

      The objective of this study is to compare the risk of serious adverse events associated with&#xD;
      the use of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in comparison with the use of&#xD;
      dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors among patients with type 2 diabetes. More&#xD;
      specifically, the investigators will assess the risk of severe urinary tract infection&#xD;
      (urosepsis), diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and lower extremity amputation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A common-protocol approach will be used to conduct retrospective cohort studies using&#xD;
      administrative health care data from seven Canadian provinces (Alberta, British Columbia,&#xD;
      Manitoba, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Quebec, and Saskatchewan) and the United Kingdom (UK)&#xD;
      Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). Briefly, the Canadian databases include&#xD;
      population-level data on physician billing, diagnoses and procedures from hospital discharge&#xD;
      abstracts, and dispensations for prescription drugs. The data in Ontario will be restricted&#xD;
      to patients aged 65 years old and older. The CPRD is a clinical database that is&#xD;
      representative of the UK population and contains the records for patients seen at over 680&#xD;
      general practitioner practices in the UK; these data will be linked to the Hospital Episode&#xD;
      Statistics (HES) database, which contains in-hospital diagnosis and procedure data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each jurisdiction, the investigators will assemble a source population that includes all&#xD;
      patients who received an antidiabetic medication (metformin, sulfonylureas,&#xD;
      thiazolidinediones, DPP-4 inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibitors, GLP-1 receptor agonists,&#xD;
      alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, meglitinides, insulin, or combinations of these drugs) between&#xD;
      January 1, 2006 and June 30, 2018 (or the latest date of data availability at each site).&#xD;
      From this source population, a study-specific cohort including all new users of SGLT2&#xD;
      inhibitors or DPP-4 inhibitors between January 1, 2013 and June 30, 2018 (or latest date of&#xD;
      data availability at each site) will be created for each safety outcome. Specific exclusion&#xD;
      criteria will be applied for each study cohort. Study cohort entry date will be defined by&#xD;
      the dispensation date (or prescription for CPRD) of the newly prescribed SGLT2 or DPP-4&#xD;
      inhibitor. Patients will be followed until the occurrence of an event (defined below), death,&#xD;
      end of health care coverage, or end of the study period, whichever occurs first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exposure will be defined using a time-varying exposure definition in which each person-day of&#xD;
      follow-up will be classified into one of the following three mutually-exclusive categories:&#xD;
      current use of SGLT2 inhibitors, current use of DPP-4 inhibitors, or other treatment&#xD;
      combinations. For all categories, exposed person-time will be defined by the prescription&#xD;
      duration plus a 30-day grace period. DPP-4 inhibitors will serve as the reference category as&#xD;
      both classes are second- to third-line therapy. The outcome of interests include urosepsis,&#xD;
      DKA and lower extremity amputation. In the urosepsis specific-study, Fournier's gangrene will&#xD;
      be assessed in descriptive analyses as a secondary outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses will be conducted separately for each study-specific cohort.&#xD;
      Site-specific rates and corresponding corresponding 95% confidential intervals (CI) of each&#xD;
      safety outcomes will be estimated using the Poisson distribution. Time-dependent Cox&#xD;
      proportional hazards models with follow-up time as the underlying time axis will be used to&#xD;
      estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HR) and corresponding 95% CI of the association between&#xD;
      current use of SGLT2 and DPP-4 inhibitor use and urosepsis, DKA, and lower extremity&#xD;
      amputation. As secondary analyses, each safety outcome will be stratified by age (â‰¥70 and &lt;70&#xD;
      years), sex and SGLT2 molecule. Sensitivity analyses will be performed to assess the&#xD;
      robustness of study results and address some of the study limitations. Site-specific results&#xD;
      will be combined by random-effects meta-analysis to provide an overall assessment of the risk&#xD;
      of serious adverse events in users of SGLT2 inhibitors in comparison to users of DPP-4&#xD;
      inhibitors.&#xD;
