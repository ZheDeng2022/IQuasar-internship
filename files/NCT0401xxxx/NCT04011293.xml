      CNCT19 in adult patients with r/r B cell Malignancies. The study will have the following&#xD;
      sequential phases: Screening, Pre-Treatment (Cell Product Preparation &amp; Lymphodepleting&#xD;
      Chemotherapy), Treatment and Follow-up, and Survival Follow-up. The total duration of the&#xD;
