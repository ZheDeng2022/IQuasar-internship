  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Opioid addiction, also referred to as opioid use disorder, among young people is a growing&#xD;
      health concern for patients and their families. Overdose deaths related to opioids have been&#xD;
      steadily increasing in number and are at an all-time high. Opioid addiction has serious&#xD;
      consequences such as getting HIV, legal problems, relationship problems, and unemployment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there are two standard of care office-based medications available to treat opioid&#xD;
      use disorder, buprenorphine and naltrexone. Naltrexone has been available for several years&#xD;
      as an extended-release monthly injectable formulation, and more recently buprenorphine is as&#xD;
      well. Both of these medications are typically administered in the medical office setting.&#xD;
      Long-acting injection medications like these help people that may otherwise forget doses,&#xD;
      skip doses, and relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAT that are FDA-approved such as these paired with counseling can help sustain recovery, but&#xD;
      retention to treatment is a concern, especially among young adults. Many barriers arise for&#xD;
      attending office-based treatment (e.g., transportation) often resulting in falling away from&#xD;
      treatment and relapsing. Involvement of family members is often challenged by health care&#xD;
      provider concerns about patient privacy, and existing relationship strain between patients&#xD;
      and their families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Youth Opioid Recovery Support (YORS) treatment delivery model hopes to address barriers&#xD;
      to retention to substance treatment among those with opioid use disorder who have already&#xD;
      decided to get treatment with either extended-release naltrexone or extended-release&#xD;
      buprenorphine. The YORS model involves: 1) home-delivery of standard-of-care medication and&#xD;
      individual/family counseling services; 2) assertive outreach efforts by the treatment team;&#xD;
      and 3) contingency management incentives upon receipt of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This service model has already shown promise in addressing barriers to treatment retention&#xD;
      particularly difficulties with medication adherence in patients who were prescribed monthly&#xD;
      injectable extended-release naltrexone. Now that extended-release buprenorphine is also&#xD;
      available, broader MAT options provided in an assertive service delivery model may maximize&#xD;
      treatment retention and recovery outcomes. Further, transitioning participants from&#xD;
      home-based receipt of treatment to clinic-based care begins the translation to sustainable&#xD;
      health care.&#xD;
