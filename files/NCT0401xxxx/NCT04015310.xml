    <textblock>
      This is a health economic study on using quantitative magnetic resonance imaging in biliary&#xD;
      disease. It is an observational study aiming to recruit 40 patients with Primary Sclerosing&#xD;
      Cholangitis (PSC) in 12 months. The aim of the study is to assess the effect of result of&#xD;
      enhanced Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography (MRCP+) on the physicians' diagnosis&#xD;
      and/or plans for patients with suspected or confirmed PSC, compared with usual standard of&#xD;
      care. This study also aims to identify the cost-effectiveness of adding MRCP+ to the standard&#xD;
      care pathway.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is the greatest unmet need in modern liver medicine.&#xD;
      There continue to be no direct bio-markers for the diagnosis and monitoring of biliary&#xD;
      diseases such as PSC, constituting a major barrier to drug development and to poor patient&#xD;
      outcomes. This project aims to validate an imaging platform, enhanced Magnetic Resonance&#xD;
      Cholangiopancreatography, MRCP+, to improve the standard of care for patients by generating&#xD;
      the real-world evidence needed to support clinical adoption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biliary diseases significantly increase the likelihood of developing sclerosing cholangitis&#xD;
      (SC), causing major morbidity and mortality. Sclerosing cholangitis, a chronic inflammatory&#xD;
      cholestatic condition, is exemplified by the primary idiopathic autoimmune condition PSC. In&#xD;
      the absence of effective therapies, hindered by a lack of measurable trial endpoints&#xD;
      (bio-markers), liver transplantation is the only life-extending intervention, with PSC&#xD;
      accounting for 15% of all European liver transplantations. Furthermore, biliary complications&#xD;
      occur in 5-32% of all liver transplantations. MRCP+ has the potential to significantly&#xD;
      improve the outlook for patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, diagnosis requires cholangiopancreatography, either magnetic resonance (MRCP) or&#xD;
      endoscopic retrograde (ERCP). The current standard ERCP is expensive, invasive, and&#xD;
      associated with a high risk of morbidity. MRCP is less invasive and cheaper. However, both&#xD;
      result in inconsistent qualitative interpretations. MRCP+ is the first device to enable&#xD;
      direct quantitative measurement of biliary disease and addresses both European and US Liver&#xD;
      society (EASL and AASLD) concerns that early changes of PSC are missed by MRCP, necessitating&#xD;
      adequate visualisation and quantitative assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRCP+ both enhances MRCP images and yields advanced quantitative biliary measures. Initial&#xD;
      experience shows significant clinical potential. This project will provide substantive&#xD;
      evidence for clinical adoption via a real-world study including heath economics to evaluate&#xD;
      the cost-effectiveness and impact on the clinical care pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve this, 40 patients were recruited from the University Hospitals Birmingham (UHB)&#xD;
      who are attending the centre for either a review or diagnosis of PSC. The patients will&#xD;
      follow their usual care pathway, being seen by the consultant who will document their care&#xD;
      plan. Following this appointment, and their consent, they will be asked to undergo a&#xD;
      non-invasive, pain-free Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan. MRCP+ reports generated from&#xD;
      these scans will be returned to the consultant who will review the documented standard care&#xD;
      treatment plan and ascertain whether any amendments would have been made in light of these&#xD;
      further quantitative metrics gained from MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study team alongside the Oxford Academic Health Science Network (OAHSN), will use the&#xD;
      clinical data generated by the 40 patients and create a health economic model, which can be&#xD;
      used to generate a business case for adoption, an impact case study for dissemination across&#xD;
      the network of 15 centres in the Academic Health Science Networks (AHSN) and contribute to a&#xD;
      submission for Human Tissue Authority (HTA) as part of the evidence required to gain health&#xD;
      technology adoption via the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Medical&#xD;
      Technologies Evaluation Programme (MTEP) route.&#xD;
