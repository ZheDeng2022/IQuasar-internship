  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atherosclerosis is a disease of the arteries and is the result of various factors such as&#xD;
      high blood cholesterol or diabetes, which lead to accumulations of fats, cells, and calcium&#xD;
      deposits (i.e. plaques). It has been shown that people with a rapid increase in the amount of&#xD;
      calcium deposits have a higher risk for stroke and heart attack than people with a decreased&#xD;
      amount.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous scientific research has shown that a protein called Matrix Gla Protein plays an&#xD;
      important role in the prevention of calcification. This protein works well only if there is&#xD;
      enough Vitamin K in the blood vessels. In a large human studies, it has been shown that&#xD;
      especially MK-7 (a form of Vitamin K2) is best absorbed by blood vessels. Moreover, studies&#xD;
      suggest positive effects of vitamin D (especially D3) on vitamin K-dependent metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the last years, fluorine-18 sodium fluoride (18F-NaF) positron emission tomography (PET)&#xD;
      emerged as a reliable clinical imaging tool able to detect micro-calcification in the blood&#xD;
      vessels. Therefore, the present study will use 18F-NaF PET in combination with magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI) to assess the influence of vitamin K and D supplementation in the&#xD;
      development of arterial micro-calcification in the context of atherosclerosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study would like to confirm that MK-7 and vitamin D3 supplementation induces a&#xD;
      significant reduction in the degree of micro-calcification from carotid artery disease&#xD;
      patients, when comparing to a placebo, after 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a prospective double blind randomised controlled feasibility study, in which one&#xD;
      group will receive a MK-7 and vitamin D3 supplementation compared to a control group&#xD;
      receiving a placebo.&#xD;

    <description>The primary outcome of this study is the mean rate of the change in time of vascular micro-calcification in the carotid arteries, measured as a difference between the intervention group and placebo group in (18)F-NaF uptake via hybrid PET/MRI after the 3 months of treatment.</description>

The Agatston coronary artery calcification score isis a semi-automated tool to calculate a score based on the extent of coronary artery calcification detected by an non-contrast low-dose CT scan. The score ranges from 0 arbitrary units to &gt; 400. The higher the value of the score, the higher the degree of calcification is in the coronary arteries; hence, lower values usually represent a better outcome.</description>
