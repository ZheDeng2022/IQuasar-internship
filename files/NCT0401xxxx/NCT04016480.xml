  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The execution of diagnostic-therapeutic investigations by bronchial endoscopy can expose the&#xD;
      patient to acute respiratory failure (ARF). In particular, the risk of hypoxemia is greater&#xD;
      during broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL). For this reason, oxygen therapy is administered at low&#xD;
      or high flows during the course of bronchoscopic procedures, in order to avoid hypoxemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Few clinical studies have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of high flow oxygen through&#xD;
      nasal cannula (HFNC) during BAL procedures, and no study has evaluated, during bronchial&#xD;
      endoscopy, the effects of HFNC on diaphragmatic effort (assessed with ultrasound) and&#xD;
      aeration and ventilation of the different lung regions (assessed with electrical impedance&#xD;
      tomography).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, investigators conceived the present randomized controlled study to evaluate&#xD;
      possible differences existing during bronchoscopy between oxygen therapy administered with&#xD;
      HFNC and conventional (low-flow) oxygen therapy, delivered through nasal cannula.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with Acute Respiratory Failure may sometimes require a bronchial endoscopy for&#xD;
      broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the procedure, hypoxemia may worsen and oxygen may be require to avoid desaturation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the recent years, High-Flow through Nasal Cannula (HFNC) has been introduced in the&#xD;
      clinical practice. HFNC delivers to the patient heated humidified air-oxygen mixture, with an&#xD;
      inspiratory fraction of oxygen (FiO2) ranging from 21 to 100% and a flow up to 60 L/min&#xD;
      through a large bore nasal cannula.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HFNC has some potential advantages. First of all, HFNC provides heated (37Â°C) and humidified&#xD;
      (44 mg/L) air-oxygen admixture to the patient, which avoids injuries to ciliary motion,&#xD;
      reduces the inflammatory responses associated to dry and cold gases, epithelial cell cilia&#xD;
      damage, and airway water loss, and keeps unmodified the water content of the bronchial&#xD;
      secretions. Second, HFNC determines a wash out from carbon dioxide of the pharyngeal dead&#xD;
      space. Third, HFNC generates small amount (up to 8 cmH2O) of pharyngeal pressure during&#xD;
      expiration, which drops to zero during inspiration. Fourth, HFNC guarantees a more stable&#xD;
      FiO2, as compared to conventional oxygen therapy. Whenever the inspiratory peak flow of a&#xD;
      patient exceeds the flow provided by a Venturi mask, the patient inhaled also part of&#xD;
      atmospheric air.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a noninvasive imaging technique providing&#xD;
      instantaneous monitoring of variations in overall lung volume and regional distribution of&#xD;
      ventilation, as determined by variations over time in intrathoracic impedance, which is&#xD;
      increased by air and reduced by fluids and cells. EIT allows determining changes in&#xD;
      end-expiratory lung impedance (EELI), a surrogate estimate of end-expiratory lung volume,&#xD;
      assessing global and regional distribution of Vt, and obtaining indexes of spatial&#xD;
      distribution of ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diaphragm ultrasound is a bedside, radiation free technique to assess the contractility of&#xD;
      the diaphragm and the respiratory effort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study investigators aim to evaluate possible differences existing during bronchoscopy&#xD;
      between oxygen therapy administered with HFNC and conventional (low-flow) oxygen therapy,&#xD;
      delivered through nasal cannula in terms of respiratory effort (as assessed through diaphragm&#xD;
      ultrasound), lung aeration and ventilation distribution (as assessed with EIT) and arterial&#xD;
      blood gases.&#xD;
