      Hypothesis 1: On fMRI scanning, frontoparietal activation during performance of executive&#xD;
      function tasks of working memory, inhibitory control processes, and stimulus-response&#xD;
      interference will exhibit greater signal intensity, a wider spatial extent, and more&#xD;
      bilateral activation in chronic MTBI than chronic OI participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: DTI changes, characterized by lower FA and higher MD at the gray-white&#xD;
      junction, corpus callosum, central semiovale, and internal capsule, will be seen in MTBI but&#xD;
      not in OI subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3: Increased fMRI activation in chronic MTBI will be correlated with location and&#xD;
      severity of disrupted fiber tracks that subserve neural networks associated with each fMRI&#xD;
      activation task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 4: Performance on computerized neuropsychological testing (ANAM) and reaction time&#xD;
      measures on fMRI tasks will better discriminate MTBI from OI than standard paper-and pencil&#xD;
      tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 5: The combination of fMRI, DTI, and ANAM will better discriminate MTBI from OI&#xD;
      than each individual method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 6: More severe brain pathology in MTBI, as measured by neuroimaging (fMRI, DTI)&#xD;
      and ANAM test scores, will be associated with less severe PTSD and symptoms.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Traumatic brain injuries (TBI) are a common occurrence from roadside blasts of improvised&#xD;
      explosive devices (IEDs). Like civilian TBI, blast-related TBI can result from mechanical&#xD;
      forces in which objects in motion strike the head or the head is forcefully put into motion&#xD;
      and strikes an object. TBI from exposure to an explosive blast may also result from a third&#xD;
      cause: barotrauma. Blasts produce wave-induced changes in atmospheric pressure, which in turn&#xD;
      produce characteristic injuries to vulnerable bodily regions at air-fluid interfaces, such as&#xD;
      the middle ear. It is unknown whether the neural and cognitive sequelae of blast-related TBI&#xD;
      differ from those resulting from mechanically-induced TBI commonly observed in civilian&#xD;
      accidents. Understanding the potentially unique sequelae of blast-related TBI is critical for&#xD;
      accurate diagnosis and designing effective pharamacological and neurorehabilitation&#xD;
      interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the proposed cross-sectional study, we aim to apply neurobehavioral testing and advanced&#xD;
      MRI techniques [task-activated functional MRI (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)] to&#xD;
      gain a comprehensive understanding of the neural changes underlying blast-related MTBI. This&#xD;
      will be accomplished by comparing neurobehavioral and neuroimaging findings obtained from&#xD;
      military personnel who have experienced a blast injury with those obtained from civilians who&#xD;
      have experienced TBI from motor vehicle accidents and from military and civilian control&#xD;
      participants with orthopedic injuries. We will accomplish this goal by conducting advanced&#xD;
      neuroimaging (task-activated fMRI and DTI fiber tracking) and neurobehavioral testing&#xD;
      (computerized assessment and standard neuropsychological testing) on 120 chronic trauma&#xD;
      patients: 30 military MTBI patients who have experienced blast injuries, 30 civilian MTBI&#xD;
      patients with mechanical closed head injuries, and 30 military and 30 civilian patients with&#xD;
      orthopedic injuries.&#xD;
