  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psychotherapy is one of the cornerstones in public and private mental health services.&#xD;
      Despite the tremendous investment in psychotherapy, its efficiency ranges from 40% to 60%.&#xD;
      Given the Mental health Reform (2015), aimed at increasing the quality, availability, and&#xD;
      accessibility of mental health services, there is an urgent need to manage and maximize&#xD;
      psychotherapy services in Israel.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Objectives: To examine the feasibility of implementing managing (monitor and interventional)&#xD;
      procedures in psychotherapy services conducted in public mental health services, to assess&#xD;
      their effect on the outcome, and to estimate their impact on the 2015 Mental Health Reform&#xD;
      objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Working hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After appropriate preparation, managed psychotherapeutic service will be implemented in&#xD;
           4 public mental health out-patients clinics;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Managed psychotherapeutic service will lead to an improvement in the outcome of&#xD;
           psychotherapy;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Managed psychotherapeutic service will increase the efficacy of mental health services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type of study: A multicenter, randomized, controlled study with a group comparison and a&#xD;
      program trial, in which the subjects are recruited according to a systematic allocation by&#xD;
      order.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since in the field of psychotherapy, &quot;measure means affect,&quot; there is a built-in difficulty&#xD;
      in building control groups (which are also committed to evaluation). For this reason, the&#xD;
      proposed study combines a control group comparison.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research population: The study will be carried out in the therapeutic settings of two&#xD;
      psychiatric hospitals: the Shalvata Mental Health Center and the Geha Mental Health Center.&#xD;
      The study population will include patients receiving therapeutic services in the ambulatory&#xD;
      system of these centers (three clinics, the Shalvata Mental Health Center, one clinic, the&#xD;
      Geha Mental Health Center). The study population includes patients with all the common mental&#xD;
      disorders (adjustment disorders, anxiety, depression, personality disorders and somatomorphic&#xD;
      disorders). The allocation between caregivers will be random in order, in a one-to-one ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research groups: The proposed study has two groups. Both groups include patients who are&#xD;
      actively receiving psychotherapy on a weekly basis for at least three months to neutralize&#xD;
      the effects of starting treatment. The first group will be under the usual treatment&#xD;
      conditions (TAU); The second group will be exposed to a multidisciplinary therapeutic program&#xD;
      that has a monitoring component and after two months an intervening component will be. In&#xD;
      order to reduce the effect of the treated variables and the analysis of nested data, each&#xD;
      therapist will introduce two patients into the study: one patient will be in the normal&#xD;
      treatment condition (TAU) and the other under the monitoring and intervention program. In&#xD;
      order to ensure randomization in this allocation, the clinic manager will determine the&#xD;
      identity of the patients (i.e., each therapist will recruit two patients, and the allocation&#xD;
      decision will be made anonymously by the clinic manager).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: Included are patients over the age of 18 years who have agreed to&#xD;
      participate in the study, were found suitable for psychotherapeutic treatment and are treated&#xD;
      with the attending clinician for at least two months. Patients who (due to cognitive&#xD;
      impairment, language gaps, etc.) are not able to complete questionnaires with little help&#xD;
      will not be included in the study. In order to minimize the effect of external variables,&#xD;
      patients who, in the opinion of the clinician, are expected to undergo significant&#xD;
      pharmacological changes (change in non-sleeping drugs or occasional sedatives) will not be&#xD;
      inclusesd Population of caregivers: Experienced therapists from various therapeutic&#xD;
      professions (including psychologists, social workers, psychiatrists, and other therapists who&#xD;
      are graduates of psychotherapy training programs) will participate in the study. Only&#xD;
      therapist who have a proven experience of at least 6 months in the clinic and manage at least&#xD;
      four treatments at the beginning of the study will participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection: Data collection will be carried out through computerized information systems&#xD;
      (computerized medical records, by an application on a cellular device currently being&#xD;
      developed as part of the project).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research tools and variables: The primary outcome measure of the study is the OQ-45 (Lambert,&#xD;
      M. J., Gregersen, A.T., Burlingame, G.M. (2004). The Outcome Questionnaire-45 The use of&#xD;
      psychological testing for treatment planning and outcomes assessment: Volume 3: Instruments&#xD;
      for adults (3rd ed) (pp. 191-234). Mahwah, NJ, US: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates Publishers).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods of data analysis: Differences between groups will be examined using chi-squared tests&#xD;
      (in categorical variables) or by independent T-tests and Mann-Whitney tests (non-categorical&#xD;
      variables). Time differences will be analyzed by ANCOVA (repeated measures) and TSA (time&#xD;
      series analysis). The sample size estimation is 68 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importance: Managed psychotherapeutic service has the potential to improve the clinical&#xD;
      outcomes, and to increase the efficiency of the mental health services following the goals of&#xD;
      the 2015 Mental Health Reform.&#xD;
