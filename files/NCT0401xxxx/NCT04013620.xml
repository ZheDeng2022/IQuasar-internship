    <textblock>
      Calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) remain the standard treatment in renal transplantation to&#xD;
      prevent rejection. Currently the main limitation of kidney transplantation is the occurrence&#xD;
      of chronic graft dysfunction due to the CNI nephrotoxicity. Thus, strategies to minimize or&#xD;
      stop CNI have been developed as belatacept, a fusion protein (CTLA4-Ig) blocking the ligand&#xD;
      of the main CD28 costimulatory molecule. In the original phase III trial, used de novo in&#xD;
      combination with MMF (without CNI) belatacept allowed to obtain a better renal function as&#xD;
      soon as 1 year and a better graft and patient survival after 7 years. Despite these excellent&#xD;
      results, belatacept has not become the gold standard due to a higher incidence of early&#xD;
      rejection. In addition, belatacept is not covered by the french social security policy,&#xD;
      because benefits are considered insufficient with respect to the cost. Patients with poor&#xD;
      early graft function are a preferred indication of belatacept. It is then used instead of CNI&#xD;
      at 3 months post-transplant allowing to improve kidney function without over-risk of&#xD;
      rejection. Currently after conversion, belatacept is maintained indefinitely due to the&#xD;
      supposed CNI chronic nephrotoxicity. However this one is more and more questionable. Thus,&#xD;
      the investigators assume that in patients with poor function at 3 months posttransplantation&#xD;
      the belatacept's benefit could be obtained by a transient replacement of CNI by belatacept&#xD;
      from 3 to 12 months post-transplantation. It is the feasibility of this strategy and its&#xD;
      medico-economic impact that the investigators wish to study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The standard maintenance regimen in renal transplantation combines calcineurin inhibitor&#xD;
      (CNI: ciclosporin or tacrolimus) and anti-metabolite drugs (mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) or&#xD;
      mycophenolic acid (MPA)). CNI in the 1980s made kidney transplantation possible by&#xD;
      drastically reducing acute rejection rates in the first year. Currently the main limitation&#xD;
      of kidney transplantation is the occurrence of chronic graft dysfunction. While half of&#xD;
      patients die with a functional graft, the other half return to dialysis and require&#xD;
      retransplantation. Paradoxically, CNI has been identified as a leading cause of chronic graft&#xD;
      dysfunction. Indeed, these molecules are nephrotoxic both : acutely and transitory due to a&#xD;
      vasoconstrictor effect that modulates intra-renal hemodynamic and chronically due to&#xD;
      extensive fibrosis. In the late 1990s, with the development of a new class of&#xD;
      immunosuppressants, mammilian target of rapamycin (mTor) inhibitors (sirolimus and&#xD;
      everolimus), CNI-free protocols were developed. The results were disappointing due in part to&#xD;
      the undesirable effects of these treatments and secondly to the occurence of chronic&#xD;
      rejections related to the appearance of Donor Specific Antibody (DSA) antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally in the mid-2000s belatacept is a fusion protein (CTLA4-Ig) blocking the ligands of&#xD;
      the main costimulatory molecule (CD28) emerged. In the Phase III princeps assay (BENEFIT),&#xD;
      this molecule was used as a maintenance treatment following transplantation (de novo) in&#xD;
      combination with MMF (without CNI). Compared to the control group with CNI, patients&#xD;
      receiving belatacept had better renal function from 1 year and after 7 years survival (graft&#xD;
      and patient) were better. These benefits were attributed, on the one hand, to the absence of&#xD;
      CNI and, on the other hand, to a very good control of the alloimmune response demonstrated by&#xD;
      a lower incidence of DSA in the belatacept group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite these excellent results, belatacept has not become the gold standard in renal&#xD;
      transplantation for two main reasons. First, when it is used de novo (as in BENEFIT), there&#xD;
      is a significant incidence of early rejection, known as &quot;costimulation blockade resistant&quot;.&#xD;
      The second issue is medico-economic. Indeed, to date and despite the accumulation of&#xD;
      favorable data, in France and in most countries, belatacept has marketing authorization but&#xD;
      is not supported by social security policy due to benefits regarded as insufficient with&#xD;
      respect to the cost (related to the IV administration requiring hospital environment every&#xD;
      month).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consequently, it is important to precise which recipients may benefit more from this&#xD;
      molecule. Patients, often elderly, with poor early function of the graft due to the poor&#xD;
      quality of a marginal / &quot;extended criteria&quot; donor, are a good indication of belatacept not&#xD;
      used de novo but after 3 months instead of CNI. This conversion most often allows to&#xD;
      significantly improve the renal function of these patients to a much more acceptable level&#xD;
      which remains stable beyond and without cost in terms of rejection (probably because of the&#xD;
      time interval with the transplant). In this situation, several series reported success rates&#xD;
      ranging from 80 to 100% with a rejection incidence between 0 and 20%. Failures are most often&#xD;
      due to patients with non-primary graft function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently after the conversion, belatacept is always maintained indefinitely most often in&#xD;
      association with MMF. This usage generates significant costs and in fact, limits the access&#xD;
      of belatacept for other patients. This practice is based on the dominant idea that chronic&#xD;
      nephrotoxicity of CNI is the cause of chronic graft dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, while reversible acute toxicity, mediated by hemodynamic changes in intra-renal&#xD;
      vascularization, is undeniable, the importance and even the reality of chronic, cumulative,&#xD;
      irreversible CNI toxicity has been questioned during the last decade, while the importance of&#xD;
      chronic anti-donor antibody (DSA) rejection to explain chronic graft dysfunction was&#xD;
      demonstrated. The chronic toxicity of CNI is probable when high doses are necessary to&#xD;
      prevent rejection during the first year but uncertain beyond.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the investigators assume that in patients with poor graft function at 3 months&#xD;
      post-transplantation most of the benefit of belatacept could be obtained by a transient&#xD;
      replacement of CNI from 3 to 12 months post-transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indeed, in these often elderly patients, who have most often received an &quot;extended criteria&quot;&#xD;
      graft (derived from a marginal donor), presenting chronic lesions, CNI-induced intra-renal&#xD;
      vasoconstriction could more easily evolve to irreversible lesions in the context of&#xD;
      ischemia-reperfusion inherent in the graft itself. At 1 year after transplantation the&#xD;
      reintroduction of CNIs at minimized doses could only moderately alter the renal function&#xD;
      allowing to maintain them at long term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of this transient treatment&#xD;
      strategy (from 3 to 12 months post transplantation) in patients with poor function at 3&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From 3 months post-transplantation, patients will receive for 9 months (phase 1) a treatment&#xD;
      with belatacept allowing to stop CNI. Then CNI will be reintroduced (phase 2) with a&#xD;
      follow-up period of 6 months which will make it possible to judge the feasibility of this&#xD;
      strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Belatacept is the only biotherapy introduced successfully in transplantation. But this&#xD;
      treatment, because of the limitations raised, has not yet found a definite place. Our project&#xD;
      is to study a practical question: can the investigators stop belatacept after having&#xD;
      introduced it early in the context of an early dysfunction while preserving the benefits. The&#xD;
      decisive contribution of this study would be to prove the concept of a transient treatment by&#xD;
      belatacept which has not been reported. The medico-economic consequences would be major, the&#xD;
      cost of a long-term treatment by belatacept, especially because of its administration in&#xD;
      hospital, being much higher than that of a conventional treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary objective is to measure by flow cytometry the evolution of the absolute and&#xD;
      relative amount of regulatory T lymphocytes. Indeed, the negative effect of belatacept on&#xD;
      this essential lymphocyte population remains very controversial.&#xD;
