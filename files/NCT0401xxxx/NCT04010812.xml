  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study's purpose is to determine if a patient's perception of readiness for discharge from&#xD;
      sub-acute rehabilitation, as measured by Readiness For Hospital Discharge Scale Patient&#xD;
      Self-Reports Form, correlates with the patient's success after discharge, measured by patient&#xD;
      reported number of falls, emergency room visits and hospitalizations 30 days post discharge.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All sub-acute rehabilitation patients will be approached for study participation one day&#xD;
      prior to discharge day from the facility. Patients will be approached in their private room&#xD;
      within the facility to obtain consent. Consent will be reviewed with patient by&#xD;
      investigators. Patients will be asked to demonstrate understanding of the study and what&#xD;
      consent will imply utilizing the teach back method. If patient is able to demonstrate&#xD;
      understanding and gives consent the MoCA will be administered. If MoCA scores falls between&#xD;
      22-30 they will be included in study. If MoCA score falls below 22 they will not be included&#xD;
      in study and that will be explained to them at that time. MoCA scores will be included in&#xD;
      patient medical record. Patient name and assigned ID number, phone number, second contact and&#xD;
      consent will be recorded on the confidential roster sheet and stored in a locked file cabinet&#xD;
      located in director's office at Peconic Landing. The day of discharge patients will complete&#xD;
      the RHDS survey. Investigators will complete the study data sheet including ID number, MoCA&#xD;
      score, RHDS score, length of stay, discharge date, and recommended discharge therapy- home&#xD;
      care, outpatient, none. Thirty to thirty-seven days after discharge investigators will call&#xD;
      patient and ask 3 questions from scripted form. &quot;How many falls have you had since discharge&#xD;
      home:, &quot;How many visits to the emergency room have you had since your discharge home&quot;,&quot;How&#xD;
      many admissions to the hospital have you had since your discharge home.&quot; Following completion&#xD;
      of telephone questions, confidential roster sheet and consent form will be shredded.&#xD;
