  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, open-label, single-arm CE-Mark trial to assess device&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of the Cordella PA Sensor System in up to 75 New York Heart Association&#xD;
      (NYHA) Class III Heart Failure patients who will receive the Cordella PA Sensor Implant.&#xD;

      The study objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To establish that the Cordella PA Sensor can be safely delivered, deployed, and remain&#xD;
           stable within the target pulmonary artery (PA) segment through 30 days post-implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare Cordella PA Sensor System pressure measurements with fluid-filled catheter PA&#xD;
           pressure measurements obtained by standard right heart catheterization (RHC) at 90 days&#xD;
           post implant.&#xD;
