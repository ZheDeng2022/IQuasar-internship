  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Increase in intracranial pressure (ICP) could be associated with increase in positive&#xD;
      end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) level. Data are however disparate and interactions between&#xD;
      ventilation with high PEEP and intracranial circulation are still debated. Individual&#xD;
      patient's chest wall elastance could have a key role in determining the effects of PEEP on&#xD;
      ICP, since it dictates which proportion of the applied PEEP is transmitted to the pleural&#xD;
      space, thus increasing central venous pressure (CVP) and reducing cerebral venous return.&#xD;
      Measurement of esophageal pressure with a dedicated probe allows partitioning of respiratory&#xD;
      system elastance into its lung and chest wall components, thus permitting to study this&#xD;
      phenomenon. Multimodal intracranial monitoring permits to study the effects of PEEP on more&#xD;
      advanced brain-specific indices such as brain tissue oxygen (PtiO2), cerebral microdialysis&#xD;
      data, transcranial doppler ultrasound-derived flow measurements and automated pupillometry,&#xD;
      besides ICP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to test the association between the ratio of chest wall to respiratory system&#xD;
      elastance and PEEP-induced variations in ICP and brain-specific multimodal monitoring&#xD;
      indices. This study will evaluate the relative role of other selected measures of respiratory&#xD;
      mechanics, hemodynamic variables and intracranial compliance, in order to establish the role&#xD;
      of individual respiratory mechanics in the interplay of physiological factors affecting the&#xD;
      effects of positive pressure ventilation on the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo two periods of ventilation at two different levels of PEEP (5 and 15&#xD;
      cmH2O) in a randomized cross-over order. At the end of each period, cardiorespiratory&#xD;
      clinical data, ICP and other advanced multimodal neuromonitoring data (brain tissue oxygen&#xD;
      tension, cerebral microdyalisis analytes, transcranial doppler ultrasound and automated&#xD;
      infrared pupillometry data) will be collected. Systematic respiratory mechanics assessment&#xD;
      (including calculation of chest wall and lung elastances and estimation of the amount of&#xD;
      recruitment versus overdistension due to PEEP by means of a single-breath derecruitment&#xD;
      trial), echocardiography and arterial blood gas analysis will be performed.&#xD;
