  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Minimally invasive cardiac surgery is performed through a right thoracotomy, the pain&#xD;
      management of this surgery is of great importance. Regional techniques such as thoracic&#xD;
      epidural anesthesia or paravertebral block are excellent techniques for the management of&#xD;
      postoperative pain in thoracic surgery but they have disadvantages that make it difficult to&#xD;
      use in this surgery. On the one hand, anticoagulation in these patients increases the risk of&#xD;
      complications related to the use of neuraxial techniques and, on the other hand, the&#xD;
      technical difficulty of paravertebral block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The erector of the spine block is a technically simple block and with a low risk of&#xD;
      associated complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the feasibility and benefits in the relationship of&#xD;
      postoperative pain management in patients undergoing minimally invasive cardiac surgery when&#xD;
      using continuous unilateral blockade of the erector in a small cohort of patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An observational study of a series of 20 cases will be carried out based on the casuistry of&#xD;
      minimally invasive cardiac surgery of the investigator's center. The performance of analgesic&#xD;
      blockade called ESP with catheter placement for continuous analgesia, at the level of the 6th&#xD;
      thoracic vertebra in adult patients, ASA physical status I-III, which will undergo minimally&#xD;
      invasive cardiac surgery, will be part of the multimodal analgesia strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After compliance with the inclusion criteria, with the acceptance and signature of the&#xD;
      informed consent by the participating patients, the following procedure will be followed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients will be routinely assessed by an anesthesiologist of the service, later they&#xD;
           will enter the operating room, where the vital signs will be monitored and the usual&#xD;
           anesthetic technique will be used for minimally invasive cardiac surgery, that is,&#xD;
           general anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The erector block of the spine and the catheter installation for continuous analgesia&#xD;
           will be performed in the operating room, after induction of general anesthesia. Patients&#xD;
           will be placed in the left lateral decubitus position, and under sterile technique with&#xD;
           asepsis of the thoracolumbar area, erector spine block and catheter placement will be&#xD;
           performed for continuous analgesia prior to the surgical procedure. The spinal erector&#xD;
           musculature will be located at the level of the transverse process of the 6th left&#xD;
           thoracic vertebra.Initially a volume of 20 ml of Levobupivacaine 0.25% will be&#xD;
           administered. Subsequently a 22G (Gauge) catheter will be introduced and fixed 10-12 cm&#xD;
           from the skin. The surgery will begin according to the usual practice. At the end of the&#xD;
           surgery, an elastomeric pump will be installed at a flow rate of 7 ml / hr with a 1.3%&#xD;
           Ropivacaine solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. During and after the surgery, the intravenous analgesic protocols already established by&#xD;
           the anesthesiology service will be used, so that the realization of the blocking in the&#xD;
           plane of the erector musculature will not modify the prescribed analgesic or rescue&#xD;
           regimens employees for minimally invasive cardiac surgery, these include the use of an&#xD;
           opioid pump on demand by the patient. After the surgery, the intensity of postoperative&#xD;
           pain during the first 48 hours will be observed and recorded by the Acute Pain Unit of&#xD;
           the Anaesthesiology Service, blind to the study objectives, following its usual practice&#xD;
           and assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Researchers will record those variables aimed at evaluating the intensity of acute&#xD;
           postoperative pain after minimally invasive cardiac surgery after performing spinal&#xD;
           erector block and catheter placement for continuous analgesia in the study period, such&#xD;
           as NRS (Numeric rating scale), Paired intravenous analgesia and opioid use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These results will be included, anonymously, in an Excel database made for this purpose for&#xD;
      further analysis. The variables will be recorded in a single intervention&#xD;
