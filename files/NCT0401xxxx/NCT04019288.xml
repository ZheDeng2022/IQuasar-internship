      This trial studies the side effects and best dose of AVB-S6-500 when given together with&#xD;
      durvalumab in treating patients with ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer&#xD;
      that is resistant to platinum therapy or has come back. Immunotherapy with AVB-S6-500 and&#xD;
      durvalumab, may induce changes in body's immune system and may interfere with the ability of&#xD;
      tumor cells to grow and spread.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine toxicity profile of the combination of batiraxcept (AVB-S6-500) and&#xD;
      durvalumab therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate objective response rate to combination AVB-S6-500 and durvalumab therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To estimate the median immune-related progression free survival (irPFS) as well as&#xD;
      overall survival (OS) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 after&#xD;
      treatment with combination durvalumab and AVB-S6-500.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To investigate molecular and immunological changes associated with the combination of&#xD;
      AVB-S6-500 and durvalumab; specifically to describe changes in T cell populations (including&#xD;
      but not limited to CD3, CD8, CD4, FOXP3) and cell proliferation, as well as report changes in&#xD;
      the proportion of macrophage phenotypes M1 and M2 (with phenotypic markers potentially&#xD;
      including arginase1, CD11b, PDL-1, and CD206).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate blood and tissue based biomarkers for immune related adverse events and&#xD;
      disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To investigate impact and possible sensitization of pretreatment with AVB-S6-500&#xD;
      monotherapy on subsequent combination of durvalumab and AVB-S6-500.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate for molecular and immunologic differences between pre-treatment with single&#xD;
      agent AVB-S6-500 as compared to durvalumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation of batiraxcept, followed by a phase II study. In&#xD;
      Phase I, patients receive both batiraxcept (intravenously [IV] over 60 minutes on days 1 and&#xD;
      15) and durvalumab (IV over 60 minutes on day 1) every cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase II, patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive batiraxcept IV over 60 minutes on days 1, 15, and 29 of cycle 0, and&#xD;
      on days 1 and 15 of subsequent cycles. Beginning cycle 1, patients also receive durvalumab IV&#xD;
      over 60 minutes on day 1. Cycle 0 continues for 6 weeks and subsequent cycles repeat every 4&#xD;
      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive durvalumab IV over 60 minutes on days 1 and 22 of cycle 0 and on day&#xD;
      1 of subsequent cycles. Beginning cycle 1, patients also receive batiraxcept IV over 60&#xD;
      minutes on days 1 and 15. Cycle 0 continues for 6 weeks and subsequent cycles repeat every 4&#xD;
      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 weeks for at least 90&#xD;
      days.&#xD;
