  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-stage adaptive Phase Ib trial design, that will identify two doses (lowest dose&#xD;
      with clinical benefit and highest safe dose) in a first stage and better evaluate safety,&#xD;
      tolerability and variability of effect in the second stage.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      This is a two-stage adaptive Phase Ib trial design. It is a randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, multiple ascending dose study assessing efficacy, pharmacokinetics,&#xD;
      safety and tolerability of BXCL501 dosing in adult (18-65 years old) males and females with&#xD;
      acute agitation associated with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or schizophreniform&#xD;
      disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first stage will characterize a safe and tolerable dose range that results in a calming&#xD;
      effect as measured using the PEC total score. The lowest dose with clear clinical benefit,&#xD;
      and the highest safe and well-tolerated dose that demonstrates efficacy in a large proportion&#xD;
      of subjects will be selected over the course of testing multiple escalating dose cohorts. The&#xD;
      second stage will comprise a total of 40 subjects per dose group in a three-arm&#xD;
      placebo-controlled design in order to better characterize the broader range of safety and&#xD;
      tolerability as well as better estimate variability (effect size) which may be observed in&#xD;
      later phase placebo-controlled trials.&#xD;
