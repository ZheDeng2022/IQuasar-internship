  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of cardiometabolic risk is high among South Asians which manifests itself at&#xD;
      an early age. Studies have reported that unhealthy food choices, inadequate physical activity&#xD;
      and lack of awareness on healthy lifestyle practices pose a huge threat to the increasing&#xD;
      prevalence of metabolic abnormalities even at adolescence. In an earlier study conducted in&#xD;
      2006, reported that 68% of the children during their early adolescence had one or more of the&#xD;
      cardiometabolic abnormalities such as obesity, central adiposity, increased blood pressure&#xD;
      and presence of dysglycaemia and dyslipidaemia. The risk escalated with increasing weight.&#xD;
      Therefore, it is imperative to sensitize the children on improving their lifestyle by&#xD;
      conducting screening tests and health education programmes in schools by involving teachers.&#xD;
      The Investigator have also shown in a study that teachers can be instrumental in imparting&#xD;
      knowledge on the prevention of non-communicable diseases such as diabetes by promoting&#xD;
      healthy behavioral changes. The proposed study will focus on a) changes in the prevalence of&#xD;
      cardiometabolic risk factors over a 10 year period b) health education programme to school&#xD;
      children c) recommendations to school teachers (tool-kit) to inculcate improved lifestyle&#xD;
      practices to their students.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This programme will be conducted after obtaining prior permission from the Directorate of&#xD;
      School Education, Government of Tamil Nadu and school authorities. This study will be&#xD;
      conducted in 22 schools in Chennai involving 2815 students of age group 12 to 18 years.&#xD;
      Initially the study and its procedure will be explained to the principal and the teachers of&#xD;
      the school. Request the school authority to fix a date for each standard/grade to explain&#xD;
      about the informed consent / assent form and the study process to the students. The students&#xD;
      will be asked to give the informed consent/assent form to their parents and asked to get&#xD;
      their signature in the specified place. Instruction will be given to the students that their&#xD;
      parents can call the Investigator if they have any doubts in the informed consent/assent&#xD;
      form. After giving ample time for the informed consent process the students will be asked to&#xD;
      give the informed consent when the research team goes to the school. The informed consent&#xD;
      should be countersigned by the teachers to confirm the authenticity of the parent's&#xD;
      signature. The research team gets the signature from the student in the assent form. A date&#xD;
      is finalized with the school authority for the screening. The students are advised to come in&#xD;
      fasting for the test. On the day of screening the student will be given a screening number.&#xD;
      Necessary details such as personal and family information, anthropometry (height, weight,&#xD;
      waist circumference, body fat) and blood pressure will be measured. Medical history, diet,&#xD;
      physical activity, and sleep habits and questionnaire on awareness on diabetes will be&#xD;
      recorded. Laboratory investigations such as fasting blood glucose, plasma insulin and lipid&#xD;
      profile (Total Cholesterol, Triglyceride, Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL), Very Low-Density&#xD;
      Lipoprotein (VLDL) and High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL)) will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the assessment, the students will be given refreshments and a few minutes of rest. The&#xD;
      samples will be sent to the central laboratory for analyses. The reports will be distributed&#xD;
      to the students within a week's time. Parents will be personally contacted by the research&#xD;
      team if there is any concern in the lab report which requires medical attention.&#xD;
