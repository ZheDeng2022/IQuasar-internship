  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to improve understanding of the way transcranial magnetic&#xD;
      stimulation (TMS), a form of non-invasive brain stimulation, affects the brain. The study&#xD;
      hypothesis that when theta burst stimulation (TBS) is applied during a controlled mental&#xD;
      state, network changes will be facilitated, compared to stimulation when mental state is&#xD;
      uncontrolled. This study will focus on the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and the&#xD;
      associated frontoparietal network (FPN), which subserves cognitive control - the ability to&#xD;
      flexibly adapt and regulate behavior, an ability known to be impaired in neuropsychiatric&#xD;
      conditions such as depression and dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers that qualify for this study will have psychological assessments and&#xD;
      cognitive measures, as well as functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) scans, completed&#xD;
      after administration of TMS. Participants will be asked to come in for a total of five visits&#xD;
      that include; a screening and assessment visit; a baseline functional magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (fMRI) scan, followed by TMS session; Visits 3, 4, and 5 will be the experimental TMS&#xD;
      session, followed by fMRI scan.&#xD;

    <ipd_description>The PI will share information about this/these trial(s) via timely registration, updates, and results reporting in ClinicalTrials.gov in accordance with NIH policy.&#xD;
The PI will also upload data gathered in this proposal to an National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)-designated central data, NIMH Data Archive (NDA), as prescribed by NOT-MH-15-012, working with NIMH program to determine the timing and extent of data sharing. This includes formulation of an enrollment strategy that will obtain the information necessary to generate a Global Unique Identifier (GUID) for each participant.&#xD;
The consent form will include language indicating the intention to upload de-identified data into the central archive, and permission will be obtained from University of Michigan Institutional Review Board to do so. The budget includes a data manager to cover the costs of managing the data, building the data dictionary and harmonizing it with data structures.</ipd_description>
