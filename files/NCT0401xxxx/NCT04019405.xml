  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants aged 80 years or over, who attend Castle Hill Hospital with either stable angina&#xD;
      or an acute coronary syndrome will be invited to participate in the study. After induction&#xD;
      into the study, these participants will be assessed for frailty and quality of life (QoL)&#xD;
      using predetermined assessment tools. Quality of life (QoL) will be assessed using the&#xD;
      standardised SF-12 questionnaire proforma. Frailty assessment will be based on the use of the&#xD;
      Fried Frailty Phenotype criteria and the Edmonton Frailty Scale. Patients will be reassessed&#xD;
      at 3,9 and 24 months for their clinical outcomes, repeat frailty assessment and quality of&#xD;
      life.&#xD;

      STUDY SETTINGS: Cardiology and cardiothoracic out-patients and in-patient wards of Castle&#xD;
      Hill hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION: FRAIL-HEART is a preliminary observational study designed to&#xD;
      evaluate the practicality of undertaking frailty assessments in this population. The sample&#xD;
      size of n=150 is estimated on the basis of feasibility. Investigators aim to recruit all&#xD;
      consecutive patients who attend our department over a 1 year period. With an expected&#xD;
      drop-out rate of 10% , investigators anticipate that it will be feasible to enrol 150&#xD;
      patients in the required time-frame.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PARTICIPANTS: The study target population will be patients aged 80 years or more, who are&#xD;
      admitted or referred to the cardiology department because of underlying coronary artery&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IDENTIFICATION &amp; RECRUITMENT: These participants will be recruited into the study from&#xD;
      outpatient cardiology clinics and from identification of suitable inpatients admitted to the&#xD;
      cardiology and cardiothoracic units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BASELINE ASSESSMENT: The baseline assessment will include gathering patient baseline&#xD;
      demographic data, current diagnosis and clinical status, assessment of the comorbid&#xD;
      conditions, and information regarding relevant investigation results including blood results,&#xD;
      electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiogram and coronary angiography data. Participants will be&#xD;
      asked to complete QoL questionnaire and undergo the frailty assessments. This will entail&#xD;
      completion of several questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SF-12 QoL QUESTIONNAIRE: This questionnaire of 12 questions have been extensively used in&#xD;
      research practice and validated to assess QoL in a variety of clinical settings20.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FRAILTY ASSESSMENT: This will be evaluated using both the Fried phenotype and Edmonton&#xD;
      frailty scale. Study participants will first be asked to complete the written questionnaires.&#xD;
      They will then have a measure of handgrip strength and if feasible will be asked to do 'get&#xD;
      up and go' and 'five metre walk 'test as detailed in the Edmonton and Fried assessments&#xD;
      respectively. Participants who are unable to walk will be marked as per the criteria. Where&#xD;
      applicable, participants will be allowed to use walking aids as required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Where applicable, the research team will also evaluate the results of coronary angiography&#xD;
      and will undertake both SYNTAX as well as EUROSCORE calculations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FOLLOW UP ASSESSMENTS: The study participants will be seen at 3, 9 and 24 month intervals and&#xD;
      will be asked to complete the QoL questionnaire and undergo frailty assessment. The following&#xD;
      variables will be recorded at each follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient symptoms- CCS angina class, NYHA class&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Height, weight, BMI, Vital signs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medication with dosages&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Document all major adverse outcomes: myocardial infarction, acute cerebrovascular event,&#xD;
           major bleeding, or unplanned re-hospitalisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Document any other adverse events such as kidney injury, transient ischaemic attack.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Document length of stay on ICU and total length of hospital stay (where applicable).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SF-12 questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fried Frailty phenotype&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Edmonton frailty scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient perspective survey form- Two separate patients perspective have been developed&#xD;
           depending whether the study participants are managed medically or undergo intervention&#xD;
           and cardiac surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DEATHS DURING THE STUDY PERIOD: Due to the advanced age of the study participants, it is&#xD;
      expected that some patients might die during the study period. In such a situation the data&#xD;
      already gathered will be retained in the study. Investigators will be advised to check on the&#xD;
      Hull and East Yorkshire NHS Trust record systems before sending out any follow up&#xD;
      appointments. The participant's family and relatives will not be approached after their&#xD;
      death.&#xD;
