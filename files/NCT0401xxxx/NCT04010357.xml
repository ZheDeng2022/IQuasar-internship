  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Test how well the study medicine Abemaciclib, a CDK4/6 inhibitor, works to shrink lung&#xD;
           cancer tumors in the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Test the safety of Abemaciclib when given to participants with small cell lung cancer&#xD;
           (SCLC). Specifically, this study is looking at SCLC that has not responded to treatment&#xD;
           (refractory) or come back after treatment with chemotherapy (relapsed) as the study&#xD;
           medication has been shown to be effective any time the disease relapses not just in the&#xD;
           first few months.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, non-randomized, phase 2, single arm study to determine the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of Abemaciclib as a single agent in patients with biopsy-proven wild type Rb&#xD;
      extensive stage of SCLC, with platinum refractory disease (defined as no response after 1-2&#xD;
      cycles of chemotherapy or relapse defined as initial response but relapse after completing&#xD;
      platinum-based chemotherapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abemaciclib (CDK4/6 inhibitors) is an investigational drug that works by interrupting the&#xD;
      rapid and uncontrolled growth of cancer cells. Some cancer cells develop because their cells&#xD;
      overrun the molecular brakes that normally permit cell to divide only when they are needed to&#xD;
      replace old ones. These brakes are regulated by a group of enzymes known as cyclin-dependent&#xD;
      kinases (CDKs). Alterations causing over-activity of two of these enzymes, CDK4 andCDK6, are&#xD;
      found in a variety of cancers, including small cell lung cancer with retinoblastoma (Rb)&#xD;
      protein. The drugs work by selectively turning off the overactive CDK4 and CDK6. As a result,&#xD;
      the cancer cells' division cycle is halted, preventing them from proliferating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this study include determining:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Overall Response Rate (ORR) after the first cycle (4 weeks) and then every 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Progression Free Survival (PFS)assessed at 6 months and Overall Survival (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety and adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Duration of response in all responders&#xD;

    <description>Safety and adverse events (AE's) (CTCAE grade version 5.0) will be assessed by quantifying the toxicities and grades experienced by subjects who have received Abemaciclib (Verzenio®[LY2835219]) including serious adverse events (SAEs). All SE's and grade 3 and 4 AE's will be tabulated.</description>

    <description>Duration of response in all responders (DoR using RECIST 1.1) assessed from the time that measurement criteria met until progressive disease is objectively documented.&#xD;
Progressive disease defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.

             limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has active bacterial infection (requiring intravenous [IV] antibiotics at&#xD;
             time of initiating study treatment), fungal infection, or detectable viral infection&#xD;

             for enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive subjects on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of&#xD;
