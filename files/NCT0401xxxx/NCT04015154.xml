  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This investigation is a prospective, multicenter clinical investigation. It is anticipated&#xD;
      that a total of 50 subjects will be enrolled at up to 5 sites. Enrollment is estimated to&#xD;
      commence in Q4 of 2018. Neither subjects nor investigators are blinded to treatment and the&#xD;
      clinical investigation includes a historical control which will be compared to the Femoral&#xD;
      Nail PF of the T2 Alpha Femur Antegrade GT/PF Nailing System.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total duration of enrollment, 12 month follow-up and analysis is expected to take 29 months.&#xD;
      The clinical investigation has been designed to follow the surgeon's standard of care for&#xD;
      femur fractured subjects, in addition to a 12 month follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of this clinical investigation is to confirm efficacy/performance at 12&#xD;
      months, as measured by the Lower Extremity Measure (LEM). Confirmation of&#xD;
      efficacy/performance at 12 months will be based on an equal or greater (non-inferior) LEM&#xD;
      score result of the Femoral Nail PF of the T2 Alpha Femur Antegrade GT/PF Nailing System&#xD;
      compared to the T2 Femur benchmark literature.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The objective of this clinical investigation is to demonstrate the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy/performance of the Femoral Nail PF of the T2 Alpha Femur Antegrade GT/PF Nailing&#xD;
      System. Efficacy/performance of the procedure will be measured by an equal or greater&#xD;
      (non-inferior) Lower Extremity Measure (LEM) score result of the Femoral Nail PF of the T2&#xD;
      Alpha Femur Antegrade GT/PF Nailing System compared to the T2 Femur benchmark literature at&#xD;
      12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, demonstration of bone consolidation in correct alignment will be measured by&#xD;
      Investigator assessment by 12 months. Safety of the Femoral Nail PF of the T2 Alpha Femur&#xD;
      Antegrade GT/PF Nailing System will be demonstrated through reporting of device related&#xD;
      intra-operative and post-operative Adverse Events/incidents by 12 months.&#xD;
