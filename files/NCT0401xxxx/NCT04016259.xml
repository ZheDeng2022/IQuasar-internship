    <measure>Experimental Pain Sensitivity as Measured Using a Multimodal Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST) Battery - Heat Pain Threshold (HPTH)</measure>
    <time_frame>week 2</time_frame>
    <description>In order to measure experimental pain sensitivity, a multimodal Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST) battery will be completed: heat pain threshold (HPTH), heat pain tolerance (HPTO), pressure pain threshold (PPT), and Conditioned Pain Modulation (CPM).&#xD;
To assess HPTH, heat stimuli were delivered to the participant's knee using a computer-controlled TSAII NeuroSensory Analyzer. From a baseline of 32 degrees Celsius, the temperature increased by 0.5 degrees Celsius per second until the participants responded by pressing a button to stop heat stimuli. Participants were instructed to press the button when the sensation ''first becomes painful&quot; to assess the heat pain threshold (HPTH).</description>

    <description>In order to measure experimental pain sensitivity, a multimodal Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST) battery will be completed: heat pain threshold (HPTH), heat pain tolerance (HPTO), pressure pain threshold (PPT), and Conditioned Pain Modulation (CPM).&#xD;
To assess PPT, a handheld digital pressure algometer (Wagner, Greenwich, CT) was applied at a constant rate of 0.3 kilograms force per centimeter squared (kgf/cm^2) per second to the participant's knee. Participants were asked to notify the experimenter when the pressure sensation ''first becomes painful&quot; to assess pressure pain threshold (PPT).</description>

    <description>In order to measure experimental pain sensitivity, a multimodal Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST) battery will be completed: heat pain threshold (HPTH), heat pain tolerance (HPTO), pressure pain threshold (PPT), and Conditioned Pain Modulation (CPM).&#xD;
CPM was assessed as the change in PPT on the trapezius immediately after the immersion of the contralateral hand up to the wrist in a cold-water bath (Neslab, Portsmouth, NH) at 12 degrees C for one minute. [To assess PPT, a handheld digital pressure algometer (Wagner, Greenwich, CT) was applied at a constant rate of 0.3 kilograms force per centimeter squared (kgf/cm^2) per second to the participant's trapezius.

Question 1. It was easy to prepare the device and accessories Question 2. The device was unnecessarily complex Question 3. The device was easy to use Question 4. I felt the video conferences with a technical person were helpful Question 5. I would imagine that most people would learn to use this device quickly Question 6. The device was cumbersome to use Question 7. I felt confident using the device Question 8. I needed to learn a lot of things before I could get going with this device Question 9. The effectiveness of the treatment increased over the course of treatment Question 10. I felt that transcranial electrical stimulation treatment benefited me</description>

        <description>In order to measure experimental pain sensitivity, a multimodal Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST) battery will be completed: heat pain threshold (HPTH), heat pain tolerance (HPTO), pressure pain threshold (PPT), and Conditioned Pain Modulation (CPM).&#xD;
To assess HPTH, heat stimuli were delivered to the participant's knee using a computer-controlled TSAII NeuroSensory Analyzer. From a baseline of 32 degrees Celsius, the temperature increased by 0.5 degrees Celsius per second until the participants responded by pressing a button to stop heat stimuli. Participants were instructed to press the button when the sensation ''first becomes painful&quot; to assess the heat pain threshold (HPTH).</description>
