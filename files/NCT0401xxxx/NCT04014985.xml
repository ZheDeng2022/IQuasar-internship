  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It was proposed to the French Association of Rett Syndrome (AFSR) to perform an extensive&#xD;
      biological assessment in a series of 100 girls with Rett's syndrome and carriers of a&#xD;
      mutation in the MECP2 gene in order to confirm or confirm to reverse the abnormalities&#xD;
      identified previously and possibly, to highlight new biomarkers of the pathology. The&#xD;
      analysis will focus on classical hematological criteria, iron markers, endocrine assays,&#xD;
      lipid quantification and markers of inflammation. At the end of the project, each family will&#xD;
      receive the complete biological assessment carried out on their daughter which will represent&#xD;
      a direct benefit of the implication in this clinical research project.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The MECP2 (Methyl-CpG binding protein) gene, located on the X X28 chromosome, encodes a&#xD;
      heterochromatin nuclear protein. Mecp2 is preferentially found in neurons at a postmitotic&#xD;
      stage where it promotes brain development. Its ability to fix methylated DNA and contribute&#xD;
      to the formation of a transcriptional repression complex attributes this protein to a crucial&#xD;
      role in the control of gene expression. However, until today, its exact role is not known. In&#xD;
      humans, mutations in the MECP2 gene are at the origin of neurological diseases, the main one&#xD;
      being Rett's syndrome (RTT-MIM # 312750) where a mutation of MECP2 is found in 95% of cases.&#xD;
      This dominant pathology linked to the X chromosome has a prevalence of 1/10000 to 1/15000&#xD;
      births and affects mostly girls. The course of the pathology is characterized by a cessation&#xD;
      of development between 6 and 18 months after birth. Patients present a set of characteristic&#xD;
      signs including regression of acquired abilities, manual stereotyping, loss of language,&#xD;
      behavioral disorders and severe intellectual disability. In their attempt to better&#xD;
      understand the pathology, many laboratories are currently trying to identify abnormal&#xD;
      biological parameters in patients that are easy to identify in a non-invasive or minimally&#xD;
      invasive way in order to indirectly evaluate the progression of the pathology and to identify&#xD;
      biochemical disorders amenable to direct pharmacological intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In autumn 2015, several factors were identified as deregulated in model mice or RTT patients&#xD;
      (Rett syndrome). They could be related to the severity of the disease and indicators of its&#xD;
      progression. Among these we can mention:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  major structural damage to red blood cells;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inflammation demonstrated and challenged ;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  high oxidative stress markers; lipid deregulation and in particular cholesterol&#xD;
           abnormalities;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a deficiency of the signaling pathway of insulin and IGF-1.&#xD;
