      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The therapy used in this study is called E7 TCR T cell therapy. This therapy is a type of&#xD;
      treatment in which a participant s T cells (a type of immune system cell) are changed in the&#xD;
      laboratory to attack cancer cells. This treatment might help people with human papilloma&#xD;
      virus (HPV)-associated oropharyngeal cancer. Oropharyngeal cancer is a type of head and neck&#xD;
      cancer that happens in the oropharynx (the part of the throat at the back of the mouth,&#xD;
      including the soft palate, the base of the tongue, and the tonsils). Certain types of the HPV&#xD;
      virus can cause this kind of cancer. This study is looking at treatments for cancer caused by&#xD;
      HPV-16.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine if E7 TCR T cells can be given safely without&#xD;
      delaying standard treatment for HPV-16 associated oropharyngeal cancer. Standard treatment&#xD;
      may be surgery or radiation therapy with chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility: People ages 18 and older with Stage II or III HPV-16 associated oropharyngeal&#xD;
      cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with HLA typing (a blood test needed for eligibility) and HPV&#xD;
      testing of the cancer tumor (to determine if the cancer is HPV-16 positive). A new biopsy may&#xD;
      be needed if tumor from an outside location is not available for HPV testing. Eligible&#xD;
      participants will come to the NIH campus to have a screening evaluation which will include&#xD;
      physical exam, review of medical history and current medications, blood and heart tests,&#xD;
      imaging (X-ray, CT scan, MRI or PET scan), and evaluation of participant s veins that are&#xD;
      used for drawing blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the participant is eligible for the study based on the screening evaluation, they will&#xD;
      have a baseline evaluation prior to receiving the experimental treatment. The baseline&#xD;
      evaluation may include additional laboratory or imaging tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a large IV catheter inserted into a vein to undergo a procedure called&#xD;
      leukapheresis. Leukapheresis is the removal of the blood by a machine to collect specific&#xD;
      blood cells. The remaining blood is returned to the body. This procedure is needed to collect&#xD;
      the cells that will be modified to target the cancer. These cells will be grown in the lab&#xD;
      and given back to the participant through an IV. It takes 11-15 days to grow the cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the cells are growing, the participant will be admitted to the hospital about one week&#xD;
      before cell infusion. They will receive 2 types of chemotherapy through an IV catheter over 5&#xD;
      days. The main purpose of the chemotherapy is to make the cells more effective in fighting&#xD;
      the cancer tumors. The cells will be given through an IV catheter 1-3 days after the last&#xD;
      dose of chemotherapy. Within 24 hours after the cell infusion, participants will be given a&#xD;
      cell growth factor called aldesleukin through an IV. Aldesleukin is thought to help the cells&#xD;
      live longer in the participant s body. Participants will recover in the hospital until they&#xD;
      are well enough to go home. This is usually about 7-12 days after the cell infusion or last&#xD;
      dose of aldesleukin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have follow-up visits starting every 2 weeks after the date of cell&#xD;
      infusion. These will be visits to monitor the safety of the treatment and to evaluate the&#xD;
      response of the cancer to the treatment. These visits will continue if the cancer is&#xD;
      shrinking. The participant will go back to their local cancer doctor for further care if the&#xD;
      cancer stops shrinking, goes away completely or gets bigger.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have blood drawn periodically to test if the cells have grown or changed.&#xD;
      These blood tests will take place immediately before the cells are given, and then at 3, 6,&#xD;
      12 months for the first year and then annually. These tests can be drawn locally and sent to&#xD;
      the NIH. Participants will be asked to return to the NIH annually for a physical examination&#xD;
      for 5 years after they receive the cells. After that time, participants will be asked to&#xD;
      fill-out a questionnaire for the next ten years, for a total follow-up period of 15 years.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Human papillomavirus (HPV)+ oropharyngeal cancer is an increasingly common type of&#xD;
           cancer that frequently affects young patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The treatment for locoregionally advanced cancer carries substantial life-long&#xD;
           morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Although the overall prognosis for HPV+ oropharyngeal cancer is favorable, about 20&#xD;
           percent of patients with stage II disease and 35 percent of patients with stage III&#xD;
           disease will die within five years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Induction therapy is an area of active study in this type of cancer. The aims of&#xD;
           induction therapy are to reduce the risk of disease recurrence and potentially to permit&#xD;
           the study of de-intensified definitive treatment of locoregional disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  E7 TCR T cells, administered as a single infusion, have demonstrated safety and clinical&#xD;
           activity in treatment-refractory metastatic HPV+ cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To determine the feasibility of systemic treatment with E7 TCR T cells for stage II or stage&#xD;
      III HPV+ oropharyngeal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients greater than or equal to 18 years old with stage II or stage III HPV+&#xD;
           oropharyngeal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The cancer must be HPV16+ and patient must be HLA-A 02:01+ HLA type.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must be treatment-naive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a phase II, single arm, feasibility study of induction E7 TCR T cell therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will receive a conditioning regimen of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, a&#xD;
           single infusion of E7 TCR T cells, and systemic aldesleukin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be referred for standard of care definitive therapy (chemoradiation or&#xD;
           surgery) at the time of maximum tumor response&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed stage II or stage III (AJCC 8th edition)&#xD;
             oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma that has not been treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HPV16+ tumor and HLA-A 02:01+ HLA type (HLA-A 02 is also acceptable for determination&#xD;
             of eligibility).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Measurable disease by RECIST 1.1 criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient age 18 and older. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently&#xD;
             available on the use of E7 TCR T Cells in patients &lt;18 years of age, children are&#xD;
             excluded from this study. This reflects the age range of patients with the disease&#xD;
             being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status 0 or 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test because E7 TCR T&#xD;
             Cells have unknown potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Women of&#xD;
             child-bearing potential are defined as all women who are not post-menopausal or who&#xD;
             have not had a hysterectomy. Postmenopausal will be defined as women over the age of&#xD;
             55 who have not had a menstrual period in at least 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of E7 TCR T Cells on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this&#xD;
             reason and because the chemotherapy agents used in this trial are known to be&#xD;
             teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate&#xD;
             contraception (intrauterine device, hormonal or barrier method of birth control;&#xD;
             abstinence; tubal ligation or vasectomy) prior to study entry and for four months&#xD;
             after treatment. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she&#xD;
             or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating&#xD;
             physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Seronegative for HIV antibody. The experimental treatment being evaluated in this&#xD;
             protocol depends on an intact immune system. Patients who are HIV seropositive can&#xD;
             have decreased immune-competence and thus be less responsive to the experimental&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Seronegative for hepatitis B antigen and hepatitis C antibody. If hepatitis C antibody&#xD;
             test is positive, then the patient must be tested for the presence of antigen by&#xD;
             RT-PCR and be HCV RNA negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must be willing to participate in Gene Therapy Long Term Followup Protocol, which will&#xD;
             follow patients for up to 15 years per Food and Drug Administration (FDA)&#xD;
             requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  leukocytes- greater than or equal to 3,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  absolute neutrophil count- greater than or equal to 1,500/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  platelets- greater than or equal to 100,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  hemoglobin- greater than or equal to 9.0 g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  total bilirubin- within normal institutional limits except in patients with&#xD;
                  Gilbert s Syndrome who must have a total bilirubin &lt; 3.0 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT)- Serum ALT/AST &lt; 2.5 times ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  creatinine clearance- Calculated creatinine clearance (CrCl) &gt;50mL/min/1.73m(2)&#xD;
                  for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal (by the Chronic&#xD;
                  Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability of subject to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed&#xD;
             consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of severe allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or&#xD;
             biologic composition to agents used in study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations at the time of treatment that&#xD;
             would limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  There is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary&#xD;
             to treatment of the mother with E7 TCR T Cells. For this reason, women may not&#xD;
             breastfeed while receiving study treatment and for one year after the study treatment&#xD;
             ends. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with any form of systemic immunodeficiency, including acquired deficiency&#xD;
             such as HIV or primary immunodeficiency such as Severe Combined Immunodeficiency&#xD;
             Disease, are ineligible. The experimental treatment being evaluated in this protocol&#xD;
             depends on an intact immune system. Patients who have decreased immune competence may&#xD;
             be less responsive to the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current use of immunosuppressive medication, EXCEPT for the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Intranasal, inhaled, topical steroids, or local steroid injection (e.g.,&#xD;
                  intra-articular injection);&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Systemic corticosteroids at physiologic doses less than equal to 10 mg/day of&#xD;
                  prednisone or equivalent;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Steroids as premedication for hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., CT scan&#xD;
                  premedication)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with autoimmune diseases such as Crohn s disease, ulcerative colitis,&#xD;
             rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune hepatitis, autoimmune pancreatitis, or systemic lupus&#xD;
             erythematosus. Hypothyroidism, vitiligo and other minor autoimmune disorders are not&#xD;
             exclusionary.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a second active invasive cancer are not eligible if it may confound&#xD;
             assessment of response to the current therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who do not have a local physician to provide standard therapy post treatment.&#xD;
