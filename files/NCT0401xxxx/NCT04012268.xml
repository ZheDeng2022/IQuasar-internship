      There are a series of symptoms such as ischemic stroke、transient ischemic attack 、hemorrhagic&#xD;
      stroke、headache 、seizure and so on in moyamoya disease. Nowadays, revascularization is the&#xD;
      only effective way for ischemic MMD while controversial for hemorrhagic MMD patients.&#xD;
      Surgical complications including hyperperfusion syndrome, cerebral infarction or bleeding&#xD;
      often occurred postoperatively. There is no effective conservative treatment for MMD up to&#xD;
      now.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Remote ischemic conditioning is Remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) is a noninvasive and&#xD;
      easy-to-use neuroprotective strategy, and it has potential effects on preventing ischemia&#xD;
      reperfusion injury and ischemic infarction.This study was to explore the safety and efficacy&#xD;
      of remote ischemic conditioning on adult MMD patients.&#xD;

    <description>Cerebral blood flow refers to the flow of blood through a certain cross-sectional area of cerebrovascular in a unit time. Patients' CBF will be detected by arterial spin labeling. In each hemisphere, middle cerebral artery territory was divided into ten regions according to Albert Stroke Program Early CT score (ASPECTS), regions of interest (ROI) were drawn manually in each of territory of MCA to determine the absolute CBF values. improvement ratio of mean CBF= mCBF atter treatment-mCBF baseline/mCBF baseline.</description>
