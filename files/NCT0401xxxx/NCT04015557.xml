  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In homocystinuria due to cystathionine beta synthase (CBS) deficiency or classical&#xD;
      homocystinuria, decreased blood cysteine levels are observed. Cysteine is essential for the&#xD;
      synthesis of molecules such as glutathione and taurine. Main functions of glutathione are to&#xD;
      detoxify drugs and to scavenge reactive oxygen species. N-acetylcysteine is a commercially&#xD;
      available drug chemically similar to cysteine. In CBS deficient animal models,&#xD;
      N-acetylcysteine supplementation improves cysteine and liver glutathione concentrations.&#xD;
      N-acetylcysteine also acts directly as a scavenger of free radicals. In CBS deficiency,&#xD;
      increased oxidative damage has been described and possibly contributes to the clinical&#xD;
      manifestations of CBS deficiency. Acetaminophen (Paracetamol) is a common painkiller and its&#xD;
      overdose (&gt;4 g/day) is a major cause of acute liver failure. Glutathione is required for&#xD;
      Acetaminophen detoxification, and the preferred treatment for an overdose is the&#xD;
      administration of N-acetylcysteine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to demonstrate that CBS deficiency patients have glutathione&#xD;
      depletion and to investigate if Acetaminophen can induce subclinical liver damage and if&#xD;
      N-acetylcysteine supplementation could prevent the toxic-effects of acetaminophen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' hypothesis is that CBS deficiency patients have an inadequate supply of&#xD;
      cysteine for the glutathione synthesis, which impairs antioxidants defenses and increases&#xD;
      risk of intoxication of drugs that require glutathione, such as Acetaminophen. This potential&#xD;
      increased liver toxicity induced by drugs or other xenobiotics that are detoxified by the&#xD;
      glutathione pathway has not been explored in CBS deficiency patients. The experiments should&#xD;
      provide answers about the functional role of cysteine and glutathione depletion in CBS&#xD;
      deficiency and if N-acetylcysteine might have a place as an adjunct therapy for CBS&#xD;
      deficiency.&#xD;

      STUDY PROCEDURES&#xD;
&#xD;
      A phase I-II clinical cross-over, not blinded, trial will be conducted. Adult patients with&#xD;
      homocystinuria and paired-sex and age- healthy controls will be enrolled. Individuals with&#xD;
      hepatic, renal or gastric disease; smokers, illicit drugs users or those who are&#xD;
      hypersensitive to any of the components of the drugs tested (acetaminophen and&#xD;
      N-acetylcysteine ) will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be submitted to two procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 1: In this stage, individuals will receive a single standard dose of Acetaminophen&#xD;
      (1.5g) orally and blood samples will be drawn at time 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 hours after the&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 2: In this stage, individuals will receive again a normal dose of acetaminophen (1.5g)&#xD;
      orally and one hour later a single dose of oral N-acetylcysteine (70 mg per kilogram of body&#xD;
      weight)(. Blood samples will be drawn at the same points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In plasma we will measure methionine, homocysteine, cysteine and glutathione by LC-MS/MS.&#xD;
      Taurine will also be determined by Biochrom 30 Amino Acid Analyser. Pyroglutamate will be&#xD;
      determined as a marker for glutathione depletion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As markers of oxidative stress we will assay thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances, protein&#xD;
      carbonyl content, thiol content, DNA damage 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein fluorescence assay, and&#xD;
      activities of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione&#xD;
      peroxidase . Liver function parameters aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase&#xD;
      (ALT) activities will also be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All measurements will be performed at all 5 points of blood collection and in the two stages&#xD;
      of the trial.&#xD;
