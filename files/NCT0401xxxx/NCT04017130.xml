    <textblock>
      This will be a Phase 1 Open-Label, dose escalation and expansion study of MT-0169 (an&#xD;
      Engineered toxin body (ETB) in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma or&#xD;
      non-Hodgkin lymphoma. MT-0169 is an investigational drug that recognizes and binds to the&#xD;
      CD38 receptor, which may be found on the surface of multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma&#xD;
      cancer cells. It delivers a dose of a modified toxin that kills these cells.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is conducted in 2 parts. The study will enroll up to 198 total participants (up to&#xD;
      54 RRMM participants in both Part 1 and Part 2 and up to 90 RRNHL participants in Part 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 (Dose Escalation): The purpose of Part 1 is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      MT-0169 in subjects with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) and to estimate the&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) Part 2 (Dose Expansion):&#xD;
      The purpose of Part 2 is to confirm the RP2D and to evaluate the preliminary clinical&#xD;
      activity of MT-0169 monotherapy in patients with RRMM and relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin&#xD;
      lymphoma (RR NHL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      MT-0169 will be given as an intravenous (IV) infusion over 60 minutes on the same day every&#xD;
      week (i.e., days 1, 8, 15 and 22) or every 2 weeks (i.e., days 1 and 15) of each cycle. A&#xD;
      cycle is defined as 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Parts 1 and 2, a subject may participate for the following three (3) periods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Period - up to 28 days before first dose of MT-0169 Treatment Period - active&#xD;
      period where a subject will receive doses of MT-0169 over a 28-day treatment period Follow-up&#xD;
      Period - up to 12 months after the last patient in the study to receive the last dose of&#xD;
      MT-0169.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both parts of the study, participants can receive MT-0169 until the cancer worsens, side&#xD;
      effects prevent further study treatment, or until the participant leaves the study for other&#xD;
      reasons decided by the participant, the study doctor, or the sponsor of the study. After&#xD;
      treatment has finished, participants will have a check-up of their disease status every 12&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drug being tested in this study is called MT-0169. The study will evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, preliminary efficacy, PK, pharmacodynamics, and immunogenicity of MT-0169&#xD;
      monotherapy in participants with RRMM or RRNHL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center trial will be conducted worldwide. The overall duration of the study will&#xD;
      vary for each participant because they will receive study treatment until unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity, withdrawal of consent, death, termination of the study by the sponsor, or&#xD;
      fulfillment of another discontinuation criterion. Participants will be followed up for 30&#xD;
      days after the last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment for any side effects.&#xD;
      Participants will then be followed every 12 weeks to check for the status of their disease up&#xD;
      to 12 months after the last subject on the trial has the last dose of study drug, or the&#xD;
      sponsor discontinues the study, whichever occurs first.&#xD;

Decision to escalate/deescalate/stay on the same dose/discontinue MT-0169 will be based on number of DLTs per number of patients enrolled at each dose level as predetermined by the mTPI-2 statistical model. Additionally, the investigator and sponsor review of available safety, PK, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy data in the previous cohorts will also be factored in the decision.</description>
