  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The term ''Non-invasive ventilation'' (NIV) refers to various methods of respiratory&#xD;
      assistance, in the absence of an indwelling endotracheal tube. In recent years, the use of&#xD;
      NIV has increased for the treatment of both acute and chronic pediatric respiratory failure.&#xD;
      Patient tolerance to the technique is a critical factor determining its success in avoiding&#xD;
      endotracheal intubation. One of the key factors determining tolerance to NIV is optimal&#xD;
      synchrony between the patient's spontaneous breathing activity and the ventilator's set&#xD;
      parameters, known as ''patient-ventilator interaction''.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indeed, synchronization of the ventilator breath with the patient's inspiratory effort,&#xD;
      optimizes comfort, minimizes work of breathing and reduces the need for sedation. During NIV,&#xD;
      several factors can significantly interfere with the function of the ventilator, leading to&#xD;
      an increased risk of asynchrony. Indeed, the presence of unintentional leaks at the&#xD;
      patient-mask interface, the sensitivity of inspiratory and expiratory triggers, the ability&#xD;
      to compensate for intentional and unintentional leaks and the presence/absence of expiratory&#xD;
      valves are all factors that likely play a role in determining patient-ventilator&#xD;
      synchronization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators therefore designed the present crossover trial in order to compare the&#xD;
      degree of respiratory asynchronies during NIV using different ventilators (Turbine-driven&#xD;
      ventilator vs. compressed air-driven ICU ventilators) and different setups (single circuit&#xD;
      vs. double circuit) in children with acute respiratory failure.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      After having obtained the signed informed consent from the parents of the patient, a 6 Fr&#xD;
      pediatric esophageal balloon-catheter will be placed through a nostril in the distal third of&#xD;
      the esophagus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This minimally invasive procedure, will allow to monitor and record esophageal pressure&#xD;
      swings, which are strongly correlated to pleural pressure variations and therefore allow to&#xD;
      detect accurately patients' inspiratory efforts. Furthermore, surface electrodes will be&#xD;
      placed in order to record the electrical activity of the diaphragm non-invasively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In every patient, three breathing trials (30 minutes each) will be performed in randomized&#xD;
      order:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. NIV performed with a double limb circuit and expiratory valve incorporated in the&#xD;
           ventilator, delivered with a pediatric/neonatal ICU ventilator (Babylog VN500, Draeger).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. NIV performed with a single limb circuit and intentional leak (vented mask) delivered&#xD;
           with a turbine-driven ventilator (Astral 150 [ResMed] ).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. NIV performed with a double limb circuit and expiratory valve incorporated in the&#xD;
           ventilator, delivered with the same turbine-driven ventilator of point 2 (Astral 150&#xD;
           [ResMed]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NIV setting decided clinically will not be modified for the study and will be held&#xD;
      constant throughout the different study phases. Similarly, if sedative drugs are being&#xD;
      delivered to the patient, the attending physician will decide their dose and it will be kept&#xD;
      constant throughout the study phases. The Comfort scale will be assessed for each study&#xD;
      phase, in order to evaluate and describe the comfort/distress of the patients during the&#xD;
      different ventilatory strategies. Esophageal pressure tracings, inspiratory/expiratory air&#xD;
      flows, airway pressure measured at the patient-ventilator interface and electrical activity&#xD;
      of the diaphragm (measured with surface electrodes) will be continuously recorded with a&#xD;
      dedicated software throughout the study in order to compute, offline, the asynchrony index&#xD;
      (see below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Asynchronies will be defined according to previous studies on the subject:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Auto-triggering (AT): a cycle delivered by the ventilator in the absence of a typical&#xD;
           esophageal swing;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Ineffective Effort (IE): a deflection on the esophageal pressure monitoring not followed&#xD;
           by an assisted cycle;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Late cycling (LC): a cycle with a ventilator inspiratory time greater than twice the&#xD;
           esophageal time;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Premature cycling (PC): a cycle with a ventilator inspiratory time shorter than the&#xD;
           neural inspiratory time;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Double triggering (DT): two ventilator-delivered cycles separated by a very short&#xD;
           inspiratory time, during the same inspiratory Eadi signal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The entity of asynchronies can be numerical summarized in the Asynchrony Index (AI), which is&#xD;
      calculated as the total number of asynchrony events divided by the total number of&#xD;
      non-triggered and triggered ventilatory cycles (expressed as percentage).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Asynchrony Index (%) = [(AT + IE + LC + PC + DT) / (RRpes + AT)]×100 Where AT refers to&#xD;
      Auto-triggering, IE to ineffective triggering, LC to late cycling, PC to premature cycling,&#xD;
      DT to double triggering and RRpes to the respiratory rate as measured using the esophageal&#xD;
      pressure tracing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, the number of each type of asynchrony will be assessed (number of events per&#xD;
      minute), in order to identify the most relevant types of asynchronies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization The randomization of the three NIV-phases will be performed with an online&#xD;
      randomization software called &quot;Research Randomizer&quot; (https://www.randomizer.org). No risk of&#xD;
      bias is foreseen, as all patients will undergo the three interventions (cross-over study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding. The respiratory traces registered during the different study phases and analyzed&#xD;
      offline in order compute the &quot;Asynchrony Index&quot; will be evaluated by an investigator blinded&#xD;
      to the type of intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY ENDPOINT Primary endpoint of the present study is the difference in Asynchrony Index&#xD;
      (expressed as %) obtained during NIV performed with an ICU ventilator using a double limb&#xD;
      circuit and the value obtained during NIV performed with single limb circuit with intentional&#xD;
      leak with a turbine-driven ventilator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoint Secondary endpoint of the present study is the difference in Asynchrony&#xD;
      Index (expressed as %) obtained during NIV performed with an ICU ventilator using a double&#xD;
      limb circuit and the value obtained with the same type of circuit, but with a turbine-driven&#xD;
      ventilator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Sample size calculation. The sample size for the primary endpoint of the&#xD;
      study has been calculated using the software G*Power 3.1.9.2 using a paired t-test and using&#xD;
      as outcome parameter the difference in Asynchrony Index (AI) during NIV performed with ICU&#xD;
      ventilators and with turbine-driven ventilators applied with single limb circuit and&#xD;
      intentional leaks. Based on available data the investigators estimated in our population an&#xD;
      AI of 59±13% and considered a 20% reduction of its value as clinically relevant (AI=47±13%).&#xD;
      Considering a two-tailed alfa error of 0.05 and a desired power of 0.8, with an effect size&#xD;
      of 0.923 the investigators calculated a sample size of 12 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA ANALYSIS All data will be tested for homogeneity of variance and normality of&#xD;
      distribution using the Shapiro- Wilk test. Normally distributed data will be expressed as&#xD;
      mean ± standard deviation, while nonnormally distributed data as median and interquartile&#xD;
      range. The presence of outliers will be carefully assessed during evaluation of distribution&#xD;
      of data; however, no action is foreseen to exclude outliers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables (Asynchrony Index, respiratory rate, tidal volume, minute ventilation, esophageal&#xD;
      pressure variation, etc.) recorded during the different NIV modalities will be compared via&#xD;
      paired t-test or Signed Rank Sum test, as appropriate. Mean difference and its 95% CI will be&#xD;
      calculated for normally distributed data. For non-normally distributed variables, median&#xD;
      difference and its 95% CI will be estimated by Hodges-Lehmann's median analysis. All tests&#xD;
      will be two tailed and statistical significance is defined as p&lt;0.050. Analysis will be&#xD;
      performed with SigmaPlot v.12.0 (Systat Software Inc., San Jose, CA) and SAS 9.2 (SAS&#xD;
      Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of note, the above-noted statistical procedures are appropriate but will not exclude other&#xD;
      procedures that may also be used in addition to or in lieu of the stated procedures in order&#xD;
      to best analyze the data. No control subjects will be needed, as each patient will serve as&#xD;
      its own control for the subsequent measurements (cross-over study).&#xD;
