    <textblock>
      A non-dispensing, double-masked, randomized, contralateral study comparing the 1-day toric&#xD;
      test contact lens against the 1-day toric control contact lens to evaluate the clinical&#xD;
      performance over one hour of lens wear. Each subject will be randomized to wear the test lens&#xD;
      in one eye and the control lens in the other eye for each pair of lenses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will be asked to wear four pairs of contact lenses in the study&#xD;
