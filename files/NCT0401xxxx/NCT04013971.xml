      This study will conduct a preliminary evaluation of and obtain user data on a novel&#xD;
      game-based visual interface for stroke gait training. Study participants will complete one&#xD;
      session comprising exposure to gait biofeedback systems in an order determined by block&#xD;
      randomization (3 blocks). Participants will be exposed to 3 types of biofeedback interfaces:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the anterior ground reaction forces (AGRF) biofeedback game (projector-display,&#xD;
           non-augmented reality [AR])&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AR version of the biofeedback game (head-mounted AR display)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  traditional, non-game-based, interface&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability. Even after discharge from rehabilitation,&#xD;
      residual gait deficits are prevalent in stroke survivors, leading to decreased walking speed&#xD;
      and endurance. Because gait dysfunctions limit community mobility, stroke survivors and&#xD;
      rehabilitation clinicians consider restoration of walking a major goal of rehabilitation.&#xD;
      Several challenges and research gaps limit the effectiveness of current clinical gait&#xD;
      rehabilitation practices. While there is consensus that stroke survivors benefit from gait&#xD;
      rehabilitation, agreement is lacking on which specific training interventions are most&#xD;
      efficacious. The long-term goal of this proposal is to address these challenges by developing&#xD;
      personalized, engaging, salient gait training treatments founded on evidence from&#xD;
      neuroscience, biomechanics, motor learning, and gaming.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Real-time biofeedback is a promising gait training intervention for targeting specific&#xD;
      biomechanical impairments. Biofeedback can enhance an individual's awareness of the&#xD;
      impairment targeted during gait training, enabling self-correction of aberrant gait patterns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In response to treadmill training combined with visual and auditory real-time biofeedback,&#xD;
      able-bodied individuals can increase AGRF unilaterally for the targeted limb. Thus, AGRF&#xD;
      biofeedback may be a beneficial strategy to target unilateral propulsive deficits in people&#xD;
      post-stroke. Incorporation of gaming interfaces for gait biofeedback can increase patient&#xD;
      motivation, distract participants from fatigue or boredom, and encourage greater numbers of&#xD;
      repetitions during gait training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long-term goal of this study is to develop a more engaging, motivating gait biofeedback&#xD;
      methodologies specifically designed for post-stroke gait training. The researchers aim to&#xD;
      address a major challenge for rehabilitation clinicians - to make gait training appealing and&#xD;
      meaningful so that patients engage in sufficient repetitions, intensity, and challenge to&#xD;
      maximize therapeutic effectiveness. The study premise is that post-stroke individuals will&#xD;
      demonstrate greater engagement, motivation, and therapeutic benefits during gait training&#xD;
      sessions involving biofeedback when training incorporates intuitive, entertaining, game-based&#xD;
      interfaces. Outcomes of the study will include measures of participant engagement,&#xD;
      user-reports and survey-responses on motivation, fatigue, game characteristics, and adverse&#xD;
      effects (e.g. nausea, dizziness) during game exposure. In addition to this clinical trial&#xD;
      with stroke survivor participants, data about the game interface will be collected by having&#xD;
      able-bodied neuro-rehabilitation clinicians try the 3 types of biofeedback interventions.&#xD;
