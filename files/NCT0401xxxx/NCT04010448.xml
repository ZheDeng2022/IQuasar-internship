  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trial will be a multinational, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, endpoint driven,&#xD;
      group-sequential, active comparator-controlled study, in which participating infants will be&#xD;
      randomized 1:1 to receive either: 1) 90 µg of the TV P2-VP8 vaccine IM plus oral placebo, or&#xD;
      2) Rotarix® per os (PO) plus IM placebo. Participants will receive three doses of TV&#xD;
      P2-VP8/placebo IM and two doses of Rotarix®/placebo PO at monthly intervals starting at ≥6 to&#xD;
      &lt;8 weeks of age, administered concomitantly with EPI/UIP vaccines. To maintain the blind,&#xD;
      infants allocated to the TV P2-VP8 vaccine arm will receive both TV P2-VP8 IM as well as oral&#xD;
      placebo vaccine, and infants allocated to receive Rotarix® will receive both Rotarix® PO and&#xD;
      placebo IM. Active surveillance for episodes of gastroenteritis (GE) will be conducted&#xD;
      throughout the study, through weekly contact with participants' parents. Unsolicited AEs&#xD;
      grade ≥ 2 through 28 days after the last study vaccination will be recorded in the study&#xD;
      database, as will data for SAEs (including intussusception) throughout the study.&#xD;
