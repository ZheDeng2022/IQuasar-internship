  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is investigating the development of a diagnostic test intended to predict flares&#xD;
      in patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus. Over a six-month period, the participant will&#xD;
      donate blood samples for researchers to evaluate the types of proteins that are in their&#xD;
      blood. During this time the participant will also visit a research physician to undergo a&#xD;
      physical exam that will include an evaluation of the disease's level of activity.&#xD;
      Questionnaires will be answered too, either via email, phone call, or a research app for&#xD;
      android and iPhone devices. During this six-month period, if the participant experiences a&#xD;
      lupus flare, they are strongly encouraged to visit the research physician to receive a&#xD;
      complimentary medical evaluation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to further validate an algorithm used in a lupus&#xD;
      flare-prediction that has been developed. The investigators will be looking at different&#xD;
      proteins in the blood that are commonly associated with lupus flares and could warn of the&#xD;
      risk of a future flare. Participation in this study will involve three separate visits with a&#xD;
      research physician for six months. These will proceed as a baseline visit, a three-month&#xD;
      visit, and a six-month visit. During each of these visits the physician assesses the&#xD;
      participant's physical condition and take blood samples for both research and medical&#xD;
      purposes. Throughout this study, the participant will also complete a series of&#xD;
      questionnaires to assess their wellness and day-to-day challenges. After the initial visit,&#xD;
      the participant will be contacted to complete a monthly survey that evaluates if there have&#xD;
      been any changes in your condition. This survey can be completed either via email, a phone&#xD;
      call discussion, or the study's unique research app. Three of these six surveys will be&#xD;
      completed during the physician's visit, however, the other three will be completed in the&#xD;
      preferred medium. Throughout the six-month period while you are on this study, if at any&#xD;
      point the participant experiences a flare, they are encouraged to visit the research&#xD;
      physician. During this visit, they will receive a physician's evaluation to ensure your&#xD;
      medical condition and collect blood samples for our research at no cost to the participant.&#xD;
