  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This four arm trial envisions to generate robust evidence for use of a fortified balanced&#xD;
      energy-protein supplement to pregnant women for at least 6 months, alone versus in&#xD;
      combination of Azithromycin (AZM) prophylaxis (two prophylaxis oral doses) versus in&#xD;
      combination with both AZM prophylaxis (two prophylaxis oral doses) plus oral Choline and&#xD;
      Nicotinamide supplementation; to see the impact on birth weight and length of newborn soon&#xD;
      after birth (approximately within 72 hours). This is an open label, community-based,&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial in peri-urban settings of Karachi, Pakistan, where the outcome&#xD;
      assessor will be blinded. The comparison groups are control arm (only routine ANC care and&#xD;
      nutritional counseling), nutrition only arm, nutrition plus AZM arm, and nutrition plus&#xD;
      Choline and Nicotinamide arm.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Maternal under nutrition has a critical role in etiology of poor perinatal outcomes like low&#xD;
      birth weight (LBW), accounting for 60-80% of all neonatal deaths and impacting nearly 20&#xD;
      million newborns overall. In Pakistan, nearly half of the households are food insecure with&#xD;
      or without hunger. Great disparities exist between urban-rural and within urban disadvantaged&#xD;
      populations living in the poorest of slums. In Sindh province alone, 72% of households are&#xD;
      food insecure and 50% are with moderate to severe hunger. Around 18% of the married woman of&#xD;
      reproductive age in Pakistan, are underweight and deficient of different micronutrients for&#xD;
      example, 42% and 41% of women are Vitamin A and Zinc deficient, respectively.. This impacts&#xD;
      childhood stunting, wasting, and underweight, prevalence of which, among under-five children&#xD;
      is around 44%, 15% and 31%, respectively in Pakistan. WHO antenatal care (ANC) guidelines&#xD;
      recommend the use of fortified balanced energy-protein supplements during pregnancy, but&#xD;
      there is a lack of guidance on the best product/supplement for use in a particular setting.&#xD;
      Until recently, the WHO ANC guidelines has made no recommendations on the use of these&#xD;
      supplements in food insecure and undernourished settings. This is an area that required&#xD;
      further research. Additionally, there is emerging literature on use of Choline and&#xD;
      Nicotinamide during pregnancy and its potential additional impact on birth outcomes including&#xD;
      growth and development after prenatal supplementation with Choline and Nicotinamide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Apart from nutrition supplement, the prophylaxis use of antibiotics, especially AZM is also&#xD;
      under strong debate, as many studies have shown improvements in birth outcomes in low middle&#xD;
      income settings. The possible mechanism of AZM may be explained through reduction in the risk&#xD;
      of maternal infections during pregnancy. A systematic review showed that prophylaxis may&#xD;
      reduce the risk of postpartum endometritis, preterm rupture of membranes and gonococcal&#xD;
      infection when given routinely to all pregnant women With no effect on birth outcome but&#xD;
      there were several biases reported such as high loss to follow-ups and limited numbers of&#xD;
      included studies.. Therefore, robust evidence is needed via a field trial in the local&#xD;
      context to evaluate the efficacy and effectiveness of the locally-produced, balanced&#xD;
      energy-protein supplement alone or in combination with prophylaxis dose of AZM or balanced&#xD;
      energy-protein supplement alone or in combination with Choline and Nicotinamide to pregnant&#xD;
      woman on maternal and birth outcomes in low-income and food insecure settings. This could&#xD;
      help to draw inferences for larger public health policy-making. This investment is&#xD;
      specifically aiming to look at what impact a newly formulated nutritional supplement for&#xD;
      pregnant and lactating women (PLW) can have on improving birth outcomes and as well as its&#xD;
      potential to reduce wasting, stunting and underweight in infants.&#xD;
