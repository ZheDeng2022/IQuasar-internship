  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vestibular disorders are disabling conditions that can have a major effect on functioning&#xD;
      especially on daily activities and social participation. Latest epidemiological studies&#xD;
      estimate that as many as 35% of adults aged 40 years or older had experienced some form of&#xD;
      vestibular dysfunction. Non invasive brain stimulation techniques such as repetitive&#xD;
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) have been investigated as therapeutic interventions&#xD;
      for various neurological disorders like motor deficits and balance disorders after various&#xD;
      neurological deficits. The purpose of this study is to compare between rTMs stimulation and&#xD;
      galvanic vestibular stimulation in patients with unilateral peripheral vestibular disorders.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A pilot study has been recruited to calculate sample size and determine rTMs protocol that&#xD;
      will be utilized during the study were two protocols has been compared and according to pilot&#xD;
      study results collaborated with literature review a established protocol has been utilized.&#xD;
      The subjects of both genders with age 30 to 60 will be allocated randomly into three equal&#xD;
      groups A, B and C. Group A Outcomes measure will include : VNG (videonystagmography),&#xD;
      Dizziness handicapped inventory, Berg balance scale, Vestibular disorders activities of daily&#xD;
      living scale(VADL). Assessment will be done before and after treatment sessions.&#xD;
