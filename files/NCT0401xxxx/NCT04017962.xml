    <description>Participants will be hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) recipients with a history of CMV infection. INTERVENTIONAL COHORT: Patients receive letermovir PO QD (or IV over 1 hour for patients unable to receive PO) for 14 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
OBSERVATIONAL COHORT: Patients undergo collection of blood samples for CMV-CMI analysis via CMV immunity T cell panel assay on day 100. Patients with negative CMI on day 100 undergo collection of blood samples for retesting on day 180.</description>

    <description>Patients enrolled on the study will receive oral LTV 480 mg daily (240 mg daily for patients receiving cyclosporine A). The maximum duration of LTV administration will be 14 weeks. Patients receiving oral medication will be administered a pill diary for drug compliance purposes. This will be administered and reconciled in clinic.</description>
