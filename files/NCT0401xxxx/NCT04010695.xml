      The primary objective of this study is to assess the accuracy of the SD Biosensor STANDARD&#xD;
      G6PD Analyzer in measuring G6PD activity when used by trained health care workers.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a cross-sectional diagnostic accuracy study with up to 250 participants with a goal&#xD;
      of obtaining 20 deficient and 20 intermediate samples. The clinic will recruit and consent&#xD;
      study participants. Clinic staff will draw 3 whole blood samples and obtain finger stick&#xD;
      capillary blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      G6PD activity is reported in terms of grams of hemoglobin (Hb), hence the hemoglobin&#xD;
      concentration must be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinic staff will perform the investigational Standard Diagnostics (SD) Biosensor&#xD;
      point-of-care (POC) test for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency and a&#xD;
      HemoCue® hemoglobin test on finger stick capillary blood and on the venous blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another venous blood sample will be sent to a clinical laboratory improvement amendments&#xD;
      (CLIA)-certified laboratory for reference testing by the gold standard assays:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  G6PD measurement by spectrophotometry using the Pointe Scientific G6PD reference assay&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  hemoglobin measurement by a hematology analyzer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals identified as G6PD deficient with the reference test will be notified of their&#xD;
      results by the clinic and referred to their physician for follow-up.&#xD;

    <measure>Sensitivity of SD Biosensor POC G6PD Test for Identifying G6PD Deficient Individuals</measure>
    <time_frame>All samples were collected on study day 1</time_frame>
    <description>For the purposes of this study, an individual was considered G6PD deficient if they tested positive in the Pointe Scientific assay. A true positive was defined as a participant with ≤ 30% of normal G6PD activity in circulating venous blood determined by the Pointe Scientific test.&#xD;
Diagnostic sensitivity of the SD Biosensor G6PD test is defined as the percentage of participants who tested positive for G6PD deficiency on the reference test who were identified by the test assay as positive, calculated as:&#xD;
Number of participants who were both test and true positive / (Number of participants who were test and true positive + Number of participants who were test negative but true positive [ie false negative]) * 100%.&#xD;
Sensitivity of the SD Biosensor POC G6PD test was calculated from both venous and capillary blood samples.</description>

    <measure>Sensitivity of SD Biosensor POC G6PD Test for Identifying Women With Intermediate G6PD Activity</measure>
    <time_frame>All samples were collected on study day 1</time_frame>
    <description>To investigate the performance of the SD Biosensor G6PD test to distinguish females with intermediate G6PD activity from females with normal activity, assay sensitivity was determined at a G6PD activity threshold of 70%. A true positive for intermediate G6PD activity in females was defined as G6PD activity between 30 and 70% of normal in circulating venous blood as determined by the Pointe Scientific test.&#xD;
Sensitivity of the SD Biosensor POC G6PD test is the percentage of women who tested positive for intermediate G6PD activity on the reference test who were identified by the test assay as positive, calculated as:&#xD;
Number of women who were both test and true positive / (Number of women who were test and true positive + Number of women who were test negative but true positive [ie false negative]) * 100%.&#xD;

        <title>Sensitivity of SD Biosensor POC G6PD Test for Identifying G6PD Deficient Individuals</title>
        <description>For the purposes of this study, an individual was considered G6PD deficient if they tested positive in the Pointe Scientific assay. A true positive was defined as a participant with ≤ 30% of normal G6PD activity in circulating venous blood determined by the Pointe Scientific test.&#xD;
Diagnostic sensitivity of the SD Biosensor G6PD test is defined as the percentage of participants who tested positive for G6PD deficiency on the reference test who were identified by the test assay as positive, calculated as:&#xD;
Number of participants who were both test and true positive / (Number of participants who were test and true positive + Number of participants who were test negative but true positive [ie false negative]) * 100%.&#xD;
Sensitivity of the SD Biosensor POC G6PD test was calculated from both venous and capillary blood samples.</description>
