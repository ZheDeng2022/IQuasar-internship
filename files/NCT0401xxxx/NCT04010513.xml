  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot randomized control trial of 30 women with interstitial cystitis/bladder pain&#xD;
      syndrome to determine the feasibility of delivering a hypnosis intervention or usual care on&#xD;
      bladder pain (primary outcome) and cerebral blood flow (secondary outcome). Women in the&#xD;
      hypnosis group will undergo treatment with three hypnotherapy sessions in addition to a&#xD;
      mobile web-based hypnosis application. Neuroimagning (fMRI) will occur after the first follow&#xD;
      up visit.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Available treatments do not provide adequate relief for bladder pain syndrome/interstitial&#xD;
      cystitis (BPS/IC), a chronic painful condition that affects 10 million women in the United&#xD;
      States. The investigators plan to conduct a pilot randomized control study to determine the&#xD;
      feasibility of conducting a combined CBT-hypnosis intervention vs. usual care in women with&#xD;
      BPS/IC for a subgroup of women, we will determine the effect of specific hypnotic words on&#xD;
      brain function using functional brain imaging. All women will have a pre-existing diagnosis&#xD;
      of BPS/IC and their baseline pain prior to therapy and novel (arterial spin labeling) and&#xD;
      more traditional (BOLD fMRI) neuroimaging techniques will be collected. Women in the hypnosis&#xD;
      group will undergo treatment with three in-person hypnotherapy sessions in addition to a&#xD;
      mobile web-based hypnosis application. Women in the usual care group will continue their&#xD;
      usual care for BPS/IC. Subjects in both groups will complete a variety of questionnaires on&#xD;
      bladder pain, urinary symptoms, sleep, mood, affect, disability, and sexual function before&#xD;
      and after treatment. The first follow up visit will occur at the end of treatment (4 weeks&#xD;
      after randomization). A select group of patients who are eligible to undergo neuroimaging&#xD;
      will be invited to participate in neuroimaging after the first follow up visit. Data will&#xD;
      also be collected at a second follow up visit at 2 months after randomization.&#xD;
