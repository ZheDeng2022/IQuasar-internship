  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular diseases are the second leading cause of death in France and the world's&#xD;
      leading cause.Coronary bifurcations are conducive to the development of atheromatous lesions&#xD;
      due to flow turbulence generating a pro-atherogenic effect. They represent about 15% of&#xD;
      coronary lesions and 30% of lesions in pluri truncular patients.Coronary bifurcation&#xD;
      angioplasty is a complex angioplasty with a high risk of complications.Numerous studies have&#xD;
      compared different angioplasty techniques with 2 stents in bifurcation lesions. However, two&#xD;
      studies of The Nordic-Baltic Bifurcation Study did not show at 6 months or 5 years of age any&#xD;
      significant difference in major cardiovascular events (death, heart attack, stent thrombosis,&#xD;
      emergency revascularization of the target vessel) in patients with a one-stent strategy&#xD;
      compared to the systematic use of two stents. There are also several post-expansion&#xD;
      techniques and the one that appears to be the most commonly used today (known as the&#xD;
      &quot;KISSING-BALLOON&quot;) consists of inflating two balloons at the same time, one in the main&#xD;
      branch and the other in the daughter branch in order to open the meshes of the stent towards&#xD;
      the daughter branch. Studies on a test bench to evaluate the deformation of a stent in&#xD;
      different coronary anatomies according to the material and technique used have nevertheless&#xD;
      revealed several limitations to this technique, in particular an elliptical deformation of&#xD;
      the stent linked to the inflation of 2 simultaneous balloons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From this work, a new technique known as &quot;POT SIDE POT&quot; was born, consisting in post dilating&#xD;
      the proximal part of the stent of the main branch in order to place it as closely as possible&#xD;
      against the wall, then open the stent meshes towards the lateral branch by balloon dilation&#xD;
      followed by a new post dilation of the proximal part of the mother branch stent to avoid the&#xD;
      use of 2 simultaneous balloons and thus reduce stent deformation by maintaining a circular&#xD;
      geometry while allowing proper stent attachment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, to date, there are no clinical studies comparing the POT SIDE POT technique with&#xD;
      that of KISSING-BALLOON in coronary bifurcation angioplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is why we would like to compare these two post-dilation techniques by a retrospective&#xD;
      study on the occurrence of major cardiovascular events and stent thrombosis in patients who&#xD;
      received a coronary bifurcation angioplasty in 2017 at the University Hospital of Nîmes.&#xD;
