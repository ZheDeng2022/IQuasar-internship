  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will include patients with invasive cervical cancer that wish to keep their&#xD;
      fertility as much as possible in the future after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who receive surgery alone may experience long-term side effects including&#xD;
      infertility. The purpose of this research study is to determine whether giving neo-adjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy prior to surgery can maintain fertility in patients with invasive cervical&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The neo-adjuvant chemotherapy will consist of a platinum-based chemotherapy drug cisplatin or&#xD;
      carboplatin, with a chemotherapy drug called paclitaxel. These are common chemotherapy drugs&#xD;
      used in the treatment of women with cervical cancers.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All participants will first receive neo-adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy. Once the&#xD;
      neo-adjuvant chemotherapy has been completed, participants will be assessed by imaging scans&#xD;
      to see whether they have a response to the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participants are responding to treatment, they will then have a trachelectomy. After&#xD;
      surgery, participants will be assessed and the study doctor will determine whether adjuvant&#xD;
      treatment is needed. Adjuvant treatment may include chemotherapy and radiotherapy, or have a&#xD;
      hysterectomy done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participants do not respond to or their disease worsens after neo-adjuvant treatment,&#xD;
      participants will receive adjuvant treatment with chemotherapy and radiotherapy or have a&#xD;
      hysterectomy done.&#xD;
