             provided IRB approved written informed consent. Subjects ages 12 to 17 years of age&#xD;
             inclusive must have provided IRB approved written assent; this written assent must be&#xD;
             accompanied by an IRB approved written informed consent from the Subject's legally&#xD;
             acceptable representative (i.e., parent or guardian). In addition, all Subjects or&#xD;
             their legally acceptable representatives (i.e., parent or guardian) must sign a HIPAA&#xD;
             authorization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects must have a minimum ≥ 25 non-inflammatory lesions (i.e., open and closed&#xD;
             comedones) AND ≥ 20 inflammatory lesions (i.e., papules and pustules) AND ≤ 2&#xD;
             nodulocystic lesions (i.e., nodules and cysts), at baseline on the face. For the&#xD;
             purposes of study treatment and evaluation, these lesions should be limited to the&#xD;
             facial treatment area. All lesions will be counted, including those present on the&#xD;
             nose. Subjects may have acne lesions on other areas of the body which will also be&#xD;
             excluded from the count, treatment, and the Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA)&#xD;
             evaluation (e.g., on the back, chest and arms).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects must have a definite clinical diagnosis of acne vulgaris of severity grade 2,&#xD;
             3, or 4 as per the Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA).&#xD;

&#xD;
          6. Female Subjects of childbearing potential (excluding women who are premenarchal,&#xD;
             surgically sterilized or postmenopausal for at least 1 year), in addition to having a&#xD;
             negative urine pregnancy test, must be willing to use an acceptable form of birth&#xD;
             control during the study from the day of the first dose administration to 30 days&#xD;
             after the last administration of study drug . For the purpose of this study the&#xD;
             following are considered acceptable methods of birth control: oral or injectable&#xD;

             barrier methods (e.g. condom and spermicide),Intrauterine Device (IUD), Essure, or&#xD;
             abstinence. If a subject who was abstinent becomes sexually active during the study, a&#xD;
             2nd acceptable method of birth control should be documented. A sterile sexual partner&#xD;
             is NOT considered an adequate form of birth control. Hormonal contraceptives should&#xD;
