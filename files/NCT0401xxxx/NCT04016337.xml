  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During last decades, an excessive intake of sugars has been observed in westernized&#xD;
      countries, mainly due to the consumption of sugar-rich soft drinks. Epidemiological studies&#xD;
      have pointed out a positive correlation between the consumption of such drinks and the risk&#xD;
      of obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, there is a growing trend&#xD;
      looking for new non-caloric alternatives (sweeteners) in order to reduce the sugar content of&#xD;
      foodstuffs without losing their sweetness and tastefulness. However, some questions regarding&#xD;
      sweeteners have recently arisen as their effects after long-term consumption have not been&#xD;
      fully unravelled. They could also contribute to a higher caloric intake and to disrupt the&#xD;
      gut microbiota. Besides seeking new alternatives for the high intake of sugar-rich drinks,&#xD;
      there is a need for increasing the consumption of fruits and vegetables among general public.&#xD;
      Developing new products to stretch the shelf-life of fresh fruits, preserving their&#xD;
      nutrients, and reducing the energetic content of fruit juices should also be accomplished. In&#xD;
      this sense, lemon juice has been proposed as an interesting ingredient in the elaboration of&#xD;
      soft drinks due to its distinctive aroma and high nutritive value. Its combination with maqui&#xD;
      berry juices contributes to stabilize the colour and phenolic compounds that both products&#xD;
      contain (mainly flavanones for lemon juice and anthocyanins for maqui). The beneficial&#xD;
      effects of these vegetal foodstuffs and their phenolic substances on glucose intolerance have&#xD;
      been reported.The aim of BEBESANO is studying the beneficial effects of sugar-free,&#xD;
      rich-in-phytochemicals drink consumption on postprandial hyperglycaemia, in order to provide&#xD;
      alternatives to excessive sugar intake and counteract the postprandial response linked to&#xD;
      sugar consumption in subjects with low levels of chronic inflammation such as overweight&#xD;
      people. Moreover, BEBESANO will shed light on the interactions of food constituents with the&#xD;
      main pathways involved in the lipid and glucose metabolism, oxidative stress, inflammation,&#xD;
      and hormonal regulation in overweight population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The effect of the consumption of fruit-based drinks, sweetened and rich in bioactive&#xD;
      compounds has been evaluated in acute and chronic clinical studies. They have been carried&#xD;
      out at the Catholic University of Murcia, in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration of&#xD;
      Human Studies and approved by the official Ethical Committee of Clinical Studies (CEIC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants were informed on the characteristics of the study and they signed the&#xD;
      written-informed consent. Dietetic and life style habits were recorded from all participants.&#xD;
      There were no drop-outs during the whole period of the study and no adverse effects were&#xD;
      reported. Safety clinical parameters (hepatic enzymes, renal function) were measured as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute study The acute study has determined markers of intake such as metabolites generated&#xD;
      from ingested polyphenolic compounds, as well as markers of effect, such as markers of&#xD;
      inflammatory processes, oxidative stress, glycemic and lipid homeostasis and hormones.&#xD;
      Specifically, the analysis of incretines in plasma using LC-MS techniques has been included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A double-blind, randomized, cross-over clinical study has been conducted in a population of&#xD;
      20 overweight individuals. After an initial phase of 3 days of wash-out with a strict diet&#xD;
      free of polyphenols and added sugars, 330 mL of the problem drink was administered on fasting&#xD;
      conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Drink made with lemon and maqui and sweetened with saccharose&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Drink made with lemon and maqui and sweetened with sucralose&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Drink made with lemon and maqui and sweetened with stevia&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples were then taken at various times (0, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 210 minutes). Urine&#xD;
      samples were collected 24 hours earlier (0 point) as well as in 0-4, 4-8, 8-12, 12-24 h&#xD;
      tranches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 7 days, the process was repeated again, for each volunteer to take another drink, until&#xD;
      all the drinks were consumed by all the volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic study Prolonged consumption of beverages over several weeks will allow the later&#xD;
      modification markers, such as parameters related to inflammation or oxidative status and&#xD;
      long-term hormonal response, to be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial is randomized, double-blind, parallel, with 3 groups of 46 subjects each. The&#xD;
      groups were randomized stratified by sex, BMI, and age. Recruitment has taken place at&#xD;
      various Health Centers and at UCAM. Those who are able to participate have been informed of&#xD;
      the study and asked to sign informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study includes beverages already studied in acute intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Drink made with lemon and maqui and sweetened with saccharose&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Drink made with lemon and maqui and sweetened with sucralose&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Drink made with lemon and maqui and sweetened with stevia&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were advised not to change their dietary habits during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each individual was given a type of drink (330 mL/day) for 60 days. Blood samples were taken,&#xD;
      as well as 24h-urine, at day 0 and at the end of the study (60 days), to perform the various&#xD;
      assessments.&#xD;
