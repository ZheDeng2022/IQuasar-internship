    <textblock>
      DREAM-03 is an early phase-1, open label study to compare the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK),&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics (PD), and acceptability of 3 sequences of tenofovir (TFV) and non-medicated&#xD;
      douches. The overall goal is to inform the design of an extended safety study of an on-demand&#xD;
      and behaviorally congruent TFV douche to confer protection from HIV acquisition in an&#xD;
      outpatient pre-RAI context.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      On demand and behaviorally-congruent forms of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) have long&#xD;
      been demanded by communities at great risk of HIV, especially men who have sex with men&#xD;
      (MSM). The DREAM Program is developing a tenofovir (TFV) douche for on demand PrEP use prior&#xD;
      to receptive anal intercourse (RAI), given that the vast majority of MSM very commonly douche&#xD;
      prior to RAI (behaviorally-congruent). DREAM-01 established a range of safe and acceptable&#xD;
      TFV rectal douche formulations administered as a single dose which also achieved desired&#xD;
      tissue concentrations of drug. DREAM Behavioral Survey data established that a series of 3&#xD;
      cleansing douches are typical prior to RAI in MSM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To more closely simulate actual douching practice prior to RAI, the investigators propose the&#xD;
      study of 3 douche product sequences to approximate the highest (3 TFV douches [Sequence A])&#xD;
      and lowest (only one TFV douche at the beginning [Sequence B] or end [Sequence C] of 2 other&#xD;
      non-medicated douches) number of TFV doses in a typical repeated cleansing douche sequence.&#xD;
      Study objectives including safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and&#xD;
      acceptability of repeated douching with TFV and non-medicated solutions, are essential to&#xD;
      inform the design of an extended safety study of a TFV douche in outpatient pre-RAI contexts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DREAM-03 is an early phase 1, open label study to compare the safety, PK, PD, and&#xD;
      acceptability of 3 sequences of TFV and non-medicated douches. Each participant will undergo&#xD;
      a Screening Visit to evaluate eligibility. Baseline Visit will assess pre-dose safety, PK,&#xD;
      PD, and behavioral points of reference. Three sequences described above (Sequences A, B, and&#xD;
      C) occur sequentially within each subject. Safety, PK, PD, and behavioral readouts are&#xD;
      assessed at specified times over 8 hours after each dose, followed by a minimum 14 day&#xD;
      washout period before the next sequence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TFV douche to be used, previously known as Product C from the DREAM-01 study, consists of&#xD;
      TFV 660 mg in 125 mL half-normal saline (TFV 5.28 mg/mL). Sequence A includes 3 TFV douches&#xD;
      and sequence B and C include only one TFV douche at the beginning or the end, respectively.&#xD;
      In sequence B and C the other douches (2 per sequence) will be non-medicated solutions (tap&#xD;
      water). Sequence A, proportional accumulation of all 3 TFV douches, would represent a 3-fold&#xD;
      increase in TFV dose relative to the highest single dose used in DREAM-01 (Product C, 660&#xD;
      mg/125 mL half-normal saline [TFV 5.28 mg/mL]). Sequence B and C, with only 1 TFV douche dose&#xD;
      either preceded by or following two non-medicated douches, are expected to exceed the tissue&#xD;
      exposure of the lowest dose used in DREAM-01 (Product A, TFV 220 mg/125 mL normal saline).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant accrual will take approximately 6 months and each participant will be on study&#xD;
      for approximately 6 months. Total study duration is about 1 year.&#xD;

    <description>To analyze study product sequence acceptability, the outcome will be examined in both continuous and dichotomous forms. For each sequence, descriptive statistics of overall acceptability will be generated (i.e., mean and standard deviation for continuous variables and proportion of subjects who consider the sequences acceptable -- with score 3 or greater). The acceptability of each sequence is defined as a mean score of 3 on 4-point continuous acceptability measure (1=completely unacceptable; 2=somewhat unacceptable; 3=somewhat acceptable; 4=highly acceptable) that is defined in this study as the minimal clinically meaningful threshold for sequence acceptability.
