  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aging is associated with impairments in cognitive function, particularly motor learning and&#xD;
      memorizing, impacting functional capacities. Older adults are still able to learn new skills&#xD;
      but at a slower rate, and they forget quickly the new-learned skill because of an alteration&#xD;
      in motor memory. Motor imagery, which is a mental simulation of an action without actual&#xD;
      execution, has been demonstrated to improve performance in young adults and stabilize&#xD;
      performance after a short break in older adults. However, in very old adults (&gt;80 years old)&#xD;
      for whom the decline in motor and cognitive functions is greater, it is unknown whether motor&#xD;
      imagery training during a short break is still efficient. Previous studies on old adults were&#xD;
      performed on upper limb muscles. Because aging differentially affects upper and lower limb&#xD;
      muscles, the present study will aim to explore the effects of motor imagery on motor&#xD;
      memorizing in both upper and lower limb muscles.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose is to evaluate the effectiveness of motor imagery to improve the&#xD;
      performance of very old people (&gt; 80 years) through learning a task of the upper limbs.&#xD;
