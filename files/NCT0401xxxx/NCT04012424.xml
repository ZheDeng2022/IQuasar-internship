      Will premedication with Curcumin in single endodontic treatment in patients having acute&#xD;
      pulpitis in mandibular molars affect post- operative pain?&#xD;
&#xD;
      This the present study hopes to bring an evidence based decision on the possibility of using&#xD;
      curcumin as a premedication to reduce post-operative pain in single visit treatment of cases&#xD;
      with acute pulpitis&#xD;

      The diagnostic data will be collected in a general health chart and dental history sheet by&#xD;
      the investigator and confirmed for eligibility criteria with main supervisor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical examination through visual, palpation and percussion of offending tooth is done.&#xD;
      Pulp sensitivity test will be done for baseline comparison. It will be performed by both by&#xD;
      electric and thermal tests on offending tooth and the contralateral. Preoperative periapical&#xD;
      radiograph is done to evaluate pulp chamber size and shape, root and root canals and detect&#xD;
      any per apical changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The selected mandibular molars should have final diagnosis of acute pulpitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnostic criteria for acute pulpitis tooth:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Palpation test: not sensitive &amp; Percussion test: not sensitive &amp;Thermal test: hypersensitive&#xD;
      to heat or cold &amp; Radiographic: periapical radiograph shows normal periapex • Sequence of&#xD;
      procedural steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study protocol is described to the patients and they sign an informed consent . Each&#xD;
      patient will be given pain scale chart (VAS) in order to record his /her pain level before&#xD;
      any intervention, and then patients will be given the premedication according to the study&#xD;
      group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A&quot; intervention or Curcumin group &quot;: (400mg Curcumin) in one capsule Group B&quot; placebo&#xD;
      group &quot;: starch capsule, Both capsules of intervention and placebo groups will have the same&#xD;
      shape, color and are prepared by Professor Doctor Mohamed Elnabarawy in the faculty of&#xD;
      pharmacology, Cairo University. Every patient takes one capsule before endodontic treatment&#xD;
      by one hour according to randomization sequence table prepared by the main supervisor&#xD;
      utilizing &quot;random.org&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researcher will give nerve block anesthesia according to the region of the tooth will be&#xD;
      treated, ARTINIBSA 4% articaine hydrochloride 4% with 1:100,000 epinephrine as&#xD;
      vasoconstrictor will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An access cavity is performed by using round bur and endo-z bur, afterwards. The tooth will&#xD;
      be properly isolated with rubber dam. Irrigation is done with 2ml 2.5% Sodium hypochlorite&#xD;
      (Clorox, Nobelwax Factories for chemicals, Egypt) , then canal negotiation with K-file #15&#xD;
      (K-file, Dentsply Maillefer , Switzerland), and working length will be determined using an&#xD;
      electronic apex locator (iPex NSK,Japan) and confirmed radiographically, sequentionaly larger&#xD;
      file sizes will be introduced to the working length to gague the initional apical file size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mechanical preparation will be performed by crown-down technique using rotary M-Pro files, in&#xD;
      an endodontic motor (Endo mate, NSK, Japan) with adjusted torque and speed according to the&#xD;
      manufacturer's instructions ( 450 rpm -1.5 Ncm). Gauging apical diameter will be done with&#xD;
      manual files to determine the master apical file size. If necessary; further larger apical&#xD;
      preparation will be done with by manual files. The rotary files will be introduced inside the&#xD;
      canal lubricated with EDTA Cream (MD-Chelcream, META BIOMED CO, Korea) The canals are&#xD;
      thoroughly irrigated using 2.5% NaOCl between every subsequent instrument by using side&#xD;
      vented needle, 27 gauge, with maximum depth of working length - 1mm. The irrigant is&#xD;
      delivered having 2ml volume at a rate 1ml/30 second.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Root canal is dried using sterile paper points corresponding to master cone size followed by&#xD;
      doing master cone periapical radiograph by ViVi, S.r.I, Italy- X-ray machine and intraoral&#xD;
      periapical Kodak Dental film, speed D, #2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obturation of the canals is done by lateral compaction technique and master cone cementated&#xD;
      by resin sealer (ADSEAL, META BIOMED CO., Korea). A spreader #30 will be used 2mm short of&#xD;
      working length to allow for auxiliary cones #25, taper 2% to be added and excess will be&#xD;
      removed with hot instrument up to cervical line followed by insertion of temporary filling to&#xD;
      seal the access cavity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative periapical radiograph is taken after obturation. Pain will be assessed by&#xD;
      giving the patient the pain scale (VAS) to assess pain immediately after treatment and at 8,&#xD;
      12,24,48 hours after the visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VAS pain scale is horizontal scale from1-100mm.patient mark on the scale and investigator&#xD;
      will measure with ruler and conert to cateigories as follow (0-40mm): no pain, (5-44mm) :&#xD;
      mild, (45-74mm): moderate,(75-100) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will come back at clinic after 48hours and deliver their signed scoring sheet and&#xD;
      referred to restorative department for permanent restoration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • In case of post appointment emergency cases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pain is recorded by pain scale and emergency treatment done according to pain severity;&#xD;
      recording of pain scale is continued according to schedule time line. Sequence of emergency&#xD;
      treatment includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Make sure the tooth is out of occlusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Hot saline mouth bath&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. When pain is moderate /severe: Anti- inflammatory: ibuprofen600 tab/8hr (6)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Antibiotics (is only prescribed in presence of swelling and/or systemic manifestations&#xD;
           as malaise or palpable lymph nodes or fever) Hibiotic 1gm tab/12hrs and Flagel 500 mg&#xD;
           tab/12 hrs for 5 days N.B if allergic to penicillin; Dalacin C 300 mg cap/8hrs for 5days&#xD;
