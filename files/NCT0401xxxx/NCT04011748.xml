  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alopecia areata (AA) is a common autoimmune disease that results in loss of body hair in&#xD;
      varying degrees. The condition is estimated to affect more than 6.5 million people in the&#xD;
      United States alone (naaf.org), with a worldwide prevalence of 0.1% to 0.2% and calculated&#xD;
      lifetime risk of 2%. AA is the most common form of the disease, in which areas of complete&#xD;
      hair loss arise within normal hair-bearing skin. Other forms include alopecia totalis (AT),&#xD;
      characterized by total loss of scalp hair, and alopecia universalis (AU), characterized by&#xD;
      complete loss of body hair. AA and its variants can have devastating effects on patients'&#xD;
      quality of life and social functioning. At present, curative therapy for AA does not exist.&#xD;
      Therapeutic options are currently very limited, such as intralesional injections of&#xD;
      glucocorticoids and induction of allergic contact dermatitis. These therapies are not&#xD;
      effective for many patients and are generally impractical for patients with diffuse AA, AT or&#xD;
      AU. Recently, Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors were effective for the treatment of severe AA.&#xD;
      However, for those patients who do respond, relapses are common after discontinuation of&#xD;
      treatment, due to the existing of autoimmune memory T cells. Stem Cell Educator (SCE)&#xD;
      therapy, which uses only autologous mononuclear cells that are externally exposed to cord&#xD;
      blood stem cells, has previously been proven safe and effective in subjects for the&#xD;
      improvement of type 1 diabetes (T1D), T2D and other autoimmune diseases such as alopecia&#xD;
      areata. Minoxidil is the FDA approved drug for the treatment of androgenetic alopecia (AGA)&#xD;
      in 1988. This trial will explore the therapeutic potential of Stem Cell Educator therapy for&#xD;
      the treatment of AA in combined with oral minoxidil.&#xD;
