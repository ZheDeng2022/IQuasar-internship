  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study was to assess the effect of repeated oral doses of&#xD;
      Rifampicin on the pharmacokinetic profile of a single dose of Fluzoparib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective of the study was to assess the safety of Fluzoparib given alone&#xD;
      versus Fluzoparib coadministered with Rifampicin.&#xD;
