      Mechanical ventilation is the first artificial support used in intensive care. After a period&#xD;
      of invasive mechanical ventilation, patients should be separated from the ventilator (weaning&#xD;
      period of mechanical ventilation). If weaning and extubation (removal of the tracheal tube)&#xD;
      are successful in approximately 80 to 90% of resuscitation patients, 10 to 20% will develop&#xD;
      acute respiratory failure (ARF) in the days following extubation. Obesity concerns 20 to 30%&#xD;
      of resuscitation admissions in France. The pathophysiological changes in the obese patient&#xD;
      explain the over-risk of desaturation and ARF in the post-extubation period. In order to&#xD;
      decrease the incidence of extubation failure (need for reintubation within 48-72h&#xD;
      post-extubation) of the most fragile patients, it is recommended in intensive care unit to&#xD;
      prophylactically use various ventilatory support strategies and / or oxygenation, among which&#xD;
      noninvasive ventilation (NIV) and oxygen therapy, which can be administered in two ways:&#xD;
      High-Flow Humidified Nasal Oxygen Therapy (HFNO) or standard oxygen therapy. These strategies&#xD;
      have never been compared in the obese post-extubation critically ill patient. Our hypothesis&#xD;
      is that NIV is superior to oxygen to prevent the development of ARF in obese extubated&#xD;
      patients in intensive care unit.&#xD;

      Mechanical ventilation is the first artificial support used in intensive care unit (ICU).&#xD;
      After a period of invasive mechanical ventilation, patients should be separated from the&#xD;
      ventilator (weaning period of mechanical ventilation). If weaning and extubation (removal of&#xD;
      the tracheal intubation tube) is successful in approximately 80 to 90% of resuscitation&#xD;
      patients, 10 to 20% will develop acute respiratory failure (ARF) in the days following&#xD;
      extubation . This incidence is higher in the patients most fragile in the respiratory field&#xD;
      (obese patients, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), elderly, heart failure,&#xD;
      postoperative cardio-thoracic and / or abdominal surgery ...) . The management of&#xD;
      post-extubation ARF consists of etiological treatment associated with ventilatory support&#xD;
      which usually requires the use of new endotracheal intubation to deliver &quot;invasive&quot;&#xD;
      artificial ventilation. This invasive ventilation is responsible for excess morbidity and&#xD;
      excess mortality . Therefore, it is fundamental for the physician to prevent by all means the&#xD;
      occurrence of ARF post-extubation. One of the most important causes of extubation failure is&#xD;
      the imbalance between the burden imposed on the respiratory system and its ability to&#xD;
      overcome it, leading to gas exchange abnormalities, namely hypoxia and hypercapnia. Ensuring&#xD;
      adequate oxygenation is therefore essential after extubation. In ICU, oxygen therapy is&#xD;
      commonly used to improve and provide adequate oxygenation .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obesity, a major public health problem in the industrialized countries, concerns 10 to 20% of&#xD;
      resuscitation admissions in France. It is associated with excess morbidity and longer&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation time compared to the general population. Effect on mortality is&#xD;
      controversial , some studies suggesting a protective or neutral effect of obesity , named&#xD;
      &quot;obesity paradox&quot; . At the ventilatory level, several pathophysiological changes are combined&#xD;
      and contribute to an increase in the incidence of respiratory complications . Pulmonary&#xD;
      volumes are amputated, the Body Mass Index (BMI) being negatively correlated with the&#xD;
      functional residual capacity and vital capacity. The compliance of the respiratory system is&#xD;
      reduced by the weight of the chest wall. Decreased compliance and increased airway resistance&#xD;
      lead to increased respiratory muscle work. All of these pathophysiological changes in the&#xD;
      obese patient explain the over-risk of desaturation and ARF in the post-extubation period. In&#xD;
      addition to the intrinsic risk factors associated with obesity, the post-extubation period is&#xD;
      marked by numerous risk factors for the development of ARF and extubation failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the exploration of different modern modalities of adequate post-extubation oxygen&#xD;
      therapy in obese resuscitation patients to prevent the occurrence of extubation failure or&#xD;
      post-extubation ARF has never been studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For over 20 years, Non-Invasive Ventilation (NIV) has been an essential modality in the&#xD;
      prevention (&quot;preventive NIV&quot;) and management (&quot;curative NIV&quot;) of respiratory failure in ICU.&#xD;
      The advantages of this ventilation modality are: respect for airway defense mechanisms&#xD;
      (speech and cough maintenance), elimination of laryngeal and tracheal trauma induced by an&#xD;
      intubation tube, improved comfort, reduction of the risk of bronchopulmonary nosocomial&#xD;
      infection .&#xD;
&#xD;
      An alternative to NIV is the simple administration of oxygen. Two devices delivering low&#xD;
      oxygen flows are commonly used for oxygen therapy after extubation: the Venturi mask and the&#xD;
      nasal cannulas. The nasal cannulas are preferred by patients and less likely to be removed,&#xD;
      but they can cause discomfort due to dryness of nasal mucosa when oxygen flows greater than 4&#xD;
      L/min are used. The Venturi mask delivers predetermined oxygen concentrations ranging from 24&#xD;
      to 60%, but the mask is generally less comfortable than the nasal cannula and more likely to&#xD;
      be displaced or removed . In clinical practice, the Venturi mask is more frequently used&#xD;
      after extubation because critically ill patients breathe preferentially through an open mouth&#xD;
      rather than the nose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More recently, a new oxygen therapy device has been marketed. This device (OptiflowÂ®, Fisher&#xD;
      &amp; Paykel, New Zealand) of High Flow Nasal Humidified Oxygen Therapy (HFNO) is able to deliver&#xD;
      oxygen humidified by nasal cannulas. This system has several theoretical advantages: high&#xD;
      flow rates reduce the dilution of inhaled oxygen and allow precise distribution of FiO2&#xD;
      throughout the inspiratory phase by adapting the peak flow rate to the patient. The high&#xD;
      oxygen flow can also have a washing effect on the dead space of the nasopharynx. In addition,&#xD;
      a flow-dependent effect helps to generate a continuous positive end-expiratory pressure&#xD;
      (PEEP) , related to an air entrainment mechanism, which has been documented in healthy&#xD;
      volunteers and COPD patients. Finally, the use of a high level of humidity could prevent&#xD;
      alterations of the ciliated epithelium of the respiratory tract, maintain the activity of the&#xD;
      muco-ciliary system, and facilitate the elimination of secretions . In a study in non-obese&#xD;
      patients, HFNO was shown to improve oxygenation compared to the Venturi mask, while reducing&#xD;
      respiratory rate, PaCO2 and discomfort in patients receiving oxygen therapy after extubation.&#xD;
      These positive effects of HFNO were associated with less interface displacement and less&#xD;
      oxygen desaturations than the Venturi mask. A secondary result was that the need for&#xD;
      reintubation at 48 h was lower with HFNO than with the Venturi mask (4% vs 21%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, in order to decrease the incidence of extubation failure (need for reintubation&#xD;
      within 48-72h post-extubation) of the most fragile patients (including obese patients), it is&#xD;
      recommended in intensive care unit to prophylactically use various ventilatory support&#xD;
      strategies and / or oxygenation, among which:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  NIV which allows to deliver an established level of oxygen delivered via ventilatory&#xD;
           assistance using two levels of pressure (inspiratory aid + positive expiratory&#xD;
           pressure), but intermittently, with duration of sessions dependent on the tolerance of&#xD;
           the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oxygen therapy, which can be administered in two ways: HFNO or standard oxygen therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2 Knowledge gap and research hypothesis In an observational study of 124 patients, EL Sohl&#xD;
      et al. compared NIV to standard oxygen to prevent extubation failure, and showed a 16%&#xD;
      absolute risk reduction of ARF using NIV compared to standard oxygen following extubation. In&#xD;
      155 post cardiac surgery obese patients, Corley et al. compared HFNO and standard oxygen to&#xD;
      prevent extubation failure, without showing any difference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, none of these studies compared simultaneously the most recent devices available:&#xD;
      NIV, HFNO and standard oxygen, nor their association. HFNO is now often used, and the PEP&#xD;
      issued by HFNO is much lower than that issued by the NIV. The opening of the cells and the&#xD;
      probable maintenance of the residual functional capacity is less when using HFNO than NIV.&#xD;
      Thus, the two oxygenation methods (NIV and HFNO) appear complementary in case of ARF&#xD;
      following extubation in obese patients. The benefit of NIV +/- HFNO compared to oxygen&#xD;
      (standard oxygen or HFNO) to improve the quality of post-extubation oxygenation of overall&#xD;
      ICU obese patients has never been studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this multicenter, randomized, controlled, interventional study in mechanically ventilated&#xD;
      obese critically ill patients, we will test the hypothesis that NIV (associated to HFNO or&#xD;
      standard oxygen) is superior to oxygen (HFNO or standard oxygen) to prevent the development&#xD;
      of ARF in obese extubated patients in intensive care unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.3 Originality and innovative aspects of the study NIV has proven effective in small&#xD;
      observational studies in preventing ARF following extubation of obese patients, in ICU or&#xD;
      postoperative setting. The control group was standard oxygen therapy, which was the standard&#xD;
      of care a few years ago. Nowadays, HFNO is more and more used, and has proven to be&#xD;
      non-inferior to NIV in ARF patients following cardiothoracic surgery and in high risk&#xD;
      patients after extubation in the ICU. To date no prospective randomized study has compared&#xD;
      NIV (alternated with HFNO or standard oxygen) with oxygen therapy (HFNO or standard oxygen)&#xD;
      to prevent extubation failure in obese patients. This study would be the first to compare the&#xD;
      association of the most recent advances in term of oxygenation and lung recruitment in&#xD;
      critically ill patients: NIV, HFNO and standard oxygen.&#xD;
