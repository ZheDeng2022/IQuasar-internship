      Comparing the cost-effectiveness and safety of additional low-dose glucocorticoid in&#xD;
      treatment strategies for elderly patients with rheumatoid arthritis:&#xD;

      The Glucocorticoid Low-dose Outcome in RheumatoId Arthritis Study (GLORIA)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a condition with high impact both on the individual&#xD;
      and society. In the context of comparing the effectiveness of existing healthcare&#xD;
      interventions in the elderly, RA is a condition highly relevant to the community since it has&#xD;
      a strongly negative impact on the quality of life of the individual, is particularly frequent&#xD;
      in the elderly, and is associated with significant costs. RA management remains challenging:&#xD;
      there is an urgent unmet medical and societal need for improved treatment strategies that are&#xD;
      effective, safe and affordable. Evidence based information on the glucocorticoid (GC)&#xD;
      harm/benefit balance will have a high impact on RA treatment strategies and on treatment&#xD;
      strategies for the many other inflammatory disorders for which GCs are considered. The&#xD;
      Glucocorticoid Low-dose Outcome in RheumatoId Arthritis Study (GLORIA) is a 5-year project&#xD;
      funded by the European Commission under the Horizon 2020 Program, designed to address these&#xD;
      needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The primary objectives of the GLORIA project are twofold:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the effectiveness, safety and cost-effectiveness of low-dose GC therapy (5&#xD;
           mg/day) compared to placebo given for two years as co-treatment for elderly RA patients&#xD;
           (≥ 65 years) in a pragmatic randomized trial;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess study medication adherence through a medication packaging solution, and test&#xD;
           the effectiveness of smart device technology to improve adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other objectives of the GLORIA project are: to deliver an outcome prediction model for&#xD;
      individual patient outcome, to tailor treatment strategies for elderly RA patients with&#xD;
      comorbidities; and deliver data to support:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. better guidelines on RA treatment in the elderly;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. more accurate information for elderly RA patients, their physicians and researchers;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. improved strategies for trial design and conduct in the elderly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: The GLORIA study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pragmatic&#xD;
      multicenter clinical trial to assess the effectiveness and safety of a daily dose of 5 mg&#xD;
      prednisolone or matching placebo in elderly RA patients. Patients will be randomized into two&#xD;
      arms: the experimental arm (receiving prednisolone 5 mg/day) or the control arm (receiving&#xD;
      placebo). The design emulates the routine care setting: eligibility criteria are very&#xD;
      liberal, assessments and procedures are tailored to represent standard of care, and&#xD;
      concurrent antirheumatic treatment is allowed next to the trial medication with minimal&#xD;
      limitations. Furthermore, all patients will have an adherence monitoring device loaded into&#xD;
      the cap of the drug bottle; adherence data will be monitored throughout the trial. In&#xD;
      addition, to test the effect of adherence reminders, a substudy (another trial) will be&#xD;
      nested in the main GLORIA trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Substudy design: The substudy is limited to patients with a smart device (smartphone, tablet,&#xD;
      etc) who have completed at least 3 months of the main study on treatment. The experimental&#xD;
      arm of the substudy will receive an application loaded onto their smart device that&#xD;
      communicates with an adherence monitoring device loaded into the cap of the drug bottle and&#xD;
      delivers reminders to improve adherence. The control arm of the substudy will not have this&#xD;
      application and reminders. The substudy has a duration of three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Patients of 65 years of age and older with RA according to the 1987 or the&#xD;
      2010 classification criteria of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and the European&#xD;
      League Against Rheumatism (EULAR), requiring antirheumatic therapy because of inadequate&#xD;
      disease control, as evidenced by a disease activity score of 28 joints calculated with&#xD;
      erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28) ≥2.60.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Substudy population: Patients in the main study who have completed at least 3 months on&#xD;
      treatment, in possession of and familiar with a smart device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: In this two-armed clinical trial, patients will be randomized to either the&#xD;
      experimental arm or the control arm. The experimental arm will receive prednisolone 5 mg/day&#xD;
      added to existing antirheumatic treatment. The control arm will receive matching placebo&#xD;
      added to existing antirheumatic treatment. Treatment duration is two years per patient.&#xD;
      Subsequently, study drug is tapered in linear fashion to zero in 6 weeks by inserting&#xD;
      increasing numbers of non-treatment days. Patients experiencing a flare at that time can&#xD;
      restart open label prednisolone at the discretion of the treating rheumatologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Co-interventions: As part of standard of care all patients will receive Calcium 500&#xD;
      mg/Vitamin D3 800 IU. Besides the study medication, almost all treatment is allowed; both&#xD;
      treatment for comorbidities, as well as antirheumatic treatment. This includes biologic and&#xD;
      nonbiologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      drugs (NSAIDs), short term oral or parental GCs for comorbidities and acetaminophen. However,&#xD;
      it is advised not to start other antirheumatic therapy (DMARD, biologic) or give&#xD;
      intra-articular or intramuscular GC injections, especially not in the first 3 months, but it&#xD;
      is allowed if clinically judged as unavoidable. In such cases, preferred administration is at&#xD;
      baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Substudy intervention: All patients will have an adherence monitoring device loaded into the&#xD;
      cap of the drug bottle that will be equipped with a wireless transmitter, which not only&#xD;
      tracks adherence but can also communicate real time with a smart device of the patient&#xD;
      (smartphone, tablet, etc.), through special software to remind patients of the time of&#xD;
      medication. In the substudy, patients with a smart device will receive an application loaded&#xD;
      on their smart device that communicates with the adherence monitoring device loaded into the&#xD;
      cap of the drug bottle. The app sends a reminder message to the patient when it's time to&#xD;
      take the medication and in case of non-adherence the app also sends an alert message to&#xD;
      inform the patient he or she has forgotten to take the medication. Eligible patients will be&#xD;
      randomized to either the experimental arm that receive reminders on their smart device, or to&#xD;
      the control arm that will not receive reminders, for a period of 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure benefit, primary endpoints are a) signs and symptoms: the time-averaged mean&#xD;
           value (estimated from linear mixed models) of the DAS28; b) damage progression: change&#xD;
           from baseline after 2-years in total Sharp/van der Heijde damage score of hands and&#xD;
           forefeet radiographs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure safety, the primary endpoint is the total number of patients experiencing at&#xD;
           least one serious adverse event, or one clinical event related to the disease or its&#xD;
           therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other major outcomes are cost-effectiveness, cost-utility, and medication adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment takes place at varying intervals, and includes seven clinic visits and 3&#xD;
      assessments by telephone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: GLORIA is a pragmatic trial, with measurements that are almost all part of&#xD;
      standard of care, and therefore there are no additional risks associated with these&#xD;
      measurements. However, the intervention in this trial is that patients are randomized to&#xD;
      either standard of care with low-dose GCs or standard of care without low-dose GCs for a&#xD;
      duration of two years. It is known that GCs have strong favorable effects on disease&#xD;
      activity, of which patients randomised to the control arm (placebo) cannot benefit. However,&#xD;
      side effects of GCs are known as well, and patients in the experimental arm (prednisone 5&#xD;
      mg/day) might suffer from them. Although side effects predominantly occur when GC are used in&#xD;
      high doses for long periods of time, elderly are more likely to suffer from adverse effects&#xD;
      of the disease and its therapy than younger patients. However, elderly are underrepresented&#xD;
      or even excluded from many clinical trials, so it is difficult to estimate their risk: this&#xD;
      forms the rationale for the trial. To reduce risks, participants are monitored and patients&#xD;
      with a low probability of benefit and patients with a high probability of harm will be&#xD;
      excluded from participation to this trial. For the substudy to measure adherence through an&#xD;
      innovative application, no additional risks are expected: if the application appears to be&#xD;
      successful, patients randomised to the intervention can only benefit from it since it&#xD;
      improves their medication adherence; in case the application is not successful, for patients&#xD;
      not randomised to the application or for patients without a smart device, no difference is&#xD;
      expected with the 'normal' situation, in which patients do not have access to an adherence&#xD;
      application.&#xD;
