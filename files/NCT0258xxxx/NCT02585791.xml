      This aim will examine the acute and subacute exposures to electronic cigarette (EC) vapor&#xD;
      generated from e-liquids without nicotine (NFEC) on life-time non smokers subjects by&#xD;
      measuring changes in nasal ion transport and TGF-β levels. Nasal ion transport will be&#xD;
      assessed by nasal potential difference (NPD). Tumor growth factor (TGF)-β levels (mRNA and&#xD;
      protein by ELISA) will be assessed on nasal cells and lavages.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The recent introduction of electronic cigarettes (ECs) to provide habitual smokers a source&#xD;
      of nicotine without the need to inhale tobacco smoke is thought to reduce toxicity to airway&#xD;
      epithelial cells. The use of ECs decreases use of traditional cigarettes diminishes nicotine&#xD;
      withdrawal symptoms leads to opposite effects on exhaled NO levels compared to tobacco and&#xD;
      may diminish stimulation of reward centers in the brain leading to less dependence due to the&#xD;
      lack of other tobacco-derived chemicals. The manufacturers of ECs tout comparative safety as&#xD;
      a reason to switch from traditional tobacco cigarettes to their products. However the dearth&#xD;
      of data supporting this claim led the FDA to issue warning letters to these companies. For&#xD;
      now, the World Health Organization recommends against EC use until ECs have been properly&#xD;
      evaluated. On the other hand, the American Association of Public Health Physicians support&#xD;
      the use of ECs as a means of &quot;Harms Reduction&quot; since ECs provide nicotine without the myriad&#xD;
      of other toxic chemicals produced from burning tobacco. These recommendations are mostly due&#xD;
      to theoretical considerations and expert opinion. Due to the novelty of the ECs, many&#xD;
      concerns of their safety on health and long-term nicotine addiction remain unanswered due to&#xD;
      a lack of studies that comprehensively evaluate their toxicity in the airways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, ECs produce vapor mainly from propylene glycol (PG) or vegetable glycerin (VG) that&#xD;
      are blended at different concentrations, making comprehensive testing more difficult.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lack of consistent results demands a full evaluation of EC toxicity in the airway even&#xD;
      when nicotine is not inhaled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our laboratory using cultures of primary normal human bronchial epithelial(NHBE) cells&#xD;
      (either differentiating or fully differentiated) exposed to EC vapor or an equivalent volume&#xD;
      of filtered air we have demonstrated that EC vapor can be delivered to fully differentiated&#xD;
      NHBE cells and that high, but realistic puff numbers decrease ciliary beat frequency (CBF) as&#xD;
      well as Large, Ca2+-activated K+ channels (BK channel) (the pore forming α subunit KCNMA1)&#xD;
      and Forkhead box protein (FOXJ)-1 expression. We also have preliminary data of smoke exposure&#xD;
      in vitro and in vivo, showing a negative effect of cigarette smoke and nicotine on parameters&#xD;
      of mucociliary clearance (MCC) and nasal potential difference (NPD), a way to assess ion&#xD;
      transport in vivo. These changes occurred in a TGF-β-dependent manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to evaluate the airway toxicity of NFECs (Aim 2.1 of the project&#xD;
      &quot;Adverse effects of inhaled nicotine from tobacco and e-cigarettes&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY ENDPOINT As the primary endpoint, we will assess the consequences of vaping EC liquid&#xD;
      with no nicotine (NFEC) on cystic fibrosis transmembrane (CFTR)- and calcium-activated&#xD;
      chloride channel (CaCC)-mediated chloride conductance in lifetime non-smokers using nasal&#xD;
      potential difference (NPD) measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will use NPD as a primary endpoint because changes in most clinical parameters will only&#xD;
      be seen after months or even years of exposure. For that particular reason, there is a recent&#xD;
      surge to find alternative biomarkers that may be used as surrogate endpoints in shorter&#xD;
      clinical trials. Since NPD directly measures the changes in ion transport expected to&#xD;
      influence MCC and therefore overall outcome and since changes of NPD measurements are&#xD;
      indirectly linked to lung function changes and MCC in trials with cystic fibrosis (CF)&#xD;
      patients, we believe that NPD lends itself as a reasonable surrogate for MCC for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY ENDPOINTS Nasal nitric oxide and TGF-ß levels in nasal lavage and cells will be&#xD;
      also collected to correlate with the changes on NPD results after exposure to NFEC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN This aim will examine whether acute and subacute exposures to NFEC vapors have&#xD;
      adverse effects on lifetime non-smokers by measuring changes in nasal ion transport and TGF-β&#xD;
      levels. Nasal ion transport will be assessed by nasal potential difference (NPD), which&#xD;
      measures the voltage potential resulting from epithelial ion fluxes (both Na+ absorption and&#xD;
      Cl- and K+ secretion at the mucosal surface in vivo. In normal airway epithelia, Na+&#xD;
      absorption is the primary ion transport activity so that the resulting airway surface&#xD;
      potential difference is negative with reference to the interstitium. Ion transport across&#xD;
      nasal epithelia is representative for findings in distal airways. We also believe that NPD is&#xD;
      a reasonably sensitive biomarker for this study as discussed below. Therefore, we will&#xD;
      evaluate the acute effects of NFEC vapor generated from the nicotine-carrier system&#xD;
      (&quot;e-liquid&quot; without nicotine) and the subacute effect after a 7-days exposure to the NFEC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the major difference between the ECs is the amount of vapor produced per puff, we will&#xD;
      focus on a commonly used mini and mid-sized EC: Halo (The Halo company, USA) and eGo-T®&#xD;
      (Joyetech Co., Ltd., ShenZhen China), and examine different vapor fluids or &quot;e-liquids&quot; (100%&#xD;
      PG, 50% PG/50% VG and 100% VG) without nicotine.&#xD;
