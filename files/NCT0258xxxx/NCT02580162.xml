      This study evaluates and compares the efficacy of professional versus peer-based delivery of&#xD;
      family-based treatment for childhood overweight and obesity in elementary school aged&#xD;
      children. Families will be randomized to receive treatment from professionals or to receive&#xD;
      treatment from professionally-trained peer interventionists. Some parents will then be&#xD;
      invited to serve as peer interventionists for the next group of families.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The high prevalence of pediatric overweight and obesity in the U.S. necessitates the&#xD;
      development of efficacious, but cost-effective and easily disseminable interventions that&#xD;
      improve and sustain better pediatric weight outcomes. Accumulated evidence finds initial and&#xD;
      long-term efficacy of moderate-to-high intensity (&gt;25 contact hours) family-based treatment&#xD;
      (FBT) for elementary school-aged children, but such treatment is prohibitively expensive&#xD;
      because of high personnel costs (delivery by behavioral health professionals) and therefore&#xD;
      limited in availability, reach, and impact. Very few overweight/obese children receive&#xD;
      evidence-based treatment to improve their weight status or health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pilot data suggest a new model, peer-based delivery FBT with FBT-treated parents trained&#xD;
      and subsequently delivering FBT to other families, is feasible and demonstrates initial&#xD;
      efficacy. This delivery model could dramatically reduce FBT costs and increase FBT&#xD;
      availability. Preliminary data also suggest that serving as a peer interventionist may also&#xD;
      benefit the peers themselves and their children in better sustaining their own weight&#xD;
      outcomes. The present study aims to provide a more definitive test of the short- and&#xD;
      long-term efficacy of peer- versus professionally-delivered FBT on child weight outcomes.&#xD;
      Embedded in this comparison is an examination of the feasibility of peer-based FBT delivery,&#xD;
      investigating the impact of serving as a peer interventionist on the peers' own and their&#xD;
      child's long- term weight status, and a more comprehensive examination of differential costs&#xD;
      of professional- versus peer- based FBT delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study will also test potential dissemination and sustainability by examining the&#xD;
      efficacy of peer-delivered FBT among peer interventionists who themselves received FBT from&#xD;
      other peers and not from professional interventionists. Moderation of treatment outcome is&#xD;
      also examined, focusing on peer interventionist and child characteristics. This multi-phase&#xD;
      trial will enroll 304 families with 7-11 year old overweight/obese children in multiple sites&#xD;
      throughout the region, and include short-term (post-treatment) and long-term (up through 1&#xD;
      year after treatment cessation) assessments. This investigation of an innovative approach&#xD;
      that could significantly reduce FBT delivery costs, while also improving the maintenance of&#xD;
      treatment effects, is critical to improving the health of the many already overweight&#xD;
      children at risk for chronic disease.&#xD;
