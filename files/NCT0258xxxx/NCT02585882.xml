      This was a block-randomized, controlled, open-label trial and was executed in two preschools&#xD;
      in The Gambia. Fluoridated table salt (250 mg F/kg salt) was administered in daily communal&#xD;
      preschool feeding. In total, 304 children in the test group and 137 children in the control&#xD;
      group, aged 3 to 5 years were enrolled according to inclusion criteria (complete primary&#xD;
      dentition and a parental or legal guardian informed consent). Mean difference of incidence of&#xD;
      cavitated carious lesions (Δd3/4mft) after 12 months was the primary end point. The relative&#xD;
      preventive dental caries effect was. Secondary end points were the difference of incidence of&#xD;
      white spot lesions and the difference of incidence of total carious lesions.&#xD;

      Patients and Methods This was a block-randomized, controlled, open-label trial to evaluate&#xD;
      the relative caries preventive effect of fluoridated table salt in communal feeding of&#xD;
      preschool children after 12 months. The study protocol was approved by the Witten/Herdecke&#xD;
      University institutional review board (No. 106/2010) and by the Department of State for&#xD;
      Health and Social Welfare of the Republic of The Gambia in the form of a memorandum of&#xD;
      understanding. All participants and parents or legal guardians gave written informed consent&#xD;
      with the aid of a native speaker before study-related procedures were performed and the study&#xD;
      was conducted in line with the Declaration of Helsinki. Figure 1 describes the study design&#xD;
      in brief.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Sample size calculation was performed with G*Power 3. Basic data for sample size&#xD;
      calculation was the mean dental caries experience of preschool children in urban parts of The&#xD;
      Gambia that was reported to be 2.09 dmft teeth (SD: 1.92). An effect measure of caries&#xD;
      prevention by fluoridated table salt of 35 % was assumed according to the relevant&#xD;
      literature. Alpha error was set with 0.05, and the study power with 80 %. A target sample of&#xD;
      130 subjects for each study arm (test and control group) was calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants were children aged from 3 - 5 years living in urban Gambia with&#xD;
      preschool attendance at the co-operating kindergartens. The inclusion criteria for&#xD;
      participating in this study were:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. a complete primary dentition&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. parental or legal guardian informed consent. The only exclusion criteria was refusal to&#xD;
           participate in the study. Study End Points To measure the caries preventive effect of&#xD;
           salt fluoridation (1) the difference of incidence of cavitated carious lesions&#xD;
           (Δd3/4mft) after study related intervention was chosen as the primary end point. Using&#xD;
           the primary study end point, the relative preventive dental caries effect was calculated&#xD;
           according to the following formula: 100 - (Δd3/4mft (test group) / Δd3/4mft (control&#xD;
           group)) x 100.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary end points were:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (2) the difference of incidence of white spot lesions (ΔG2-4) with G2 denoting slight white&#xD;
      spot formation, G3 denoting excessive white spot formation, and G4 denoting white spot&#xD;
      formation with cavitation into enamel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (3) the difference of incidence of total carious lesions (ΔTCL (= G2-4 + d3/4mft)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total carious lesions (TCL) were calculated as a weighted sum score according to the&#xD;
      following weights: G2: 1 point; G3: 2 points; G4: 3 points; d3/4t and ft: 4 points; tooth&#xD;
      with pulpitis, ulcera, fistula or abscess due to caries: 5 points; missing tooth (mt): 6&#xD;
      points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For quality control, (4) a fluoride concentration measurement of the table salt was performed&#xD;
      as safety endpoint at t0, t0+6 mths, and t0+12 mths = t1. For this purpose, packages with&#xD;
      fluoridated salt and provided for the study were randomly selected. Measurements were&#xD;
      executed using an Orion Ionplus Fluoride Electrode (Thermo Electron, Beverly, USA) after&#xD;
      standardised calibration for low-level measurement. The analysis was undertaken in triplicate&#xD;
      per sample, and a mean was calculated for each measurement point. The threshold limit value&#xD;
      was set at 0.1 ppm F-.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants and Investigators Participants were screened, recruited, and included in the&#xD;
      study at two public preschools in Brikama, West Coast Region, The Gambia, in March 2012. The&#xD;
      screening and dental examinations took place during regular teaching time in an affiliated&#xD;
      dental station. Two investigation teams performed the study related examinations. A team&#xD;
      consisted of two dentists of which one was the clinical investigator and the other served as&#xD;
      information specialist. All were equally calibrated in clinical dental caries screening.&#xD;
      Inter-examiner Cohen´s reliability Ҡ was 0.82 [Cohen, 1960], indicating an almost perfect&#xD;
      match against the expert (RAJ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and Allocation Concealment As the intervention procedure was bound to the&#xD;
      communal preschool feeding, an individual randomization of subjects to the study arms was not&#xD;
      feasible. Instead, one preschool was chosen for intervention and the other preschool served&#xD;
      as control. The assortment of intervention was performed according to a random selection by a&#xD;
      person who apart from this was not involved in the study (LGW). All preschool children&#xD;
      meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria were primarily allocated to the test group and to&#xD;
      the control group, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions Natural fluoride availability in the Gambian West Coast Region had been&#xD;
      determined in advance of this interventional study to evaluate general fluoride availability.&#xD;
      In the study region, the fluoride concentration in drinking water was determined to be 0.1&#xD;
      mg/liter. In this region, traditional oral hygiene for children does not comprise (fluoride)&#xD;
      toothpastes until religious maturity at the age of about 12 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study related intervention of administration of fluoridated table salt (MarkenJodSalz +&#xD;
      Fluorid, Südsalz, Heilbronn, Germany) was organised during once-daily communal preschool&#xD;
      feeding. Acccording to the manufacturer's declaration, fluoride concentration of the&#xD;
      fluoridated table salt was 250 mg/kg. The central preschool kitchen was instructed to flavour&#xD;
      the meals with a calculated amount of fluoridated table salt. The amount was set with 0.4 mg&#xD;
      fluoride per capita and day for a period of 12 months. The study intervention period was&#xD;
      executed between September 2012 and August 2013. The calculation for the total flavouring&#xD;
      table salt amount was as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  number of subjects in the intervention preschool (including subjects not included in the&#xD;
           study but taking part in the communal preschool feeding) n = 450&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  fluoride concentration of fluoridated table salt: 25 mg F- per 100 g salt&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  recommended daily age-dependent supplementary dose: 0.4 mg fluoride per capita (i. e.&#xD;
           0.05 - 0.07 mg F- per kg body weight)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  consequently, 720 g fluoridated table salt daily for preparation of the communal&#xD;
           preschool feeding, resp. 1.6 g fluoridated table salt per capita and day, which complied&#xD;
           with recent WHO recommendations of salt intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meals of the control group were prepared without fluoridated table salt. Before starting the&#xD;
      intervention, all subjects received a dental examination at t0. Teeth were cleaned with an&#xD;
      electric toothbrush (Vitality precision clean, Oral-B, Schwalbach, Germany) before inspection&#xD;
      without using toothpaste. Teeth were then dried with cotton rolls (Cotton rolls for kids,&#xD;
      Roeko, Langenau, Germany) and hand-bellows (Delamax, Berlin, Germany). Dental caries&#xD;
      inspection was performed visually with the aid of dental mirrors and blunt probes in natural&#xD;
      light according to recent recommendation for epidemiological field studies. With respect to&#xD;
      available field hygiene measures, disposable dental instruments were used (Nordenta, Hamburg,&#xD;
      Germany). After completion of the intervention, all subjects were dentally examined again at&#xD;
      t1 in the exact same manner than at t0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Settings According to the allocation concealment, subjects of the test group were&#xD;
      preschool children at the &quot;Kindergarten Wattenscheid in Gambia&quot;, Brikama-Kabafita, West Coast&#xD;
      Region, The Gambia. Subjects of the control group were preschool children at the&#xD;
      &quot;Kindergarten Bottrop in Gambia&quot;, Brikama, West Coast Region, The Gambia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Hypothesis The investigators used a null hypothesis (H0) assuming no statistical&#xD;
      difference of Δd3/4mft at t1 between the test group and control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Demographic data were compared as inter group comparison using Wilcoxon&#xD;
      rank sum test with p &lt;0.05 for statistical significance. Analyses of the study end points&#xD;
      were performed using 95 percent confidence intervals (95%-CI). IBM SPSS software (version 21;&#xD;
      International Business Machines Corp, Armonk, USA) was used for computing statistical&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
