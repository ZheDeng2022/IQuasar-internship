  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pemetrexed is an anticancer agent that exerts its action by disrupting crucial&#xD;
      folate-dependent metabolic processes essential for cell replication. In vitro studies have&#xD;
      shown that pemetrexed behaves as a multitargeted antifolate by inhibiting thymidylate&#xD;
      synthase (TS), dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), and glycinamide ribonucleotide&#xD;
      formyltransferase (GARFT), which are key folate-dependent enzymes for the de novo&#xD;
      biosynthesis of thymidine and purine nucleotides.Pemetrexed is used as a standard therapeutic&#xD;
      agent for lung cancer, pleural mesothelioma, peritoneal mesothelioma.In addition to these&#xD;
      effective anti-cancer effect, Pemetrexed is not severe side effects of the medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pemetrexed has been research in colon cancer. Zhang, etc., demonstrated the anti-cancer&#xD;
      effect of Pemetrexed in human colon cancer Cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although sometimes made also two or more clinical studies, Pemetrexed was reported 15-17% of&#xD;
      the treatment response rate in these two studies.&#xD;
