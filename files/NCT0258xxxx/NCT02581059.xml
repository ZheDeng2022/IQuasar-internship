    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, multi-center phase II study of ginseng in colorectal cancer patients&#xD;
      treated with regorafenib to determine if ginseng will reduce fatigue in this patient&#xD;
      population and improve adherence to regorafenib. Ninety (90) subjects will be enrolled and&#xD;
      randomized using a 2:1 allocation, with 60 subjects enrolled in the regorafenib + ginseng&#xD;
      group and 30 enrolled in the regorafenib + no ginseng group.&#xD;

      OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INVESTIGATIONAL TREATMENT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regorafenib will be administered 160 mg orally once daily for the first 21 days of each&#xD;
      28-day cycle. Subjects that randomize to receive ginseng will take 1,000 mg orally twice&#xD;
      daily every day for 4 weeks (2 cycles). Subjects that randomize to NOT receive ginseng will&#xD;
      not be given ginseng. Subjects will be instructed to take regorafenib with a low-fat meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will undergo fatigue assessments, using the MFSI-SF instrument and PROMIS. Subjects&#xD;
      will have a pill count C2D1 and at the end of treatment visit. Subjects will have the&#xD;
      re-staging scan (CT of chest/abdomen/pelvis) at the end of Cycle 2/ week 8 (±5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adequate bone marrow, liver and renal function assessed by the following laboratory values&#xD;
      obtained within 7 days prior to registration for protocol therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hematopoietic:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) count &gt; 1,500/mm^3&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hemoglobin (Hgb) &gt; 9g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Platelet count &gt; 100,000/mm^3&#xD;
&#xD;
      Renal:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 × the upper limit of normal (ULN)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hepatic:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × the upper limit of normal (ULN).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate amino-transferase (AST) ≤ 2.5 x ULN (≤ 5 ×&#xD;
           ULN for subjects with liver involvement of their cancer)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) limit ≤ 2.5 × ULN (≤ 5 × ULN for subjects with liver&#xD;
           involvement of their cancer)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coagulation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  International normalized ratio (INR)/Partial thromboplastin time (PTT) ≤ 1.5 × ULN.&#xD;
           NOTE: Subjects who are prophylactically treated with an agent such as warfarin or&#xD;
           heparin will be allowed to participate if no prior evidence of underlying abnormality in&#xD;
           coagulation parameters exists. Close monitoring of at least weekly evaluations will be&#xD;
           performed until INR/PTT is stable, based on a measurement that is pre-dose as defined by&#xD;
           the local standard of care. Warfarin does should not exceed 1 mg.&#xD;
