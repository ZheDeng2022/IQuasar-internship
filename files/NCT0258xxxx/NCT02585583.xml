    <textblock>
      The gamma knife radiosurgical thalamotomy to treat many movement disorders is recently&#xD;
      becoming a new and well defined treatment paradigm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CyberKnife if compared to the frame-based radiosurgery, is a pain free procedure which&#xD;
      offers the advantage of a better patient's compliance by avoiding local anaesthesia and the&#xD;
      discomfort due to wearing the frame for the period of time needed for the whole procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately the subtle but substantial differences about the 3D dose distribution and the&#xD;
      dose fall-off features between GK and CK made mandatory investigations about the&#xD;
      effectiveness and the safety when the cyberknife is used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Particularly the minimum effective and safety dose have to be defined yet A previous study&#xD;
      (NCT02095600) failed in demonstrating the efficacy of 75 Gy, 80 Gy, 90 Gy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is to investigate about the effectiveness of 100 Gy, 120 Gy, 130&#xD;
      Gy and 140 Gy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety and the targeting methodology will be also in investigated.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND The stereotactic lesioning of thalamus and basal ganglia for the treatment of&#xD;
      tremor is a well-known procedure which, before the introduction of deep brain stimulation (&#xD;
      DBS), was usually performed using stereotactic surgical procedures.[16] Consistent positive&#xD;
      experience in functional radiosurgery using the Gamma Knife or linear accelerators was&#xD;
      reported since the first report by Leksell in 1951.[4, 8, 11, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 21, 24, 25,&#xD;
      26, 27] CyberKnife (CK), (Accuray Inc., Sunnyvale, California, USA) allows a real frameless&#xD;
      stereotactic radiosurgery of recognizable intracranial targets such as arteriovenous&#xD;
      malformations (AVMs), tumours, and trigeminal nerve for the treatment of trigeminal&#xD;
      neuralgia.[1, 2, 3, 7, 9, 23] When compared to the frame-based radiosurgery , frameless&#xD;
      radiosurgery is a pain free procedure which offers the advantage of a better patient's&#xD;
      compliance by avoiding local anaesthesia and the discomfort due to wearing the frame for the&#xD;
      period of time needed for the whole procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present literature on functional frame-based radiosurgery (mainly based on Gamma Knife&#xD;
      treatments) shows that, while a mean dose of 140 Gy has been effectively used, toxicity&#xD;
      increases with higher doses. Moreover the minimal effective dose has never been reported [8,&#xD;
      10, 15, 25 ].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the fact that the 3D dose distribution with Gamma Knife shows some subtle but&#xD;
      substantial differences with the Cyberknife, the investigators chose a lower prescription&#xD;
      dose compared to the literature data when performing our first attempts to treat movement&#xD;
      disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Particularly the prescription dose as the minimum effective dose for a functional disorder&#xD;
      such as trigeminal neuralgia was identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At that time no previous CyberKnife experiences had been reported. The first two patients&#xD;
      treated at our Institution by using these lower treatment doses (75 and 90 Gy respectively)&#xD;
      [28] had remarkably positive results thus bringing us to consider the real relative&#xD;
      effectiveness of low doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The minimum effective dose to perform a thalamotomy was chosen accordingly , by drawing a&#xD;
      dose escalation clinical trial rather than a de-escalation dose protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Particularly, the protocol started with a dose of 75 Gy and reached a dose of 90 Gy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis of the results from this trial highlighted the absence of tremor control but&#xD;
      also confirmed the absolute safety of the selected doses (no reported toxicity).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this the aim of the present study is to continue the experience to define the minimum&#xD;
      effective dose when performing a safe frameless radiosurgical thalamotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover radiosurgery of invisible targets to treat movement disorders and intractable pain&#xD;
      are so far still the domain of frame-based procedures, due to the need of a solid reference&#xD;
      system registered to the anterior commissure-posterior commissure (AC-PC) line, which allows&#xD;
      the use of stereotactic atlases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the investigators want to confirm the precision of the previously defined&#xD;
      mathematical method (that uses atlas-derived stereotactic coordinates) to perform safe&#xD;
      frameless radiosurgery of invisible targets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN Longitudinal, interventional study. The project is a dose escalation study&#xD;
      (phase II study). The effect of the treatment in term of tremor control will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Particularly, the differences between pre and post-treatment tremor item score will be&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The radiological (MRI/CT) appearance of a radiation necrosis at the treatment site as well as&#xD;
      the toxicities will be also considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will finish when the 4 dose levels will be delivered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRE-TREATMENT EVALUATION Prior medical history and physical examination. Complete history,&#xD;
      physical examination including a detailed neurological examination and evaluation of&#xD;
      Karnofsky Performance Status will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Fahn Tolosa Marin tremor rating scale (FTMTRS) will be assessed for all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The unified Parkinson disease rating scale motor score will be utilize to define the severity&#xD;
      of symptoms only in case of Parkinson's disease Unresponsiveness to conservative treatment&#xD;
      will be verified. Any prior surgery, prior radiation therapy and/or radiosurgery of the brain&#xD;
      will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior surgery at the site of the lesion, prior radiation therapy and/or radiosurgery of the&#xD;
      brain will not prevent the patient from participating in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk analysis of surgery procedure will be express by a skilled neurological surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRE-TREATMENT IMAGING PROCEDURE A 1 mm thickness high quality CT Scan and a dedicated MRI&#xD;
      will be always acquired.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When possible a 3tesla MRI will be utilized. The multimodality images will be fused and then&#xD;
      exported to the CK treatment planning system (TPS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      CYBERKNIFE RADIOSURGERY The target selection. The preferentially selected target of treatment&#xD;
      will be the VoO-VoP nuclei of the Thalamous The choice of VoA (12-13 mm lateral to the&#xD;
      midline, 2 mm anterior to the midcommissural point and 2 mm superior to the commissural plane&#xD;
      ) was intended to lessen the risk of anatomical variability in these patients. In fact, this&#xD;
      target is relatively far from the motor fibres running in the posterior limb of the internal&#xD;
      capsule and far from other &quot;eloquent&quot; nuclei.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The VIM nuclei can be considered because the similarity of the main features. Target&#xD;
      definition and stereotactic atlas registration of the CT images. During CT scanning it is&#xD;
      critical that the patient's head remains in a fixed position in order to avoid movement&#xD;
      artefacts. For the patients high-quality images will be obtained by restraining the patient's&#xD;
      head using a standard thermoplastic mask and acquiring the images very rapidly, always less&#xD;
      than 40 seconds with the CT equipment in our possession (Light Speed Ultra, General Electric,&#xD;
      Fairfield, Connecticut, USA). Mild sedation may be necessary in some cases with head tremor.&#xD;
      In more severe cases, in which body and/or head movements could prevent an optimal image&#xD;
      acquisition, administration of low-dosage of Midazolam under anaesthesiological control is&#xD;
      mandatory. If the head is immobile the CT gantry behaves like a solid reference system with&#xD;
      fixed relationships to the brain structures. In other words the CT screen may be seen as a&#xD;
      bi-dimensional stereotactic frame and each pixel of the CT screen represents a discrete part&#xD;
      of the brain identified by X lateral and Y antero-posterior coordinates to the screen origin.&#xD;
      The slice containing the anterior commissure (AC) is arbitrarily assigned to depth = 0 (Z&#xD;
      coordinate); the depth of each slice is calculated relative to this point (the slices are&#xD;
      1.25 mm thickness). The system calculate the AC X, Y, and Z coordinates (Z = 0) and the&#xD;
      coordinates of the posterior commissure (PC) where Z is the distance in mm from slice zero.&#xD;
      In cases in which the AC and PC lie on the same slice, AC and PC Z coordinates are both equal&#xD;
      zero and the calculations are easier. Finally the values in pixels are converted into&#xD;
      millimetres based on the matrix/FOV ratio of the CT screen. In other words X and Y value of&#xD;
      each pixel of the brain image on the CT screen are obtained and Z is derived as the depth of&#xD;
      the slice measured as the vertical distance from the slice 0. Finally the investigators&#xD;
      calculate the coordinates of the AC-PC midpoint, which is the origin of the stereotactic&#xD;
      atlas, and a simple rototranslation between the origin of the screen and the origin of the&#xD;
      stereotactic atlas allows us to obtain atlas-registered X, Y, and Z coordinates in&#xD;
      millimeters of each point on the CT axial brain slices (Fig. 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target coordinates of Voa/Vop complex ( X = +/-12 mm , Y = 2 mm , Z = 2 mm) derived from the&#xD;
      stereotactic atlases registered to the mid-commissural point are easily transposed onto the&#xD;
      corresponding CT slice and the target is drawn on the treatment planning system (Multiplan,&#xD;
      Accuray Inc.). In other words, the axes roto-translation between the CT screen and the&#xD;
      commissural system of the patient allows the use of atlas-derived stereotactic coordinates to&#xD;
      make the invisible functional target visible. The CT images will be also be fused with MRI to&#xD;
      obtain more anatomic details about the anatomical structures surrounding the estimated&#xD;
      target.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High quality control of CT couch movements is of course mandatory for the above described&#xD;
      procedure and possible undesired movements of the CT couch during the examination could&#xD;
      affect the precision of the Z coordinate; even if the Voa/Vop complex is relatively close&#xD;
      (slice + 2mm) to the slice containing the anterior commissure (slice 0) , possible errors&#xD;
      must be taken into account.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A MRI (1 mm slice, T1 sequence ) will be performed and merged with TC images . Radiosurgical&#xD;
      planning. After than the target volume will be identified and the critical normal structures&#xD;
      will be contoured, in conjunction with a physicist, inverse planning using the CyberKnife&#xD;
      Treatment planning system (TPS) will be performed to yield a treatment plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment plan used for each treatment will be based on an analysis of the volumes and&#xD;
      doses including dose-volume histogram (DVH) analyses of the PTV and critical normal&#xD;
      structures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Doses selection The aim of this procedure is to cause a lesion confined to the estimated&#xD;
      target. The first 2 patient will be treated with a dose of 100 Gy to the 100% isodose line,&#xD;
      the 3rd and the 4th patient will be escalated with 120 Gy to the 100% isodose line, the 5th&#xD;
      and 6th patient will be treated with 130 Gy to the 100% isodose line and then the dose will&#xD;
      be escalated to140 Gy will be utilized (7th and 8th).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will be delivered as a single shot radiosurgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PATIENT ASSESSMENTS Evaluation During Treatment Patients will be seen and evaluated during&#xD;
      CyberKnife radiosurgery with documentation of tolerance, including acute reaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation Following Treatment Patients will be followed as follows 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24&#xD;
      months after radiosurgery Images (CT and/or MRI) will be performed and the modification of&#xD;
      target size will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FTMTRS and/or UPDRS score will be assessed. At each follow-up visits, toxicity will be&#xD;
      evaluated and documented Criteria for tremor response The tremor control assessment will be&#xD;
      based on the quantitative/qualitative analysis of pre and post-treatment tremor rating scale&#xD;
      score/graphical features.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The quantitative analysis will be based on the numerical differences between pre and&#xD;
      post-treatment FTMTRS score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The qualitative analysis was mainly based on the visual judgement of the Jancovich spiral&#xD;
      drawing from the FTMTRS..&#xD;
&#xD;
      UPDRS motor will be also evaluated for patients affected by Parkinson Disease (PD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      DISEASE RELATED DRUG ADMINISTRATION DURING THE TREATMENT AND FOLLOW-UP PERIOD Levodopa&#xD;
      equivalent daily dosage (LEDD) will be tentatively maintained during all the observation&#xD;
      period. LEDD could be modified for a relevant worsening of symptoms (akinesia and/or rigidity&#xD;
      not for tremor).&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL CONSIDERATION Descriptive statistic (mean, percentage, frequency, etc.) will be&#xD;
      performed on quantitative variables&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADVERSE EVENTS AND RADIOSURGERY TOXICITY Adverse events will be graded and registered&#xD;
      according to National Cancer Institute, Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events&#xD;
      (NCI-CTCAE) version 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serious Adverse Event stopping criteria. The study will be closed if more than 2 patients&#xD;
      will show a serious adverse events related to or suspected for a relation with the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA COLLECTION Patients will be allocated a number and their data will be collected on a&#xD;
      Case Report Forms. Data will include information from each protocol visit and will be&#xD;
      completed on a timely manner.&#xD;
