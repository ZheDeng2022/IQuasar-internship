  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Arterial hypertension has been recognized as a major causal factor for atrial fibrillation&#xD;
      (AF), the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia. In light of its worldwide increasing&#xD;
      prevalence and incidence and the accompanied increase in the risk of stroke, thromboembolic&#xD;
      events and mortality, AF has emerged as a global healthcare problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early diagnosis of AF, prior to the occurrence of complications is a recognized priority for&#xD;
      the prevention of strokes. Once diagnosed, anticoagulant therapy is the cornerstone in the&#xD;
      management of the risk of stroke in AF patients. The 2012 ESC Guidelines recommend the use of&#xD;
      a risk factor-based approach to stroke risk stratification for AF patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims towards gaining real-world data on the prevalence of non-valvular atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation (NVAF) among hypertensives in Greece. The rate of ESC guideline-adherent&#xD;
      antithrombotic therapy on the basis of stroke and bleeding risk assessments, and factors&#xD;
      influencing treatment decision-making will be assessed as well in patients diagnosed with the&#xD;
      arrhythmia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, potential differences in the NVAF prevalence in adequately and inadequately&#xD;
      controlled hypertensives will be documented.&#xD;
