  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well paclitaxel and pembrolizumab works in treating patients&#xD;
      with urothelial cancer that has not responded to previous treatment and has spread to other&#xD;
      places in the body. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, work in different ways to&#xD;
      stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing,&#xD;
      or by stopping them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may&#xD;
      interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving paclitaxel together with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab may be an effective treatment for urothelial cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the overall response rate (ORR) of pembrolizumab combined with paclitaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of pembrolizumab combined with paclitaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To calculate the progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the immune effects of pembrolizumab combined with paclitaxel. II. To&#xD;
      associate immune effects with tumor response. III. To explore changes in immune-regulatory&#xD;
      micro ribonucleic acids (RNAs) as biomarkers of response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 and paclitaxel IV&#xD;
      over 60 minutes on day 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 8 courses in the absence&#xD;
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up within 30 days and then every 3&#xD;
      months for 1 year.&#xD;
