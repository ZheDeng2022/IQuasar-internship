  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a chronic disease of the lungs characterized by airway inflammation,&#xD;
      bronchoconstriction and increased airway responsiveness. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), alone&#xD;
      or in combination with inhaled long-acting beta-adrenergic agonists (LABA), are considered a&#xD;
      mainstay of treatment for treatment. For inhaled medications, the choice of inhalation device&#xD;
      is an important consideration because an inadequate technique reduces the delivery of&#xD;
      medicines and effects of inhalation. Therefore, the development of an easy-to-use inhaler&#xD;
      that delivers the drug to the lungs effectively, is important. This study is designed to&#xD;
      assess the correct use of the ELLIPTA inhaler in subjects with asthma and also to assess ease&#xD;
      of use of the ELLIPTA inhaler, as rated by those subjects determined to be using the inhaler&#xD;
      correctly. Study will be divided into two visits i.e. Screening/Visit 1 (day 1) and Visit 2&#xD;
      (Day 28 +/-2) with a phone call on Day 8+/-2 days of Visit 1 to assess safety. In this&#xD;
      multi-center, single-arm, randomised (to receive one of two versions of the ELLIPTA inhaler&#xD;
      Ease of Use questionnaires), open-label, placebo study, only subjects who are have never used&#xD;
      the ELLIPTA inhaler before and have an established diagnosis of asthma and receiving asthma&#xD;
      therapy and are able to demonstrate correct use of the ELLIPTA inhaler at Visit 1 will be&#xD;
      considered eligible to participate in this study. Approximately 252 subjects will be screened&#xD;
      with an expectation of 208 subjects completing the study while demonstrating correct ELLIPTA&#xD;
      inhaler use at visit 2.&#xD;
