      This clinical study is to observe the improvement of MHD (maintenance hemodialysis) patients,&#xD;
      quality of lifeï¼Œafter applying therapy combining Auriculotherapy and Shengmai capsule. As a&#xD;
      compliment to each other, Traditional Chinese Medicine and Modern Medicine form a joint and&#xD;
      help improving life quality of MHD patients. Through the therapy, MHD patients, symptoms of&#xD;
      thirst are improved, the incidence of intradialytic hypotension is reduced, the intake of&#xD;
      water and sodium is lessen and the weight gain during dialysis is controlled, which&#xD;
      consequently reduce cardiovascular and cerebrovascular complications and eventually reduce&#xD;
      the mortality of MHD patients. Aiming to improve patients, thirst symptom and reduce the&#xD;
      incidence of intradialytic hypotension, this study prospectively followed 144 MHD patients&#xD;
      using multicenter prospective randomized crossover controlled clinical studies, using KT/V,&#xD;
      URR, improvement of thirst, blood pressure and cognitive assessment as observational index.&#xD;
      Multiple questionnaire surveys are conducted to understand patients, life quality from&#xD;
      different angle. The use of Auriculotherapy is simple and effective and Shengmai capsule&#xD;
      conforms to patients, syndrome, which is consistent with TCMs principle of &quot;syndrome&#xD;
      differentiation and treatment&quot;and the theory of preventive treatment. The study not only&#xD;
      expends the use of TMC in hemodialysis treatment, but also suggests a set of easy therapeutic&#xD;
      schedules to improve the quality of life in patients receiving hemodialysis treatment.&#xD;

      3.1 research object 3.1.1 case: 3.1.1.1 Beijing University of Chinese Medicine Dongzhimen&#xD;
      hospital 48 cases 3.1.1.2 54 cases of Oriental Hospital of Beijing University of Chinese&#xD;
      Medicine 3.1.1.3 Chinese Academy of traditional Chinese medicine, Wangjing Hospital, 20 cases&#xD;
      3.1.1.4 28 case of Beijing Pinggu Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine 3.1.2 diagnostic&#xD;
      criteria: 3.1.2.1: syndrome score standard: according to the traditional Chinese medicine&#xD;
      clinical research guiding principle (2002), chronic renal failure syndrome of deficiency of&#xD;
      both qi and Yin compiled score table and determine the inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnostic criteria of hypotension in 3.1.2.2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Referring to the Ministry of health of the people's Republic of China promulgated the &quot;blood&#xD;
      purification standard operating procedures (2010 Edition)&quot; in the &quot;blood dialysis hypotension&#xD;
      prevention and control standards for the prevention and control of standard operating&#xD;
      procedures&quot;, the diagnostic criteria are as follows: (1) can be diagnosed: (1) systolic blood&#xD;
      pressure reduction of more than 20mmHg; (2) the average arterial pressure decreased more than&#xD;
      10mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1.2.3 mouth thirst intensity score The investigators will mouth thirst intensity score&#xD;
      table (XQ) eight problems in the translation into Chinese questionnaire, each question by&#xD;
      visual rating scale method and by the patients according to their own scoring. The higher&#xD;
      score indicated the mouth thirst more serious or mouth thirst caused discomfort heavier, and&#xD;
      the summation of the scores of each question and convert it to a range of 0 to 100 score,&#xD;
      resulting score higher mouth thirst more serious degree.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1.4.2 on the treatment of Chinese and Western medicine treatment of poor compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1.4.3 infection, fever, acute heart failure or diabetes and blood glucose control is not&#xD;
      ideal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1.4.4 for the preparation of the capsule and the skin allergic patients with adhesive tape.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1.4.5 patients can not cooperate or not sign the informed consent. 3.1.5 removing and&#xD;
      dropping standard 3.1.5.1 all cases that are not included in the criteria for inclusion in&#xD;
      the inclusion criteria shall be excluded; 3.1.5.2 clinical information is not the whole case&#xD;
      to be removed. 3.2 case grouping method This research is to set up experimental group&#xD;
      (Western medicine routine + acupoint therapy combined with birth control group) and the&#xD;
      control group (Western medicine group). To meet the inclusion exclusion criteria of the&#xD;
      subjects, using random number table method to produce random sequence number, according to&#xD;
      the random sequence number to the subjects were assigned to different treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.3 treatment method and treatment The clinical design of this study was a randomized&#xD;
      crossover trial. This experiment research is divided into two stages, each stage is 8 weeks.&#xD;
      Experimental group on regular hemodialysis based on given auricular therapy selected export&#xD;
      sympathetic endocrine, God door, massage time for about 1 minute, 3 ~ 5 times / day, each&#xD;
      taking one side ear, 3 ~ 7 days take on the other side of the ear; Shengmai capsules and&#xD;
      Shengmai Capsules (ChiaTai Qingchunbao Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Chinese medicine quasi word&#xD;
      Z33021036, every grain of 0.3g. Ingredients: ginseng, ophiopogon root, Schisandra 3 capsules&#xD;
      / time, 3 times / day. Control group received regular hemodialysis treatment, completed in&#xD;
      the treatment of the first stage. After 4 weeks after a washout period, two groups of cross&#xD;
      accept the next phase of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.5 observation index 3.5.1 safety index: Into the group, crossover trial and the end of the&#xD;
      experiment were used to detect the blood routine hemodialysis patients, before and after&#xD;
      dialysis and renal ion, and serum albumin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.5.2 evaluation index:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. and KT/V: and URR were measured in the clinical observation of the biochemical,&#xD;
           dialysis, and body weight at the end of the biochemical, dialysis, and weight gain of&#xD;
           hemodialysis and Improvement Center. URR = (BUN) /BUN (BUN = 100%) + (4 *) + (3.5 * R) *&#xD;
           KT/V (R = R) (BUN = 0.03) (LN = UF/W) (BUN =).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. thirst improvement: combined with clinical experience, thirst was divided into eight&#xD;
           levels (combined with patients' self perception and thirst intensity score), making a&#xD;
           thirst scale, in the group, when the end of the experiment and the end of the&#xD;
           experiment, respectively, to observe the improvement of thirst before and after&#xD;
           treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. on the basis of the analysis of the improvement of the low blood pressure (first):&#xD;
           according to the diagnostic criteria of hypotension in hemodialysis patients, the&#xD;
           incidence of hypotension in the experimental group and the second stage was compared&#xD;
           with that of the experimental group and the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. the quality of life improvement in dialysis patients: in the clinical observation, the&#xD;
           patients were treated with in-depth interviews, the use of key data extraction methods,&#xD;
           to reflect the quality of life of patients with dialysis information; in the clinical&#xD;
           observation of the patients, the cross exchange and the end of the life quality of SF-36&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
