      This is a phase II, prospective open label multi-center study in which subjects with stage&#xD;
      II-III rectal cancer will be accrued in order to determine the pathological complete response&#xD;
      rate of neoadjuvant pembrolizumab in combination with chemoradiation treatment (CRT).&#xD;
      Subjects must have a diagnosis of rectal cancer, stage II (T3-4, N0) or stage III (any T,&#xD;
      N1-2). Subjects must have received no prior treatments (chemotherapy, pelvic radiation or&#xD;
      surgery) for their rectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will receive standard chemoradiation with pembrolizumab administered every&#xD;
      3 weeks on days 1, 22, and 43 of the neoadjuvant interval. In all subjects, restaging&#xD;
      endorectal or pelvic MRI with chest and abdominal CT will be performed at 6-8 weeks after&#xD;
      completion of neoadjuvant treatment to determine resectability and to rule out any evidence&#xD;
      of metastases. Subjects who have resectable disease will undergo surgery within 2-4 weeks of&#xD;
      imaging; 8-12 weeks after completion of chemoradiation. Subjects who are found to have&#xD;
      unresectable or metastatic disease post treatment with the combination of CRT+ pembrolizumab&#xD;
      should receive standard of care definitive treatment per the discretion of their treating&#xD;
      physician.&#xD;

      OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NEOADJUVANT TREATMENT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will receive concurrent chemoradiation and pembrolizumab neoadjuvant treatment&#xD;
      for 6 weeks:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pembrolizumab 200 mg Intravenously (IV) Days 1, 22 and 43&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Capecitabine 825 mg/m2 PO (by mouth) in twice daily doses (daily total 1650 mg/m2) on 5&#xD;
           consecutive days / week Monday-Friday given on the radiation days for 28 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Radiation 50.4 Gy (Gray) in daily fractions of 1.8 Gy over a 6 week interval,excludes&#xD;
           weekends&#xD;
&#xD;
      POST NEOADJUVANT TREATMENT:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  End of treatment (EOT) 6-8 weeks after last dose of neoadjuvant treatment, all subjects&#xD;
           will be assessed to determine resectability. Those with resectable disease will undergo&#xD;
           surgery within 2-4 weeks of imaging, 8-12 weeks after completion of chemoradiation.&#xD;
           Subjects who are found to have unresectable or metastatic disease post treatment with&#xD;
           the combination of CRT+ pembrolizumab should receive standard of care definitive&#xD;
           treatment per the discretion of their treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surgical Resection ( 2-4 weeks after restaging imaging and 8-12 weeks after completion&#xD;
           of chemoradiation)&#xD;

           months)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Survival Follow Up - Years 3-5&#xD;

           is receiving anticoagulant therapy (as long as PT or PTT is within therapeutic range of&#xD;
           intended use of anticoagulants)&#xD;
&#xD;

             participate, in the opinion of the site investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation&#xD;
             with the requirements of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serious uncontrolled medical disorder that in the opinion of the site investigator&#xD;
             would impair the ability of the subject to receive protocol therapy.&#xD;
