      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of berzosertib (M6620 [VX-970])&#xD;
      when given together with whole brain radiation therapy in treating patients with non-small&#xD;
      cell lung cancer, small cell lung cancer, or neuroendocrine tumors that have spread from the&#xD;
      original (primary) tumor to the brain (brain metastases). Berzosertib may stop the growth of&#xD;
      tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Radiation therapy uses&#xD;
      high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving berzosertib together with&#xD;
      radiation therapy may work better compared to standard of care treatment, including brain&#xD;
      surgery and radiation therapy, in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer, small&#xD;
      cell lung cancer, or neuroendocrine tumors.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To conduct a phase 1 dose escalation trial in patients with brain metastases from&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of twice&#xD;
      weekly intravenous (i.v.) M6620 (VX-970, berzosertib) administered concurrent with&#xD;
      conventionally fractionated whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT), with M6620 (VX-970, berzosertib)&#xD;
      starting 18-30 hours after the first dose of radiation (but prior to the second fraction of&#xD;
      radiation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the incidence of &gt;= grade 3 delayed neurological toxicity at 2, 4 and 6-months&#xD;
      post-completion of whole-brain radiotherapy (for patients without intracranial progression).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. IIa. To estimate the radiological response&#xD;
      rates (RR) at 6 months including bi-directional and volumetric measurements of lesion size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IIb. To estimate the intracranial 6-month progression-free survival (PFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY/HYPOTHESIS GENERATING OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Changes in dynamic susceptibility contrast enhancement (DSC-magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      [MRI]) perfusion and mean apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) measurements in&#xD;
      diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI). (Group I) II. To measure cerebrospinal&#xD;
      fluid (CSF) M6620 (VX-970, berzosertib) levels, tumor M6620 (VX-970, berzosertib) levels, and&#xD;
      pATR T1989, pCHK1 S345 and RAD51 multiplex foci. (Group II) III. Changes in DSC-MRI perfusion&#xD;
      and mean ADC measurements in DWI. (Group II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of berzosertib. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2&#xD;
      treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP I: Patients undergo whole-brain radiation therapy once daily (QD), 5 days a week for 15&#xD;
      fractions. Patients also receive berzosertib intravenously (IV) over 60-90 minutes twice a&#xD;
      week, 18-30 hours after first radiation therapy. Treatment continues for 3 weeks in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP II: Patients receive berzosertib IV over 60-90 minutes 2-4 hours prior to surgery.&#xD;
      After surgery, patients undergo whole-brain radiation therapy and receive berzosertib as in&#xD;
      Group I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2 months for 6 months,&#xD;
      every 3-4 months for 6 months, then every 6 months for 1 year.&#xD;

             stereotactic radiosurgery [SRS]) for radiologically or histologically diagnosed brain&#xD;
             metastases presumed to be from the lung cancer are eligible for this Phase I study.&#xD;
             Group 2 will only include NSCLC patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectance of greater than two months to allow completion of study treatment and&#xD;

             craniotomy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt;= 18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on&#xD;
             the use of M6620 (VX-970, berzosertib) in patients &lt; 18 years of age, children are&#xD;
             excluded from this study, but will be eligible for future pediatric trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =&lt; 2 (Karnofsky &gt;= 60%)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note: though patients with ECOG performance status of 3 due to neurological&#xD;
                  deficits who are otherwise fit to receive systemic therapy per clinician&#xD;
                  assessments will be allowed&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Negative serum or urine pregnancy test result for females of child bearing potential&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The effects of M6620 (VX-970, berzosertib) on the developing human fetus are&#xD;
                  unknown. For this reason and because radiation therapy is known to have&#xD;
                  teratogenic potential, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use&#xD;
                  adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence)&#xD;
                  prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman&#xD;
                  become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is&#xD;
                  participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician&#xD;
                  immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use&#xD;
                  adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study&#xD;
                  participation, and 6 months after completion of M6620 (VX-970, berzosertib)&#xD;
                  administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with 1-3 brain metastases, each &lt; 3 cm by contrast MRI, with stable systemic&#xD;
             disease and ECOG score of 0-2, who would otherwise be eligible for SRS/stereotactic&#xD;
             radiation therapy (SRT) alone should not be enrolled into this study unless WBRT is&#xD;
             recommended due to any medical reasons or logistic limitations as determined by the&#xD;
             treating physician. Patients who develop recurrence post-SRS/SRT or surgery alone and&#xD;
             are recommended WBRT will be eligible for the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Greater than 1 cm mid-line shift, severe uncal herniation or significant&#xD;
             hemorrhage/hydrocephalus (intra-lesional hemorrhage is acceptable). Patients with&#xD;
             seizure at presentation who have been started on levetiracetam and have been stable&#xD;
             for 48 hours prior to study registration are eligible at the discretion of treating&#xD;
             physician&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have received systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy and/or, immunotherapy or&#xD;
             other intravenous standard therapy for 2 weeks before initiation of planned WBRT, for&#xD;
             oral targeted agents 3-7 days per clinician discretion or patients who have not&#xD;
             recovered to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade 2 or less&#xD;
             from serious (CTCAE grade 3 or more) adverse events form the previously received&#xD;
             agents. For any other investigational agents, at least 4 half-lives of the agent (6&#xD;
             weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) should have elapsed prior to starting study&#xD;
             treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have received prior WBRT (previous SRS/SRT done at least 2 weeks&#xD;
             from the planned start of WBRT is acceptable). Patients planned upfront to undergo&#xD;
             SRS/SRT/fractionated boosts or neurosurgery after WBRT are not eligible; however,&#xD;
             these treatments/procedures can be performed once the dose limiting toxicity (DLT)&#xD;
             assessment has been completed, if felt clinically necessary&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because M6620 (VX-970, berzosertib) as a&#xD;
             deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-damage response (DDR) inhibitor may have the potential for&#xD;
             teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Further, radiation therapy is known to have the&#xD;
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but&#xD;
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with M6620 (VX-970, berzosertib), breastfeeding should be discontinued if the&#xD;
             mother is treated with M6620 (VX-970, berzosertib).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to M6620 (VX-970, berzosertib).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  M6620 (VX-970, berzosertib) is primarily metabolized by cytochrome P450, family 3,&#xD;
             subfamily A, polypeptide 4 (CYP3A4); therefore, concomitant administration with strong&#xD;
             inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 should be avoided. Because the lists of these agents&#xD;
             are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated&#xD;
             medical reference for a list of drugs to avoid or minimize use of. As part of the&#xD;
             enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of&#xD;
             interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be&#xD;
             prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal&#xD;
             product. Ongoing phenytoin should be either discontinued if clinically safe or&#xD;
             transitioned to non-enzyme-inducing antiepileptics like levetiracetam with a 8-day&#xD;
             washout period (half-life 18-22 hours, time to steady-state 4-8 days) prior to first&#xD;
             dose of M6620 (VX-970, berzosertib) (7-days prior to WBRT).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients needing more than 8 mg dexamethasone per day at the time of start of WBRT&#xD;
             will not be eligible to participate in the study. However, patients will be allowed&#xD;
             entry into the study if it is medically safe to reduce the daily dose of dexamethasone&#xD;
             to 8 mg or less from the day of the start of WBRT. The dexamethasone dose for such&#xD;
             patients may be increased beyond 8 mg per day during the course of treatment if&#xD;
             medically necessary. This increased need for dose should be communicated to the&#xD;
             study's principal investigator, Dr Mohindra at the University of Maryland.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness that would increase the risk of toxicity or limit&#xD;
             compliance with study requirements. This includes but is not limited to, ongoing&#xD;
             uncontrolled serious infection requiring i.v. antibiotics at the time of registration,&#xD;
             or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study&#xD;
             requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients on combination antiretroviral&#xD;
             therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with&#xD;
             M6620 (VX-970, berzosertib) and the uncertainties of any impact thereof on the&#xD;
             radiation toxicities. In addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal&#xD;
             infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be&#xD;
             undertaken in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known diagnoses that are associated with germline DDR defects such as Li&#xD;
