  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the second most common cancer in the UK with around 43,500 new patients&#xD;
      diagnosed each year. About 69% of patients are diagnosed with advanced stage disease and at&#xD;
      present these patients would be expected to survive for less than 12 months. These statistics&#xD;
      therefore show the need for the development of new effective drugs in the treatment of&#xD;
      advanced Lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent trial results have shown the efficacy of immunotherapy in treating several types of&#xD;
      tumours including lung cancer. These tumours are known to express a high level of a&#xD;
      glycoprotein called PDL1 which is a component of the PD1 pathway. In cancer the PD1 pathway&#xD;
      can be hijacked by tumours leading to the immune system being suppressed. The aim of the new&#xD;
      drug Pembrolizumab is to restart the PD1 pathway and use the immune system to help fight the&#xD;
      cancer cells. Radiotherapy has also been shown to cause cancer to increase production of the&#xD;
      proteins that can block the immune system. Therefore it has been proposed that combine of new&#xD;
      immunotherapy agent such as pembrolizumab and radiotherapy in the treatment of lung cancer&#xD;
      will allow more cancer cells to be killed through the immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to see if pembrolizumab can safety be combined with standard&#xD;
      palliative radiotherapy in patients with lung cancer. In addition once the patients have&#xD;
      completed their course of radiotherapy they will remain on pembrolizumab alone and the study&#xD;
      will look at how well this treatment regimen can control the growth of the cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      1. Risk and burden for patients&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients in the first part of this study have cancer that is no longer responding to&#xD;
           standard anticancer drug treatments.The phase 1 nature of this study means that the&#xD;
           trial intervention may not have any additional benefit for patients who take part in the&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The study itself carries a number of potential burdens:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Study drug and radiotherapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Although the study drug safety effects have previously been assessed in NSCLC the side&#xD;
           effects caused by the addition of radiotherapy is unconfirmed. These risks will be&#xD;
           managed as much as possible by cautious dose escalation: as with all phase 1 studies,&#xD;
           the data from each cohort will be reviewed by a safety review committee before deciding&#xD;
           whether to increase the dose for subsequent cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participants will be reviewed regularly by experienced clinicians while having the study&#xD;
           treatment. Comprehensive assessments for safety will be carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Burden of frequent hospital visits and tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participants in this study must attend hospital frequently, particularly at the start of&#xD;
           the study, for safety reasons to check for any toxicity of the study treatment. Blood&#xD;
           tests, clinical examination, urine tests, haematology, bio chemistry and lung function&#xD;
           tests are part of the safety assessment. Additionally, for research purposes some&#xD;
           participants may be asked to have additional blood taken, these will not be mandatory&#xD;
           for entry into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be offered information about this study by their clinical teams if they are&#xD;
      considered to meet the entry criteria (with regard to advanced disease without therapeutic&#xD;
      option, suitable performance status) and express interest in taking part in an experimental&#xD;
      study. It will be made clear that the study is experimental in nature and that there will not&#xD;
      necessarily be a therapeutic benefit from taking part in the study. It will also be made&#xD;
      clear that, should patients decide not to take part their future care will not be affected.&#xD;
      Patients will be given sufficient time and information to make an informed decision about&#xD;
      entering the trial, all patients entering the trial will give written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Confidentiality&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be linked to a unique identifier the code for which will be held on a password&#xD;
      protected database held only by the study team. This study will run at the Royal Marsden&#xD;
      Hospital Only. Research blood and tumour data will be analysed by a team at the Institute of&#xD;
      cancer Research. Sample processing will take place using the trial ID only. No other patient&#xD;
      identifiable information will be available on study samples. Investigators will have access&#xD;
      to patient identifiable information on password protected NHS hospital notes and databases&#xD;
      only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. Conflict of Interest&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients may be recruited to the study by those involved in their prior clinical care. The&#xD;
      investigators do not expect conflict of interest between research and healthcare duties for a&#xD;
      number of reasons: patients must give their full informed consent before entering the study,&#xD;
      specifically regarding the unknown efficacy of the study drug. Those patients who do not&#xD;
      continue in the study will maintain a relationship with the clinical team if required for&#xD;
      symptom control. At the end of the study, patients will be able to access the results if they&#xD;
      wish, through the Royal Marsden Website. They will also be sent a written summary of the&#xD;
      results if they indicate this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. Use of tissue samples in future research&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participants give their consent, any leftover blood or tissue samples which are not&#xD;
      required for this study will be stored for future unspecified research in line with the human&#xD;
      tissue act regulations. Access and use of samples for research purposes will require&#xD;
      appropriate ethical approval. Future researchers will not be able to identify individual&#xD;
      patients from their biobank data, demographic and clinical information will be available.&#xD;
