  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and function of the Aegis Sierra Ligation&#xD;
      System in accessing and closing off the left atrial appendage (LAA) using a minimally&#xD;
      invasive epicardial access approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A minimum of 30 participants will be included in this study, which is being performed at a&#xD;
      maximum of 8 centers in Canada and the United States. (A maximum of 15 participants at 4 US&#xD;
      centers will be enrolled)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be considered for this treatment if their doctor(s) have determined they&#xD;
      have documented non-valvular atrial fibrillation and are at increased risk for developing a&#xD;
      stroke.&#xD;

      Study Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this early feasibility study is to assess the safety and function of the&#xD;
      Aegis Sierra Ligation System (SLS) in ligating the left atrial appendage in patients with&#xD;
      non-valvular atrial fibrillation and at risk for stroke. The results of this trial will be&#xD;
      used to inform a larger pivotal trial that will allow for further health technology&#xD;
      assessment and for Medical Device License applications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, single-arm, open-label, multi-center study. This study will screen&#xD;
      patients with atrial fibrillation at risk for stroke. A minimum of 30 patients that meet all&#xD;
      of the study's inclusion criteria, none of the exclusion criteria and consent to study&#xD;
      participation will be enrolled. Patient accruement will take place at up to 8 North American&#xD;
      centers (A maximum of 15 participants at 4 US centers will be enrolled).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will undergo the following study visits: Screening, LAA ligation Procedure (Day&#xD;
      0) and Post-procedure, Hospital Discharge, Day 7, Day 30, Day 90, Day 180 and Day 365.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total duration of participation for subjects is anticipated to be 5 years post ligation&#xD;
      procedure with the primary safety outcome assessed at the 30-day follow-up and the secondary&#xD;
      endpoints assessed at Days 30, 180 and 365. Subjects will be also be contacted for an annual&#xD;
      telephone follow-up evaluation from years 2 through 5 to assess for patient-reported&#xD;
      long-term Major Adverse Events (MAE) and current health status.&#xD;
