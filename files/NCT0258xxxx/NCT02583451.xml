  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled, 4-period crossover study&#xD;
      of lemborexant in healthy adult and elderly subjects to evaluate driving performance&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will have 2 phases, Prerandomization and Randomization. The Prerandomization Phase&#xD;
      will consist of 2 periods that will last up to a maximum of 21 days: Screening and Baseline.&#xD;
      The Randomization Phase will comprise of four, 9-day treatment periods (Treatment Period 1 -&#xD;
      Treatment Period 4) with a minimum 14-day washout between treatment periods, and a follow-up&#xD;
      interval of at least 14 days after Treatment Period 4 before the end-of-study (EOS) visit.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to 1 of 12 sequences in an incomplete blocks design.&#xD;
