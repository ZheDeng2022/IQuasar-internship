      Study will be conducted for 12 weeks (+/-14 days) of monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BASELINE ASSESSMENTS Baseline assessment should be performed within 14 days of Week 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Signed informed consent;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. ECOG Performance Status per treating physician (chart abstraction of available data);&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Pathology report confirming cancer diagnosis;&#xD;

&#xD;
             1. Fitbit (PAM) devices will be provided by investigators for the period of the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Introduction to the device and instructions on use and care will be provided based&#xD;
                on commercial marketing material;&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Subjects will be assisted in setting up Fitbit device on smart phone;&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Subjects will be asked to wear Fitbit device continuously for 12 weeks - however,&#xD;
                the device should not be worn during bathing or showering;&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Subjects will be asked to sync their Fitbit devices to the database at least once a&#xD;
                week;&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Clinical coordinator may send phone or text reminders to encourage syncing as&#xD;
                Fitbit device can only record 1 weeks' worth of data;&#xD;
&#xD;
             7. Cost Coverage&#xD;
&#xD;
             8. Investigators will purchase devices prior to start of study with grant funding.&#xD;
&#xD;
             9. PAM Accountability&#xD;
&#xD;
            10. Investigator and investigator site are responsible for maintaining accurate&#xD;
                inventory and accountability logs for the devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
            11. Subjects will be asked to sign a form upon receipt and return of device as&#xD;
                applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. ECOG - Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status 0 - Fully active, able to&#xD;
           carry on all pre-disease performance without restriction; 1 - Restricted in physically&#xD;
           strenuous activity but ambulatory and able to carry out work of a light or sedentary&#xD;
           nature, e.g., light house work, office work; 2 - Ambulatory and capable of all self-care&#xD;
           but unable to carry out any work activities. Up and about more than 50% of waking hours;&#xD;
           3 - Capable of only limited self-care, confined to bed or chair more than 50% of waking&#xD;
           hours; 4 - Completely disabled -- cannot carry on any self-care. Totally confined to bed&#xD;
           or chair; 5 - Dead&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General (FACT-G).&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. The FACT-G is a 27-item scale designed to measure multidimensional quality of life in&#xD;
           breast cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology - Self-Rated (QIDS-SR116) .&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. The QIDS-SR16 is a 16-item version of the 30-item Inventory of Depressive&#xD;
           Symptomatology (IDS) designed to assess severity of depression-specific symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) (See Appendix H).9&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. The PSQI is a 19-item scale designed to assess sleep quality and disturbances.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) (See Appendix I).10&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. The BFI is a 9-item scale designed to assess fatigue in cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Biomarker and DNA Blood Tests&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Blood samples will be collected at each study visit indicated by the study&#xD;
                calendar. Process samples according to the sample processing instructions. Prior to&#xD;
                storage, complete the sample inventory logs for each subject so that specimen chain&#xD;
                of custody can be established. Samples will be frozen at -80Â°C until the time of&#xD;
                analysis;&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Include in each shipment batch copies of: 1) the blood collection source documents&#xD;
                for each patient; and 2) copies of each subjects specimen inventory form;&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Keep originals of these documents in the subject's chart;&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Samples will be analyzed using a multiplexed ELISA method (Meso Scale Discovery)&#xD;
                for IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-alpha;&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. With explicit participant consent, samples will also be processed for DNA and&#xD;
                stored for future analysis.&#xD;
