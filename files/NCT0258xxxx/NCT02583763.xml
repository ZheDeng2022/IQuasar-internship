  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim is to increase awareness of the relationship between (IUGR) and cardiac function in&#xD;
      the foetus, the development of cardiac function over time after delivery and what&#xD;
      significance a possible early disturbed myocardial function have for the neonate and the&#xD;
      child during the first years of life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective case-control study in which fetuses from normal pregnancies will be&#xD;
      compared with fetuses with IUGR. Parents will be asked to participate in the study in&#xD;
      connection with the routine ultrasound examinations at the department of obstetrics to where&#xD;
      they have been referred because of suspected IUGR. The control group will be randomly&#xD;
      selected among pregnant women who come for routine ultrasound during pregnancy at gestational&#xD;
      week 18-20.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surveys will be performed in the third trimester and after delivery. During the ultrasound&#xD;
      examinations standardized, moving sequences of the heart will be saved. Analyses will be&#xD;
      performed off-line and analysed by vector velocity imaging software. With this technique, the&#xD;
      investigator can quantify the chamber wall and myocardial movements. Speed (velocity),&#xD;
      movement (displacement) and thickening/deformation (strain and strain rate) will be recorded&#xD;
      in a structured and standardized manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When performing the analysis the heart's walls are outlined and the software extracts the&#xD;
      movement in different directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be obtained concerning the participating mothers previous illness, mothers' age,&#xD;
      maternal smoking, BMI, any abnormalities during pregnancy, number of previous pregnancies.&#xD;
      Other data that will be recorded are means of delivery and any abnormalities during previous&#xD;
      pregnancies, such as hypertension, preeclampsia and pre-natal steroid treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional data to be collected from the participating fetuses are flow profiles in the&#xD;
      umbilical artery, ductus venosus and middle cerebral artery. Abdominal circumference and&#xD;
      estimated weight will be registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following delivery, the participating child's height, weight, head circumference and&#xD;
      gestational age at birth are registered. Additional data that will be collected after&#xD;
      delivery are umbilical vein and umbilical artery acid base values, Apgar score. If admitted&#xD;
      to the pediatric ward the investigators will register the number of days hospitalized in the&#xD;
      ward for post-natal care and diagnosis. The investigators plan to examine the participating&#xD;
      baby with cardiac ultrasound between 12 and 72 hours after delivery and again when the&#xD;
      participating child is 3-4 months old and at 7 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will take a blood sample from the umbilical cord at birth and again at 7&#xD;
      years of age. The investigators will analyse the blood for growth factors and cardiac&#xD;
      markers. An additional ethical approval was accepted 2015 for analysing epigenetic factors in&#xD;
      the participating children's DNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on power calculation the investigators plan to examine between 20-30 fetuses with IUGR&#xD;
      and 40-60 healthy fetuses in the control group.&#xD;
