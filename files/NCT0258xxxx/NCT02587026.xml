      This is a tissue collection protocol to create an annotated biorepository to support future&#xD;
      basic and translational research. The study protocol and consent will request patient&#xD;
      permission to allow their specimens to be stored for future use in other&#xD;
      laboratory/correlative studies without requiring a separate new consent at a future date. It&#xD;
      will include also a retrospective review of all patients who have been seen or treated by the&#xD;
      Precision Genomics Clinic (waiver of consent requested). No specific research studies/aims&#xD;
      are included directly in this proposal. Use of the samples, data, and other resources (cell&#xD;
      lines, etc.) created within this protocol will require review/approval by the majority of the&#xD;
      Precision Genomics Investigators and appropriate IRB approval.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. ≥ 18 years old at the time of informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Ability to provide written informed consent and HIPAA authorization&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed malignancy or related&#xD;
             disorder. This includes patients with active disease as well as those in remission.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. One of the following tissue collection situations&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Group 1: Patients having tissue collection for clinical reasons who are willing&#xD;
                  to have additional specimens taken for research (biopsy may be done under local&#xD;
                  anesthesia, intravenous conscious sedation, or general anesthesia, as clinically&#xD;
                  indicated)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Group 2: Patients willing to undergo tissue collection for the purpose of&#xD;
                  research only (biopsy may be done under local anesthesia or intravenous conscious&#xD;
                  sedation per the judgment of the treating physician). This may include collection&#xD;
                  of additional samples from patients undergoing a study-specific research&#xD;
                  biopsy/procedure. Patients in group 2 may not undergo general anesthesia as part&#xD;
                  of this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Group 3: Patients having tissue collection for clinical reasons who are willing&#xD;
                  to have excess tissue (i.e., tissue that would have otherwise been discarded)&#xD;
                  banked for research (biopsy may be done under local anesthesia, intravenous&#xD;
                  conscious sedation, or general anesthesia, as clinically indicated).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Willingness to undergo phlebotomy for research blood samples Additional Criteria for&#xD;
             Patients in Groups 1 and 2&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. PT and PTT levels &lt; 1.2 x the institutional ULN (PT, PTT not required for skin&#xD;
             biopsies)&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Not receiving therapeutic anticoagulation&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Platelets ≥ 100 x 109/L&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Concurrent disease or condition that would make the patient inappropriate for study&#xD;
             participation or any serious medical or psychiatric disorder that would interfere with&#xD;
             the subject's safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Dementia, altered mental status, or any psychiatric condition that would prohibit the&#xD;
             understanding or rendering of informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. History of serious or life-threatening allergic reaction to local anesthetics (i.e.&#xD;
             lidocaine, xylocaine)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Any other condition, which in the opinion of the patient's treating oncologist or the&#xD;
             physician performing the biopsy procedure, would make participation in this protocol&#xD;
             unreasonably hazardous for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Additional Criteria for Patients in Group 1 and 2&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Pregnant women are excluded from Groups 1 and 2 because there may be an increased risk&#xD;
             to both mother and fetus in the setting of conscious sedation, which is required for&#xD;
             biopsies of certain anatomic sites (e.g. liver, lung, bone). Also, ionizing radiation&#xD;
             from CT-guided biopsies may pose a risk to the unborn fetus.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients in Groups 1 and 2 may not have active cardiac disease, defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  History of uncontrolled or symptomatic angina&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  History of arrhythmias requiring medications, or clinically significant&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Myocardial infarction &lt; 6 months from study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Uncontrolled or symptomatic congestive heart failure&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Any other cardiac condition, which in the opinion of the treating physician,&#xD;
                  would make this protocol unreasonably hazardous for the patient&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients in group 1 and 2 receiving bevacizumab or other angiogenesis inhibitors (or&#xD;
             less than 6 weeks from last dose of an angiogenesis inhibitor) should not undergo a&#xD;
             research core liver biopsy on this protocol because of the concern for the possibility&#xD;
             of increased bleeding risk. Patients may undergo a research fine needle aspiration&#xD;
             (FNA) of the liver as an alternative. Patients may also undergo core research biopsies&#xD;
             of other sites, up to the discretion of the treating physician, but physicians should&#xD;
             take the potential increased bleeding and/or delayed wound healing issues into&#xD;
             consideration.&#xD;
