  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research study is to test the feasibility of an intervention programme to&#xD;
      reduce cognitive impairment due to cancer treatment. The investigators want to find out how&#xD;
      acceptable the intervention and procedures are for cancer patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The intervention programme will consist of the following components: education about&#xD;
      cancer-related cognitive impairment, relaxation techniques, compensatory techniques,&#xD;
      goal-setting and lifestyle advice. Each session will last between 90 and 120 minutes, once a&#xD;
      week for six weeks. The intervention will be delivered in a group setting, in a non-clinical&#xD;
      environment by the investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to recruit 54 cancer patients from the local Cancer Centre onto the&#xD;
      study. The cognitive functioning of cancer patients due to start chemotherapy will be&#xD;
      assessed. Each patient's cognitive function will be reassessed after completion of&#xD;
      chemotherapy and additional self-report measures will be administered. Patients who&#xD;
      demonstrate cognitive decline over the course of chemotherapy will be invited to take part in&#xD;
      the intervention programme. All other patients will be given an information sheet and advised&#xD;
      to contact a member of their health-care team if they notice any changes in their cognitive&#xD;
      function. The investigators aim to take 30 patients through the intervention. At the end of&#xD;
      the intervention, each participant will complete an intervention evaluation questionnaire in&#xD;
      addition to the cognitive functioning assessments and self-report measures.&#xD;

    <description>The investigators aim to assess the acceptability of the intervention programme and its procedures to patients enrolled in the study. This is a non-validated questionnaire designed specifically for this study. Participants are required to rate the verbal and written information about the study, advice about the study, overall intervention, specific intervention components, each assessment visit and procedure, length of time of intervention and assessment visits on a three- or five-point likert scale. Open-ended questions asking participants to provide further information were provided.</description>

    <description>Each participant will complete neuropsychological assessments at baseline (prior to chemotherapy) and after chemotherapy. Patients identified as experiencing cognitive decline measured using Reliable Change Index on at least one cognitive function measure from before until after chemotherapy will be offered the intervention. Participants in the interventions will complete a neuropsychological assessment after completion of the intervention. Questionnaires to assess other non-cognitive factors e.g. quality-of-life will be administered at the end of chemotherapy to all participants and after the intervention to participants in the intervention.</description>
