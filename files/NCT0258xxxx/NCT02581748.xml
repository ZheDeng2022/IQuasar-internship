             half-lives of the drug or supplement, or within 2 weeks prior to taking IP (whichever&#xD;
             is longer). Herbal supplements must be discontinued 28 days prior to the IP&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. History of a blood donation within 3 months prior to the administration of IP&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Have participated in any other clinical study within 3 months prior to the&#xD;
             administration of IP&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Have positive test results for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis C virus&#xD;
             (HCV) antibodies, or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibodies&#xD;
