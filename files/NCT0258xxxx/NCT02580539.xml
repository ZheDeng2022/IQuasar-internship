      This study evaluates the safety and efficacy of EBV-specific T-cell lines to treat patients&#xD;
      suffering from high EBV viral titers not responding to standard of care therapies and to&#xD;
      treat EBV-related lymphoma. The study will recruit 6 patients to receive autologous T cells&#xD;
      or a T cell line derived from the patient's allogeneic donor (in the case of stem cell&#xD;
      transplant recipients), and 6 patients to receive a T-cell line prepared from a matched or&#xD;
      partially matched related donor.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a member of the herpes virus family and infects up to 95% of&#xD;
      individuals over their lifetime. Most initial infections occur in childhood and after a brief&#xD;
      flu-like illness, the virus enters a phase of latency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who receive a bone marrow transplant or an organ transplant take medications drugs&#xD;
      that weaken their immune systems. In these contexts, the virus can &quot;reactivate&quot; and cause&#xD;
      very serious problems, such as lymphoma. For unknown reasons, people with a normal immune&#xD;
      system can also develop lymphoma due to EBV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and efficacy of immune cells (T lymphocytes)&#xD;
      that are specifically &quot;taught&quot; to recognize the virus-infected cells and to eliminate them.&#xD;
      This &quot;education&quot; occurs is done over during a 2 weeks period (approximately), in the research&#xD;
      laboratory. The cells are then transfused into the patient.&#xD;
