  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GAX represents a novel approach to the development of cancer chemotherapy agents in&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer and is based upon extensive laboratory investigations for the induction of&#xD;
      apoptosis in pancreatic carcinoma cells.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is the investigators expectation that this combination will induce apoptotic pathways&#xD;
      downstream of biochemical mechanisms of resistance and synergistically induce pathways for&#xD;
      apoptosis that are non-p53 dependent, which have not been previously explored in chemotherapy&#xD;
      trials for this cancer. ABRAXANE® is novel in that it induces apoptosis to the same degree in&#xD;
      mutant and wt p53 cancers. Mutant p53 tumors occur in 80-90% of PC and mutant p53 is thought&#xD;
      of as one of the major mechanisms of drug resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, the investigators will be starting Xeloda and gemcitabine at slightly lower&#xD;
      doses than the initial GTX studies. This is because the investigators have found that the&#xD;
      efficacy is maintained at these slightly lower doses while side effects are minimized. The&#xD;
      reason that GTX works at lower doses, as well as higher doses, is the synergy between drugs.&#xD;
      Drug regimens that are synergistic can maintain their antitumor effect at doses lower than in&#xD;
      non-synergistic regimens, but must maintain their dose intensity to achieve their anti-tumor&#xD;
      effect. RECIST 1.1 criteria will be utilized for judging response, progression and stable&#xD;
      disease. Overall assessment of the data will be by intention to treat analysis (ITT).&#xD;
