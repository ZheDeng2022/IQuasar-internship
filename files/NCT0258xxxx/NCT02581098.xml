    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine if elevated wound-edge endothelial miR-200b is a barrier to&#xD;
      wound healing in diabetic patients and also to determine if ex vivo supplementation of miR-21&#xD;
      mimic and recombinant MFG-E8 resolve inflammation in wound macrophages isolated from NPWT&#xD;
      sponges from diabetic wounds. This study will enroll 124 (60 in the miR-200b arm and 64 in&#xD;
      the miR21 arm) Diabetic Wound patients who have wound tissue oxygenation adequate to support&#xD;
      wound healing and will be in the study for 14 weeks that includes 4 study visits.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed as a 14 week prospective observational study where patients with&#xD;
      diabetic wounds visiting the Indiana University Health Comprehensive Wound Center (CWC) will&#xD;
      be enrolled. Patients enrolled will be followed for 14 weeks including 4 study visits,&#xD;
      initial visit (week 0), study visit 2 (week 2), study visit 3 (week 4), and will return for a&#xD;
      final follow-up study visit 4 (week 14; miR-200b arm only). Standardized Care Outline will be&#xD;
      per physician discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial visit will take place during the patients regularly scheduled CWC visit and the&#xD;
      following will take place: informed consent will be obtained, baseline demographics and&#xD;
      medical history with be collected, current labs and medications will be recorded, wound data&#xD;
      will be obtained, an ankle brachial index will be completed for patients with leg wounds&#xD;
      below the knee, if not already completed per Standard of Care (SoC) since onset of the wound,&#xD;
      and wound photographs for digital planimetry to measure wound area. Wound fluid will be&#xD;
      collected using a filter paper method, aspiration method, or via the NPWT (Negative Pressure&#xD;
      Wound Therapy, also known as Wound Vac) sponge prior to debridement. Additionally, two 3 mm&#xD;
      punch tissue biopsies will be obtained from the patient's physician; however, this is&#xD;
      optional. If the wound shows signs of healing and does not show signs of infection (i.e. the&#xD;
      wound has not stalled in healing for 2 or more weeks or become larger in size) or the wound&#xD;
      has been declared healed by their physician, the biopsies will not be obtained. The study&#xD;
      visits 2-4 will include the following: a medication and adverse event review, wound data will&#xD;
      be recorded, wound photographs, wound fluid, and two 3 mm punch tissue biopsies will be&#xD;
      obtained from the patient's physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Risks:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risks associated with this research study are low. There are no therapeutic interventions&#xD;
      or medications as part of this study to be administered depending on the amount of sensation&#xD;
      the subject has at the site of the wound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the subject is receiving a biopsy, the wound site will be numbed by applying local&#xD;
      anesthesia as appropriate to the area being biopsied. There may be some discomfort with the&#xD;
      tissue biopsy procedure, but all reasonable efforts will be made to minimize pain. The biopsy&#xD;
      procedure is done within the boundaries of the existing wound to avoid giving the patient a&#xD;
      separate new wound. Bleeding is a possible complication, but the risk is low for the small&#xD;
      biopsies and is reduced by using local anesthetics with epinephrine, and silver nitrate&#xD;
      sticks are available in each room to cauterize biopsy sites as needed. Infection is also a&#xD;
      potential risk; however, wound tissue biopsies are routinely performed as the standard of&#xD;
      care in the CWC to diagnose wound infection. The biopsy site will be appropriately monitored&#xD;
      for infection by the physician managing the wound during routine wound clinic visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ABI test may result in temporary discomfort around the ankle or foot when the cuff is&#xD;
      inflated, but does not present any further physical or medical risks. The wound fluid&#xD;
      collection is non-invasive and does not present any risk. Study participants will not benefit&#xD;
      directly from participation in this study. This research information has the potential of&#xD;
      providing considerable benefits to wound care by identifying a key player that influences the&#xD;
      closure of chronic diabetic wounds. Such knowledge should help develop novel biomarker and or&#xD;
      miR-directed therapeutic strategies.&#xD;
