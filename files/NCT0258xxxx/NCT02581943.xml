    <textblock>
      This randomized pilot phase II trial studies the effect of pembrolizumab with or without&#xD;
      carboplatin and paclitaxel on immune response in patients with non-small cell lung cancer&#xD;
      that has come back or stage IIIB-IV. Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may&#xD;
      interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Drugs used in chemotherapy,&#xD;
      such as carboplatin and paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,&#xD;
      either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from&#xD;
      spreading. Giving pembrolizumab together with carboplatin and paclitaxel may improve immune&#xD;
      responses in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the immune effects of single agent pembrolizumab and pembrolizumab combined with&#xD;
      low-dose carboplatin and paclitaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Estimate the treatment response to single agent pembrolizumab and pembrolizumab combined&#xD;
      with low-dose carboplatin and paclitaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the toxicity and tolerability of pembrolizumab and pembrolizumab combined with&#xD;
      low-dose carboplatin and paclitaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Assess quality of life (QOL) in patients receiving single agent pembrolizumab and&#xD;
      pembrolizumab combined with carboplatin and paclitaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Assess the association between immune response and clinical response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1, paclitaxel IV over 1 hour&#xD;
      and carboplatin IV over 1 hour on days 1, 7 and 14.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both arms, courses repeat every 3 weeks for 2 years in the absence of disease progression&#xD;
      or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for at least 30 days and then&#xD;
      every 8 weeks thereafter.&#xD;
