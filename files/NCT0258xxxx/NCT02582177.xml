      To evaluate the no-inferiority of the ketoconazole20mg/g and betamethasone dipropionate 0.64&#xD;
      mg/g association (Candicort®) cream versus clotrimazole 10mg and dexamethasone acetate 0.443&#xD;

      Candicort® presents formulation with agents that act both etiological agent of superficial&#xD;
      mycosis, with coverage for dermatophytes and more frequent yeast; as inflammation generated&#xD;
      by the infectious process or prior to it, in cases of secondary fungal infection in wet or&#xD;
      potentially infected eczema fungal dermatitis (atopic dermatitis, seborrhoeic dermatitis,&#xD;
      intertrigo, dyshidrosis, contact dermatitis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The active ingredients ketoconazole and betamethasone act, respectively, on the etiologic&#xD;
      agent of the infection and the inflammation generated by the process, and the association of&#xD;
      both showed a positive therapeutic response in dermatitis with confirmed secondary infections&#xD;
      or potential yeast (analysis carried out in association with sulfate neomycin, aimed to cover&#xD;
      bacterial infections together).&#xD;
&#xD;
      160 participants that meet all the inclusion criteria and are not classified in any of the&#xD;
      exclusion criteria will be randomly allocated to one of two treatment groups(Candicort® or&#xD;
      Baycuten N®) of the study.&#xD;

    <description>Percentage change in the total score of signs and symptoms (erythema, maceration, peeling, blistering /papules /pustules, itching and burning/ stinging) in 6 (±1) days after onset first stage of treatment in relation to the basal.&#xD;
The total score will be established by the sum of individual scores of the signs and symptoms assessed by the four-point categorical scale (0=absent, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe), ranging from 0 to 18 points.&#xD;
The percentage change in the total score of signs and symptoms will be calculated by the following expression:&#xD;
VTSS(%) = [(TSS0 -TSS6)/ TSS0]*100&#xD;
TSS0: total score of signs and symptoms (erythema, maceration, peeling, blistering /papules /pustules, itching and burning/ stinging) in 0 day.&#xD;
