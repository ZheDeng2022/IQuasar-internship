  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In last few years, most researches about hepatic complication after chemotherapy focused on&#xD;
      hepatitis B virus (HBV). With adequate prophylaxis and monitor, HBV-related hepatitis flares&#xD;
      can be prevented. In contrast, cancer patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are&#xD;
      traditionally considered as relative safe to receive chemotherapy. However, two large&#xD;
      retrospective studies recently showed that severe hepatitis could develop in 14-27% lymphoma&#xD;
      patients with chronic HCV infection, including 3-4% hepatic failure. The risk factors to&#xD;
      predict severe hepatitis are pre-treatment elevated ALT level and liver cirrhosis. Due to the&#xD;
      lack of prospective studies, the dynamic changes of serum HCV RNA levels and the association&#xD;
      of hepatitis are still unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some epidemiologic studies demonstrated an association between HCV infection and B-cell&#xD;
      lymphoma. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common lymphoma and several&#xD;
      reports showed higher prevalence of HCV infection among DLBCL patients than the controls. HCV&#xD;
      infected DLBCL patients are reported to have distinct clinical characteristics, such as&#xD;
      older, more with elevated LDH levels, and more with extra-nodal involvement. Regarding the&#xD;
      impact of HCV infection on prognosis, the results are conflicting. Taiwan is an endemic area&#xD;
      of HCV but there are limited reports addressing the clinical characteristics and prognosis in&#xD;
      this unique population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators initiate a prospective, multi-center observational study to&#xD;
      clarify the dynamic association between serum HCV RNA levels and hepatitis in HCV-infected&#xD;
      lymphoma patients treated with chemotherapy.&#xD;
