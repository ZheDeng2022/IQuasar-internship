  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) have been epidemiologically linked to serious health&#xD;
      problems including heart disease, liver disease, and diabetes. This study will recruit&#xD;
      frequent SSB drinkers who are employees at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF)&#xD;
      and measure markers of metabolic health on two occasions, 10 months apart. During this time,&#xD;
      UCSF will cease selling SSBs at all campus and medical center locations. Additionally, at the&#xD;
      first assessment half of participants will be randomly assigned to a brief intervention to&#xD;
      help reduce SSB consumption, consisting of a 10-20 minute semi-structured interview designed&#xD;
      to share health information about SSBs, elicit motivations to reduce consumption, and help&#xD;
      set concrete plans to reduce consumption. The investigators will be able to compare changes&#xD;
      in metabolic health among those who do and do not reduce SSB consumption. This will make a&#xD;
      unique contribution to the growing evidence regarding both the effects of SSB consumption on&#xD;
      health and the modifiability of SSB-related health conditions.&#xD;

      Sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) have been epidemiologically linked to serious health&#xD;
      problems including heart disease, liver disease, and diabetes. This study will recruit&#xD;
      frequent SSB drinkers who are employees at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF)&#xD;
      and measure markers of metabolic health on two occasions, 10 months apart. During this time,&#xD;
      UCSF will cease selling SSBs at all campus and medical center locations. Additionally, at the&#xD;
      first assessment half of participants will be randomly assigned to a brief intervention to&#xD;
      help reduce SSB consumption, consisting of a 10-20 minute semi-structured interview designed&#xD;
      to share health information about SSBs, elicit motivations to reduce consumption, and help&#xD;
      set concrete plans to reduce consumption. We will be able to compare changes in metabolic&#xD;
      health among those who do and do not reduce SSB consumption. This will make a unique&#xD;
      contribution to the growing evidence regarding both the effects of SSB consumption on health&#xD;
      and the modifiability of SSB-related health conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two key clarifications about the design of this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The cessation of sugar-sweetened beverage sales is a pre-existing workplace initiative.&#xD;
           This study is taking advantage of its initiation but it is not part of the study&#xD;
           intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The primary predictor in this study is SSB consumption, not condition assignment.&#xD;
           Although we will report on the efficacy of the brief intervention, the main goal of the&#xD;
           study is to examine the correlational relationship between changes in SSB consumption&#xD;
           and changes in health, whether the reduction is associated with the intervention or with&#xD;
           other factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. For all outcomes other than sugar consumption and SSB consumption (see below), the&#xD;
           primary analytic strategy will be to correlate changes in SSB consumption with changes&#xD;
           in the outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. We will additionally assess the efficacy of the university initiative and the brief&#xD;
           counseling intervention using a linear mixed regression model estimating the effects of&#xD;
           1) time (pre to post), representing the effect of the university SSB initiative, and 2)&#xD;
           assignment to the brief intervention interacting with time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For both types of analysis, we will include demographic and job-related covariates based on&#xD;
      fit criteria to guide model selection.&#xD;
