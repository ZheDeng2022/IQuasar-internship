      This study will evaluate the effect of circadian misalignment on insulin sensitivity in&#xD;
      healthy lean subjects in a randomized cross-over design. Subjects will be admitted to the&#xD;
      research facility for two study periods of 3 and 3.5 days. In one of the study periods, the&#xD;
      behavioral cycle will be shifted by 12 hours. Insulin sensitivity will be measured with a&#xD;
      hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent evidence shows that misalignment of the circadian rhythm (e.g. by rotating shift work)&#xD;
      impairs glucose metabolism markedly, possibly by decreasing insulin sensitivity in peripheral&#xD;
      tissues and liver. Nowadays our society is indispensably connected to a lifestyle that allows&#xD;
      wakefulness at every time of the 24 hours cycle. Social jetlag is a phenomenon that affects a&#xD;
      large part of the general population, thus circadian misalignment extends far beyond those&#xD;
      who are on a shift work schedule. Therefore, decreased insulin sensitivity in individuals&#xD;
      affected by circadian misalignment may help to explain the increased prevalence of T2DM in&#xD;
      night shift workers that has been found in epidemiological studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is an interventional randomized crossover trial in which each subject serves as it&#xD;
      owns control. For the study, the investigators ask the subjects to participate in two study&#xD;
      periods, one of 3 days length (control condition) and the other of 3.5 days length&#xD;
      (misalignment condition). During the 3.5 day misalignment condition, subjects will shift&#xD;
      their day-night rhythm by 12 hours, which will lead to maximal circadian misalignment.&#xD;
      Insulin sensitivity will be measured by a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp. Secondary&#xD;
      parameters will include ex-vivo skeletal muscle mitochondrial function and whole-body energy&#xD;
      metabolism.&#xD;
