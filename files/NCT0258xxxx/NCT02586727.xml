  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to assess the safety of intravitreal aflibercept&#xD;
      injection in treating visually compromising radiation maculopathy secondary to treatment of&#xD;
      uveal melanoma by iodione-125 brachytherapy. The study will consist of two arms of 25&#xD;
      patients each (totaling 50 patients). Subjects in arm 1 will undergo treatment every 6 weeks.&#xD;
      Subjects in arm 2 will undergo treatment and if improvement is documented at the following&#xD;
      evaluation the next treatment will be extended by two weeks. Secondary objectives of the&#xD;
      study include evaluation and analysis of visual acuity, number of injections, macular edema,&#xD;
      and vascular activity between both arms.&#xD;

      This study will consist of 2 simultaneous treatment arms: A six week dosing regimen arm and a&#xD;
      treat and extend (TAE) dosing regimen arm, total duration 54 weeks. In the TAE arm the&#xD;
      patients will receive an intravitreal aflibercept injection first visit, again at the second&#xD;
      visit at 6 weeks, and then begin treat and extend from second injection forward. Treatment&#xD;
      will be given at each visit. Patients with improved radiation maculopathy (SD-OCT analysis)&#xD;
      will extend re-evaluation by two weeks (e.g. first interval 6 weeks; second interval 10&#xD;
      weeks; third interval 12 weeks, etc). Patients with increased radiation maculopathy (SD-OCT&#xD;
      analysis) will have re-evaluation decreased by one week. Both arms will consist of 25&#xD;
      subjects (eyes). Fluorescein angiography will be completed at baseline, after the 4th&#xD;
      injection (or within three weeks of week 24 for the TAE arm), and at the end of the study in&#xD;
      all patients. Spectral domain OCT, and clinical evaluation including visual acuity will be&#xD;
      assessed every visit in all patients. Radiation maculopathy will be graded every visit in all&#xD;
      patients in a blinded fashion using the following classification system: Grade 1 indicates&#xD;
      extrafoveal, noncystoid edema; grade 2, extrafoveal cystoid edema; grade 3, foveal noncystoid&#xD;
      edema; grade 4, mild-to-moderate foveal cystoid edema; grade 5, severe foveal cystoid edema&#xD;
      and grade 6 subretinal fluid. All patients will undergo comprehensive evaluation including&#xD;
      adverse event questioning at each study timepoint. Patients in the six-week dosing arm will&#xD;
      receive a total of 9 intravitreal aflibercept injections during the study window while the&#xD;
      TAE treatment group will receive a maximum of 9 with a minimum of 5.&#xD;
