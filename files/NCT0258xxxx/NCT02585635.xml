    <textblock>
      The MOrPH study is designed to identify optimal prophylaxis schedules for children with&#xD;
      haemophilia. This involves development of combined pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic&#xD;
      models. Interpretation of model outputs will be informed by two surveys. The first will&#xD;
      survey families of children with haemophilia to ascertain families' values and preferences&#xD;
      concerning prophylaxis schedules. The second will survey haemophilia physicians to ascertain&#xD;
      the criteria physicians use to prescribe prophylaxis schedules.&#xD;

      Methods: Part I (surveys)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two cross-sectional surveys will be conducted, a family survey and a clinician survey. The&#xD;
      surveys will be completed online. Participation will be voluntary and anonymous.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Family survey. The family survey will identify preferences of families of children with&#xD;
      haemophilia for different prophylaxis schedules. At least 20 families will participate. This&#xD;
      number should provide a clear indication of family's preferences for different prophylaxis&#xD;
      schedules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People will be eligible to participate in the family survey if they have haemophilia A or B&#xD;
      and are aged between 14 and 17 years, or if they are the parent of a child (&lt; 18 years) with&#xD;
      haemophilia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited using advertisements placed in community print-based and/or&#xD;
      electronic communications and, if necessary, by inviting families attending a youth camp for&#xD;
      people with haemophilia. The survey will ask participants about the characteristics of the&#xD;
      child with haemophilia including the child's age, current level and frequency of physical&#xD;
      activity and sports participation, current prophylactic medication schedule and method of&#xD;
      administration. They will also be asked to rate the acceptability of a number of possible&#xD;
      prophylactic schedules as &quot;acceptable&quot;, &quot;marginally acceptable&quot; or &quot;unacceptable&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinician survey. The second survey will be of physicians. To be eligible, participants must&#xD;
      be physicians currently practising in paediatric haemophilia treatment centres. Participants&#xD;
      will be asked to rank factors that influence their decision making when advising patients&#xD;
      regarding prophylactic scheduling. These factors include: cost, tolerability for families,&#xD;
      venous access, physical activity and sport, pharmacokinetics, inhibitor development and age.&#xD;
      They will also be asked to report on which prophylactic schedules they would considerable&#xD;
      unacceptable, putting aside issues regarding efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Part II (modelling)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MOrPH project will use pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modelling to identify optimal&#xD;
      prophylaxis schedules. Conventional pharmacokinetic models will be used to identify&#xD;
      prophylaxis schedules that maximise time above threshold and minimise trough values of&#xD;
      clotting factor concentrates. In addition, pharmacodynamic models will be developed to&#xD;
      provide child-specific predictions of the risk of bleeds as a function of prophylaxis&#xD;
      schedules. The pharmacodynamic models will be used to identify prophylaxis schedules that&#xD;
      minimise risk of bleeds.&#xD;
