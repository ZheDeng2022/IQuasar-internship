  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Crestal bone and soft tissue stability around implants is an important issue in implant&#xD;
      dentistry. Initial vertical mucosal tissue thickness was shown to be one of the factors&#xD;
      having impact on bone stability. However, there is lack of data in the literature regarding&#xD;
      the relationship between mucosal thickness and marginal bone loss around implants. Berglundh&#xD;
      and Lindhe in an animal study reported that thin mucosal tissue causes significantly more&#xD;
      crestal bone resorption around implants. In addition, clinical research regarding the effects&#xD;
      of tissue thickness on bone and soft tissue stability around implants is lacking. The aim of&#xD;
      this clinical study is to evaluate the influence of mucosal tissue thickness on soft and hard&#xD;
      tissue changes around implants.&#xD;

      The objectives of this clinical study are;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to evaluate the influence of mucosal tissue thickness on periimplant soft and hard&#xD;
           tissue changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to evaluate whether acellular dermal matrix (ADM) derived allogenic membrane or&#xD;
           subepithelial connective tissue grafts performed at implant placement could be effective&#xD;
           in vertical soft tissue augmentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to evaluate the influence of vertical soft tissue augmentation with acellular dermal&#xD;
           matrix or subepithelial connective tissue grafts on soft and hard tissue changes around&#xD;
           implants with platform switching after 1 year of loading.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Partially edentulous patients in the posterior lower jaw area requiring implant treatment&#xD;
      will be recruited for this study. There will be four groups in the study with 35 patients in&#xD;
      each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria will be; (1) &gt;18 years of age; (2) no medical contraindication for implant&#xD;
      surgery; (3) missing teeth in the posterior mandibular area requiring two implants supported&#xD;
      three unit bridge prosthetic restoration; (4) fully healed bone sites (at least 3 months&#xD;
      after extraction) (5) minimum of 6mm bone width and 10 mm bone height above inferior alveolar&#xD;
      canal; (6) healthy soft tissue; (7) minimum 2mm keratinized gingiva; (8) no bone augmentation&#xD;
      procedures before and during implant placement. The patients will be excluded if they will&#xD;
      not meet inclusion criteria and additionally have (1) poor oral hygiene; (2) uncontrolled&#xD;
      periodontitis (3) smoking Ethical approval was taken from Cukurova University Ethical&#xD;
      Committee and the patients will sign informed consent form before participating in the study.&#xD;
      Cone beam computerized tomography will be taken from all patients in order to evaluate the&#xD;
      future implant sites. Patients will be enrolled if they fulfill the inclusion criteria.&#xD;
      Patients will be excluded if they will not meet inclusion criteria and additionally have&#xD;
      exclusion criteria. Two implants per patient will be placed. The prosthetic restorations will&#xD;
      be performed as three unit bridge with two supported implants. These two implants in the&#xD;
      premolar and molar regions will be included into the study and evaluated independently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One hour prior to surgery the patients will receive prophylactic dose of 1 g&#xD;
      amoxicillin+clavulanic acid. All surgical procedures will be performed by two experienced&#xD;
      surgeons under local anesthesia. A mid-crestal incision on the center of edentulous ridge&#xD;
      will be performed, leaving at least width of 2 mm keratinized tissues buccally. Next, a&#xD;
      full-thickness buccal flap will be raised, while lingual part will not be elevated to ensure&#xD;
      direct visibility. Vertical thickness of soft tissues will be measured with 1.0 mm marked&#xD;
      periodontal probe. The probe will be positioned in an upright position to the bone crest in&#xD;
      the center of the future implant placement. After measurement, lingual flap will be raised to&#xD;
      completely expose the implantation site. If vertical soft tissue thickness is 2 mm or less,&#xD;
      tissues will be considered as thin. If soft tissue thickness is more than 2mm, tissues will&#xD;
      be considered as thick. There will be four groups in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: implants placed in naturally thick tissues (&gt;2mm) (control group). Group 2: implants&#xD;
      placed in thin tissues (≤2mm) Group 3: vertical soft tissue augmentation in thin tissues&#xD;
      (≤2mm) with subepithelial connective tissue graft (SCTG) simultaneously with implant&#xD;
      placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 4: vertical soft tissue augmentation in thin tissues (≤2mm) with AlloDerm® Regenerative&#xD;
      Tissue Matrix simultaneously with implant placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implants with platform switching (Astra Tech Implant System EV) will be placed and cover&#xD;
      screws will be inserted. In group 3, vertical soft tissue augmentation will be performed with&#xD;
      SCTG. In group 4, AlloDerm® RTM, Thick 1 x 4 cm will be used according to manufacturer's&#xD;
      recommendations for vertical soft tissue augmentation. The flaps will be closed primarily&#xD;
      with 4/0 sutures in all groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be instructed to rinse the operated site with antiseptic mouthwash twice a day&#xD;
      and prescribed 1 g of amoxicillin+clavulanic acid twice a day for a week. For pain control,&#xD;
      patients will receive 500 mg of flurbiprofen as needed. The sutures will be removed 7-10 days&#xD;
      after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 3 months of healing second stage surgery will be scheduled under local anesthesia. A&#xD;
      mid-crestal incision will be performed in the center of the bone crest. A full-thickness&#xD;
      buccal flap will be raised, and thickness of augmented soft tissues over the center of the&#xD;
      implant will be measured with a periodontal probe. After raising the lingual flap Astra Tech&#xD;
      healing uni EV will be connected to the implant. Flap will be closed with sutures and the&#xD;
      sutures will be removed 7 days after surgery. After 14 days of healing Astra Tech uni&#xD;
      abutment EV will be connected to the implant and abjutment disconnection will not be&#xD;
      performed in order to avoid disruption of the peri-implant seal during abutment unscrewing.&#xD;
      Screw retained fixed prosthesis with metal ceramic restoration will be connected to the&#xD;
      implant after 6 weeks of healing. Plaque Index (PI), Gingival Index (GI), Probing Pocket&#xD;
      Depth (PPD), Bleeding on Probing (BOP), will be evaluated at prosthetic delivery, 6 months&#xD;
      and 12 months after loading.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiological evaluation and measurements will be performed to calculate the mesial and distal&#xD;
      crestal bone changes around implants. Intraoral digital radiographs by using paralleling&#xD;
      technique will be taken from patients (i) after implant placement, (ii) after 3 months of&#xD;
      healing, (iii) after prosthetic delivery, (iv) after 6 and (v) 12 months of loading. The&#xD;
      measurements will be performed using Image J analysis software program (Image J version&#xD;
      1.44-National Institutes of Health, NIH) by an examiner who is unaware of the group&#xD;
      assignment. The intra-examiner agreement will be determined by second and third measurements&#xD;
      with 1- month interval. The mean difference between measurements will be calculated and the&#xD;
      mean of three measurements will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 280 implants in 140 patients with 35 patients in each group will be included in&#xD;
      the study according to the results of power analysis. Finally, it will be a patient based&#xD;
      study design. Data will be analyzed using SPSS 21.0 (Chicago, IL, USA). Descriptive&#xD;
      statistics will be calculated for the measurements as means, SEs, SDs, medians, and range of&#xD;
      the measurements. The normality of the distribution will be tested using Kolmogorov Smirnov&#xD;
      (P=0.05). One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey HSD tests will be used to compare the group means.&#xD;
      As an alternative, Kruskal Wallis H test followed by Mann Whitney U test will be used in case&#xD;
      if nonparametric analysis is needed.&#xD;
