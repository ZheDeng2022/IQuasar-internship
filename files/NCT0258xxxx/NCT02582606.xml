      In this study investigators will compare the health effect of two different meal patterns. In&#xD;
      one, participants will consume food according to an 'irregular meal pattern' (minimum 3&#xD;
      meals, maximum 9 meals per day) and in the other 'regular meal pattern' (6 meals per day) for&#xD;
      two weeks. The energy requirement of the participants will be calculated to maintain body&#xD;
      weight during the study. Participants will be provided with all the food to be consumed&#xD;
      during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially, interested individuals will attend a screening visit in which they will complete&#xD;
      questionnaires on medical health, eating habits and physical activity. Height, weight and&#xD;
      waist circumference will be measured at this visit. Thereafter, participants will be assigned&#xD;
      to a 2-week period following one of the two meal-patterns. There will be a 2-week period&#xD;
      between the two interventions when they will consume their normal diet and at the end of&#xD;
      this, participants will undertake the next meal pattern. During the two phases participants&#xD;
      will be asked to wear an armband (which detects movement and measures heat loss), to assess&#xD;
      their energy expenditure and an interstitial glucose monitoring device will be worn for seven&#xD;
      days. Before and after each 2-week intervention, participants will come to the laboratory for&#xD;
      a mixed-meal tolerance test. Blood samples will be obtained before and for 3hrs after eating&#xD;
      to evaluate the health effects of the meal patterns. Energy expenditure will be measured by&#xD;
      ventilated-hood indirect calorimetry and the armband device. At the end of the 3hr post&#xD;
      prandial period, participants will be offered an ad libitum pasta lunch and be asked to eat&#xD;
      until they feel comfortably full.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each of the 2-week periods, participants will be asked to record their food intake and&#xD;
      record their appetite sensations on specific days.&#xD;

      Background. Greater variation in meal pattern from day to day might affect energy balance&#xD;
      and, in consequence, the control of body weight. However, studies which have evaluated the&#xD;
      impact of an irregular meal pattern on energy metabolism, in adults, are few. Several&#xD;
      experimental studies by Farshchi et al. have shown that there are potentially important&#xD;
      negative health consequences associated with erratic/irregular eating patterns. Higher&#xD;
      fasting levels of total-cholesterol and low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, a decrease&#xD;
      in thermic effect of food (TEF), and reduced insulin sensitivity, were observed in healthy&#xD;
      women after 14 days of irregular eating. Subsequent studies have confirmed this in overweight&#xD;
      subjects and also provided evidence of alterations in subjective appetite which may influence&#xD;
      ad-libitum food intake (Lara et al, unpublished).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, experimenters have shown a decrease in thermogenesis in response to a test meal,&#xD;
      and greater postprandial blood glucose concentration in 11 normal weight women following&#xD;
      two-weeks of irregular eating in contrast to a regular pattern.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study will study the effect of an irregular meal pattern in obese women who&#xD;
      demonstrate fasting insulin resistance (IR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      to investigate the effects of meal pattern on energy expenditure, postprandial thermogenesis,&#xD;
      postprandial blood glucose, fasting lipid profile and fasting insulin sensitivity in obese&#xD;
      women with insulin resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental protocol. 10 women with a homeostatic model assessment - insulin resistance&#xD;
      (HOMA-IR) â‰¥1.8, body mass index between 28 and 40 kg/m2, aged 18-45 years, and who are&#xD;
      otherwise healthy, will be recruited. Interested individuals will have an initial medical&#xD;
      screening to confirm suitability. Those who are recruited will be asked to then complete a 7&#xD;
      days food diary before participating in the study. The whole study will last for a total of 6&#xD;
      weeks. During the first 2 weeks participants will adopt one of two meal patterns, followed by&#xD;
      a two-week washout period during which they resume their habitual diet and meal pattern. A&#xD;
      second 2-week intervention will then follow, in which the alternative meal pattern is&#xD;
      adopted. The meal patterns will be 1) regular - 6 daily meals or snacks for 2 weeks, or 2)&#xD;
      irregular - a different number (between 3 and 9) of meals/snacks every day. Allocation of the&#xD;
      order in which the diets are tested will be randomized at the point of recruitment with&#xD;
      participant number assigned sequentially. All foods to be consumed during weeks1, 2, 5 and 6&#xD;
      will be provided free of charge, and will comprise foods commonly consumed in the British&#xD;
      diet, in quantities designed to keep body weight constant during the study. Participants will&#xD;
      complete food diaries over the whole study period. They will be asked to wear a 'SenseWear'&#xD;
      armband (SWA) device (attached to an upper arm) to allow physical activity and energy&#xD;
      expenditure to be estimated during weeks1, 2, 5 and 6. Participants will attend the&#xD;
      laboratory on the 6th day of each intervention phase to have a continuous interstitial&#xD;
      glucose monitoring probe inserted in the subcutaneous abdominal fat pad at the level of the&#xD;
      umbilicus. Participants will measure their blood glucose four times a day, using a&#xD;
      fingerprick sample and pocket glucose analyser, to calibrate the continuous glucose monitor.&#xD;
      After three days participants will be asked to come back to have this device removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjective appetite (hunger, fullness, etc.) will be assessed using visual analogue scales&#xD;
      (VAS) during the intervention (at the end of each week, and whilst the glucose monitor is&#xD;
      being worn).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before and after each intervention period, participants will visit the laboratory after&#xD;
      fasting overnight. At 8:30 am a cannula will be inserted into a hand vein, with the hand&#xD;
      placed in a hot-air box, for subsequent blood sampling. Indirect calorimetry will be&#xD;
      performed to determine energy expenditure, carbohydrate and lipid oxidation rates and changes&#xD;
      in the thermic response to a milkshake test drink providing 10 kcals/kg body weight, and&#xD;
      comprising 35% of energy as fat, 15% as protein, and 50% as carbohydrate. The SWA device will&#xD;
      also be placed on the upper left arm to estimate energy expenditure during the laboratory&#xD;
      visit. Blood samples will be obtained before and every 15 minutes for 3 hours after eating.&#xD;
      Indirect calorimetry and SWA will be measured concurrently for the duration of the laboratory&#xD;
      visit. Fasting blood samples will be used to measure total-, high density lipoprotein (HDL)-,&#xD;
      LDL-, and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)-cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose and&#xD;
      insulin. Blood samples obtained after the test drink will also be used to measure glucose,&#xD;
      insulin and hormones related to appetite. After the 3hr postprandial period, a test meal&#xD;
      (pasta) will be provided as ad-libitum meal and participants will be asked to fill VAS to&#xD;
      assess subjective appetite sensations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurable end points of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  24hr Energy expenditure during the two phases (irregular versus regular meal pattern)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fasting lipids, insulin, glucose and glucose profiles during the continuous monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Insulin, glucose and gut hormone (Glucagon-Like Peptide 1, Ghrelin and Peptide YY)&#xD;
           responses to the test drink&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Postprandial thermogenic response to a test drink&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ratings of subjective appetite during the study Sample size and statistical power Using&#xD;
           1 sample t-test model, power calculated at the level of 0.8. Primary end point =&#xD;
           difference in thermic effect of food 'TEF' (kcal/min) over 180min. Results obtained from&#xD;
           study previous studies indicated the incremental area under the TEF curve after regular&#xD;
           eating was 25.8 (SD 6.8) kcal and after irregular eating was 14.8 (SD 11.7) kcal. With a&#xD;
           cross-over design, 10 subjects in each group would be able to detect a change in TEF&#xD;
           with the power of 80% at the level of 0.05 significance.&#xD;
