      The purpose of this study is to evaluate effects of Osteopathic Treatment in the Management&#xD;
      of Care-induced pain in Elderly care, in Follow-up care and Rehabilitation Geriatric.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators assume that the application of a procedure based on osteopathic fascial&#xD;
      techniques in elderly care in Suite and Geriatric Rehabilitation ( SSRG ) suffering from pain&#xD;
      of nursing care, could reduce the painful phenomenon having systemic action, and improve&#xD;
      tissue engineering, trophicity viscera and the neurovascular supply .&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The prevalence of pain in the elderly is very important, especially for people living in&#xD;
      institutions ( 40-70 % according to recent studies). Among the most common complaints include&#xD;
      pain induced by treatments. It is defined by Upsa Laboratory as pain of &quot;short duration&#xD;
      caused by the caregiver in the foreseeable occurrence of circumstances and can be prevented&#xD;
      by suitable measures .&quot; Responsible care are induced pain dressings, levies and other&#xD;
      diagnostics actions, mobilizations during an exchange , a toilet, a transfer between&#xD;
      different services or an act of rehabilitation. The repetition of acts and therefore the pain&#xD;
      , is also a source of anxiety for older people who often have to anticipate the following&#xD;
      treatments , and thus hinder the care relationship.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation of the induced pain is a growing concern for all caregivers. It concerns all&#xD;
      the players care, medical or paramedical.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prevention and relief of pain induced is part of regulatory obligations become since the Law&#xD;
      of 4 March 2002 on patients' rights and quality of the health system. It is in this dynamic,&#xD;
      in 2006 the Ministry of Health and Solidarity launched a support plan to improve the pain,&#xD;
      one of whose objectives was to promote the quality of life of older people reducing the&#xD;
      impact of pain on daily life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess pain in seniors several scales are listed and validated: ECPA scale that allows the&#xD;
      evaluation of recurrent pain induced pain and is used in some service of Suite and Geriatric&#xD;
      Rehabilitation (SSRG); Doloplus scale is more suitable for evaluation of chronic pain and&#xD;
      finally Algoplus scale specialized in the evaluation of acute pain. The pain assessment&#xD;
      difficulties in the elderly are also accentuated by the many possible etiologies, the&#xD;
      fatalistic attitude of some and the belief that pain is part of a normal aging process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is therefore to identify the intensity of the pain, its characteristics and causes to&#xD;
      guide treatment. The pain relief will be based on non-drug means (prevention, care&#xD;
      explanation, hypnosis, massage, cryotherapy), and / or medication when analgesia is no longer&#xD;
      sufficient. Drug treatment, however, have the disadvantage of frequent side effects and be&#xD;
      difficult to use in the elderly already poly medicated. Non-drug therapies, they can help&#xD;
      limit the requirements, and therefore their side effects, and as such are to be considered in&#xD;
      addition to usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Osteopathy is a holistic manual medicine that aims to prevent and remedy various functional&#xD;
      disorders of the body. This discipline has a wide scope whose positive influence was&#xD;
      demonstrated on particular musculoskeletal pain type of neck pain, back pain, visceral on as&#xD;
      chronic constipation, gastric reflux, migraines, or back pain chronic in the elderly in&#xD;
      institutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study's main objective is to determine through a randomized controlled clinical trial,&#xD;
      the efficacy of osteopathy on the reduction of pain induced in the elderly in institutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This type of study can have an impact on public health policy and help improve :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the treatment of pain induced in people SSRG ;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  propose a better use of medication and non-pharmacological methods like osteopathy ;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  assist in structuring the health care sector.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The public will be randomized using a block randomization, into two groups: a &quot;osteopathy&quot;&#xD;
      group and a &quot;simulated&quot; group (simulated techniques).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both procedures will not be provided by the same operator. Two exclusive osteopathic will&#xD;
      load groups &quot;osteopathy&quot; and &quot;simulated&quot; according to randomization to be set so as to ensure&#xD;
      a random distribution of the groups, that is to say, each operator will be as many patients&#xD;
      that simulated .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Service nurses will be in charge of data collection, blind, that is to say that they have&#xD;
      knowledge that the patient is included in the study but not the membership group. This&#xD;
      methodology will allow us as well to justify the contribution of osteopathy in relation to&#xD;
      the natural course of the patient's health status, and to justify the contribution of&#xD;
      osteopathy regardless of the operator. Operators will support different patients included in&#xD;
      the study in the same way, regardless of their allocation group. Thus, it will be applied a&#xD;
      standardized osteopathic and simulated procedure (described above) and the same attitude of&#xD;
      support from operators. Including verbal exchanges will be the same, addressing different&#xD;
      areas of the patient, whether medical, family, or professional. The goal is to ensure some&#xD;
      standardization in the management, which standardizes the simulated treatment and making it&#xD;
      look like at any point in the care osteopathic. For the sake of continuity of treatment, it&#xD;
      is &quot;osteopathic&quot; or &quot;simulated&quot; the operator assigned after randomization will perform the 3&#xD;
      sessions with the same patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Group &quot; osteopathy &quot;: an osteopathic fascial only procedure will be used , having no&#xD;
      technique called &quot; impulsive &quot; (or Thrust technique during which the patient may hear a&#xD;
      cracking sound ) . This approach therefore does not present any particular risk of side&#xD;
      effects for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically , the following techniques will be applied by the operator in order that wish&#xD;
      to: A technical on (or) scar (s)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Technical overall equilibration of the upper limbs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Technical overall equilibration of the lower limbs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A basic technique spread&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Technical C0 of equilibration relative to the sternum&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A technique of diaphragmatic equilibration&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A fascial technique on dorsal vertebrae and / or lumbar&#xD;
&#xD;
      At protocol performed for osteopathy group will be assigned to each area addressed by each&#xD;
      technique a coefficient of osteopathic dysfunction assessed in this way:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lack of dysfunction, coefficient 0&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  low Dysfunction, coefficient equal to 1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  moderate dysfunction, coefficient equal to 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  strong Dysfunction, coefficient equal to 3 These coefficients will be recorded in a&#xD;
           table at each meeting and will allow the operator to monitor the patient own&#xD;
           dysfunctional pattern.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group &quot; simulated &quot;: The simulated protocol similar to that used in the study of John C.&#xD;
           Licciardone et al. and validated by North Texas Chronic Low Back Pain Trial , is&#xD;
           performed in the same positions as the care osteopathic . The operator places his hands&#xD;
           on the same areas , avoiding associated mobilize joints and muscles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both procedures &quot; osteopathic &quot; and &quot;simulated&quot; , will be provided in three sessions lasting&#xD;
      60 minutes each, one week apart . The interval of one week is justified by the fact that the&#xD;
      nursing care can be repeated several times a day , and the constraints of prolonged bed rest&#xD;
      being permanent , the tissues of patients are found in an advanced state of fibrosis . It&#xD;
      then seems necessary to allow an integration time between sessions. The choice of 3 sessions&#xD;
      is based on a compromise between feasibility in the service, acceptability for the patient&#xD;
      and the investigators' assessment of the optimal intensity of the procedure. Week 4 , only a&#xD;
      data collection will be realized.&#xD;
