  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain is one of the major symptoms in palliative care units and often is very difficult to&#xD;
      treat, being considered as a refractory pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are different causes of refractory pain: pain due to bed sores and ulcer bandages,&#xD;
      carcinological or ischemic wounds or injuries, pain due to patients' reduced mobility, pain&#xD;
      due to traumatological injuries, pain associated with a long-term bed confinement, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a prospective study to estimate the effect and the tolerance to a&#xD;
      subcutaneous bolus of ketamine administered for the treatment of refractory pain due to the&#xD;
      care of bedsores, ulcers and vascular wounds in patients hospitalized in palliative care&#xD;
      units.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients in palliative care units have serious and incurable conditions and are in the&#xD;
      sickness' late or final stages. This is why the relief of their symptoms is a priority for&#xD;
      their medical care, being pain one of the major symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, the idea of treating various types of pain such as pain due to bed sore and&#xD;
      ulcer bandages, carcinological or ischemic wounds or injuries, pain due to patients' reduced&#xD;
      mobility, etc. was raised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      French Ministry of Health's 2010 recommends the use of ketamine to treat refractory pain&#xD;
      after the failure of usual therapeutic treatments (opioids, Nitrous oxide and oxygen (also&#xD;
      known as MEOPA)). This treatment is then used in association with midazolam (0.01 to 0.05&#xD;
      mg/kg) to prevent hallucinating effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the intravenous treatment is often the alternative and this choice is justified by&#xD;
      the study population's characteristics (usually elderly patients, multi-pathologic, etc) and&#xD;
      by the invasive way of treatment used with a repeated central and peripheral venous catheters&#xD;
      which is contrary to the primary objective of patient comfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the investigators' knowledge, no randomised study has ever been done regarding the use of&#xD;
      ketamine to treat refractory pain administered subcutaneously.&#xD;
