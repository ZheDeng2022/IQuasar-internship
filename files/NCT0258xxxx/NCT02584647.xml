  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if treatment with PLX3397 and Sirolimus will be&#xD;
      tolerated and result in shrinking of the cancer or stopping the cancer from growing. In the&#xD;
      phase I portion, the maximum tolerate dose of the study drug will be determined. In the Phase&#xD;
      II portion, progression free survival will be assessed at the dose level found in Phase I.&#xD;
      Participants will continue to take the study drug until they experience an unacceptable side&#xD;
      effect or their disease progresses. Funding Source - FDA OOPD&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) represent up to 10% of adult soft tissue&#xD;
      sarcomas. Due to its rarity, few MPNST-specific prospective trials exist, and treatments are&#xD;
      largely based on extrapolation from results from other sarcoma subtypes. Since the molecular&#xD;
      pathways driving pathogenesis within sarcoma subtypes are distinct, these treatment options&#xD;
      are likely suboptimal at best. Targeted therapies that block key pathways known to drive&#xD;
      MPNST will likely result in superior tumor responses with limited toxicities.&#xD;

    <description>Sirolimus is a macrocyclic lactone that binds to tacrolimus (FK506) binding protein 12 and inhibits mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) resulting in cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis.&#xD;
Sirolimus is currently approved as an immunosuppressive agent for organ transplantation and more recently, as a component of cardiac arterial stents because of its potent antiproliferative effects on fibroblasts responsible for restenosis after such a procedure (26) Sirolimus is commonly administered orally on a daily basis, in doses ranging from 2 to 40 mg/day.</description>

             agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control;&#xD;
             abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a&#xD;
             woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is&#xD;
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men&#xD;
             treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;
             prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 3 months after&#xD;
             completion of PLX3397 and sirolimus administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Fertile men must agree to use an effective method of birth control during the study&#xD;

             procedures and to comply with all study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Agree to pre and post-treatment tumor biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior treatment-related Adverse Events must be ≤ grade 1 (CTCAE v4.0), except&#xD;
             alopecia, at time of initiating study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for&#xD;
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not&#xD;
             recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier or&#xD;
             within 14 days from cycle 1 day 1 of PLX3397 and sirolimus.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents concurrently.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concomitant treatment with other anti-neoplastic agents (hormonal therapy acceptable).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with symptomatic brain metastases. Subjects with untreated brain metastasis ≤&#xD;
             1 cm can be considered eligible if deemed asymptomatic by the investigator upon&#xD;
             consultation with the medical monitor and do not require immediate radiation or&#xD;
             steroids. Subjects with brain metastasis that is treated and stable for 1 month may be&#xD;
             considered eligible if they are asymptomatic and on stable dose of steroids or if they&#xD;
             do not require steroids following successful local therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to PLX3397 or sirolimus.&#xD;

             Rapamycin inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because PLX3397 and sirolimus are agents&#xD;
             with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an&#xD;
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with PLX3397 and sirolimus, breastfeeding should be&#xD;
             discontinued if the mother is treated with PLX3397 and sirolimus.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, active liver disease, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina&#xD;
             pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would&#xD;
             limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active secondary malignancy unless the malignancy is not expected to interfere with&#xD;
             the evaluation of safety and is approved by the Sponsor. Examples of the latter&#xD;
             include basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, in-situ carcinoma of the cervix,&#xD;
             and isolated elevation of prostate-specific antigen. Subjects with a completely&#xD;
             treated prior malignancy and no evidence of disease for ≥ 2 years are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major surgical procedure or significant traumatic injury within 14 days of initiating&#xD;
             study drug or anticipation of the need for major surgery during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous radiotherapy to 25% or more of the bone marrow and/or radiation therapy&#xD;
             within 28 days prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to swallow capsules, or refractory nausea and vomiting, malabsorption, an&#xD;
             external biliary shunt, or significant bowel resection that would preclude adequate&#xD;
             absorption.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Congestive heart failure (CHF) New York (NY) Heart Association class III or IV;&#xD;
             unstable coronary artery disease (myocardial infarction (MI) more than 6 months prior&#xD;
             to study entry is permitted); or serious cardiac arrhythmia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Baseline QTc corrected by Fridericia's formula (QTcF) ≥ 450 ms (males) or ≥ 470 ms&#xD;
             (females)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of&#xD;
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with PLX3397. In addition, these&#xD;
             patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow&#xD;
             suppressive therapy. Similarly, patients with chronic or acute hepatitis C virus (HCV)&#xD;
             or hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection are also ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Of the five major cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms, 3A4 (BFC) may be involved in Phase I&#xD;
             metabolism of PLX3397, with possibly CYP1A2 playing a minor role. Until information&#xD;
             regarding exposure toxicity and exposure-response relationships are available with&#xD;
             PLX3397, concomitant strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers are not permitted in the&#xD;
             event they alter the systemic exposure to PLX3397 (see Attachment 1 for a list of&#xD;
             common CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers). These include anticonvulsants, mycin&#xD;
             antimicrobials, and antiretrovirals. Some common examples include inhibitors such as&#xD;
             erythromycin, fluoxetine, gemfibrozil, and inducers such as rifampicin, carbamazepine,&#xD;
             phenytoin, efavirenz, and nevirapine. Concomitant treatment is permitted if the&#xD;
             medication is not expected to interfere with the evaluation of safety or efficacy of&#xD;
             the study drug. Sirolimus undergoes extensive hepatic and intestinal metabolism via&#xD;
             CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, as well as excretion by P-glycoprotein. Strong CYP3A inhibitors&#xD;
             such as ketoconazole or grapefruit juice are not permitted. Patients should be&#xD;
             monitored for supratherapeutic toxic levels of sirolimus and PLX3397. As bone marrow&#xD;
             suppression including anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia have been reported in&#xD;
             patients receiving sirolimus monotherapy, these adverse effects may be exacerbated in&#xD;
             combination with PLX3397 for which patients will be closely monitored.&#xD;
