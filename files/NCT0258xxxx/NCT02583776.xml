    <textblock>
      Neonatal hypoglycemia is associated with brain injury and impaired neurodevelopment outcomes&#xD;
      in very low birth weight infants (VLBWI). Glycemic monitoring is usually performed by&#xD;
      capillary or central line sampling but does not identify up to 81% of hypoglycemic episodes&#xD;
      in preterm newborns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to assess if a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) can be used to maintain&#xD;
      euglycemia (defined as a target value 72-144mg/dl) in VLBWI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will be enrolled newborns ≤32 weeks gestational age and/or of birthweight ≤1500 g, within&#xD;
      48 hours of life, they will be randomized in two study arms, both them will wear Dexcom G4&#xD;
      Platinum CGM: 1) Unblinded group (UB): glucose daily intake will be modulated according to&#xD;
      CGM (Dexcom G4 Platinum) during the first 7 days of life, alarms for hypos/hyper will be&#xD;
      active; 2) Blinded group (B), glucose infusion rate will be modified according to 2-3 daily&#xD;
      capillary glucose tests, alarms for hypos will be switched off. Pain at insertion will be&#xD;
      evaluated with the validated Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP) scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The estimated numerosity is 50 patients (25 for each arm).&#xD;

      Background - Neonatal hypoglycemia is a common event during the first week of life and has&#xD;
      been associated to brain injuries and poor neurodevelopment. Unfortunately it may be&#xD;
      unrecognized for several hours from its occurrence, since it is asymptomatic/poor symptomatic&#xD;
      in newborns (Hay WW, 2009; Cornblath, 2000; Adamkin DH, 2011; Burns et al, 2008; Wong, 2013;&#xD;
      Duvanel et al, 1999) Despite the dramatic consequences of prolonged hypoglycemia on the&#xD;
      neonatal brain are well known, the only tool to recognize it is represented by the capillary&#xD;
      glycemic test performed according to risk-based protocols of Neonatal Intensive Care Units&#xD;
      (NICUs): they consider a limited window of intervention based on 2-3 glycemic tests a day&#xD;
      (Thomas F et al, J. Diab Science Technol. 2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous glucose monitoring systems have offered, in the last decade, a new powerful tool&#xD;
      to recognize more hypoglycemic events in neonates than traditional monitoring. All the works&#xD;
      developed in neonates, to date, have been aimed to evaluate the performance of the CGM&#xD;
      devices and have been used to record the effect of medical &quot;intervention&quot; in the correction&#xD;
      of hypo or hyperglycemia (Neonatal Insulin Replacement Therapy in Europe (NIRTURE, Beardsall&#xD;
      et al, NEJM 2008; McKinlay et al, NEJM 2015) (Harris et al J Pediatrics, 2010; Beardsall et&#xD;
      al, Arch Dis Child Fetal Neonatal 2013). The CGM has never been used to drive medical&#xD;
      inteventions in newborns and evaluate as independent tool to improve time-in-target for&#xD;
      glycemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies demonstrated that up to 81% of the hypoglycemic episodes were not detected&#xD;
      with blood glucose measurement (Harris et al, J Pediatrics 2010). All the published studies&#xD;
      in neonates, to date, have used Medtronic CGM systems (Medtronic, USA). No adverse effects,&#xD;
      associated to the implant of CGM, have been reported neither in late-preterm neither in&#xD;
      preterm newborns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glycemic control in terms, and moreover, in preterm newborns still represent a challenge for&#xD;
      physicians and the wide fluctuation (both hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia) commonly observed&#xD;
      in such population still remains difficult to be managed with traditional blood glucose&#xD;
      monitoring (few data/day, delay of therapeutic intervention).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim - The study the Investigators are going to conduct is aimed to evaluate if CGM, as driver&#xD;
      of therapeutic decisions in preterm newborns (birthweight ≤1500g, gestational age ≤32 weeks)&#xD;
      during the first week of life, may be able to maintain &quot;euglycemia&quot;. Euglycemia will be&#xD;
      defined as values within the range 72-144mg/dl (4-8mmol/L)(Harris et al J Pediatrics, 2010;&#xD;
      Beardsall et al, Arch Dis Child Fetal Neonatal Ed 2013)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design - Randomized Controlled Trial&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients: newborns with GA ≤32weeks and/or BW≤ 1500 g. They will be enrolled within the&#xD;
           first 48 hours of life&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intevention group: Unblinded CGM (DexcomG4Platinum) data to adequate daily glucose&#xD;
           intake&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control group: Blinded CGM with daily glucose intake adequated according to SMBG (=2&#xD;
           blood glucose/day)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary Outcome: to evaluate if Unblinded CGM increases the time within &quot;euglycemic&quot;&#xD;
           range (72-144mg/dl)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods - Dexcom G4 Platinum (Dexcom Inc, CA - USA) sensor will be applied&#xD;
      within 48 hours from birth to the study population on the lateral side of thigh, after&#xD;
      parents' consent collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the patients will be randomized to the blinded or unblinded group before the application&#xD;
      of CGM. Randomization will be performed using a randomization list electronically generated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unblinded group (intervention/open CGM group): they will wear CGM for 7 days, the alarms of&#xD;
      CGM will be switched on and the daily intake of carbohydrates will be adapted according to&#xD;
      CGM data. The study staff will record data every three hours in absence of hypo alarms (see&#xD;
      below for carbs adjustment procedure).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinded group: they will wear CGM for 7 days, the alarms and the CGM monitor will be blinded.&#xD;
      At least two calibrations a day, according to manufacturer instruction, will be inserted. The&#xD;
      daily amount of carbohydrates will be decided according to blood glucose test (at least&#xD;
      2/day) and to recommendation of American Academy of Pediatrics (see below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numerosity: the estimated numerosity is 50 patients according to primary outcome.&#xD;
      Unfortunately no data are available on this population; 10 extra patients will be recruited&#xD;
      in case of premature interruption of recording (due to sensor detachment, malfunction, loss&#xD;
      of the patient or interruption of monitoring due to local/systemic complication) in order to&#xD;
      ensure a total amount of 250 days of monitoring (50% in the UB-CGM group and 50% in the B-CGM&#xD;
      group) with a maximum amount of 350 days of monitoring. So the estimated time of monitoring&#xD;
      is expected to be min 250, max 350 days, divided into the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reasons for study interruption: local and/or systemic complication due to the application of&#xD;
      device, transfer of patient to another center of care, withdrawal of consent, death,&#xD;
      malfunction of device. Reasons for interruption of monitoring will be specified in the final&#xD;
      report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carbohydrates adjustment procedure: the procedure for carbohydrates adjustment uses a&#xD;
      worksheet described in Agus MSD, Steil G et al NEJM 2012 and adapted to NICU standard of&#xD;
      nutrition suggested from American Academy of Pediatrics. The worksheet has been set up&#xD;
      according to the NICU protocols in agreement with recommendation of American Academy of&#xD;
      Pediatrics, Committee on Nutrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 1st day intake is set on 6-8gr/kg of carbohydrates; a default daily increase of&#xD;
      1gr/kg/day in case of euglycemia is applied; such increase may variate according to the CGM&#xD;
      data in the unblinded group or to the 2 glycemic tests performed in the blinded group in&#xD;
      order to achieve the target as following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. if the average was &gt;= 180 mg/dL decrease the calculated GIR by 1 g/kg/d ii. If the average&#xD;
      was between 144 and 179 mg/dL do not make any adjustment iii. If the average was between 72&#xD;
      and 143 mg/dL check if the minimum GIR has been reached and if not increase the value to the&#xD;
      minimum GIR for that day iv. If the average was lower than 72 mg/dL increase the rate to the&#xD;
      either the minimum rate + 2 or the calculated rate plus 2, whichever is bigger; v. if&#xD;
      glycemia &lt;41mg/gl: increase of 2.8g/kg/die the GIR and perform a bolus of 2ml/kg/d of G10%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Details of the worksheet have been described in Agus et al (NEJM2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Worksheet has been designed considering as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target 108,00 Low limit 72,00 High limit 144,00 Hyper Theshold 180,00 Hypo Threshold 40,00 A&#xD;
      decrease has been considered above hyper threshold of 1g/kg/d up to a minimum GIR of&#xD;
      4.5g/k/d. No increase will be performed between 144 and 180mg/dl.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis will be performed as intention to treat (ITT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion: perspective and limits - Euglycemia definition remains controversial in&#xD;
      neonatology. Even though, in our study, we have decided to adopt the NIRTURE targets&#xD;
      (Beardsall et al, 2010) considering optimal a range from 72 mg/dl (4 mmol/L) to 144mg/dl (8&#xD;
      mmol/L). Values below 40mg/dl will require a G10% bolus (2ml/kg) and an increase of 2.8gr/kg&#xD;
      of intake of carbs; values between 40 and 77mg/dl require an increase of carbs adapted to&#xD;
      reach the middle point of the expected target. Similarly for values above the upper limit we&#xD;
      have considered a decrease of carbs intake (minimum 4.5gr/kg/day).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main difference between the two study groups is represented by the number of information&#xD;
      available for the physician and, consequently, from the number of changes in glucose intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of a worksheet will allow the investigators to avoid inter-individuals variability in&#xD;
      making infusion changes standardizing the interventions in two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Actually the traditional system of monitoring of glycemia has been demonstrated to be unable&#xD;
      to detect a significant number of glycemic variations during the daytime. Increasing the&#xD;
      number of blood glycemic test (by heel prick) would mean to increase the number of painful&#xD;
      procedures for the newborn with an uncertain benefit and the workload of the staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disclosures: Dexcom Inc, USA will provide materials for the study as donation to the Neonatal&#xD;
      Intensive Care Unit of University Hospital of Padua, Italy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has been designed as a no-profit research project by the Principal Investigators&#xD;
      and Collaborators of Neonatal Intensive Care Unit of University of Padua, Department of&#xD;
      Bioengineering (University of Padua) and Boston Children's Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dexcom Inc has not been involved in the study design and will not be involved in results&#xD;
      evaluation.&#xD;
