      Obesity represents one of the most important public health challenges for the societies.&#xD;
      Although excess energy intake and physical inactivity are major causes of obesity and&#xD;
      cardiometabolic disorders, emerging evidence has linked persistent organic pollutants (POPs)&#xD;
      with the global epidemic of type 2 diabetes. However, the potential impacts of POPs on&#xD;
      obesity and cardiometabolic risk in humans remain poorly known. On the other side systematic&#xD;
      reviews and meta-analyses conducted in recent years strongly support a protective association&#xD;
      between eating nuts and CVD. The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled clinical&#xD;
      trial in adults. The main research questions are: a. Does consumption of fatty fish increase&#xD;
      levels of POPs in overweight and obese adult norwegian men and women compared to a control&#xD;
      group not consuming fatty fish? b. Does consumption of fatty fish affect markers of&#xD;
      cardiometabolic risks (blood pressure, lipids, glucose and CRP) in overweight and obese adult&#xD;
      norwegian men and women compared to a control group not consuming fatty fish? c. Does&#xD;
      consumption of nuts improve markers of cardiometabolic risks in overweight and obese adult&#xD;
      Norwegian men and women compared:1. to a control group not consuming nuts or fatty fish and&#xD;
      2. to a group consuming fatty fish.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical significance of study: If an increase in POP levels is seen, and correlates with&#xD;
      cardiometabolic risks, this may indicate the need to look further at a causal relation&#xD;
      between POPs and cardiometabolic disease and risk factors particularly type 2 diabetes. If&#xD;
      eating nuts improves CVD risk factors compared to not eating nuts, or to eating fatty fish,&#xD;
      this could be important dietary information for populations at high risk of CVD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Today more than one-fifth of the adult Norwegian population is obese, and the prevalence of&#xD;
      abdominal obesity has increased disproportionately in women. Cardiometabolic disorders&#xD;
      (metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes) follow in the wake of obesity increasing health burdens&#xD;
      on the population. Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are lipophilic chemicals like&#xD;
      dioxins, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and organochlorine pesticides (OPs) that&#xD;
      bioaccumulate in living organisms for many years. In humans POPs are mainly stored in adipose&#xD;
      tissue, and these chemicals have been detected in plasma of all populations, including&#xD;
      babies. Humans are mainly exposed to POPs through the consumption of fatty rich food, with&#xD;
      the highest levels of POPs being present in fatty fish. Because of the presence of&#xD;
      polyunsaturated n-3 fatty acids, eating fatty fish has been generally associated with good&#xD;
      health outcomes. However, questions have arisen whether POPs and other pollutants are&#xD;
      impairing the nutritional benefits of fish (5). Dietary modification is a major cornerstone&#xD;
      of prevention and treatment of obesity and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Evidence has linked&#xD;
      the Mediterranean diet to prevention of CVD and sustained weight loss. The Mediterranean diet&#xD;
      as consumed traditionally consists of bread, legumes, vegetables and fruits, nuts, olive oil,&#xD;
      and limited red meats, meat products, butter, hard margarine and sugar as well as moderate&#xD;
      alcohol intake. Acceptance and feasibility of the Mediterranean diet is limited in&#xD;
      non-Mediterranean countries and in certain groups and requires modification according to&#xD;
      local culture and norms. In Norway, official dietary recommendations advise that the&#xD;
      population should eat lots of vegetables, fruit, berries, whole grains, legumes, nuts and&#xD;
      fish and that processed and red meats, salt and sugar should be limited (11). Nuts are a&#xD;
      powerhouse of protein, fiber, unsaturated fatty acids including n-3 fatty acids and&#xD;
      phytochemicals, and are easy to incorporate into the diet. Evidence links nuts to reduced&#xD;
      rates of CVD and overweight. Dietary recommendations most likely to reduce CVD risk in&#xD;
      patients with overweight or obesity are controversial. If eating fatty fish regularly worsens&#xD;
      metabolic regulation, an alternative to fatty fish may be eating nuts. This study aims to&#xD;
      clarify the effects of eating fatty fish compared to nuts on cardiovascular risk factors and&#xD;
      levels of POPs in patients with overweight or obesity who are at risk of CVD. 2.0 Insulin&#xD;
      resistance is tightly related to abdominal obesity and is accompanied by a host of changes in&#xD;
      cardiometabolic risk factors including low HDL cholesterol, high triglycerides, and&#xD;
      subclinical inflammation (shown as high CRP), disturbances that lead to CVD. Other&#xD;
      characteristics include high levels of adipokines (leptin, visfatin) and decreased&#xD;
      adiponectin, an insulin-sensitizing hormone. Clinically the presence of three or more of five&#xD;
      risk factors, namely abdominal obesity, low HDL cholesterol, high triglycerides, high fasting&#xD;
      glucose, and high blood pressure, characterizes metabolic syndrome. Insulin resistance can be&#xD;
      measured most precisely by the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp method, but this method is&#xD;
      time consuming and can only be applied to limited samples. Clinically, insulin resistance is&#xD;
      suggested by high C-peptide. The Homeostasis Model Assessment index can be calculated to&#xD;
      estimate insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) using fasting glucose and insulin levels. 3.1 Obesity&#xD;
      and POPs Factors affecting the homeostasis between POPs stored in adipose tissue and&#xD;
      circulating blood concentrations are not clear. Both higher and lower POP levels have been&#xD;
      reported in obese versus lean individuals. These associations may differ according to the&#xD;
      compound and previous exposure. Less chlorinated PCBs, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE)&#xD;
      and dioxin showed adjusted odds ratio of 2-3 for abdominal obesity in data from seniors.&#xD;
      Because studies are mostly cross-sectional, or obtained data on weight change&#xD;
      retrospectively, causation between POP levels and obesity remains speculative. Weight loss&#xD;
      reduces adipose tissue storage increasing concentrations in blood in the short term, though&#xD;
      drastic weight loss decreases the total body burden. 3.3 Farmed fish as a source of POPs -&#xD;
      studies from Norway A much cited study published in 2004 found that farmed salmon had&#xD;
      significantly higher POP burdens than wild salmon and that farmed salmon from Europe were&#xD;
      significantly more contaminated than farmed salmon from South and North America. Since that&#xD;
      time, levels of some POPs like dioxins are likely to have decreased, as current aquaculture&#xD;
      feed increasingly is based on plant oils. However, other contaminants like OPs and polycyclic&#xD;
      aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), which are omnipresent in vegetable oils, are largely present in&#xD;
      farmed fish. Recently, significant amounts of POPs were reported to remain in Norwegian&#xD;
      salmon. Importantly, proportions of n-3 fatty acids have decreased by about 50%. High levels&#xD;
      of POPs have been shown in coastal Norwegian populations, as well as associations between&#xD;
      marine food consumption and concentrations of POPs (26, 27). Further studies have shown that&#xD;
      oily fish is the main source of PCBs and dioxins in both high and population-representative&#xD;
      fish consumers in Norway. Clear correlations were shown between estimated intakes and blood&#xD;
      concentrations of POPs. 4.1 Nuts and CVD Systematic reviews and meta-analyses conducted in&#xD;
      recent years strongly support a protective association between eating nuts and CVD. Three&#xD;
      meta-analyses appeared in 2014. Studies found that nut intake was inversely associated with&#xD;
      ischemic heart disease, overall CVD and all-cause mortality but not significantly associated&#xD;
      with diabetes and stroke. There was found an inverse association between eating nuts and&#xD;
      incident ischemic heart disease and diabetes but not with stroke. It has been found a linear&#xD;
      dose-response relationship between nut consumption and coronary artery disease (CAD) risk,&#xD;
      where the risk of CAD decreased by 5% for every serving/week. Randomized dietary trial&#xD;
      provided experimental evidence to support the protective effect of nuts on CVD. Participants&#xD;
      aged 55 to 80 years and at high risk of CVD were randomly assigned to one of three dietary&#xD;
      interventions: Mediterranean diet supplemented with virgin olive oil or nuts (approximately&#xD;
      30 g/day of mixed nuts), or a low-fat diet. The primary end point was the rate of major&#xD;
      cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes)&#xD;
      and median follow-up was 4.8 years. The multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio for the group&#xD;
      assigned to a Mediterranean diet with nuts was 0.72 versus the control group. 4.2 Nuts and&#xD;
      body weight Though nuts are an energy dense food, eating nuts does not appear to be&#xD;
      associated with increased body weight. Meta-analysis conducted in 2013 found 33 relevant&#xD;
      clinical trials of nut intake that provided outcomes of body weight. Compared with control&#xD;
      diets, diets enriched with nuts did not increase body weight, BMI or waist circumference. The&#xD;
      effects of nuts on energy have been summarized lately. Nuts are characterized as having high&#xD;
      satiety value leading to strong compensatory dietary responses, inefficiency in absorption of&#xD;
      the energy they contain and augmentation of fat oxidation. 4.3 Nuts and cardiometabolic risk&#xD;
      factors A number of mechanisms have been examined in experimental studies providing putative&#xD;
      explanations of the protective effects of nuts on CVD. Effects have been shown primarily with&#xD;
      walnuts, hazelnuts, almonds and pistachios. Eating walnuts was shown to improved endothelial&#xD;
      function in overweight adults with visceral obesity. Mediterranean diets supplemented with&#xD;
      olive oil or nuts reduced 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure, total cholesterol and fasting&#xD;
      glucose and reversed metabolic syndrome and shifted lipoprotein subfractions to a less&#xD;
      atherogenic pattern. Diets enriched with hazelnuts improved endothelial function, prevented&#xD;
      LDL oxidation and lowered inflammatory markers in addition to lipid-lowering effects. Nuts&#xD;
      could be an alternative to fatty fish in the diet, both for persons wishing to eat vegetarian&#xD;
      diets, for those wishing to avoid contaminants, and for improving CVD risk factors in persons&#xD;
      at high risk. However, we are unaware of studies that have compared CVD risk factors in diets&#xD;
      including nuts versus fatty fish.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.0 Objectives of the study and main hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to a control group not consuming nuts or fatty fish&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to a group consuming fatty fish&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The investigators hypothesize that consumption of fatty fish will increase levels of&#xD;
           POPs in overweight and obese norwegian men and women.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The investigators hypothesize that the consumption of fatty fish will change markers of&#xD;
           cardiometabolic risk in overweight and obese norwegian men and women.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The investigators hypothesize that the consumption of nuts will improve markers of&#xD;
           cardiometabolic risks in overweight and obese norwegian men and women both compared to a&#xD;
           control group not consuming nuts and to the group consuming fatty fish. Variables,&#xD;
           follow-up and endpoints: Clinic visits will be scheduled at biweekly intervals during&#xD;
           the first 12 weeks to ensure stability of body weight in both groups and compliance.&#xD;
           Vital signs and weight will be measured at visits in a standardized manner. A subsample&#xD;
           of 15 participants in each of the fish, nut and control groups will undergo a&#xD;
           hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp for evaluation of insulin sensitivity and resistance&#xD;
           at baseline and after three months. For POPs analyses samples will be frozen at -70&#xD;
           degrees Celsius and analyzed batchwise for the following 21 POPs, which are suspected to&#xD;
           strongly act as endocrine and metabolic disruptors:14 PCBs, including dioxin-like PCBs&#xD;
           and non-dioxin-like PCBs, 5, 2,2',4,4'-tetra-bromobiphenyl ether and 1 dioxin. Power:&#xD;
           Similar studies to the current one have not been performed previously to help in&#xD;
           calculation of sample size, however, this is attempted. In a six-month period a possibly&#xD;
           clinically relevant change in POPs may be a 15-20% increase - this is also the&#xD;
           difference in PCBs between representative and high consumers in Norway (29). The study&#xD;
           will include 40 participants in each group to allow for dropouts for a total of 120&#xD;
           participants. Clinical significance of study: If an increase in POP levels is seen, and&#xD;
           correlates with cardiometabolic risks, this may indicate the need to look further at a&#xD;
           causal relation between POPs and cardiometabolic disease and risk factors particularly&#xD;
           type 2 diabetes. If eating fatty fish promotes cardiometabolic risk, this may indicate&#xD;
           the need to reevaluate current dietary recommendations. If eating nuts improves CVD risk&#xD;
           factors compared to not eating nuts, or to eating fatty fish, this could be important&#xD;
           dietary information for populations at high risk of CVD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.3 Statistical analyses The statistical analysis will follow intent-to-treat principle, with&#xD;
      additional complementary analyses of the per protocol population. Data analysis for changes&#xD;
      in POPs and CVD risk factors will comprise all randomized individuals who complete the&#xD;
      12-week first study phase (intention to treat analysis - primary outcome). This analysis will&#xD;
      be repeated including only per protocol participants who recorded over 80% compliance with&#xD;
      assigned foods (completer analysis - secondary outcome). Between group comparisons of changes&#xD;
      in POPs and CVD risk factors will be performed using the independent samples t-test. The&#xD;
      study will compare the fish group to controls, and to the nut group. Within-group comparisons&#xD;
      will be performed using the paired t-test. P-values &lt;0.05 will be considered statistically&#xD;
      significant.&#xD;
