    <textblock>
      This is a doble-blind, masked, compared with placebo clinical trial in pediatric population&#xD;
      in contact with tuberculosis with or without tuberculosis infection. This trial aims to study&#xD;
      the effect of the probiotic Nyaditum resae® at the level of specific Treg memory cells eight&#xD;
      weeks after the first administration, and the global tolerability of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nyaditum resae® is a preparation in the form of capsules containing heat-killed environmental&#xD;
      mycobacteria Mycobacterium manresensis. The overall objective of the study is the effect of&#xD;
      Nyaditum resae® on immunity, which could reduce the risk of developing active tuberculosis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of tuberculosis is still a problem of the first magnitude. Every year 1.5&#xD;
      million people die; there are 10 million cases of illness and 100 million new infected. The&#xD;
      growing problem of multi-resistance is to be added, remaining so prevalent: 700,000 patients,&#xD;
      a figure that increases annually with 100,000 people. Prevention of tuberculosis is currently&#xD;
      very difficult because it is a disease caused by a bacillus (Mycobacterium tuberculosis) that&#xD;
      is transmitted by air: No risk factor for becoming infected has been identified and there is&#xD;
      still no prophylactic vaccine that prevents from infection. One of the most characteristic&#xD;
      aspects of tuberculosis is that the majority (90-95 %) of people without immunity alterations&#xD;
      do not develop the disease after being infected. As for people who do develop the disease, it&#xD;
      is still not known why they develop it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A group of researchers from the Institut Germans Trias i Pujol recently discovered a&#xD;
      mechanism that explains this trend. In short, what happens is that certain people create a&#xD;
      too strong inflammatory response against tuberculosis bacillus, which ends up creating&#xD;
      massive destruction of the tissue that is around the bacillus and brings the characteristic&#xD;
      lesion of tuberculosis: tuberculous cavity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This group of researchers was devising ways to &quot;reeducate&quot; the immune system against the&#xD;
      bacillus not make it aggressive. And they did it using two instruments. The first one, an&#xD;
      environmental mycobacteria, namely a bacillus of the family of mycobacteria tuberculosis,&#xD;
      that usually lives in the water we drink, so that at a greater or lesser extent we already&#xD;
      have it in our intestinal flora. The second, inducing a tolerant response, like we do when we&#xD;
      eat food. To induce a tolerant response, low and repeated doses of the product make the&#xD;
      immune system of the digestive duct &quot;used to&quot; their presence. Thus, when it becomes to find&#xD;
      the product, the immune system reacts in a very light and balanced manner, avoiding excessive&#xD;
      inflammatory responses. The clearest example is the fact that our immune system &quot;is used&quot; to&#xD;
      feed proteins and generates no rejection answers found in the intestinal mucosa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence comes the probiotic Nyaditum resae®, a preparation in the form of capsules, containing&#xD;
      a heat-killed Mycobacterium manresensis and thus can generate a cross-immunity with the&#xD;
      tuberculosis bacillus. By giving low and repeated dose to generate a tolerant response, which&#xD;
      happens when there is an infection by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, so that a balanced immune&#xD;
      response is triggered able to reduce the risk of developing active tuberculosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tolerability of Nyaditum resae® has been studied in adults. Next step is to asses its&#xD;
      behavior in pediatric population, since is a particularly vulnerable population in countries&#xD;
      where there is a high incidence of this disease.&#xD;
