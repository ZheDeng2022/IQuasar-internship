  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I study to evaluate the safety of ALLO-ASC-CD for the treatment of crohn'&#xD;
      disease. ALLO-ASC-CD is intravenous infusion containing allogenic adipose-derived mesenchymal&#xD;
      stem cells.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adipose-derived stem cells are directed to injured tissue, and reduce inflammation.&#xD;
      Furthermore, their immunomodulatory effects are significant for treating immune-related&#xD;
      diseases, such as crohn's disease. Finally, ALLO-ASC-CD may provide a new option in treating&#xD;
      a crohn's disease.&#xD;
