  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, single-center, open-label trial of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in subjects&#xD;
      with advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who have progressed&#xD;
      after failure of any combination chemotherapy containing a platinum and a fluoropyrimidine&#xD;
      agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 60 subjects will be enrollment to evaluate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment will begin with all subjects without regard for PD-L1 expression status. An&#xD;
      evaluable specimen for PD-L1 status must be available and confirmed prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study subjects will be evaluated every 6 weeks (+/- 7 days) following the date of IP drug&#xD;
      adminstration for the first six months and every 12 weeks (+/- 7 days) thereafter until&#xD;
      progression of disease is documented with radiologic imaging (computed tomography or magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the expansion cohort (cohort B), it was expanded on the original cohort based on response&#xD;
      analysis and will be opened separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of the 5 MSI-high patients who were enrolled on to original cohort, all 5 MSI high GC&#xD;
      patients (100% response rate) demonstrated dramatic response rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on this finding, in order to proven Pembrolizumab's efficacy to specific MSI-H GC&#xD;
      population, we would like enroll 20 more patients in cohort B. Based on our screening&#xD;
      protocol, the prevalence of MSI-high in GC is about 15 %. Only MSI-high GC patients will be&#xD;
      included. All the eligibility will be the same.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each subject will participate in the trial from the time the subject signs the Informed&#xD;
      Consent Form (ICF) through the final contact. After a screening phase of up to 28 days,&#xD;
      eligible subjects will receive treatment beginning on Day 1 of each 3-week dosing cycle for&#xD;
      pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment with pembrolizumab or paclitaxel will continue until documented disease&#xD;
      progression, unacceptable adverse event(s), undercurrent illness that prevents further&#xD;
      administration of treatment, Investigator's decision to withdraw the subject, subject&#xD;
      withdraw consent, pregnancy of the subject, noncompliance with trial treatment o procedure&#xD;
      requirements, subject receives 24 months of pembrolizumab, or administrative reasons&#xD;
      requiring cessation of treatment. After the end of treatment, each subject will be followed&#xD;
      for 30 days for adverse event monitoring (serious adverse events and events of clinical&#xD;
      interest will be collected for 90 days after the end of treatment or 30 days after the end of&#xD;
      treatment if the subject initiates new anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects within the pembrolizumab arm who discontinue after 24 months of therapy for reasons&#xD;
      other than disease progression or intolerability or who discontinue after attaining a CR may&#xD;
      be eligible for up to one year of retreatment after they have experienced radiographic&#xD;
      disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who discontinue for reasons other than disease progression will have post-treatment&#xD;
      follow-up for disease status until disease progression, initiating a non-study cancer&#xD;
      treatment, withdrawing consent, or becoming lost to follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be followed by telephone for overall survival until death, withdrawal of&#xD;
      consent, or the end of the study.&#xD;

             subject may also provide consent for Biomedical Research. However, the subject may&#xD;
             participate in the main trial without participating in Biomedical Research.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Be 19 years of age on day of signing informed consent&#xD;

             of the tissue sample quality for assessment of biomarker status. Repeat samples may be&#xD;
             required if adequate tissue is not provided. Newly obtained endoscopic biopsy&#xD;
             specimens are preferred to archived samples and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded&#xD;
