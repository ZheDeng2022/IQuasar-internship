  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spanish dry-cured ham has been shown a source of antihypertensive peptides in mice. To date,&#xD;
      no clinical study has been performed in humans to check the effects of bioactive peptides&#xD;
      produced naturally during the processing of pork dry-cured ham on blood pressure. Therefore,&#xD;
      the aim of the present study is to investigate whether consuming peptides from cured pork ham&#xD;
      with demonstrated angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity lowers blood&#xD;
      pressure (BP) and improves other risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To demonstrate the lowering effects of bioactive peptides from cured pork ham&#xD;
      with &gt;10 months dry-curing process in humans. To check for other possible benefits related to&#xD;
      dry-cured ham intake such as: platelet activation and cardiovascular risk factors.&#xD;

      A two-arm cross-over clinical study with a diet control will be assessed at the Catholic&#xD;
      University of Murcia (UCAM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recruitment of 50 volunteers will be attempted in order to fulfil the UCC calculations. The&#xD;
      50 patients will be divided into two groups (25 vs 25). One group will receive dry-cured pork&#xD;
      ham of &gt;10 months proteolysis (intervention product) while the other will receive cooked,&#xD;
      uncured ham (control product), each for one month. After two weeks wash out, the groups will&#xD;
      be exchanged for one additional month. In this way, each group will take cooked ham and&#xD;
      dry-cured pork ham for 28 days each arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pork hams Two pork hams from the same raw meat will be used in the present study: dry-cured&#xD;
      pork ham with &gt;10 months dry-curing process as the intervention product and cooked, uncured&#xD;
      ham as the control product. Both products will be purchased in vacuum bags and labelled with&#xD;
      safety information (expiration date, nutritional composition and storage information).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dry-cured ham with reduced salt will be used in order to decrease the sodium intake that&#xD;
      could affect BP too. Such ham contains 25% lower salt than similar products on the market&#xD;
      (3,7g vs 4,5g/100g) (see leaflet of a possible ham enclosed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dry-cured ham (80g) will be taken daily by the volunteers (50% humidity); BP will be measured&#xD;
      as follows. In order to counteract the higher water contain (70% humidity), a higher amount&#xD;
      of cooked ham will be given to the control groups (100g). Besides, cooked ham contains 2.5g&#xD;
      salt/100g which is in relation with the 2,96g salt/80g reduced salt dry-cured ham. A&#xD;
      restriction list food will be also given to the volunteers in order to control salt intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers Caucasian men and women, aged 35-60 years, in good general health with an average&#xD;
      of systolic arterial pressure &gt;130 mmHg and diastolic &gt; 80 mmHg will be recruited. Exclusion&#xD;
      criteria are: smokers, Diabetes mellitus, diagnosed and treated hypertension, history of&#xD;
      cardiovascular events (stroke, myocardial infarction or peripheral vascular disease),&#xD;
      medications: anti-hypertensives, vasodilators, lipid lowering therapies and fish oil&#xD;
      supplements unless willing to discontinue prior to and during study (all other supplements&#xD;
      will be assessed on a case by case basis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weight, height, body mass index and waist circumference will be measured at the beginning of&#xD;
      the study by qualified nurses. A list of restricted food will be given at the beginning of&#xD;
      the study in order to avoid excessive salt consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides, three 24h intake surveys will be conducted for three no consecutive days (one of&#xD;
      them on Sunday) during the study. Another survey regarding their diet habits and salt intake&#xD;
      will be also conducted three times, once with each ham and in wash out period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood pressure measurements Blood pressure will be measured with two different approaches:&#xD;
      24h ambulatory monitoring of BP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      24h ambulatory monitoring. A 24h recording will be assessed to all the volunteers included in&#xD;
      the study at four different time points (before/after control product and before/after&#xD;
      intervention product). Volunteers will be appointed for a blood extraction and a digital&#xD;
      manometer device OMRON M24/7 BP5 properly calibrated will be installed to each volunteer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Home auto-monitoring of BP. Auto-measurement of BP will be performed following the&#xD;
      recommendations of the Spanish Society of Hypertension, Spanish League Against Hypertension&#xD;
      (SEHLELHA) and the European Society of Hypertension (ESH) three times during each&#xD;
      intervention. On the day of first appointment at the doctor office, individuals will be&#xD;
      taught how to auto-measure its BP at home and the dominant arm will be determined. A digital&#xD;
      manometer device OMROM 705CP properly calibrated will be given to each volunteer for a short&#xD;
      period of time. BP will be measured 3 times during each interventional product (cured pork&#xD;
      ham and cooked ham) as follows. The three different days, the volunteer will be asked to&#xD;
      measure three times per day (before breakfast, 2h after pork consumption -preferably before&#xD;
      lunch- and before dinner), and each measurement will be repeated for three times, about one&#xD;
      minute apart. The volunteer will measure its BP seated after resting 5 min in this position,&#xD;
      he will not smoke, ingest food or caffeine beverages (coffee, tea or colas), or exercise&#xD;
      (including stair climbing) in the previous 30 minutes prior to the time of measurement.&#xD;
      Measurements will be done in the dominant arm. The systolic and diastolic blood pressure&#xD;
      readings will be recorded. The mean of the three measures will be used for all analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biochemical parameters Blood will be taken before each phase (cured pork ham/cooked ham) and&#xD;
      after the end of such intakes, following by a 2 weeks wash out period (total 4 time points).&#xD;
      Blood analysis will be performed after fasting for at least 8 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood lipid profile (total cholesterol, HDL, LDL and triglycerides); hemogram, plasma&#xD;
      glucose, creatinine, albumin and uric acid will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma will be collected and stored at -80ºC for further analysis such as C reactive protein,&#xD;
      fibrinogen and interleukins if the case.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to provide a 24-hour urine collection and they will be given&#xD;
      written and verbal instructions for the 24-hour collection. The first urine of the day will&#xD;
      be discarded and all urine over the following 24 hours will be collected in standard&#xD;
      containers that will be provided. Total volume of the collection will be measured by the&#xD;
      volunteers. Urine collections will be rejected if 24-hour urinary volumes were less than 250&#xD;
      mL, or if the timing of the collection fell outside the range of 20-28 hours. In accordance&#xD;
      with the standard procedure, urinary sodium and potassium will be measured using ion&#xD;
      selecting electrode method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Daily salt intake will be estimated based on calculation of 24-hour urinary sodium excretion&#xD;
      on the assumption that all sodium ingested was in the form of sodium chloride.&#xD;
