      The study will be an open-label phase 2 clinical trial of a single dose of an inactivated&#xD;
      H7N9 influenza vaccine (non-adjuvanted). The subjects of the study will have previously&#xD;
      participated in DMID trial 07-0023, evaluating inactivated Influenza A/H7N7 vaccine. In the&#xD;
      previous study healthy adults 18 to 40 years old were randomized to receive two doses, 28&#xD;
      days apart, of placebo or 7.5, 15, 45, or 90 ug of the influenza vaccine by IM injection in a&#xD;
      1:1 ratio (N=25/vaccine group and 25 in placebo group). The primary objectives are to 1)&#xD;
      assess the safety and reactogenicity of a single dose A/H7N9 vaccine in individuals who&#xD;
      previously received two IM doses of an A/H7N7 vaccine or are A/H7 vaccine-naïve and 2) To&#xD;
      assess the serum hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) antibody responses against A/H7N9&#xD;
      approximately 28 days following receipt of a single dose of A/H7N9 vaccine in individuals who&#xD;
      previously received two IM doses of A/H7N7 vaccine or are A/H7 vaccine-naïve.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, open-label study in up to 50 males and non-pregnant females, 19 to 50&#xD;
      years old, inclusive, who are in good health and meet all entry criteria. The study is&#xD;
      designed to assess the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of a single dose of a&#xD;
      monovalent inactivated influenza A/H7N9 virus vaccine (45 mcg of HA/0.75 mL) manufactured by&#xD;
      Sanofi Pasteur administered to healthy adults who previously received two doses of monovalent&#xD;
      inactivated influenza A/H7N7 virus vaccine manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur or one or two doses&#xD;
      of placebo in Protocol 07-0023. All subjects will receive a single dose of the inactivated&#xD;
      influenza A/H7N9 vaccine delivered intramuscularly. Reactogenicity will be measured by the&#xD;
      occurrence of solicited injection site and systemic reactions from the time of the study&#xD;
      vaccination Day 1/Visit 01 through 8 days after the study vaccination. Unsolicited&#xD;
      non-serious adverse events (AEs) will be collected from the time of the study vaccination&#xD;
      through roughly 28 days after the study vaccination. Serious adverse events (SAEs) and&#xD;
      new-onset chronic medical conditions will be collected from the time of the study vaccination&#xD;
      through roughly 6 months after the study vaccination. Immunogenicity testing against A/H7N9&#xD;
      and A/H7N7 antigens will include performing hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) and&#xD;
      neutralizing (Neut) antibody assays on serum obtained immediately prior to the study&#xD;
      vaccination, and roughly 8 and 28 days after the study vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An additional 60 mL of venous blood will be drawn immediately prior to the study vaccination,&#xD;
      and roughly 8 and 28 days after the study vaccination for exploratory cellular immunology&#xD;
      assays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of this study for each subject will be roughly 6 months. The primary objectives&#xD;
      are 1. to assess the safety and reactogenicity of a single dose monovalent inactivated&#xD;
      influenza A/H7N9 virus vaccine in individuals who previously received two intramuscular doses&#xD;
      of a monovalent inactivated influenza A/H7N7 virus vaccine or are A/H7 vaccine-naïve. 2. To&#xD;
      assess the serum hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) antibody responses against A/H7N9 roughly&#xD;
      28 days following receipt of a single dose of a monovalent inactivated influenza A/H7N9 virus&#xD;
      vaccine in individuals who previously received two intramuscular doses of a monovalent&#xD;
      inactivated influenza A/H7N7 virus vaccine or are A/H7 vaccine-naïve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are 1. To assess study-vaccine related unsolicited non-serious&#xD;
      adverse events following receipt of one dose of a monovalent inactivated influenza A/H7N9&#xD;
      virus vaccine in individuals who previously received two intramuscular doses of a monovalent&#xD;
      inactivated influenza A/H7N7 virus vaccine or are A/H7 vaccine-naïve. 2. To assess new-onset&#xD;
      chronic medical conditions following receipt of one dose of a monovalent inactivated&#xD;
      influenza A/H7N9 virus vaccine in individuals who previously received two intramuscular doses&#xD;
      of a monovalent inactivated influenza A/H7N7 virus vaccine or are A/H7 vaccine-naïve.3) To&#xD;
      assess the serum HAI antibody responses against A/H7N9 at baseline and about 8 days following&#xD;
      receipt of a single dose of a monovalent inactivated influenza A/H7N9 virus vaccine in&#xD;
      individuals who previously received two intramuscular doses of a monovalent inactivated&#xD;
      influenza A/H7N7 virus vaccine or are A/H7 vaccine-naïve. 4. To assess the serum neutralizing&#xD;
      (Neut) antibody responses against A/H7N9 at baseline and roughly 8 and 28 days following&#xD;
      receipt of a one dose of a monovalent inactivated influenza A/H7N7 virus vaccine or are A/H7&#xD;
      vaccine-naïve.&#xD;

             etc., or that is done for financial reasons, as long as in the same class of&#xD;
             medication, will not be considered a deviation of this inclusion criterion. Any change&#xD;
