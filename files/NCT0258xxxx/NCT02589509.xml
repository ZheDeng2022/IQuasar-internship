      The purpose of this study is to test an innovative combination of direct-attention training&#xD;
      and metacognitive training in the treatment of attention impairments in Veterans with&#xD;
      moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) who report experiencing attentional problems.&#xD;
      Enrolled participants will be randomized to receive either the direct-attention training or&#xD;
      metacognitive training first and then will be crossed over to receive the opposite&#xD;
      intervention. The study will consist of two treatment periods of 4 weeks and a post-treatment&#xD;
      4 weeks later. In addition to the rehabilitation treatments, participants will also perform&#xD;
      measures of complex functional activities (e.g., independent activities of daily living or&#xD;
      IADLs) and neurocognitive tests of attention-control functions. Participants will also&#xD;
      perform an attentional task that probes the function of three different attentional systems&#xD;
      while brain wave activity (i.e., electroencephalography or EEG) is being recorded in order to&#xD;
      assess changes in brain function that may be improved by the rehabilitation approach. Planned&#xD;
      enrollment will be 36 Veterans.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Attention impairment is ubiquitous in TBI survivors. This is a devastating impairment because&#xD;
      attention is the backbone of cognitive systems. Attention is requisite for other cognitive&#xD;
      processes that are vital to everyday functioning such as memory, problem solving, language&#xD;
      skills, and the cognitive control of behavior. Studies of attention training have shown&#xD;
      improved attention on laboratory measures, but limited translation to real-world tasks.&#xD;
      Notably, these previously-tested rehabilitation approaches have not included training in the&#xD;
      very cognitive processes needed for translation of training to everyday tasks which include&#xD;
      internal verbalization and self-monitoring, also called metacognitive strategies. One&#xD;
      training method for metacognitive strategies has shown promise, but is lacking in basic&#xD;
      attention training. Rehabilitation specialists have recently argued for a rehabilitation&#xD;
      approach wherein both basic foundational attention and metacognitive strategies should be&#xD;
      synergistically combined. Consequently, the investigators will test an innovative combination&#xD;
      of direct-attention training and metacognitive training for which the other compensates&#xD;
      disadvantages of each. Because of the promise of each type of training separately, and the&#xD;
      potential additive effects of the combination, it is critical to test this combined attention&#xD;
      and metacognitive training in Veteran survivors of chronic moderate-to-severe traumatic brain&#xD;
      injury (TBI). The investigators will address the following two specific aims: the&#xD;
      investigators propose to conduct a pilot study to examine cognitive rehabilitation therapy&#xD;
      (CRT) effects in a group of Veterans with chronic moderate to severe TBI (m/sTBI), focused on&#xD;
      remediating attention-control impairments using both direct-attention and&#xD;
      metacognitive-strategy training approaches in a AB/BA crossover design with 1-month follow-up&#xD;
      to address the following two specific aims: 1) Test treatment response to combined&#xD;
      direct-attention and metacognitive-strategy training in Veterans with chronic m/sTBI; and 2)&#xD;
      identify mechanisms and biomarkers of rehabilitation-related neuroplasticity. Under the first&#xD;
      aim the investigators will test for effects of combined direct-attention and&#xD;
      metacognitive-strategy training on measures of complex functional activities and&#xD;
      neurocognitive tests of attention-control functions. Under the second aim, the investigators&#xD;
      will test effects of the their CRT approach on behavioral and brain activity while&#xD;
      participants perform a well-validated attentional task that probes the function of three&#xD;
      dissociable attentional systems. The approach is innovative because it combines a&#xD;
      theoretically motivated and novel approach to address a significant source of disability in&#xD;
      Veteran survivors of TBI. The proposed research is significant because findings will form the&#xD;
      foundation for a larger-scale trial to enable us to determine the durability of gains and the&#xD;
      functional impact of treatment on Veteran's real world activities and to more positively&#xD;
      shape healthcare for our Veterans who are suffering from TBI. Outcome measures will include&#xD;
      standardized tests of neurocognitive functioning such as attention and other cognitive&#xD;
      skills, measures of self care, ability to live independently, social role participation, life&#xD;
      satisfaction, TBI-related quality of life, mood/anxiety, and attention-related scalp-recorded&#xD;
      brain event-related potentials (ERPs, derived from electroencephalography).&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline ANT ERP (P3) Executive Amplitude assessed at 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The ANT combines a covert cueing paradigm with a classic flanker task to behaviorally probe independent but interactive components of attention in a single experimental paradigm. Scalp-recorded electroencephalography (EEG) will be acquired from 64 sensors while participants perform the ANT to derive event-related potentials (ERPs) reflecting alerting, orienting, and executive-control components of attention and enable probing of brain plasticity associated with attention rehabilitation.</description>

    <measure>Mayo-Portland Adaptability Inventory, 4th edition (MPAI-4) - Ability Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline MPAI-4 Ability Score assessed pretreatment</time_frame>
    <description>Assesses global outcome, including ability, adjustment and community participation indices. The MPAI-4 is a 35-item questionnaire-based inventory that will be completed study staff and TBI survivors. It offers three subscales (Ability, Adjustment, and Participation) and has well-documented psychometric properties. MPAI-4 items represent the range of physical, cognitive, emotional, behavioral, and societal problems that TBI survivors often encounter; it also assess major obstacles to community integration.</description>
