  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cachexia is a systemic catabolic syndrome with apparent effect on skeletal muscles, tolerance&#xD;
      to chemotherapy, early toxicity and quality of life; however, its effect on cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      function is not well understood. Preclinical studies demonstrated diaphragmatic muscle&#xD;
      wasting(29) and left ventricular wasting and fibrosis associated with mouse cachexia&#xD;
      models.(40) Many patients, who experience cancer cachexia, describe a generalized debility&#xD;
      and a sense of breathlessness(41) despite adequate oxygenation in the peripheral blood as&#xD;
      measured by pulse oximetry. Whether this is related to deconditioning associated with&#xD;
      chemotherapy or related to direct effect on cardiac and diaphragmatic muscles remains&#xD;
      unknown. In this pilot study, the investigators propose to perform a preliminary evaluation&#xD;
      of the cardiopulmonary function in patients with pancreatic cancer, who are likely to develop&#xD;
      cachexia, to assess for the feasibility of performing a larger prospective study to&#xD;
      understand the impact of cancer cachexia on cardiopulmonary function. This pilot study will&#xD;
      provide the foundation to potentially identify cachexia in early stages (pre-cachexia) to&#xD;
      develop pharmacological or exercise based interventions to prevent or delay its progression.&#xD;
      Based on clinical experience and published literature, it is expected that 60-70% of patients&#xD;
      will have &gt;10% weight loss during the course of this disease. More commonly, this is&#xD;
      associated with clinical or radiographic disease progression, but certainly it can happen&#xD;
      throughout the course of the disease even without disease progression.&#xD;

      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the feasibility of performing a prospective cardiopulmonary and physical function&#xD;
      assessment in patients with advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) who are expected&#xD;
      to develop cachexia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To measure the changes in maximal expiratory pressure (MEP) and maximal inspiratory&#xD;
           pressure (MIP) in patients with progressive PDAC and/or cancer associated cachexia&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To measure changes in strain echocardiography in patients with progressive PDAC and/or&#xD;
           cancer associated cachexia&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess functional changes in patients with progressive PDAC and/or cancer associated&#xD;
           cachexia&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To assess body composition changes associated with cachexia or disease progression&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To measure the levels of cytokines from peripheral blood in patients with cachexia&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study procedures will be done at two time points (T1=baseline or study entry, T2=at&#xD;
      disease progression or development of cachexia). Patients will undergo echocardiography with&#xD;
      strain evaluation at Indiana University Health Echocardiography Laboratory and pulmonary&#xD;
      function tests as per institutional guidelines at IUH PFT laboratory at University Hospital.&#xD;
      Patients will also have 20mL (2 red top tubes) of blood drawn for the studies outlined in&#xD;
      Section 7.5. Standard of care labs will be taken from the patient's medical records. Patients&#xD;
      also will be evaluated using three standardized functional assessment tools commonly utilized&#xD;
      in physical rehabilitation: 1) 5 Times Sit-to-Stand Test; 2) 6 Minute Walk Test; and 3) grip&#xD;
      dynamometry. Standard of care CT scan obtained at the time of tumor assessment will enable&#xD;
      the investigators to assess body muscle mass as described in Section 7.4. In addition, the&#xD;
      investigators will administer three standardized survey tools to assess quality of life and&#xD;
      prior level of function: 1) The Short Form 36 (SF-36); 2) Lower Extremity Functional Scale&#xD;
      (LEFS); and 3) Scored Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the risk of clinical deterioration or drop out of the study and inability to undergo&#xD;
      T2 evaluation, the investigators will plan on enrolling 133% of desired number of subjects,&#xD;
      accounting for 33% missing T2 data. This is likely a high number; however, this will enable&#xD;
      data collection from 12-15 patients at both time points and all proposed tests.&#xD;
