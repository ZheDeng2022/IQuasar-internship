      Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) arises in advanced-stages of malignancies and frequently&#xD;
      heralds a poor prognosis.If the underlying malignancy is chemo sensitive (e.g., small-cell&#xD;
      carcinoma of lung &amp; lymphoma), systemic chemotherapy may control the pleural effusion.&#xD;
      Instilling of sclerosing agents into the pleural cavity (pleurodesis) is a common method for&#xD;
      the management of MPE. According to a recent survey, tetracycline or its derivative&#xD;
      (doxycycline) is the preferred agent for performing pleurodesis at many centers. In a&#xD;
      previous study from the investigators' center, the investigators have demonstrated equal&#xD;
      efficacy of iodopovidone in comparison to talc in inducing pleural symphysis. Also,&#xD;
      iodopovidone has been postulated to have anti-neoplastic effects and hence may help in&#xD;
      reducing the drain output. Apart from these benefits iodopovidone is easily available and is&#xD;
      cost effective. The investigators believe that iodopovidone will have better efficacy than&#xD;
      doxycycline in inducing pleurodesis in malignant pleural effusion.&#xD;

      Introduction &amp; Review of literature Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) arises in&#xD;
      advanced-stages of malignancies and frequently heralds a poor prognosis. Most patients with&#xD;
      MPE are symptomatic. The most common symptom is exertional dyspnea. Most patients undergo&#xD;
      chemotherapy or local treatments to palliate symptoms such as dyspnea, cough &amp; chest pain, to&#xD;
      improve quality of life. If the underlying malignancy is chemo sensitive (e.g., small-cell&#xD;
      carcinoma of lung &amp; lymphoma), systemic chemotherapy may control the pleural effusion.1&#xD;
      However, when pleural effusion persists or reaccumulates after chemotherapy, the management&#xD;
      of refractory MPE includes local therapeutic methods such as thoracentesis, pleurodesis,&#xD;
      pleurectomy, or pleuroperitoneal shunting. Instilling of sclerosing agents into the pleural&#xD;
      cavity (pleurodesis) is a common method for the management of MPE. For several years, various&#xD;
      agents such as anti-neoplastics (e.g., nitrogen mustard, bleomycin), tetracycline&#xD;
      derivatives, talc, erythromycin, silver nitrate, and povidone-iodine have been injected into&#xD;
      the pleural cavity to create pleurodesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to a recent survey, tetracycline or its derivative (doxycycline) is the preferred&#xD;
      agent for performing pleurodesis at many centers.7 However, intravenous preparation of&#xD;
      doxycycline is not freely available and also induces severe inflammation in the pleura that&#xD;
      results in severe chest pain and discomfort to the patient. In a previous study from the&#xD;
      investigators' center, the investigators have demonstrated equal efficacy of iodopovidine in&#xD;
      comparison to talc in inducing pleural symphysis.8 Also, iodopovidine has been postulated to&#xD;
      have anti-neoplastic effects and hence may help in reducing the drain output. Apart from&#xD;
      these benefits iodopovidine is easily available and is cost effective. The investigators&#xD;
      believe that iodopovidone will have better efficacy than doxycycline in inducing pleurodesis&#xD;
      in malignant pleural effusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study hypothesis In patients with malignant pleural effusion, pleurodesis with intrapleural&#xD;
      instillation of iodopovidone will have better efficacy in comparison with doxycycline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: This will be a randomized double blind study conducted in the Department of&#xD;
      Pulmonary Medicine, PGIMER, Chandigarh.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection of cases: A total of 100 consecutive patients of malignant pleural effusion will be&#xD;
      enrolled in the study. Patients will be equally randomized to undergo pleurodesis, either&#xD;
      with intrapleural iodopovidone or intrapleural doxycycline. A written informed consent will&#xD;
      be taken from all the patients participating in the present study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: Patient will be randomized 1:1 to undergo pleurodesis either by instillation&#xD;
      of intrapleural iodopovidone or intrapleural doxycycline. The randomization sequence will be&#xD;
      computer generated. The sequence generated will be kept in a sealed opaque envelope and will&#xD;
      be opened at the time of procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure: A chest tube (24-28 F) will be inserted through the fifth intercostal space in the&#xD;
      mid-axillary line, to achieve complete drainage of the effusion and/or complete lung&#xD;
      expansion. In case of large effusions, drainage will be spread over 24-48 h to prevent&#xD;
      re-expansion pulmonary oedema. Pleurodesis will be performed when the daily drainage output&#xD;
      will decrease to &lt;150 mL/day and chest radiograph demonstrates apposition of pleural&#xD;
      surfaces. In cases of pneumothorax, complete lung expansion and absence of any air leaks will&#xD;
      be confirmed before instillation of the chemical agent. A chest radiograph will be performed&#xD;
      to confirm complete re-expansion. Normal saline solution (50 mL) containing lignocaine (2&#xD;
      mg/kg ideal body weight) will be infused through the chest tube. Simultaneously, tramadol&#xD;
      (100 mg) will be administered intravenously for analgesia. After 15 minutes pleurodesis will&#xD;
      be performed either by instillation of doxycycline or by iodopovidone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Doxycycline: 500 mg of doxycycline will be dissolved in 50 ml of normal saline. The&#xD;
      combination will then be instilled through the chest tube in the pleural cavity and the chest&#xD;
      tube drain will be clamped for 4 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Iodopovidone: 20 ml of 10% betadine (Microshield, Johnson and Johnson, Solan, India) will be&#xD;
      dissolved in 80 mL of normal saline. The combination will then be instilled through the chest&#xD;
      tube in the pleural cavity and the chest tube drain will be clamped for 4 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The chest tube will be flushed with 50 mL of normal saline after instillation of study drug&#xD;
      (doxycycline or iodopovidone).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoint: The chest tube will be removed if the drainage output is less than 100mL of pleural&#xD;
      fluid and there is complete lung re-expansion with no residual pneumothorax on chest&#xD;
      radiograph. Pulse, blood pressure, respiratory rate and temperature will be measured before&#xD;
      and every 30 minutes after the procedure for 6 hours. Chest pain after pleurodesis will be&#xD;
      recorded on a visual analogue scale (VAS) of 0-100 mm. Patients will be given additional&#xD;
      intravenous tramadol (50 mg) on an as-needed basis after the procedure. Any complications&#xD;
      related to the procedure will be recorded. Complications such as hypotension, fever, acute&#xD;
      respiratory failure and empyema will be noted. Patients will be followed up at 1 week, at 1,&#xD;
      3 and 6 months.&#xD;
