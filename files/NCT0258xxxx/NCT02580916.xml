    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) provide validated evidence of health and quality of&#xD;
      life (QoL) from the patient perspective. Several national PROMs programmes have been&#xD;
      implemented in the National Health Service - specifically for common elective procedures.&#xD;
      Local implementation is varied across settings and populations. The incidence of non-melanoma&#xD;
      skin cancer (NMSC) is rapidly increasing, posing considerable burden on UK healthcare&#xD;
      resources, yet there is limited evidence of use of PROMs in NMSC and little information about&#xD;
      patients' perceived health and QoL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will explore feasibility of implementing a skin cancer-specific PROM - Skin Cancer&#xD;
      Quality of Life Impact Tool (SCQOLIT) for NMSC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three hundred patients with a pathological diagnosis of NMSC undergoing all treatment&#xD;
      modalities will be recruited to complete SCQOLIT questionnaires at baseline, at 3, 6 and 9&#xD;
      months. Participation and response rates, missing data and individual change scores will be&#xD;
      analysed. Staff and patients will be interviewed to explore acceptability and feasibility of&#xD;
      collecting PROMs data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interim results of the project to date will be presented. Feasibility will be assessed by&#xD;
      evaluating number of eligible patients, number of consenting patients, reasons for not&#xD;
      consenting and participant number. Individual longitudinal change in scores, response rates&#xD;
      and psychometric properties of the SCQOLIT will be reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implications:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acceptability and feasibility of the SCQOLIT tool has never been rigorously assessed in&#xD;
      Dermatology clinics. A validated NMSC-specific PROM would help standardize multi-centred&#xD;
      trials, allow robust evaluation of quality of care and more appropriately direct healthcare&#xD;
      resources to improve QoL in patients with NMSC.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skin cancer is the most rapidly increasing cancer type in fair-skinned populations worldwide.&#xD;
      Although non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) are rarely life threatening, both disease and&#xD;
      treatments can be associated with substantial morbidity and confer significant financial&#xD;
      burden to the National Health Service (NHS). Consequently, the British Association of&#xD;
      Dermatologists (BAD) commissioned the Patient-reported Outcomes Measurement Group, Oxford to&#xD;
      review the evidence for PROMs for skin cancer. The authors concluded that cancer-specific&#xD;
      quality of life (QOL) questionnaires appeared more sensitive than generic PROMs e.g. the&#xD;
      Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), in capturing relevant QOL issues. In the NMSC&#xD;
      population, these issues include scarring, disfigurement, anxiety and fear of future skin&#xD;
      cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One skin cancer-specific PROM that was evaluated was the Skin Cancer Quality of Life Impact&#xD;
      Tool (SCQOLIT). The SCQOLIT is a ten-item instrument developed specifically for patients with&#xD;
      non-metastatic skin cancer, which has demonstrated evidence in favour of reproducibility,&#xD;
      validity, internal consistency but requires further evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The decision to evaluate the SCQOLIT in this study, includes its similarity in overall format&#xD;
      and brevity to that of the DLQI which is a PROM now widely used in routine medical&#xD;
      dermatology clinical practice. The SCQOLIT takes less than five minutes for the patient to&#xD;
      complete and has a similar score calculation to the DLQI. Acceptability and feasibility of&#xD;
      this tool has never been rigorously assessed in Dermatology clinics. Studies evaluating PROMs&#xD;
      in NMSC have been largely assessed in relation to surgical treatments yet basal cell&#xD;
      carcinoma can be effectively treated using medical treatments e.g. topical immunomodulators&#xD;
      and photodynamic therapy, and to date, PROMs have not been investigated in these&#xD;
      sub-populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This feasibility study is designed to evaluate the SCQOLIT questionnaire, and aims to&#xD;
      establish its utility and impact in patients with NMSC. The investigators will assess both&#xD;
      patient and clinician acceptability of the SCQOLIT questionnaire tool and hope to identify&#xD;
      any unmet needs, which can potentially inform future clinical decisions and/or service&#xD;
      planning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients referred to Dermatology Tumour outpatient clinics with a clinically suspected&#xD;
      NMSC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be four categories of participants, Groups 1 - 3 are participants with a new&#xD;
      diagnosis of NMSC (primary or recurrent) on any site of the body:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 (Postal) - this will include those patients with a 'low risk' NMSC (namely basal cell&#xD;
      carcinoma)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 (Clinic-based) - this will include those patients with a 'moderate to high risk' NMSC&#xD;
      (namely SCC or other rare NMSC)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 3 (Interview) - these will be volunteers selected from Groups 1 and 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 4 (Focus Group: Clinicians) - this will include any Dermatology staff member who is&#xD;
      involved in consenting and collecting PROMS data and has a role for direct care of patients&#xD;
      attending Dermatology outpatient clinics.&#xD;
