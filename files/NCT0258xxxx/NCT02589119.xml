  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to study the safety of autologous mesenchymal stromal cell transfer&#xD;
      using a biomatrix (the Gore Fistula Plug) in a Phase I study using a single dose of 20&#xD;
      million cells. 15 adult patients, ages 18 years and older with cryptoglandular fistulas will&#xD;
      be enrolled. Subjects will undergo standard adjuvant therapy including drainage of infection&#xD;
      and placement of a draining seton. Six weeks post placement of the draining seton, the seton&#xD;
      will be replaced with the MSC loaded Gore Fistula Plug; fistula plug as per current clinical&#xD;
      practice. The subjects will be subsequently followed for fistula response and closure for 24&#xD;
      months. This is an autologous product derived from the patient and used only for the same&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;

    <time_frame>2-24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will have a health assessment and blood work measured at each study visit to monitor for adverse events, such as worsening of the cryptoglandular fistulizing disease, abnormal laboratory values, or significant abnormalities in physical examination. The Outcome Measure will be the number of Participants With Abnormal Laboratory Values and/or Adverse Events That Are Related to Treatment</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of participants with response to the treatment regarding potential cessation of drainage from their fistula.</measure>
    <time_frame>2-24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will have a clinical assessment of fistula drainage. Participants will be assessed during an office examination if their fistula is draining or not. The Outcome Measure will be the presence or absence of fistula drainage.</description>

    <measure>Number of participants with response to the treatment regarding their score based on the Cleveland Clinic Florida (Wexner) fecal incontinence questionnaire.</measure>
    <time_frame>6-12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will have an assessment with the Cleveland Clinic Florida (Wexner) fecal incontinence questionnaire. Participants have the questionnaire administered within one week before plug implantation and at the 6 month and 12 months follow up visits. The Outcome Measure will be the how the participants' score change over time.</description>

    <measure>Number of participants with radiographic healing response to the treatment.</measure>
    <time_frame>2-24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will have an assessment of healing radiographically by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Participants' fistula tracts will be assessed during a MRI if their fistula is healing. The Outcome Measure will be the closure or persistence of fistula tract.</description>
