  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of study CA601.2 is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or&#xD;
      recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of ABI-011 when administered by intravenous (IV) infusion on&#xD;
      Days 1, 8, and 15, followed by a week of rest, in patients with advanced solid tumor&#xD;
      malignancies or lymphomas. The MTD will be determined using a standard 3+3 design. The&#xD;
      secondary objectives are to evaluate the safety and toxicity profile, to evaluate the plasma&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (PK), to assess the biological activity and pharmacodynamics, and to make a&#xD;
      preliminary assessment of tumor response in patients with advanced solid tumors or lymphomas.&#xD;
      The exploratory objectives are to determine the genomic and proteomic profile of patients'&#xD;
      tumors to identify gene mutations, gene amplifications, levels of protein expression, and&#xD;
      pinpoint oncoproteins. Correlations between genomic/proteomic profiles and efficacy outcomes&#xD;
      will be assessed and principal metabolites of ABI-011 will be determined, if possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 45-60 patients will be treated to determine dose limiting toxicities (DLTs),&#xD;
      the MTD, and/or RP2D of ABI-011. Once the RP2D is identified, expansion of this cohort (up to&#xD;
      10 patients) will occur.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ABI-011 is a novel, albumin-bound formulation of a potent thiocolchicine analog, IDN 5404,&#xD;
      with a mean particle size of approximately 100 nanometers (nm). The active drug, IDN 5404, is&#xD;
      related to the colchicine family of tubulin-binding compounds that have been found to have&#xD;
      vascular-disrupting activity in vivo. Studies are ongoing to determine whether IDN 5404 has&#xD;
      vascular-disrupting activity. As a dimer, IDN 5404 has an additional activity as an inhibitor&#xD;
      of topoisomerase I, a critical enzyme in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair mechanisms.&#xD;
      Although the active compound has limited solubility, IDN 5404 formulated as ABI-011 is&#xD;
      soluble in saline, facilitating IV dosing and delivery of the active agent to tumors and the&#xD;
      tumor vasculature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of study CA601.2 is to determine the MTD or RP2D of ABI-011 when&#xD;
      administered by IV infusion on Days 1, 8, and 15, followed by a week of rest, in patients&#xD;
      with advanced solid tumor malignancies or lymphomas. The MTD will be determined using a&#xD;
      standard 3+3 design. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the safety and toxicity&#xD;
      profile, to evaluate the plasma PK (elimination rate constant, elimination half-life, volume&#xD;
      of distribution, maximum serum concentration (Cmax), time to maximum concentration (tmax),&#xD;
      and area under the time-concentration curve to time infinity (AUCinf), to assess the&#xD;
      biological activity and pharmacodynamics, and to make a preliminary assessment of tumor&#xD;
      response in patients with advanced solid tumors or lymphomas. The exploratory objectives are&#xD;
      to determine the genomic and proteomic profile of patients' tumors to identify gene&#xD;
      mutations, gene amplifications, levels of protein expression, and pinpoint oncoproteins.&#xD;
      Correlations between genomic/proteomic profiles and efficacy outcomes will be assessed and&#xD;
      principal metabolites of ABI-011 will be determined, if possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 45-60 patients will be treated to determine DLTs, the MTD, and/or RP2D of&#xD;
      ABI-011. Once the RP2D is identified, expansion of this cohort (up to 10 patients) will&#xD;
      occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with cytologically or histologically confirmed solid tumor malignancies or lymphoma&#xD;
      for which no curative standard approved therapy is available with an Eastern Cooperative&#xD;
      Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 2 will be included. In the dose-escalation phase&#xD;
      of the study, patients can have measurable or non-measurable disease as defined by Response&#xD;
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), Version 1.1, criteria. In the dose-expansion&#xD;
      phase of the study, only patients with measurable disease will be enrolled. No anti-cancer&#xD;
      therapies (inclusive of investigational therapies) are allowed 5 half-lives/4 weeks&#xD;
      (whichever is longer) prior to study drug administration (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or&#xD;
      mitomycin C).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ABI-011 will be administered via IV infusion for 30 minutes weekly on Days 1, 8, and 15 of a&#xD;
      28-Day cycle. The starting dose will be 2 mg/m2. Patients will be allowed to continue&#xD;
      treatment until they experience progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity, withdraw&#xD;
      consent, or their physician feels it is no longer in their best interest to continue on&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
