    <textblock>
      The combined administration of high dose of oral betamethasone and nebulization of adrenaline&#xD;
      seems to be an attractive therapeutic alternative for reducing the rate of hospitalization&#xD;
      for acute bronchiolitis treated in the emergency department. However, it is essential to&#xD;
      confirm the trend previously observed with this treatment before using it in current&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Rationale: In infancy, bronchiolitis is the most common acute infection of the lower&#xD;
      respiratory tract and is most often caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The&#xD;
      current treatment of bronchiolitis is controversial. Although meta-analysis of nebulized&#xD;
      bronchodilators or corticosteroids treatments failed to show any consistent benefits on&#xD;
      admission rate, they remain widely used in pediatric emergency wards. A recent randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial with a factorial design was conducted to&#xD;
      determine whether treatment with nebulized epinephrine, a short course of high dose of oral&#xD;
      Betamethasone, or both, resulted in a clinically important decrease in hospital admissions&#xD;
      among infants with bronchiolitis who were seen in the emergency department. This study showed&#xD;
      that infants in the epinephrine-betamethasone group were significantly less likely than those&#xD;
      in the placebo group to be admitted by day 7 (relative risk, 0.65; 95% confidence interval,&#xD;
      0.45 to 0.95, P = 0.02). However, after adjustment for multiple comparisons, this result&#xD;
      became insignificant (P = 0.07). This synergistic interaction was not anticipated but gave&#xD;
      hope that the association nebulized epinephrine - short course of oral high dose of&#xD;
      betamethasone might reduce the risk of hospitalization for infants who consulted pediatric&#xD;
      emergencies for a moderate to severe acute bronchiolitis. It is therefore required to conduct&#xD;
      a trial dedicated to this evaluation in the French population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: using Epinephrine-Betamethasone allows to reduce the rate of hospitalization of&#xD;
      mild-to-severe acute viral bronchiolitis seen in pediatric emergency departments.&#xD;
