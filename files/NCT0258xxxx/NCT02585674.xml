      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To demonstrate the non-inferiority of the MyStar DoseCoach (Long-acting Insulin Glargine&#xD;
      Titration Meter) device-supported treat-to-target regimen relative to a routine titration&#xD;
      regimen in the percentage of patients reaching glycemic target, ie, with a mean fasting&#xD;
      self-monitored plasma glucose (FSMPG) value within the target range of 90-130 mg/dL (5.0-7.2&#xD;
      mmol/L) without a severe hypoglycemic episode during the 16-week on-treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the efficacy, safety, and adherence/satisfaction of MyStar DoseCoach&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The maximum study duration will be 21 weeks per patient that will consist of a 4-week&#xD;
      screening period, a 16-week treatment period, and 1-week follow-up period.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Within the last 3 months prior to screening: history of myocardial infarction,&#xD;
             unstable angina, acute coronary syndrome, revascularization procedure, or stroke&#xD;
             requiring hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe or uncontrolled Congestive Heart Failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA]&#xD;
             functional classification III and IV); or inadequately controlled hypertension at the&#xD;
             time of screening with a resting systolic or diastolic blood pressure &gt;180 mmHg or &gt;95&#xD;
             mmHg, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding women or women who intend to become pregnant during the&#xD;
             study period as glycemic control may be unstable and insulin doses may be variable&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential (premenopausal, not surgically sterile for at least 3&#xD;
             months prior to the time of screening) must use an effective contraceptive method&#xD;
             throughout the study. Effective methods of contraception include barrier methods (in&#xD;
             conjunction with spermicide), hormonal contraception, or use of an intrauterine device&#xD;
             (IUD) or intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS).&#xD;
