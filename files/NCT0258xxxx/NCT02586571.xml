    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective cohort study is to investigate breast-milk and breastfeeding&#xD;
      among infants who are exclusively and partially breastfed at 6 months of age in terms of&#xD;
      characteristics that are hypothesised to contribute to growth and development of body&#xD;
      composition in infancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scientific originality lies in the simultaneous sampling of multiple factors that are&#xD;
      believed to contribute to growth and development of body composition in infancy, i.e. energy&#xD;
      content of breast-milk, metabolism-regulating hormones in breast-milk, infant temperament and&#xD;
      appetite. The selection of two predefined study groups, i.e. infants exclusively breastfed&#xD;
      until 6 months of age and infants given complementary foods in addition to breast-milk from&#xD;
      3-4 months of age, gives the opportunity to describe, and perhaps up to some point compare,&#xD;
      what now is described by the World Health Organization and in official Icelandic infant&#xD;
      recommendations as &quot;optimal feeding&quot; and what studies have suggested is &quot;common feeding&quot; in&#xD;
      many countries. The methods are carefully chosen, i.e. appropriate and non-invasive isotopes&#xD;
      and validated questionnaires are used. To our knowledge, no study has reported breast-milk&#xD;
      composition in exclusively vs. partially breastfed infants.&#xD;

      At approximately 5 months of age, all infants in Iceland are invited to receive routine care&#xD;
      (health checkup, immunization etc.) at the well-baby clinics at the primary health care&#xD;
      centers in their neighbourhood. Nurses at well-baby clinics in and around Reykjavik&#xD;
      cooperating with the study investigators screen all infants for eligibility according the&#xD;
      eligibility criteria. Mothers of eligible infants receive oral and written information about&#xD;
      the study and if interested, a written consent is obtained and study investigators are&#xD;
      informed about the potential participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the infant is around 5.5 months of age, the mother is contacted and a home visit by&#xD;
      study investigators scheduled. In the home visit, more detailed information about the study&#xD;
      is given and equipment for predose urine samples are given. The date for the first part of&#xD;
      the study (day 0) is scheduled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day -1 and/or day 0: Mothers sample predose urine sample(s): 2x4 ml for group &quot;Exclusive&#xD;
      Breastfeeding A&quot; and 1x2 ml for groups &quot;Exclusive Breastfeeding B&quot; and &quot;Partial&#xD;
      Breastfeeding&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 0 (home visit by investigators): Infant weighed, drinks 2.5 g/kg body weight + 1 g doubly&#xD;
      labeled water or 0.7 g deuterium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mothers sample postdose urine samples: 6x4 ml for group &quot;Exclusive Breastfeeding A&quot; (days 1,&#xD;
      2, 3, 5, 6, 7) and 2x2 ml for the other groups (days 0+5 hours and day 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mothers of infants in groups &quot;Exclusive Breastfeeding B&quot; and &quot;Partial Breastfeeding&quot; keep a&#xD;
      3-day weighed food record assessing their infants' diet including breast milk (by test&#xD;
      weighing).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 7 (home visit by investigators): 2x10 ml breast milk samples (fore and hind milk) are&#xD;
      obtained, questionnaires answered by mothers: background questionnaire, food frequency&#xD;
      questionnaire on mother's habitual diet, the Baby Eating Behaviour Questionnaire (BEBQ) and&#xD;
      the Infant Behaviour Questionnaire-Revised (IBQ-R).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 9 months of age mothers keep a 3-day weighed food record assessing the infants' diet&#xD;
      including breast milk if the infant is still breastfed (by test weighing).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 12 months of age the primary outcome measure is assessed. Day -1 or day 0: Mothers sample&#xD;
      predose urine sample: 1x2 ml. Day 0 (home visit by investigators): Infant weighed, drinks 1.2&#xD;
      g deuterium. Mothers sample postdose urine samples: 2x2 ml (days 0+5 hours and day 2).&#xD;
      Mothers keep a 3-day weighed food record assessing their infants' diet including breast milk&#xD;
      if the infant is still breastfed (by test weighing).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mothers answer the Child Eating Behaviour Questionnaire (CEBQ).&#xD;
