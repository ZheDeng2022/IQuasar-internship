  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hemophilia A is an inherited (genetic) disease where a protein, factor VIII (FVIII), which&#xD;
      promotes blood clotting is missing or does not work properly. Individuals with hemophilia A&#xD;
      are at risk for bleeding. Bleeding is prevented and/or treated with recombinant factor VIII&#xD;
      (rFVIII), which is an FDA-approved treatment for Hemophilia A. Obesity is common among&#xD;
      patients with hemophilia. Some studies have shown that obese hemophilia patients may be able&#xD;
      to prevent bleeding with a lower dose of clotting factor than the dose they are currently&#xD;
      receiving. The lower dose is calculated based on what a patient should weigh rather than what&#xD;
      he does weigh. This is a clinical research study to test whether calculating rFVIII dosing&#xD;
      based on lean body mass and ideal body weight (what a person should weigh based on his&#xD;
      height) in overweight and obese patients with hemophilia is more accurate than calculating&#xD;
      rFVIII dosing based on what a person actually weighs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a single center, randomized, controlled, open-label, crossover&#xD;
      trial to determine if recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII) dosed according to lean body mass&#xD;
      (LBM) and ideal body weight (IBW) achieves a targeted FVIII recovery with better precision&#xD;
      than based on total body weight (TBW). The investigators hypothesize the use of LBM and IBW&#xD;
      to determine the dose of rFVIII necessary to attain a desired FVIII recovery of 2 +/- 0.2&#xD;
      IU/dl per IU/kg (100 +/- 10%) in overweight and obese (body mass index greater than or equal&#xD;
      to 25 mg/m2), adult males (age 18 or older) with hemophilia A (FVIII activity 40% or less)&#xD;
      will result in a 50% greater proportion of subjects within this range when compared to TBW.&#xD;
      Eligible patients receiving care at the Hemophilia Center of Western Pennsylvania (HCWP) will&#xD;
      be enrolled during clinic visits. Following enrollment and completion of screening&#xD;
      assessment, subjects will present to HCWP for three study visits with each study visit&#xD;
      occurring on successive weeks. Subjects will not have received any rFVIII for a period of at&#xD;
      least 72 hours prior to each study visit. Recombinant FVIII infusion based on TBW, LBM, or&#xD;
      IBW will take place during each study visit, and the order will be determined by&#xD;
      randomization. During each study visit, FVIII levels will be assessed by obtaining blood&#xD;
      samples before and at 10 and 30 minutes and 1 hour after infusion. Outcomes include the&#xD;
      proportion of subjects achieving a desired peak FVIII recovery value of 2 +/- 0.2 IU/dl per&#xD;
      IU/kg (100 +/- 10%) at 10 minutes following infusion of rFVIII dosed according to LBM and&#xD;
      TBW, IBW and TBW, and LBM and IBW. The investigators will use mixed effects logistic&#xD;
      regression to investigate the effect of using different weight-based dosing methods on&#xD;
      attaining target FVIII levels. We aim to have 24 subjects successfully complete the study.&#xD;
