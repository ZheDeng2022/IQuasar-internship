  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For participants whose leg bones don't line up properly, extra stress is placed on either the&#xD;
      inner or outer side of the knee joint due to uneven transfer of body-weight. Gradually, this&#xD;
      extra pressure wears away the smooth cartilage, resulting in osteoarthritis on that side of&#xD;
      the knee joint. This problem is particularly common in young athletes and places them at risk&#xD;
      of early osteoarthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An operation exists whereby one of the bones either side of the knee is cut ( an osteotomy)&#xD;
      and hinged open to straighten the leg. This alteration redistributes body-weight more equally&#xD;
      across the knee joint and is known to be effective in delaying and possibly preventing, the&#xD;
      progression of knee osteoarthritis- especially in younger and physically more active patients&#xD;
      in whom a knee replacement is undesirable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently it is possible to ( accurately) calculate the precise position of the bone cut and&#xD;
      number of degrees correction required to straighten a leg using digital x-rays and&#xD;
      three-dimensional CT scans. However there is no method of implementing this pre-operative&#xD;
      plan during surgery so that the majority of surgeons rely on relatively crude and ipso facto&#xD;
      unreliable intra-operative measurements as a guide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To improve the accuracy of this operation, the investigator propose the use of a custom-made&#xD;
      'cutting block', tailored for each individual patient and its shape will match the contour of&#xD;
      the patient's bone to ensure it can only be placed in one position. Pre-cut slots and holes&#xD;
      will then guide the saw cut and the number of degrees the bone in hinged open, as per the&#xD;
      pre-operative plan; it functions as an intra-operative template for the surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will primarily examine whether there is a close match between the planned and&#xD;
      actual correction of leg deformities when using a patient-matched cutting-block.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Malalignment of the leg is known to play a significant role in the development of knee&#xD;
      arthrosis. Osteotomy can be used to correct angular deformities around the knee. A number of&#xD;
      studies have found that the success of this procedure in delaying the progression of knee&#xD;
      arthrosis is highly dependent on an accurate of deformity correction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is possible to produce a precise pre-operative surgical plan of the osteotomy required for&#xD;
      a favourable outcome. However, the majority of surgeons still rely upon relatively crude and&#xD;
      ipso facto unreliable intra-operative measurements to guide the actual operation. This is&#xD;
      reflected in studies comparing the pre-operative plan with final outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So to facilitate accurate translation of pre-operative osteotomy planning to intra-operative&#xD;
      execution, the investigator proposes to transfer two technologies that are already&#xD;
      commercially available in arthroplasty into the filed of corrective osteotomy i.e. 3D&#xD;
      planning and custom-made patient-matched cutting blocks. This will permit translation of the&#xD;
      surgeon's pre-order to ensure precise intra-operative positioning. Once secured slots and&#xD;
      holes in the cutting block will ensure that the bony cut and angular correction is performed,&#xD;
      and secured with a plate and screws, in the precise location determined by the pre-operative&#xD;
      plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective multi centre study is proposed, primarily to confirm the efficacy of use, and&#xD;
      accuracy of deformity correction around the knee using patient-matched cutting blocks.&#xD;
      Accuracy will be assessed by comparing post-operative alignment (measured on plan radiographs&#xD;
      and CT scan) with the pre-operative surgical plan. Patient questionnaires to assess outcome&#xD;
      will also be collected, and optional gait analysis performed.&#xD;
