      The Nucleus 24 Auditory Brainstem Implant (ABI) is the only FDA approved device for&#xD;
      restoration of meaningful hearing in Neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF2) patients. This device has&#xD;
      been discontinued, meaning that there is no commercially approved device currently available.&#xD;
      The replacement model, the ABI541 (an unapproved device), is being investigated in ongoing&#xD;
      clinical trials. A compassionate use arm of a clinical trial allows patients with NF2 to be&#xD;
      implanted with this new ABI.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, the Nucleus 24 (ABI24M) Auditory Brainstem Implant (ABI) is approved for use in&#xD;
      individuals 12 years of age or older who have been diagnosed with Neurofibromatosis Type 2&#xD;
      (NF2). Implantation may occur during first or second side tumor removal or in patients with&#xD;
      previously removed vestibular schwannomas bilaterally. As the ABI24M is now obsolete, there&#xD;
      is currently no commercially approved device available to restore useful hearing in patients.&#xD;
      While the manufacturer of the device is pursuing commercial approval of the ABI541, it is&#xD;
      anticipated that it may be several months or years before final approval. However, it is&#xD;
      preferable to place the device at the time of tumor removal while the patient has an open&#xD;
      craniotomy site, thereby avoiding a second surgery and its associated risks solely for the&#xD;
      purpose device implantation. In addition, placement of an ABI at the time of tumor removal&#xD;
      optimizes auditory rehabilitation, providing critical auditory sensations that may more&#xD;
      effectively maintain auditory pathways. The FDA approved a compassionate use arm for an&#xD;
      ongoing clinical trial to permit implantation of the ABI541 in up to 10 NF2 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo pre-operative evaluation for ABI surgery. Those who are appropriate for&#xD;
      surgery will undergo a procedure for implantation of the ABI541. As per manufacturer&#xD;
      protocol, the parameters of the ABI541 including adjustment of electrode sensitivities and&#xD;
      activation of specific electrodes will be completed at each follow-up visit post-operatively.&#xD;
      This process involves adjustment of device parameters by a trained audiologist who&#xD;
      subsequently administers audiologic tests to confirm optimal activation of the ABI541.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All audiologic testing and assessments represent the standard of care. These post-operative&#xD;
      follow-up appointments will occur at 4-12 weeks, three, six, and twelve months, and&#xD;
      biannually thereafter. Timing of these appointments may vary by as much as four weeks prior&#xD;
      to or after the planned follow-up date (e.g. between 2-4 months for the 3 month follow-up).&#xD;
      Unscheduled visits will be taken in the Otology clinic as needed to address any concerns&#xD;
      patients may have regarding the use of their Nucleus ABI541.&#xD;
