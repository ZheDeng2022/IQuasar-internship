  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      National clinical trials, phase III, randomized, open, parallel, study of superiority, in&#xD;
      which three hundred thirty-six (336) participants of both sexes, aged between 18 and 65 years&#xD;
      will be randomly allocated to one of two treatment groups. The Group 01 will use Cefalium®&#xD;
      and group 02 will use Tylenol®.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cefalium® is a combination of Caffeine + Paracetamol + dihydroergotamine mesylate +&#xD;
      metoclopramide hydrochloride. The dihydroergotamine mesylate interacts with the serotonergic,&#xD;
      dopaminergic and noradrenergic receptors, but it's mechanism is not totally known. The&#xD;
      caffeine presents mechanisms that are not totally clear, but it may relieves the pain by&#xD;
      activating of the central noradenosine pathway (pain suppressing system). The Metoclopramide&#xD;
      hydrochloride presents an anti-emetic action and prokinetic action in the gastrointestinal&#xD;
      tract.One of its properties is the inhibition of nausea and vomiting triggered by drugs such&#xD;
      as ergotamine.Paracetamol, also called acetaminophen is an effective agent analgesic and&#xD;
      antipyretic with weak anti-inflammatory activity.&#xD;
