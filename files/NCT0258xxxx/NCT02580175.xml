  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The abortion considers the most common cause of fetal demise all over the world. The majority&#xD;
      of cases occur in the first trimester.The termination of abortion may be by medical or&#xD;
      surgical methods, however; the surgical methods represents the greater part of termination.&#xD;
      Therefore, the safety of this procedure is a worldwide public health concern . Many clinical&#xD;
      studies have been reported the safety of surgical evacuation in the first trimester.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The suction-aspiration or vacuum aspiration are the most common surgical methods of induced&#xD;
      abortion. This consists of removing the fetus, embryo, placenta, and membranes by suction&#xD;
      using a manual syringe or electric pump. However; these technique always need cervical&#xD;
      dilation before aspiration. The menstrual extraction does not require cervical dilation and&#xD;
      can be used in very early pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgical evacuation is generally considered safe, however; short-term complications are&#xD;
      reported due to need of dilatation of the cervix and incomplete evacuation because the&#xD;
      surgeon is the only one who can decide the end of the operation depending on his subjective&#xD;
      sense.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However; with continuous ultrasound guidance, the process could be almost complete because&#xD;
      the ultrasound can accurately identify the direction and size of the uterus, position of the&#xD;
      gestational sac, observe the insertion of surgical instruments and the advancement of the&#xD;
      operation especially when the configuration of the uterus is distorted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present; ultrasonography is not considered to be an essential pre-requisite for abortion&#xD;
      in all cases so our study aims to detect if complete evacuation can be achieved by&#xD;
      ultrasonographic assistance or not. We also tried in this study to compare the operative&#xD;
      time, amount of blood loss and the occurrence of accidental uterine perforation during the&#xD;
      procedure with and without use of ultrasound.&#xD;
