    <textblock>
      Lately, many researchers have found that Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are&#xD;
      most likely to have gross motor deficiencies such as lack of coordination in gait and&#xD;
      balance. Much has been researched on etiology and motor learning, but only very few&#xD;
      researches have examined and analyzed quantitatively gait and balance in ASD. The aim of this&#xD;
      research is to analyze quantitatively balance, gait and balance during perturbation in&#xD;
      children with ASD and to compare with typically developed children (TD). A group of 20&#xD;
      children diagnosed with ASD and a control group of 20 TD children will be recruited and&#xD;
      tested in the laboratory with well-established measures of gait and balance function. They&#xD;
      will be instructed to stand as still as possible on a force plate with different task&#xD;
      conditions : (1) standing with the eyes open (EO) - standing upright viewing an &quot;X&quot; displayed&#xD;
      on a screen 3 meters in front of them; (2) eyes closed (EC) - same as (1) with the eyes&#xD;
      closed and covered by blindfolds (i.e. no visual information). (3) Same as 1 standing on foam&#xD;
      (i.e., conflicting proprioceptive information). Gait will be measured using the narrow base&#xD;
      walk test, modified for clinical use. Participants will be asked to walk within a narrow path&#xD;
      6 meters long . The statistical analysis will include Independent T-tests to compare the ASD&#xD;
      and controls with respect to different characteristics. General Linear Model (GLM) will be&#xD;
      used by applying a separate model where the dependent variables will be the average values of&#xD;
      the postural stability or gait stability parameters (continuous) and the independent&#xD;
      variables were categorical by the group and task condition.&#xD;

      Study protocol The study group will be consisted of 30 ASD children (6-12 years old) who were&#xD;
      diagnosed with ASD recruited in the Pediatric Neurology clinic at Soroka Medical Center,&#xD;
      Beer-Sheva, Israel, and ASD centers. A convenience sample of 30 age-gender matched healthy&#xD;
      control children (6-12 years old) will be recruited using ads and flayer in Beer-Sheva and&#xD;
      area. Children's parents will sign the informed consent, in accordance with procedures&#xD;
      approved by the Helsinki Ethics Committee in Soroka Medical Center. As part of the initial&#xD;
      assessment all children including the control group subjects will undergo a complete&#xD;
      neuro-developmental and motor screening evaluation by an experienced pediatric neurologist&#xD;
      using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) diagnostic criteria&#xD;
      Children with autism have to meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,&#xD;
      Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria. ASD participants will have to communicate enough in order&#xD;
      to cooperate and understand orders. Exclusion criteria are: ASD children who were diagnosed&#xD;
      with neurological, orthopedic, or psychiatric diagnoses according to DSM-IV criteria that can&#xD;
      affect motor control and postural stability; cerebral palsy; neuropathic diseases; limb&#xD;
      fracture; head trauma during the previous year; use of any medication other than MPH during&#xD;
      the study period; and who had an IQ score below the normal range (&lt;70), as assessed by the&#xD;
      Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children - Revised (Wisc-R) administered by a child&#xD;
      psychologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment procedure ASD participants will be recruited in the children neurology department&#xD;
      at Soroka Medical center. Control group subjects will be recruited from the community using&#xD;
      personal contacts using ads and flayer. The PI of this project (Prof. Zamir) will not be&#xD;
      involved in the recruitment procedure of the children's under his clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Assessments: Postural stability Protocol The assessment procedure will be made in the&#xD;
      ediatric Neurology clinic at Soroka Medical Center, Beer-Sheva, the parents will sign of the&#xD;
      informed consent than the participant will be instructed to stand upright as still as&#xD;
      possible on the force platform with the feet positioned as close as possible (heels and toes&#xD;
      touching). A total of five 30-second quiet-standing trials will be obtained from each&#xD;
      participant instructed to stand as still as they possibly can in two task conditions. Two&#xD;
      minute rest break will be provided between two task conditions and thirty seconds rest breaks&#xD;
      between the trials. The two task conditions are: (1) standing with the eyes open (EO) -&#xD;
      standing upright viewing an &quot;X&quot; displayed on a screen 3 meters in front of them; (2) eyes&#xD;
      closed (EC) - same as (1) with the eyes closed and covered by blindfolds (i.e. no visual&#xD;
      information). (3) Same as 1 standing on foam (i.e., conflicting proprioceptive information).&#xD;
      Balance measurements will be collected with a Kistler 9287 single force platform (Kistler&#xD;
      Instrument Corp., Winterthur, Switzerland) that measures the time-varying displacement of the&#xD;
      Center of pressure (CoP). The force platform data will be sampled at a frequency of 100 Hz&#xD;
      and stored on a hard disk for later processing. Four well-established parameters of postural&#xD;
      stability will be extracted using automatic code written in Matlab (Math Works Inc.,&#xD;
      Cambridge, MA, USA): 1) Mediolateral CoP range (mm) (ML-sway Range); 2) Anterioposterior CoP&#xD;
      range (mm) (AP-sway Range); 3) Mean velocity of CoP sway (mm/sec); 4) Sway area (mm2) - the&#xD;
      elliptical area of the CoP points. Lower postural stability scores indicate higher levels of&#xD;
      postural control. Also four parameters of SDA were extracted using automatic code written in&#xD;
      Matlab: 1) short-term diffusion coefficients in mm2s-1 (Drs); 2) long-term diffusion&#xD;
      coefficients in mm2s-1 (Drl); 3) the Critical Time in sec (Ctr); and 4) Critical Displacement&#xD;
      in cm (Cdr). These parameters will be computed for each subject's trials, and then averaged&#xD;
      for each set of 5 trials to obtain an average value for each parameter and for each subject,&#xD;
      in each experimental condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gait stability protocol After a 10-minute break, gait will be measured using the narrow base&#xD;
      walk test, modified for clinical use. Participants will be asked to walk within a narrow path&#xD;
      (6 meters long) first without and then with a concurrent cognitive task (ST- and DT), always&#xD;
      in the same order. The test incorporates measurement of lateral instability during gait. The&#xD;
      width of the narrow path will be normalized to 50% of the distance between the participant's&#xD;
      anterior superior iliac spines + the width of the subject's shoe. This produces a similar&#xD;
      challenge for individuals with different body morphologies. The narrow path will be outlined&#xD;
      by two narrow six meter black mattresses on the walking surface; the participants will be&#xD;
      instructed to walk within the path without stepping on the black mattresses. All trials will&#xD;
      be videotaped using a video-camera that was placed 2 meters in front of the walking path and&#xD;
      1.5 meters high to detect trial time and step errors during the test. Step error is defined&#xD;
      as every step where the subject's shoes step outside the narrow path, touching the black&#xD;
      mattresses outlining the sides of the narrow base walkway. test-re-test agreement of NBWT&#xD;
      found to be high for all variables; ICC(1,2) 0.77-0.92 in ST and 0.78-0.92 in DT (unpublished&#xD;
      data).&#xD;
