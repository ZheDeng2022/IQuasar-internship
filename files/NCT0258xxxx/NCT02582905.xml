  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preclinical and clinical data as well as mechanistic justification have been presented&#xD;
      suggesting citicoline and pregnenolone are each promising treatments for alcohol use in BPD.&#xD;
      Both appear to have favorable side effect profiles and no known drug-drug interactions. Thus,&#xD;
      they have the potential to be safely used in a dual diagnosis population already taking other&#xD;
      medications. A 12-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled adaptive&#xD;
      design study of citicoline and pregnenolone is proposed in 199 persons with alcohol use&#xD;
      disorder and bipolar I or II disorder or schizoaffective disorder (bipolar type). The primary&#xD;
      aim will be to assess change in alcohol use. Biomarkers of alcohol use, alcohol craving, mood&#xD;
      and cognition will also be assessed. Relationships between neurosteroid and choline levels&#xD;
      and the outcome measures will be explored.&#xD;

      A 12-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled adaptive, Drop The&#xD;
      Loser (DTL) design clinical trial of citicoline and pregnenolone will be conducted in 199&#xD;
      outpatients with bipolar I or II disorder or schizoaffective disorder (bipolar type) and&#xD;
      current alcohol use disorder. Potential participants will be identified and an appointment&#xD;
      will be arranged. At this appointment, informed consent will be obtained, and assessment&#xD;
      procedures, including a review of inclusion and exclusion criteria, will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A structured clinical interview for Diagnostic Statistical Manual (DSM-5), Structured&#xD;
      Clinical Interview for Disorders (SCID) will be performed to establish the diagnoses of&#xD;
      bipolar I or II disorder and alcohol use disorder. Recent alcohol use (and, if present, other&#xD;
      substance use) will be assessed using the Timeline Followback (TLFB) method. Drinking&#xD;
      severity and withdrawal symptoms will be assessed through a variety of measures (e.g.,&#xD;
      Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment of Alcohol Use-Revised (CIWA-Ar), Penn Alcohol&#xD;
      Craving Scale (PACS), Short Index of Problems (SIP)). Length of problem alcohol use will be&#xD;
      assessed by asking &quot;When did alcohol first start causing you problems?&quot; Blood will be drawn&#xD;
      for laboratory analyses including a complete blood count (CBC) and Comprehensive Metabolic&#xD;
      Panel (includes a liver panel with AST, ALT as well as lipids and electrolytes), and GGT and&#xD;
      carbohydrate-deficient transferrin (CDT) will be added at baseline (week 0) and weeks 6 and&#xD;
      12. Cognition, including the domains of memory, decision making, impulsivity, attention, and&#xD;
      executive functioning will also be assessed at baseline and week 12 using the World Health&#xD;
      Organization/University of California at Los Angeles Auditory-Verbal Learning Test (WHO-UCLA&#xD;
      AVLT), Trail Making Test (TMT), and the Golden Stroop Color Word Test. Women of childbearing&#xD;
      potential will receive a urine pregnancy test at baseline, week 6, and week 12 and will be&#xD;
      counseled about effective contraceptive methods. A psychiatrist (PI or Co-I) will assess&#xD;
      participants at baseline and weekly follow-up visits and will participate in the informed&#xD;
      consent process. The active medication or placebo capsules will be initiated at baseline and&#xD;
      increased weekly in weeks 1, 2 and 3 to achieve the target doses for citicoline (2000 mg/day)&#xD;
      or pregnenolone (500 mg/day). Side effects will be managed in a blinded fashion. Safety and&#xD;
      side effects will be assessed with the Systematic Assessment for Treatment Emergent Events&#xD;
      (SAFTEE). At weekly visits, mood and suicidality will be assessed through various measures&#xD;
      (e.g. Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD17), Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale&#xD;
      (CSSRS) and assessment of alcohol use will again be evaluated. All participants will receive&#xD;
      Medical Monitoring (MM) as a psychosocial platform. After study completion, participants will&#xD;
      be provided standard psychiatric care until outside referral is arranged.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  English or Spanish speaking&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current diagnosis of alcohol use disorder with at least moderate severity (DSM-5&#xD;
             terminology)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Alcohol use of at least an average of 28 drinks a week if male or an average of 21&#xD;
             drinks per week if female and an average of 3 drinking days a week in the 28 days&#xD;
             prior to intake&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current mood stabilizer therapy (defined as lithium, lamotrigine, carbamazepine,&#xD;
             oxcarbazepine or an atypical antipsychotic) with stable dose for ≥ 28 days prior to&#xD;
             randomization or valproate/divalproex at a stable dose for ≥ 90 days (longer period&#xD;
             due to data suggesting valproate may decrease alcohol use in BPD)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of substance use disorder other than alcohol, caffeine or nicotine is&#xD;
             allowed if 1) alcohol is the self-identified substance of choice and 2) severity of&#xD;
             other substance use disorder is ≤ moderate&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Mood disorders other than bipolar I or II disorders or schizoaffective disorder&#xD;
             bipolar type (e.g. bipolar NOS, cyclothymic disorders, schizophrenia, schizoaffective&#xD;
             disorder depressive type, or unipolar depression based on the SCID); other disorders&#xD;
             (e.g. anxiety, will be allowed)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Baseline HRSD17 or YMRS scores ≥ 35 to exclude those with very severe mood symptoms at&#xD;
             baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of clinically significant alcohol withdrawal symptoms defined as a CIWA-Ar&#xD;
             score of ≥ 10&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current (last 28 days) treatment with naltrexone, acamprosate, disulfiram, or&#xD;
             topiramate as these may also decrease alcohol use&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Oral contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy. This exclusion is due to a&#xD;
             possible interaction with pregnenolone.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women with hormone sensitive conditions such as breast cancer, uterine cancer, ovarian&#xD;
             cancer, endometriosis, uterine fibroids. These persons are excluded because&#xD;
             pregnenolone is converted to estrogens.&#xD;

             attention, any attempt in the past 3 months or current suicidal ideation with plan and&#xD;
             intent such that outpatient care is precluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Intensive outpatient treatment (defined as ≥3 visits each week) for substance abuse&#xD;
             (AA, NA meetings, or less intensive counseling at baseline will be allowed)&#xD;
