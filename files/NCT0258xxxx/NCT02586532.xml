      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) can cause the cancer nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Early detection&#xD;
      of NPC through screening can lead to better treatment outcomes than when it is found later.&#xD;
      Currently, NPC is found through visual inspection with an endoscope. It is not clear how well&#xD;
      this method works, especially for the identification of small, early cancers. Researchers&#xD;
      want to see how well nasal endoscopy works to detect NPC compared to another method called&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the sensitivity of endoscopy to detect prevalent NPC among people who screen&#xD;
      positive for EBV antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants of the NPC Early Detection Screening Program in China who:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Have increased levels of EBV antibodies&#xD;
&#xD;
      Are otherwise in good health and able to have an MRI procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a blood test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a nasal endoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have an MRI of the head and neck:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have lesions identified by either the endoscopy or MRI biopsied and sent to&#xD;
      a pathologist for review and diagnosis of NPC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will compare NPC detection rates by endoscopy and by MRI to see which method is&#xD;
      better able to identify prevalent NPC.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a necessary cause of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Individuals&#xD;
      who develop NPC have been shown to have an altered EBV antibody profile. Ongoing efforts to&#xD;
      evaluate EBV antibody testing as a screening test for the early detection of NPC have been&#xD;
      launched in China and Taiwan but it is unclear whether the current method to detect NPC among&#xD;
      screen-positive individuals (i.e., visual inspection with the aide of an endoscope) is&#xD;
      sufficiently sensitive to detect prevalent cancers among screen positive individuals. In the&#xD;
      present study, we aim to evaluate the sensitivity of endoscopy to detect NPC. The study is&#xD;
      embedded within a large, community-based trial in China to evaluate EBV antibody testing as a&#xD;
      screening test that triages individuals into endoscopy for the early detection of NPC. We&#xD;
      plan to enroll 1,000 individuals with elevated EBV antibody scores within the active&#xD;
      screening arm of the trial in China. Participants will have both endoscopy and MRI performed&#xD;
      to detect nasopharyngeal lesions. Lesions identified by either method will be biopsied and&#xD;
      evaluated for the presence of NPC. NPC cases will also be identified by linkage to the&#xD;
      regional cancer registry. We expect to identify a total of 25 histologically confirmed NPC&#xD;
      cases through endoscopy, MRI and/or registry linkage. The sensitivity of endoscopy to detect&#xD;
      prevalent NPC will be estimated. Characteristics of prevalent NPC cases detected by MRI or&#xD;
      registry linkage but missed by endoscopy will be described, with respect to clinical stage,&#xD;
      socio-demographic and other characteristics. This study is an important complement to the&#xD;
      ongoing screening trial in China, as a highly sensitive EBV-based screening test can&#xD;
      ultimately be successful only if methods available to identify cancer among screen-positive&#xD;
      individuals are equally sensitive. Demonstration of high sensitivity of endoscopy to detect&#xD;
      NPC will be reassuring. Demonstration of reduced sensitivity will trigger the need to&#xD;
      consider alternatives to endoscopy for the diagnosis of NPC.&#xD;
