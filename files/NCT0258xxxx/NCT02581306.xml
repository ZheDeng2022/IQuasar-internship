      If eligible to participate in the research study after completing the physical screening&#xD;
      procedures, participants will be asked to return to the Substrate Metabolism Laboratory on&#xD;
      another occasion after a short fast (no food or beverages - besides water) for at least 6&#xD;
      hours. After participants arrive, participants will rest quietly for approximately 30 min.&#xD;
      The investigators will then collect a blood sample from a vein in participants hand, or&#xD;
      forearm. After obtaining a baseline blood sample, participants will exercise at a moderate&#xD;
      intensity (on a treadmill or a stationary bike) for one hour. This one hour moderate exercise&#xD;
      session will feel like a slow jog during which participants would be able to carry a&#xD;
      conversation. In order for the investigators to measure energy expended and the amount of fat&#xD;
      participants are burning during exercise, the investigators will periodically ask&#xD;
      participants to breathe through a mouthpiece so the investigators can collect participants&#xD;
      expired breath. After the exercise session the investigators will collect another blood&#xD;
      sample from a vein in participants hand, or forearm.&#xD;

      General study design&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects who exercise regularly will be instructed to exercise exactly 3 days before the&#xD;
           experimental trial, and then abstain from their exercise training program until after&#xD;
           the experiment is complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will arrive to the Substrate Metabolism Laboratory (1210 CCRB) after at least a&#xD;
           6h fast.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After resting quietly in the laboratory for approximately 30min, Dr. Horowitz will&#xD;
           collect a resting blood sample by venipuncture, as he has done in our other IRB approved&#xD;
           protocols (e.g., HUM00029179). Briefly, Dr. Horowitz will wash his hands and put on&#xD;
           gloves. The participant's skin will be disinfected at the venipuncture site with&#xD;
           isopropyl alcohol. Single-use needles will be used for each participant and immediately&#xD;
           discarded into a biohazard sharps container after use. After the blood draw, direct&#xD;
           pressure will be applied to the site of needle insertion to avoid/reduce bruising and&#xD;
           discomfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will exercise (bike or treadmill) for 1h at a moderate exercise intensity&#xD;
           (approximately 65% of their predicted VO2peak). This moderate exercise intensity has&#xD;
           been used extensively by Dr. Horowitz's laboratory in previous exercise testing and&#xD;
           training studies in both lean and obese individuals, and is well tolerated by both&#xD;
           populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  During the exercise session, subjects will wear a heart rate monitor to ensure&#xD;
                participants are exercising at the correct exercise intensity.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Subjects will also use the mouthpiece and nose clip (described above) for ~5min at&#xD;
                the beginning, middle, and end of exercise to verify they are exercising at&#xD;
                approximately 65% of their predicted VO2peak.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A study team member will be present with the participant at all times during&#xD;
                exercise to ensure the comfort and safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Immediately after exercise another blood sample will be collected.&#xD;
