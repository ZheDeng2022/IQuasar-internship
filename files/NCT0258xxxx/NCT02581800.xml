      Background: Premature infants and their patents are discharged earlier from hospital and sent&#xD;
      home in early in-homecare programs. Research regarding the use of health IT is needed to say,&#xD;
      whether the use of videoconference and Smartphone application is a viable option to address&#xD;
      the parents need for support in relations to early discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: Test and explore early in-homecare (PreHomeCare) with videoconference and mobile&#xD;
      application versus hospital consultations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: Main study; a randomized controlled intervention study with the hypothesis; parent of&#xD;
      premature infants who have access to electronic knowledge and participatory guidance 24-7:&#xD;
      increases proportion of exclusive breastfeeding, Improves parent/infant interaction, enhances&#xD;
      confidence and increases knowledge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub study 1; a field study. Sub study 2; an interview study. Perspectives: It is expected&#xD;
      that this project will be an argument in development of care for premature infants and&#xD;
      telemedicine use in the future&#xD;

      Effect and experience of PreHomeCare of preterm infants using telecommunication and&#xD;
      Smartphone application: A randomized intervention study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Premature infants and their patents are discharged earlier from hospital and sent home in&#xD;
      early in-homecare programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effect studies of early in-homecare point towards that premature infants have lower risk of&#xD;
      infections under the period of tube feeding, higher parental satisfaction and indicate that&#xD;
      early in-homecare of premature infants benefit of home visits with fewer readmissions and&#xD;
      less unscheduled support, shorter length of hospital stay and longer provision of breast&#xD;
      milk. Standard procedure in early in-homecare is home visits but in regions of Denmark with&#xD;
      large distances to the parent/infant this is not possible. No studies have until now offered&#xD;
      24-7 hours home visit support. Further research regarding the use of health IT is needed to&#xD;
      say, whether the use of videoconference (participatory guidance) and Smartphone application&#xD;
      (knowledge and data registration) is a viable option to address the parents need for support&#xD;
      in relations to early discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Study: A randomized controlled intervention study. The aim is to test the effect of the&#xD;
      use of video communication and mobile application on exclusive breastfeeding, parent/infant&#xD;
      interaction and parental confidence with the premature infants after PreHomeCare.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis; Compared to parents of premature infants who receive hospital consultations, the&#xD;
      parents of premature infants who have access to electronic knowledge and participatory&#xD;
      guidance 24-7:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Increases proportion of exclusive breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Improves parent/infant interaction (MABISC-mother and baby interaction scale).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Enhances the families' feeling of confidence in caring for their infant (KPCS - Karitane&#xD;
           parenting confidence scale).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Increases parent's knowledge with regarding the premature infant and the care. Parents&#xD;
           will be randomized to either intervention or control group via simple randomization&#xD;
           procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention group will receive a mobile application and videoconference system. The&#xD;
      application contains three parts; 1) knowledge, 2) video contact/participatory guidance and&#xD;
      3) data registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size: Applying a significance level of 5%, a two-sided two-sample proportions test&#xD;
      revealed that a sample size of 39 in each group maintains a power of 80% to detect the&#xD;
      difference consisting of 55% vs. 40% breastfeeding women in the two groups after 4 weeks&#xD;
      conditional on 66% breastfeeding at discharge. This corresponds to a sample size of 65 at&#xD;
      randomisation. To compensate for the design effect ICC(0.01) the total sample size needed is&#xD;
      thus approximately 160 preterm infants, 80 in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: Infants who fulfil criteria for early in-home care. GA &gt; 34+0, No need&#xD;
      for monitoring, tube feeding and started breastfeeding/bottle feeding, Danish speaking or&#xD;
      English speaking patents (but understand the Danish text in the application).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: Infants who do not fulfil criteria for early in-home care and parents,&#xD;
      who require extra observations of the parent-infant relationship.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis; the results of the intervention and control group will be compared and&#xD;
      analysed following &quot;intention to treat&quot; principle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub study 1: A field observational study: The aim is describe what characterizes nursing&#xD;
      practice in PreHomeCare from the parents' angle in home around video consultations. Method&#xD;
      will be based on Spradley &quot;participant observation&quot;. The focus for the observation is the&#xD;
      nurses' communication, how is her act on the screen etc. The field observations are expected&#xD;
      to enlighten the characteristics of the nursing practice with a systematic description of&#xD;
      PreHomeCare setting using video consultations. The prose text will be analysed following&#xD;
      Ricoeur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub study 2: An interview study: The aim is to explore how parents of premature infants&#xD;
      experience PreHomeCare with use of video communication and mobile application. The study will&#xD;
      be planned and conducted with inspiration from Kvale and Brinkmann´s instructions. The main&#xD;
      focus for the interview will be to uncover the main question: &quot;How did you experience&#xD;
      PreHomeCare?&quot; with a particular focus on what have been especially meaningful for the parents&#xD;
      under PreHomeCare. The verbatim transcribed material will be analysed following Ricoeur&#xD;
      interpretations theory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspectives: This study will access new knowledge on the effect and experience with&#xD;
      PreHomeCare. It will give insight in what is needed to make clear goals for the quality of&#xD;
      the treatment and care for premature infants and parents in the last part of the&#xD;
      admission/PreHomeCare. It is expected that this project will be an argument in further&#xD;
      development of care for premature infants and telemedicine use in the future. The increased&#xD;
      effectiveness can address challenges and help relocate economic and professional health&#xD;
      services.&#xD;

    <description>The intervention group will receive the Smartphone application at inclusion time and learn to use it in the hos-pital. When the families go home they will use the application and receive planned video consultations 2-3 times a week and the possibility to call the neonatal ward 24 hours a day all week whenever needed, until the infant gets full nutrition from the breast or bottle and gains weight. Parents will borrow a baby weight to weigh the baby at home.</description>
