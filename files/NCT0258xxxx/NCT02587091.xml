      A cluster randomized trial was conducted across eight rural sub-counties in southwestern&#xD;
      Uganda. This study was conducted to determine the impact of advertising free obstetric&#xD;
      ultrasound on the attendance to antenatal care clinics.&#xD;

      Study Design We conducted a non-blinded cluster-randomized controlled trial to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of advertising prenatal portable obstetric ultrasound (pOBU) on uptake of&#xD;
      antenatal care (ANC) services. This study design was selected to mitigate confounding&#xD;
      variables and use the natural landscape of the region (described below), which is&#xD;
      conveniently divided into geographically isolated but otherwise homogenous sub-counties, to&#xD;
      our advantage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was conducted in Kabale District, a rural highland located in southwestern Uganda.&#xD;
      It is roughly 560 km from the capital city of Kampala and has a population of approximately&#xD;
      522,000. It is divided into three regions - north, central and south, and is further&#xD;
      subdivided into 22 sub-counties, with 11 in the North, four centrally and seven in the South.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics approval was obtained from Lakeridge Health Corporation in the city of Oshawa, Canada&#xD;
      as well as Mbarara University of Science and Technology (MUST) in Mbarara, Uganda. The study&#xD;
      protocol can be found at the following link:&#xD;
&#xD;
      http://bridgetohealth.ca/study-protocol/&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population All sub-counties of southern and northern regions of Kabale district were&#xD;
      eligible for inclusion as a cluster in this study. This population predominantly engages in&#xD;
      subsistence agriculture. There is very limited data describing the healthcare of this rural&#xD;
      and isolated region, and it is believed that government statistics are often inaccurate. The&#xD;
      Ugandan Ministry of Health, numerous non governmental organizations (NGOs) and other&#xD;
      faith-based organizations provide for the regions' healthcare. Data suggests that uptake of&#xD;
      any ANC services is close to 66%, with only one third of these women returning for a fourth&#xD;
      visit or delivering in a healthcare facility (HCF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All women who were currently aware of being pregnant and presented to ANC were eligible for&#xD;
      inclusion into the study. No pregnant woman who presented to clinic was excluded from the&#xD;
      study. All patients provided written informed consent on a form developed in collaboration&#xD;
      with the MUST ethics board. Many patients were illiterate or unable to read the consent form&#xD;
      as it was written in English. A bilingual Ugandan midwife, translated the consent form and&#xD;
      verbally explained its contents for each patient as they were checked into the clinic. It was&#xD;
      clearly stated that any patient who chose to not engage in the research study would still&#xD;
      receive full ANC care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation and Masking Twenty-two sub-counties were assessed for inclusion, of these 18&#xD;
      were randomised to the intervention (n=4) or control group (n=4). The four sub-counties in&#xD;
      the central region were intentionally excluded from the study design because they are&#xD;
      primarily composed of urban and sub-urban communities and effectively divide the northern and&#xD;
      southern regions. Four control sites (sub-counties) were randomly selected from the southern&#xD;
      wing and four intervention sites were randomly selected from the northern wing. Selection of&#xD;
      northern versus southern counties for intervention or control groups, as well as selection of&#xD;
      which subcounties within each region and in which order they would be visited was all&#xD;
      selected at random. Random selection was conducted by the statisticians at MUST using a&#xD;
      simple random number program in MS-Excel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All eight sub-counties in the control and treatment arm received advertisement by word of&#xD;
      mouth (WOM) regarding ANC. The control arm received no advertisement of pOBU. When consent&#xD;
      was obtained in the control arm there was intentional masking of pOBU. Following completion&#xD;
      of initial consent and an entrance survey all women were provided with a debriefing form&#xD;
      explaining the presence of ultrasound, including communities where it had not been&#xD;
      advertised, and again consent was obtained to participate in the research study. Any women&#xD;
      who chose to not engage in the research study were provided with complete ANC services,&#xD;
      including pOBU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Communities were randomly selected as stated above to receive messaging of pOBU. However, the&#xD;
      control communities were chosen to be visited en bloc in the first four days, as opposed to&#xD;
      alternating control then intervention on each day. This was done specifically to avoid&#xD;
      contamination with radio messaging of pOBU, which was felt to possibly cross geographic&#xD;
      boundaries. Sunday was intentionally avoided as a study day as most patients in the&#xD;
      population ascribe to the Catholic faith and would not attend any clinics if held on that&#xD;
      particular day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention The intervention itself was advertising the availability of clinic and pOBU at&#xD;
      the cluster level (sub-county). The initial study design had only two groups as described&#xD;
      above in randomisation. However, the protocol was amended during the study due to interim&#xD;
      analysis results demonstrating WOM advertising of pOBU was not successful in increasing&#xD;
      uptake of ANC. It was hypothesized that the population was unable to spread this message as&#xD;
      many did not know what pOBU was, and therefore could not relay the message. The intervention&#xD;
      arm was subsequently modified to include radio advertising so that the message could be&#xD;
      delivered more clearly and directly. This resulted in the following three distinct&#xD;
      intervention groups: WOM advertisement of both pOBU and ANC (Intervention A), WOM&#xD;
      advertisement of pOBU and WOM + radio advertisement of ANC (Intervention B), and WOM + radio&#xD;
      advertisement of both pOBU and ANC (Intervention C). The radio message in Intervention C&#xD;
      included the words &quot;You will be able to see a picture of your baby&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All women attending clinic were offered pOBU delivered by a certified Ugandan ultrasound&#xD;
      technician using single Nanomaxx unit with a C60n/8-5 MHz (11-mm broadband curved array)&#xD;
      probe. Patients rotated through an ANC clinic that was based on the WHO guidelines for high&#xD;
      quality ANC5 as well as the WHO four-pronged approach of elimination of mother to child&#xD;
      transmission of HIV (EMTCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women received pre- and post-test counseling and rapid testing for HIV. Those who were&#xD;
      positive were enrolled into the National HIV program and started on antiretroviral therapy as&#xD;
      per national guidelines. Women were also offered intermittent presumptive therapy for&#xD;
      malaria, rapid treponemal testing and treatment for syphilis, hepatitis B screening and&#xD;
      syndromic management of sexually transmitted infections. Iron and folate supplementation was&#xD;
      provided to all women. Any woman in active labour or with a critically low hemoglobin was&#xD;
      transported to hospital by ambulance. Any woman with abnormal findings on ultrasound was&#xD;
      referred for obstetric specialty follow up. All women were encouraged to deliver at a local&#xD;
      HCF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survey Women were questioned regarding their experiences and attitudes towards ANC and&#xD;
      intentions to utilize a HFC both on entrance (before being debriefed regarding the&#xD;
      availability of ultrasound) and after receiving the pOBU results. This was performed with the&#xD;
      assistance of a bilingual Ugandan midwife. Data was collected using standardized electronic&#xD;
      patient entrance surveys. The forms captured patient demographic and socioeconomic data.&#xD;
      Patients were also asked if they were aware of the availability of ultrasound prior to&#xD;
      arrival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes The primary study outcome was the rate ratio (RR) of total ANC clinic attendance&#xD;
      between the intervention groups and control group. Secondary outcomes included A) the RR of&#xD;
      attendance by women who had previously used a TBA, B) the RR of attendance by women who had&#xD;
      not yet attended ANC, and C) the RR of total attendance between the three interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Sub-counties were chosen as the unit of allocation and number of women&#xD;
      accessing ANC in each sub-county as the unit of analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size calculation performed a priori was not utilized for this study as the design&#xD;
      changed during implementation for reasons specified previously. We performed a post-hoc power&#xD;
      calculation. We assumed that the distribution of pregnant women attending ANC was Poisson&#xD;
      distributed. We assumed that the number of pregnant women in each community was equal (i.e.&#xD;
      we assumed equal offsets for control and intervention arms). We assumed that over-dispersion&#xD;
      is not present when conducting the power calculation (i.e. we assumed the Poisson mean is&#xD;
      equal to the Poisson variance). Our goal was to test whether the ratio of the Poisson rates&#xD;
      was equal to 1 (i.e. the rate of women attending ANC was equal in the control and&#xD;
      intervention arms). Assuming a rate ratio of 2, we required 25 women attending ANC in the&#xD;
      control arm and 50 women attending ANC in the intervention arm to achieve 80% power to reject&#xD;
      the null hypothesis of equal rates of attendance. Assuming a rate ratio of 3, we required 10&#xD;
      women attending ANC in the control arm and 30 women attending ANC in the intervention arm to&#xD;
      achieve 80% power to reject the null hypothesis of equal rates of attendance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic data was summarized using simple descriptive statistics. We computed rates of ANC&#xD;
      uptake, first ANC use and ANC uptake due to pOBU, respectively, and all at the cluster level.&#xD;
      The count of the number of women attending ANC, for each specific outcome, formed the&#xD;
      numerator of the rate. The ideal denominator for the rate calculation would be the number of&#xD;
      women who were aware that they were pregnant during the study period. This denominator was&#xD;
      unavailable so we used the number of women attending first ANC in 2013-2014 through&#xD;
      government run clinics as a proxy. We expressed all rates per 1,000 women. Using Poisson&#xD;
      regression, and Pearson's correction factor for over-dispersion, we tested whether the ratio&#xD;
      of rates in the control and intervention arms were equal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We compared the estimated rates in each intervention group with the control group and also in&#xD;
      each intervention group with other intervention groups (we computed all possible pair-wise&#xD;
      rate ratios between trial arms). We chose to reject the null hypothesis of equal rates of ANC&#xD;
      uptake at a 5% alpha level. All statistical analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.4&#xD;
      (Cary, North Carolina). Since the outcomes reported were at the health facility (cluster)&#xD;
      level, no further special analyses to account for clustering were conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Role of the Funding Source The funding source of this study was the Canadian not for profit&#xD;
      corporation Bridge to Health Medical and Dental (BTH). BTH is primarily funded through&#xD;
      unrestricted donations from Canadian corporations (such as Cole Engineering, Lebovic&#xD;
      Enterprises and other smaller donors), Canadian Rotary Clubs, and small private donors. None&#xD;
      of the donors had any conflicts of interest. None of the Canadian investigators received any&#xD;
      personal compensation for their work on this project. The organization has no proprietary&#xD;
      holdings on the technology used in this study nor does it, or its investigators, receive any&#xD;
      financial compensation for sales of portable ultrasound technology. Some compensation for&#xD;
      time spent was provided by BTH to the Ugandan research team.&#xD;
