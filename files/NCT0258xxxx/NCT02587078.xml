      The primary alternative hypothesis is that less time (minutes) is required, to achieve the&#xD;
      initial hemodynamic stabilization, with Volulyte® compared to Jonosteril®.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  H01: Minutes with Volulyte® ≥ Minutes with Jonosteril®&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  H11: Minutes with Volulyte® &lt; Minutes with Jonosteril®&#xD;

      Comparative, multicenter, active-controlled, parallel-group, double-blind, randomized study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who meet the inclusion criteria (at Screening, see below for definition) will be&#xD;
      randomized immediately in a ratio of 1:1 to either receive intravenous Volulyte® or&#xD;
      Jonosteril® for fluid resuscitation (on RAND). Fluid resuscitation with study drug will be&#xD;
      started immediately in order to reach initial hemodynamic stabilization. Assessment of the&#xD;
      effects of fluid resuscitation to achieve the primary and secondary endpoints will be&#xD;
      performed up to 24 hours following the randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial hemodynamic stabilization is defined as normalization of mean arterial pressure&#xD;
      (MAP), central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2) and PPV (pulse pressure variation) or&#xD;
      response to PLR (passive leg rising) as defined below and maintaining this normalization over&#xD;
      a period of 1 hour, with no increase in the infusion of vasopressors, or inotropic therapy&#xD;
      and with ≤ 250ml of additional study drug administration within this 1 hour. The&#xD;
      normalization of the parameters MAP and PPV (pulse pressure variation) or PLR (passive leg&#xD;
      rising) and ScvO2 is defined as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MAP: ≥ 65 mmHg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ScvO2: ≥ 70%&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PPV: ≤ 12% (premise: sinus rhythm, no spontaneous breathing efforts and mechanical&#xD;
           ventilation with VT: 5 - &lt; 6 ml/kg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If PPV is not applicable, response to PLR-manoeuvre is used (see below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ● PLR: &lt; 10% change in cardiac output (CO)&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Prior written informed consent of the patient. If this is not possible, it will be&#xD;
             necessary for the investigator to obtain initial informed consent according to the&#xD;
             requirements. The legally authorized representative has to provide the written&#xD;
             informed consent or in his absence a declaration for inclusion in an emergency&#xD;
             situation is to be signed by a consultant physician who is not involved in the study&#xD;
             and who is independent of the investigational team. If the patient dies following the&#xD;
             inclusion in the clinical trial based on the consulting physician´s vote and no&#xD;
             legally authorized representative is available / able to give informed consent, no&#xD;

             randomization, a patient may be randomized and treated initially, however, has to be&#xD;
             withdrawn immediately from the study as soon as the test result becomes available and&#xD;
             is positive).&#xD;

             value is not available at the time of randomization or an available value is older&#xD;
             than 24 hours, a patient may be randomized and treated. If a creatinine value of &gt; 300&#xD;
             μmol/L becomes available later, treatment with the study drug may be continued if the&#xD;
             risk/benefit ratio for the individual patient is regarded as positive by the&#xD;
             investigator.)&#xD;

             adequate fluid resuscitation, along with the presence of hypoperfusion abnormalities&#xD;
             or organ dysfunction as defined by Bone et al., 1992. Patients receiving inotropic or&#xD;
             vasopressor agents may no longer be hypotensive by the time they manifest&#xD;
             hypoperfusion abnormalities or organ dysfunction, yet they would still be considered&#xD;
             to have septic shock. Patients treated with low dose vasopressors are not excluded&#xD;
             provided they are responsive to fluid resuscitation as demonstrated by an individual&#xD;
             fluid challenge. Patients receiving norepinephrine (noradrenaline) or epinephrine&#xD;
             (adrenaline) at a dose &gt; 0.5 μg/kg/min or dopamine at a dose &gt; 15 μg/kg/min at the&#xD;
