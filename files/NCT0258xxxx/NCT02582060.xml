    <textblock>
      Currently dosing for prophylaxis is not individualized, and the general approach is to use a&#xD;
      dose of 25-40 units/kg given 3 times per week or every other day. One of the issues with&#xD;
      weight-based dosing is the possible over-treatment. This is likely due to the fact that&#xD;
      laboratory tests are not sensitive enough at the low levels to support decision-making. The&#xD;
      Thromboelastograph (TEG®) and Thromboelastometry (ROTEM®) are coagulation devices, which&#xD;
      assess the dynamics of clot formation over time and have several characteristics which&#xD;
      suggest they may provide important information for individualized prophylaxis treatment for&#xD;
      our patients.&#xD;

      This is a pilot study in children and adults with severe hemophilia A that utilizes the&#xD;
      TEG/ROTEM to personalize their prophylaxis treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Assess the feasibility of TEG/ROTEM-guided modification of the current prophylaxis regimen&#xD;
      for individuals with severe hemophilia A. Specifically, to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Test and refine the operational protocol for using TEG/ROTEM to guide factor dosing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estimate the proportion of hemophilia A patients whose dose will be modified based on&#xD;
           TEG/ROTEM results&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Monitor short term safety of patients whose dose has been modified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Perform thrombin generation assays to provide additional evidence supporting the&#xD;
           TEG/ROTEM-guided dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obtain preliminary data on the economic impact of TEG/ROTEM-guided hemophilia A dosing&#xD;
           regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obtain preliminary data on the potential improvement of subject/family burden resulting&#xD;
           from TEG/ROTEM-guided regimen using generic and specific quality of life tools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study period will consist of screening, pharmacokinetic (PK) study and follow-up. For&#xD;
      subjects whose prophylaxis treatment regimen is modified, the follow-up period will include 3&#xD;
      follow-up clinic visits and 4 follow-up phone calls; these patients will remain on study for&#xD;
      approximately 6 months following completion of the PK-study then will have an end of the&#xD;
      study visit (visit 9). Subjects whose treatment regimen is not altered will end their study&#xD;
      participation after Visit 2 and continuing with their current prophylaxis regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study endpoints: A safety review will be conducted after the first 6 subjects complete 30&#xD;
      days with the extended prophylaxis treatment. If no safety issues are identified, the study&#xD;
      will proceed, and second safety review will be after an additional 8 subjects complete 30&#xD;
      days of extended treatment. If a subject has two or more spontaneous bleeds in 30 days, the&#xD;
      subject will be removed from the study. For subjects who did not have bleeds and completed at&#xD;
      least 6 months of the study, ongoing prophylactic treatment will be decided by their treating&#xD;
      physician.&#xD;
