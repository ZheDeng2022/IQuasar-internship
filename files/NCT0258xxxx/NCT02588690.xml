  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death world-wide in women. Despite&#xD;
      current medical advances, heart disease is rising in relatively young women. Women access&#xD;
      primary care differently than men, most utilizing their Obstetrics-gynecology clinic for&#xD;
      primary care services. The recent implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) aims to&#xD;
      provide increased access to primary care services, however, women are still not appropriately&#xD;
      risk stratified for CVD disease risk. Many women still are not aware that they are at risk&#xD;
      for CVD. This is particularly true for the 15-44 year old female age group. Lack of proper&#xD;
      risk stratification may be related to women not being properly identified or appropriately&#xD;
      referred to preventive cardiovascular services for treatment of traditional risk factors such&#xD;
      as diabetes, obesity, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. These traditional risk markers serve as&#xD;
      examples of chronic diseases, which are not always recognized in the early stages and&#xD;
      therefore not optimally managed. Furthermore, if women are not feeling ill, they are less&#xD;
      likely to access their current primary care resources for preventive strategies.&#xD;
      Investigators propose to risk stratify women in places where they usually congregate. In&#xD;
      addition to convenience, current risk stratification is improved with the recent&#xD;
      implementation of the ASCVD risk calculator. Investigators hypothesize that if women were&#xD;
      properly risk stratified and referred to appropriate preventive cardiovascular risk clinics,&#xD;
      more preventive strategies could be implemented, therefore reducing the amount of unnecessary&#xD;
      premature disease in women. To achieve this ambitious goal, investigators propose a three&#xD;
      step, demonstration project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of this proposal is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Provide women with CVD risk stratification in places where they locally convene on a&#xD;
           daily basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the efficacy of a lay professional to adequately assess CVD risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate if assessment of CVD risk reduces the amount of future CVD (unsure if this&#xD;
           can be measured in this project).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Demonstrate feasibility and acceptability of strategies utilizing ASCVD risk assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Improve ASCVD risk scores one year follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Increase heart disease awareness through marketing materials in women in Los Angeles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Develop preliminary feasibility and efficacy data for a large clinical outcome trial.&#xD;

      ACTIVITIES PLANNED FOR OCTOBER 2015 THROUGH DECEMBER 2015&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. October 2015: The Barbra Streisand Women's Heart Center (BSWHC) research team will work&#xD;
           closely with the Preventive Cardiovascular Nurses Association (PCNA), Los Angeles (LA)&#xD;
           Chapter as well as the community partners will develop a detailed, comprehensive&#xD;
           screening, education, referral and ASCVD tool kit. The tool kit will include a basic&#xD;
           demographic screening questionnaire, smart-phone ASCVD risk calculator software,&#xD;
           cholestech finger stick supplies, blood pressure equipment, Heart Truth program&#xD;
           materials, and Red dress pins. Educational materials developed by all partners for each&#xD;
           community highlighting Heart Truth branding will be included. A list and specific&#xD;
           contacts for proximate California Affordable Care Act (ACA) Community Medical Homes will&#xD;
           be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. October 2015: 2 women heart disease patient volunteers from Central and/or East Los&#xD;
           Angeles will travel to the Mayo Clinic through the WomenHeart Program for public&#xD;
           speaking and peer group leadership training.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. November 2015: The 88th Street Temple Church in central Los Angeles will help develop a&#xD;
           detailed screening tool kit with training, educational materials and collaboration with&#xD;
           Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (CSMC) staff to perform 100 ASCVD risk assessments after&#xD;
           church services.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. DECEMBER 2015: The Hadassah Zionist Women's Group, Los Angeles Chapter will host a mall&#xD;
           walking event targeting Orthodox Jewish women for screening. They will help develop a&#xD;
           detailed screening tool kit with training, educational materials and collaboration by&#xD;
           CSMC staff to perform 100 ASCVD risk assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ACTIVITIES PLANNED FOR JANUARY 2016 THROUGH MAY 2016&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. February 2016: The CSMC Heart Truth, Wear Red Day Event: Our 2015 Heart Truth/Wear Red&#xD;
           Day event had over 600 attendees and screened 200 women CSMC employees. If funded, the&#xD;
           2016 program will be open to the public.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. February 2016: Beauty Shop Screenings. 3 local nursing organization chapters (Hispanic&#xD;
           Nurses Society Los Angeles Chapter, Black Nurses Society LA Chapter, and Philippine&#xD;
           Nurses Association of Southern California) will individually host a screening day in a&#xD;
           community hair salon for at least 100 women at each site. This project is modeled after&#xD;
           the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI)-sponsored Cedars-Sinai (CS)&#xD;
           Barber-1 project which demonstrated blood pressure reduction in African American men&#xD;
           using their barber as health educator. Each organization will receive a screening tool&#xD;
           kit with training, educational materials and collaboration with CSMC staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. May 2016: CSMC Telemundo Community Outreach Program. Nearly 1,500 Latino women were&#xD;
           screened last year at the CSMC Telemundo event. The investigators will utilize the&#xD;
           screening tool kit with intensive training, educational materials and close&#xD;
           collaboration with CSMC staff. The theme of the 2016 event will be The Heart Truth: for&#xD;
           women by women.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. May 2016: Mother's Day Dinner and Health Fair at Jordan Downs Housing Development. CSMC&#xD;
           Coach for Kids will host an annual Mother's Day Dinner for approximately 200 women at&#xD;
           the Jordan Downs (public) Housing Development in Central Los Angeles. The community is&#xD;
           low-income with approximately 50% African American and 50% Latino ethnicity. A health&#xD;
           lecture (presented in both English and Spanish) and a health fair will utilize the&#xD;
           detailed screening tool kit with Heart Truth materials.&#xD;

Women will be risk stratified based on ASCVD risk calculation and if labeled high risk will be referred to physician services. In 1 year, women will have their ASCVD re-risk stratify to see if seeing a physician/ health care provider reduced overall ASCVD risk scores.</description>
