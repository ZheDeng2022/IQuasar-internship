  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Women's Ischemia Study Evaluation (WISE), a cohort study of over 1000 women, has made&#xD;
      many contributions to the understanding of cardiovascular disease. A milestone acknowledged&#xD;
      in the 2011 AHA Herrick Lecture is the role of Coronary Microvascular Dysfunction (CMD) in&#xD;
      women with symptoms/signs of ischemia without obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD).&#xD;
      While in 1996, CMD was considered &quot;an imaging artifact&quot;, in 2013, it is a widely accepted as&#xD;
      a pathophysiologic process requiring systematic cohesive scientific pursuit. CMD is&#xD;
      prevalent, associated with adverse clinical outcomes, poor quality of life and healthcare&#xD;
      costs rivaling obstructive CAD. There are 2-3 million US women with CMD, and 100,000 new&#xD;
      cases projected annually placing CMD prevalence, morbidity and costs higher than all female&#xD;
      reproductive cancers combined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among women with ischemia, preserved ejection fraction and no obstructive CAD, it has been&#xD;
      observed that there are relatively more new onset heart failure (HF) hospitalizations than&#xD;
      nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI). It has been hypothesized that CMD contributes to left&#xD;
      ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction and subsequent heart failure with preserved ejection&#xD;
      fraction (HFpEF). Preliminary data further suggests that left ventricular diastolic&#xD;
      dysfunction is linked to CMD via a mechanism of augmentation and/or perpetuation by&#xD;
      cardiomyocyte fat accumulation. HFpEF is prevalent in women and older men, but poorly&#xD;
      understood. Mechanistic understanding is critical to HFpEF intervention and guideline&#xD;
      development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypotheses are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Risk factor conditions (hypertension, dyslipidemia, dysglycemia, loss of estrogen)&#xD;
           promote an inflammatory and pro-oxidative state making the microvasculature vulnerable;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Vulnerable coronary microvasculature becomes dysregulated (sympathetic nervous system&#xD;
           activation, endothelial dysfunction, changes in vascular smooth muscle activation,&#xD;
           spasm) causing repeated episodes of transient ischemia;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Repeated ischemia-reperfusion episodes facilitate preconditioning with preservation of&#xD;
           cardiomyocyte contractile and microvascular function against ischemic injury;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Ischemia-reperfusion and preconditioning lead to cardiomyocyte fat accumulation and&#xD;
           relaxation impairment resulting in diastolic dysfunction and heart failure with&#xD;
           preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).&#xD;

      The current application will study new cohorts of women and men with the following specific&#xD;
      aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: LV diastolic dysfunction is linked to CMD. Sub-Aim 1: LV diastolic&#xD;
      dysfunction and CMD are linked via the mechanism of cardiomyocyte fat accumulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: Comprehensive noninvasive Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (CMRI) that&#xD;
      includes LV diastolic function is linked with invasive measures of LV diastolic function and&#xD;
      can optimize diagnosis of CMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-Aim 2: Coronary Magnetic Resonance Angiography (CMRA) can exclude obstructive CAD in CMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: Add completely de-identified data sharing to prepare for future large&#xD;
      precision medicine research and to advance precision medicine initiative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Aim: Blood proteomic and metabolomics biomarkers of extracellular matrix&#xD;
      remodeling and fibrosis combined with ischemia measures will predict HFpEF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this prospective, cohort design study, investigators intend to enroll 220 new subjects&#xD;
      including 120 symptomatic women undergoing invasive coronary angiography for suspected&#xD;
      ischemia with no obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) defined as ≥50% luminal diameter&#xD;
      stenosis in ≥1 epicardial coronary artery and 100 women and men hospitalized for Heart&#xD;
      Failure with preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF) defined by the European Society of&#xD;
      Cardiology (ESC) criteria who have not yet undergone coronary angiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New and existing samples and longer term follow-up will be analyzed in an exploratory fashion&#xD;
      looking for potential HFpEF biomarkers for pilot data purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After baseline evaluation, the n=120 cohort will undergo noninvasive high resolution,&#xD;
      comprehensive CMRI imaging, invasive angiography, coronary reactivity testing and rest-stress&#xD;
      Millar pressure-volume measurement. Handgrip, mild leg exercise, and brief Valsalva Maneuver&#xD;
      will be conducted during CMRI and Millar pressure-volume assessment to characterize cardiac&#xD;
      response to stress. Lastly, these patients will also undergo MR Coronary Angiography, for&#xD;
      validation purposes against gold-standard angiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cohort of 100 women and men with HFpEF admitted to the hospital who have not yet&#xD;
      undergone coronary angiography will also undergo CMRI (with stress), including MR coronary&#xD;
      angiography (CMRA) and noninvasive computed coronary tomographic angiography (CCTA)(CSMC&#xD;
      only).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will provide understanding of a non-cath-lab based population regarding links between&#xD;
      CMD, diastolic function and HFpEF, and will result in data to test the hypothesis that&#xD;
      coronary MRA can exclude obstructive CAD and diagnose CMD without ionizing radiation.&#xD;
      Proteomic and metabolomics biomarker assays in the (n=567) subjects with no obstructive CAD&#xD;
      (Exploratory Aim) will be performed.&#xD;
