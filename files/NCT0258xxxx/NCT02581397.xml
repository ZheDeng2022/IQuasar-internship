      This study evaluates the non-inferiority of Suppository Transpulmin and Suppository Guaiacol&#xD;
      compared to Transpulmin Syrup in the treatment of cough with secretion of infectious origin&#xD;
      in children between two and six years old. One third of participants will receive Suppository&#xD;
      Transpulmin, the other one third will receive Suppository Guaiacol and the last one third&#xD;
      will receive Transpulmin Syrup.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Suppository Transpulmin, Suppository Guaiacol and Transpulmin Syrup are administered in the&#xD;
      treatment of cough with secretion of infectious origin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each Suppository Transpulmin contains eucalyptol, menthol, camphor and guaiacol. The main&#xD;
      pharmacological activity of eucalyptol occurs in the respiratory tract, playing expectorant&#xD;
      action, fluidity and antiseptic. There are indications that eucalyptol be a controller&#xD;
      inflammatory mediators, intervening directly in the pathophysiology of airway inflammation.&#xD;
      On the other hand, menthol has spasmolytic effect antiflatulent, antipruritic, analgesic and&#xD;
      antiemetic the mucosae, which has been shown in various studies in vitro and in vivo. In&#xD;
      addition, effective against many kinds of bacteria and fungi. Camphor, in turn, is used in&#xD;
      respiratory dysfunction due to secretolytic and antispasmodic properties (bronchi). Finally,&#xD;
      the guaiacol is classified as an expectorant because it believes that promote increased&#xD;
      sputum volume and decrease its viscosity, resulting in effective coughing. However, despite&#xD;
      its extensive use in recent decades, there are few randomized controlled trials demonstrating&#xD;
      its efficacy and tolerability, especially in pediatric participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each Suppository Guaiacol contains guaiacol, whose action was explained previously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, each Transpulmin Syrup contains guaifenesin, which chemically it is a glyceryl ether&#xD;
      guaiacol. Thus, their structures are similar, and their pharmacological effects and&#xD;
      mechanisms of action. The addition of the hydroxyl group increases the hydrophilicity, making&#xD;
      the compound more soluble, thus being more suitable for pharmaceutical syrup form.&#xD;
