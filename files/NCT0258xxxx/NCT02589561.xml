      Currently, the fitting of hearing aids is using a computer interface that allows to adjust&#xD;
      the gain and compression of acoustic amplification. This adjustment is made face to face,&#xD;
      patient and audiologist being located in a soundproof space to test the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      hearing aid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, advances in telemedicine in this context, let consider the possibility of addressing&#xD;
      these hearing aids fitting via the same computer interface, but remotely controlled by the&#xD;
      hearing care professional. The purpose of this study is to assess the ability to perform&#xD;
      these tests no longer in front of the patient settings, but away from it, and without visual&#xD;
      and sound contact other than through a computer interface.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end, this project wants to show that a remote fitting is an acceptable procedure that&#xD;
      provides comparable results to-face fitting in terms of speech perception, speech in noise&#xD;
      audiometry, hearing loss related quality of life in order to be able to offer this type of&#xD;
      strategy.&#xD;

      1. Background and rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Currently, the fitting of hearing aids is using a computer interface that allows to&#xD;
           adjust the gain and compression of acoustic amplification. This adjustment is made face&#xD;
           to face, patient and audiologist being located in a soundproof space to test the&#xD;
           effectiveness of the hearing aid.&#xD;
&#xD;
           However, advances in telemedicine in this context, let consider the possibility of&#xD;
           addressing these hearing aids fitting via the same computer interface, but remotely&#xD;
           controlled by the hearing care professional. The purpose of this study is to assess the&#xD;
           ability to perform these tests no longer in front of the patient settings, but away from&#xD;
           it, and without visual and sound contact other than through a computer interface.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Objectives Main objective: To show that the remote fitting of hearing aids using the&#xD;
           platform developed by AudioProConnect provides speech perception scores similar to those&#xD;
           obtained by a face-control, after 5 weeks of use among experienced hearing aid users.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary Objectives: To compare the duration and the quality of both types of fitting,&#xD;
           speech in noise testing, deafness related quality of life and assess the wearing time of&#xD;
           hearing aids.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Methods DESIGN: Biomedical research on health product, prospective, multicenter,&#xD;
           randomized, and crossover study to assess the remote fitting of hearing aids: Study&#xD;
           REFIT-HEARING Study Population: adults with bilateral hearing aids. Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
           Patient aged between 18 and 85 years old, with hearing loss and using two hearing aids&#xD;
           for more than one year, and compatible with AudioProConnect platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Exclusion criteria: Patient with fluctuations of pure tone audiometry, cognitive&#xD;
           disorders or severe speech disorders. Patient unable to move in an audiology laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Primary Outcome: Evaluation of speech perception score with PBK test free-field at 60&#xD;
           dB.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary endpoints: assessment of quality control by measuring the pitch gain, duration&#xD;
           of fitting in minutes, speech in noise audiometry, the wearing time of hearing aids in&#xD;
           hours, the quality of life related to hearing loss via the APHAB questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Number of patients: 60 subjects Procedure (number of visits, length of inclusions,&#xD;
           duration of follow-up, study schedule patient visits content, brief description of&#xD;
           intervention): After the investigator has verified the criteria of inclusion / non&#xD;
           inclusion and the subject has signed the written informed consent, the subject will be&#xD;
           followed for a period ranging from 2 months to 5 months, during which he attended four&#xD;
           visits in a audiology laboratory referenced in this project. During these visits, a&#xD;
           fitting of hearing aids face to face or remotely will be realized, and it will be asked&#xD;
           to answer a questionnaire to assess quality of life between the two fitting techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Study Schedule:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Inclusion period: 3 months (M3-M6) Duration of the study for one subject: 2 months to 5&#xD;
           months (M6 to M8 or M6 to M11) Duration statistical analysis / recovery: 3 months&#xD;
           (M11-M14) Global Study duration: 14 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Outlook At the end, this project wants to show that a remote fitting provides comparable&#xD;
           results to-face fitting in terms of speech perception, in order to be able to offer this&#xD;
           type of strategy.&#xD;
