    <textblock>
      Stroke is the third most common cause of death in the United States after heart disease and&#xD;
      cancer. An innovative recovery treatment is in demand for stroke motor recovery. Paired&#xD;
      associative stimulation (PAS) is a new technique where one pairs a peripheral stimulation&#xD;
      with centrally applied transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and produces plasticity, as&#xD;
      measured by TMS motor-evoked potentials (MEP's). The investigators will also compare&#xD;
      post-stroke patients to healthy controls on the modulation effect of PAS and motor behavior&#xD;
      measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim1. To investigate whether PAS (PAS25 or PAS10) can modulate motor excitability and&#xD;
      plasticity;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim2. To investigate whether PAS can modify motor behaviors measures in both post-stroke&#xD;
      patients and healthy controls;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim3. To investigate whether post-stroke patients show different modulation of PAS on both&#xD;
      cortical plasticity and motor behavior measure compared to healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study the investigators will enroll a total of 10 chronic stroke patients and 10&#xD;
      neurologically healthy controls matched for age and gender. Participants will have 4 visits.&#xD;
      The first visit is for screening. They will receive either sham PAS or real PAS25 or real&#xD;
      PAS10 at each following treatment visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Methods: Clinical Behavioral Measures: Handgrip; Nine-hole Peg Test; Wolf Motor&#xD;
      Function Test; Imaging protocol: T1 weighted anatomical image, fluid attenuation inversion&#xD;
      recovery (FLAIR) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI); Stimulation locations: Left primary&#xD;
      motor (M1); right median nerve; PAS methods: TMS stimulation will be delivered at 25 ms or 10&#xD;
      ms or 100 ms after median nerve stimulation.&#xD;

    <description>Paired associative stimulation (PAS) is a new technique where one pairs a peripheral stimulation with centrally applied transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and produces plasticity, as measured by TMS MEP's. Currently PAS is performed with median nerve stimulation. The interval between median nerve stimulation and TMS was chosen to be 10 ms, which is called PAS10.
