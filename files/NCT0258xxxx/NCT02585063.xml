  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The UK government's Crown report titled 'Review of prescribing, supply &amp; administration of&#xD;
      medicines' enabled optometrists to train for the qualification of independent prescribing&#xD;
      (IP). The UK introduced IP for optometrists in 2009. The proposed research focuses on the&#xD;
      role of IP optometrist in the acute ophthalmic services of Manchester Royal Eye Hospital&#xD;
      (MREH). The study will compare IP optometrists to consultant ophthalmologists in the ability&#xD;
      to diagnose, manage and prescribe medication for patients accessing these services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve this comparison consenting participants will first have a clinical assessment with&#xD;
      the IP Optometrist, where findings including diagnosis and management plan will be recorded&#xD;
      onto a research proforma. The consultant ophthalmologist will be masked to the IP&#xD;
      Optometrist's research proforma to prevent bias. The consultant ophthalmologist will then&#xD;
      perform a clinical assessment on a second proforma and inform the participant of their&#xD;
      diagnosis and management plan. Percentage agreement, kappa (κ) and weighted κ will be&#xD;
      calculated for a range of parameters between the two proformas. Disagreement in diagnosis or&#xD;
      management will be arbitrated by a separate ophthalmologist participating in the study with a&#xD;
      specialty relevant to the participant's condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the research is to expand the limited base of evidence of of IP&#xD;
      optometrists' ability to diagnose, manage and prescribe medication and to determine whether&#xD;
      they work at least as safely and effectively as consultant ophthalmologists in acute&#xD;
      ophthalmic services. It is the first study in this area since the advent of IP for&#xD;
      optometrists, with only one previous study published before IP was introduced. The research&#xD;
      will enable the type and frequency of conditions presenting in these services to be measured.&#xD;
      Furthermore it will identify conditions that IP optometrists can manage independently and&#xD;
      enable guidelines for these conditions to be developed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      What are the purpose and objectives of the research?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this prospective, masked, controlled comparative study is to measure the&#xD;
      agreement in diagnosis between IP optometrists and the reference standard of consultant&#xD;
      ophthalmologists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary aim is to measure agreement in management of the diagnosis, including the&#xD;
      decision whether or not to prescribe medication. The choice of not prescribing medication is&#xD;
      an important prescribing decision and will be counted as such. This measure is the novel&#xD;
      aspect of the research as it provides evidence of IP optometrists' ability to safely&#xD;
      prescribe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What is the scientific justification for the research?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NHS's emergency services are experiencing increasing demand (Ismail et al 2013), which is&#xD;
      also true of MREH's Acute Referral Centre where IP optometrists work as part of a&#xD;
      multidisciplinary team. There is a scientific need to provide an evidence base to validate&#xD;
      and support the role of optometrists working in acute ophthalmic services, as well as provide&#xD;
      evidence of IP optometrist's ability to safely prescribe medication. This evidence base may&#xD;
      in turn lend support to nationally extending the role of IP Optometrists' and their skills to&#xD;
      the benefit of the Health Service. Establishing an audit meets the clinic need to monitor&#xD;
      performance of IP optometrists working in this extended role. Guidelines for IP optometrists&#xD;
      working within MREH Acute Ophthalmic Services offer a way to optimise the running of the&#xD;
      clinic as patient can be triaged to clinicians and ophthalmologists feed to see complex&#xD;
      cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A novel aspect of this study is that it will compare optometrists' management decisions&#xD;
      involving the prescribing of ocular medication since IP was introduced (General Optical&#xD;
      Council 2014). There is no evidence of studies into the safety of such prescribing decisions&#xD;
      by IP optometrists in acute ophthalmic care. Hau et al (2007) study entitled 'An evaluation&#xD;
      of optometrists' ability to correctly identify and manage patient s with ocular disease in&#xD;
      the accident and emergency department of an eye hospital' was before the introduction of IP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will begin in Summer 2015, pending ethics approval, and will last for 18 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample of up to 1500 may be achieved based on 20 participants per week over a period of 18&#xD;
      months. This breaks down to 2.5 participants per study session. It is anticipated that the&#xD;
      principal IP optometrist of the Acute Referral clinic who works there 4 sessions a week will&#xD;
      have the potential to perform ~690 clinical assessments for the study. The remaining three IP&#xD;
      optometrists who work one session a week will have the potential to perform ~172 clinical&#xD;
      assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample size of 500 with disagreement on diagnosis in 15 individuals is required to give a&#xD;
      target disagreement rate of 3.0% (binomial 95% CI 1.7-4.9%). The larger anticipated sample&#xD;
      size will ensure that at least 500 are available where a prescribing decision has been made,&#xD;
      whilst maintaining small binomial confidence intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol for the study is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Recruitment Patients will be invited to take part in the study and given the study&#xD;
           information either while being triaged in the walk-in, nurse-led Emergency Eye Centre&#xD;
           (EEC) to the appointments-based Acute Referral Clinic (ARC) or at arrival at ARC. An&#xD;
           approved poster will advertise the study and will be place on the wall in both ARC and&#xD;
           EEC. There will be a smaller version on the reception desk at both ARC and EEC&#xD;
           accompanied by a participant information leaflet.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Willingness to participate may depend on the individual and their presenting complaint.&#xD;
           It may be expected that someone with severe symptoms who is triaged to be seen more&#xD;
           urgently would be less inclined to have two clinical assessments. Analysis of the&#xD;
           presenting complaints may identify trends in the severity versus participation in the&#xD;
           study. It will be made clear that there is no obligation to participate and that if&#xD;
           people do decide to take part that they can withdraw at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Informed consent There are aspects about the way that the data will be used that&#xD;
           warrants the consent of participants, with adequate assurance that privacy and&#xD;
           confidentiality will be maintained. All participating optometrists and ophthalmologists&#xD;
           will take informed consent. The clinicians will be trained in Good Clinical Practice and&#xD;
           taking informed consent. Consent may take place during the 4 hour wait in the clinic or&#xD;
           upon returning for a follow up appointment where appropriate (participants can only have&#xD;
           the comparative clinical assessments once to ensure masking).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Participant allocation and capping Where there is time and space, participants will be&#xD;
           allocated to have a clinical assessment by the IP optometrist during their wait for the&#xD;
           clinical assessment with the ophthalmologist. Both clinical assessments are needed to&#xD;
           obtain measurement of agreement.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sessions where a Consultant Ophthalmologist is in ARC will be allocated as a 'study&#xD;
           session'. The study sessions will need to be allocated to ensure that approximately&#xD;
           equal numbers of patients will be seen by the participating IP Optometrists. Consultant&#xD;
           ophthalmologists with various specialties work with IP optometrists across 8 half day&#xD;
           clinics during the week. A limitation of collecting data from these set times is that if&#xD;
           there are conditions specific to presenting on an evening or weekend they will not be&#xD;
           sampled representatively. Whilst this restricts analysis of certain conditions it&#xD;
           ensures the focus of the study, evaluation of management by IP Optometrists to be&#xD;
           achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A pragmatic approach will be required for the recruitment of patients into the study&#xD;
           given organisational issues or limited time and rooms available to see patients. The&#xD;
           recruitment per session for the comparative arm of the study can be capped by the&#xD;
           Ophthalmologist within the clinic. Allowing a cap ensures that waiting times are kept&#xD;
           within reason and the level of care is maintained. The cap risks introducing selection&#xD;
           bias as potential participants presenting to clinic early may be more likely to be have&#xD;
           the two comparative clinical assessments. The time of attendance in clinic will be&#xD;
           recorded to monitor if this happens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. IP optometrist's clinical assessment The following protocol is relevant for participants&#xD;
           undergoing the two comparative clinical assessments. The IP optometrists will receive&#xD;
           the patient's notes, temporary if presenting on the day, or full notes if attending a&#xD;
           follow up. There may be nursing notes including from the same day including the&#xD;
           following; patient history record of measured vision or visual acuity (including pin&#xD;
           hole visual acuity where it is reduced to 0.20logMAR or less), findings from an&#xD;
           assessment by slit-lamp of the front of the eye, measurement of intraocular pressure, a&#xD;
           record of pupil reaction and time of pupil dilation where appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The consultation will be documented on the study proforma and include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  history and symptoms including where appropriate; medical history, medication,&#xD;
                previous ocular history, family history, occupation, driving status.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  examination of the anterior segment of the eye by slit-lamp or direct&#xD;
                ophthalmoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  examination of the posterior segment where appropriate by direct ophthalmoscopy or&#xD;
                indirect biomicroscopy&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  tonometry (if not previously recorded)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  other diagnostic tests as needed (e.g. pachymetry, colour vision).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The assessment is expected to lead to the formation of a working diagnosis and&#xD;
           management plan including the following where appropriate; prescribing ophthalmic&#xD;
           medication, follow-up, referral or discharge. The proforma will have boxes to record&#xD;
           diagnosis (primary and secondary where appropriate), management plan, treatment&#xD;
           (including strength and dosing regimen), advice to patient and in addition a comments&#xD;
           box to permit a judgment on whether the case could have been managed solely by an IP&#xD;
           Optometrist. There may be occasions where conditions present outside of the scope of the&#xD;
           IP Optometrists experience, which will be recorded in the comments box noting any&#xD;
           reasons for this.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Masking and storage IP optometrist's proforma The first study proforma will be filed&#xD;
           into one drawer of a cabinet in a lockable office. The proformas will be returned to the&#xD;
           patient notes after the ophthalmologists assessment has concluded and anonymous&#xD;
           photocopies taken of both proformas by the research optometrist (or where there is&#xD;
           absence or holidays a different IP optometrist to ensure masking).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Ophthalmologist's clinical assessment The ophthalmologist will receive their own copy a&#xD;
           proforma along with the patient's notes, but remain masked to the IP optometrist's&#xD;
           assessment. They will follow the same protocol and then confirmation of participant's&#xD;
           diagnosis and management plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Masking and storage of ophthalmologists proforma The ophthalmologist's proforma will be&#xD;
           securely stored in a separate drawer in the lockable office. The proforma will be&#xD;
           returned to the patient notes after anonymous copies of the proforma are photocopied by&#xD;
           the end of the clinical session.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Storage of data Daniel Todd will analyse the anonymous copied proformas and keep the&#xD;
           data stored securely to adhere to the legal requirement of data protection. Proformas&#xD;
           will be kept in secured locked office and electronic data will be encrypted and stored&#xD;
           on secure NHS computer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Statistical analysis of agreement The results of the IP Optometrists' proformas compared&#xD;
           for agreement in diagnosis (primary outcome) and management including prescribed&#xD;
           medication (secondary) against the consultants' proforma. Percentage agreement, kappa&#xD;
           (κ) and weighted κ will be calculated for a range of parameters. A system adapted by&#xD;
           Marks et al (2012) in a comparative of study between ophthalmologists and optometrist in&#xD;
           glaucoma management, which is originally based one by Banes et al (2006) will be&#xD;
           employed where the following scores are given; 1.00 = agreement, 0.75 = 1 step from&#xD;
           agreement, 0.50 = 2 steps from agreement, 0.25 = 3 steps from agreement and 0.00 = 4&#xD;
           steps of more. Agreement between diagnoses and clinical management plans would support&#xD;
           IP Optometrist's role in the field and provide evidence of their ability to safely&#xD;
           prescribe.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Arbitration of disagreement An arbitrator will confirm where there is disagreement; it&#xD;
           may be that several diagnoses apply or different ways of prescribing are acceptable.&#xD;
           Arbitration refers to assessment of agreement and not to the clinical care provided.&#xD;
           Disagreement will be confirmed by showing a participant's notes and proformas to the&#xD;
           arbitrator, who is a second ophthalmologist participating in the study specialty&#xD;
           relevant to the participant's complaint. The arbitrator would provide their diagnosis&#xD;
           and management plan while being masked to those reached by the IP optometrist and first&#xD;
           ophthalmologist. Weekly meeting with each arbitrator will be arranged by Daniel Todd.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Dissemination of results Once the study's data has been collected and analysed then&#xD;
           discussion and conclusions will be published. Where participants have expressly&#xD;
           requested feedback from the study, they will be informed as requested (by telephone,&#xD;
           e-mail or letter).&#xD;
