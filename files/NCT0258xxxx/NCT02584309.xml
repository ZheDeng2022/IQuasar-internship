  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to look at whether giving a drug called dexrazoxane&#xD;
      with standard of care doxorubicin affects the progression of the disease. Dexrazoxane is&#xD;
      often given at the same time as doxorubicin to help reduce the incidence and severity of&#xD;
      disease of the heart muscle (which can be caused by doxorubicin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In January 2019 Eli Lilly and Company reported that the results of the Phase 3 study of&#xD;
      olaratumab (Lartruvo), in combination with doxorubicin in patients with advanced or&#xD;
      metastatic soft tissue sarcoma, did not confirm the clinical benefit of olaratumab in&#xD;
      combination with doxorubicin as compared to doxorubicin alone. Therefore olaratumab is being&#xD;
      removed from the front line standard of care regimen. Amendment #9 was made to the protocol&#xD;
      to reflect these changes to the standard of care treatment.&#xD;

If no event exists, the PFS will be censored at the last scheduled disease assessment on study.&#xD;
Progressive disease - At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.

    <description>Dexrazoxane will be given intravenously on an outpatient basis over 15 minutes on each day that doxorubicin is given.&#xD;
Dexrazoxane should be given no more than 30 minutes prior to administration of doxorubicin, which is typically given on Day 1 of a 21-day cycle.&#xD;
Dosing is a 10:1 ratio of dexrazoxane to doxorubicin; doxorubicin is typically given at 75 mg/m2, so dexrazoxane dosing would be 750 mg/m2.&#xD;
In the event of a national shortage of dexrazoxane, 72-hour infusional doxorubicin can be used instead of dexrazoxane and bolus doxorubicin..</description>
