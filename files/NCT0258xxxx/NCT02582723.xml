  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A double-blind, randomised crossover design will be employed with three experimental&#xD;
      conditions; High protein/high fat hard cheese, high protein/low fat hard cheese, and low&#xD;
      protein/high fat creme cheese served at least 7 days apart. After having successfully&#xD;
      completed screening procedures, eligible participants will be invited for three separate test&#xD;
      days. The test days should be performed at least 7 days apart; however for logistical reasons&#xD;
      4 days can be accepted. On the test days, the products will be provided in a randomized&#xD;
      order, and subjective appetite ratings will be measured every 30 minutes for the following 3&#xD;
      hours. Subsequent energy intake will be measured by an ad libitum meal 3 hours following&#xD;
      serving of the breakfast meal.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Participants will arrive at the laboratory after an overnight fast (at least from 10:00 pm)&#xD;
      with the use of the least strenuously transportation possible (no bicycling or long distance&#xD;
      walk). In addition, the preceding two days (48h) before each of the study days; no intensive&#xD;
      physical activity or consumption of alcohol is allowed in order to obtain standardization of&#xD;
      the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once settled into an individual feeding cubicle, visual analogue scales (VAS) will be&#xD;
      completed for the measurement of fasting appetite levels. A standardized fixed breakfast meal&#xD;
      (providing approximately 20% of total estimated energy need) consisting of 80 g. cheese with&#xD;
      bread, orange juice and a cup (125 mL) of coffee/the/water (milk is not allowed). The amounts&#xD;
      of bread (70.5 g.) and juice (132 g.) are calculated with Babybel original as reference, and&#xD;
      these amounts for bread and juice are kept constant regardless of the cheese provided. The&#xD;
      cheese will be served blinded together with the bread, and the brand of cheese will not be&#xD;
      mentioned for the participants. Participants will be asked to consume this breakfast within&#xD;
      15 minutes and the exact meal duration (in minutes) will be noted after completing the meal&#xD;
      in order to examine the eating rate. VAS will be used to measure subjective appetite&#xD;
      sensations during the post-meal period as well as the pleasantness of the meal and the study&#xD;
      products after completing the meal. VAS will be used to measure subjective appetite&#xD;
      sensations for the following hours. Three hours following serving of the breakfast meal,&#xD;
      participants will be provided with a homogeneous single item ad libitum lunch meal. The meal&#xD;
      is a homogeneous dish of spaghetti bolognese providing a total of 8 MJ and the participants&#xD;
      are instructed to eat until they are comfortably full. The energy composition of the meal is&#xD;
      15 E% protein, 30 E% fat and 55 E% carbohydrate. VAS will be used to measure subjective&#xD;
      appetite sensations during the post-meal period as well as the pleasantness of the meal after&#xD;
      completing the meal. The meal duration (in minutes) will be noted after completing the meal.&#xD;
      The ad libitum meal ends the study day, and the participant will be free to leave afterwards.&#xD;
