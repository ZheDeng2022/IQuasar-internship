      National, multicenter study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of 3 periods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A baseline visit to confirm that patient is still in CIS status. All patients will be&#xD;
           clinically evaluated for CDMS and an MRI (less than 2 months) will be analyzed to&#xD;
           exclude MS patients according to 2010 Mc Donald's criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Treatment period with timed evaluations&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Post-treatment period: 4 weeks, with 2 visits following study drug discontinuation and&#xD;
           accelerated elimination procedure. All patients who discontinue the study drug and&#xD;
           according to investgator's decision, will perform the accelerated elimination procedure&#xD;
           and the post- accelerated elimination visits (at 2 and 4 weeks after the end of&#xD;
           treatment (EOT).&#xD;
