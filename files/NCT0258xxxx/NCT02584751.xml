  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Respiratory dysfunction, esophageal dysmotility, and a gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)&#xD;
      have been demonstrated to be highly prevalent in persons with SCI. GERD has been linked to&#xD;
      respiratory symptoms and conditions such as asthma, chronic cough, and an increased rate of&#xD;
      respiratory infections in the general population. In persons with asthma, respiratory&#xD;
      symptoms and dependency on asthma medications have been reduced by treatment with anti-reflux&#xD;
      medication. Possible mechanisms have been proposed for this link, including the&#xD;
      microaspiration of reflux materials, which may result in airway acidification and aspiration&#xD;
      pneumonia, or the stimulation of the vagus nerve through acid-sensitive receptors in the&#xD;
      esophagus with associated esophageal inflammation and reflex bronchoconstriction.&#xD;
      Investigators propose to study the effects of anti-reflux therapy (proton pump inhibition) in&#xD;
      persons with SCI on objective and subjective symptoms of respiratory function to determine&#xD;
      the underlying mechanisms of airway inflammation due to GERD.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Complete or partial loss of respiratory muscle innervation in individuals with cervical&#xD;
      (C1-8) and high thoracic (T1-6) injuries leads to inadequate ventilation and inability to&#xD;
      effectively clear secretions, often prompting supportive ventilation following initial&#xD;
      injury. Development of atelectasis, pneumonias and respiratory failure are the most common&#xD;
      respiratory complications observed during the acute phase of injury. The role of chronic&#xD;
      airway inflammation on pulmonary function in persons with SCI is unknown, although the&#xD;
      investigators' recent work has shown that individuals with cervical SCI have elevated levels&#xD;
      of exhaled nitric oxide (NO), comparable to those seen in mild asthma. It is now widely&#xD;
      believed that in the airways of asthmatic patients, the release of NO represents a&#xD;
      physiological mechanism to counteract the bronchoconstriction caused by various stimuli. In&#xD;
      persons with cervical SCI, bronchoconstriction may represent a consequence of unopposed&#xD;
      parasympathetic influence, but alternative mechanisms, such as recurrent infections secondary&#xD;
      to impaired cough effectiveness, systemic inflammatory response following SCI, or&#xD;
      extra-esophageal manifestations of underlying esophageal dysmotility and/or GERD need to be&#xD;
      evaluated. In general population, it has been long recognized that esophageal dysmotility&#xD;
      and/or GERD may lead to extra-esophageal manifestations. Reflux can affect both upper and&#xD;
      lower respiratory systems leading to the variety of extra-esophageal manifestations, such as&#xD;
      reflux asthma, chronic cough, hoarseness, chronic sinusitis, laryngitis, loss of dental&#xD;
      enamel, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, recurrent pneumonia, chronic bronchitis, etc. 2&#xD;
      possible mechanisms of these complications have been identified: the direct aspiration of&#xD;
      reflux content and indirectly, stimulation of vagally-mediated reflexes. Regardless of the&#xD;
      underlying mechanisms, treatments with acid-reducing therapies have shown improvement in GERD&#xD;
      and extra-esophageal manifestations of the disease the general population. Investigators&#xD;
      propose to study the effects of anti-reflux therapy (proton pump inhibition) in persons with&#xD;
      SCI on objective and subjective symptoms of respiratory function to determine the underlying&#xD;
      mechanisms of airway inflammation due to GERD.&#xD;
