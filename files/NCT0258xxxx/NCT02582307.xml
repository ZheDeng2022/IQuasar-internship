  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is ample evidence that pain in children is under recognized and under treated. This is&#xD;
      especially true for acute abdominal pain, a common complaint in the paediatric emergency&#xD;
      department. Clinicians often fear that analgesia will obscure the diagnosis of a potentially&#xD;
      surgical condition. As a result, acute abdominal pain goes untreated in many children, as&#xD;
      there is no standard of care. Hyoscine N-butylbromide (Buscopan) has been used successfully&#xD;
      in adults and children for pain associated with urinary tract infections and kidney stones&#xD;
      for over 60 years. However, no study has explored its usefulness in relieving acute abdominal&#xD;
      pain in children. The objectives of this study are to investigate to what degree Buscopan is&#xD;
      effective in relieving abdominal pain in children compared to acetaminophen.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute abdominal pain is a common complaint among paediatric patients visiting the emergency&#xD;
      department (ED). Functional abdominal pain is not associated with any surgical or infectious&#xD;
      etiology and is a frequent cause of painful abdominal cramps. Although functional abdominal&#xD;
      pain is not life-threatening, it has significant impact on quality of life, functional&#xD;
      outcomes, and patient satisfaction. It is a major source of school and work absence, loss of&#xD;
      sleep, and extracurricular impairment. Despite this, analgesia has traditionally been&#xD;
      withheld from patients with acute abdominal pain. The reasons behind this are likely&#xD;
      two-fold. First, there is good evidence that clinicians fear that analgesia will mask signs&#xD;
      of an underlying surgical pathology such as appendicitis. There is no current published&#xD;
      literature that supports this practice. In fact, recent evidence has found that providing&#xD;
      analgesia to children does not obscure signs of an acute surgical abdomen nor lead to&#xD;
      clinically significant differences in negative outcomes. Second, there is no standard of care&#xD;
      specifying the best analgesic options for treating abdominal pain in children in the&#xD;
      post-codeine era. Although acetaminophen, ibuprofen, ketorolac, buscopan, and almagel/viscous&#xD;
      lidocaine are frequently used agents in the ED, evidence for their benefit in children with&#xD;
      functional abdominal pain is lacking. As a predictable result, most patients who present with&#xD;
      abdominal pain fail to experience pain relief at discharge. The importance of providing&#xD;
      optimal pain treatment is echoed by several national and international level policy&#xD;
      statements. In addition to the World Health Organization (WHO)'s mandate that adequate pain&#xD;
      treatment should be a fundamental human right, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has&#xD;
      reaffirmed its position that adequate analgesia be provided for children. Furthermore,&#xD;
      literature supports that providing analgesia improves patient care, caregiver satisfaction,&#xD;
      and the therapeutic relationship. Antispasmodics are commonly used agents to treat abdominal&#xD;
      cramping. Hyoscine butylbromide (HBB), trade name: Buscopan, is an anticholinergic agent that&#xD;
      when orally administered, does not cross the blood brain barrier and has minimal systemic&#xD;
      absorption. Therefore, it inhibits bowel motility without central nervous system or&#xD;
      peripheral side effects. This antispasmodic has been used in clinical practice for over 60&#xD;
      years and specifically has been on the market since 1952 for the treatment of abdominal&#xD;
      cramps. It is widely available around the world as both a prescription drug and an over the&#xD;
      counter medication in many industrialized countries. It has also been used safely in neonates&#xD;
      and children. As hyoscine butylbromide is barely absorbed, it is generally well tolerated. In&#xD;
      the two large-scale studies of almost 1200 patients that compared HBB with placebo (and&#xD;
      paracetamol), there was no significant difference in adverse events between the two groups,&#xD;
      including those commonly associated with anticholinergics, such as nausea, constipation, dry&#xD;
      mouth, blurred vision, tachycardia and urinary retention. Moreover, these adverse events not&#xD;
      only occurred at a low incidence (less than or equal to 1.5%) but were also usually mild and&#xD;
      self-limiting. In abdominal cramping and pain associated with irritable bowel syndrome,&#xD;
      systematic reviews have had conflicting results with regards to analgesic efficacy, primarily&#xD;
      because of small sample sizes and less rigorous designs. Muller-Krampe et al. conducted a&#xD;
      prospective cohort of over 200 children with both acute and chronic abdominal spasms and&#xD;
      compared the effectiveness of oral HBB 10 mg to a homeopathic preparation. HBB demonstrated&#xD;
      comparative improvements to the homeopathic preparation with respect to pain, sleep&#xD;
      disturbance, eating and drinking, and crying. Over 90% of patients in both groups reported&#xD;
      good tolerability and there were no adverse events. Although HBB is used widely for abdominal&#xD;
      pain in children and anecdotal evidence suggests it is efficacious, no paediatric clinical&#xD;
      trial to date has explored its efficacy in the ED setting. The investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      HBB will have superior efficacy to the most commonly used agent, acetaminophen for acute&#xD;
      abdominal pain in children. If HBB is found to be an effective analgesic in children with&#xD;
      acute abdominal pain, it could provide a therapeutic option for a common, painful condition&#xD;
      for which there is currently very little to offer.&#xD;
