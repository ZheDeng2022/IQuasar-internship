    <textblock>
      Influenza is an important cause of medical visits and worker absenteeism among healthy&#xD;
      adults. Studies of healthcare providers vaccination programmes have reported a positive&#xD;
      effect in lowering rates of influenza like illness and influenza related complication,&#xD;
      hospitalisation and death. Nurses should receive influenza vaccination so that those patients&#xD;
      who may come in contact with will not be infected by their nurses. However, the immunization&#xD;
      rate among nurses is constantly low. Therefore, it is important to develop an intervention&#xD;
      programmes to increase immunization of nurses. In some research on electronic text messaging&#xD;
      in promoting public health showed potential of this communication system in preventive health&#xD;
      behavioural change. With the use of this widely acceptable, accessible and convenient&#xD;
      approach of communication, reminders of receiving influenza vaccination are sent to nurses&#xD;
      involved in this study. At the same time, educational messages are sent to modify their&#xD;
      perception on the positive effect of influenza vaccination, and therefore, motivate the&#xD;
      nurses to receive the vaccination. The study will be conducted as a two-arm randomised&#xD;
      controlled trial which the control and intervention groups will run concurrently. Nurses of a&#xD;
      local hospital are invited to participate in this study. They will receive the usual&#xD;
      announcement on the information of free influenza vaccination of the hospital. The&#xD;
      participants of the intervention group will also receive text message reminders on details&#xD;
      for free influenza vaccine and educational information. All communication occurred through&#xD;
      secure, asynchronous electronic text messages. The reminders and educational information are&#xD;
      developed with reference to promotion messages from the Department of Health under the&#xD;
      framework of Health Belief Model so as to promote positive perception on influenza&#xD;
      vaccination by the participants. Participants are invited to complete the pre and post&#xD;
      questionnaires before and after the study period. The influenza vaccination status of the&#xD;
      participants and their perception on influenza vaccination will be obtained. It is&#xD;
      hypothesised that the participants receiving the reminders and educational information will&#xD;
      more likely to receive influenza vaccine and perceived the influenza vaccination as important&#xD;
      measure in protecting them from influenza. The participants of the intervention group will&#xD;
      also receptive to electronic text messaging communication and education.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Study aims to evaluate the efficacy of text messaging reminders in promoting influenza&#xD;
      vaccination among nurses in a Hong Kong local hospital. The primary outcome is the receipt of&#xD;
      influenza vaccine by end of February 2016 as reported by the participants. The secondary&#xD;
      outcomes include the proportion of participants seeking out influenza vaccination and the&#xD;
      proportion of participants of intervention group receptive to electronic text messaging&#xD;
      communication and education. According to a study by WHO in 2005, influenza vaccines offer&#xD;
      approximately 70-90% protection against clinical diseases in healthy adults. Despite the&#xD;
      recommendation suggested by the CHP of Hong Kong that vaccination should be received by the&#xD;
      high risks groups such as healthcare providers including nurses, vaccination rate of nurses&#xD;
      is remained low with the Annual Seasonal Influenza Uptake Rate at 14.41% in 2013 in Hong&#xD;
      Kong. This finding corresponded to those overseas studies that the influenza vaccine rate of&#xD;
      nurses was among the lowest of all healthcare providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although numerous interventions have been employed to promote Influenza vaccination, the cost&#xD;
      of these approaches are high whilst have not resulted in the large or long-lasting increase&#xD;
      that has been desired. Moreover, there are factors that inhibit nurses from receiving&#xD;
      vaccination. Studies showed that nurses perceived themselves low risk from influenza. Other&#xD;
      reasons such as misunderstanding and myths about influenza can be acquired from the vaccine,&#xD;
      concerns about the efficacy and side effects of vaccine, and lack of time or forgot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nurses also perceived there is absence of an immediate threat to their health, especially for&#xD;
      the younger nurses. Hence, tend not to seek out influenza vaccination. A study found that one&#xD;
      of the stipulated reasons nurses for choosing to be vaccinated against influenza was their&#xD;
      concern about spreading the disease to their patients if the nurses got influenza, which was&#xD;
      the second highest reason other than concern about getting influenza themselves. The findings&#xD;
      coherence with the caring nature of persons who entered nursing. Other findings also found&#xD;
      that recall system and educational information with the emphasis on recommended vaccination&#xD;
      are ranked as the second and third most effective strategies to improve or maintain&#xD;
      vaccination coverage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nowadays, using electronic reminder system is not new to nurses in Hong Kong. The&#xD;
      implementation of Clinical Dash Board was introduced about 10 years ago and has been used to&#xD;
      generate messages to alert nurses to deal with their varied unfinished clinical works as well&#xD;
      as appointment of the patients under their care. At the same time, mobile technologies were&#xD;
      considered by many to be the next frontier in health behaviour change because they were&#xD;
      considered to be the vehicles to deliver personal and adaptive health information anywhere in&#xD;
      real time. It is suggested by some researchers that electronic text messaging might hold a&#xD;
      more promising result in serving as a reminder. There is a growing body of researches on text&#xD;
      messaging for a range of health and mental health problems. However, none of these studies&#xD;
      reported on receiving text messages in promoting vaccination uptake of nurses, the single&#xD;
      largest group of healthcare providers who close encounter with people that are highly&#xD;
      susceptible to influenza and other upper respiratory diseases. It is the intention of this&#xD;
      study to look into the issue so as to evaluate the efficacy of text messaging reminders in&#xD;
      promoting influenza vaccination among nurses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects of the study included qualified nurses who are employed in a Hong Kong local&#xD;
      hospital, owned smart phones with electronic text messaging function, and are willing to&#xD;
      provide their active mobile telephone numbers. However, qualified nurses who have already&#xD;
      received influenza vaccination prior the commencement of vaccination period of 2015-16, or&#xD;
      who have history of allergies to egg, chicken proteins or neomycin or any component of&#xD;
      vaccine, or who have history of moderate to severe reaction to influenza vaccination, or who&#xD;
      have history of Guillain-Barré Syndrome will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As there is no randomised control trial study has been found from the literature that&#xD;
      evaluate the effect of text messaging on increase influenza vaccine uptake of nurses, similar&#xD;
      study with subject other than nurses was referred. With reference to other similar study, the&#xD;
      overall vaccination rate among participants of both control and intervention groups ranged&#xD;
      from 18.1% to 36.4% with the effect size of around 18%. Taking reference to the influenza&#xD;
      vaccination uptake rate of the local hospital which this study is intended to be carried out&#xD;
      was only 11.56% in the seasonal influenza period 2013-14, it is estimated that the&#xD;
      vaccination rate of nurses in the intervention group of the proposed study would be 17%.&#xD;
      Given α = 0.05, desired power = 0.8, by comparing two proportions, the number of subject in&#xD;
      each group should be at least 247. Allowing a drop-out rate of 25%, 329 subjects in each&#xD;
      group should be provided the desired power. Hence, a sample size with minimum of 658 shall be&#xD;
      recruited into this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon received the approval from the Research Ethics Committee of the Hospital, email will be&#xD;
      sent to the nurse managers of each department and ward of the local hospital to introduce the&#xD;
      study. Appointment will be made with the individual nurse manager regarding the appropriate&#xD;
      time to brief the nurses. It is planned to carry out the briefing session during the&#xD;
      recommended period where most of the nurses will be available to attend. The investigator&#xD;
      will provide verbal explanation and distribute the information sheets to the participants&#xD;
      prior to the commencement of data collection. Participants are encouraged to clarify any&#xD;
      queries related to the study. Participation in the study will be entirely voluntary and each&#xD;
      participant has the right to withdraw or refuse to give information at any time during the&#xD;
      study without incurring any penalties or deprivation of services. The purpose and procedure&#xD;
      of the study as well as the risks and benefits of participation will be explained. With this&#xD;
      understanding, the participants are invited to sign the written consent form. Attached with&#xD;
      it, a self-administered questionnaire will be given to the participants to complete. The&#xD;
      completed questionnaire can be returned to the investigator at the time of briefing. For&#xD;
      those who completed the post-intervention questionnaire by telephone interview, a message&#xD;
      will be texted to each of these subjects which can be used for redemption of a $10 cash&#xD;
      coupon from the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted with the respect for the individual participant in accordance&#xD;
      with the requirement of this study protocol and also the International Conference on&#xD;
      Harmonisation E6 Good Clinical Practice and all applicable laws and regulations, including&#xD;
      without limitation, data privacy laws, clinical trial disclosure laws, and regulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be recruited from November 2015 followed by data collection via pre and post&#xD;
      questionnaires survey by March 2016. A randomizer, who will not be involved in any part of&#xD;
      the study, will develop a randomised intervention allocation sequence using random block&#xD;
      sizes of two, four, and six. Sequentially numbered, opaque and sealed envelopes containing&#xD;
      assignment information will then be prepared and kept by the investigator who will&#xD;
      responsible for participant recruitment. When informed written consent is obtained, the&#xD;
      investigator will select the next envelope in the sequence to decide the intervention&#xD;
      allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study period, four electronic text messages will be sent to intervention group&#xD;
      participants. Messages contain educational information such as the fact that during epidemic,&#xD;
      nurses who are in close contact with high risk patients, are more likely to get an influenza&#xD;
      infection; vaccination reduces the personal risk of influenza illness and also reduces the&#xD;
      risk to infect patients and family members; by reducing the chance of sick leave due to&#xD;
      influenza-like illnesses, vaccination can in turn reduce work pressure; lastly it is also the&#xD;
      social expectation on the professional as well as personal responsibility of nurses in&#xD;
      protecting own selves and their patients from contacting influenza.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The text messages on reinforcing the fact that influenza is dangerous for the nurses and for&#xD;
      the patients will also mention. Therefore, any potential side effect is no reason for not&#xD;
      being vaccinated. Vaccination cannot cause influenza infection nor reduce immunity. Influenza&#xD;
      vaccine is a safe vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The messages will be sent to the intervention group participants on a weekly basis for 4&#xD;
      weeks. All communication occurred through a secure, asynchronous electronic text messages&#xD;
      apps. The education information is developed with reference to promotion messages from&#xD;
      Department of Health under the framework of health belief model which four constructs on&#xD;
      which individuals base their perceptions, namely perceived benefit, perceived barriers,&#xD;
      perceived susceptibility, and perceived seriousness of illness or threat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis will be started in April 2016 and by August 2016, report will be generated and&#xD;
      findings will be disseminated. A research assistant, who will not be involved in participant&#xD;
      recruitment and will be blinded to the participants' intervention allocation, is responsible&#xD;
      for the assessment of the study outcomes. The influenza vaccination status of the&#xD;
      participants will be obtained through telephone follow up by the research assistant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will be evaluated by quantitative method. All participants will be asked to&#xD;
      complete the questionnaires before and after the influenza season. The questionnaires will&#xD;
      include the participants' vaccination status, their perception on influenza vaccination,&#xD;
      their history of contacting influenza or experiencing influenza-like illnesses, and their&#xD;
      experience and perceptions of the effectiveness of the use of electronic text message&#xD;
      reminder in promoting health intervention. The study analyses will be conducted using SPSS&#xD;
      21.0. The significant level selected for all analyses was P ≤ 0.05. Descriptive baseline&#xD;
      characteristics of the groups were tabulated as means and standard deviations or proportions.&#xD;
      Differences in demographic characteristics between the intervention and control group will be&#xD;
      analysed using t-test for continuous data and chi-square tests for categorical data. The&#xD;
      primary concern of the study will compare the influenza vaccine uptake in the two study&#xD;
      groups. For the primary outcome on influenza vaccine uptake, the investigators will calculate&#xD;
      risk differences (RD) and relative risks (RR) with their corresponding 95% confidence&#xD;
      intervals (95%CI). The efficacy analysis will be performed in accordance with the&#xD;
      intention-to-treat principle that with missing data taken as no vaccination received.&#xD;
      Differences in the facilitators will also be compared, again using chi-square test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To protect the privacy of the participants, the data would be handled and stored by the&#xD;
      investigator in a confidential way during and after the completion of the study. All the data&#xD;
      set would be handled in line with Hospital's policy in handling, storage and destruction of&#xD;
      confidential records. They would be kept by the investigator in a cabinet with lock which is&#xD;
      located in her office. Electronic data would be saved in secured computer in the&#xD;
      investigator's office with restricted access. Access to the data would only be made with the&#xD;
      approval from the Principal Investigator, hence, confidentiality and anonymity will be&#xD;
      assured.&#xD;
