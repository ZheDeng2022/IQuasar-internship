  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pressure ulcers (PU) are skin breakdowns that often form after blood flow in the skin is&#xD;
      reduced from prolonged and repeated exposure to externally applied forces. As many as 85% of&#xD;
      individuals with a spinal cord injury (SCI) report the occurrence of at least 1 PU since&#xD;
      being injured. Despite the increasing attention and emphasis on prevention, PUs still&#xD;
      represent a major health risk for persons with SCI. Among the numerous potential physical&#xD;
      risk factors identified for the development of a PU were several conditions that have a&#xD;
      significant negative effect on skin blood flow. In addition, improper management of blood&#xD;
      sugar is a major risk factor for PU development and it impedes healing. It would appear that&#xD;
      hormones (i.e., chemical signals in the blood) associated with how the body uses sugar that&#xD;
      target the blood vessels may play an important role in the development and formation of a PU.&#xD;
      In persons with SCI, skin blood flow responses to insulin (i.e., a hormone that helps the&#xD;
      body use sugar and also relaxes the blood vessels allowing blood flow to increase) in the&#xD;
      lower extremity were shown to be much lower than healthy individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study in up to 30 individuals with chronic SCI and a difficult-to-heal pelvic&#xD;
      region PU has 2 phases: (1) a 4-week &quot;observation&quot; phase [if the PU does not heal&#xD;
      appropriately (determined by digital photos and software computation), and the subject is&#xD;
      found to be insulin resistant then they will progress to the next phase of the study] and (2)&#xD;
      an 8-week &quot;treatment&quot; phase. All participants will continue to receive the standard wound&#xD;
      care throughout the observation and treatment phases. If the surface area of the PU does not&#xD;
      decrease by more than 30% during the 4-week observation phase, the participant will be&#xD;
      eligible to enter the 8-week treatment phase, in which they will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      receive active drug (e.g., pioglitazone) or placebo. The participants will have four study&#xD;
      visits in which the following will be acquired: digital image of the wound to monitor wound&#xD;
      surface area, skin blood flow measurements of the peri-wound area, and blood tests to monitor&#xD;
      liver function, kidney function, blood sugar (hemoglobin A1C, insulin, glucose), nutritional&#xD;
      status (albumin and pre-albumin), a complete blood count with differential, and makers of&#xD;
      inflammation. Weekly monitoring of symptoms and participant experiences will be closely&#xD;
      monitored.&#xD;

      Pressure ulcers (PU) are skin breakdowns that often form after blood flow in the skin is&#xD;
      reduced from prolonged and repeated exposure to externally applied forces. As many as 85% of&#xD;
      individuals with a spinal cord injury (SCI) report the occurrence of at least 1 PU since&#xD;
      being injured. Despite the increasing attention and emphasis on prevention strategies, PUs&#xD;
      still represent a major risk for morbidity in persons with SCI. Among the numerous potential&#xD;
      physical risk factors identified for the development of a PU were several conditions that&#xD;
      have a significant adverse influences on skin blood flow. In addition, poor glycemic control&#xD;
      is a major risk factor for PU development and it impedes healing. Thus, it would appear that&#xD;
      vasoactive hormones associated with carbohydrate metabolism that target the endothelium may&#xD;
      play an important role in the development and formation of a PU. In persons with SCI, skin&#xD;
      blood flow responses to insulin in the lower extremity were shown to be much lower than&#xD;
      healthy individuals despite no clinical signs of insulin resistance. In the skin next to a&#xD;
      PU, the current proposal will determine if a once-daily treatment with pioglitazone for 8&#xD;
      weeks improves skin blood flow after insulin by iontophoresis.&#xD;
