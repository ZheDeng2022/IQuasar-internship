  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be an 8 week, multicenter, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial. The&#xD;
      screening visit will be divided into two parts, a &quot;pre-screen&quot; in-clinic rapid lipid test&#xD;
      (Cholestech) followed by a full screening blood draw to be sent to the central reference&#xD;
      laboratory (CRL) for subjects meeting the Cholestech inclusion values for TG and LDL (see&#xD;
      inclusion criteria below) on the pre-screen test. Subjects who do not meet the pre-screen&#xD;
      criteria will be discharged from further participation in the study. Subjects must have&#xD;
      pre-screen lipid values of LDL &gt;/=70 mg/dl and triglyceride (TG) &gt;/=180 and &lt;/=499. Subjects&#xD;
      who meet these Cholestech criteria will have blood drawn for central reference laboratory&#xD;
      (CRL) screening testing. For randomization, 80% of the subjects must have TG&gt;/=200 mg/dl to&#xD;
      proceed to the next screening step while up to 20% will be allowed to proceed to the next&#xD;
      screening step with TG=150-199 mg/dl as long as the LDL is&gt;/=70 mg/dl. Subjects who meet the&#xD;
      CRL pre-screen lipid inclusion criteria will return 2-14 days later for the remainder of the&#xD;
      full screening procedures. Subjects who meet all screening criteria will be randomized at&#xD;
      this visit. Thus, the prescreening and screening-1 visits will occur at the same time and the&#xD;
      screening 2 visit will also be the baseline visit. BMI will be calculated but is not a&#xD;
      criterion for participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who meet all inclusion and exclusion requirements at the screening 2/baseline visit&#xD;
      will be randomized to receive one of the two (2) study products. Randomization will proceed&#xD;
      in groups of 5 with 4 subjects having TG between 200-499 mg/dl before randomizing a subject&#xD;
      with TG between 150-199 mg/dl. Subjects will return for evaluation 4 and 8 weeks after the&#xD;
      baseline visit at which times adverse events (AEs) will be recorded, blood lipid studies will&#xD;
      be done and subjects will complete a VAS for product tolerability. Laboratory studies will be&#xD;
      drawn after subjects have been sitting for at least 5 minutes.&#xD;
