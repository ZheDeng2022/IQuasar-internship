      The objective of this study is to compare the effectiveness of Fortiva Porcine Dermis versus&#xD;
      Strattice Reconstructive Tissue Matrix for the underlay reinforcement of complex ventral&#xD;
      hernia repair and assess post-operative complication rates, long term hernia recurrence&#xD;
      rates.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, prospective, double-blinded study evaluating the efficacy of Fortiva&#xD;
      Porcine Dermis versus Strattice Reconstructive Tissue Matrix in 120 patients with large&#xD;
      complex abdominal wall ventral hernias undergoing single stage repair. The patient will be&#xD;
      blinded to treatment as well as an independent qualified evaluator to confirm evidence of&#xD;
      reoccurrence. This post-market study compares two FDA cleared biologic hernia materials.&#xD;
      Fortiva™ porcine dermis, processed by RTI Surgical, Inc., a non-cross linked porcine dermis&#xD;
      will be compared to Strattice™ Reconstructive Tissue Matrix by Life Cell, a non-cross linked&#xD;
      porcine dermis for reinforcement during the single stage open reconstruction of abdominal&#xD;
      wall defects. The primary outcome will be hernia recurrence at 1 year. Outcomes will be&#xD;
      evaluated at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months and 24 months.&#xD;
