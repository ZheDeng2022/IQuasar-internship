        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is, in the investigator(s) opinion, willing and able to comply with the&#xD;
             protocol requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has given voluntary written informed consent before performance of any&#xD;
             study-related procedure not part of normal medical care, with the understanding that&#xD;
             consent may be withdrawn by the patient at any time without prejudice to their future&#xD;
             medical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patient is either post-menopausal or surgically sterilized or willing to use&#xD;
             two acceptable methods of birth control (i.e., a hormonal contraceptive, intrauterine&#xD;
             device, diaphragm with spermicide, condom with spermicide, or abstinence) for the&#xD;
             duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male patient agrees to use an acceptable method for contraception (i.e., condom or&#xD;
             abstinence) for the duration of the study.&#xD;

             admitted to this study will be oligo- or non-secretory MM with free light chains only&#xD;
