  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is now recognized that diet plays a critical role in the etiology and management of the&#xD;
      chronic diseases such as diabetes, obesity and cardiovascular disease. A high consumption of&#xD;
      fat, especially saturated fat, is an established risk factor for Cardiovascular Disease.The&#xD;
      glycaemic index (GI) is a measurement of the ability of different types of carbohydrate-based&#xD;
      foods to raise blood glucose. The interest in low GI food as a weight management tool has&#xD;
      been increasing. Different types of carbohydrates differ in their ability to increase&#xD;
      postprandial blood glucose and insulin secretion, and may also modulate the effect of&#xD;
      different fatty acids. The current study will compare the consumption of low and high GI&#xD;
      carbohydrate with different fat saturation on postprandial glucose, insulin, and&#xD;
      triacylglycerol responses in healthy participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data generated will have direct applications in public health policy and clinical&#xD;
      nutrition management of chronic disease. The outcomes of the study will significantly&#xD;
      contribute to the long term national goals of Singapore to manage and to reduce the incidence&#xD;
      of chronic disease associated with the metabolic syndrome.&#xD;

      This study will be conducted using a randomized, crossover design with six dietary phases: a&#xD;
      low GI meal or a high GI meal with saturated fat, monounsaturated fat or polyunsaturated fat.&#xD;
      All participants will be randomly allocated to the six test meals, with the order balanced.&#xD;
      Fifteen participants aged between 21 and 40 years will be recruited from the general public&#xD;
      in Singapore. During the testing session, a maximum of eleven blood samples will be collected&#xD;
      by fingerpricks and cannulation. Fingerpricks and cannulation may cause minor discomfort and&#xD;
      there may be some slight bruising around the site. Fingerpricks and cannulation will be done&#xD;
      by an experienced research nurse or a trained research officer to minimize participant&#xD;
      discomfort. If bruising does occur, it should disappear within one day and it should not&#xD;
      affect participants' regular daily activity. Participants will be limited to a maximum of two&#xD;
      tests per week. In addition, blood collection will be carried out in a sterile designated&#xD;
      area and thus the risk of infection will be very low. On rare occasions, participants may&#xD;
      feel unwell during or after the testing session. The investigators have several metabolic&#xD;
      suites with beds for these individuals to rest on. The research nurse and research officers&#xD;
      will monitor the individuals' condition and they will be provided with a ride home if&#xD;
      required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the study foods will be prepared in a hygienic manner in a purpose-built research kitchen&#xD;
      maintained to the highest hygiene standards. The research staff has undergone basic training&#xD;
      in food hygiene procedures. Hence, the risk of infective acute gastroenteritis will be&#xD;
      minimal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of dietary interventions have aimed to investigate the effect of dietary fat quality&#xD;
      on glucose, insulin and lipidemia response. Up to now there have been few studies connect the&#xD;
      glycaemic load and fat quality together. The investigators study's results will help public&#xD;
      choose fat quality and carbohydrate quality in the diet. Participants will be provided with&#xD;
      some snacks at the end of each testing session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, participants will be provided with their blood glucose, blood insulin, blood&#xD;
      lipid profile, blood pressure, and body composition results, with a brief interpretation of&#xD;
      these at the conclusion of the study.&#xD;
