      Background: Accurate diagnosis of small gastric subepithelial tumors (SETs) is essential in&#xD;
      order to assess their malignant potential. Endoscopic unroofing by conventional snare or&#xD;
      needle knife has been reported to yield sufficient tissue samples for histological evaluation&#xD;
      including immunohistochemical staining.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims: The investigators aim to evaluate endoscopic unroofing in patients with small gastric&#xD;
      SETs regarding its safety and diagnostic accuracy as well as a potential therapeutic effect&#xD;
      of this technique over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: In the context of a retrospective analysis, the investigators will identify patients&#xD;
      who underwent endoscopic unroofing of small SETs of the stomach at the Medical University of&#xD;
      Vienna. Demographic data, indication for intervention, safety of the procedure and follow-up&#xD;
      will be assessed.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Small gastric subepithelial tumors (SETs) are often incidental findings at upper endoscopy.&#xD;
      Differential diagnoses include a variety of different pathologies such as gastrointestinal&#xD;
      stromal tumors (GISTs), leiomyomas, leiomyosarcomas, lipomas, carcinoid tumors, granular cell&#xD;
      tumors, duplication cysts or pancreatic rests. Since some of these entities have a potential&#xD;
      of malignancy, accurate classification of gastric SETs is essential to define the best&#xD;
      diagnostic and therapeutic management. Endosonography (EUS) is the current gold standard for&#xD;
      further characterization of small gastric SETs. It provides differentiation between extra-&#xD;
      and intramural lesions, information on the involvement of certain wall layers, measurement of&#xD;
      a lesion as well as structural analysis according to the echogenicity of a lesion.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, a level of uncertainty remains, even if a lesion shows a typical echo-pattern&#xD;
      and layer involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to current guidelines, lesions of more than two centimeters in size that are&#xD;
      suspected to be GISTs should be removed by surgical resection. Lesions less than one&#xD;
      centimeter can be followed by annual EUS. For lesions bigger than one centimeter but smaller&#xD;
      than two centimeters tissue sampling is recommended in order to correctly diagnose a lesion&#xD;
      according to immunohistochemical markers (such as CD117 or CD34 in GISTs) and to quantify the&#xD;
      malignant potential according to other histological factors (such as the mitotic index in&#xD;
      GISTs) [1].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tissue sampling can be done by using standard or jumbo forceps biopsy and EUS-guided fine&#xD;
      needle aspiration or biopsy, but the diagnostic yield of these methods is rather low [2,3].&#xD;
      Better results can be achieved by endoscopic resection techniques such as endoscopic&#xD;
      submucosal dissection (ESD), submucosal tunneling endoscopic resection or full thickness&#xD;
      endoscopic resection [4,5]. The main advantage of these approaches is that they are not only&#xD;
      diagnostic but also therapeutic strategies since the respective lesion can be resected as a&#xD;
      whole comparable with conventional surgery. However, there is a high risk of procedure&#xD;
      related adverse events such as bleeding or perforation (the latter is often unavoidable&#xD;
      considering that most SETs are arising from deep wall layers such as the muscularis propria&#xD;
      layer).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endoscopic unroofing is very similar to the mentioned endoscopic resection techniques with&#xD;
      the main difference that only partial resection is intended in order to get a representative&#xD;
      tissue specimen for histological evaluation. This method has been described in a case series&#xD;
      by Lee et al. in 2010 where it showed a very favorable diagnostic yield in gastric SETs [6].&#xD;
      To date, no study has reported on the follow-up of lesions investigated by endoscopic&#xD;
      unroofing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is to evaluate endoscopic unroofing for small gastric SETs&#xD;
      regarding safety, diagnostic yield and potential therapeutic effects over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY HYPOTHESIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endoscopic unroofing has a high diagnostic accuracy in small gastric subepithelial tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      This retrospective study will be conducted at the Division of Gastroenterology and&#xD;
      Hepatology, Department of Internal Medicine III. Of the Medical University of Vienna.&#xD;
      Patients who underwent endoscopic unroofing of gastric subepithelial tumors between 2000 and&#xD;
      2015 will be identified by searching the endoscopy reporting database &quot;DOKMON&quot;. Clinical data&#xD;
      will be collected from patients identified by reviewing endoscopy examination reports as well&#xD;
      as other clinical documents including discharge letters in the report archiving database&#xD;
      &quot;AKIM&quot;. The following parameters will be assessed: Demographics (age, sex), indication for&#xD;
      endoscopic unroofing, intraprocedural adverse events, hospital stay, histological result,&#xD;
      follow-up procedures (including endoscopic or imaging controls, surgical resection). At the&#xD;
      end of the study the mentioned parameters will be presented using descriptive statistics.&#xD;
      Data analysis will be performed using SPSS 23.0. All patient related data will be&#xD;
      de-identified using pseudonymization prior to any further processing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators expect to encounter approximately 20 patients into this study (between 2000&#xD;
      and 2015).&#xD;
