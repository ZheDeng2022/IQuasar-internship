    <description>This phase will investigate two different dosing schedules of AZD2014: a continuous daily schedule (CC-Schedule) and an intermittent schedule of 2 days on and 5 days off treatment (IC-Schedule). The dose of Selumetinib (AZD6244) will remain unchanged in both schedules. The outcome of this investigation will determine whether an additional schedule of combined intermittent Selumetinib (AZD6244) (3 days on and 4 days off treatment) with intermittent AZD2014 will be considered (II-Schedule). The II-Schedule will be initiated following the completion of the corresponding continuous regimens and will only be investigated if escalation of the AZD2014 dose in the IC-Schedule is not feasible with the corresponding continuous Selumetinib (AZD6244) regimen. Up to three individual dose levels of Selumetinib (AZD6244) might subsequently be explored within the intermittent schedule of Selumetinib (AZD6244).</description>

    <description>AZD2014 is a dual inhibitor of both mTORC1 (rapamycin-sensitive) and mTORC2 (rapamycin insensitive); compared to rapalogues, AZD2014 has a broader range of growth inhibitory activity in preclinical models based on a more profound mTORC1 inhibition and the additional inhibition of mTORC2. AZD2014 is currently in phase 2 studies in renal cell cancers and metastatic breast cancer.</description>
