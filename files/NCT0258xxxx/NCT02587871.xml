    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well donor cellular therapy after cytarabine works in&#xD;
      treating patients with intermediate-risk acute myeloid leukemia with a decrease in or&#xD;
      disappearance of signs and symptoms of cancer. Donor cellular therapy is a short-term&#xD;
      transfusion of cells from a family member who is incompletely matched. The use of these&#xD;
      partially matched white blood cells may help improve response to standard chemotherapy&#xD;
      (cytarabine) and reduce some of the risks of infection, without a permanent transplant. Drugs&#xD;
      used in chemotherapy, such as cytarabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer&#xD;
      cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from&#xD;
      spreading. Giving donor cellular therapy after cytarabine may kill more cancer cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess 2-year disease-free survival (as defined by time to death from any cause or&#xD;
      disease relapse, whichever is earlier) for patients &lt; 60 years of age with intermediate-risk&#xD;
      acute myeloid leukemia (AML), in complete remission (CR) after induction chemotherapy, who&#xD;
      receive microtransplantation, compared to patients who received consolidation chemotherapy&#xD;
      only in a historical published comparable cohort of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To obtain estimates of rate of relapse, treatment related mortality (TRM), all cause&#xD;
      mortality, in the microtransplantation (MST) group and compare it with allogeneic stem cell&#xD;
      group (historical cohort).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To obtain estimates of rate acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), chronic GVHD, time to&#xD;
      recovery of absolute neutrophil counts and platelets in patients with intermediate risk AML&#xD;
      receiving of chemotherapy in combination with microtransplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Presence or absence of detectable donor chimerism post-microtransplantation until 6 months&#xD;
      after the last infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Characteristics of the infused cells and composition of the graft. III. Dynamics of&#xD;
      T-cell clonality. IV. Immune cell subset analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 4-6 weeks after completion of induction chemotherapy, patients receive&#xD;
      cytarabine intravenously (IV) over 1-3 hours twice daily (BID) on days -7 to -2 and&#xD;
      granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) mobilized peripheral blood cells&#xD;
      (microtransplant) IV over 15-20 minutes on day 0. Treatment repeats every 8-10 weeks for 3&#xD;
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at least every 3 months for 2&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
