  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease is a common, disabling, progressive condition characterised by severe&#xD;
      problems with movement for which medical treatment in the longer term can be unsatisfactory.&#xD;
      Deep brain stimulation is a treatment, which directly stimulates the nerve cells affected&#xD;
      inside the brain to help overcome the difficulties with movement. Classically, deep brain&#xD;
      stimulation stimulates in a manner that is constant and independent of a patients underlying&#xD;
      condition as reflected in their brainwave activity. Recent research has suggested that&#xD;
      adjusting deep brain stimulation in real time using analyses of brain signals recorded from&#xD;
      deep brain stimulation electrodes (termed closed loop deep brain stimulation) nay be better&#xD;
      than classical deep brain stimulation in alleviating difficulties with movement. However, it&#xD;
      remains unclear whether closed-loop deep brain stimulation also leads to fewer unwanted side&#xD;
      effects on movement control. In order to answer this question, the investigators will analyze&#xD;
      deep brain stimulation activity and activity recorded from the surface of the head in&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease patients undergoing deep brain stimulation surgery. During the recordings&#xD;
      patients will perform different movement tasks. Deep brain stimulation has been found to&#xD;
      reduce patients' ability to suppress inappropriate movements in certain tasks and performance&#xD;
      in these tasks will be the core point of interest. The recordings will be conducted three&#xD;
      times: During closed loop deep brain stimulation, classical deep brain stimulation and while&#xD;
      the stimulator is turned off. This will allow the investigators to assess putative&#xD;
      differences in the effect of closed loop and classical deep brain stimulation with regards to&#xD;
      wanted and unwanted effects on movement control and to elucidate their correlates in the&#xD;
      brain.&#xD;

      Study Summary Patients will undergo standard 2 part deep brain stimulation implantation&#xD;
      (electrode implantation day 1, battery and stimulator implantation approximately day 7, home&#xD;
      approximately day 10). The experiments will be performed whilst the patients are inpatients&#xD;
      between the two operations and will therefore not require any extra visits or delay in&#xD;
      starting therapeutic deep brain stimulation. This paradigm is the standard method for&#xD;
      conducting local field potential research in human and represents the paradigm by which the&#xD;
      vast majority of previous research in this area has been conducted. Patients will be tested&#xD;
      either at Oxford University Hospitals National Health Service Trust or University College&#xD;
      London National Health Service Trust.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At least 24h after electrode implantation (first of the two surgeries) patients will be&#xD;
      approached about the study and left with the patient information sheet for 24 hours, before&#xD;
      further discussion, and, if appropriate consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thereafter, the following procedures will be undertaken:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The subjects will participate in a short assessment testing their cognitive function and&#xD;
           fill out questionnaires regarding handedness and impulsiveness traits . Furthermore,&#xD;
           they will be introduced to the three motor tasks, which they will perform during the&#xD;
           definitive test. Together, these assessments will take approximately one hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Prior to the next steps, which will be conducted on the same day or 1-3 days&#xD;
           later(depending on the preferences of the participant), participants will be requested&#xD;
           to withhold their usual medication overnight so that they are assessed off medication on&#xD;
           the morning of the tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Deep brain stimulation will be evaluated in order to find the best stimulation&#xD;
           parameters ( the settings, which yield the best clinical benefit) for each individual&#xD;
           patient. This will take approximately 1 hour and is part of the standard clinical&#xD;
           procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Recordings will be made from the deep brain stimulation electrodes and electrodes placed&#xD;
           on the surface of the head in order to assess activity and communication within the&#xD;
           brain. During the recordings participants will perform three motor tasks using their&#xD;
           hands. In the first two tasks they have to decide whether to press a button on a&#xD;
           computer mouse or refrain from a response depending on the nature of some small dots&#xD;
           moving in different directions on a computer screen. This will allow assessing patients'&#xD;
           ability to perform and inhibit movements. In the third task they are asked to press a&#xD;
           button depending on the direction of an arrow presented in the middle of the screen,&#xD;
           while ignoring arrows around this central cue. This additional task will allow assessing&#xD;
           patients' ability to control conflicting response tendencies. The recordings will be&#xD;
           conducted three times: During closed loop deep brain stimulation, open loop deep brain&#xD;
           stimulation and while the stimulator is turned off. The order of these sessions will be&#xD;
           randomized and counter-balanced across participants. The experimental recordings will&#xD;
           take approximately 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to recordings we will assess motor impairment using a validated clinical score and&#xD;
      patients will have the opportunity to familiarize themselves with the motor tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Completion of the recordings will mark the end of an individual's participation in the study.&#xD;
      Given the overall duration of the study patients will be offered the opportunity to complete&#xD;
      the recordings after overnight withdrawal of dopaminergic medication over two days or on one&#xD;
      single day if preferred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thereafter the patient will have their stimulator implanted as usual (most often 7 days after&#xD;
      the first operation) and they will be discharged on day 9 - 10 according to their clinical&#xD;
      recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients with already implanted pacemakers, suitable participants will be identified by&#xD;
      the Functional Neurosurgery team who follow the clinical care of the patients. The invitation&#xD;
      letter and information sheet will be provided by the clinical team on behalf of the&#xD;
      researchers. If patients are interested, they would then be asked to contact the researchers.&#xD;
      The same assessments as above (rating scales, motor tasks) will be conducted on one single&#xD;
      day in the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, London.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Externalisation of electrode wires. The externalisation of the electrode wires will be&#xD;
      performed by trained neurosurgeons. This will occur in the awake patient under local&#xD;
      anaesthetic (or under a brief general anaesthetic if independent assessment of the patient's&#xD;
      clinical state by an anaesthetist determines this to be necessary) in the neurosurgical&#xD;
      department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single blinded counterbalanced within-subject trial. Patients will undergo closed loop deep&#xD;
      brain stimulation, open loop deep brain stimulation and a session without deep brain&#xD;
      stimulation whilst performing motor tasks. Local field potential and electroencephalographic&#xD;
      activity will be simultaneously recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Closed loop deep brain stimulation will be delivered through a portable battery operated&#xD;
      electronic device connected to the externalised leads. This incorporates an amplifier that&#xD;
      allows brain waves to be recorded during deep brain stimulation, a controller and a&#xD;
      stimulator. The controller is a simple rectifier and level detector, which then operates a&#xD;
      switch that allows stimulation. The level detector is adjusted so that deep brain stimulation&#xD;
      is only allowed when a certain clinician determined threshold of pathological brain wave&#xD;
      activity is exceeded. The stimulator supplies stimulation at a frequency of 130 Hertz and a&#xD;
      voltage as used for standard clinical stimulation. The device weighs about 350 grams and is&#xD;
      most simply carried in a small shoulder bag, or attached to a belt.&#xD;
