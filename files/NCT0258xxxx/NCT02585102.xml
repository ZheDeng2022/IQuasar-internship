  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if perceived barriers to vegetable consumption can be&#xD;
      overcome by making it easier for people eat more vegetables and to see if the effects last&#xD;
      over time.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      High vegetable consumption is associated with maintenance of a healthy body weight. Americans&#xD;
      do not eat vegetables in the amounts recommended by the dietary guidelines and interventions&#xD;
      to increase intake have had limited results. Reported barriers to consumption include not&#xD;
      knowing how to prepare them and being unused to eating them.To get people to eat vegetables,&#xD;
      they have to be motivated to do so. Repeated consumption of snack foods increases overweight&#xD;
      and obese individuals' motivation to eat snack foods. The investigators hypothesize that by&#xD;
      increasing people's consumption of vegetables by making them easy to eat will increase the&#xD;
      motivation value of vegetables. For this study the investigators propose to provide&#xD;
      minimally-processed (cleaned, packaged) vegetables to overweight and obese individuals. The&#xD;
      motivating value of vegetables will be measured using a computer task where people play a&#xD;
      game to earn points towards portions of a vegetable or a neutral food (crackers). The&#xD;
      investigators will determine potential moderators of the increase in the motivating value of&#xD;
      vegetables such as genetics (single nucleotide polymorphisms) that are associated with the&#xD;
      motivating value of food and whether people substitute eating vegetables for other foods. The&#xD;
      investigators will also determine changes in adiposity as a result of vegetable consumption.&#xD;
      Lastly, the investigators will determine if repeated consumption increases psychosocial&#xD;
      predictors of vegetable intake, such as self-efficacy of eating vegetables.&#xD;
