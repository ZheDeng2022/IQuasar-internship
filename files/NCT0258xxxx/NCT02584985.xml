  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Standard surgical treatment of mid and low rectal cancer is total mesorectal excision (TME).&#xD;
      Originally performed by open surgery, TME demonstrated improved local control and reduced&#xD;
      urogenital morbidity. Laparoscopic approach has been validated by several randomised&#xD;
      controlled trials: laparoscopic approach offers to the patient a better post-operative&#xD;
      recovery, a lower risk of wound hernia and comparable oncological results. However, the risk&#xD;
      of conversion to open procedure remains significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endoscopic Transanal Proctectomy allows retrograd mesorectal excision, performing the whole&#xD;
      pelvic dissection via a specific-moderate cost device. The procedure is then completed by a&#xD;
      briefer transabdominal laparoscopic step to mobilise the colon and perform inferior&#xD;
      mesenteric vessels ligation, prior to low coloanal anastomosis. The originality of this&#xD;
      approach is to perform a surgical dissection via an extra peritoneal route, without&#xD;
      peritoneal and abdominal wound trauma. This focuses on new technical improvement in the area&#xD;
      of mini-invasive pelviabdominal surgery using natural orifice as surgical access. This&#xD;
      approach offer closer and better exposure of pelvic dissection plane and could improve&#xD;
      oncological quality and pelvic nerve preservation. It could be profitable to postoperative&#xD;
      patient outcome. However rates and type of cancer-recurrences as well as functional results&#xD;
      have to be assessed in a controlled study. This technique has shown to be feasible and&#xD;
      reproducible through early clinical series. Conversion rates appear to be lower than&#xD;
      published rates of laparoscopic approach, markedly inferior to 10%. Compiled rates of&#xD;
      morbidity (27.8%), R1 resection* (6%), mesorectum macroscopic integrity (100%) appear to be&#xD;
      comparable to laparoscopic approach results. However functional results as well as urologic&#xD;
      morbidity have to be evaluated in comparative studies. In a preliminary retrospective&#xD;
      comparative (n=72) we founded comparable oncological quality criteria (R1 resection 5.9% vs&#xD;
      10.5% p 0.74, Grade 3 mesorectal integrity 57.5 vs 56.2 p 0.99), lower conversion rate to&#xD;
      open procedure (2.9% vs 23.6% p 0.011), shorter in-hospital stay (8 vs 9 days p 0.038).&#xD;
      Comparable morbidity rates (Dindo 1-4 27% vs 34% p 0.52) and functional results (Kirwan 1/2&#xD;
      80.3% vs 80.6% p 0.94) were also founded. These data need to be confirmed. To this date,&#xD;
      Endoscopic Transanal Proctectomy has been evaluated through preliminary studies including&#xD;
      several short series demonstrating the feasibility of the technique and showing low&#xD;
      morbidity. For some authors the benefit of transanal approach is significant in difficult&#xD;
      cases such as male patient and narrow pelvis. Very recently, two non randomised comparative&#xD;
      studies were published with conclusions close to those in our study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators propose, with the support of the GRECCAR group, to conduct a national,&#xD;
      multicenter, open-label randomized study based on oncological non-inferiority (R1 resection&#xD;
      rate) for the main objective, comparing Endoscopic Transanal Proctectomy to Standard&#xD;
      Transabdominal Laparoscopic Proctectomy, for low lying rectal cancer requiring manual&#xD;
      colo-anal anastomosis. There is a clear expected benefit expected for the patients through&#xD;
      the ETAP procedure in term of post operative short term outcome, risk of conversion to open&#xD;
      procedure, risk of wound hernia.This trial could also show significant advantages in terms of&#xD;
      quality of dissection, quality of the specimen, quality of nerve preservation.&#xD;

      The main objective of study is to assess if R1 resection rate of Endoscopic Transanal&#xD;
      Proctectomy (ETAP) is not meaningfully inferior to Standard Laparoscopic TME for low lying&#xD;
      rectal cancer requiring manual colo-anal anastomosis. The secondary objective will evaluate&#xD;
      conversion rate, mini invasive level of abdominal approach postoperative morbidity, In&#xD;
      hospital length of stay, Mesorectum macroscopic assessment, Functional urologic and sexual&#xD;
      results, Fecal Continency, global QoL, stoma-free survival, disease-free survival at 3 years.&#xD;
      Patients with non metastatic rectal adenocarcinoma requiring coloanal anastomosis will be&#xD;
      considered for the study. Based on the non-inferiority hypothesis, the population estimated&#xD;
      in this study at 226 patients, 113 for each arm. Inclusion period will be 3 years, the study&#xD;
      will be running for 6 years.&#xD;
