  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During surgery, there is a risk that food or liquid in the stomach might be forced back up&#xD;
      the throat where it could enter the lungs (aspirate) and result in serious complications or&#xD;
      even death. This is why people going for surgery are required not to eat before their&#xD;
      surgery. However, in emergency situations it is often not possible to know whether a patient&#xD;
      has recently eaten or not. Anesthesiologists have recently developed an ultrasound test to&#xD;
      determine if there is content in a patient's stomach and how much. This test involves an&#xD;
      ultrasound examination of the abdomen and taking some measurements on the ultrasound screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine how accurate these measurements are. In other&#xD;
      words, how good are we at detecting an empty stomach from one that has liquids, or solids in&#xD;
      it. You are being asked to participate in this study because we require non-pregnant&#xD;
      volunteers in order to answer the aforementioned study question.&#xD;
