    <textblock>
      The purpose of this 12-week, prospective study is to determine the effects of oral&#xD;
      supplementation with AyuFlex® (an over-the-counter dietary supplement) on joint mobility,&#xD;
      joint comfort and functional capacity in healthy overweight subjects.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This interventional study is a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo and dose-response&#xD;
      controlled clinical trial (in 3 parallel groups) of male and female subjects without active&#xD;
      osteoarthritis of the knee to be recruited at a single investigational center in the U.S. A&#xD;
      two-week placebo lead-in period will precede the study to enhance statistical power.&#xD;
      One-hundred and five (105) overweight, apparently healthy subjects, pre-screened using health&#xD;
      history questionnaires, vital signs, blood work and a standardized lower extremity exercise&#xD;
      performance test will be randomized to one of three groups for 84 days: placebo, AyuFlex1&#xD;
      (500 mg/d) or AyuFlex2 (1000 mg/d). AyuFlex is an organic, non-GMO, over-the-counter joint&#xD;
      health product derived from the edible fruits of Terminalia chebula.&#xD;
