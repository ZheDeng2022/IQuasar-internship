      The aim of this pilot study was to investigate whether the use of a multimodal protocol of&#xD;
      preoperative care plus preoperative immune nutrition would decrease the length of stay and&#xD;
      acute phase inflammation in patients submitted to total hip arthroplasty (THA). The study was&#xD;
      designed to be randomized and controlled, but not double blind. The patients were randomized&#xD;
      to receive either preoperative care based on evidence plus immune nutrition for 5 days prior&#xD;
      to surgery (Acerto group) or traditional preoperative care (control group). Main endpoints&#xD;
      were length of stay and acute-phase postoperative response&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A large broad of evidence has shown that traditional perioperative care have a weak&#xD;
      scientific basis and needs to be changed. Multimodal or fast-track protocols of perioperative&#xD;
      care for abdominal surgery have been associated with lower morbidity, lower costs and faster&#xD;
      postoperative recovery when compared to traditional care . Similarly the prescription of&#xD;
      perioperative immune nutrition for 5-7 days before major abdominal surgery may decrease the&#xD;
      risk of infections and reduce postoperative length of stay (LOS). Interestingly there is lack&#xD;
      of studies on multimodal protocols of enhanced recovery and on immune nutrition in elective&#xD;
      total hip arthroplasty (THA). In Brazil, the ACERTO (an acronym in Portuguese for&#xD;
      acceleration of postoperative recovery) protocol is a multimodal protocol of perioperative&#xD;
      care that includes: shortening of preoperative fasting with carbohydrates (CHO)-rich drinks&#xD;
      up to 2h before surgery, restriction of intravenous fluids and early postoperative re-feeding&#xD;
      and mobilization. Recently as a dynamic protocol the Acerto protocol included the&#xD;
      recommendation of perioperative immune nutrition. All the elements of the protocol are based&#xD;
      on evidence and are recommended by various international guidelines and consensus. Thus, the&#xD;
      aim of this pilot study was to investigate whether the use of the Acerto multimodal protocol&#xD;
      plus preoperative immune nutrition would decrease the length of stay and acute phase&#xD;
      inflammation in patients submitted to THA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS This was a prospective randomized pilot study. All procedures were performed at São&#xD;
      Mateus Hospital (Cuiabá, Brazil) from May 2012 to February 2013. The study was approved by&#xD;
      the Research Ethics Committee of the Júlio Müller University Hospital (Federal University of&#xD;
      Mato Grosso) and all patients signed a term of informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion and exclusion criteria. The investigators included adult patients of both sex&#xD;
      having a hip osteoarthrosis and candidates of elective THA. Patients were excluded if they&#xD;
      had fasting glycemia greater than 200mg/dl; acquired immunodeficiency (AIDS); renal failure&#xD;
      (creatinin above 2 mg/dl); cirrhosis; moderate or serious Alzheimer's disease (clinical&#xD;
      dementia rating score between 2 and 3); an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score&#xD;
      higher than 2; previous spinal surgery (arthrodesis) or THA (reviewing or changing the&#xD;
      prosthetic); and severe malnutrition (history of loss of 10% of body weight over the last 6&#xD;
      months). The investigators also excluded patients who did not have their blood samples taken&#xD;
      at the scheduled time and those who broke perioperative protocol, e.g. the non-intake of the&#xD;
      immune supplement in the Acerto group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design of the study. Patients were consecutively included and randomized into two groups:&#xD;
      Group Control and ACERTO group with the aid of electronic software of random numbers&#xD;
      available at www.graphpad.com. All patients were assessed by a multidisciplinary team, who&#xD;
      carried out a nutrition assessment, preoperative education, and collected the relevant&#xD;
      anthropometric, biochemical and clinical data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthesia and operative technique. Antibiotic prophylaxis was done with 2g of intravenous&#xD;
      kefazolin at the time of anesthetic induction. Measures were taken against postoperative&#xD;
      nausea and vomiting (PONV) according to the protocol applied by the anesthesia team and will&#xD;
      be discussed in this paper. Preoperative sedation was done with intravenous midazolam (0.03&#xD;
      to 0.1mg/kg) and propofol (30 to 60 mcg/kg/min) No general anesthetic was applied in both&#xD;
      groups. All subjects received epidural neuro-axis blockage at L3-L4 space with ropivacain&#xD;
      7.5% to 10% (150-200mg) and morphine chlorate 2mg (30 to 50 micrograms/kg). The surgical&#xD;
      access of the hip was done by anterior-lateral approach. The investigators used in all cases&#xD;
      hybrid type total arthroplasty (cementation of the femoral component and fixation of the&#xD;
      acetabular component by means of pressure fitting of the implant to the bone and the addition&#xD;
      of screws to the acetabular cup when necessary).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carbohydrate drink Patients belonging to the Acerto group received a drink (200 mL)&#xD;
      containing water plus 12% maltodextrin 2h before the induction of anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immune supplementation therapy. The patients in the ACERTO group received an immune&#xD;
      supplement containing arginine, w-3 fatty acids, nucleotides, and vitamins (Impact; Nestlé;&#xD;
      Sao Paulo, Brazil. Formula: proteins: 23% (77% calcium caseinate, 23% arginine);&#xD;
      carbohydrates: 52% (100% maltodextrin); lipids: 25% (68% fish oil; 20% medium-chain&#xD;
      triglycerides and 12% corn oil), vitamins and electrolytes) for five days prior to surgery,&#xD;
      with a daily dosage of thress units (600ml per day in total).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples. Blood samples were collected preoperatively and at the 2nd PO day and assayed&#xD;
      for CRP assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for hospital discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discharge was signed by an orthopedic surgeon if all of these five parameters were fulfilled:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. patient is confident and willing to go home,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. no pain or pain controlled by oral analgesics,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. walking alone or with minimal help,&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. no fever or signs of postoperative infection, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. accepting normal oral diet&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome variables The main outcome variable was the postoperative length of stay. As&#xD;
      secondary outcome variables it was compared the evolution of serum C-reactive protein (CRP)&#xD;
      overtime.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis. The calculation of the sample was based on the premise that the&#xD;
      intervention with the Acerto Project protocol would reduce the hospital stay length by 50%.&#xD;
      For a β error (type II) of 20% and an α error (type I) of 5%, it was calculated that 15&#xD;
      patients in each group would be sufficient for this study. Investigators used paired and&#xD;
      unpaired t-test when samples were homogeneous or the Mann-Whitney test or the Wilcoxon test&#xD;
      if samples were heterogeneous. Categorical variables were compared by the chi square test or&#xD;
      Fisher exact test. Statistical analyses were made using the Minitab 14 and the null&#xD;
      hypothesis rejection was fixed at 0.05 (α=5%).&#xD;
