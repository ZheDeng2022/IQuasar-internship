  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the pharmacokinetics (relative bioavailability) and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics, after single subcutaneous application, in healthy volunteers of both sexes,&#xD;
      between pegfilgrastim formulation, produced by Eurofarma Laboratorios S/A and Neulastim®&#xD;
      (reference formulation), marketed by Produtos Roche Químicos e Farmacêuticos S/A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to that, a pharmacodynamics comparison will be performed, through change in&#xD;
      absolute neutrophil count in leukogram performed in the same time of pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      analysis collection and through CD34+ cell count in peripheral blood at timepoints 0:00,&#xD;
      96:00 and 384:00 hours.&#xD;
