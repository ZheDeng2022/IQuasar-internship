  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of the study are to assess the safety, tolerability, preliminary efficacy and&#xD;
      PK of multiple subcutaneous (SC) doses of pegcetacoplan in subjects with paroxysmal nocturnal&#xD;
      hemoglobinuria (PNH) who have not received treatment with eculizumab in the past.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An exploratory objective of the study is to assess the pharmacodynamics (PD) of multiple SC&#xD;
      doses of pegcetacoplan when administered to PNH patients.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase Ib, open-label, multiple ascending dose, pilot study in patients with PNH who&#xD;
      have not received eculizumab (Soliris)® in the past. Two cohorts of 3 subjects are planned&#xD;
      for evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be assessed throughout the study; serial blood and urine samples will be&#xD;
      collected for these assessments. Blood samples will be collected for the assessment of&#xD;
      pegcetacoplan PK. Additional samples for assessment of PD will also be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of four parts;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part 1: subjects will receive pegcetacoplan for 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part 2A: subjects may continue to receive pegcetacoplan for a further 56 days if there&#xD;
           is evidence of perceived clinical benefit following review of available safety, PK and&#xD;
           PD data by the investigator and sponsor&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part 2B/Part 2C: subjects may continue to receive daily pegcetacoplan treatment for up&#xD;
           to 364 days if there is ongoing evidence of clinical benefit following review of the&#xD;
           available safety, PK and PD data. After completion of Part 2B, subjects could continue&#xD;
           treatment with pegcetacoplan by transitioning to an open-label extension study or Part&#xD;
           2C, if enrollment into the extension study was not yet available. Subjects entering Part&#xD;
           2C continued their pegcetacoplan dose and regimen until enrollment in the open-label&#xD;
           extension study was available.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part 3: Safety follow up Screening will take place within 30 days prior to the start of&#xD;
           dosing on Day 1. If needed (see inclusion criteria), Neisseria menigitides types A, C,&#xD;
           W, Y and B (administered as two separate vaccinations), Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine&#xD;
           or Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine 23 (PCV13 or PPSV23, respectively), and&#xD;
           Haemophilus influenzae Type B (Hib) vaccinations will be administered at least 14 days&#xD;
           prior to dosing on Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be entered into Part 1 of the study on Day 1 at a time designated by the PI.&#xD;
      During Part 1, the first 3 daily SC doses of pegcetacoplan (Day 1 to 3) as well as doses on&#xD;
      Day 8, 15 and 22 will be administered at the clinical site. From Day 4 to Day 28 daily doses&#xD;
      of pegcetacoplan will be administered off-site by a trained study nurse at the subject's&#xD;
      home, workplace, or other location convenient to the subject with the exception of those days&#xD;
      where dosing is at the clinical site. Following ongoing review of available safety, PK and PD&#xD;
      data by the investigator and sponsor, subjects showing evidence of perceived clinical benefit&#xD;
      may progress to Part 2A and then to Part 2B of the study and continue to receive daily doses&#xD;
      of pegcetacoplan until Day 84 and then until Day 364.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 2 will not be initiated until all subjects in Cohort 1 have reached the Day 29 visit&#xD;
      and the SMC has reviewed emerging safety and efficacy data and determined that, at the&#xD;
      initial dose, pegcetacoplan has an acceptable safety and tolerability profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The planned length of participation in the study for each subject in Cohort 2 is&#xD;
      approximately 444 days (14.5 months) from Day 30 through completion of the Day 414 Exit visit&#xD;
      procedures).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is planned to take place over approximately 24 months (from screening of Cohort 1&#xD;
      through completion of Cohort 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This time period may change in the event that the study is terminated early, additional&#xD;
      cohorts are enrolled, additional time is required to review safety between cohorts, or&#xD;
      extended safety and PK sampling is added for a cohort.&#xD;

    <description>TEAEs were defined as adverse events (AEs) that occurred after dosing on Day 1 and up to 30 days after the last dose of study drug. A treatment-related TEAE is defined as a TEAE with a relationship to study drug of probably, possibly, unlikely, or unrelated. A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any AE that resulted in death; was life-threatening; required hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; resulted in persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of ability to conduct normal life functions; was a congenital anomaly or birth defect. TEAEs were graded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.03 based on: Grade 1: Mild; Grade 2: Moderate; Grade 3: Severe; Grade 4: Life-threatening; Grade 5: Death related to AE.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>This Phase 1b, pilot study was conducted at 9 sites in 5 countries (Hong Kong, Malaysia, New Zealand, Thailand and United States) in subjects with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) who had not received treatment with eculizumab (Soliris®) in the past, between 01 December 2015 and 26 August 2019. A total of 22 subjects were enrolled.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Subjects could participate in more than 1 cohort. The study consisted of 3 parts: Part 1 for Cohorts 1 and 2, Part 2 (Part 2A, Part 2B and Part 2C) for Cohort 2 only and Part 3 (safety follow-up). Cohort 2 dosing was not initiated until all subjects in Cohort 1 had completed Part 1 and review of emerging safety and efficacy data. Overall, 2 cohorts of 22 unique subjects were evaluated.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Number of Subjects With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) Including by Severity</title>
        <description>TEAEs were defined as adverse events (AEs) that occurred after dosing on Day 1 and up to 30 days after the last dose of study drug. A treatment-related TEAE is defined as a TEAE with a relationship to study drug of probably, possibly, unlikely, or unrelated. A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any AE that resulted in death; was life-threatening; required hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; resulted in persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of ability to conduct normal life functions; was a congenital anomaly or birth defect. TEAEs were graded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.03 based on: Grade 1: Mild; Grade 2: Moderate; Grade 3: Severe; Grade 4: Life-threatening; Grade 5: Death related to AE.</description>
