      This study is part of a project intended to develop guidelines to optimise the dosing of&#xD;
      fentanyl in intensive care patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will focus on determining:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Whether the pharmacokinetics of fentanyl change during the ICU stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To what extent / the degree of change in fentanyl pharmacokinetics in ICU patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Which factors (e.g. physiological variables) that cause such a change.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Based on simulations, determine context-sensitive half-times of fentanyl in ICU&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for treatment involving mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation will be in need of sedation and analgesia in order to relieve pain and discomfort&#xD;
      from necessary therapeutic procedures (1-7). The opioid fentanyl is frequently used as part&#xD;
      of these sedation regimens(1-7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of fentanyl after long-term&#xD;
      administration in ICU patients has not been studied extensively. In a study in children&#xD;
      (fentanyl infusion time 7-144 hrs.), increased volume of distribution was found when compared&#xD;
      to data obtained after short-term use (9). The volume of distribution of alfentanil was&#xD;
      increased when compared with data obtained after short-term use in a study of adult ICU&#xD;
      patients sedated with propofol and alfentanil (a rapid-onset opioid) for 24 hrs.&#xD;
      post-operatively (10). A similar increase in distribution volume of another opioid,&#xD;
      sufentanil, was found in adult ICU patients (average sufentanil infusion time 12 days)(11).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experience obtained during clinical anaesthesia suggests that the duration of action in&#xD;
      fentanyl is significantly prolonged after long-term intravenous infusions (12-13). This&#xD;
      property of fentanyl seems to be caused by a combination of factors. Since fentanyl has a&#xD;
      large volume of distribution there will be a continuous return of the drug from peripheral&#xD;
      tissues, and the concentration of fentanyl in plasma will be maintained in a clinically&#xD;
      active range for some time after a fentanyl infusion has been terminated (9). Fentanyl also&#xD;
      potentiates the sedative effects of e.g. propofol and midazolam which contributes to a&#xD;
      further protraction of the wake-up time (14-15).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In ICU patients these undesirable effects of fentanyl will probably be amplified as a result&#xD;
      of major changes in volume of distribution and administration of fentanyl infusions for&#xD;
      extensive periods of time (weeks). The investigators believe that knowledge of the PK of&#xD;
      fentanyl in this population will be valuable to help designing optimised infusion regimens of&#xD;
      fentanyl in the clinical setting of the ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main study objective is to determine wether the pharmacokinetics of fentanyl change&#xD;
      during the ICU stay, and the extent of this change. The investigators will try to unveil&#xD;
      which factors (e.g physiological variables) that cause such change, and based on simulations,&#xD;
      determine context-sensitive half-times of fentanyl in ICU patients. As a result of this study&#xD;
      the investigators aim to develop an infusion pump program to predict fentanyl plasma&#xD;
      concentrations, and the recovery time of fentanyl effect (time to plasma concentration 1&#xD;
      ng/ml). Furthermore the investigators intend to test if the fentanyl infusion pump program&#xD;
      predicts fentanyl plasma concentrations in a separate group of ICU patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study there will not be administration of an investigational product per study&#xD;
      protocol. The dosage and administration of fentanyl will be according to the ICUs established&#xD;
      procedures and the treating physician's judgment of what is appropriate for the patient. In&#xD;
      the ICUs of Oslo University Hospital fentanyl is administered intravenously as a continuous&#xD;
      infusion on an infusion pump System or if needed as single bolus doses given by a handheld&#xD;
      syringe. By routine ICUs in Oslo University Hospital usually dose the fentanyl infusion as&#xD;
      0,5 - 6 μg/kg/hrs, where kg is a calculation of the patients Ideal Body Weight. The fentanyl&#xD;
      used is from marketed stock in the ICUs and is delivered by the hospital pharmacy. All&#xD;
      medication is labelled with information and stored according to local regulations.&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited from surgical, neurosurgical and medical ICUs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On study days the investigator will screen the patients admitted to the ICU during the last&#xD;
      24 hrs. If patients are eligible for the study due to the selection criteria, they will be&#xD;
      included in a chronological order.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject must give his/hers informed consent. The gravity of the clinical situation for&#xD;
      ICU patients may preclude informed consent before inclusion in the study. In that case, the&#xD;
      patient's relatives (or legal representative) will receive information about the study, and&#xD;
      will be provided the opportunity to express their opinion. If the patient´s relatives (or&#xD;
      legal representative) are against participation, the patient will not be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Daily sedation cessation and spontaneous awakening trials are implemented as standard&#xD;
      treatment regimens in the ICU's of Oslo University Hospital. In this study the investigators&#xD;
      intend to collect blood samples over a sedation cessation period, when no fentanyl is to be&#xD;
      administered to the patient. If the participants needs opioid analgesia during this period,&#xD;
      alternative opioid painkillers will be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first blood sample will be collected right before administration of fentanyl is to be&#xD;
      temporarily stopped. During the following hours repeated samples will be collected. The&#xD;
      samples will be collected randomly within a time block containing consecutive time points.&#xD;
      Each participant will accordingly contribute samples from the entire collection time period.&#xD;
      Fentanyl will again be given as prescribed by the treating physician when the sedation&#xD;
      cessation period has ended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples will be spinned and stored on ice in a biobank for later analysis at The Dept. of&#xD;
      Clinical Pharmacology, St.Olavs Hospital, Trondheim, Norway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participants in the study undergo treatment with continuous veno venous haemodialysis&#xD;
      (CVVHD), investigators want to assess whether haemodialysis influences the degree of change&#xD;
      in fentanyl PK. Haemodialysis is thought to have minimal effect upon the clearance of&#xD;
      fentanyl, since fentanyl is mostly cleared by non-renal mechanisms. In addition fentanyl has&#xD;
      high molecular weight, high protein binding capacity, low water solubility and an abundant&#xD;
      volume of distribution that make it less likely dialyzable (16-17). There will be collected&#xD;
      blood samples from the prefilter and postfilter line of the hemodialysis machine to asses if&#xD;
      the dialysis filter might absorb fentanyl and remove drug from the circulation. The sampling&#xD;
      times will follow the predefined block-sampling regimen of the arterial blood tests.&#xD;
      Investigators also plan to calculate dialysis clearance of fentanyl in a subset of 10&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fentanyl is primarily metabolized in the liver by the Cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) enzymatic&#xD;
      route (18-19). A study of genetic markers and polymorphism in the genes coding for these&#xD;
      enzymes could possibly explain some of the variation in fentanyl PK in the ICU population&#xD;
      (20-21). There will be collected a blood sample for later DNA processing to search for&#xD;
      relevant genetic markers and polymorphisms in Cytochrome P450 enzymes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main metabolite of fentanyl is norfentanyl (18-19). Concentration of norfentanyl in the&#xD;
      daily arterial blood samples will be quantified to make it possible to calculate the&#xD;
      metabolic ratio of fentanyl/norfentanyl. The metabolic ratio will indicate to which extent&#xD;
      each participant metabolizes fentanyl without having to take the plasma concentrations into&#xD;
      account.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Norfentanyl is eliminated by the kidneys(18-19). There will be taken daily samples of urine&#xD;
      to determine the urine concentrations of this metabolite.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To further asses possible covariates of fentanyl PK, patient demographics, medical history,&#xD;
      co-morbidity, data descriptive of the population, concomitant medication and daily&#xD;
      registrations of organ function parameters will be recorded for each patient during the study&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments and blood sampling will continue as long as the patient needs artificial&#xD;
      ventilation and are treated with significant amounts of fentanyl.&#xD;
