  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The SABR-ATAC trial (Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy and anti-TGFB Antibody Combination)&#xD;
      is a phase I/II trial that studies the side effects and efficacy of fresolimumab, an&#xD;
      anti-transforming growth factor beta (TGFB) antibody, when given with stereotactic ablative&#xD;
      radiotherapy in patients with stage IA-IB non-small cell lung cancer. Fresolimumab may&#xD;
      inhibit radiation side effects and block tumor growth through multiple mechanisms.&#xD;
      Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR), also known as stereotactic body radiotherapy&#xD;
      (SBRT), is a specialized form of radiation therapy that precisely delivers high dose&#xD;
      radiation directly to tumors, thus killing tumor cells and minimizing damage to normal&#xD;
      tissue. Giving fresolimumab with SABR may work better in treating patients with early stage&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer than treating with SABR alone.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1: Evaluate the safe dose of fresolimumab in combination with stereotactic ablative&#xD;
      radiotherapy (SABR) in patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2. Evaluate the rate of radiation induced pulmonary fibrosis after SABR plus&#xD;
      fresolimumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate potential adverse events in patients receiving fresolimumab plus SABR. (Phase I)&#xD;
      II. Evaluate post treatment changes in pulmonary function. (Phase I) III. Evaluate recurrence&#xD;
      rates and progression free survival. (Phase I) IV. Assess pharmacokinetics (PK) of&#xD;
      fresolimumab in combination with SABR (optional for patient). (Phase I) V. Evaluate the rate&#xD;
      and severity of radiation induced pulmonary fibrosis after SABR plus fresolimumab. (Phase I)&#xD;
      VI. Evaluate the severity of radiation induced pulmonary fibrosis after SABR plus&#xD;
      fresolimumab. (Phase II) VII. Evaluate potential adverse events in patients receiving&#xD;
      fresolimumab plus SABR. (Phase II) VIII. Evaluate post treatment changes in pulmonary&#xD;
      function. (Phase II) IX. Evaluate recurrence rates and progression free survival. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose escalation study of fresolimumab followed by a phase II&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive fresolimumab intravenously (IV) on days 1, 15, and 36 and undergo SABR in 4&#xD;
      fractions between days 8 and 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3, 6, and 12 months.&#xD;
