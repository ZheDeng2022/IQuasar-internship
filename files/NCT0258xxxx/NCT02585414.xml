  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dry eye syndrome (DES) is a highly prevalent ocular condition with potential severe&#xD;
      consequences for affected patients. DES can be either caused by decreased tear production or&#xD;
      increased tear evaporation, both leading to an instable tear film. Despite many efforts,&#xD;
      generally accepted methodologies to diagnose, assess the severity and monitor DES are still&#xD;
      lacking. Moreover, widely used clinical methods such as tear break up time (BUT), fluorescein&#xD;
      staining of the cornea or Schirmer test only poorly reflect patients´ complains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the main problems in the diagnosis and treatment of DES is that the most critical&#xD;
      component - the tear film itself - is difficult to characterize. The development of new&#xD;
      ultra-high resolution optical coherence tomography systems allows now for the direct&#xD;
      visualization of the human tear film and for the non-invasive in-vivo measurement of tear&#xD;
      film thickness (TFT). The investigators could recently show that this system provides&#xD;
      excellent reproducibility and is able to assess even subtle changes in TFT induced by&#xD;
      therapeutic interventions. However, to which extent tear film thickness is associated with&#xD;
      other standard clinical measures of DES is currently unknown. In the present study, the&#xD;
      investigators set out to test the hypothesis that ocular TFT is a new and good surrogate&#xD;
      parameter for the assessment of the severity of DES.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consequently, the aim of the study presented in this protocol is to investigate whether and&#xD;
      if so, to what extent clinical signs of DES and reported symptoms are reflected in ocular&#xD;
      TFT. For this purpose, a cross sectional study in healthy subjects and patients with DES will&#xD;
      be performed. This should allow the investigators to more specifically characterize the role&#xD;
      of the tear film in DES and to assess whether measurement of TFT with OCT can be a promising&#xD;
      surrogate parameter for the diagnosis and the follow up of DES.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Men and women aged over 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Normal findings in the medical history unless the investigator considers an&#xD;
             abnormality to be clinically irrelevant&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Normal ophthalmic findings, ametropia &lt; 6 Dpt.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion criteria for patients with DES:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men and women aged over 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  DES patients will be included based on three questions:&#xD;

               -  (1) &quot;Have you ever been diagnosed (by a clinician) as having dry eye syndrome?&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  (2) &quot;Do you currently use artificial tear eyedrops or gel?&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  (3) &quot;For the past three months or longer, have you had dry eyes? (This is&#xD;
