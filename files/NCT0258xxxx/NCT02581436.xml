      This study evaluates the addition of &quot;Kidney Solid Organ Rejection Test&quot; (kSORT), in the&#xD;
      clinical follow-up of renal transplant recipients, compared to clinical standard surveillance&#xD;
      in the first two years after kidney transplantation. The design of the study is a partially&#xD;
      blinded, randomized control trial of patients with living and deceased donor. The recruitment&#xD;
      will be in a third level attention hospital in Mexico city (Instituto Nacional de Ciencias&#xD;
      Médicas y Nutrición Salvador Zubirán). The main outcomes are the rate and grade of acute&#xD;
      rejection, histologic chronic index of the one year protocol biopsy and glomerular filtration&#xD;
      rate.&#xD;

      I. Background Kidney transplantation is the treatment of choice in patients with end stage&#xD;
      renal disease in need of function replacement therapy, and in whom there is no absolute&#xD;
      contraindication to the procedure. The current figures reported in the USA on post-transplant&#xD;
      graft survival at one year, are 95% in cases of living donor (LD) recipients and 90% in&#xD;
      deceased donor (DD) recipients3; the mean calculated survival of these grafts has increased&#xD;
      and is currently 14 years in LD and 11 years in DD recipients. The fact that graft survival&#xD;
      hinges on multiple immune and non-immune factors is well recognized; however, the main cause&#xD;
      of graft loss is solidly linked to its rejection, with evidence of involvement of the immune&#xD;
      humoral response in most cases (specific antibodies against HLA antigens).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main cause of acute graft dysfunction is acute rejection (AR). Several studies have&#xD;
      associated episodes of this entity with chronic structural injury and subsequent functional&#xD;
      impairment. Thus, timely diagnostic certainty is pivotal so as to optimize immunosuppressive&#xD;
      therapy and preserve graft function. To date, the only tool available to confirm AR is graft&#xD;
      biopsy and its established histological diagnostic criteria8. However, this diagnostic tool&#xD;
      has limitations resulting mainly from sampling errors and costs. Furthermore, about 10% of&#xD;
      patients with normal graft function have evidence of AR in protocol biopsies, so centers that&#xD;
      do not use this follow-up modality in kidney transplant recipients (KTR) are unable to&#xD;
      document this immune phenomenon. Ideally, an AR non-invasive, diagnostic tool would be of&#xD;
      utmost use in KTR follow-up since it would preclude the need for graft biopsies and&#xD;
      efficiently support the management of immune suppressors. Therefore, the systematic&#xD;
      performance of a highly specific and sensitive assay reflecting AR, would allow for the&#xD;
      timely detection of this immune phenomenon compared to the current standard (biopsy).&#xD;
      Moreover, the systematic use of a tool with these characteristics would allow stratification&#xD;
      of the immunological risk as well as proactive adjustment of immunosuppressor drug dosages,&#xD;
      potentially limiting chronic injury and improving the graft's survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The background to the proposed study is based on the extensive line of research conducted by&#xD;
      Dr. Sarwal et al. They have recently published results10 on monitored pediatric kidney&#xD;
      transplant recipients. Biomarkers of gene panels in peripheral blood detected by microarray&#xD;
      were discovered in a single institution and subsequently validated by quantitative-PCR in 12&#xD;
      pediatric kidney transplant programs. A total of 367 individual blood samples, each paired to&#xD;
      a graft biopsy for blinded centralized classification, were analyzed (115 with acute&#xD;
      rejection, 180 with stable kidney graft function, and 72 with other causes of graft injury).&#xD;
      Among the genes differentially expressed in microarrays, quantitative-PCR analysis of a set&#xD;
      of 5 genes (DUSP1, PBEF1, PSEN1, MAPK9 and NLTR) classified acute rejection with great&#xD;
      precision. The 5 gene model has a sensitivity of 91%, specificity of 94%, positive predictive&#xD;
      value of 83%, negative predictive value of 97% and a 92% precision when differentiating acute&#xD;
      rejection samples from other phenotypes (stable and no acute rejection, no acute rejection/&#xD;
      non-stable). Interestingly, 8/12 samples from patients with borderline rejection on biopsy,&#xD;
      were classified as acute rejection with the 5 gene model. The frequent prediction of the&#xD;
      phenotype in borderline rejection biopsies suggests that pre-clinical injury in acute&#xD;
      rejection could also be identified by quantitative-PCR in peripheral blood samples, thus&#xD;
      allowing earlier treatment of these patients.10 The fact that this model predicts acute&#xD;
      rejection in both cellular and humoral immune injury modalities, is of utmost relevance.&#xD;
      Moreover, these genes in peripheral blood, strongly linked to graft rejection, do not&#xD;
      correlate (are independent) with many demographic, clinical, treatment modalities and&#xD;
      bacterial/viral infection parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 5 genes are centered on leukocyte trafficking and T/B cell activation and are mostly&#xD;
      expressed in monocytes, activated in the peripheral circulation; they reflect injury response&#xD;
      mechanisms to cellular oxidative stress (DUSP1), apoptosis (MAPK9), IL2-dependent cytolytic&#xD;
      gene activation (NKTR), increased cell adhesion via the e-cadherin/catenin complex (PSEN1)&#xD;
      and smooth muscle vascular cell injury (PBEF1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The authors pointed out that the study was conducted in a pediatric and young adult&#xD;
      population, in whom rejection may be more aggressive due to the disparity between the adult&#xD;
      transplanted organ and the pediatric recipient, or as a result of poor treatment adherence in&#xD;
      adolescent recipients, leading to a stronger immune response. Thus, the 5-gene model would&#xD;
      require further evaluation in order to determine its diagnostic potential of acute rejection&#xD;
      in patients of all ages, in larger patient cohorts and in association with different&#xD;
      immunosuppressant regimes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For these reasons, the same group of investigators undertook a large study to identify a&#xD;
      transcription profile that would unify the kidney transplant recipient population&#xD;
      independently of age, the cause of terminal renal disease, comorbidities, and the type of&#xD;
      immune suppression used in different centers in the USA, Mexico and Europe. The final&#xD;
      selection of 17 genes included 10 genes in the pediatric population and 7 newly identified&#xD;
      genes and allowed the molecular classification of acute rejection in adult and pediatric&#xD;
      patients. They correctly predicted the presence of acute rejection and non-acute rejection in&#xD;
      the different samples collected from patients in various participating study sites, and in&#xD;
      recipients of different ages with no previous data normalization. On the basis of these&#xD;
      observations, a score was generated using 14 of the 17 genes, and with Pearson's correlation&#xD;
      test, a score was attributed to each detected gene and compared with the genetic profile&#xD;
      found in patients with and without rejection, assigning the number +1 or -1. The score ranges&#xD;
      between -13 and +13. Among the patients in whom the score predicted a &quot;high risk of&#xD;
      rejection&quot; (Acute Rejection Risk-Score ≥ 7), 90.24% were correctly classified as acute&#xD;
      rejection, while if the test predicted &quot;a very low risk of acute rejection&quot; (Acute Rejection&#xD;
      Risk-Score ≤ -7), 97.7% were correctly classified as non-acute rejection on the basis of the&#xD;
      biopsy findings. Furthermore, the average predictive probability of acute rejection was&#xD;
      highly significant when comparing acute rejection vs. non-acute rejection in 4 centers&#xD;
      (p&lt;0.0001; p=0.002; p&lt;0.0001; p&lt;00001), respectively. This model equally detected acute&#xD;
      rejections mediated by antibodies as well as those that were cell-mediated, with a high&#xD;
      predictive probability. The prediction of acute rejection was independent of the&#xD;
      post-transplant period duration. These 17 genes are included in the KSORT assay (Kidney Solid&#xD;
      Organ Rejection Test) and the algorithm generating the risk score is known as the kSORT&#xD;
      analysis suit (kSAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a recently published study with data from our Institute, in which the results of biopsies&#xD;
      obtained because of post-transplant dysfunction were reviewed between January 2007 and&#xD;
      December 2011 (n=223), we observed an AR incidence during the first year post-transplant of&#xD;
      11.8% in live donor KTR and of 17.4% in deceased donor graft recipients. Throughout 2013, the&#xD;
      number of kidney transplants performed at the Institute increased to 63 (53% from living&#xD;
      donors, 46% from deceased donors). In accordance with our institutional protocol for the&#xD;
      follow-up of kidney transplant recipients, we currently obtain protocol graft biopsies on the&#xD;
      3rd and 12th month post-transplant. The protocol biopsies are obtained at established&#xD;
      timepoints with the purpose of documenting whether there is any evidence of immunological&#xD;
      activity (sub-clinical) or signs of other pathologies that would require modification of the&#xD;
      immunosuppressive therapeutic regime. We also obtain a graft biopsy at any point in the&#xD;
      post-transplant period if abnormalities in renal function develop, defined as a verified&#xD;
      increase in serum creatinine ≥ 25% over previous baseline values, and in the absence of other&#xD;
      evident pathologies such as obstructive processes of the urinary tract, urinary tract&#xD;
      infections, dehydration, supra-therapeutic blood levels of the used calcineurin inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As of May 2013, the date in which the 3rd month protocol biopsy was established, we have&#xD;
      documented an incidence of sub-clinical acute rejections, including borderline and major&#xD;
      rejections according to the Banff classification, of 52% (10/40 biopsies revealed acute&#xD;
      cellular or humoral rejection and 11/40 had borderline injury). This number is unprecedented&#xD;
      at the Institute because protocol biopsies were not previously obtained on the 3rd month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, all KTR at the Institute receive an induction therapy modality (Thymoglobulin or&#xD;
      Basiliximab), depending on their individual immunological risk and the origin of the graft.&#xD;
      Hence, all live donor KT recipients with a PRA &lt;30% and no HLA donor specific antibodies&#xD;
      (DSA) are treated with Basiliximab (anti-IL2R monoclonal antibody; 2 doses of 20mg each); the&#xD;
      exceptions are KTR sharing 2 haplotypes with their donor and that receive no induction&#xD;
      therapy. All deceased donor graft recipients (independently of the PRA %), live donor KTR&#xD;
      with positive donor-specific HLA antibodies (independently of the PRA %) or with a PRA ≥30%,&#xD;
      are induced with Thymoglobulin (rabbit polyclonal antibody preparation, at a total dose of&#xD;
      4.5mg/Kg). All patients must have a lymphocyte crossmatch test (T/B), a negative CDC-AHG and&#xD;
      those with DSA (Single antigen, Luminex) also require a negative crossmatch by flow&#xD;
      cytometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biopsy-proven acute rejection events are treated with pulses of methylprednisolone for 3&#xD;
      consecutive days. Patients with steroid-resistant acute cellular rejection (biopsy-proven),&#xD;
      are administered Thymoglobulin (1.5 mg/Kg/body weight, for 7 days). Patients with&#xD;
      antibody-mediated acute rejection (humoral rejection) are treated with 3-5 plasmapheresis&#xD;
      (PP) sessions, 100 mg IV Ig per Kg body weight after each PP session and rituximab (anti-CD20&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody) at the end of all PP sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard initial and maintenance immunosuppressive regime is Tacrolimus, Mofetil&#xD;
      Mycophenolate and prednisone. The initial Tacrolimus doses are aimed to obtain blood trough&#xD;
      levels of 10 to 15 ng/mL, until the 3rd month post-transplant; subsequently and in the&#xD;
      absence of AR during the first trimester (clinical or by protocol biopsy), the trough levels&#xD;
      are maintained between 8 and 10 ng/mL throughout the first year post-transplant. The&#xD;
      maintenance dose of prednisone is 5 mg daily and that of Mofetil Mycophenolate is 1-1.5 g&#xD;
      daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Justification In previous paragraphs, we described the KSORT test's high sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity in the detection of acute rejection. It is now necessary to attempt its transfer&#xD;
      into the clinical setting and to help support treatment decisions, such as increasing immune&#xD;
      suppression based on a positive test result. The impact of this maneuver on efficacy and&#xD;
      safety outcomes will be pivotal in order to incorporate this scrutinizing method into daily&#xD;
      clinical practice. Our Institute has transplanted over 60 patients in the last few years, so&#xD;
      conducting this study in our center is feasible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Hypothesis and aims Hypothesis Adding the kSORT genetic panel to the post-transplant&#xD;
      follow-up will decrease the incidence and severity of acute rejection as well as the&#xD;
      chronicity indices in the yearly protocol biopsy, and will improve the calculated glomerular&#xD;
      filtration rate after a follow-up of two years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the safety and efficacy of adding the kSORT test to the surveillance of patients&#xD;
      after kidney transplantation.&#xD;
