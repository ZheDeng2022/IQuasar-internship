      Our aim is to develop a new diagnostic approach to improve the diagnosis of men suspicious of&#xD;
      having significant prostate cancer (sPCa). The current diagnostic technique (standard&#xD;
      transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsies [TRUS-bx]) rely on multiple prostate biopsy cores&#xD;
      (10-12 samples) and if negative repeated biopsy sessions. This increases both patient&#xD;
      complications (severe infections, bleeding and anxiety) and the diagnosis of insignificant&#xD;
      cancer causing overtreatment. Still, significant cancers are missed. In addition, worldwide&#xD;
      antibiotic-resistant bacteria increase, while effective antibiotics are declining. Thus, a&#xD;
      noninvasive diagnostic tool to improve selection of men with clinically suspicion of PCa who&#xD;
      need a biopsy from those who can avoid one is strongly needed. Previous studies in our&#xD;
      department show that MRI in a selected patient cohort with prior negative TRUS-bx can improve&#xD;
      the detection rate of clinically significant PCa and allows for a more accurate assessment of&#xD;
      cancer stage and aggressiveness. However, the value of an MRI used as a first-line tool in&#xD;
      the diagnostic examination of men in suspicion of PCa is uncertain. Furthermore, a full scale&#xD;
      MRI prostate examination recommended by the European Society of Urogenital Radiology includes&#xD;
      intravenous contrast-media and multiple sequences. This is both time-consuming and cost full,&#xD;
      which reduces its feasibility for more widespread clinical implementation. We believe that a&#xD;
      simpler, faster biparametric MRI (bpMRI) using less scan sequences and circumvents&#xD;
      intravenous contrast-media and anti-peristaltic drugs would decrease image acquisition time,&#xD;
      reduce costs and is sufficient to preserve diagnostic accuracy for sPCa detection in&#xD;
      biopsy-naive men. Consequently, we will include biopsy-naive men in a protocol-based research&#xD;
      project. The objective is to assess the diagnostic accuracy of bpMRI to rule out sPCa and&#xD;
      whether a bpMRI can be used as a diagnostic non-invasive screening tool to 1) improve the&#xD;
      diagnosis of sPCa 2) assess cancer aggressiveness 3) increase precision of biopsies and 4)&#xD;
      reduce the number of biopsy sessions and cores. We evaluate the clinical significance of the&#xD;
      detected cancers and whether bpMRI could be used as a triage test to improve the diagnosis of&#xD;
      sPCa and aid in the determination of which men could safely avoid unnecessary biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This new diagnostic approach has the potential to significantly reduce patient hazards and&#xD;
      complications. We aim to reach 1000 included men. We believe that bpMRI used in the clinical&#xD;
      decision-making has the potential to change the future management of PCa. However, we still&#xD;
      miss the scientific evidence to substantiate its preliminary promising results before this&#xD;
      technique can be widely used to benefit all men. This large research project is to the best&#xD;
      of our knowledge powered to include the largest patient sample size published within this&#xD;
      field.&#xD;

      Purpose Our aim is to assess whether a screening bpMRI can be used as a diagnostic&#xD;
      non-invasive screening tool to 1) improve the diagnosis of sPCa 2) predict cancer&#xD;
      aggressiveness 3) increase precision of biopsies and 4) reduce the number of biopsy sessions&#xD;
      and cores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial subjects Subjects are recruited at the Department of Urology, Herlev Gentofte&#xD;
      University Hospital. Annually, approx. 1.600 men are referred to the department due to&#xD;
      clinical suspicion of PCa. Roughly 1.100 men further proceeds to standard TRUS-bx prostate&#xD;
      biopsies. These men are invited to participate as subjects in this study and undergo a bpMRI&#xD;
      before biopsies, if they fulfil the inclusion criteria. All subjects provide written informed&#xD;
      consent and can withdraw their consent at any time with no consequence in relation to their&#xD;
      standard treatment. Intended sample size calculations (power 0•9 and 2-sided significance&#xD;
      0•05) were based on estimates of diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) and&#xD;
      detection rates by biopsy techniques (SBx and TBx) from prior mpMRI studies assuming&#xD;
      prevalence of sPCa of 30%. Target sample size was minimum 600 patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design This study is designed as a prospective interventional study. All enrolled&#xD;
      patients undergo a screening bpMRI of the prostate within 1-2 weeks after inclusion and prior&#xD;
      to biopsies. All MRI data undergo blinded evaluation according to a modified PIRADS version 2&#xD;
      classification from the European Society of Urogenital Radiology (ESUR) 18 by an experienced&#xD;
      physician who register and score all suspicious lesions on a five-point scale (1- very low, 2&#xD;
      - low, 3 - intermediate, 4- high and 5 - very high) according to the overall probability of&#xD;
      having significant PCa. As the bpMRI protocol does not include dynamic contrast-enhanced&#xD;
      (DCE) imaging, scoring of lesions in the peripheral zone relied solely on DWI findings. The&#xD;
      bpMRI is within 4-weeks followed by standard 10-core TRUS-bx performed according to current&#xD;
      standard practice and blinded to any MRI findings. The TRUS-operator then subsequently&#xD;
      reviews the MRI data and rapport on a dedicated workstation in the biopsy room to identify&#xD;
      suspicious lesions presented and outlined by the radiologist. Any suspicious lesions are then&#xD;
      targeted by additional bpMRI-guided biopsies using bpMRI-TRUS image fusion based software.&#xD;
      BpMRI suspicion scores and biopsy results from TRUS-bx and bpMRI-bx are compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, all enrolled patients are clinically followed for 5 years after the initial&#xD;
      biopsies to detect any subsequent diagnosis of PCa, treatment recurrence or metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI image acquisition:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 3T MRI-scanner (Ingenia, Philips Healthcare, the Best, the Netherlands) is used for all&#xD;
      patients with a pelvic-phased-array coil (Philips Healthcare, Best, the Netherlands)&#xD;
      positioned over the pelvis. Anatomical (T2W) and diffusion-weighted images (DWI) including 4&#xD;
      b-values (b0, b100, b800 and b2000) along with reconstruction of the corresponding apparent&#xD;
      diffusion coefficient (ADC) map (b-values 100 and 800) are obtained from below the prostatic&#xD;
      apex to above the seminal vesicles. A sagittal T2W luxury scout supported the axial sequences&#xD;
      for MRI/TRUS image fusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pathological evaluation A genitourinary pathologist with more than 11 yrs of dedicated&#xD;
      experience in prostatic pathology reviews and describes all histological biopsy samples. For&#xD;
      each PCa positive biopsy core, the location and prostatic region, the Gleason score (GS) 19&#xD;
      and the extent of cancer core involvement (%) are determined. Various definitions of sPCa are&#xD;
      assessed including GS and tumor volume.&#xD;
