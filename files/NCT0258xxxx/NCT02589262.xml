  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study medicine is a potential future treatment for schizophrenia, an illness that affects&#xD;
      the way that people think, feel or behave. It is not clear what causes schizophrenia, but&#xD;
      it's been linked to chemical imbalance in the brain. It is hoped that the study medicine will&#xD;
      activate specific sites in the brain to help correct that imbalance. Current treatments for&#xD;
      schizophrenia don't work very well and can cause unpleasant side effects. It is hoped that&#xD;
      the study medicine will work better, and have fewer side effects than existing medicines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this 2 part study (Parts A and B), the primary aim is to assess how safe the study&#xD;
      medicine is in healthy men, aged 18-45 years, and how much of it gets into the blood. Its&#xD;
      effects on the brain will also be tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part A, up to 24 participants will receive up to 5 single doses of the study medicine&#xD;
      (AUT00206 or placebo) by mouth, either after fasting or after a high fat breakfast. The study&#xD;
      medicine has never been given to humans before, so the initial doses will be small and the&#xD;
      dose level will be increased as the study progresses. Participants may take up to 14 weeks to&#xD;
      finish the study. They'll make up to 22 outpatient visits, and stay on the ward up to 5&#xD;
      times, for 3 nights in a row each time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part B, 24 participants will receive daily doses of the study medicine (AUT00206 or&#xD;
      placebo) for up to 28 days. Participants will take up to 10 weeks to finish the study.&#xD;
      They'll make 6 outpatient visits, and stay on the ward for up to 30 nights, depending on how&#xD;
      long we expect it to take until blood levels of the study medicine level off.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pharmaceutical company, Autifony Therapeutics Limited, is funding the study. The study will&#xD;
      take place at 1 centre in London.&#xD;
