  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This specimen collection is designed to obtain whole blood and tumor tissue from subjects&#xD;
      diagnosed with cancer for the purpose of the development of a noninvasive liquid biopsy assay&#xD;
      using next generation sequencing (NGS).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-significant risk multicenter, longitudinal specimen collection study. At the&#xD;
      Baseline Visit, whole blood will be collected to be paired with either a previously collected&#xD;
      tumor biopsy tissue sample or a prospectively collected tumor tissue sample. Whole blood&#xD;
      samples will also be collected longitudinally at Interim visits for up to 5 years. Interim&#xD;
      visits will be on a schedule dictated by their physician's standard-of-care management&#xD;
      protocol. No more than 100mL of blood will be collected per month. Tumor tissue from&#xD;
      recurrences will be collected for the duration of subject participation (after the Baseline&#xD;
      Visit).&#xD;

          -  Subject is 18 years of age or older;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is willing to provide written informed consent;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has a diagnosis of a non-hematologic cancer, has tumor in the body, and has&#xD;
             either;&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. residual tumor tissue available for testing by the Sponsor; or&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. genomic profiling results from an IVD or LDT assay performed on tumor biopsy&#xD;
                  tissue; or&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. an invasive procedure (biopsy, surgery) scheduled following the Baseline Visit&#xD;
                  from which residual tumor tissue can be available for testing by the Sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is able, in the professional opinion of the investigator, to provide whole&#xD;
             blood at the Baseline Visit and at the Interim Visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Underwent curative-intent surgery for management of the presently diagnosed tumor, at&#xD;
             any time prior to the Baseline Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Underwent targeted or non-targeted chemotherapy, hormone receptor blocking therapy, or&#xD;
             radiation therapy prior to the Baseline Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Underwent an invasive procedure (biopsy, surgery, thermal ablation) in the 7 days&#xD;
             prior to any blood collection (baseline or follow-up).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any medical or mental condition that would interfere with the subjects' ability to&#xD;
             willingly give written informed consent.&#xD;
