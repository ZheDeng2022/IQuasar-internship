      This study evaluates two group-based Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) lifestyle&#xD;
      interventions delivered in the workplace to individuals at risk for pre-diabetes: 1) an&#xD;
      in-person group-based lifestyle intervention; and 2) an internet-based intervention delivered&#xD;
      using an online platform with lifestyle coaching support. Eligible participants will be&#xD;
      randomized equally to each intervention program (120 participants in each).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study seeks to compare weight loss, changes in physical activity and dietary fat intake,&#xD;
      and participant engagement in two Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) interventions derived&#xD;
      from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) curriculum: an in-person and an&#xD;
      internet-based intervention program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that the internet-based intervention will be more effective in achieving&#xD;
      weight loss than the in-person intervention, given its convenience for participants to&#xD;
      complete sessions and therefore greater potential engagement in the program.&#xD;
