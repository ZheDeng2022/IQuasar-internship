  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study seeks to elucidate the context of pathological and non-pathological eating&#xD;
      behavior in a heterogeneous sample of overweight and obese children, aged 8-14 years.&#xD;
      Children will undergo a two-week ecological momentary assessment (EMA) protocol in which they&#xD;
      record all eating episodes and their physiological, emotional, interpersonal, and&#xD;
      environmental correlates. Specific aims are to identify proximal antecedents and consequences&#xD;
      of pathological and non-pathological eating in overweight and obese children, and to&#xD;
      determine the prevalence of loss of control eating in the natural environment.&#xD;

      Interested individuals will be screened via phone for initial study eligibility. Potentially&#xD;
      eligible participants and their parents will attend an in-person screening at the University&#xD;
      of Chicago in which they will complete assent and consent procedures. Youth will have their&#xD;
      height and weight measured and complete interviews to assess eating disorder symptoms and&#xD;
      psychiatric comorbidities. Eligible participants and parents will then complete self- and&#xD;
      parent-report assessments of eating behavior, body image concerns, psychiatric symptoms, and&#xD;
      interpersonal functioning. Participants will then be trained on how to complete the EMA&#xD;
      recordings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A one-day practice period during which adherence is ≥70% of ratings will qualify children to&#xD;
      initiate the 14-day EMA study period; these data will not be used in statistical analyses to&#xD;
      reduce concerns about the effect of immediate reactivity to self-monitoring. Youth will&#xD;
      self-monitor on a smartphone or other wireless device through the use of the ReTAINE&#xD;
      (Real-Time Assessment in the Natural Environment) system. ReTAINE™ is a secure, web-based&#xD;
      system that allows for momentary data to be collected through a wide variety of portable&#xD;
      devices. Youth may use their own smartphone/wireless device or one provided by the study&#xD;
      team. Recent survey data suggest that up to 80% of children and adolescents have access to&#xD;
      the Internet through a cellular phone or other wireless device, indicating that this approach&#xD;
      is reasonable in this age group. EMA protocols have been completed with good compliance in&#xD;
      youth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will include three types of EMA signaling methods.63 First, participants&#xD;
      will be signaled at 3-5 semi-random times throughout the day (signal-contingent) to report on&#xD;
      current affect, stressors, interpersonal functioning, and to report any eating episode that&#xD;
      has not been previously recorded. These signals will occur at random times between&#xD;
      7:00-8:00am, 3:00-4:00pm, and 6:00-7:00pm on weekdays, so as not to interfere with the school&#xD;
      day; and between 8:00-9:00am, 11:00am-12:00pm, 2:00-3:00pm, 5:00-6:00pm, and 8:00-9:00pm on&#xD;
      weekend days. In addition, participants will be instructed to complete momentary ratings of&#xD;
      affect, stressors, interpersonal functioning, and a variety of physiological, environmental,&#xD;
      cognitive, and behavioral factors associated with eating as soon after each eating episode as&#xD;
      possible (event-contingent). Event-contingent ratings will allow for the assessment of&#xD;
      immediate consequences of eating that may be missed by the random signals. Finally,&#xD;
      participants will complete ratings of affect, stressors, interpersonal functioning, and&#xD;
      physiological, environmental, cognitive, and behavioral factors at the end of each day&#xD;
      (interval-contingent) to capture any changes since the last random signal. This combination&#xD;
      of signal-, event-, and interval- contingent recordings has been successfully implemented in&#xD;
      previous EMA studies of overweight youth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be contacted by phone after the first day of EMA recording, at which point&#xD;
      they will be given feedback regarding their compliance rates, and any questions or concerns&#xD;
      regarding assessment procedures will be discussed with a research assistant. Throughout the&#xD;
      14-day assessment period, we will also attempt to contact participants via telephone at least&#xD;
      twice per week to check in with them regarding any problems or concerns. This approach has&#xD;
      demonstrated success in participant retention and validated compliance during a previous&#xD;
      research study which required daily collection of saliva samples and interval ratings of mood&#xD;
      and disordered eating behaviors over 35 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complementary to the collection of EMA data, Nutritional Data System for Research (NDS-R)65&#xD;
      will be used to compile nutritional intake data on eating episodes reported by participants&#xD;
      through the ReTAINE system. Two weekdays and one weekend day during the 14-day protocol will&#xD;
      be randomly selected for each participant, during which the participant will be contacted by&#xD;
      phone and asked to recall the details of each of that day's eating episodes. The time points&#xD;
      of each eating episode will be entered into the NDS-R system, and the nutritional data of&#xD;
      interest will be merged with the EMA data in order to assess contextual factors associated&#xD;
      with specific dietary patterns (e.g., consumption of high fat meals). ActiGraph watches&#xD;
      (GT3X) will be worn by participants for the duration of the 14-day protocol to compile data&#xD;
      on sleep patterns in the natural home environment. These computerized wristwatch-like devices&#xD;
      collect data generated by movement and are minimally invasive. Participants' parents will&#xD;
      also complete 14-day sleep diaries in which they will record their children's bedtime and&#xD;
      wake time, which will provide the start and end times for actigraphy analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the completion of the daily assessment phase, participants will return to the University&#xD;
      of Chicago to return the loaner smartphone, if applicable; complete a brief, final&#xD;
      assessment; and receive their final study incentive payments. The final assessment will&#xD;
      include a modified version of the Child Eating Disorder Examination (ChEDE) interview to&#xD;
      cover the previous two weeks during which EMA was conducted. This assessment will be used to&#xD;
      determine changes in symptom frequency (i.e., reactivity to study procedures).&#xD;
