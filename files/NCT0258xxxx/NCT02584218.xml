    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate, through a controlled clinical randomized study, the&#xD;
      effectiveness of sealing carious lesions with composite resin in primary molars. For this,&#xD;
      healthy children (n=100) with caries lesion reaching to the middle third of the dentin of&#xD;
      primary molars, will be submitted to different treatments to remove the lesions. These&#xD;
      patients will be randomly allocated in the following treatment groups: (1) cavity sealing&#xD;
      (Non-invasive resin based dental sealing) without caries removal; and (2) Partial caries&#xD;
      removal and Invasive resin based restoration. The clinical and radiographic success of the&#xD;
      treatment groups will be verified by periodic examination of the restorations by USPHS&#xD;
      criteria and radiographic subtraction, respectively, which will be checked progression or not&#xD;
      of injury. The researcher responsible for these assessments will be blind to the study, whose&#xD;
      evaluations will occur after 6, 12, 24 and 36 months of treatment.&#xD;

      The present study will be carried out as a randomized clinical study. Primary, occlusal&#xD;
      caries lesions in children, aged 3-8 years old will be treated by non-invasive resin based&#xD;
      sealing (n= 50) or resin based restoration (n=50). Randomization between sealing and&#xD;
      restoration (1:1) was made by for a resercher at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro and&#xD;
      kept at the clinics in sealed envelopes. The treatments will be examined clinically and&#xD;
      radiographically after 6, 12, 24 and 36 years. The treatments are performed and controlled by&#xD;
      only one practitioner (the main reseacher of this study) from the Federal University of Rio&#xD;
      de Janeiro, Brazil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sealing: The dentist will use a resin based sealing, and follow their usual clinical&#xD;
      procedures based on the instructions from the manufacturer and the guidelines from the&#xD;
      Department of Pediatric Dentistry and Orthodontics of Federal University of Rio de Janeiro,&#xD;
      Brazil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Restoration: The dentist will use preparation design and a resin based resin restoration, and&#xD;
      follow their usual clinical procedures (partial caries removal) based on the instructions&#xD;
      from the manufacturer and the guidelines from Department of Pediatric Dentistry and&#xD;
      Orthodontics of Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalence of regression, arrest and progression of sealed and restored caries lesions,&#xD;
      are computed and related to the clinical and radiological registrations of children, or&#xD;
      treatment related factors for assessing of statistically significant correlations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The influence of each factor on the longevity and need for retreatment of occlusal sealants&#xD;
      and restorations, will be assessed using apropriate analyses for statistical treatment of&#xD;
      data.&#xD;

    <description>Digital bitewing radiographs were taken at baseline and repeated after 6, 12, 24 and 36-months.

    <description>Clinical evaluation will be performed through clinical examination after 6, 12, 24 and 36-months. The USPHS criteria for evaluating the marginal integrity of the restoration will be used. Clinical scores: Alfa - Restoration showing continuity with the anatomical shape ; Bravo - Restoration discontinuous with the anatomical shape , but the loss of material is not enough to expose the floor of the cavity; Charlie - Restoration discontinuous with the anatomical shape and the loss of material is sufficient to expose the floor of the cavity; and Delta - mobile Restoration fractured or lost.</description>
