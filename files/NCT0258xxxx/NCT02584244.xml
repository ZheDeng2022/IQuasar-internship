  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this feasibility study is to assess the initial safety and efficacy of a&#xD;
      novel, intravenously administered cathepsin activatable imaging probe, LUM015, in ex vivo&#xD;
      far-red imaging of colorectal, pancreatic, and esophageal cancers (adenocarcinoma) using the&#xD;
      LUM Imaging Device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will have an established diagnosis of colorectal, pancreatic, or esophageal&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma and are scheduled for resection of their primary tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be seen by their surgeon or endoscopist in an office visit and undergo routine&#xD;
      preoperative testing within eight weeks of their planned procedure. During the pre-procedure&#xD;
      visit a complete history and physical examination and standard of care pre-operative&#xD;
      laboratory studies (including ECG) will be performed. These laboratory values and results of&#xD;
      the history and physical will be used to confirm eligibility. For some patients, a&#xD;
      pre-procedure visit is not required as part of standard treatment. Those patients may have a&#xD;
      study-specific screening and pre-procedure laboratory tests at their local medical center. On&#xD;
      the day of their planned surgery, LUM015 will be administered by bolus intravenous injection.&#xD;
      For colorectal and esophageal cases, LUM015 will be administered 2-6 hours prior to tumor&#xD;
      resection. For pancreatic cases, given the variability in predicting the time to tumor&#xD;
      resection relative to surgical start time, injection will occur 1 hour prior to planned&#xD;
      surgical start time. Patients will be monitored for adverse events until discharged from the&#xD;
      hospital. Follow up of subjects will continue until their first post-operative visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All surgical specimens (whether containing normal tissue or tumor tissue) will be sent to the&#xD;
      pathology suite for imaging with the LUM Imaging Device and routine diagnostic assessment.&#xD;
      Imaged areas showing high fluorescence will be marked to guide pathology evaluation and&#xD;
      determine whether the area contains tumor. Samples of imaged areas showing low fluorescence&#xD;
      signal will also be evaluated by pathology to determine whether the area only contains normal&#xD;
      tissue. After imaging, part of this tissue will be fresh frozen for correlative studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients are expected to be admitted to the hospital for the surgical procedure and&#xD;
      remain in the hospital post-surgery as indicated and required by the surgeon per standard of&#xD;
      care treatment. While in the hospital, patients will be assessed for adverse events.&#xD;
      Laboratory studies will also be performed during this time as a part of routine post-surgical&#xD;
      care and to assess for any imaging agent related adverse events.&#xD;
