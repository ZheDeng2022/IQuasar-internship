  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that&#xD;
      will enroll 1028 patients with at least moderately severe COPD over a three year period and&#xD;
      follow them at regular intervals for one year. The primary endpoint is time to first acute&#xD;
      exacerbation. Secondary endpoints include rates and severity of COPD exacerbations,&#xD;
      cardiovascular events, all-cause mortality, lung function, dyspnea, quality of life and&#xD;
      metoprolol-related side effects.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypothesis The primary hypothesis is that metoprolol succinate will reduce the risk of COPD&#xD;
      exacerbations as compared to placebo. The secondary hypothesis is that metoprolol succinate&#xD;
      will not adversely impact lung function, exercise tolerance, dyspnea or quality of life as&#xD;
      compared to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Flow Patients will be screened and then randomized over a 2 week period and will then&#xD;
      undergo a dose titration period for the following six weeks. Thereafter patients will be&#xD;
      followed for 42 additional weeks on their target dose of metoprolol or placebo followed by a&#xD;
      4 week washout period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary: To determine the effect of once daily metoprolol succinate compared with placebo on&#xD;
      the time to first exacerbation in moderate to severe COPD patients who are prone to&#xD;
      exacerbations and who do not have absolute indications for beta-blocker therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary: To estimate the effect of metoprolol succinate compared with placebo on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The rate and severity of COPD exacerbations over 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Incidence and severity of metoprolol-related side effects including those that require&#xD;
           cessation of drug&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Lung function as assessed by spirometry, dyspnea as assessed by the Modified Medical&#xD;
           Research Council Scale (MMRC) and San Diego Shortness of Breath Questionnaire, exercise&#xD;
           tolerance as measured by six minute walk test (6MWD), and quality of life as assessed by&#xD;
           the Short Form 36, St. Georges Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and COPD Assessment Test&#xD;
           (CAT) and Personal HEART Score.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Hospitalizations&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The rate of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) (defined by cardiovascular death,&#xD;
           hospitalization for myocardial infarction, heart failure, or stroke), percutaneous&#xD;
           coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. All-cause mortality&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary subgroup analyses for 1) cardiovascular risk based on Personal HEART Score and 2)&#xD;
      age greater versus less than 65.&#xD;
