    <textblock>
      This pilot randomized clinical trial studies how well bupropion hydrochloride works compared&#xD;
      with patient's choice for quitting smoking in patients with squamous cell head and neck&#xD;
      cancer undergoing radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy. Bupropion hydrochloride may&#xD;
      help patients quit smoking by enhancing central nervous system neurotransmitters&#xD;
      noradrenergic and dopaminergic release. It is not yet known whether bupropion hydrochloride&#xD;
      is more effective than patient's choice in helping quit smoking in patients with squamous&#xD;
      cell head and neck cancer undergoing radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the proportion of patients who are not smoking (successful quitters) at 12&#xD;
      months post-radiation therapy (RT)/chemotherapy and radiation therapy (CRT) and compare&#xD;
      proportions between the two study arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare the proportion of patients who are not smoking at 6 months post-RT/CRT between&#xD;
      the two study arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Among patients who quit smoking, determine the proportion of patients who experience&#xD;
      smoking relapse at 12 months post-RT/CRT and compare between the two study arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To compare the maximum degree of mucositis and mucositis-related pain during radiation&#xD;
      treatment and the following week post-treatment between the two study arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Determine the impact of study treatment on anxiety, depression and quality of life (QOL)&#xD;
      and compare between two study arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Collect descriptive data assessing smoking status among caregivers and corresponding data&#xD;
      concerning whether smoking relapse occurs in our patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A: Patients receive bupropion hydrochloride orally (PO) for 3 days and then twice daily&#xD;
      (BID) for up to 1 year post RT/CRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B: Patients receive smoking cessation treatment tailored to individual smokers based on&#xD;
      preference, smoking history and contra-indications. Patients are given the choice of one of&#xD;
      the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)-recommended first-line pharmacotherapy&#xD;
      options for smoking cessation comprised of varenicline PO daily for 1 week and then BID for&#xD;
      12 weeks or combination of nicotine patch and acute nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) for 12&#xD;
      weeks. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
      Treatment with varenicline or NRT can be extended up to 6 months to 1 year as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study, patients are followed up for 30 days.&#xD;
