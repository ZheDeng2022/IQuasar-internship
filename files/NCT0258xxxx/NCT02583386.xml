  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine whether an exercise and educational classroom program&#xD;
      can help reduce falls in people with Multiple Sclerosis who fall frequently.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will recruit 94 people with Multiple Sclerosis, who report having fallen at&#xD;
      least twice in the previous 2 months. Participants will be randomized to be placed in either&#xD;
      a group that receives classroom training during the study, or into a wait-listed control&#xD;
      group that will be offered the classroom training after their participation in the study is&#xD;
      completed. All participants will receive mobility and quality of life assessments at&#xD;
      baseline, 9 weeks, 5 months, and 8 months. All participants will be asked to record any falls&#xD;
      they have on falls calendars.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, 30 participants will be randomized to wear electronic fall detectors on their&#xD;
      bodies for the duration of the study. These detectors will record when and where falls occur,&#xD;
      and this data will be compared with the participants' self-reported falls as recorded on the&#xD;
      falls calendars.&#xD;
