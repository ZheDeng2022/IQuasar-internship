    <textblock>
      Approximately 60 subjects from a sample of convenience diagnosed with shoulder arthritis will&#xD;
      be randomized into a two groups. The control group will receive usual medical advice and the&#xD;
      experimental group will be referred to physical therapy for eight visits over 4-week period&#xD;
      of time. At one month, two months, and one year the pain, function, and patient satisfaction&#xD;
      will be compared between the two groups.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a pragmatic, prospective, single blind, randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
      Stratified randomization will be performed to account for those patients that necessitate a&#xD;
      subacromial corticosteroid injection prior to or during the physical therapy intervention.&#xD;
      The diagnosis of primary glenohumeral osteoarthritis will be confirmed by the orthopedic&#xD;
      surgeon involved in the study. All subjects will have radiographs at the time of initial&#xD;
      evaluation (standard medical practice) and magnetic resonance imaging will only be required&#xD;
      at the discretion of the orthopedic surgeon when this modality is necessary to rule out other&#xD;
      shoulder pathologies of concern.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will use a convenient sample of consecutive subjects who meet all inclusion&#xD;
      criteria and present to the shoulder service physicians at UT Southwestern outpatient clinic&#xD;
      with a primary compliant of shoulder pain and stiffness. If appropriate for the study, the&#xD;
      subjects will be referred to physical therapy for additional assessment and care. If&#xD;
      interested in participation, each potential subject will be educated regarding the purpose&#xD;
      and logistics of the study and asked to enroll via informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 25 of the 50 subjects will be seen in the clinic for 6 visits within a 4 week&#xD;
      time frame. All subjects will return for follow-up or phone call at 4, 8, and 52 weeks for&#xD;
      final data collection and outcomes assessment. The last follow-up assessment at one year will&#xD;
      be via phone contact. For those attending physical therapy, the duration of the visits, 1-6,&#xD;
      will last from 30-60 min. The final visit, visit 9, will take 15-30 minutes. The phone call&#xD;
      on the tenth interaction will last 5-10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session 1: Participant Enrollment - Obtainment of consent, HIPPA and health screen. Baseline&#xD;
      dependent variable data will be collection and the subjects will be randomly allocated to one&#xD;
      of the treatment groups. One group will receive usual medical advice including tips on&#xD;
      posture, activity modifications, and symptom control. The other group will initiate the&#xD;
      program of physical therapy outlined below. Subjects allocated to the physical therapy&#xD;
      treatment arm will proceed to a standard physical therapy visit in which they will be&#xD;
      instructed in the initial exercise training and educated on the use exercise log for&#xD;
      assessment of compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session 2-6 (within 4 weeks after session 1): All patients in the experimental group will&#xD;
      receive standardized physical therapy intervention to treat shoulder osteoarthritis including&#xD;
      manual therapy (no more than 2 units, &lt;37 minutes) and standard flexibility and range of&#xD;
      motion exercises. Patient's will also undergo an in clinic assessment of compliance of their&#xD;
      exercise program and appropriate progression of the shoulder strengthening exercises will be&#xD;
      provided. Patients in the control group will not participate in sessions 2-5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Independent Variable:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 Intervention- manual physical therapy and strengthening exercises to the entire upper&#xD;
      quarter, flexibility exercises, range of motion exercises, and usual medical advice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Manual Therapy: joint mobilization to anterior, posterior, and inferior capsule as indicated&#xD;
      at discretion of treating physical therapist&#xD;
&#xD;
      Shoulder Exercise Training:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Adducted ER with towel roll in sitting or standing (&quot;no-money&quot; exercise with concurrent&#xD;
           external rotation)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Supine or standing boxer punch for serratus&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Short arc military press progressing to flexion or scaption as tolerated&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Subscapularis isolation via seated narrow grip internal rotation row&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Horizontal abduction in neutral (wide grip rows)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Compliance to the home exercise program will be assessed using a daily log.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  All therapeutic exercises with include theraband resistance performed 2-3x20/daily&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session 6 (4 weeks after Session 1): Post-Intervention Data Collection and finalization of&#xD;
      the exercise training and self-mobilization protocol for the experimental group. The control&#xD;
      group will return for a repeat of baseline testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session 7 (8 weeks after Session 1): Post-Intervention Data Collection - Re-assessment of&#xD;
      dependent variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session 8 (one year after enrollment): Phone call to collect outcome assessment data&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dependent Variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Numerical pain rating scale at baseline day 28, day 56, and day 365 during scapular&#xD;
           plane shoulder elevation&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Functional Outcome Score: American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeon scale (ASES) questionnaire&#xD;
           and Simple Shoulder Test (SST)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patient's Global Rating of Change (15 point ordinal scale ranging from -7 to +7)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patient self-reported global percentage of improvement (0-100%)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia score&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Internal and External Rotation Range of Motion&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Scapular Elevation strength via manual muscle test&#xD;
