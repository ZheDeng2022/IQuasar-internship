    <textblock>
      Rationale: Recent publications report good results of controlled donation after circulatory&#xD;
      death (DCD) Maastricht category III liver transplantation when strict donor-recipient&#xD;
      matching is applied and ischemia times are kept to a minimum. However a major concern remains&#xD;
      the high rate of biliary complications after transplantation of DCD livers. Non-anastomotic&#xD;
      biliary strictures (NAS) occur in 29% of patients receiving a DCD graft whereas the incidence&#xD;
      of NAS in recipients of donation after brain death (DBD) liver grafts is 11%. NAS are&#xD;
      associated with higher morbidity and increased cost of liver transplantation. Injury to the&#xD;
      biliary epithelium and the peribiliary vascular plexus occurring during donor warm ischemia&#xD;
      and static cold storage (SCS) has been identified as a major risk factor for development of&#xD;
      NAS. Machine perfusion has been proposed as an alternative strategy for organ preservation,&#xD;
      offering the opportunity to improve the quality of the organ by providing oxygen to the&#xD;
      graft. Experimental studies have shown that end-ischemic dual hypothermic oxygenated machine&#xD;
      perfusion (DHOPE) helps liver grafts to recover from ischemia by restoring mitochondrial&#xD;
      function. Moreover, DHOPE has been shown to provide better preservation of peribiliary&#xD;
      vascular plexus of the bile ducts, which could be an important step forward in reducing the&#xD;
      incidence of NAS after transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To study the efficacy of end-ischemic DHOPE in reducing the incidence of NAS&#xD;
      within six months after controlled DCD (Maastricht category III) liver transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: An international, multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled,&#xD;
      interventional, clinical trial with a two parallel arm approach (treatment/control).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Adult patients (≥18 yrs old) undergoing a liver transplantation with a&#xD;
      liver graft procured from a controlled DCD donor (Maastricht category III) with a body weight&#xD;
      ≥40 kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: In the intervention group liver grafts will be subjected to two hours of&#xD;
      hypothermic, oxygenated perfusion at the end of SCS and before implantation. In the control&#xD;
      group donor liver grafts will be preserved in accordance to standard practice by SCS only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: The incidence and severity of symptomatic NAS as diagnosed&#xD;
      by an Adjudication committee (who are blinded for the group assignment) by means of magnetic&#xD;
      resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP).&#xD;

The donor liver is subjected to 2 hours of hypothermic oxygenated perfusion via the portal vein and the supratruncal aorta applied by the Liver Assist®. Before perfusion, the liver is flushed via the portal vein with 1 L Belzer machine perfusion solution. The perfusion is pressure controlled and set to a mean of 25 mmHg (arterial) and 5 mm Hg (portal). The perfusion fluid is 4 L Belzer machine perfusion solution with additional 3 mmol/L glutathione. The perfusion fluid is 12°C, when the temperature is set at 10°C. The oxygen flow is set at 0.5 mL/min of 100% oxygen on each of the two membrane oxygenators.</description>
