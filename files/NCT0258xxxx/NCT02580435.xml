    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory disease that affects the nervous system and&#xD;
      results in a wide range of signs and symptoms including physical and cognitive problems.&#xD;
      Recent evidence demonstrates that interactions between the host immune system and the&#xD;
      commensal gut microbiota have a key role in the development of the disease. However, the&#xD;
      natures of these interactions are poorly studied, and the set of bacteria with pathogenic or&#xD;
      protective potential are unknown. Here, the investigators propose a multi-pronged approach to&#xD;
      deciphering the role of the microbiota in MS, by developing microbiome-based machine learning&#xD;
      algorithms aimed at: (1) distinguishing healthy individuals from MS patients; (2) predicting&#xD;
      the time since the onset of MS in relation to disease activity by predicting next relapse and&#xD;
      neurological progression; (3) identifying microbiome signatures that characterize the relapse&#xD;
      state; (4) distinguishing various MS phenotypes in relation to blood and microbiome&#xD;
      transcriptome signatures; (5) predicting response to various immunomodulatory treatments in&#xD;
      relation to blood and microbiome transcriptome signatures. Overall, these studies should&#xD;
      establish the role of the microbiome in multiple sclerosis, resulting in a set of&#xD;
      non-invasive tools for characterization of the disease; identification of the kinetics of MS&#xD;
      using microbiome as a readout; and allowing the prediction of individuals prone to MS based&#xD;
      on their microbiome and in relation to their protein expression. These new set of diagnostic&#xD;
      and predictive tools may thus add a novel and unexplored dimension to the study of the&#xD;
      disease that may lead in the future to new therapeutic avenues based on designing&#xD;
      microbiome-targeted interventions.&#xD;

      Description of methods and plan of operation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our research plan consists of the following steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Cohort assembly. For each of the above aims the investigators will use the unique&#xD;
           database of the Sheba Medical Center to identify the relevant individuals and invite&#xD;
           them to take part in the study. Prof. Achiron has much experience in conducting many&#xD;
           research projects that utilize the unique patient database available to the Center. For&#xD;
           the first aim comparing MS patients to healthy individuals the investigators will select&#xD;
           sex-, age- and diet-matched healthy individuals, ideally selecting spouses of MS&#xD;
           patients as healthy controls as individuals living in the same environment have more&#xD;
           similar microbiota. In our second aim comparing MS patients with similar time from&#xD;
           diagnosis but different disease severity, the investigators will select MS patients that&#xD;
           span the largest possible spectrum of disease severity as judged by the EDSS score&#xD;
           employed by the Center. For the final aim individuals at high risk of relapse will be&#xD;
           invited for profiling every 6 months and if relapse occurs, they will be profiled upon&#xD;
           their visit to the Center as well as one month after the relapse event.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Cohort profiling. From each patient, the investigators will obtain a multi-dimensional&#xD;
           data from the MS database consisting, as appropriate, of a subset of: (1) Clinical&#xD;
           metadata, including: Consent form; Medications; annual relapse rate; (2) Blood tests,&#xD;
           including a complete blood count, complete biochemistry, lipid profile, cholesterol&#xD;
           profile; (3) Complete neurological examination for obtaining an EDSS score, cognitive&#xD;
           assessment, gait assessment; MRI imaging data, evoked potentials, treatment response;&#xD;
           (4) Blood samples will be processed for protein mRNA expression and peripheral blood&#xD;
           mononuclear cells (PBMCs) will be separated on Ficoll-Hypaque gradient, total RNA&#xD;
           purified, labeled, hybridized to Genechip array (U133A2), and scanned (GeneArray-TM&#xD;
           scanner G2500A; Hewlett Packard) according to the manufacturer's protocol (Affymetrix,&#xD;
           Santa Clara, CA). MAS5 software (Affymetrix) will be used to analyze the scanned arrays&#xD;
           containing ~22,000 gene transcripts corresponding to 14,500 well-annotated human genes.&#xD;
           (5) Gut microbiota profile obtained from stool samples will be processed for shotgun&#xD;
           metagenomic sequencing and 16S rRNA profiling. Gut microbiota profiling will be done&#xD;
           from stool samples that will be immediately flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and&#xD;
           preserved at a minimum of -80°C until further processing. Samples will then be processed&#xD;
           by an automated robotic pipeline that was developed in the Segal lab at Weizmann. This&#xD;
           pipeline works in 96-well format and can extract DNA from 96 stool samples within one&#xD;
           day, prepare DNA Illumina libraries for shotgun metagenomic sequencing within another&#xD;
           day, and carry out multiplexed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the 16S&#xD;
           rRNA gene in another day. Thus, every 96-stool sample group collected can be processed&#xD;
           robotically for both 16S and metagenomic sequencing within 3 days under the supervision&#xD;
           of one lab technician.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Data analysis and algorithmic development. (I) Microbiota: To comprehensively study the&#xD;
           role of the microbiome in MS, the investigators will go much beyond the standard 16S&#xD;
           rRNA analysis and into analysis of full shotgun metagenome samples. By sequencing the&#xD;
           entire DNA content of stool samples, metagenome sequencing can potentially provide much&#xD;
           more information as compared to 16S, as it allows to study genome structure, structural&#xD;
           variants, and gene and metabolic pathway functions. After extracting these features from&#xD;
           the microbiome (see below in Preliminary Results), the investigators will start by&#xD;
           employing basic univariate and multivariate association tests, and continue with more&#xD;
           complex machine learning models that attempt to distinguish individuals with MS from&#xD;
           those without based on microbiome features (aim 1), to classify disease severity (aim&#xD;
           2), to predict relapse risk (aim 3), to differentiate between MS disease phenotypes&#xD;
           i.e., radiologically isolated syndrome (RIS), clinically isolated syndrome (CIS),&#xD;
           relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), primary-progressive MS (PPMS), (aim 4), and to identify&#xD;
           treatment responders (aim 5). (II) Blood: To analyze protein expression Partek Genomics&#xD;
           Software (www.partek.com) will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Univariate and multivariate analyses. The investigators will first compute the&#xD;
           correlation (Pearson and Spearman) between all microbiome features extracted across all&#xD;
           profiled individuals and the different patient measurements (EDSS score, time from&#xD;
           relapse, etc.), and correct for the multiple hypotheses performed. Since the&#xD;
           investigators will generate a vast number of microbiome features and many of them are&#xD;
           highly correlated to each other, this analysis may suffer from lack of statistical&#xD;
           power, especially given that the number of participants will be far smaller than the&#xD;
           number of features. For this reason, the investigators will also perform multivariate&#xD;
           analyses (e.g., singular value decomposition, principal component analysis) since the&#xD;
           key components identified by these methods capture the main variation in the data in a&#xD;
           way that takes into account the internal structure and relationships between the&#xD;
           different input features. The investigators will then test whether projections of the&#xD;
           data by any of the main principal components in this analysis provides a significant&#xD;
           segregation of the participants by their measured metabolic parameters. As a different&#xD;
           type of multivariate analysis, the investigators will also employ different unsupervised&#xD;
           clustering methods (e.g., hierarchical clustering, naïve Bayes) to cluster the&#xD;
           participants by their microbiome feature data, and then examine the clusters for&#xD;
           enrichment in normal or abnormal metabolic parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Machine learning algorithms. As a more global approach aimed at quantifying the overall&#xD;
      contribution of the microbiome to MS and at unraveling the relative contribution of the&#xD;
      different microbiome features, the investigators will classify the study participants into&#xD;
      several groups in each aim (e.g., in aim 1 patients versus healthy individuals; in aim 2&#xD;
      individuals with high versus low EDSS score for the similar time from MS diagnosis), and&#xD;
      develop different computational methods (e.g., boosted decision trees, Support Vector Machine&#xD;
      algorithms (SVMs)) for this classification problem using only the microbiome features&#xD;
      generated above. The investigators will use a cross validation scheme, whereby the model&#xD;
      training is done on the data of a randomly chosen subset of participants and then tested on&#xD;
      the data of the remaining held out participants. In addition, the investigators will leave&#xD;
      aside a test set on which the investigators will evaluate the final model that is derived in&#xD;
      cross validation, allowing a true estimate of the performance of our models. As the number of&#xD;
      microbiome features and thus the number of dimensions is large, the investigators will employ&#xD;
      various feature selection approaches as means of avoiding overfitting and reducing&#xD;
      dimensionality. The Segal lab (Weizmann) has pioneered the development of several such&#xD;
      methods in similar settings in the area of gene regulation. The investigators will also use a&#xD;
      similar scheme to predict the continuous EDSS score representing MS severity. The problem&#xD;
      setup is similar to classification, but the method development is quite different as the&#xD;
      classification methods are replaced with regression type of methods (e.g., linear regression,&#xD;
      probabilistic models, stochastic gradient descent).&#xD;

        The Multiple Sclerosis Center at Sheba Medical Center is currently following and treating&#xD;
        3710 out of ~5000 MS patients in Israel and as such represents a unique opportunity to&#xD;
        unravel the role of the microbiome in MS, since it offers the possibility to identify&#xD;
        multiple subgroups of patients in an attempt to detect microbiome signatures. A total of&#xD;
        520 subjects will be included in the study as is further specified. The data for 100&#xD;
        healthy control subjects will be obtained from the Weizmann DataBank by Prof Eran Segal.&#xD;
