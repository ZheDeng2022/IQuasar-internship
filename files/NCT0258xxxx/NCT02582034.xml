  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a treatment with Therasphere which is&#xD;
      optimized is more efficient compared to a standard treatment for patients suffering from&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinomas.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For patients suffering from hepatocellular carcinoma, a palliative treatment can be proposed&#xD;
      if tumor expansion is limited to the liver. One of palliative treatment is the the Selective&#xD;
      Internal Radiation Therapy (SIRT) with Therasphere®. This treatment is made secure by&#xD;
      performing a diagnostic angiogram coupled with a hepatic perfusion scintigraph with which&#xD;
      patients at risk of complications are identified and excluded. The treatment objective, with&#xD;
      the standard dosimetric approach, is to deliver an absorbed dose of 120 ± 20 Gy to the&#xD;
      treated hepatic volume, most often one lobe. Recent retrospective trials show that an&#xD;
      optimized dosimetric approach, considering the dose absorbed by the tumor, is technically&#xD;
      achievable and would probably make it possible to obtain a better effectiveness. In our&#xD;
      experience, treatment personalisation have been described to be used for 60% of the patients&#xD;
      with a tumor larger than 7 cm underlying the clinical impact of this new approach.&#xD;
