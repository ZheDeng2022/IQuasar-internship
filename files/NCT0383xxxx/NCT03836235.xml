  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The long-term goal of this project is to promote responsible opioid prescribing, immediately&#xD;
      improving patient safety and ultimately decreasing healthcare costs by reducing older adult&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality due to opioid-related injury. The objective of this pilot project is&#xD;
      to gather data to inform the development of the STOP Injury tool and evaluate additional&#xD;
      predictive factors and important outcomes relevant to prescription opioids.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The experience from this project will lay the groundwork on prospective validation of STOP&#xD;
      Injury in a large appropriately powered study. Aim 1 will provide data that will help narrow&#xD;
      inclusion of candidate variables in the STOP Injury tool to include those that are most&#xD;
      feasible to collect and most predictive. Aim 2 will help inform the possible inclusion of&#xD;
      genetic factors into a predictive model. Finally, Aim 3 will help identify quality of life&#xD;
      outcomes that should be considered when assessing opioid medication adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. Evaluate the association between prescription opioid adverse events in older adults&#xD;
      and candidate risk prediction variables proposed for STOP Injury prediction score The study&#xD;
      team will conduct a pilot prospective observational study of 200 patients 50 years or older&#xD;
      who are initiated on opioids from the emergency department (ED). The investigators will&#xD;
      analyze the association between candidate risk factors and opioid adverse events (falls and&#xD;
      OD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. Evaluate the association between prescription opioid adverse events and genetic&#xD;
      factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the cohort from Aim 1, the study team will test subjects for 12 genetic single nucleotide&#xD;
      polymorphisms related to opioid metabolism, transport, and effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3. Measure the impact of opioid medications on quality of life measures in older adults&#xD;
      The investigators will implement a series of quality of life measures on a subset of patients&#xD;
      as a pilot study to determine which measures capture the impact prescription opioids have on&#xD;
      older adults' quality of life&#xD;

        The study will seek to enroll 200 subjects. All patients 50 years or older presenting to UF&#xD;
        JAX ED with pain or a pain-related complaint (i.e., fracture, burn, etc.) will be screened&#xD;
        for eligibility using the inclusion and exclusion criteria listed below. To accomplish Aim&#xD;
        3, the investigators will enroll a convenience subset of patients by approaching every&#xD;
        third subject enrolled with the option to consent for Aim 3.&#xD;
