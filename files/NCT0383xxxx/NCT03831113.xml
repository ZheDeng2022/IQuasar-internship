      This study will evaluate maternal tolerance to several BUP dose reduction strategies.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Opioid use has reached a staggering level and the associated deaths, neonatal consequences&#xD;
      and economic impact are devastating. Pregnancy provides a window of opportunity for women&#xD;
      with an opioid use disorder (OUD) to seek assistance by participating in a program that&#xD;
      offers medication-assisted treatment (MAT), most commonly with buprenorphine (BUP) or&#xD;
      methadone. BUP offers advantages over methadone including ease of administration and less&#xD;
      severe neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) but has a higher discontinuation rate, especially&#xD;
      during induction. The high discontinuation rate may be due to an inadequate dosing as the&#xD;
      current dosing strategies are not informed by pharmacokinetic (PK) or pharmacodynamic (PD)&#xD;
      data in pregnancy. The lack of BUP PD data hampers development of an effective dosing&#xD;
      strategy and challenges the validity of the primary tools used to gauge maternal and infant&#xD;
      withdrawal. Neither the Clinical Opioid Withdrawal Scale (COWS) nor the Finnegan score for&#xD;
      the diagnosis of NAS considers the pharmacology of BUP and therefore may not provide a valid&#xD;
      representation of opioid withdrawal. BUP PD data are critically necessary to address these&#xD;
      issues and are also necessary to develop detoxification regimens. Creation of safe and&#xD;
      effective detoxification regimens requires a pharmacological basis and must be developed in&#xD;
      the context that the brain requires time to adjust to opioid induced changes. In this&#xD;
      proposal, investigators hypothesize that determination of BUP pharmacodynamics will improve&#xD;
      care for the pregnant opioid dependent mother and her baby and will fill the critical&#xD;
      knowledge gaps needed for safe and effective management of women with an OUD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For opioid using women, the diagnosis of NAS is viewed as one of the key outcomes to be&#xD;
      identified since those infants will need treatment for their perceived withdrawal. Neonatal&#xD;
      withdrawal, however, is likely a surrogate for fetal exposure to opioids and not an optimal&#xD;
      means of identifying the long-term effects of opioid exposure. The focus on the diagnosis of&#xD;
      NAS ignores the importance and risks of opioid exposure on the brain of the infant without&#xD;
      NAS. Neuroimaging of the fetal and neonatal brain and neurodevelopmental studies of all&#xD;
      infants exposed to opioids, whether or not they are diagnosed as having NAS, will provide&#xD;
      tangible long-term measures of the effect of opioids. The relationship between fetal in utero&#xD;
      exposure and neonatal outcomes will be explored using maternal and baby hair, placenta, cord&#xD;
      and meconium as indicators of chronic maternal and fetal exposure as these are unaffected by&#xD;
      maternal truthfulness or acute dosing at the time of delivery. We will relate these&#xD;
      indicators of opioid exposure to NAS, as well as to the neuroanatomic and neurodevelopmental&#xD;
      outcomes of opioid exposed infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of the dose reduction clinical trial, investigators will compare dose reduction&#xD;
      strategies for BUP in pregnancy that are based on the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      characteristics of BUP. The dose reduction strategies that will be evaluated in this clinical&#xD;
      trial are part of a larger project including an observational study.&#xD;

    <description>Investigators will monitor plasma levels (ng/ml) of buprenorphine+metabolites (BUP+M), neurotransmitters, and cotinine levels during weekly clinic visits. The subject's weekly plasma concentrations will be compared to the VAS scores to determine the change in mu receptor sensitivity.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>4.5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The VAS questionnaire consists of 4 questions related to cravings, withdrawal, sleep quality and sleep duration. Subjects will complete this questionnaire daily and at the weekly clinic visits. Subjects will grade each category on a scale of 0-100 in increments of 10. The VAS scores will be used within and across groups to evaluate the tolerance of the dose reductions (magnitude and frequency).</description>

    <time_frame>4.5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The COWS questionnaire consists of 11 questions and will be completed at the weekly clinic visits. Responses to each question are graded on a scale of 0-4 and the total of all responses correlates to a particular withdrawal severity: mild (5-12), moderate (13-24), moderately severe (25-36), severe (&gt;36). COWS scores will be used to assess the subject's tolerance to the dose reductions by measuring withdrawal and satiety.</description>

    <time_frame>4.5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The SOWS questionnaire consists of 16 questions and will be completed at the weekly clinic visits. Responses to each question are graded on a scale of 0-4 and the total of all responses correlates to a particular withdrawal severity: mild (1-10), moderate (11-20), severe (21-30). SOWS scores will be used to assess the current subjective symptoms of withdrawal and satiety.</description>

    <measure>Weekly Follow-up Form</measure>
    <time_frame>4.5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The weekly follow-up form consists of 17 questions and will be completed at the weekly clinic visits. Subjects are asked to grade their cravings, withdrawal symptoms, and sleep quality on a scale of 1-10. The form also includes questions regarding which days were the best and worst for cravings, withdrawal and sleep and what the subject did to manage her symptoms.</description>
