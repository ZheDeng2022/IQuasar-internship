  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several lines of evidence place TGF-β, a potent pro-fibrotic cytokine, at the centre of the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of Systemic Sclerosis (SSC). AVID200 is a novel inhibitor of TGF-β ligands. This&#xD;
      Phase 1 trial is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of&#xD;
      AVID200 in SSc patients in order delineate doses to be further evaluated in Phase 2.&#xD;
      Approximately 9 to 24 male and female patients with documented SSc (i.e., score ≥ 9 according&#xD;
      to the American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism classification&#xD;
      criteria), and classified as having the diffuse cutaneous SSs (dcSSc) subset (i.e., according&#xD;
      to the LeRoy and Medsger Classification), will be entered into this Phase 1a, multicentre,&#xD;
      open-label, dose-escalation, cohort study of AVID200.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of sequential escalating doses&#xD;
      of AVID200 (study drug), in order delineate a potential effective range of tolerated doses to&#xD;
      be further evaluated in Phase 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be treated and followed on an outpatient basis throughout the trial, unless&#xD;
      hospitalization is required for other reasons, or to assure patient safety. The choice of&#xD;
      doses for further Phase 2 study will be based on clinical and laboratory data obtained during&#xD;
      this trial, including safety, PK, and preliminary anti-fibrotic activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon completion of Cycle 1, and provided re-treatment criteria are met, patients may receive&#xD;
      up to 2 additional cycles of study drug unless a criterion for treatment discontinuation has&#xD;
      been met.&#xD;
