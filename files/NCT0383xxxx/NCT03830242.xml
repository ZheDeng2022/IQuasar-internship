      The aim of this study is to make up for the gap by performing a dynamic scan of&#xD;
      &lt;Sup&gt;18&lt;Sup&gt;F-FDG PET/CT on newly diagnosed patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma.&#xD;
      Pathological and genomic studies are performed. The differences between metastatic central&#xD;
      lymph nodes images and tissues are compared at the same time. &lt;Sup&gt;18&lt;Sup&gt;F-FDG PET/CT&#xD;
      dynamic imaging is explored in metastatic central lymph nodes with papillary thyroid cancer&#xD;
      for the diagnostic value.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thyroid cancer is the most common malignant tumor in human endocrine system, accounting for&#xD;
      0.2% ~ 1.0% of malignant tumors .According to the global cancer report released by the world&#xD;
      health organization (WHO) in 2014, 50% of the new cases of thyroid cancer are papillary&#xD;
      thyroid cancer (PTC). In recent years, the incidence of thyroid cancer in China shows an&#xD;
      increasing trend, especially the composition ratio of thyroid micro-papillary carcinoma with&#xD;
      the focal diameter &lt;1 cm increases rapidly.Although PTC has a good prognosis, according to a&#xD;
      Meta analysis , PTC lymph node metastasis rate is as high as 28.0%.The central lymph node is&#xD;
      the most common metastatic site of papillary thyroid carcinoma.In addition, it has been&#xD;
      reported in literature that lymph nodes in the central region are the first stop of thyroid&#xD;
      papillary carcinoma metastasis (i.e., sentinel lymph nodes), and lymph nodes metastatic to&#xD;
      this point are prone to infringe the peripheral esophagus, trachea and recurrent laryngeal&#xD;
      nerve at an early stage.A large number of clinical cases have confirmed that lymph node&#xD;
      metastasis of thyroid cancer significantly increases the local recurrence rate after&#xD;
      surgery.More studies have shown that regional lymph node metastasis increases&#xD;
      mortality.Therefore, the treatment of lymph node metastasis should not be ignored in PTC&#xD;
      patients.However, at present, preoperative imaging has certain limitations in the judgment of&#xD;
      lymph node metastasis in the central region : ultrasound has advantages in the judgment of&#xD;
      lymph node metastasis in the peripheral group, but poor display in the central group.Although&#xD;
      MRI scan of head and neck can be multi-directional and multi-sequence imaging, and the&#xD;
      resolution of soft tissue is high, it is not good at showing calcification.Conventional CT&#xD;
      alone based on lymph node morphology to determine metastasis also has some&#xD;
      limitations;Positron emission tomography (PET) sensitivity was &lt; 40%.Although one study&#xD;
      showed that the probability of non-missed diagnosis of lymph nodes in central PTC region by&#xD;
      thin slice CT scan was 100%, the specificity was low and the study was&#xD;
      retrospective.Therefore, b-ultrasound, MRI, CT, PET and other auxiliary examinations have not&#xD;
      been able to effectively detect all central metastatic lymph nodes before surgery.For&#xD;
      management of cervical lymph nodes ,2015 American Thyroid Association（ATA） guidelines show&#xD;
      that thyroid+therapeutic Ⅵ area lymph node dissection should be undertaken if in central or&#xD;
      lateral lymph nodes are involved.Chinese guidelines recommend that, in order to avoid&#xD;
      operative complications as far as possible (i.e. effective retainment of the parathyroid&#xD;
      gland and recurrent laryngeal nerve), regardless of the size of the primary thyroid lesion,&#xD;
      lymph node dissection in the central area on the same side of the lesion should be performed&#xD;
      at least.However, in 2017, the second edition of National Comprehensive Cancer Network(NCCN)&#xD;
      thyroid tumor guidelines believed that if lymph nodes in the central region were negative,&#xD;
      preventive central region lymph node dissection was not recommended.Above all，there is so&#xD;
      much controversy over lymph node dissection in the central region. Therefore，it is of great&#xD;
      significance to effectively evaluate the preoperative lymph nodes station in the central&#xD;
      region of thyroid papillary carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early dynamic imaging examination of &lt;Sup&gt;18&lt;Sup&gt;F-FDG PET/CT can be defined as a imaging&#xD;
      method to detect the status of radioactive tracer (&lt;Sup&gt;18&lt;Sup&gt;F-FDG) which travels with the&#xD;
      blood flow and is continuously absorbed and excreted by organs (or diseased) tissues after&#xD;
      being introduced into the body in the early stage.This development reflects the change of&#xD;
      &lt;Sup&gt;18&lt;Sup&gt;F-FDG activity with time in the early stage of entering the body, and can provide&#xD;
      information about the dynamic change of tracer metabolism and distribution in tissues with&#xD;
      time, so that it can provide more metabolic and distribution details of tumor lesions and&#xD;
      metastatic lesions than static scanning.At present, many studies have shown that&#xD;
      &lt;Sup&gt;18&lt;Sup&gt;F-FDG PET/CT early dynamic imaging technology can effectively improve the&#xD;
      sensitivity of hepatocellular carcinoma ,renal cell carcinoma and other tumors.More&#xD;
      amazing，there may be more advantages in evaluating lymph node metastasis.The blood supply of&#xD;
      lymph nodes metastatic of thyroid papillary carcinoma is abundant, which helps to locate the&#xD;
      metastatic tumor lymph node.However，there is no relevant study.Now , investigators plan to&#xD;
      observe the significance of the method to evaluate the central lymph node metastasis in&#xD;
      thyroid papillary carcinoma as well as the intrinsic correlations between the significance&#xD;
      and postoperative pathological results ,which may help to develop surgical strategy by&#xD;
      preoperative evaluation and avoiding additional dissection.&#xD;
