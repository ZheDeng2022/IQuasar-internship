      Primary Objective The objective is to determine the feasibility and agreement of remote&#xD;
      evaluation of resting heart rate and HRV using the commercially available WHOOP® wrist&#xD;
      monitor, compared to in-office measurements using AtCor Medical SphygmoCor HRV Software, in a&#xD;
      cohort of 40 St. Jude Life Study participants with a history of mantle radiation for&#xD;
      management of Hodgkin lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elucidating the mechanisms that contribute to adverse cardiovascular outcomes and reduced&#xD;
      quality of life among the growing population of childhood cancer survivors is paramount.&#xD;
      Cancer, certain cancer drugs, radiation therapy, cancer-associated lifestyle disturbances,&#xD;
      and cancer-independent comorbidities combine to predispose cancer survivors to autonomic&#xD;
      dysfunction (AD). Reduced heart rate variability (HRV) has been described in various cancer&#xD;
      cohorts. Furthermore, these markers of AD have been implicated in adverse outcomes in&#xD;
      oncology patients, including increased mortality, exercise limitation, and fatigue. However,&#xD;
      data are largely derived from small studies with methodological limitations, and the&#xD;
      contribution of AD to overall morbidity and mortality in cancer survivors is not well&#xD;
      understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective is to determine the feasibility and agreement of remote evaluation of resting&#xD;
      heart rate and HRV using the commercially available WHOOP® wrist monitor, compared to&#xD;
      in-office measurements using AtCor Medical SphygmoCor HRV Software, in a cohort of 40 St.&#xD;
      Jude Life Study participants with a history of mantle radiation for management of Hodgkin&#xD;
      lymphoma.&#xD;

      At St. Jude Children's Research Hospital survivors who meet the eligibility criteria will be&#xD;
      identified from SJLIFE participants and contacted for potential participation via phone. If&#xD;
      the SJLIFE participant expresses interest they will be e-mailed or faxed a copy of the&#xD;
      consent form; the consent conference will occur via phone and e-mail or facsimile will be&#xD;
      used to document informed consent. Once the consent signature page is received and the&#xD;
      participant is enrolled on study, a WHOOP® wrist monitor and directions for wearing the&#xD;
      device will be mailed to the participant. Feasibility will be assessed by evaluating how many&#xD;
      participants wear and return the device with enough data for analysis. The investigator will&#xD;
      consider the project feasible if 30 of 40 participants have 3 hours of usable data after&#xD;
      removal of noise. Upon arrival at St. Jude for the St Jude LIFE study, the participant will&#xD;
      undergo in-office measurement of HRV while also wearing the WHOOP® device. A standard&#xD;
      10-minute electrocardiogram recording will be performed with the participant in a supine&#xD;
      position, with a regular and calm breathing pattern in a quiet room. The standard deviation&#xD;
      of normal RR intervals (SDNN, msec) will be derived from SphygmoCor HRV Software. SDNN during&#xD;
      this 10-minute time period will be derived from WHOOP® HRV software. Agreement between&#xD;
      measures of SDNN derived by the two techniques will be assessed. A mean discrepancy of &lt;20&#xD;
      msec for SDNN measured by the two methods will be considered acceptable agreement.&#xD;
