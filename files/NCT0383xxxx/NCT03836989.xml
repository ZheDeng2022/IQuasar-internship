  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A feasibility pilot study to exam the necessary methodology for conducting a larger clinical&#xD;
      trial for Bell's Palsy patients with a poor prognosis and the use of electrical stimulation.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Here we describe a protocol for a prospective, randomized, double-blinded study to evaluate&#xD;
      the effects of monophasic pulsed current ES on patients with Bell's palsy and factors&#xD;
      predicting poor recovery, with a 6 month follow up. Motor level stimulation with a pulse&#xD;
      duration of 100 μsec and a frequency of 35 pulses per second were chosen from focus group&#xD;
      with physical therapist to treat facial paralysis and are consistent with clinical trials&#xD;
      showing motor benefit after capel tunnel surgery.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Recovery at 3 Months as Measured From Facial Photos With Different Facial Expressions</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate for complete recovery, standardized photos of patients at rest, and during movement, will be evaluated by three treatment-blinded otolaryngologists. Total number of patients fully recovered over number of participants will be reported.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>House Brackmann Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Determined by three blinded otolaryngologist reviewing facial photos of patients with smile and eye closure. Reported as an average of the three scores. The scales ranges from 1 (normal) to 6 (most severe dysfunction)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Reported Quality of Life in Relation to Facial Synkinesis Measured by the Synkinesis Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life is in part measured in this study using the patient reported Synkinesis Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ). The instrument consisting of 10 items asks participants how difficult certain facial activities are. Based on the average score for each domain the test gives a score between 20 (no synkinesis) to 100 (severe synkinesis, all the time).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Reported Global Quality of Life Specific to Facial Paralysis</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by the validated quality of life patient reported questionnaire Facial Clinimetric Evaluation (FaCE) Scale with a scale from 0 (normal) to 100 (severe dysfunction). The scale encompasses facial movement, facial comfort, oral function, eye comfort, lacrimal control, and social function.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective Measurements of Brow Elevation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and in 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Measuring brow elevation using the MEEI FACE-gram program reported as the millimeters in decreased elevation in comparison to the unaffected side</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Eye Closure</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Measuring in millimeters of the eyelids remaining open during maximal eye closure using the MEEI FACE-gram program</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Smile Excursion</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Measuring oral commissure exclusion using the MEEI FACE-gram program reported as the change in millimeters in the distance between the midline of the lower lip and the oral commissure in comparison between rest and smile</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Facial Symmetry at Rest</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by facial asymmetry index (FAI) at rest in photos which is calculated as the difference in the distance from the lateral canthus to the oral commissure between the affected and unaffected side. In the scale 0 equals no difference between sides and perfect symmetry. The closer a number is to 0, the higher the symmetry is. Ranges have not been published for this scale. FAI does not have a maximum score.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Facial Symmetry During Smile</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by facial asymmetry index (FAI) during smile in photos which is calculated as the difference in the distance from the lateral canthus to the oral commissure between the affected and unaffected side. In the scale 0 equals perfect symmetry and no difference in sides. The closer a number is to 0, the greater the symmetry. Ranges have not been published for this scale. FAI does not have a maximum score.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Tolerability</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by a visual analog scale (VAS) which ranged from 0 to 10 where 0 stands for completely comfortable and 10 to very uncomfortable. A questionnaire designed by research team using a Likert's scale was created to measure patient tolerability.</description>

The cathode will be placed on the ipsilateral muscle to stimulate and the anode over the ipsilateral mastoid region.&#xD;

    <participant_flow>
      <pre_assignment_details>Blocks were designed to account for predictors of recovery. There were four allocation blocks: 1) &gt;60 age with complete paralysis, 2) &gt; 60 age with incomplete paralysis, 3) &lt;60 age with complete paralysis and &lt; 15 days duration, or 4) &lt;60 age with complete paralysis and &gt;15 days duration.&#xD;
The block size was 2 and the allocation was 1:1. All patients were randomly allocated to high-volt arm</pre_assignment_details>
