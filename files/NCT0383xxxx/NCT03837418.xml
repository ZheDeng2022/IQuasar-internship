  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to create a human-readable and executable computer language to&#xD;
      implement medical prescriptions and to evaluate and refine this language, with the goal of&#xD;
      improving safety and efficacy of patient care&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preventable errors in healthcare are a leading cause of patient injury and death. Despite&#xD;
      extensive effort and the expenditure of billions of dollars, computerization has failed to&#xD;
      solve this problem. Research has shown that software design and debugging of a paper&#xD;
      prescription markedly decreases the rate of injury and death associated with use of opioids&#xD;
      in hospitalized patients. To further the application of insights from software engineering to&#xD;
      the practice of medicine, the PIs will design and build a Patient-Oriented Prescription&#xD;
      Programming Language (POP-PL) and evaluate if this new platform can be used to improve&#xD;
      medical management of patients. The design of POP-PL will be based on building an&#xD;
      understanding of the process of medical treatment of patients. This project is a&#xD;
      collaboration between computer scientists and clinicians at Northwestern Medicine. The&#xD;
      collaborating clinicians are co-investigators on this research project and also are providing&#xD;
      healthcare to the patients that are being observed. The computer scientists and other&#xD;
      research staff have undergone human subjects research training and are co-investigators on&#xD;
      this research project as well. The clinician-investigators will oversee research project&#xD;
      staff during all observations of patients, clinical encounters between healthcare providers&#xD;
      and patients, and interactions between healthcare providers and healthcare information&#xD;
      systems. Researchers involved in this study will observe interactions between health care&#xD;
      providers and patients and will collate these observations with data from electronic data&#xD;
      sources. Since this research is based mainly upon observation and chart review and will not&#xD;
      involve any interventions or changes to patient care, the risk to study participants is&#xD;
      minimal, involving inadvertent disclosure of healthcare information. This risk will be&#xD;
      mitigated by anonymizing collected data.&#xD;

    <description>Investigators will express the intent of prescriptions in prescription programming language. Investigators will then compare the actual performance of the prescription in a clinical environment to the performance of the prescription in a simulated environment based on the same inputs as occurred in the real clinical environment.</description>
