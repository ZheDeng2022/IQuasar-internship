      This phase I trial studies the side effects of intratumoral injection of SD-101 and&#xD;
      BMS-986178 in treating patients with solid malignancies that have spread to other places in&#xD;
      the body. The TLR9 agonist SD-101 may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop&#xD;
      cancer cells from growing. BMS-986178 is a monoclonal anti-OX40 antibody that enhances the&#xD;
      activation of T cells, immune cells that are important for fighting tumors. Giving TLR9&#xD;
      agonist SD-101 together with anti-OX40 antibody BMS-986178 may work better in treating&#xD;
      patients with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of intratumoral TLR9 agonist SD-101 (SD-101) in&#xD;
      combination with intratumoral and intravenous anti-OX40 antibody BMS 986178 (BMS-986178) in&#xD;
      patients with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the efficacy of treatment with intratumoral SD 101 in combination with&#xD;
           intratumoral and intravenous BMS 986178 in patients with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate changes in pharmacodynamic endpoints in serial tumor biopsies from I TUMOR&#xD;
           treated and untreated sites of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAFETY COHORT: Patients receive TLR9 agonist SD-101 intratumorally (IT) on days 1, 8 and 15.&#xD;
      Patients also receive anti-OX40 antibody BMS 986178 IT on days 8 and 15, and intravenously&#xD;
      (IV) over 30 minutes on days 8, 29 and 58.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPANSION COHORT: Patients receive TLR9 agonist SD-101 IT on days 1, 8 and 15. Patients also&#xD;
      receive anti-OX40 antibody BMS 986178 IT on days 1, 8 and 15, and IV over 30 minutes on days&#xD;
      1, 29 and 58.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3-6 months.&#xD;

             approved should have received such therapy prior to enrollment, with evidence of&#xD;
             progression on at least two scans (ie, with pseudoprogression ruled out). Patients&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential must practice a highly effective method of birth&#xD;
