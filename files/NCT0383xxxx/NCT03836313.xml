      This is a prospective, randomized control trial to evaluate the impacts of preoperative&#xD;
      cryoneurolysis treatment on opioid consumption with prehabilitation and resulting&#xD;
      postoperative functional improvement in patients undergoing elective primary total knee&#xD;
      arthroplasty (TKA).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients eligible for the study will be undergoing elective primary TKA at Brigham and&#xD;
      Women's Hospital in Boston, MA. Study participants which meet the inclusion criteria listed&#xD;
      above will be introduced to the study by a member of the research team in clinic when they&#xD;
      schedule their date for surgery. If patients do not schedule an exact date for surgery at the&#xD;
      time of their clinic visit, a member of the research team will still discuss the study with&#xD;
      the patient so they can be called to schedule iovera° treatment once they schedule their&#xD;
      surgical date. Patients who are interested in the study will be asked for permission to be&#xD;
      contacted by a member of the study staff by telephone. These patients who give permission to&#xD;
      be contacted about the study further will be called on the telephone 4-8 weeks in advance of&#xD;
      their surgical date to assess them for their eligibility. If patients agree to participate in&#xD;
      the study, they will be randomized to receive or not receive preoperative iovera° treatment.&#xD;
      If the patient is eligible and agrees to participate in the study, the patient will come into&#xD;
      clinic where informed consent will be obtained in-person at that time by a physician&#xD;
      investigator and the patient will then receive cryoneurolysis iovera° treatment by a trained&#xD;
      member of the study staff. Dr. Antonia Chen, Mei Xu (Dr. Chen's Physician Assistant), Dr.&#xD;
      Wolfgang Fitz, Dr. Jeffrey Lange, Dr. Thomas Thornhill, Dr. Richard Iorio, Dr.Vivek Shah,&#xD;
      Pierre-Emmanuel Schwab, and Brielle Antonelli will undergo an in-depth and personalized&#xD;
      training session with a representative from Myoscience Inc. who will meet with these members&#xD;
      in clinic in-person and review the device, the treatment procedure, and bring supplies so&#xD;
      these specific members of the study staff can practice administering cryoneurolysis treatment&#xD;
      before beginning the study on patients. Demographic information will be collected including&#xD;
      the patient name, medical record number, date of birth, age, height and weight, gender,&#xD;
      primary language, marital status, living situation, body mass index (BMI), preoperative&#xD;
      narcotic consumption, and existing comorbidities. Randomization of patients for treatment&#xD;
      will occur via randomized computer assignments. Patients will be randomly assigned to either&#xD;
      the iovera° treatment group or the standard of care (SOC) group with a randomization ratio of&#xD;
      1:1. Patients will come in one month prior to surgery to receive prehabilitation treatment&#xD;
      with physical therapy and undergo physical tests including quadriceps strength, timed up and&#xD;
      go test (TUG), single leg stance, balance, and timed horizontal leg hold (quadriceps&#xD;
      endurance test). Patients will also fill-out patient reported outcome measures (PROMs), such&#xD;
      as KOOS, PROMIS 10, visual analog scale (VAS), the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS), and&#xD;
      EQ-5D. The first functional test and completion of PROMs will occur before iovera° treatment&#xD;
      takes place at the first visit when subjects come into the clinic to receive iovera°&#xD;
      treatment. The second functional test and completion of PROMs will occur on subject's day of&#xD;
      surgery before the procedure, and the third set of functional test and completion of PROMs&#xD;
      will be postoperatively at the subject's follow-up visit in clinic between 2-6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The iovera° device is FDA approved (510(k) [#K142866]) for treatment of peripheral nerves for&#xD;
      pain and for treatment of the pain and symptoms of knee osteoarthritis for up to 90 days&#xD;
      (K161835). This device will be used according to its FDA labeling in patients with pain -&#xD;
      hence why they are having a knee replacement, which would be pain due to osteoarthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cryoneurolysis treatment using the iovera° device targeting the anterior femoral cutaneous&#xD;
      nerve (AFCN) and the infrapatellar branch of the saphenous nerve (ISN) will occur&#xD;
      approximately 4 weeks before surgery by a trained member of the study staff (as mentioned&#xD;
      above). Treatment will occur in the clinic setting using suggested anatomical markings to&#xD;
      target appropriate the AFCN and infrapatellar branch of the saphenous nerve (ISN) of the&#xD;
      operative knee. Patients are not sedated and will be asked to identify the painful locations&#xD;
      with one finger which will be marked. The study staff member administering treatment will&#xD;
      push on these locations to confirm that the marked areas are where the patient experiences&#xD;
      pain and responds regarding their sensation and cessation of the pain signaling. This will&#xD;
      confirm the correct location for the investigators which will also be confirmed with the&#xD;
      aforementioned anatomical locations of the appropriate nerve branches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The iovera° device contains three 27- gauge needles, all 6.9mm in length which will indent&#xD;
      the subjects' skin and be inserted under the subcutaneous fat about 7 mm. Other tissues which&#xD;
      may be impacted in addition to the subcutaneous fat are the dermis and epidermis. Muscle is&#xD;
      rarely involved. Given that the needles are only 6.9mm in length, there is minimal&#xD;
      possibility of reaching and affecting fascia, muscle, or vascular structures in the area&#xD;
      which will be treated. All of these tissues impacted, subcutaneous fat are the dermis and&#xD;
      epidermis, recover or are unaffected by the cooling based on the safety profile of safety&#xD;
      profile of cryoanalgesia. Some patients who may have variations in anatomy, particularly in&#xD;
      thickness of subcutaneous fat, will undergo the same procedure, but the investigator will&#xD;
      push the handpiece down to displace the subcutaneous fat. Furthermore, surgeons in this&#xD;
      practice exercise a patient BMI cut off of 40 kg/m2, which will minimize the amount of&#xD;
      subcutaneous fat. Lidocaine will be used for superficial anesthetic at the treatment site&#xD;
      before the needled puncture the patient's skin and no additional nerve block will be used at&#xD;
      this time. Each subject will undergo a total of 9 treatments, or cooling cycles, using the&#xD;
      iovera° device since each nerve branch has 2-3 sites per branch due to the anatomy of these&#xD;
      nerve branches determined using determined anatomical markings. Treatment will be performed&#xD;
      unilaterally and will be guided by visualization and palpation of anatomical landmarks. With&#xD;
      there being 3 nerve branches with about 3 treatment sites per branch, the total number of&#xD;
      treatments per subject is 9 with each treatment lasting about 1 minute, totaling 9-10 minutes&#xD;
      of active treatment. The amount of time estimated for the entire treatment is 20 minutes.&#xD;
      Investigators will know that they are hitting the targeted nerve since the subject is not&#xD;
      sedated and can report a parasthesia response in real-time when the nerve is frozen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical data including date of surgery, laterality, anesthesia type, pericapsular&#xD;
      injections, tourniquet (yes/no), morphine equivalents used in hospital, and discharge&#xD;
      location will be collected for each participant. All other standard of care FDA approved&#xD;
      medications and nerve blocks will be used in the operating room and postoperatively as needed&#xD;
      depending upon the need of each individual patient as determined by the surgeon. These&#xD;
      medications and nerve blocks commonly include bupivacaine, ropivacaine, toradol, clonidine,&#xD;
      epinephrine, meloxicam, tylenol, oxycodone, vicodin, percocet, tramadol, toradol, dilaudid,&#xD;
      morphine, lyrica, celebrex, and gabapentin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive a standard 7 days of opioid medication with 40 pills after&#xD;
      surgery. Subjects will be instructed to take their prescribed pain medication (Oxycodone&#xD;
      5-10mg or dilaudid 1-2mg) every 4-6 hours as need. Surveys distributed through RedCap will be&#xD;
      sent to each patient daily via email to track and monitor opioid consumption and physical&#xD;
      therapy sessions daily, once a day preoperatively with 7 short questions for approximately 4&#xD;
      weeks (from their iovera° treatment until their scheduled date of surgery), and once a day&#xD;
      postoperatively with 10 short questions for 6 weeks for a total of 70 surveys per patient for&#xD;
      the entire study. Each survey should take no longer than a few minutes to complete. Follow-up&#xD;
      visits will take place at 2-6 weeks after surgery for every participant, with one more survey&#xD;
      follow-up at 12 weeks. At each follow-up visit, participants will undergo the same&#xD;
      preoperative physical tests and fill-out each PROM. The postoperative data that will be&#xD;
      collected will consist of physical therapy utilized, narcotic consumption (morphine&#xD;
      equivalents), if patients used opioid medication 60 days prior to surgery or not, time to&#xD;
      return to activities of daily living, time off of assistive walking devices, and 90-day&#xD;
      complications (readmission, reoperation, emergency room visits) which will determine&#xD;
      estimated financial costs of both treatment groups. The investigators will follow patients&#xD;
      postoperatively to evaluate their pain scores to determine if there are differences in pain&#xD;
      scores between the SOC group and the iovera° group and to specifically see if there is&#xD;
      increased pain in the iovera° group.&#xD;

KOOS assesses short and long term patient satisfaction and pain after knee injury/ surgery associated with primary osteoarthritis. KOOS is scored using 5 subscales (pain, symptoms, activities of daily living, sport / recreational activity, and quality of life. Each subcategory is scored from 0 (no problems) to 4 (extreme problems). Those scores are determined as the sum of included items per subcomponent. These scores are converted to a 0-100 scale with 0 being extreme problems and 100 representing no knee problems.</description>
