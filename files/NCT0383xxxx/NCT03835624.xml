      The aim of this study is to measure serum and synovial fluid levels of IL 33 and its relative&#xD;
      mRNA expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA)&#xD;
      patients and to correlate it with the clinical and laboratory characteristics, disease&#xD;
      activity and musculoskeletal ultrasound findings.&#xD;

    <description>The JADAS-27 (range 0-57) was computed by summing the scores of four core-set criteria [3]: physician's global assessment of disease activity (PGA) on a 10 cm visual analogue scale (VAS); parent/patient global assessment of well-being on a 10 cm VAS [7]; active arthritis, defined as joint swelling or limitation of movement accompanied by pain and tenderness, assessed in 27 joints; and ESR (mm/h) normalized to a 0-10 scale, using the formula ESR - 20/10, whereby, before the calculation, ESR values &lt;20 mm/h were converted to 0 and ESR values &gt;120 mm/h were converted to 120. A higher JADAS-27 indicates higher disease activity and a lower JADAS-27 indicates lower disease activity</description>
