      Single-arm, open-label window-of-opportunity trial of neoadjuvant Abemaciclib in 20 patients,&#xD;

      A Window-of-Opportunity Trial of Abemaciclib followed by radical cystectomy in patients with&#xD;
      Platinum-Ineligible Urothelial Carcinoma to Evaluate CDK4/6-Dependent Phosphorylation of&#xD;
      Pocket Proteins and Clonal Evolution Dynamics. Subjects will be treated with Abemaciclib at&#xD;
      200 mg every 12 hours for at least 4 weeks (and likely slightly longer depending upon&#xD;
      surgical date). Individual dose reductions will be made on the basis of the AEs observed. In&#xD;
      the absence of treatment delays due to adverse event(s), treatment will be continued until&#xD;
      the surgical date unless any of the following criteria applies: 1-Disease progression;&#xD;
      2-Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment; 3-Unacceptable&#xD;
      adverse event(s) as a result of Abemaciclib; 4- Patient decides to withdraw from the study;&#xD;
      5-General or specific changes in the patient's condition render the patient unacceptable for&#xD;
      further treatment in the judgment of the investigator. Patients will be followed with&#xD;
      history, physical, and blood tests at each visit to monitor for toxicity. Patients will be&#xD;
      followed for survival endpoints following completion of this study for 3 years after surgery&#xD;
      or until death. Patients removed from study for unacceptable adverse events will be followed&#xD;
      until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event.&#xD;
