  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess the accuracy of a novel urine test for diagnosing urinary tract&#xD;
      infections in acutely ill children presenting to ambulatory care. The accuracy of this novel&#xD;
      test will be compared to the accuracy of conventional dipstick testing. In addition, the&#xD;
      evidence on urine tests will be added to the existing algorithm for diagnosing serious&#xD;
      infections in children. Finally, the study aims to describe the relation between the CRP&#xD;
      level at study entry and the duration of symptoms and final diagnosis over the following 30&#xD;
      days.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The design is a cross-sectional cohort study with a nested longitudinal follow-up in acutely&#xD;
      children presenting to ambulatory care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cross-sectional cohort study will compare an innovative urine test with conventional&#xD;
      dipstick testing to establish their relative accuracy to diagnose urinary tract infections,&#xD;
      and construct an algorithm consisting of clinical features, urine test results and CRP&#xD;
      point-of-care testing to identify serious infections. The longitudinal follow-up study will&#xD;
      describe illness trajectories of children with an intermediate CRP test result (5-80 mg/L) at&#xD;
      first contact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will run in general practices and community paediatrics in Flanders. Recruitment to&#xD;
      the study is expected to last 18 months, with each patient entering the study only once.&#xD;
      Children and their parents/guardians will be approached for possible participation in the&#xD;
      study by practice staff. There is only one study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those who agree to participation via written informed consent will have demographics and&#xD;
      clinical features recorded. All children will be asked to provide a urine sample on study&#xD;
      entry. Subsequently, CRP point-of-care testing will be conducted in all children testing&#xD;
      positive on a clinical prediction rule, and in a random sample of children testing negative&#xD;
      on that rule. Follow-up information for all children will be collected using general practice&#xD;
      notes, hospital records and direct patient/parent contact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment and other management decisions will be left to the treating physicians' discretion.&#xD;
