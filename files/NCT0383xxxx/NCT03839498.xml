      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the response rate (RR) of metastatic or locally advanced&#xD;
      pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma to axitinib administered daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the progression-free survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In an exploratory manner examine the extent of activation of the VEGFR pathway in&#xD;
           pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma using a semi-quantitative immunohistochemistry assay and&#xD;
           examine the relationship with response to therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Perform pharmacogenomics analyses of drug metabolism and transport proteins through&#xD;
           germline DNA examination.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The long-term survival for malignant pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma (PHEO/PGL) may be limited&#xD;
      because of its hormonal effects as well as its aggressive behavior and dissemination,&#xD;
      particularly in some hereditary PHEO/PGL. Although several therapeutic modalities have been&#xD;
      used to palliate malignant PHEO/PGL, a continued search for new agents to address the&#xD;
      malignancy is needed to improve outcomes. One approach is to utilize drugs that target&#xD;
      signaling pathways leading to decreased proliferation and survival of cancer cells. Some data&#xD;
      in the literature suggests that in malignant PHEO/PGL, VEGF seems to play a role in the&#xD;
      biology of the cancer and thus, its inhibition could reduce tumor growth. Sunitinib and&#xD;
      imatinib has been used in a limited number of malignant pheochromocytomas with varying&#xD;
      responses. Axitinib was designed to inhibit VEGFR that participates in tumor angiogenesis. In&#xD;
      order to determine the activity of axitinib in tumor and hormonal responses in malignant&#xD;
      PHEO/PGL, it will be used as a single agent in this study. The combination of&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide; vincristine and dacarbazine have been shown to produce partial responses in&#xD;
      malignant PHEO/PGL. The majority of the patients may have already received this combination&#xD;
      or will receive this combination chemotherapy in the future. The goal is to develop multiple&#xD;
      lines of effective treatments for this disease.&#xD;

             phenobarbital, phenytoin, amobarbital, nevirapine, primidone, rifabutin, rifampin, and&#xD;
             St. John's wort).&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Active seizure disorder or evidence of brain metastases, spinal cord compression, or&#xD;
             carcinomatous meningitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any of the following within 12 months prior to study drug administration: myocardial&#xD;
             infarction, uncontrolled angina, coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft, symptomatic&#xD;
             congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic attack and&#xD;
             within 6 months before study drug administration for deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary&#xD;
             embolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition, or laboratory&#xD;
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study&#xD;
             drug administration, or may interfere with the interpretation of study results, and in&#xD;
             the judgment of the investigator would make the patient inappropriate for entry into&#xD;
             this study.&#xD;
