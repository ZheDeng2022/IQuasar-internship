  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We propose to investigate effects of HP and HC weight loss diets in Newly Diagnosed T2DM&#xD;
      (NT2DM) women and men for 6 months for remission of Type 2 Diabetes. Our long term goal is to&#xD;
      establish a weight loss diet plan for remission of NT2DM which would be adaptable for use in&#xD;
      physicians' clinics and metabolomics predictors for assessment of remission. The overall&#xD;
      objective of this study is to determine if remission of NT2DM can be induced by dietary&#xD;
      manipulation using a HP diet and the pathobiology of this remission. We hypothesize that&#xD;
      NT2DM subjects will have remission to NGT on the HP diet when they are provided the food and&#xD;
      daily menus for compliance. The rationale is the HP diet is palatable for subjects to&#xD;
      continue after the 6 month study and stay in remission using diet plans we provide. We will&#xD;
      compare the effects of the HP vs HC diet on remission. Specific aims of this study are to&#xD;
      determine the effects of the HP and HC diets on NT2DM obese subjects in a 6 month feeding&#xD;
      study and determine: (a)remission of NT2DM to Normal Glucose Tolerance(NGT), (b)weight loss,&#xD;
      (c)improvements in metabolic markers, Cardiovascular Risk Factors(CVR), and inflammation&#xD;
      markers, and epigenetic DNA methylation changes and pathways involved with remission and&#xD;
      metabolomic markers to establish predictive markers of remission of NT2DM. We propose to use&#xD;
      a non-pharmaceutical means (HP diet) for remission of T2DM and weight loss and determine the&#xD;
      pathobiology involved in improvement in metabolic and CVRs by interrogating the samples with&#xD;
      emerging technologies. The proposed research is significant because if we can demonstrate the&#xD;
      HP diet cause remission of NT2DM to NGT along with other metabolic improvements, it would be&#xD;
      a significant improvement in health risk and medical cost to subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Greater than 30 million people have diabetes. Over time diabetic patients need more and more&#xD;
      medications and develop numerous medical complications. Remission of Type 2 Diabetes (T2DM)&#xD;
      would have profound effects on people with diabetes with respect to overall health&#xD;
      improvement (insulin sensitivity(Si), cardiovascular risk factors(CVR), inflammation markers&#xD;
      (IC)), reduction of retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy and reduction in medical costs.&#xD;
      Methods to accomplish this have not yet been determined, however, it is generally accepted&#xD;
      that non-drug methods to treat T2DM is the most cost effective and have the fewest side&#xD;
      effects. The primary risk factor for T2DM is obesity. Our randomized clinical trials&#xD;
      comparing the effects of High Protein (HP) vs High Carbohydrate (HC) weight loss diets in&#xD;
      obese, prediabetic(IGT) women and men where all foods were provided daily for 6 months(mo)&#xD;
      showed that while both diet groups had similar weight loss, 100% of HP diet subjects had&#xD;
      remission from IGT to Normal Glucose Tolerance(NGT), but only 33% of HC diet group had&#xD;
      remission. Also, the HP diet provided greater improvement in Si, CVR, IC, and an increase in&#xD;
      % lean body mass (LBM) compared to the HC diet demonstrating that weight loss is not the only&#xD;
      factor involved in remission. Based on these findings, we now propose to investigate effects&#xD;
      of HP and HC weight loss diets in Newly Diagnosed T2DM (NT2DM) women and men for 6 mo. Our&#xD;
      long term goal is to establish a weight loss diet plan for remission of NT2DM which would be&#xD;
      adaptable for use in physicians' clinics and metabolomics predictors for assess-ment of&#xD;
      remission. The overall objective of this study is to determine if remission of NT2DM can be&#xD;
      induced by dietary manipulation using a HP diet and the pathobiology of this remission. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that NT2DM subjects will have remission to NGT on the HP diet when they are&#xD;
      provided the food and daily menus for compliance. The rationale is the HP diet is palatable&#xD;
      for subjects to continue after the 6 mo study and stay in remission using diet plans we&#xD;
      provide. We will compare the effects of the HP vs HC diet on remission. Specific aims of this&#xD;
      study are to determine the effects of the HP and HC diets on NT2DM obese subjects in a 6 mo&#xD;
      feeding study and determine: (a)remission of NT2DM to NGT, (b)weight loss and LBM&#xD;
      preservation, (c)improvements in metabolic markers, CVRs, IC, epigenetic DNA methylation&#xD;
      changes and pathways involved with remission and metabolomic markers to establish predictive&#xD;
      markers of remission of NT2DM. This study is innovative in that we propose to use a&#xD;
      non-pharmaceutical means (HP diet) for remission of T2DM diabetes and weight loss and&#xD;
      determine the pathobiology involved in improvement in metabolic and CVRs by interrogating the&#xD;
      samples with emerging technologies. The proposed research is significant because if we can&#xD;
      demonstrate the HP diet cause remission of NT2DM to NGT along with other metabolic&#xD;
      improvements, it would be a significant improvement in health risk and medical cost to&#xD;
      subjects&#xD;

    <description>Remission of NT2DM to NGT will be determined by the OGTT ( a 75 gm glucose drink given at 0 minutes and then blood drawn to determine the glucose level at 2 hrs). This OGTT will be done at 3 and 6 months with the criteria of fasting glucose &lt;126 mg/l and 2 hour glucose &lt;140 mg/dl. Criteria for improvement from NT2DM to IGT will be fasting blood glucose &lt;126 mg/dl and 2 hour glucose &lt;199 mg/dl. At each weekly visit for food pick up the subject's glucose will be monitored for blood glucose changes from the start of the diet study. If subjects do not have remission of diabetes at 6 months, they will be referred to an endocrinologist for possible pharmacology treatment.</description>
