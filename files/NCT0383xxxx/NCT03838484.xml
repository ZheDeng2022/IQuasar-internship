    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether nicotine, a drug that activates receptors called&#xD;
      nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the brain, improves the ability to make or withhold&#xD;
      responses to faces that are either emotionally neutral or emotionally negative. This study&#xD;
      will also test whether the drug affects brain activity while making or withholding responses&#xD;
      using electroencephalography. Previous studies in people with schizophrenia have shown that&#xD;
      more errors in response to negative emotional cues are related to greater likelihood of&#xD;
      impulsive aggressive behavior. Therefore, the aim of this study is to determine whether&#xD;
      nicotine might be a new strategy to reduce aggressive behavior. The investigators' goal is 25&#xD;
      individuals with schizophrenia and 25 healthy controls to complete the study at Vanderbilt.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This human laboratory study seeks to test the hypothesis that activation of nicotinic&#xD;
      acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in the brain will reduce impulsive behavior in response to&#xD;
      negative emotional cues as compared to neutral emotional cues. Because impulsive action&#xD;
      during negative mood states is strongly correlated with impulsive aggression in both healthy&#xD;
      individuals and individuals with schizophrenia (discussed below), the investigators'&#xD;
      overarching, long-term goal is to determine whether nAChRs in general as well as specific&#xD;
      nAChR subclasses might represent novel treatment targets to reduce impulsive aggressive&#xD;
      behavior, a significant public health problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are a large family of excitatory, pentameric, ionotropic,&#xD;
      ligand-gated ion channels located throughout the brain and the remainder of the body. Their&#xD;
      endogenous ligand is acetylcholine, yet this family is defined by their common activation by&#xD;
      nicotine. Interestingly, anti-aggressive, or &quot;serenic&quot; effects of nicotine have been&#xD;
      demonstrated across a number of animal models, including mice, rats, and non-human primates,&#xD;
      and multiple human laboratory studies demonstrate an anti-aggressive effect of nicotine in&#xD;
      humans. The investigators' laboratory has also demonstrated that acute administration of&#xD;
      nicotine at relatively low doses results in reduction of aggressive behaviors in mouse&#xD;
      models. Because nicotine is active at all nAChRs, the investigators explored this mechanism&#xD;
      further and found that hippocampal alpha-7 nAChRs were both necessary and sufficient for&#xD;
      nicotine's serenic effect. Consistent with these findings, there is substantial evidence in&#xD;
      humans that reduction of alpha-7 nAChR signaling enhances aggressive behavior, including in&#xD;
      individuals with 15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome, a genetic disorder resulting from the&#xD;
      deletion of the region of chromosome 15 containing the gene coding for alpha-7 nAChRs. The&#xD;
      investigators have also translated these findings into human clinical populations, finding&#xD;
      recently the safety and efficacy of transdermal nicotine to reduce aggression and&#xD;
      irritability in young adults with autism spectrum disorder. This work, along with other&#xD;
      previous case studies in humans, supports targeting nAChRs using transdermal nicotine to&#xD;
      reduce aggressive behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urgency is a behavioral construct defined as the tendency to act rashly in the context of&#xD;
      strong positive or negative emotion, and explains a large degree of variance in the&#xD;
      development of impulsive aggression in subjects with schizophrenia and other populations&#xD;
      without psychiatric disorders. In patients with schizophrenia, degree of urgency correlates&#xD;
      with structural and functional changes in a neuronal network involving prefrontal cortical&#xD;
      and limbic/cognitive control brain regions. A number of previous studies have similarly&#xD;
      demonstrated impulsivity in the context of negative emotion, called &quot;negative urgency&quot;,&#xD;
      correlates with history of aggression, as well as substance use and other risky behaviors.&#xD;
      Urgency is a hereditable trait that may be considered an endophenotype of impulsive&#xD;
      aggression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies in humans have explored the relationship between mood-related impulsivity&#xD;
      (i.e. urgency) and aggressive behavior using an Emotional Go/NoGo task. This task measures&#xD;
      responding or response withholding to visual stimuli of neutral or emotional (typically&#xD;
      negative) valence, and quantifies reaction time and commission/omission errors as a function&#xD;
      of stimulus valence. Using an Emotional Go/NoGo task, Krakowski et al. studied healthy&#xD;
      controls, patients with schizophrenia with or without a history of violence, and&#xD;
      non-psychotic individuals with history of violence. In all groups, emotional valence had a&#xD;
      significant effect on error commission. In schizophrenia patients, individuals with history&#xD;
      of violence were significantly faster to make an incorrect response to negative stimuli (i.e.&#xD;
      not withhold a response) than patients without history of violence, whereas the two groups&#xD;
      did not differ in response times to neutral valence stimuli. Other studies have also&#xD;
      demonstrated an interaction between emotional valence and impulsive errors in schizophrenia,&#xD;
      as well as a relationship between emotional valence, impulsive errors, history of violence,&#xD;
      and frontal cortex 5-HT1B receptor binding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the investigators' studies in mice suggest a direct effect of nAChR stimulation on&#xD;
      aggression through activation of the alpha-7 nAChR and are supported by the results using&#xD;
      transdermal nicotine in humans, to the investigators' knowledge no previous studies have&#xD;
      directly examined the relationship between pharmacological targeting of nAChRs using&#xD;
      transdermal nicotine and effects on impulsivity in the context of emotional cues in humans.&#xD;
      The investigators now aim to directly test this hypothesis using an Emotional Go/NoGo task in&#xD;
      subjects with schizophrenia and healthy controls to determine whether transdermal nicotine&#xD;
      improves impulsive behavior and neural correlates in the context of negative and neutral&#xD;
      valence cues. Given the relationship between impulsivity and aggressive behavior, the&#xD;
      findings of this proposed study will strongly inform future studies of targeting nAChRs&#xD;
      broadly and alpha-7 nAChRs more specifically to identify novel treatments for individuals&#xD;
      with severe neuropsychiatric disorders struggling with persistent pathological impulsive&#xD;
      aggression.&#xD;
