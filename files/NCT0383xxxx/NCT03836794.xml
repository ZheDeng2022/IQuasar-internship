  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is existing evidence that rural cancer patients tend to have worse survival outcomes.&#xD;
      Potential reasons include: differences in endurance of coping with illness, different&#xD;
      attitudes about illness, the nature of rural lifestyles, and poorer access to healthcare&#xD;
      services. Some of these factors may affect their delay in presentation of cancer, and/or&#xD;
      delay in seeking treatment in a timely manner. Differences in health outcomes between urban&#xD;
      and rural populations have been described in a number of health conditions, and to date&#xD;
      survival/health outcomes related to cancer have been the most extensively researched.&#xD;
      Rurality has been associated with negative impacts on cancer outcomes in studies from the&#xD;
      United Kingdom and elsewhere. However, as with rural health disadvantage overall, the&#xD;
      underlying causes are uncertain. There is some evidence that rural populations are less&#xD;
      likely to engage with screening services and receive lower rates of chemotherapy and surgery.&#xD;
      If restricted access to services was the major determinant of poorer cancer outcomes for&#xD;
      rural populations, this should also be reflected in longer delays to diagnosis and treatment&#xD;
      for cancer for those patients living more remotely. However, a recent study from the&#xD;
      Northeast of Scotland contradicts this, finding that rural patients in Scotland were&#xD;
      diagnosed and treated for their cancers quicker than their urban counterparts, but died&#xD;
      earlier . The investigator's proposed research aims to provide insights into differences&#xD;
      between how urban and rural patients engage with health services in National Health Service&#xD;
      (NHS) Grampian by interviewing patients about their diagnostic pathway, their interactions&#xD;
      with the healthcare service, their treatment choices, and how these may have been influenced&#xD;
      by where they live.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A review of literature and data analysis within the Northeast Aberdeen Scotland Cancer and&#xD;
      Residence (NASCAR) database has established that although rural patients are diagnosed and&#xD;
      treated much more quickly than their urban counterparts, they are significantly more likely&#xD;
      to die in the first year after diagnosis. At times, it was found that patients voluntarily&#xD;
      opted out of certain recommended regimens such as radiotherapy simply due to the burden of&#xD;
      travel. Currently, literature only proposes themes such as stoicism, attitudes, the nature of&#xD;
      rural lifestyles, and access to healthcare services, but nothing is explicitly defined. Rural&#xD;
      living may influence healthcare interaction at multiple levels and the potentially complex&#xD;
      effect on cancer outcomes is best addressed through qualitative research with both urban and&#xD;
      rural patients. Qualitative enquiries are most likely to give insights into potential&#xD;
      mechanisms of urban/rural inequality within Northeast Scotland beyond.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Social Ecological Model (SEM) is a theory-based framework for understanding the&#xD;
      multifaceted and interactive effects of personal and environmental factors that determine&#xD;
      behaviours, and for identifying behavioural and organisational leverage points and&#xD;
      intermediaries for health promotion within organisations (9). This model includes several&#xD;
      nested levels; individual, interpersonal, community, organisational, and policy. When&#xD;
      addressing any health issue, it is important to assess how every level influences one&#xD;
      another. In our systematic literature review, the investigators found that the SEM provided&#xD;
      an explanatory framework through which to explore potential inequalities in urban and rural&#xD;
      cancer outcomes. Within interviews, the investigators will use the theoretical framework to&#xD;
      prompt participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1: Identifying eligible patients and recruitment Patients will be recruited from two&#xD;
      sources. First, those from rural areas and residing at the CLAN House residence Westburn&#xD;
      Road, Aberdeen during an episode of hospital-based cancer care will be approached by CLAN&#xD;
      staff on behalf of the researchers. Second, patients attending oncology clinic D at Aberdeen&#xD;
      Royal Infirmary will be approached by clinic staff on behalf of researchers. Interested&#xD;
      patients will be directed to the researcher provided the Patient Information Sheet from&#xD;
      Clan/ARI staff to obtain more information about the study and be invited to complete the&#xD;
      consent process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: Interviews with consented cancer patients. Consenting research participants will be&#xD;
      interviewed on a single occasion by Miss Carriere, using a semi-structured approach.&#xD;
      Interviews will be digitally audio recorded with permission from the participant. The&#xD;
      interview will take approximately 45 minutes. The interview will happen at a place of the&#xD;
      participant's own choosing such as within the University of Aberdeen, Clinic D - Aberdeen&#xD;
      Royal Infirmary (ARI), or CLAN locations. There will also be an option to conduct telephone&#xD;
      interviews which will last approximately 45 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3: Transcribing data from interviews and coding them appropriately Miss Carriere or NJC&#xD;
      Secretarial, who is a member of university staff in Academic Primary Care will transcribe all&#xD;
      interviews after they occur and which is an approved third party organisation for&#xD;
      transcribing such work. Miss Carriere will also utilise a 'Contact Sheet' to record&#xD;
      impressions of the participant not picked up by audio-recorded data (Miles and Huberman).&#xD;
      This will take up to 6 months to complete and analyse. Participant interviews will be&#xD;
      transcribed verbatim for analysis. Framework analysis using components of the&#xD;
      socio-ecological model, a coding framework of the main themes and sub themes will be&#xD;
      established (9). NVivo version 12 software will be used to assist with the management of the&#xD;
      data. A sample of manuscripts will be coded by a second researcher to ensure validity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 4: Disseminate information gathered from interviews Study results will be collated in&#xD;
      the form of a manuscript and further expanded in a PhD thesis. At the time of the interview,&#xD;
      participants will be asked to if they would like to receive a copy of their manuscript.&#xD;
      Before publication of the manuscript, any participants requesting to be kept informed of&#xD;
      results will be emailed a copy of the final study report or a lay summary of the results will&#xD;
      be published and available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Management Digital audio-recordings will be transcribed by Miss Carriere or transcribed&#xD;
      by NJC Secretarial and all data will be anonymised by Miss Carriere according to unique&#xD;
      participant identification codes. NJC Secretarial will receive a copy of the audio recorded&#xD;
      files with only the anonymous study ID number via secure file transfer service ZendTo hosted&#xD;
      by University of Aberdeen. NJC Secretarial will transcribe this data, sending the&#xD;
      transcription back to Romi Carriere via Zend to. Audio recordings would then be deleted by&#xD;
      NJC Secretarial. Transcripts will be imported into NVivo version 12, and each participant&#xD;
      will be assigned a Study ID that will de-identify their private information. This study ID&#xD;
      will be stored separately from the other data and will only be accessed by the research team.&#xD;
      Data will be securely stored within and excel file within a secure server and/or locked&#xD;
      cabinet in the Institute of Applied Health Sciences at the University of Aberdeen. All study&#xD;
      documentation will be kept for at least 10 years after publication of the study data in&#xD;
      accordance with the sponsors archiving Standard Operating Procedure (SOP).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients will be eligible to participate if they are adults, 18 years or over,&#xD;
             confirmed cancer diagnosis from the top eight cancer sites (lung, oesophageal,&#xD;
             colorectal, breast, pancreatic, prostate, kidney, and bladder) within the last 2&#xD;
             years. Participants can have all stages and all grades of cancer as long as they feel&#xD;
             able to provide a full interview for approximately 45 minutes. There will be an&#xD;
             opportunity for patient to opt into telephone interviews. Interviewees are able to&#xD;
             stop their interviews at any moment without having to give a reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The research team involved in recruiting will exclude patients that are unable to give&#xD;
             consent, non-English speaking patients, patients under the age of 18 and patients that&#xD;
             are too ill based on the observation of the clinical staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
        This study will exclude persons who have difficulty understanding verbal explanations in&#xD;
        English. This study is a small qualitative study based upon interviews conducted by a&#xD;
        single researcher in the English language. The analysis of the data will depend upon&#xD;
        specific words and utterances which are used by the participant. Meaning will be derived&#xD;
        from words, phrases, and utterances and will be reliant upon the participant being able to&#xD;
        communicate in the English language.&#xD;
