    <textblock>
      This phase Ib trial studies the side effects and best dose of telaglenastat hydrochloride&#xD;
      when given together with osimertinib in treating patients with stage IV non-small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer and a mutation in the EGFR gene. Telaglenastat hydrochloride and osimertinib may stop&#xD;
      the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the safety and tolerability of osimertinib (AZD9291) and CB-839 hydrochloride&#xD;
      (HCl) (telaglenastat) and determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) in patients with&#xD;
      metastatic, EGFR activating mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine toxicity profile of the combination of AZD9291 and CB-839 HCl (telaglenastat)&#xD;
      in patients with metastatic EGFR activating mutation positive NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of CB-839 HCl (telaglenastat) and AZD9291 in patients&#xD;
      with metastatic EGFR activating mutation positive NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY/CORRELATIVE OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the progression free survival (PFS) of AZD9291 and CB-839 HCl (telaglenastat)&#xD;
      in patients with EGFR mutation positive NSCLC who have developed progressive disease (PD) on&#xD;
      front-line EGFR inhibitor therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the overall survival (OS) of AZD9291 and CB-839 HCl (telaglenastat) in&#xD;
      patients with EGFR mutation positive NSCLC who have developed PD on front-line EGFR inhibitor&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess cell-free deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (cfDNA) and measure changes with&#xD;
      response to treatment as well as disease progression (EGFR sensitizing mutations, T790M&#xD;
      resistance mutation, recognized bypass mechanisms).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To assess circulating levels of glutamine, glutamate, aspartate and asparagine, and&#xD;
      measure changes with response to treatment as well as disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To assess 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) parameters&#xD;
      at baseline and after treatment to evaluate changes with response to treatment as well as&#xD;
      emergence of disease resistance or progression. (Expansion cohort, select patients only)&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To perform molecular profiling assays on malignant and normal tissues, including, but not&#xD;
      limited to, whole exome sequencing (WES) and ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing (RNAseq), in&#xD;
      order to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIa. To identify potential predictive and prognostic biomarkers beyond any genomic alteration&#xD;
      by which treatment may be assigned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIb. To identify resistance mechanisms using genomic DNA- and RNA-based assessment platforms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of telaglenastat hydrochloride followed by&#xD;
      a dose-expansion study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive telaglenastat hydrochloride orally (PO) twice daily (BID) and osimertinib PO&#xD;
      once daily (QD) (starting cycle 1 day 16 of phase I). Cycles repeat every 28 days in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.&#xD;

             inhibitor therapy with osimertinib&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have not recovered from AEs due to prior anti-cancer therapy (i.e., have&#xD;
             residual toxicities &gt; grade 1), with the exception of alopecia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous enrollment in the present study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Past medical history of interstitial lung disease, drug-induced interstitial lung&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agent within five half-lives of&#xD;
             the compound or 3 months, whichever is greater. Patients who have received prior&#xD;

             patients who have completed definitive therapy, and have had a stable neurological&#xD;
             status for at least 2 weeks after completion of definitive therapy. Patients may be on&#xD;
             corticosteroids (=&lt; 10 mg of prednisone-equivalent) to control brain metastases if&#xD;
             they have been on a stable dose for 2 weeks (14 days) prior to the start of study&#xD;
             treatment and are clinically asymptomatic&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with an uncontrolled intercurrent illness&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Currently receiving (or unable to stop use prior to receiving the first dose of study&#xD;
             treatment) medications or herbal supplements known to be potent inducers of CYP3A4&#xD;

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because CB-839 HCl (telaglenastat) is a&#xD;
             glutaminase inhibitor with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects.&#xD;
             Because there is an unknown but potential risk for AEs in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with CB-839 HCl (telaglenastat) and AZD9291, breastfeeding&#xD;
             should be discontinued if the mother is treated with CB-839 HCl (telaglenastat) and&#xD;

                  resting electrocardiogram (ECG) (e.g., complete left bundle branch block, third&#xD;
                  degree heart block, second degree heart block)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Any factors that increase the risk of QTc prolongation or risk of arrhythmic&#xD;
                  events such as heart failure, hypokalemia, congenital long QT syndrome, family&#xD;
                  history of long QT syndrome or unexplained sudden death under 40 years of age in&#xD;
                  first degree relatives, or any concomitant medication known to prolong the QT&#xD;
                  interval&#xD;

             treated malignancy at high risk of relapse during the study period with the exception&#xD;
             of localized squamous or basal cell skin cancers, ductal carcinoma in-situ (DCIS), or&#xD;
             indolent cancer currently on observation (i.e. chronic lymphocytic leukemia [CLL] or&#xD;
             low-risk prostate cancer)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic diseases, including uncontrolled&#xD;
