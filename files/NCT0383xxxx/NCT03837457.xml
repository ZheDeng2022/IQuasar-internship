  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this clinical trial is to study the efficacy and safety of cobomarsen&#xD;
      (also known as MRG-106) for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), mycosis&#xD;
      fungoides (MF) subtype in subjects who have confirmed disease progression following treatment&#xD;
      with vorinostat in the SOLAR clinical study (MRG106-11-201). Cobomarsen is designed to&#xD;
      inhibit the activity of a molecule called miR-155 that may be important to the growth and&#xD;
      survival of MF cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effects of treatment will be measured based on changes in skin lesion severity,&#xD;
      disease-associated symptoms, and quality of life, as well as the length of time that the&#xD;
      subject's disease remains stable or improved, without evidence of disease progression. The&#xD;
      safety and tolerability of cobomarsen will be assessed based on the frequency and severity of&#xD;
      observed side effects.&#xD;

      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 60 subjects are expected to be enrolled after discontinuation from the SOLAR clinical&#xD;
      study (MRG106-11-201). Cobomarsen will be administered in the clinic by 2-hr intravenous&#xD;
      infusion on Days 1, 3, 5 and 8, and weekly thereafter. Treatment will continue until the&#xD;
      subject becomes intolerant, develops clinically significant side effects, progresses, or the&#xD;
      trial is terminated.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </detailed_description>
  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Study no longer needed because eligible subjects may receive treatment with cobomarsen in a&#xD;
    crossover arm of the SOLAR clinical trial (NCT03713320)&#xD;
