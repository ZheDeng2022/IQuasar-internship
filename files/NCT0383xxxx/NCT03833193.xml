      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the incidences of Grade III and above&#xD;
      radiation-reduced esophagitis and radiation-reduced pneumonia of patients with advanced lung&#xD;
      cancer treated with moderate hypofractionated (3Gy/f) radiotherapy, and their predictors.&#xD;
      Efficacies are also evaluated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Radiotherapy plays an irreplaceable role in lung cancer. However, due to the long duration of&#xD;
      conventional fractionation irradiation, tumor cells will accelerate repopulation after 3 to 4&#xD;
      weeks during radiotherapy, resulting in decreased efficacy. Hypofractionated radiation is&#xD;
      increasingly used in radiotherapy of lung cancer. It can shorten the overall treatment time,&#xD;
      and can potentially reduce the effect of tumor accelerated repopulation. Compared with&#xD;
      conventional radiotherapy, hypofractionated radiotherapy can theoretically obtain a higher&#xD;
      biological effective dose (BED). The application of Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy&#xD;
      (SBRT) or Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy (SABR) in advanced or central lung cancer is&#xD;
      restricted when the tumors are adjacent to important organs. Moderate hypofractionated&#xD;
      radiotherapy can not only shorten the overall total treatment time, but also reduce the&#xD;
      severe toxicities. It is widely used in lung cancer nowadays. However, most data of the&#xD;
      tolerated doses for normal tissue and organs comes from conventional radiotherapy. Whether or&#xD;
      not it is suitable for hypofractionated radiotherapy has not been determined. In our study,&#xD;
      the incidences of Grade III and above radiation-reduced esophagitis and radiation-reduced&#xD;
      pneumonia, as well as their predictors, were obtained by retrospective analysis of patients&#xD;
      received moderate hypofractionated radiotherapy of 3Gy/f. At the same time, the efficacies of&#xD;
      this scheme are also evaluated.&#xD;
