  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to develop an open-source, publicly available machine learning&#xD;
      model that health systems could download and apply to their electronic health record data&#xD;
      marts to screen for substance misuse in their patients. The investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      the natural language processing algorithm can provide a standardized and interoperable&#xD;
      approach for an automated daily screen on all hospitalized patients and provide better&#xD;
      implementation fidelity for screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 2016, nearly 30% hospital discharges in the United States (US) had a major diagnostic&#xD;
      category for a substance-use related condition. Substance misuse ranks second among principal&#xD;
      diagnoses for unplanned 7-day hospital readmission rates. Despite the availability of&#xD;
      Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) interventions, substance&#xD;
      misuse is not part of the admission routine and only a minority of patients are screened for&#xD;
      substance misuse in the hospital setting. This is particularly problematic, since among&#xD;
      hospitalized inpatients, the prevalence of substance misuse is estimated to be as high as&#xD;
      25%, greater than either the general population or outpatient setting. Practical screening&#xD;
      methods tailored for the hospital setting are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the advent of Meaningful Use in the electronic health record (EHR), efficiency for alcohol&#xD;
      detection may be improved by leveraging data collected during usual care. Documentation of&#xD;
      substance use is common and occurs in over 96% of provider admission notes, but their free&#xD;
      text format renders them difficult to mine and analyze. Natural Language Processing (NLP) and&#xD;
      machine learning are subfields of artificial intelligence (AI) that provide a solution to&#xD;
      analyze text data in the EHR to identify substance misuse. Modern NLP has fused with machine&#xD;
      learning, another sub-field of artificial intelligence focused on learning from data. In&#xD;
      particular, the most powerful NLP methods rely on supervised learning, a type of machine&#xD;
      learning that takes advantage of current reference standards to make predictions about unseen&#xD;
      cases&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the earlier version of an NLP and machine learning tool, the investigators successfully&#xD;
      used data from clinical notes collected in the first 24 hours of hospital admission to reach&#xD;
      a sensitivity and specificity above 70% for identifying alcohol misuse. With nearly 36&#xD;
      million hospital admissions in 2016, a substance misuse classifier has potential to impact&#xD;
      millions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the aim is to prospectively implement a substance misuse classifier to examine&#xD;
      its effectiveness against current practice of all hospitalized adult patients at a tertiary&#xD;
      health system. The health system has a mature screening system to examine substance misuse&#xD;
      classifier performance against current practice of questionnaire screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that the substance misuse classifier may provide a standardized,&#xD;
      interoperable, and accurate approach to screen hospitalized patients. Successful&#xD;
      implementation of the classifier in hospitalized patients is a step towards an automated and&#xD;
      comprehensive universal screening system for substance misuse.&#xD;
