  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is mainly considered a nutrition-related disease and&#xD;
      life-style/diet interventions showed some promising results. But in spite of this, there are&#xD;
      no available markers to efficiently guide interventions. the hypothesize put farth by the&#xD;
      investigators is that NAFLD patients develop postprandial abnormalities of plasma lipids upon&#xD;
      &quot;western diet&quot; challenge, more severe in steatohepatitis (NASH) than in pure steatosis&#xD;
      (NAFL), promoting liver injury. Our study aims to evaluate the presence of toxic lipids (such&#xD;
      as free-fatty acids, ceramides, diacylglycerols, sphingolipids) in postprandial state after&#xD;
      ingestion of a &quot;western diet&quot; in NAFLD patients. Consecutive patients (group 1: NAFL&#xD;
      patients; group 2: NASH patients) with biopsy-proven NAFLD (liver biopsy &lt; 6 months) will be&#xD;
      recruited during a period of 12 month. Blood samples will be drawn at fasting, 2hours,&#xD;
      4hours, 6hours and 8hours after ingestion of a &quot;western diet&quot; meal. Plasma lipid profiles&#xD;
      using lipidomics, circulating markers of liver injury and inflammation will be analyzed. the&#xD;
      investigators will also assess the hepatotoxicity of plasma from NAFL or NASH patients&#xD;
      in-vitro.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Factors driving progression from steatosis (NAFL) to steatohepatitis (NASH) in patients with&#xD;
      non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) remain largely unknown. Considerable data now&#xD;
      indicate that steatosis per se is not a hepatotoxic event and may represent in fact a&#xD;
      protective mechanism against free fatty acid (FFA)-induced toxicity. the investigators&#xD;
      previously showed that Kupffer cells from NASH mice accumulate more toxic lipids (ceramides,&#xD;
      diacylglycerols, sphingolipids) enhancing their proinflammatory polarization. Therefore,&#xD;
      &quot;quality&quot; of accumulating lipids rather than &quot;quantity&quot; may play a central role in NAFLD&#xD;
      progression. This is a pilot comparative study aiming to evaluate the presence of toxic&#xD;
      lipids (such as free-fatty acids, ceramides, diacylglycerols, sphingolipids) in postprandial&#xD;
      state after ingestion of a &quot;western diet&quot; in NAFL and NASH patients. The secondary outcomes&#xD;
      were: to evaluate the relationship between postprandial circulating lipids and markers of&#xD;
      liver injury and proinflammatory cytokines; to evaluate hepatotoxicity of postprandial lipids&#xD;
      in vitro. A total of 24 consecutive patients (group 1: 12 NAFL patients; group 2: 12 NASH&#xD;
      patients) with biopsy-proven NAFLD (liver biopsy &lt; 6 months) will be recruited. A dietary&#xD;
      evaluation covering the 2 previous weeks will be performed. Detailed anthropometric data will&#xD;
      be collected (body mass index, waist and hip circumferences, abdominal height, cutaneous&#xD;
      skinfolds) and serum metabolic parameters (standard lipid profile, lipoprotein levels,&#xD;
      fasting plasma glucose, insulin levels, C-peptide levels, hemoglobin A1c) will be evaluated.&#xD;
      After a 12hours overnight fast, patients will undergo an oral &quot;western diet&quot; test consisting&#xD;
      in the ingestion of a high saturated fat, high refined sugar, high fructose-meal called&#xD;
      &quot;western diet&quot; (800 kcal/meal). Blood samples will be drawn at fasting and then 2, 4, 6 and&#xD;
      8hours after ingestion of the standard meal. Each time plasma and serum samples will be&#xD;
      stored at -80°C for subsequent analysis. Lipidomics will be used to quantify each plasma&#xD;
      lipid class (neutral lipids, phospholipids and fatty acid methyl esters). Serum levels of&#xD;
      cytokines will be assessed using multiple assay technology. Markers of liver injury will be&#xD;
      assessed (aminotransferases, Keratin 18 fragments, microRNA-122) in the serum. Hepatocytes&#xD;
      will be cultured with plasma from NAFL or NASH patients, and incubated overnight. In vitro&#xD;
      hepatotoxicity will be evaluated using TUNEL assay, MTT assay and LDH release assay. the&#xD;
      investigators anticipate that inflammation together with hepatocyte death will occur in NAFLD&#xD;
      patients who develop specific postprandial plasma lipid changes with an increase in toxic&#xD;
      lipid levels. Such patients may develop more severe liver lesions (inflammation,&#xD;
      fibrosis/cirrhosis) and benefit of interventions. Identification of a toxic plasma lipid&#xD;
      profile may help choosing the adequate diet in order to prevent deleterious lipid formation.&#xD;
      Identification of a toxic postprandial plasma lipid signature specific to hepatotoxicity may&#xD;
      also serve to develop a discrimination index to be further validated in clinical practice.&#xD;
