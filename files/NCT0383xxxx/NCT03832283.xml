  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, very little research exists on whether patient portals could be used to integrate&#xD;
      patient-reported outcome (PRO) measurement into the electronic health record (EHR) and&#xD;
      clinical practice, even though 87% of ambulatory care practices have EHRs and 88% of U.S.&#xD;
      adults have access to the internet. To date, no randomized controlled trial has examined&#xD;
      whether patient portals can be used to collect PRO measures. The goal of this study is to&#xD;
      implement the integration of a computerized adaptive test (CAT) for patient-reported outcome&#xD;
      (PRO) measurement of depression symptoms into an electronic health record (EHR) and evaluate&#xD;
      the effectiveness of collecting CAT PROs via an EHR patient portal in two randomized&#xD;
      controlled trials. This study will advance the science of implementation of patient-centered&#xD;
      outcomes research into clinical practice, as well as the evidence for high quality,&#xD;
      accessible care.&#xD;

      The overall goal of this proposal is to implement the integration of the Computerized&#xD;
      Adaptive Test for Mental Health (CAT-MH) into an EHR for a healthcare system and evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of collecting CAT-MH PROs via an EHR-tethered patient portal (MyChart) vs.&#xD;
      usual care in two randomized controlled trials. The first aim of this study will consist of a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial comparing screening rates among adult primary care patients with&#xD;
      an active patient portal account (MyChart) and due for depression screening who receive usual&#xD;
      care (CAT-MH screenings during routine clinic visits) vs. MyChart population-based CAT-MH&#xD;
      screenings. The second aim of this study involves a randomized controlled trial comparing&#xD;
      depression remission rates among patients with active moderate-to-severe MDD who receive&#xD;
      usual care vs. MyChart CAT-MH measurement-based care. In addition, we will examine the&#xD;
      resources needed to integrate the CAT-MH into the EHR and design the health IT strategy for&#xD;
      collecting PROs via the patient portal.&#xD;

    <description>Patients randomized to this intervention arm will receive usual care annual depression screening when they come in for a clinic visit and are due for screening. When the patient comes in for a visit, a best practice alert in the EHR will indicate that the patient requires depression screening. The CAD-MDD/CAT-DI screening during clinic visit will occur in a patient room, prior to their appointment with a primary care provider.</description>

    <description>Patients will receive invitations via MyChart to complete the CAD-MDD to screen for major depressive disorder (MDD). For patients who screen positive for MDD, CAT-DI will launch automatically and assess depression severity. CAT-DI assigns a score of 0 to 100 in four severity categories (&lt;50=normal, 50 to 65=mild, 66 to 75=moderate, and &gt;75=severe).</description>
