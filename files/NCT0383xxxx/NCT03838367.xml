    <textblock>
      This is a phase Ib/II Study of Leronlimab (PRO 140) combined with Carboplatin in Patients&#xD;
      with CCR5+ Metastatic Triple Negative Breast Cancer (mTNBC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population will consist of patients with CCR5-positive, locally advanced or metastatic&#xD;
      triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC) who are naïve to chemotherapy in metastatic setting but&#xD;
      have been exposed to anthracyclines and taxane in neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings&#xD;
      (first-line).&#xD;
    </textblock>

      Phase Ib&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase Ib is a dose escalation phase with 3 dose levels (cohorts) of leronlimab (PRO 140)&#xD;
      administered in combination with a fixed dose of carboplatin at AUC 5. This dose finding&#xD;
      portion of study will follow a &quot;3+3&quot; designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)&#xD;
      of leronlimab (PRO 140) administered as subcutaneous injection in subjects with&#xD;
      histologically confirmed mTNBC that express CCR5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II is a single arm study with 30 patients in order to test the hypothesis that the&#xD;
      combination of carboplatin AUC 5 intravenously and MTD of leronlimab (PRO 140) SC will&#xD;
      increase PFS in patients with CCR5 + mTNBC.&#xD;
