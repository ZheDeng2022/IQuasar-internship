  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Context and justification: Vertigo leads to medical consultation, interruption of daily&#xD;
      activities or work stoppage in 80% of cases. Optokinetic stimulation is used in awareness and&#xD;
      adaptation exercises. The technology of three-dimensional head-mounted provides a strong&#xD;
      immersion allowing optokinetic stimulation but studies interested in virtual reality in the&#xD;
      context of balance rehabilitation have not been able to highlight the superiority of this&#xD;
      therapy. The investigators therefore propose a non-inferiority trial because of the&#xD;
      affordable price and small size of three-dimensional head-mounted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives : The objective of this study is to evaluate whether a rehabilitation program&#xD;
      using virtual reality is as effective as a reference program using Smart Equitest and an&#xD;
      optokinetic stimulator to improve the balance of patients with vestibular syndrome after 3 or&#xD;
      4 weeks of rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators also assess the disability related to vertigo and balance disorders as well&#xD;
      as the tolerance of virtual reality Methodology: Prospective, randomized controlled&#xD;
      non-inferiority trial, monocentric, 2 parallel arm, with blind assessed after 3 or 4 weeks of&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion criteria are the pathologies eligible for a vestibular rehabilitation program&#xD;
      and the possible standing position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The criteria for non-inclusion are visually impaired or blind subjects, lack of relief&#xD;
      vision, history of epilepsy, significant strabismus, permanent bilateral vestibular areflexes&#xD;
      and Ménière's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main evaluation criterion is the balance score obtained with eyes closed on an unstable&#xD;
      plane during a sensory organization test performed on a dynamic posturology platform,&#xD;
      obtained during the final evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary judgment criteria are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The balance scores obtained in the sensory organization test under other conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Dizziness Handicap Inventory obtained during the final evaluation and three months&#xD;
           after the end of the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The tolerance of virtual reality will be measured weekly by the Simulator Sickness&#xD;
           Questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics: The number of subjects to be included is 76, the analysis will first be performed&#xD;
      per-protocol, the difference in scores between the two groups will be calculated, as well as&#xD;
      its 95% confidence interval. If the lower bound of this interval is above the non-inferiority&#xD;
      threshold, the same analysis will be performed on the population intending to treat (all&#xD;
      randomized patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Process: Recruitment and rehabilitation take place at the CH Coste Floret. The duration of&#xD;
      inclusions is 27 months, The duration of patient participation in the protocol is 4 months.&#xD;
      Patients are cared for 21 or 28 days with two sessions of physiotherapy per day, five days a&#xD;
      week, then resolved by telephone 3 months after the rehabilitation Feasibility: CH Coste&#xD;
      Floret has the human and material resources necessary to carry out the protocol. The PMSI&#xD;
      data show that the department receives about 40 patients per year who are likely to&#xD;
      participate in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes / perspectives: In the event of a result validating the non-inferiority of virtual&#xD;
      reality, this study could provide further evidence of the value of this type of tool for the&#xD;
      rehabilitation of subjects suffering from vestibular disorders. In addition, a&#xD;
      medico-economic study would be possible in order to reinforce the advantages of virtual&#xD;
      reality helmets.&#xD;
