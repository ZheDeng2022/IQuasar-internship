  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preterm birth is a serious public health issue, affecting 10% of all births in the US alone.&#xD;
      Three quarters of these infants are born between 34 0/7 and 36 6‚ÅÑ7 weeks' gestation or&#xD;
      late-preterm (LP). Mothers of LP infants are at increased risk for postpartum stress,&#xD;
      depression and mother-infant interaction problems posing significant risks for infant&#xD;
      development. Our proposed project will advance the fields of maternal and child health by&#xD;
      examining the impact of the Newborn Behavioral Observations Family Wellness (NBO-FW), a&#xD;
      dyadic, two generational intervention targeting maternal wellbeing and early mother-infant&#xD;
      relations in families of LP born infants. The NBO-FW is a 12week preventative intervention&#xD;
      aimed at promoting maternal mental health and positive parenting. It is based on the highly&#xD;
      successful NBO intervention developed by our team and applied across five continents, but&#xD;
      with important new elements targeting maternal mental health and the needs of high-risk LP&#xD;
      infants and their families. Participants will consist of 200 first-time mothers and their LP&#xD;
      infants (100 intervention and 100 control dyads) born at Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH),&#xD;
      an urban teaching hospital of Harvard Medical School and the largest maternity care provider&#xD;
      in Boston. Data will be collected at three time points: during the birth hospitalization, at&#xD;
      a follow-up visit at 4-6 weeks corrected gestational age, and at a further visit 10-12 weeks&#xD;
      after birth. Outcomes will include standardized measures of maternal stress, depression,&#xD;
      parenting confidence, and observed mother-infant interaction. Information about infant health&#xD;
      care practices and maternal/infant health will also be recorded. We hypothesize that,&#xD;
      compared to mothers in the care as usual control group, first-time mothers of LP infants who&#xD;
      receive the NBO-FW will demonstrate a) lower levels of stress and depression, b) greater&#xD;
      parenting confidence, c) higher quality interactions with their infants (e.g., positive&#xD;
      affect, sensitivity, responsiveness, emotional connection); and (d) engage in more optimal&#xD;
      infant health care practices.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preterm birth is a serious public health issue, affecting 10% of births in the US alone. The&#xD;
      vast majority of these infants are born between 32 and 37 weeks of gestation and are at&#xD;
      increased risk of neurodevelopmental problems. The mothers of these infants are also at&#xD;
      increased risk for postpartum stress, depression and mother-infant interaction problems which&#xD;
      can further exacerbate child risks. Specific maternal and family challenges include&#xD;
      mother-infant emotional disconnection, less sensitive maternal care behavior, and reduced&#xD;
      engagement in healthy infant care practices such as breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, relatively little attention has been given to addressing the needs of preterm born&#xD;
      (&gt;32 and &lt;37 weeks of gestation) infants and their families, with most research focusing on&#xD;
      the very and extremely preterm born infant. As a result, there are few to no interventions&#xD;
      that specifically: a) address the needs of the preterm infant and their caregivers; b) offer&#xD;
      parent education; c) foster a close mother-infant relationship; and d) seek to provide&#xD;
      support and empowerment of mothers. This stands in contrast to an extensive body of&#xD;
      experimental and human infant research showing that early mother-infant contact is essential&#xD;
      for both maternal wellbeing and offspring development, with disruptions to this early&#xD;
      relationship having lifelong negative effects for the infant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research project meets this important gap, with the goal of advancing the fields of&#xD;
      maternal and child health by examining the impact of a dyadic two-generation, Newborn&#xD;
      Behavioral Observations-Family Wellness (NBO-FW) intervention on early maternal wellbeing and&#xD;
      mother-infant relations in families of preterm born infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is now good evidence to support the importance of early intervention as a preventative&#xD;
      strategy to reduce the risks of longer term development problems in both typically developing&#xD;
      and high-risk populations of mothers and infants. Intervening early with young children who&#xD;
      are at risk for developmental delay has been shown to positively impact children's&#xD;
      developmental outcomes across multiple functional domains, spanning health, language,&#xD;
      cognitive and social-emotional development. In addition, families benefit from early&#xD;
      intervention because it can increase their ability to understand and meet their child's&#xD;
      needs, as well as mitigate stressors that may be adversely impacting maternal wellbeing, the&#xD;
      mother-infant relationship and in turn, healthy child development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Original Newborn Behavioral Observation Intervention The original NBO developed here in&#xD;
      Boston by Kevin Nugent and colleagues is an interactive observational tool used by clinicians&#xD;
      to strengthen the relationship between parents and infants from birth to age 3 months, or&#xD;
      even longer in the case of the at-risk infant. As such, it is a flexible, short-term,&#xD;
      family-centered early intervention strategy that is suitable for use and widely used in&#xD;
      newborn units, the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), obstetric, pediatric, and other&#xD;
      primary care settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During an NBO session, a certified clinician and parent observe the newborn together for&#xD;
      about 15-20 minutes. The focus is on 18 neurobehavioral items designed to capture the&#xD;
      infant's visual, auditory, and perceptual abilities used by the infant to explore their world&#xD;
      and engage in mutually responsive face-to-face interaction. These items include observations&#xD;
      of the infant's capacity to habituate to external light and sound stimuli (sleep protection);&#xD;
      the quality of motor tone and activity level; the capacity for self-regulation (including&#xD;
      crying and consolability); response to stress (indices of the infant's threshold for&#xD;
      stimulation such as color change, startles and tremors); and the infant's visual, auditory,&#xD;
      and social-interactive capacities (degree of alertness and response to both human and&#xD;
      non-human stimuli). The original NBO is now used widely as a clinical tool throughout Europe,&#xD;
      Australasia, Asia, Africa, and North America.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Existing data from evaluations of the NBO dyadic intervention demonstrate positive impacts on&#xD;
      both maternal postpartum depression risk and the quality of mother-child interactions in&#xD;
      depressed mothers and preterm infants hospitalized in the NICU. Although it's effectiveness&#xD;
      with first-time mothers and their late preterm infants has not been evaluated, there is some&#xD;
      support for its utility. Specifically, Nugent and Bartlett have conducted a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial (RCT) with first-time mothers and their full-term born infants (n = 106) in&#xD;
      hospital and home settings. They found that the NBO was associated with a 75% reduction in&#xD;
      maternal symptoms of depression one month after birth. A second smaller RCT study by the same&#xD;
      authors (n = 35) with mothers and their full-term infants, also showed that mothers who&#xD;
      received an NBO intervention were 2.5 times more likely to be rated as sensitive caregivers&#xD;
      than non-intervention control mothers. Their infants were also observed, in turn, to be 2.8&#xD;
      times more responsive to their mothers, suggesting a stronger mother-infant connection.&#xD;
      Finally, the NBO has been linked with increased maternal parenting confidence, enhanced&#xD;
      interactions between mothers and their high-risk newborns, and increased parental knowledge&#xD;
      of infant behaviors and competencies across a range of high risk populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our Enhanced Newborn Behavioral Observation - Family Wellness (NBO-FW) Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In collaboration with Nugent and Bartlett, we have developed an extended NBO intervention.&#xD;
      This new intervention termed the Newborn Behavioral Observation - Family Wellness (NBO-FW)&#xD;
      approach builds on the strengths of the NBO but includes additional resources and strategies&#xD;
      to promote parental wellbeing and mental health, as well as greater parental self-reflection&#xD;
      on their infant and themselves as parents aimed at helping new mothers of a preterm born&#xD;
      infant bond with their baby, feel better about themselves, and to be a more confident and&#xD;
      competent parent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This new NBO-FW approach is a 12-week preventative intervention that will consist of 1-2&#xD;
      in-person NBO-FW session in the hospital followed by a tele-health follow-up visit and a&#xD;
      third outpatient in-person NBO-FW session with a trained and NBO certified therapist. These&#xD;
      visits will be supplemented by the use of a parental self-reflection guide between sessions&#xD;
      to maintain maternal engagement in the intervention and to further foster the dyads progress&#xD;
      in understanding each other. All therapy sessions will be completed by an appropriately&#xD;
      qualified mental health/early intervention professional trained and supervised by Kevin&#xD;
      Nugent and Lise Johnson.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Against this background, the overall objective of this research project is to examine whether&#xD;
      the Newborn Behavioral Observations-Family Wellness (NBO-FW) intervention leads to better&#xD;
      maternal mental health, healthier mother-infant interactions, parenting confidence, and&#xD;
      better infant health care practices in new mothers giving birth to a preterm born infant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed project aims to advance understanding of how to intervene successfully to&#xD;
      improve postpartum maternal mental health, parent-child relations, and mothers' infant health&#xD;
      care practices in high risk families. The strategy, methodology, and data analyses used to&#xD;
      accomplish these aims are based on evidence generated from the first RCT studies conducted by&#xD;
      Drs. Nugent, Bartlett, and colleagues. As such, the NBO-FW intervention has the potential to&#xD;
      fulfill an important unmet need in supporting parents and their high-risk newborns in the&#xD;
      early days and weeks of life. Potential benefits to patients will include additional&#xD;
      assessments of their infant's health and wellbeing, as well as additional individualized&#xD;
      support in hospital and during their transition to home. More broadly, study findings will&#xD;
      advance knowledge about how best to improve outcomes for future preterm infants and families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are multiple strengths and unique qualities of the NBO-FW intervention that support its&#xD;
      chances of research and clinical success. These include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Positive adaptive model. Rather than being based on a deficit model of illness, the&#xD;
           NBO-FW is based on a positive adaptive developmental model that has been shown across a&#xD;
           number of studies to help mothers learn to understand and care for their newborns.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Critical time of opportunity. The birth of a child is one of the most important&#xD;
           normative crises of life. New mothers may be uniquely open to change and support in the&#xD;
           first days and weeks in ways that do not necessarily persist once the adjustments -&#xD;
           positive or negative - to life with their new baby have been made and caregiving&#xD;
           patterns are established. Appropriate for use within the first days following birth, the&#xD;
           NBO-FW leverages this opportunity to its greatest potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Efficient, short term intervention timed to coincide with routine medical care. The&#xD;
           NBO-FW intervention is an efficient, cost-effective tool for addressing the common&#xD;
           condition of postpartum stress and depression, as well as fostering positive parenting&#xD;
           and infant health care practices. The NBO-FW intervention can be completed with a&#xD;
           limited number of encounters over the first 4-6 weeks of life and is designed so that it&#xD;
           can be implemented in tandem alongside routine clinical care.&#xD;
