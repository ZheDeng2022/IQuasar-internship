      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -A gene provides instructions to the body. Mutated genes can sometimes cause cancer. Germline&#xD;
      mutations are those people are born with. These mutations in the BAP1 gene can cause&#xD;
      mesothelioma and other cancers. Researchers want to study people with germline mutations of&#xD;
      BAP1 and other genes known to cause cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To learn how cancer might develop in people with certain gene mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -People ages 2 and older with a germline mutation in BAP1 or another gene that might cause&#xD;
      cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Medical and family history&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Saliva test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants with mesothelioma will be in the NIH Group. Participants without&#xD;
           mesothelioma can choose to be in either the NIH Group or the Remote Group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Remote Group participants will have a medical and family history by phone. If they have&#xD;
           tumor tissue from a previous surgery, it will be tested. They will be contacted once a&#xD;
           year by phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  NIH Group participants will have a baseline visit. This can take up to 4 days. They may&#xD;
           have to stay in the area overnight. The visit will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Evaluation of tumor tissue if available&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Optional tumor biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Blood tests&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Scans: A machine will take pictures of the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Photographs of skin lesions or other issues&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Skin exam&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Eye exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  NIH Group participants will have visits once or twice a year. These will include a&#xD;
           physical exam, lab tests, scans, and other tests as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants who have a confirmed mutation will be asked to contact any relatives who&#xD;
           may be at risk and ask them about joining the study.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BRCA1-Associated Protein-1 (BAP1), a deubiquitinase involved in regulating DNA repair&#xD;
           enzymes, is believed to be a prominent mutation in malignant mesothelioma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Germline mutations involving BAP1 have been reported in familial studies. These have&#xD;
           been associated with a higher likelihood of mesothelioma as well as several other&#xD;
           malignancies, including uveal melanoma, cutaneous melanomas, renal cell carcinoma and&#xD;
           cholangiocarcinoma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BAP1 mutations, if found, have a high probability of detecting multiple malignancies in&#xD;
           family members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To characterize the natural and clinical history of malignant mesothelioma patients and&#xD;
      their family members who have germline mutations in BAP1 and other DNA repair/cancer&#xD;
      predisposition genes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility for Genetic Testing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Individual with mesothelioma with deleterious germline mutations in BAP1 or another&#xD;
      DNA-repair/cancer predisposition gene(s) (previous testing may have been research or&#xD;
      clinical)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individual with a diagnosis of mesothelioma who is otherwise eligible for testing on&#xD;
           Cohort 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age greater than or equal to 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Individual with a germline BAP1 mutation who does not have a history of mesothelioma&#xD;
      (previous testing may have been research or clinical)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OR&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Individual with no personal history of mesothelioma with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      --a first degree biological relative (living or deceased) with a history of mesothelioma&#xD;
&#xD;
      OR&#xD;
&#xD;
      --a first degree biological relative with a CLIA confirmed germline mutation in BAP1&#xD;
&#xD;
      OR&#xD;
&#xD;
      --a first degree biological relative with mesothelioma and a CLIA confirmed germline mutation&#xD;
      in another DNA-repair/cancer predisposition genes&#xD;
&#xD;
      OR&#xD;
&#xD;
      --a second degree biological relative with mesothelioma and a CLIA confirmed germline&#xD;
      mutation in BAP1&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Age greater than or equal to 16 unless participant has a BAP1 mutation or a first degree&#xD;
      biological relative with a confirmed TP53 or BAP1 germline mutation; in such cases, will&#xD;
      begin screening at age greater than or equal to 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility for Surveillance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      -No additional criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Testing performed on study must confirm presence of germline mutation in BAP1 or another DNA&#xD;
      repair/cancer predisposition gene(s)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals with suspected hereditary predisposition to mesothelioma and their families&#xD;
           will be recruited to assess for genetic mutations, and to study the natural history of&#xD;
           malignancies occurring in germline BAP1 mutations as well as other mutations involved in&#xD;
           DNA repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening examinations will be offered to those with germline BAP1 mutations as well as&#xD;
           other mutations involved in DNA repair/cancer predisposition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We will determine if there is a relationship between germline mutation and disease&#xD;
           phenotype.&#xD;
