  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Molecular diagnosis of idiopathic interstitial pneumonias is an innovative way to potentially&#xD;
      improve the diagnostic accuracy of surgical lung biopsies (SLBs), introducing molecular&#xD;
      classifiers of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) vs. non-specific interstitial pneumonia&#xD;
      (NSIP), the 2 main types of idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIPs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that pre-defined gene expression profiles previously identified&#xD;
      on large lung explants can still be identified and reproducible on smaller, clinically&#xD;
      available surgical lung biopsies (SLBs), and can be used to increase diagnostic accuracy&#xD;
      during multi-disciplinary discussion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators also hypothesize that the expression level of individual, preselected genes&#xD;
      that accurately differentiate IPF from NSIP on lung explants can be reproduced on SLBs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will isolate RNA from SLBs obtained from patients with IIP and perform&#xD;
      microarray analysis to verify the reproducibility of gene expression profiles on SLBs.&#xD;
      Individual genes expression levels will be determined by RT-PCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis will be determined by MDD and further validated by prospective follow-up of&#xD;
      patients for a period of 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will assess the impact of molecular diagnostic techniques on interobserver&#xD;
      agreement during multi-disciplinary discussion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will prospectively follow the clinical course of patients after SLB for a&#xD;
      period of 3 years to validate the diagnosis, and asses the diagnostic accuracy of molecular&#xD;
      techniques.&#xD;

      Aim of the study This is a prospective, observational trial to collect samples of SLB,&#xD;
      extract RNA, analyze transcriptional profiles by microarray, and validate previously&#xD;
      identified gene expression profiles and individual genes expression levels against the&#xD;
      diagnosis of IIP (IPF vs. NSIP), defined by multi-disciplinary discussion, and further&#xD;
      confirmed by subsequent clinical course. There is no experimental drug involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Test and validate the reproducibility of gene expression profiles of IPF and NSIP on the&#xD;
           transcriptome obtained from surgical lung biopsies (lung homogenates), prospectively&#xD;
           collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Test the gene expression profiles of IPF and NSIP, respectively, as predictors of 3-year&#xD;
           survival from the time of biopsy. .&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Test individual gene expression levels (markers of NSIP or IPF) in lung homogenates from&#xD;
           SLB with real-time RT-PCR, as discriminators of IPF vs. NSIP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the diagnosis of IPF or NSIP will be established by multi-disciplinary discussion,&#xD;
      as per guidelines, in order to further validate gene signatures and singles genes as reliable&#xD;
      discriminators of IPF vs. NSIP, we will prospectively follow the clinical course of patients&#xD;
      for a period of 3 years, to make sure that the clinical course is consistent with either IPF&#xD;
      (worse) or NSIP (better). The average clinical courses of IPF and NSIP are clearly&#xD;
      established by our 6-year interstitial lung disease database experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of expected outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Definition of a diagnosis of IPF vs. NSIP by MDD among Respirologist, Chest Radiologist&#xD;
           and Lung Pathologist, as per current clinical practice. Kappa statistics will be also&#xD;
           used to evaluate the diagnostic impact of molecular diagnostic techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Comprehensive microarray analysis of all SLB, including significance analysis of&#xD;
           microarray, principal component analysis, hierarchical clustering and Ingenuity pathway&#xD;
           analysis. The reproducibility of predefined gene expression profiles of IPF and NSIP&#xD;
           will be studied on surgical lung biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Real time RT-PCR to measure the gene expression levels of 6 selected genes that may&#xD;
           differentiate IPF from NSIP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Prospective follow-up of clinical course (3 years) to further validate diagnostic&#xD;
           accuracy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Study of the predictive power of gene expression profiles of IPF and NSIP (categorical&#xD;
           variables) and of the expression level of 6 selected genes (continuous variables)&#xD;
           towards 3-year survival from the time of biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Assessment of diagnostic accuracy area under the curve, sensitivity, specificity) of&#xD;
           molecular techniques, after validation of diagnosis with 3-year post-biopsy clinical&#xD;
           course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects After ruling out known causes (rheumatoid disorders, occupational, environmental or&#xD;
      domestic exposures, drugs) of pulmonary fibrosis, patients being referred for a SLB to&#xD;
      clarify the diagnosis of IIP (IPF vs. NSIP) will be recruited in the study. Informed, written&#xD;
      consent will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic characteristics and pulmonary function tests prior to the SLB will be recorded.&#xD;
      The pre-SLB high resolution chest CT scan will be considered together with the SLB during&#xD;
      MDD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Storage and processing of samples At the time of SLB, an adequate sample of each SLB will be&#xD;
      snap frozen with liquid nitrogen and stored at -80ÂºC, until RNA extraction is carried on.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RNA extraction and Microarray analysis RNA will be isolated, labeled, and hybridized to the&#xD;
      human gene 1.0 set array by the London Regional Genomic Centre according to the&#xD;
      manufacturer's protocols (Illumina EpiCentre ScriptSeq).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data sets for microarray experiments will be made available at the Gene Expression Omnibus&#xD;
      repository.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Partek software (St.Louis, MO) will be used for the preliminary analysis. Probe-level data&#xD;
      will be pre-processed. This will include robust multi-array average background correction and&#xD;
      data normalization, which will be performed across all arrays using quantile normalization.&#xD;
      Background-adjusted, normalized values will then be compiled, or summarized, using the median&#xD;
      polish technique, to generate a single measure of expression. As an exploratory data&#xD;
      analysis, principal component analysis mapping and F Ratio analysis (signal-to-noise ratio)&#xD;
      will also be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Significant Analysis of Microarray, 33,297 probe sets will be used. The q value will be&#xD;
      adopted as a multiple comparison correction and used to identify differentially expressed&#xD;
      genes. The q value represents the minimal false discovery ratio (FDR) at which an individual&#xD;
      hypothesis test may be called significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For hierarchical clustering, Cluster 3.0 and Treeview (Eisen's laboratory, Standford Univ.)&#xD;
      will be used. Unsupervised clustering does not take any of the experimental variables such,&#xD;
      as treatment, phenotype, tissue, etc., into account while clustering.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ingenuity Pathway analysis (IPA) is fundamental role to determine gene expression and&#xD;
      protein-protein interactions within the context of metabolic or signaling pathways, and to&#xD;
      understand how proteins operate and form pathways, in the context of the selected expression&#xD;
      profiles. IPA is a powerful curated database and analysis system for understanding how&#xD;
      proteins work together to effect cellular changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gene expression profiles to be considered for validation on SLB were published (Respiratory&#xD;
      Research 2018 Aug 15;19:153). The gene signature of NSIP consists of 86 genes, while the gene&#xD;
      signature of IPF consists of 60 genes. Receiver operating characteristics analysis will be&#xD;
      used to determine the accuracy of gene expression analysis in determining the diagnosis of&#xD;
      IPF vs. NSIP (area under the curve, sensitivity, specificity).&#xD;
&#xD;
      RT-PCR Ribosomal protein large P0 will be used as housekeeping gene. Based on our previous&#xD;
      results on lung explants, 6 genes will be tested as discriminators of IPF vs. NSIP on lung&#xD;
      homogenates from SLB. All genes were cross checked against normal controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test will be used to assess demographic,&#xD;
      functional and RT-PCR variables' distribution. For comparison of groups (IPF vs. NSIP),&#xD;
      either unpaired t-test or the Mann-Whitney test, where indicated, will be used. Cox&#xD;
      proportional hazard analysis and receiver operating characteristics will be used to determine&#xD;
      the strength of RT-PCR variables in predicting outcome. Kappa statistics will be used to&#xD;
      asses diagnostic agreement during MDD. Receiver operating characteristics analysis will be&#xD;
      used to assess diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity, specificity, area under the curve).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition of diagnosis and post-biopsy clinical course The specific diagnosis of IIP (IPF&#xD;
      vs. NSIP) will be defined based on multi-disciplinary discussion (MDD) among treating&#xD;
      clinician, chest radiologist and lung pathologist, taking into consideration clinical&#xD;
      information chest CT scan radiographic pattern and pathology pattern seen on the SLB. The&#xD;
      diagnosis will be reached by consensus, as per current standard of practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To validate the diagnosis, patients will be followed for a period of 3 years after the SLB.&#xD;
      Rate of clinical progression and survival are significantly different in IPF vs. NSIP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical progression from the time of diagnosis (SLB) will be defined as either: &gt;10%&#xD;
      absolute reduction in forced vital capacity (FVC) % pred; &gt;50 m decline in 6-minute walk&#xD;
      distance (6MWD); admission to hospital for respiratory causes; lung transplantation (LTx)&#xD;
      assessment; or death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinic visits take place at 4-6 months intervals, as dictated by the clinician. At each&#xD;
      visit, MRC dyspnea score, pulmonary function tests and 6-minute walk tests data will be&#xD;
      collected.&#xD;
