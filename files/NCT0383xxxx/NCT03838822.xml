  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a strong correlation between major adverse health consequences of obesity and&#xD;
      development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NAFLD is characterized by abnormal&#xD;
      hepatic accumulation of triglycerides and other lipids. It has become a worldwide health&#xD;
      problem that accelerates cirrhosis, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and especially premature&#xD;
      cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The plasma level of glutathione (GSH) is typically depleted in individuals with metabolism&#xD;
      related disorders. However, cellular GSH levels cannot be increased by supplementing GSH and&#xD;
      it must be synthesized within the liver either de novo or by salvation pathway. The level of&#xD;
      GSH is not enough to maintain and regulate the thiol redox status of the liver in subjects&#xD;
      with high hepatic steatosis at fasting stage due to the depletion of glycine. Glycine can be&#xD;
      synthesized via the interconversion of serine. It has been shown that the serine synthesis is&#xD;
      downregulated in patients with NAFLD and supplementation of serine has attenuated alcoholic&#xD;
      fatty liver by enhancing homocysteine metabolism in mice and rats. Depleted liver glutathione&#xD;
      is also restored by the administration of N-acetylcystein as in acetaminophen poising.&#xD;
      L-carnitine and nicotinamide that both stimulate the transfer of fatty acids from cytosol to&#xD;
      mitochondria have been identified as two additional cofactors that are depleted in patients&#xD;
      with NAFLD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the kinetics in blood of pivotal metabolic cofactors, serine, L-carnitine,&#xD;
      N-acetylcystein and nicotinamide after single and simultaneous dietary supplementation, are&#xD;
      measured.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In 10 healthy subjects with BMI &lt;30 kg/m2 the plasma concentrations of 4 natural compounds&#xD;
      (nicotinamide riboside, L-carnitine, L-serine and N-acetylcystein) are measured by&#xD;
      ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLCMSMS) after individual&#xD;
      and combined administration, on five consecutive days and at every hour during 9 hours after&#xD;
      administration. The study will start at 8:00 every morning and at each time point, blood&#xD;
      samples will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The taste and any potential sensing of the co-factors such as vertigo, nausea, bowel movement&#xD;
      will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will receive one oral dose of Day 1: 1 g nicotinamide riboside; Day 2: 3 g&#xD;
      L-carnitine; Day 3: 5 g N-acetylcystein; Day 4: 20 g L-serine; Day 5: combined 1 g&#xD;
      nicotinamide riboside, 3 g L-carnitine, 5 g N-acetylcystein, and 20 g L-serine&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, untargeted metabolomics analysis as well as O-link proteomics analysis we be&#xD;
      performed to study effect of the administered cofactors.&#xD;
