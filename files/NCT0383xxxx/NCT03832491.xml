  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Impaired pulmonary function, decreased physical activity, functional capacity and depending&#xD;
      on these factors are reported in patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia in recent studies.&#xD;
      The purpose of this study to evaluate the effects of game based approach on pulmonary&#xD;
      function, functional capacity and quality of life in patients with primary ciliary dykinesia.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is an autosomal recessive hereditary disorder characterized&#xD;
      by congenital structural abnormalities and impairment of respiratory function. Mucociliary&#xD;
      clearance is affected by disorders in the structure and movement of cilia. That causes&#xD;
      repeated infections in the upper and lower respiratory tract.In addition to mucociliary&#xD;
      effects and impaired lung function, it is thought that there may be a decrease in respiratory&#xD;
      muscle strength and functional capacity. One of the factors affecting functional capacity is&#xD;
      the level of physical activity. For these reasons, the management of the respiratory system&#xD;
      in patients with PCD is very important. In addition to airway clearence techniques,&#xD;
      approaches to increase physical activity are also important. It was thought that severe&#xD;
      physical activity could be an important determinant of cardiopulmonary functional capacity in&#xD;
      patients with mild to moderate PCD. The level of physical activity is known to be associated&#xD;
      with quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In literature no study investigated the effects of game based approach on oxygenation,&#xD;
      functional capacity and quality of life in patients with PCD. Game based approach is a new&#xD;
      method lead to increase physical activity. In literature there is no study investigated the&#xD;
      effects of game based approach on oxygenation, functional capacity and quality of life in&#xD;
      patients with PCD.&#xD;
