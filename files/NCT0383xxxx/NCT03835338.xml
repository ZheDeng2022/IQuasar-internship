      WATCH-Rhythm is a prospective, randomized, multi-center, investigation to collect safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness data on combining conventional AF ablation with LAA electric isolation and&#xD;
      occlusion within a single procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to test the effectiveness of adding LAA electrical isolation and&#xD;
      closure to conventional atrial fibrillation versus conventional atrial fibrillation alone in&#xD;
      treating patient with persistent atrial fibrillation from a single procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted at up to 10 global sites in the European Union (United Kingdom,&#xD;
      Spain, Germany, or others). The maximum enrollment ceiling for the Watch-Rhythm study is 278&#xD;
      subjects. Included in the enrollment ceiling are up to 20 roll-in subjects and a maximum of&#xD;
      258 randomized subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of the study is expected to last approximately 4 years. Enrollment is expected&#xD;
      to take approximately 24 months. The duration of individual subject participation is expected&#xD;
      to last approximately 2 years but may vary per subject.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The subject is of legal age to participate in the study per the laws of their&#xD;
             respective geography.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The subject has documented non-valvular persistent AF. For this protocol, the&#xD;
             definition of persistent AF is sustained arrhythmia lasting at least 7-days but less&#xD;
             than 36 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The subject is able to tolerate OAC post ablation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject is able to undergo TEE.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The subject or legal representative is able to understand and willing to provide&#xD;
             written informed consent to participate in the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The subject is willing and capable of attending all follow-up visits at the&#xD;
             investigational site as medically appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The subject is unable or unwilling to return for required follow-up visits and&#xD;
             examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The subject had or is planning to have any invasive cardiac procedure within 30 days&#xD;
             prior to randomization (e.g., cardioversion, ablation).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Previous AF ablation (surgical or percutaneous).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Prior MAZE procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The subject is planning to have any cardiac or non-cardiac invasive or surgical&#xD;
        procedure that would necessitate stopping or modifying the protocol required medication&#xD;
        regimen within 90 days after the WATCHMAN Closure Device implant (e.g., cardioversion,&#xD;
        ablation, cataract surgery).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The subject had a prior BARC type 3 or 4 bleeding event within the 14 days prior to&#xD;
        randomization. Lack of resolution of related clinical sequelae, or planned and pending&#xD;

        timing of the bleeding event.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The subject had a prior stroke (of any cause) or TIA within the 30 days prior to&#xD;
        randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;

        randomization. Lack of resolution of related clinical sequelae, or planned and pending&#xD;
        interventions to resolve bleeding/bleeding source, or a further exclusion regardless of&#xD;
        timing of the bleeding event.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. The subject has a history of atrial septal repair or has an ASD/PFO device. 9. The&#xD;
        subject has an implanted mechanical valve prosthesis in any position. 10. The subject&#xD;
        suffers from New York Heart Association Class IV Congestive Heart Failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        11. Subject has LVEF &lt;30% 12. Subject has hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. 13. The subject has&#xD;
        had a myocardial infarction (MI) documented in the clinical record as either a non-ST&#xD;
        elevation MI (NSTEMI) or as an ST elevation MI (STEMI), with or without intervention,&#xD;
        within 90 days prior to randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        14. The subject is of childbearing potential and is, or plans to become pregnant during the&#xD;
        time of the study (method of assessment upon study physician's discretion).&#xD;
&#xD;
        15. The subject is currently enrolled in another investigational study or registry that&#xD;
        would directly interfere with the current study, except when the subject is participating&#xD;
        in a mandatory governmental registry, or a purely observational registry with no associated&#xD;
        treatments. Each instance should be brought to the attention of the sponsor to determine&#xD;
        eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
        16. The subject has a documented life expectancy of less than two years. 17. The subject&#xD;
        has a known or suspected hypercoagulable state&#xD;
