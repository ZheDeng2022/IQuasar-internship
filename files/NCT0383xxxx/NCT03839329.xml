  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study aims to explore the impact of a two-session group Acceptance and Commitment&#xD;
      Therapy (ACT) intervention compared to an assessment-only control on psychological outcomes&#xD;
      in healthy older adults. The proposed study has two main objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Examine the impact the intervention on targeted ACT processes over time&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Examine the impact of the intervention on aspects of eudaimonic well-being over time&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Older adults are a growing segment of our population, and this period of life presents a&#xD;
      variety of physical, emotional, environmental, and cognitive changes, even for healthy&#xD;
      individuals. The current study aims to explore the impact of a two-session group Acceptance&#xD;
      and Commitment Therapy (ACT) intervention compared to an assessment-only control on&#xD;
      psychological outcomes in healthy, community-dwelling older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned (stratified by sex) to the ACT group condition or to&#xD;
      an assessment-only control group. After randomization, those in the assessment-only control&#xD;
      group will be asked to complete four assessments via mail (baseline, one-month, three-month,&#xD;
      and six-month). The intervention group will participate in a brief group ACT intervention&#xD;
      occurring over two sessions (90 minutes each, approximately one week apart). Intervention&#xD;
      participants will also complete assessments at baseline and at one-month, three-months, and&#xD;
      six-months post-intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims and hypotheses of the current study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #1: To examine longitudinal between-group differences in targeted ACT processes&#xD;
      including psychological flexibility (openness to experience, behavioral awareness, and valued&#xD;
      action) and satisfaction with social roles and activities from baseline to follow-up. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that there will be significant time by group interaction, such that psychological&#xD;
      flexibility and satisfaction with social roles and activities will increase significantly&#xD;
      more in the intervention group relative to the assessment-only control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #2: To examine longitudinal between-group differences in eudaimonic well-being&#xD;
      (purpose in life and personal growth) from baseline to follow-up. We hypothesize that there&#xD;
      will be significant time by group interactions, such that purpose in life and personal growth&#xD;
      will increase significantly more in the intervention group relative to the assessment-only&#xD;
      control group.&#xD;
