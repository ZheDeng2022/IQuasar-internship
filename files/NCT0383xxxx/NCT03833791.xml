      Compare the Effect of Different Physical Programs on the Body Composition of Adult Women and&#xD;
      Men With a Total Body Fat Percentage ≥ 30 % at the Beginning of the Test or BMI ≥25&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Weight loss by exercise can be frequently deceptive. The focus continues to be centred around&#xD;
      total body weight and body mass index (BMI), despite the fact that body fat and fat-free mass&#xD;
      are the indicators that represent the greatest risk in the comorbidity associated with&#xD;
      obesity. Body weight per se cannot be considered to be reliable; however, its quality can be&#xD;
      justified, when measured together with the loss in body fat and the maintenance or increase&#xD;
      in fat-free mass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is compare the effect of different physical programs (FA) on the&#xD;
      body composition (BC) of adult women with a total body fat percentage ≥ 30 % and adult men&#xD;
      with a BMI ≥25 at the beginning of the test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants (n=220, women = 110, men = 110) will be recruited through outpatient from&#xD;
      private clinics in Cádiz, Andalucía, Spain, as well as through community presentations.&#xD;
      Overweight or obese and sedentary women and men will be randomly assigned into three groups&#xD;
      according to different levels of AF. 21 of the participants will be assigned to the sedentary&#xD;
      control group (METs &lt;2.9), 20 in a group of moderate AF (METs 3-5.9), and 19 will be assigned&#xD;
      to the group of intense AF (METs &gt;6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For 6 months, all of the women shall follow the same diet with an identical distribution of&#xD;
      macronutrients. There will be a weekly check up of weight, fat, body water and muscle mass&#xD;
      for all of them.&#xD;
