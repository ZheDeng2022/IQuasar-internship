      papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination schedules in young females in West Africa.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, open-label, single-centre, phase 3 non-inferiority clinical trial&#xD;
      of the Gardasil 9 vaccine. It will be undertaken in three female cohorts (15 to 26 years old;&#xD;
      9 to 14 years-olds and 4 to 8 year-olds). In total 1720 female participants will be recruited&#xD;
      in a rural setting in The Gambia, West Africa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Gardasil 9 vaccine is a recombinant L 1 VLP vaccine containing HPV types 6,&#xD;
      11,16,18,31,33,45,52 and 58 VLP. It is licensed by both European Medicines Agency and the US&#xD;
      Food and Drug Administration as a two or three dose schedule to 9 to 14 year olds and as a&#xD;
      three dose schedule to 15 to 26 years olds. The license covers both males and females. The&#xD;
      vaccine is not currently licensed for those under 9 years of age and it is not licenced in&#xD;
      The Gambia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All females within the 15 to 26 year-old cohort will receive three doses of Gardasil 9 at 0,&#xD;
      2 and 6 months and represent the reference group for the purposes of the serological&#xD;
      non-inferiority analysis. This is the only group for which efficacy data for the vaccine are&#xD;
      available. Females in the 9 to 14 year old and 4 to 8 year old cohorts will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive either one or two doses of Gardasil 9. In both groups, the two doses will be&#xD;
      administered at 0 and 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary and secondary immunogenicity objectives will be analysed based on serological&#xD;
      Samples taken 4 to 6 weeks after the last dose of vaccine received according to group.&#xD;
      Additional analysis will be undertaken at 12, 24 and 36 months. The Sampling schedule is&#xD;
      aligned with the schedule in other immunogenicity trials to facilitate comparison and&#xD;
      potential immunobridging to future one-dose efficacy data. In addition, the stability of the&#xD;
      antibody concentrations between 12 and 24 and again between 24 and 36 months according to&#xD;
      schedule and age-group aims to allow longer term predictions regarding the maintenance of&#xD;
      antibody concentration to be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Sub-study will be undertaken within the main trial to compare in detail early immunological&#xD;
      events taking place following Gardasil 9. The quantitative and qualitative changes in these&#xD;
      events following a first and following subsequent doses of the vaccine and also according to&#xD;
      age will be assessed and related to the early and long-term antibody concentrations induced&#xD;
      by the vaccine. There are currently no data exploring the basis for the progressive increase&#xD;
      in the immunogenicity of the HPV vaccines apparent with decreasing age. These may have their&#xD;
      origins in the early innate response following vaccination-which will be assessed at a&#xD;
      cellular as well as transcriptomic level, as well as in the subsequent adaptive profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similarly, the cellular basis for the sustained seropositivity induced by the HPV vaccines&#xD;
      even apparent following a single vaccine dose is little understood. The window onto which&#xD;
      plasmablasts and memory B-cell populations in the circulation is transient following&#xD;
      vaccination. However, enumerating and characterizing these populations and relating them in&#xD;
      the same way to early and long term antibody concentration aims to provide insight into the&#xD;
      relative roles of these populations and how they are influenced by the age of the vaccine and&#xD;
      the number of vaccine doses received.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals in the sub-study will contribute serological data to the main trial and will be&#xD;
      followed up in the same way but will be consented for one additional blood sample after each&#xD;
      vaccination. Up to 120 participant in each group in the main trial will be randomized to&#xD;
      groups A, B or C, with 40 participants in each of these groups. This number aims to generate&#xD;
      a dataset of at least 30 analyzable individuals per schedule and age group.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Parent/participant is willing and judged able to comply with the necessary study&#xD;
             procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Parent/participant does not have established plans to leave the study area for a&#xD;
             prolonged period/indefinitely during the 3 year follow-up period&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant is resident within the study area (no fixed boundaries will be set and&#xD;
             decisions will be made on a case-by-case basis by the study team taking into account&#xD;
             not only distance but also transport links, accessibility for the purposes of safety&#xD;
             data collection, willingness of the parent/participant to travel)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Place of residence of the participant must be readily identifiable&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receipt of other investigational medicinal products (IMP) in a period of 12 months&#xD;
             prior to the day of randomization and vaccination or plans to receive IMP during the&#xD;
             trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of significant chronic health problems requiring long-term medication or&#xD;
             medical follow-up including respiratory, cardiac, gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal,&#xD;
             neurological, musculoskeletal, haematological or other conditions based on parental&#xD;
             history and physical examination of the participant. Participants with known sickle&#xD;
             cell disease (but not sickle cell trait) will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of severe allergic reactions to any prior vaccine or to any component of the&#xD;
             study vaccine (including alum (amorphous aluminum hydroxyphosphate sulphate), yeast or&#xD;
             Benzonase). Severe allergic reactions are defined as reactions requiring urgent&#xD;
             medical intervention including reactions with any degree of cardiorespiratory&#xD;
             compromise. The occurrence of a mild rash without other associated symptoms or signs&#xD;
             does not generally represent an exclusion. Allergic reactions should be distinguished&#xD;
             from the local and systemic reactogenicity expected in the first few days following&#xD;
             vaccination which is not an exclusion to vaccination&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior receipt of an HPV vaccine&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receipt of any vaccine in the 28 days prior to randomization and vaccination‡&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of thrombocytopenia or coagulation disorders which represent contraindications&#xD;
             in intramuscular (IM) vaccination&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known congenital or acquired immune deficiency or history strongly indicative of&#xD;
             abnormal immune function. HIV testing will not be undertaken as part of the routine&#xD;
             screening procedures due to the relatively low prevalence of HIV expected in the&#xD;
             population (~1-3%) and the established safety and immunogenicity profile of Gardasil&#xD;
             in HIV positive individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receipt of medications or other treatments known to suppress the immune system in a&#xD;
             period of 12 months prior to the day of randomization or plans to receive such&#xD;
             medications and treatments during the course of the trial. Such medications and&#xD;
             treatments include but not limited to high dose non-replacement) oral or parenteral&#xD;
             steroids for more than 14 days, chemotherapeutic agents, methotrexate,&#xD;
             cyclophosphamide, cyclosporin, Tacrolimus, any monoclonal antibody therapy and&#xD;
             radiotherapy. The use of topical and inhaled steroids are not exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receipt of intravenous immunoglobulins or blood products within a period of 12 months&#xD;
             prior to the day of randomization and vaccination or plans to receive such products&#xD;
             during the course of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy (females in the 15 to 26 years old cohort will require a urine pregnancy&#xD;
             test as part of the screening procedures and will also have a urine pregnancy test&#xD;
             undertaken prior to the second and third vaccination and vaccination delayed if&#xD;
             pregnancy is confirmed. A minimum of 42 days from the end of pregnancy (irrespective&#xD;
             of outcome) will be left before the delayed vaccination is administered. Participants&#xD;
             who are pregnant at initial screening will not be re-screened but will be defined as&#xD;
             screen failures. Breast feeding is not an exclusion criterion&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Intention to become pregnant within six months of enrollment in the trial.&#xD;
             Confirmation regarding the use of a reliable method of contraception is not required&#xD;
             but females who are actively seeking to become pregnant within six months of&#xD;
             enrollment will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Fever (&gt;38.0°C) on the day of vaccination or documented fever (&gt;38.0°C) within the 24&#xD;
             hours preceding vaccination&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Abnormal (Grade &gt; 1) vital signs (heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure) on the&#xD;
             day of vaccination&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive rapid diagnostic test (RDT) or blood film for malaria on the day of&#xD;
             vaccination&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically-significant (Grade &gt; 2) acute illness present on the day of vaccination&#xD;
             (minor illnesses including upper respiratory tract infections, diarrhoeal illness and&#xD;
             skin complaints not associated with fever or significant systemic upset are not in&#xD;
             themselves reasons for exclusion)&#xD;
