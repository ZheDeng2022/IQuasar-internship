    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Opioids are medicines that control pain. But they are often misused, which can lead to&#xD;
      illness and death. Opioids increase dopamine to the brain, which makes people feel good and&#xD;
      often causes them to crave drugs, leading to misuse and addiction. An investigational drug&#xD;
      ANS-6637 may lower the dopamine surge and stop opioid craving. Midazolam is a drug approved&#xD;
      for anxiety. Researchers want to give the two drugs together and see if ANS-6637 affects&#xD;
      midazolam levels, to help understand how ANS-6637 is used in the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the safety, tolerability, and effects of ANS-6637 taken with and without midazolam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy adults 18 65 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a medical history, physical exam, and blood and heart&#xD;
      tests. Participants who can get pregnant will have a pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants must agree to use 2 types of birth control during the study, if applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will stay at the clinic for 10 days. Meals will be provided. Participants will&#xD;
      not be allowed to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Leave NIH campus&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eat or drink anything with caffeine, alcohol, or certain juices&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use any nicotine or related products (including vaping)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use any medicines (including herbal)&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the clinic stay, participants will:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fast overnight several times&#xD;
&#xD;
      Have blood drawn most days. Twice, a small tube will be inserted in an arm vein for frequent&#xD;
      blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repeat screening tests and answer questions about their mood several times&#xD;
&#xD;
      Get midazolam syrup in water on 1 day&#xD;
&#xD;
      Take 6 ANS-6637 tablets by mouth on 5 days&#xD;
&#xD;
      Take both study drugs on 1 day&#xD;
&#xD;
      A few days later, participants will have a follow-up visit to repeat screening tests and&#xD;
      answer questions about their mood.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Opioid use causes a myriad of effects which contribute to significant morbidity and early&#xD;
      mortality, and is associated with risky sexual behavior and injection drug use (IDU), two&#xD;
      major forms of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) transmission in&#xD;
      urban and suburban United States. Through these high-risk behaviors, persons with opioid use&#xD;
      disorder (OUD) develop both direct comorbidities (e.g. blood stream infections and infectious&#xD;
      endocarditis), as well as risk-associated illnesses (e.g. sexually transmitted infections,&#xD;
      HCV and hepatitis B virus [HBV]) which have considerable downstream health care effects. As&#xD;
      such, there is a need for pharmacologic agents in the treatment of OUD that go beyond&#xD;
      avoidance of withdrawal and facilitate decreased frequency or complete cessation of opioid&#xD;
      use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The biologic mechanism of OUD, common to all forms of addiction, is a conditioned drug&#xD;
      cue-related response in the CNS, causing a dopamine surge. If effective, a central&#xD;
      pharmacologic strategy targeting the aberrant reward circuitry seen in OUD could potentially&#xD;
      reduce drug craving and result in opioid abstinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the SEARCH Pharmacokinetic (PK) investigation, we aim to understand the pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      signal of the novel, oral agent ANS-6637, an aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH-2) inhibitor that&#xD;
      has the potential to reduce dopamine surge in the CNS and inhibit opioid craving. In&#xD;
      preclinical studies, the active metabolite of ANS-6637, GS-548351, showed substrate dependent&#xD;
      inhibition of CYP3A in vitro, with little or no inhibitory effect on the activities of other&#xD;
      cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. As such, the current investigation seeks to explore the&#xD;
      potential inhibition of CYP3A by ANS-6637 with the FDA-recommended CYP3A probe substrate,&#xD;
      midazolam.&#xD;
