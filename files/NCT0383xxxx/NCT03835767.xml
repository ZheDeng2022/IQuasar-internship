  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Atopic dermatitis (AD), also called eczema, makes skin dry, red, and itchy. People with AD&#xD;
      are more likely to get a food allergy than people without AD. But some food allergy tests are&#xD;
      not always accurate in people with AD. Researchers want to study if people are truly allergic&#xD;
      to milk and/or peanuts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To improve the ways doctors test for food allergy in people with AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 3 21 who have had AD; have a high total IgE level (an allergic antibody); might&#xD;
      have a milk and/or peanut allergy; and are currently enrolled in another NIH study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened under another protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a physical exam, blood tests, and medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will breathe into a plastic device that measures lung strength.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may get a small plastic tube inserted in their arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who have not had an allergic reaction to food in the past 3 years will do 1 or&#xD;
      more oral food challenge (OFCs) depending on their allergies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will eat a little bit of the food they might be allergic to.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will be watched for a reaction. If they have one, they will know for sure they are&#xD;
      allergic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They may keep eating bigger portions of the food until they either have a reaction or finish&#xD;
      all the food.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In some OFCs, participants will get a placebo food.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OFCs will last a few hours or 2 days. Participants will repeat all tests at each OFC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation can last up to 12 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Allergy skin prick tests and measurement of food-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels are&#xD;
      common but not robust means to diagnose food allergy, so patients may be placed on overly&#xD;
      restrictive food elimination diets as a result of false positive results. Such restrictions&#xD;
      can lead to poor weight gain, malnutrition, and negative impact on quality of life. More than&#xD;
      half of patients who are sensitized (ie, have a positive IgE test) to a particular food do&#xD;
      not react to it during an oral food challenge, the gold standard for diagnosing food allergy.&#xD;
      Development of food allergy does not always correlate to food-specific IgE levels. The care&#xD;
      of these patients would be dramatically improved if decision points for food-specific or&#xD;
      component IgEs could be identified that predict when an immediate hypersensitivity is&#xD;
      present. This is especially an issue among patients with atopic dermatitis (AD), the most&#xD;
      common chronic, relapsing inflammatory disorder of the skin affecting children. Patients with&#xD;
      AD are more likely to develop other allergic conditions, including food allergy and&#xD;
      sensitization. AD patients are also likely to have high levels of total serum IgE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, participants aged 3-21 years (n = 175) with elevated total serum IgE levels&#xD;
      and a history of AD will undergo open feedings and/or double-blind, placebo-controlled food&#xD;
      challenges (DBPCFCs). Open feedings will be 1- or 2-step, depending on how often the&#xD;
      participant regularly consumes the food at home. There are two DBPCFCs to milk: milk powder&#xD;
      or (placebo) baked into a muffin, and straight milk powder or (placebo) mixed with a vehicle.&#xD;
      The DBPCFC for peanut will be done with peanut flour or (placebo) mixed with a vehicle. Blood&#xD;
      will be collected during the study for measurement of total and component IgEs as well as&#xD;
      potential biomarkers of food sensitization vs. immediate hypersensitivity and reaction&#xD;
      severity. From these data, we hope to identify diagnostic IgE threshold levels that will&#xD;
      inform when oral food challenges are warranted in patients with elevated total serum IgE&#xD;
      levels and AD, which is critically needed in the allergy field to facilitate the care of&#xD;
      these patients.&#xD;
