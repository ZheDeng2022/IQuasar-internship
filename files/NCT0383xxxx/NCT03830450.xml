  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) is the most common complication in patients after cardiac surgery.&#xD;
      An usual estimation of risk for AKI is estimation of serum creatinine, which is unreliable&#xD;
      indicator of AKI risk. Because of that, today different biomarkers are investigated to&#xD;
      predict incidence for development AKI after cardiac surgery. This investigation will try to&#xD;
      find potentially risk patients for developing AKI after cardiac surgery by using conventional&#xD;
      markers (creatinine, glomerular filtration rate) in perioperative period comparing with two&#xD;
      different biomarkers neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and growth&#xD;
      differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15) which are proven markers in patients with increased risk&#xD;
      for AKI development.&#xD;
