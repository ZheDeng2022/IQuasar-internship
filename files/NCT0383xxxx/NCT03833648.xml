  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is estimated that 77% of all Americans own a smartphone and the use of health apps has&#xD;
      doubled in the last two years. Consistent with this development, over half of US smartphone&#xD;
      owners have downloaded a health-related mobile app. While patient engagement is an integral&#xD;
      and well-established component of in-hospital Early Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) programs&#xD;
      that drive improved perioperative outcomes, efforts to support such engagement are often&#xD;
      limited to a patient's hospital stay. The objective of this aim is to empower patients to&#xD;
      control their use of pain medications after surgery in a safe and effective fashion using a&#xD;
      novel and innovative consumer health informatics app: UControlPain. This app will be&#xD;
      leveraged to integrate three critical components of the study into one application: First,&#xD;
      study recruitment and consent documentation. Second, application of the intervention engaging&#xD;
      patients to take control of their pain management after discharge. Lastly, UControlPain will&#xD;
      collect relevant patient outcomes including pain assessments, functional status, and&#xD;
      quantification of opioid and non-opioid analgesic medication intake. Use of the app will&#xD;
      reduce the amount of opioid medication required, while enhancing patient post-operative pain&#xD;
      control by maximizing non-opioid therapy. Subjects will be able to employ flexible non-opioid&#xD;
      therapy with acetaminophen and NSAIDs whenever possible and safe. The rationale is that&#xD;
      testing of such a provider-prescribed consumer health informatics app (UControlPain) will lay&#xD;
      the groundwork to scale this project towards more secure and efficient pain management&#xD;
      practices after surgery on a systems level and beyond. Upon completion, the expectation is to&#xD;
      have developed an effective consumer health informatics app to help patients better manage&#xD;
      their post-surgical pain at home, reduce reliance on opioids, and improve opioid safety&#xD;
      through enhanced storage and disposal behaviors.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prescription opioid overdose has emerged as a leading cause of death in the general&#xD;
      population. Opioid-based therapy represents a corner-stone of post-operative pain management.&#xD;
      With increasing emphasis on robust pain therapy, sales of opioid medications have increased.&#xD;
      Parallel to this rise, opioid-associated deaths have also increased. Over-prescribed opioids&#xD;
      after surgery can create a reservoir of opioids that become available for non-medical use.&#xD;
      Effective strategies to maximize non-opioid pain therapy and to limit such a reservoir are&#xD;
      lacking. Thus, there is an urgent need to individualize post-operative pain therapy and&#xD;
      reduce reliance on opioids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary data indicate that postsurgical patients are prescribed combination preparations&#xD;
      (opioid+acetaminophen) in 96% of cases. Opioid+acetaminophen combination products have&#xD;
      received scrutiny from the FDA for causing liver injury from unintentional overdose when&#xD;
      combined with additional over-the-counter (OTC) acetaminophen. If postoperative patients are&#xD;
      prescribed opioid-only products, they can safely use OTC acetaminophen in addition to NSAIDs,&#xD;
      e.g. ibuprofen, in a highly effective fashion. Such an Alternatives to Opioids (ALTO)-based&#xD;
      approach can reduce the need for opioids while ensuring pain control and limiting&#xD;
      opioid-associated side effects. A barrier to utilizing an ALTO-based approach is lack of&#xD;
      patient knowledge on appropriate use and timing of drugs such as acetaminophen, especially&#xD;
      when used in combination with other analgesics. Internet-based applications have been&#xD;
      successfully used for substance use disorder treatment adherence. Importantly, patient-based&#xD;
      interventions to improve adherence are especially effective in the first six weeks, yielding&#xD;
      up to five-fold improvement in compliance. While consumer health informatics applications&#xD;
      have been successfully tested to improve adherence for anti-depressants and diabetic&#xD;
      medications such an approach has not yet been evaluated for perioperative pain therapy. Data&#xD;
      from an ongoing observational study assessing pain outcomes and patient-reported pain&#xD;
      medication intake after hospital discharge support the assumption that effective combinations&#xD;
      of non-opioid pain medications (ALTO) are underutilized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is using an investigator engineered a functioning prototype of a consumer health&#xD;
      informatics app: UControlPain. This study is a randomized controlled pilot trial of this&#xD;
      consumer health informatics app, to test its effect on pain outcomes, analgesic medication&#xD;
      requirements, and patient functional outcomes. For this study, the UControlPain will be&#xD;
      introduced to hospitalized patients after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be approached regarding interest in the study prior to hospital discharge. A&#xD;
      trained member of the research team will explain the study to prospective participants. If&#xD;
      the patient is interested in participation the consent will be reviewed with the patient and&#xD;
      the study team will answer any questions the patient may have. Then the study staff will&#xD;
      assist the patient in downloading the UControlPain app. The study patient will be provided&#xD;
      with a hard copy of the consent/HIPAA form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographics and the best contact information will be collected from those enrolled patients&#xD;
      who indicate they are interested in completing the surveys after their hospital discharge.&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized to one of two conditions: 1) usual care versus 2) provision of&#xD;
      the provider-prescribed education/tool part of the consumer health informatics app&#xD;
      (UControlPain) using a random electronic 1:1 allocation scheme. If indicated and approved by&#xD;
      the provider, opioid-only prescriptions will be written for opioid-based analgesia in both&#xD;
      groups. Final dosing decisions and drug choices will remain at the discretion of the treating&#xD;
      provider and nursing staff administering medications. While hospitalized patients will also&#xD;
      be prompted to do a 6-minute walk test and measure the number of steps taken within 24 hours&#xD;
      (if cleared by Physical Therapy to walk without assistance). These functional assessments&#xD;
      will be performed daily while hospitalized and weekly for 4 weeks after discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One week after hospital discharge interested patients with be contacted and asked to complete&#xD;
      the first of four surveys. All communication will be available in English. Patients will be&#xD;
      paid with a $5 gift card or money order equivalent to complete the study assessments within&#xD;
      the app or with an online link.&#xD;
&#xD;
      UControlPain will provide general education on how to properly use ALTO, e.g.,&#xD;
      over-the-counter medications before using opioids in patients where providers have not&#xD;
      identified contraindications to such medications (e.g. acetaminophen and non-steroidal&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drugs). Other educational information presented in this part of the app&#xD;
      will include information on safe-storage, signs of overdose, and resources for patients who&#xD;
      are concerned about becoming addicted. The survey part of the study consists of a brief&#xD;
      questionnaire asking about pain management following hospital discharge that will be sent out&#xD;
      weekly x 4 starting one week after hospital discharge.&#xD;
