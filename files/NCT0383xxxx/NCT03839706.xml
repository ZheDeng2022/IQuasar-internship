  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Liver transplantation is the standard treatment for patients with early-stage Hepatocellular&#xD;
      Carcinoma (HCC). Currently, important treatment decisions, like the selection of patients for&#xD;
      transplantation, are made on crude, static tumour characteristics such as the size and number&#xD;
      of lesions that do not reflect other aspects of tumour biology. To date, pre-transplantation&#xD;
      percutaneous biopsy is the best strategy to assess tumoral differentiation and, consequently,&#xD;
      tumor biological behavior. Previous studies have demonstrated that 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose&#xD;
      Positron Emission Tomography Magnetic Resonance Imaging (18F-FDG PET/MRI) may have role in&#xD;
      assessing the HCC tumoral differentiation and predict survival after LT. The Investigators&#xD;
      will assess the accuracy of 18F-FDG PET/MRI as a tool to predict HCC recurrence after liver&#xD;
      transplant. To understand the role of 18F-FDG PET/MRI in prediction of HCC's biological&#xD;
      behavior and upon recurrence, the investigators will try to assess whether the findings in&#xD;
      18F-FDG PET/MRI can predict HCC poor tumoral differentiation, if the findings in 18F-FDG&#xD;
      PET/MRI are related to presence of circulating tumoral DNA in plasma and try to determine the&#xD;
      role of 18F-FDG PET/MRI in predicting HCC recurrence after resection. These findings may&#xD;
      impact the selection criteria for liver transplantation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of death by cancer worldwide, being&#xD;
      responsible for nearly 700,000 deaths in 2012. Liver transplantation (LT) provides the best&#xD;
      results as a curative treatment for patients with early-stage HCC. Other curative treatment&#xD;
      strategies for early stages HCC include resection and ablation. However, the recurrence rates&#xD;
      are higher than LT. Due to organ shortage, better criteria for recipient selection are&#xD;
      necessary. The first widely accepted criteria for graft allocation in HCC patients is the&#xD;
      so-called Milan Criteria (MC): single HCC nodule ≤ 5 cm or 3 nodules all ≤ 3 cm, achieving a&#xD;
      4-y survival of 85%. Recently, MC is seen as too restrictive, its inclusion preventing&#xD;
      patients who might have better survival following LT when compared to other therapies.&#xD;
      Reluctant to have sizing-only criteria, the University of Toronto, since 2004, has applied&#xD;
      the so-called Extended Toronto Criteria (ETC) to LT, which offers transplant to patients with&#xD;
      any size and any number of tumors provide they do not have systemic cancer-related symptoms,&#xD;
      extrahepatic disease, vascular invasion or poorly differentiated tumors. A recent prospective&#xD;
      study conducted at University Health Network (UHN) has shown 5-years survival rates of 68%&#xD;
      when ECT are applied. Recent studies have demonstrated the need to use, besides the lesion&#xD;
      size, variables which can predict the biological behavior of the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, important treatment decisions, like the selection of patients for transplantation,&#xD;
      are made on crude, static tumour characteristics such as the size and number of lesions, but&#xD;
      do not reflect other aspects of tumour biology. To date, pre-transplantation percutaneous&#xD;
      biopsy is the best strategy to assess tumor differentiation and, consequently, tumor&#xD;
      biological behavior. However, HCC is a very complex disease. Microscopic and molecular&#xD;
      analyses have demonstrated a highly heterogeneous degree of cell differentiation. Patients&#xD;
      with more than one tumor may have two or three degrees of cell differentiation between the&#xD;
      tumors. Even within a single HCC nodule, more than one clonal mutations can be present. To&#xD;
      date, there is not a precise method to determinate the degree of differentiation of each&#xD;
      patient's disease and percutaneous core biopsy, an invasive method, is the best estimative&#xD;
      the investigators can reach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since it is impossible to precisely determine the degree of differentiation of HCC with one&#xD;
      single tissue sample, the use of imaging becomes necessary. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)&#xD;
      and enhanced computed tomography (CT) are extensively validated as staging methods for HCC.&#xD;
      The use of 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) Positron Emission Tomography/Magnetic Resonance&#xD;
      Imaging (PET/MRI) is still underevaluated in the field of HCC. However, previous studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated that 18F-FDG PET/CT may have role in assessing the HCC tumoral differentiation&#xD;
      and predict survival after LT. There is no investigation on use of 18F-FDG PET/MRI as a tool&#xD;
      to predict biological behavior in HCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, the Pugh Lab has developed a circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) sequencing assay that&#xD;
      combines a hybrid-capture method with a novel bioinformatics algorithm to enable full-length&#xD;
      sequence analysis of all exons in genes of interest or any other arbitrary genomic region,&#xD;
      rather than mutation hotspots13. With the availability of these technologies in our group,&#xD;
      the investigators next sought to determine whether these methods were applicable to HCC&#xD;
      patients, gathering two innovative tools in transplant patients' care.&#xD;
