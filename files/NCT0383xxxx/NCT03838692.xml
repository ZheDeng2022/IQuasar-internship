  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine in an exploratory manner the objective&#xD;
      overall response rate to ponatinib in the treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic&#xD;
      MTC previously treated with cabozantinib or vandetanib who have tumors with&#xD;
      rearranged-during-transfection (RET) mutations and have tumors without RET mutations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ponatinib is an investigational agent that blocks abnormal cancer proteins and therefore&#xD;
      harms cancer cells. It was recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for leukemia&#xD;
      treatment, but is not approved for medullary thyroid cancer treatment. Early studies,&#xD;
      however, have shown that medullary thyroid tumors respond to ponatinib. These studies were&#xD;
      done in the laboratory and not performed on humans. This is a study designed for patients&#xD;
      with medullary thyroid cancer. Treatment will consist of a drug called ponatinib which is a&#xD;
      pill that taken once each day and continue throughout the duration of the study. The purpose&#xD;
      of the study is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine if this treatment will be effective in decreasing the amount of cancer and, if&#xD;
           it does, to determine how long the response will last.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine the side effects that may occur with this treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To analyze genetic mutations in tumors to help us understand how tumors grow and how&#xD;
           these drugs interact with the mechanisms within the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ponatinib has been given to many patients with leukemia and is now approved by the United&#xD;
      States Food and Drug Administration for treatment of certain types of leukemia. This study&#xD;
      will seek to determine if ponatinib can bring benefit to patients with medullary thyroid&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
