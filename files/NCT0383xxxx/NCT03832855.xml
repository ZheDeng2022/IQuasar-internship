  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a phase I clinical trial will that will use an investigational cancer vaccine&#xD;
      called pING-hHER3FL. pING-hHER3FL is a circular piece of DNA that produces the full length&#xD;
      human HER3 protein and will be used in a phase I study as immunotherapeutic agent to target&#xD;
      cancers that are known to express the human epidermal growth factor receptor HER3. The human&#xD;
      epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) family including: HER1 (also known as EGFR), HER2,&#xD;
      HER3 and HER4 (also known as ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4 respectively) is an important receptor&#xD;
      family for the development of many malignancies. HER3 is overexpressed in breast, lung,&#xD;
      gastric, head and neck, ovarian cancer, and melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this clinical study is to determine the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      pING-hHER3FL in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumor malignancies and to test&#xD;
      whether immunization with pING-hHER3FL can cause a HER3 specific immune response in patients.&#xD;
      Patients enrolled in the study will receive pING-hHER3FL by intramuscular injection (IM)&#xD;
      every 4 weeks for 3 total doses. Potential benefits of the research include learning the&#xD;
      safety of a vaccine targeting HER3 expressing cancers, whether the pING-hHER3FL vaccine can&#xD;
      induce HER3 specific immune responses, and see possible clinical benefit to patients&#xD;
      receiving pING-hHER3FL.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) family including HER1 (also known as EGFR),&#xD;
      HER2, HER3 and HER4 (also known as ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4 respectively) is an important&#xD;
      receptor family for the development of many malignancies. HER3 is overexpressed in breast,&#xD;
      lung, gastric, head and neck, and ovarian cancer and melanoma and its overexpression is&#xD;
      associated with poor prognosis. Because of the negligible tyrosine kinase function of HER3,&#xD;
      it is typically present in heterodimers with HER1 or HER2, through which downstream signaling&#xD;
      occurs involving extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 and AKT. In breast cancer,&#xD;
      HER3 is associated with resistance to anti-HER2 therapeutics. HER3 is also one of several&#xD;
      important causes of endocrine resistance in breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A HER3 specific cancer vaccine that induces polyclonal antibody and T cell responses can&#xD;
      provide long term anti-HER3 immune responses and potentially prevent the emergence of&#xD;
      resistant clones. In addition to the long term protection afforded by vaccination, polyclonal&#xD;
      immune responses to a target protein may offer additional benefits. It has been established&#xD;
      that the binding of multiple antibodies to different epitopes is more efficient than a single&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody in mediating receptor internalization. Additionally, T cell responses&#xD;
      induced by vaccination are also a potent mechanism of tumor rejection in numerous animal&#xD;
      studies and the adoptive transfer of T cells in human clinical trials has shown clinical&#xD;
      efficacy. Although HER3 is expressed on a number of normal tissues, and is only rarely&#xD;
      mutated in cancers, it remains an attractive immunotherapeutic target as it is not abundant&#xD;
      on the cell surface in normal cells, tumor cells may have higher levels of membrane-bound&#xD;
      HER3, and HER3 peptides are presented on the cell surface by MHC complexes for presentation&#xD;
      to T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety of immunization with pING-hHER3&#xD;
      in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumor malignancies. The study will also monitor&#xD;
      immune responses to HER3 and preliminary data on survival and tumor response rate will be&#xD;
      collected.&#xD;
