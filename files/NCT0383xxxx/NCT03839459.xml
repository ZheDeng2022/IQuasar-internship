    <textblock>
      This study will assess the safety and tolerability of denosumab in smoldering multiple&#xD;
      myeloma subjects as well to see if denosumab can reduce subjects' risk of getting multiple&#xD;
      myeloma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, Phase II trial of denosumab 120mg subcutaneous (SC) for patients with&#xD;
      smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM). Subjects will be recruited from the James P. Wilmot Cancer&#xD;
      Center, University of Rochester in Rochester, New York. Patients seen in the inpatient or&#xD;
      outpatient setting with histologically confirmed SMM will be evaluated for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      20 patients will be treated as follows: Denosumab: day 1 = 120mg SC every 4 weeks for 12&#xD;
      cycles. Cycles will be 28 days in length. Patients will be followed after completion of the&#xD;
      study per standard of care for progression free survival for an additional 2 years after the&#xD;
      last dose of denosumab. All patients will take daily vitamin D and calcium supplements of at&#xD;
      least 1200mg elemental calcium and 800IU of vitamin D unless documented hypercalcemia&#xD;
      develops on study. Pre-existing hypocalcemia must be corrected prior to initiating therapy&#xD;
      with denosumab. Serum vitamin D levels will be checked during screening and should be&#xD;
      repleted to a total 25-hydroxyvitamin D level ≥30ng/mL.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient has confirmed SMM according to the definition of the International Myeloma&#xD;
             Working Group (IMWG) definition: serum M-protein ≥3 g/dL or BMPC &gt;10% but less than&#xD;
             60%, or both, along with normal organ and marrow function (CRAB) within 4 weeks prior&#xD;
             to baseline. C: Absence of hypercalcemia, evidenced by a calcium ≤11 mg/dL. R: Absence&#xD;
             of renal failure, evidenced by a creatinine ≤ 2.0mg/dL A: Absence of anemia, evidenced&#xD;
             by a hemoglobin ≥10 g/dL.&#xD;

             duration. Subjects who are surgically sterile (e.g. history of bilateral tubal&#xD;
             ligation, hysterectomy) or whose sexual partner is sterile (e.g. history of vasectomy)&#xD;
             are not required to use additional contraceptive measures.&#xD;
