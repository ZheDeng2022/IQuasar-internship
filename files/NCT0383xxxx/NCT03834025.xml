  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project seeks to examine a critical barrier to optimizing the health care workforce for&#xD;
      the treatment of opioid use disorders. Without a dramatic increase in the number of primary&#xD;
      care providers trained and comfortable with the many nuances of prescribing&#xD;
      medication-assisted treatment (MAT), the staggering increases in opioid overdose deaths will&#xD;
      continue to skyrocket. However, Drug Addiction Treatment Act (DATA) 2000 waiver training&#xD;
      alone is not enough to facilitate prescribing for patients who desperately need services; an&#xD;
      estimated 40% of physicians with waivers do not initiate MAT prescriptions. To address this&#xD;
      problem, North Carolina developed a learning collaborative framework to promote MAT training.&#xD;
      Learning collaboratives have been shown to be an efficacious approach to increase utilization&#xD;
      of MAT, but engagement among providers in North Carolina has been low. To date, the need to&#xD;
      encourage provider collaborative participation at scale has not been addressed. This is the&#xD;
      critical problem focused on in this proposal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The death rate from accidental opioid overdoses continues to climb at an alarming rate, with&#xD;
      overdose deaths in 2016 almost five times the number from 1999. The daily death rate from&#xD;
      opioid overdoses in the U.S. alone is now estimated at 115, so every day that evidence-based&#xD;
      treatment is not available leads to more preventable deaths. North Carolina is one of the&#xD;
      states with both an opioid overdose death rate greater than the national average (11.9 vs&#xD;
      10.4 deaths per 100,000, age-adjusted) and a rate of increase in opioid overdose deaths&#xD;
      greater than the national average (19% vs. 16%). North Carolina is also one of four states&#xD;
      with an Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) funded Extension for Community&#xD;
      Healthcare Outcomes (ECHO) MAT learning collaborative available to primary care practices,&#xD;
      but engagement among providers is low. While the main barriers to engagement are incompletely&#xD;
      understood, recent evidence from provider interviews conducted by the study team in December&#xD;
      2017 and January 2018 suggest that one substantial barrier is the time required for weekly&#xD;
      ECHO clinics.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is designed to assess how to effectively recruit and enroll primary care providers&#xD;
      into participation into an ECHO MAT learning collaborative. For study participants that&#xD;
      enroll in the learning collaborative, the study team will track participation over 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed to be implemented in two phases. Phase 1 is the recruitment phase.&#xD;
      Providers will be randomized to receive recruitment letters and emails from 1 of 4&#xD;
      conditions. Randomization for this phase will occur at the practice level, as determined by&#xD;
      provider address.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants that contact the study team and enroll in the study will begin Phase 2 of the&#xD;
      study. In Phase 2 of the study participants will be randomly assigned to rewards for&#xD;
      participation in ECHO MAT learning collaborative. Their participation in the learning&#xD;
      collaborative will be tracked. Phase 2 of the study is a pilot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary care providers will receive recruitment letters, and may receive emails and phone&#xD;
      calls based on the recruitment condition they are assigned to.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed Consent:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since it is not possible to consent before recruitment, participants will complete the&#xD;
      informed consent process at the beginning of Phase 2 of the study. The consent form will be&#xD;
      shared with eligible participants when they contact the study team to enroll. Before&#xD;
      enrolling in the ECHO MAT learning collaborative, participants will be asked to provide&#xD;
      consent in order to enroll in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1: Primary care providers will be randomized by practice to 1 of 4 study arms.&#xD;
      Computerized randomization will assign practices to study arms, practices and primary care&#xD;
      providers will have an equal chance of being randomized to each study arm .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: Eligible participants will be randomized to the Phase 2 study arm upon enrollment in&#xD;
      the study. Randomization will be assigned using a predetermined randomly ordered list of&#xD;
      study condition assignments. Upon enrolling in the study, the participants will be assigned&#xD;
      to the condition that is next on the list. Participants will have an equal chance of being&#xD;
      randomized to each study arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment for Phase 1 will occur when participants contact study staff with interest in the&#xD;
      study or to enroll. Any primary care providers that are sent letters but do not contact study&#xD;
      staff will be included in study analyses as 'No' for outcomes for Phase 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment for Phase 2 will occur throughout the 6 months after participants enroll in the&#xD;
      study. Outcomes for this study phase are related to participation in ECHO MAT learning&#xD;
      collaboratives, which is tracked for each training by study staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detailed Description of the Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 recruitment letters are designed in a 2 (prosocial mention of need for primary care&#xD;
      providers trained in opioid use disorder treatment vs. none) x 2 (mention of additional&#xD;
      practice supports available for participation in training vs. none). This yields 4 study&#xD;
      conditions for recruitment letters: 1) Letter including prosocial messages and additional&#xD;
      mention of practice supports available for participation, 2) Letter including prosocial&#xD;
      messages but no additional mention of practice support available for participation, 3) Letter&#xD;
      including an additional mention of practice support available for participation but no&#xD;
      prosocial messages, and 4) Recruitment as usual letter that does not include prosocial&#xD;
      messages or an additional mention of practice support available for participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 examines participation in the learning community by group. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups. At this time the investigators are not disclosing the&#xD;
      Phase 2 conditions, and will disclose these at the end of the study, as approved by UNC's&#xD;
      institutional review board (IRB).&#xD;

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Recruitment materials were determined by the randomization of Phase 1. There were four types of recruitment materials: (1) recruitment as usual (no prosocial messaging, no reference to compensation); (2) no prosocial messaging, no reference to compensation; (3) prosocial messaging, reference to compensation; (4) prosocial messaging, reference to compensation.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Once a participant was enrolled, then they were randomized for Phase 2. Phase 2 involved three levels of compensation: no compensation, 30% compensation, 100% compensation. Participants were compensated for each learning collaborative attended based on the Phase 2 randomization.</pre_assignment_details>
