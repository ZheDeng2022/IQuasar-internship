      Hypothesis: There will be an additional reduction of pocket depth and gain of clinical&#xD;
      attachment when dehydrated human amnion-chorion membrane (dHACM) is placed into the&#xD;
      periodontal disease defect after mechanical scaling and root planing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: to compare the clinical and radiographical outcome of using dehydrated human&#xD;
      amnion-chorion membrane (dHACM) (commercially available as BioXclude®) with mechanical&#xD;
      scaling and root planing.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study product BioXclude™ is an Amnion-Chorion allograft membrane, a new membrane made&#xD;
      from human amniotic tissue donated from elective Caesarean section births. Amniotic sacs have&#xD;
      been used since the early 1900's to promote skin wound healing. All donated tissue has been&#xD;
      carefully screened and tested to reduce the risk of transmitting disease. BioXclude™ is&#xD;
      commercially available as a dental wound covering, for bone reconstruction procedures, and as&#xD;
      a treatment for receding gums, and the manufacturer has met all federal requirements for&#xD;
      distributing this product. However, the use of the membrane for this research treatment of&#xD;
      periodontal disease is investigational. BioXclude™ does not meet the criteria for FDA&#xD;
      oversight as a drug, device or biologic and is regulated as a Human Cells, Tissues, and&#xD;
      Cellular and Tissue based product. The product is designed for use as wound covering in a&#xD;
      variety of dental applications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quadrants (right/left, upper/lower) of the mouth will randomly be assigned by block&#xD;
      randomization via flip of a coin with either 1) scaling and root planing alone, or 2) scaling&#xD;
      and root planing with 8 x 8mm Dehydrated Human Amnion/Chorion Membrane (dHACM) placement&#xD;
      within the periodontal pocket at &gt;5mm sites. The participant will act as their own control.&#xD;
      There will be one side of the mouth that will receive the dHACM intervention with scaling and&#xD;
      root planning, and one side that will be the control (scaling and root planning only).&#xD;
      Depending on the extent of the disease (&gt;5mm probing depths) the intervention may involve&#xD;
      upper and lower jaws on that side of the mouth or only one jaw per side (1-2&#xD;
      interventions/1-2 controls per mouth). The addition of dHACM will be a one-time placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The only research-related procedures that will differ from standard of care are standardizing&#xD;
      the x-rays (with custom bite block), placement of the dehydrated human amnion-chorion&#xD;
      membrane (dHACM), supra-gingival cleaning at 3 and 6 months (instead of supra- and&#xD;
      sub-gingival) and x-rays taken at 9 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two examiners (board certified periodontists) completing the periodontal examination will&#xD;
      be blinded to the treatment allocated to the participant by the clinical provider (graduate&#xD;
      periodontal resident or hygienist). Clinical measurements which are standard of care of a&#xD;
      periodontal examination will include: probing depth, bleeding on probing, clinical attachment&#xD;
      level, mobility, and plaque index (Sillness and Loe index). Probing measurements will be made&#xD;
      at 6 location points on all teeth in the dentition using a calibrated University of North&#xD;
      Carolina (UNC) periodontal probe with readings made to the nearest millimeter. Clinical&#xD;
      attachment levels will be made from the cemento-enamel junction or nearest landmark. All&#xD;
      sites with probing depths measuring &gt;4mm will be measured a second time, and the average of&#xD;
      the 2 readings will be used as the site-specific probing depth endpoint. Concomitant&#xD;
      medications and safety evaluation will be recorded at each visit. Any suspected adverse&#xD;
      events or allergic responses will be evaluated by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical measurements will be made at the following time points: baseline; Month 1; Month 3;&#xD;
      Month 6; Month 9. Four bitewing radiographs will be taken for evaluation with custom bite&#xD;
      mounting utilizing a long cone paralleling technique and will be made at: baseline; Month 9.&#xD;
      Baseline x-rays are the standard of care for a periodontal examination. Standardizing the&#xD;
      x-rays with a custom bite block and re-taking the x-rays at 9 months are for research-related&#xD;
      procedures. Participants will be instructed not to perform interproximal oral hygiene for 7&#xD;
      days following treatment. At the 1, 3, 6 and 9 month follow up visits, Participants will be&#xD;
      instructed on the Bass brushing technique as well as the proper use of dental floss as is&#xD;
      standard of care for oral hygiene instructions. At the 3 and 6-month visits, supra-gingival&#xD;
      plaque removal will be performed. At the completion of the study (9 months) supra- and&#xD;
      sub-gingival scaling will be performed as indicated for each participant. Plaque removal is&#xD;
      the standard of care for maintaining a periodontally diseased participant. For research due&#xD;
      to the placement of the membrane, sub-gingival cleaning will be avoided at 3 and 6 months and&#xD;
      the cleaning will be supra-gingival only. This differs from the standard of care, which would&#xD;
      have sub- and supra-gingival cleaning at 3 and 6 months. Cleaning will return to standard of&#xD;
      care at 9 months, where participants will have sub- and supra-gingival cleaning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To summarize, the standard of care will be followed for the initial x-rays, clinical&#xD;
      measurements, scaling and root planing, 1 month re-evaluation, 3, 6 and 9 month cleaning&#xD;
      visits. For the standard of care non-standardized x-rays are normally used. For research&#xD;
      purposes, the investigators will be standardizing the x-rays with a custom bite block and&#xD;
      re-taking x-rays at 9 months. In addition for research purposes we will be placing the&#xD;
      dehydrated human amnion-chorion membrane (dHACM), and having supra-gingival cleanings at 3&#xD;
      and 6 months (instead of supra- and sub-gingival).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three examiners (board certified periodontists) will be calibrated to each other for the&#xD;
      collection of the data and interexaminer reliability will be calculated. The three examiners&#xD;
      will be calibrated for probing depth and clinical attachment levels by reproducing clinical&#xD;
      measurements on a single participant until the measurements are consistently within 0.5 and&#xD;
      the percentage is 95 percent agreement&#xD;
