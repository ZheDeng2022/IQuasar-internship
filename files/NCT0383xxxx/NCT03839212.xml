  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the feasibility of an intervention to prevent chronic&#xD;
      diseases like diabetes, high blood pressure, and obesity in midlife and older Latino adults&#xD;
      living with HIV. The investigators expect that the participant will be in this study for&#xD;
      seven months. Participants will be interviewed and asked to take part in walking groups.&#xD;

    <description>A total cholesterol value of less than 200 mg/dL (5.18 mmol/L) is desirable and 240 mg/dL (6.22 mmol/L) or higher is high. Average HDL-C level is 40-50 mg/dL (1.0-1.3 mmol/L) for men. Low HDL-C level, increased risk, is less than 40 mg/dL (1.0 mmol/L). Optimal LDL-C levels are less than 100 mg/d while high levels are 160-189 mg/dL (4.15-4.90 mmol/L). Desirable triglyceride levels are less than 150 mg/dL (1.70 mmol/L) while high levels are considered 200-499 mg/dL (2.3-5.6 mmol/L).</description>
