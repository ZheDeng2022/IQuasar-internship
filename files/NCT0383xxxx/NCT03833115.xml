  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is an urgent need to develop non-hormonal innovative preventive measures under the&#xD;
      control of women that can prevent unintended pregnancy. Based on our experimental data, the&#xD;
      use of a gel formulation containing SLS could represent a potent and safe topical vaginal&#xD;
      spermicide. The impact of such a preventive tool on public health will be enormous. After&#xD;
      successfully completing supportive Phase I/II safety trials, the next step is a prospective&#xD;
      pilot clinical trial to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of our gel formulation as a&#xD;
      spermicidal agent and for preventing unintended pregnancy in healthy women.&#xD;

      Study objectives (Outcomes):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective (Primary outcome) of this clinical trial is to evaluate the spermicidal&#xD;
      efficacy in vitro and in post-coital test of gel formulation containing or not 2% SLS, when&#xD;
      applied once intravaginally in healthy volunteers (women with their stable male sexual&#xD;
      partners).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective (Secondary outcome) of the study is to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy in preventing pregnancy of the gel formulation containing 2% SLS when&#xD;
      used repeatedly before each sexual intercourse for a period of 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Pilot trial First phase- During volunteers screening for eligibility, male&#xD;
      sexual partners will submit sperm samples; half of the sperm sample will be used for&#xD;
      spermogram, and the other half of the sperm sample will be used (if normal spermogram) for in&#xD;
      vitro testing of the spermicidal efficacy of the gel formulation components. If eligible, the&#xD;
      man and his eligible female sex partner will be enrolled. Eligible women of the eligible male&#xD;
      sex partners will have one vaginal gel application up to 30 min before planned sexual&#xD;
      intercourse (vaginal penile penetration) with male ejaculating inside the vagina. Women will&#xD;
      come to the clinic within a maximum of 12h period after the sexual intercourse for&#xD;
      post-coital test. The gel must not be applied during menstrual period. The use of other&#xD;
      vaginal products and male condom by participants is prohibited during the study period. A&#xD;
      diary will be given to participants to record information concerning the internal use, if&#xD;
      any, of any vaginal product (including tampons). This pilot trial will be performed in 1&#xD;
      center at the facilities of the Clinical Research of the CHU de Québec-Université Laval,&#xD;
      CHUL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second phase- Couples agreeing to use the product repeatedly will continue to use the gel-SLS&#xD;
      before each and every sexual intercourse, except during menstruation, for a period of 3&#xD;
      months. Women will report safety parameters after each vaginal use of the gel-SLS and will be&#xD;
      followed regularly at the facilities of the Clinical Research of the CHU de Québec-Université&#xD;
      Laval, CHUL.&#xD;
