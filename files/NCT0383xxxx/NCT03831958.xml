      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pituitary gland produces hormones. A tumor in this gland can cause it to produce too much&#xD;
      of the hormone cortisol. Too much cortisol in the body causes Cushing disease. This disease&#xD;
      causes many problems. Some of these problems might persist after the disease is cured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To find out the long-term effects of exposure to high levels of cortisol during childhood and&#xD;
      adolescence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 10-42years who were diagnosed with Cushing disease before age 21 and are now&#xD;
      cured and have normal or low cortisol levels&#xD;
&#xD;
      People related to someone with Cushing disease&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete an online survey. This will include questions about their or their&#xD;
      child s physical and mental health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be seen at 5 -year intervals after cure of Cushing disease (5yr, 10yr,&#xD;
      15yr, 20yr (last visit))&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who have a relative with Cushing disease will have a medical history and blood&#xD;
      tests or cheek swabs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who have the disease will have:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cheek swab&#xD;
&#xD;
      DXA scan: A machine will x-ray the participant s body to measure bone mineral content.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For participants who are still growing, a hand x-ray&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with the disease may also have:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hormone stimulation test: Participants will get a hormone or another substance that will be&#xD;
      measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serial hormone sampling: Participants blood will be measured several times through a thin&#xD;
      plastic tube in an arm vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine tests: Participants urine may be collected over 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI: Participants may have a dye injected into a vein. They will lie on a table that slides&#xD;
      into a machine. The machine will take pictures of the body.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cushing Disease (CD) describes the state of hypercortisolemia secondary to cortisol producing&#xD;
      pituitary adenomas. The rarity of the disease (2-5 new cases per million, 1 out of 10 in&#xD;
      children) and the subtle initial findings result in prolonged undiagnosed hypercortisolemia,&#xD;
      that increases the risk for significant complications, including obesity, height&#xD;
      deceleration, hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, hypertension, osteoporosis, immunodeficiency,&#xD;
      and others. Although hypercortisolemia usually resolves after successful resection of the&#xD;
      pituitary adenoma, the reversal of the abovementioned complications and the long-term effects&#xD;
      of the previous prolonged exposure of the body to supraphysiologic levels of cortisol have&#xD;
      not been clarified, especially when hypercortisolemia occurs during childhood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have addressed the possible complications after resolution of&#xD;
      hypercortisolemia, but most of them refer to adult patients. Amongst the described&#xD;
      complications, suppression of the pituitary hormones, such as the growth and thyroid hormone&#xD;
      axes, and persistent increase of the body mass index (BMI) and abnormal fat distribution,&#xD;
      have been described in limited number of pediatric patients followed for a few years after&#xD;
      cure. Other complications, such as components of the metabolic syndrome or cardiovascular&#xD;
      dysfunction, have not been extensively studied in children. Furthermore, equally important&#xD;
      are the long-term effects of glucocorticoids on other aspects of health. For example, it has&#xD;
      been previously described that the neurocognitive function of children with CD declines the&#xD;
      first year after treatment. This can potentially result in impaired quality of life, lower&#xD;
      education level, and lower job and life satisfaction in the future; however, the long-term&#xD;
      neurocognitive sequelae of Cushing syndrome (CS) diagnosed in childhood have not been&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to provide novel insight on the long-term effects of hypercortisolemia on the&#xD;
      developing child, their underlying pathogenetic mechanisms, their evolution over time, and&#xD;
      the risk factors for developing them. This will assist in designing methods to closely&#xD;
      monitor or prevent them in the future. Certain results of this study could potentially apply&#xD;
      to children with iatrogenic CS, which is much more common due to the widespread use of&#xD;
      pharmacologic doses of glucocorticoids in malignancies, autoimmune and atopic disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will consist of patients that were previously successfully treated for&#xD;
      CD before the age of 21 years. We aim to identify these patients through review of our&#xD;
      current protocol 97-CH-0076 on &quot;Clinical and genetic investigation of pituitary and&#xD;
      hypothalamic tumors&quot;, which has been recruiting patients since 1997. We will also accept&#xD;
      patients who have been diagnosed and successfully treated for pediatric CD at outside&#xD;
      institutions after reviewing the medical records and confirming their diagnosis. The patients&#xD;
      must not be hypercortisolemic at the time of their recruitment. Family members (any age) of&#xD;
      patients with a family history of pituitary tumors and who will agree to participate in the&#xD;
      DNA/linkage analysis study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will evaluate patients at specific intervals after cure at 5 (+/-1), 10 (+/-1), 15 (+/-1)&#xD;
      and 20 (+/-1) years after documented resolution of hypercortisolemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include an online survey offered to all patients, as well as an on-site short&#xD;
      visit for those willing to travel to NIH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The online survey will include questionnaires on assessment of various aspects of health:&#xD;
      Current medical diagnoses, Medication use, History of endocrine disorders, Fertility, Quality&#xD;
      of life, Behavioral and emotional symptomology, and Socioeconomic and Demographic&#xD;
      information. The survey will be developed and distributed with the help of CTDB and will be&#xD;
      sent with secure email to all the patients and/or their parents (for patients who are &lt;18yo&#xD;
      at the time of evaluation) after consent and eligibility have been confirmed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The short on-site visit at NIH will be offered to all the patients willing to travel. Blood&#xD;
      tests, imaging studies (MRI of the carotids, MRI pituitary/brain, DXA scan), and&#xD;
      neurocognitive screening and patient reported outcome questionnaires will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure of the study is the difference of the Body Mass Index (BMI)&#xD;
      z-score of the patients previously treated for pediatric CD compared to the general&#xD;
      population, as calculated by data derived from the NHANES study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcomes will be to describe the prevalence of other endocrine and&#xD;
      non-endocrine abnormalities after successful treatment of CD in childhood, including: growth&#xD;
      hormone, thyroid, gonadal, adrenal function; bone mineral density; glucose metabolism; lipid&#xD;
      profile; cardiovascular abnormalities; immunologic changes; coagulation function; psychiatric&#xD;
      diseases, behavioral symptomology; neurocognitive function; and quality of life.&#xD;
