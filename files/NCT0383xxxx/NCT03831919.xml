    <textblock>
      Many people using computers or digital devices (e.g., smartphones or tablets) experience&#xD;
      eyestrain and this has been called Computer Vision Syndrome (CVS) or Digital Eye Strain.&#xD;
      Spectacle lens manufacturers have designed products to alleviate the symptoms of CVS. One&#xD;
      such product, designed by Hoya (SYNC III), aims to do this by providing accommodative&#xD;
      support. The present study is a parallel group double-masked RCT of people with CVS. One&#xD;
      group will receive Hoya SYNC III lenses and the other (control) group single vision (SV)&#xD;
      lenses. The main aims are to evaluate whether:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. binocular vision and accommodative functions at baseline can predict participants who&#xD;
           benefit from SYNC III design lenses;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the wearing of SYNC III design lenses is associated with any changes in binocular and&#xD;
           accommodative functions at 6 months of follow-up;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. the wearing of lenses with accommodative support reduce the symptoms of computer vision&#xD;
           syndrome at 3 and 6 months of follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be examined three times: at baseline and three and six months after&#xD;
      receiving their lenses. The group who receive control lenses will be provided with SYNC III&#xD;
      lenses at the end of the six month trial for a brief one week follow-up evaluation.&#xD;

      Background Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of the research are to use a parallel group randomised controlled trial to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate whether binocular vision and accommodative functions at baseline can predict&#xD;
           any participants who benefit from SYNC III design lenses;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate whether the wearing of SYNC III design lenses is associated with any changes in&#xD;
           binocular and accommodative functions at 6 months of follow-up;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluate whether the wearing of lenses with accommodative support may reduce the&#xD;
           symptoms of computer vision syndrome at 3 and 6 months of follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Design The research is a double-masked randomised controlled trial. Participants will&#xD;
      be randomly allocated to two groups, one of whom wears SYNC III design lenses and the other&#xD;
      who will wear SV control lenses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research involves thirty participants (15 wearing SYNC III design and 15 with SV) who&#xD;
      will be seen at the Institute of Optometry, London; and 60 participants (30 wearing SYNC III&#xD;
      design and 30 with SV) seen at the University of Alicante.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure The research has received approval from the REC of the Institute of Optometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants will be sought from workplaces and free advertisements in London.&#xD;
      Potential participants will initially be contacted by telephone or email to see if they meet&#xD;
      the entry criteria. Those who do will be invited to complete the CVS-Q and return this to the&#xD;
      researcher to determine if they meet selection criterion described later. Those that do will&#xD;
      be invited to participate in the research and will be sent full information and a consent&#xD;
      form and given the opportunity to have any questions answered. For those that wish to&#xD;
      proceed, an appointment will be arranged for the baseline assessment and they will be asked&#xD;
      to bring their consent form to that appointment, as well as any optical spectacles that they&#xD;
      usually wear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The baseline assessment will start with the consent process and attendees will be given the&#xD;
      opportunity of having any further questions answered before they sign the consent form. The&#xD;
      baseline assessment will only proceed if participants sign the consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the baseline assessment, participants will have already completed and returned the&#xD;
      CVS-Q. The researcher will check the response with the participant and record the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the baseline assessment in the unlikely event that any pathology is detected that&#xD;
      requires medical attention then the participant will be referred according to local protocols&#xD;
      and excluded from the research study (a note of the number of participants, if any, excluded&#xD;
      in this way will be kept). All participants who are not excluded because of pathology will be&#xD;
      allocated a research ID number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hoya will supply the research centres with sample spectacle frames. At the end of the&#xD;
      baseline assessment, participants will choose a frame that they are happy to wear and which&#xD;
      the researcher considers fits properly. The fitting parameters will be measured with the Hoya&#xD;
      VisuReal instrument, which will be provided by Hoya.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant ID number, new spectacle prescription, frame choice, and fitting parameters&#xD;
      will be sent to BE. BE will keep a confidential table of pre-determined (using a random&#xD;
      number generator) random allocation codes which will determine whether, for example,&#xD;
      participant 01 will receive the SYNC III design lenses or SV control lenses (there is a&#xD;
      random 50:50 chance of each intervention for each participant). BE will add this information&#xD;
      to the other information he receives from the research centre and will send this to Hoya Lens&#xD;
      Iberia in Madrid who will manufacture the spectacles for each participant and return these to&#xD;
      the research teams. There will be no markings on the lenses and the research centres will not&#xD;
      investigate the lenses to see if they are SYNC III design or SV. The research centres will&#xD;
      arrange an appointment for the participant to collect the spectacles and will arrange&#xD;
      follow-up appointments after approximately three and six months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the collection appointment the fit of the spectacles will be checked and adjusted if&#xD;
      required. The distance and near visual acuities will be checked to ensure they are as&#xD;
      expected. The participant will be instructed to wear the spectacles for all work with digital&#xD;
      devices and to contact the local research team if there is any difficulty complying with this&#xD;
      instruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately once a month a member of the local research team will telephone or email each&#xD;
      participant to remind them to wear their spectacles, and to remind them of the date of their&#xD;
      next appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the three months and six months follow up appointments the tests in Table 2 will be&#xD;
      repeated (except for ophthalmoscopy and biomicroscopy). For all these tests (except ocular&#xD;
      motility), the participant will wear the same refractive correction as worn at the baseline&#xD;
      assessment. This is to facilitate the detection of any changes from the baseline&#xD;
      accommodative and binocular function that may be attributable to wearing SYNC III design&#xD;
      lenses. When the participant completes the CVS-Q, they will be asked to do so considering the&#xD;
      symptoms they have experienced (if any) with the research spectacles they have been wearing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the final appointment (after six months of wear), after all the tests have been&#xD;
      completed, the researcher will inspect the lenses in the research spectacles to see if they&#xD;
      are SYNC III design or SV. They will inform the participant and, if they have been wearing&#xD;
      SYNC III design, the participant will be allowed to keep the spectacles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who have been wearing control SV lenses will be offered SYNC III design lenses&#xD;
      (this will be made clear in the study information that is given to potential participants&#xD;
      before recruitment, to encourage participation). These SYNC III design lenses will be sent to&#xD;
      participants (in identical frames but with a white mark on the inside of the right side)&#xD;
      after the six months appointment, via the research team. Once these have been worn for one&#xD;
      week, the researcher will telephone the participant to explore their experience with these&#xD;
      lenses compared with the SV control lenses. Participants will be asked, if they could keep&#xD;
      only one pair, whether they would prefer the SYNC III design or the SV controls. They will,&#xD;
      however, be permitted to keep both pairs. It is considered that allowing these participants&#xD;
      to keep two pairs of frames will be a worthwhile gesture to thank participants who have worn&#xD;
      SV lenses for six months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It should be noted that this is not a formal cross-over trial, but rather the participants&#xD;
      who received SV lenses throughout the main trial will receive SYNC III spectacles for just&#xD;
      one week. A full cross-over trial is considered to be impractical because the six months&#xD;
      period with each intervention (which is necessary to determine any effect of SYNC III design&#xD;
      on accommodation) would make a full cross-over trial prohibitively lengthy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Details Interventions SYNC III accommodative support lenses are manufactured by Hoya with&#xD;
      three accommodative support &quot;boost&quot; powers, +0.57, +0.95, +1.32. A sister company, Seiko,&#xD;
      also use the SYNC III design but with different accommodative support powers, including&#xD;
      +0.75. A recent research study compared accommodative support from +0.50, +0.75, and +1.25&#xD;
      and found +0.75 to be the preferred option for most participants. Therefore, a SYNC III&#xD;
      design with +0.75 accommodative support will be used in the present research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control lenses will be standard Hoya single vision aspheric lenses. Both the experimental&#xD;
      and control lenses will be made from 1.6 refractive index plastic lenses with a standard&#xD;
      anti-reflection coating, and neither will have blue-blocking coatings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Attrition The study will follow an &quot;intention to treat&quot; principle. It is considered&#xD;
      inevitable that some participants will drop out during the trial, and no new participants&#xD;
      will be started in their place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. An Excel spreadsheet will be developed for recording results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Data will be entered in the Excel spreadsheet and analysed using Excel and SPSS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Each variable (see Table 2) will be tested using the Shapiro-Wilk test for normality and&#xD;
           parametric and non-parametric statistics will be used as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. ANOVA will be used to determine whether the CVS-Q scores at three and six months differ&#xD;
           from those at baseline and to test the effect of the intervention worn.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Similarly, ANOVA will be used to determine whether there is any change on the&#xD;
           accommodative or binocular vision variables with each intervention after three and six&#xD;
           months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Multivariate analysis will be carried out to evaluate the association between variables&#xD;
           and control the confounding factors&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dissemination Regardless of the outcome, the results of the study will be submitted for&#xD;
      publication in a peer-reviewed journal. The work will also be available for presentation at&#xD;
      the Hoya International/KOL meeting and may also be submitted for presentation at scientific&#xD;
      and clinical conferences, with the agreement of all the researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations The research will conform to the tenets of the Declaration of&#xD;
      Helsinki. Personal data will only be used to contact participants and will be stored on a&#xD;
      separate password protected spreadsheet to the research data. This will be stored securely at&#xD;
      the IoO and at the University of Alicante.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will only start the trial once they have signed a consent form. Participants&#xD;
      will be free to withdraw at any time. If they do withdraw then they will be invited to give a&#xD;
      reason, but it will be made clear that they do not have to give a reason. If they withdraw&#xD;
      they will be entitled to keep any spectacles that have been supplied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant information sheet will make clear to participants that they will not be&#xD;
      receiving an NHS sight test or optical prescription. At the end of the research, upon request&#xD;
      the participant will be given a written copy of the specification of the spectacles they have&#xD;
      worn in the research to show to their optometrist. Participants will be told that the&#xD;
      research does not replace the need for regular eyecare with a community optometrist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research, data entry, analyses, and writing-up will be carried out independently of Hoya.&#xD;
      The work will be disseminated, as outlined above, regardless of the outcome. Publications and&#xD;
      presentations will acknowledge the funding support but will make it clear that the research&#xD;
      and dissemination was carried out independently of Hoya who will have no say in the content&#xD;
      of publications.&#xD;
