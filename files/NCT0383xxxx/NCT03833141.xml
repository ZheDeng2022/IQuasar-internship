  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will generate patient reported outcomes (PROs) associated with the use of&#xD;
      benralizumab as treatment for severe eosinophilic asthma.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Benralizumab was launched in 2018 following regulatory approval in Canada and is now widely&#xD;
      available for Canadian patients with severe eosinophilic asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is an observational cohort study of patient reported outcomes (PROs) within&#xD;
      real-world settings for participants who are prescribed benralizumab for treatment of&#xD;
      uncontrolled severe eosinophilic asthma. Patients will be recruited in select clinics across&#xD;
      Canada.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survey data for each participant in the study will be obtained at the following time-points:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline (Week 0)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Short-term follow up: 1-, 2-, 4-, and 8-weeks after baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Long-term follow-up: 24- and 56-weeks after baseline&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of at least 0.5 units in ACQ-6 after initiation of benralizumab</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to week 56 (from 1st dose of benralizumab)</time_frame>
    <description>ACQ-6 is able to identify the adequacy of asthma control in individual patients.&#xD;
Data will be presented as the proportion of patients achieving a change of at least 0.5 units following initiation of therapy.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of exacerbations</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to week 56 (from first dose of benralizumab)</time_frame>
    <description>The start of an exacerbation is defined as the start-date of systemic corticosteroids or start-date of a temporary increase in a stable oral corticosteroid background dose, or start-date of a hospital admission, whichever occurs earlier.&#xD;
Data will be presented as an annualized exacerbation rate.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in concomitant medications</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to week 56 (from first dose of benralizumab)</time_frame>
    <description>Change in concomitant medications (i.e. oral corticosteroid usage) will be measured.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of participants with Serious Adverse Events and hospitalizations</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to week 56 (from first dose of benralizumab)</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of safety and tolerability through measuring the overall change in number of serious adverse events and hospitalizations.&#xD;
Data will be presented as the proportion of patients experiencing serious adverse events and hospitalizations.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire, Symptoms (AQLQ(S)+12)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to week 56 (from first dose of benralizumab)</time_frame>
    <description>The AQLQ(S)+12 is a questionnaire that measures the health-related quality of life experienced by asthma patients.&#xD;
The questionnaire comprises 4 separate domains (symptoms, activity limitations, emotional function, and environmental stimuli).&#xD;
Patients are asked to recall their experiences during the previous 2 weeks and to score each of the questions on a 7-point scale ranging from 7 (no impairment) to 1 (severe impairment). The overall score is calculated as the mean response to all questions, and is presented as a score from 1 to 7, with lower overall scores indicating increasing impairement.&#xD;
The 4 individual domain scores (symptoms, activity limitations, emotional function, and environmental stimuli) are the means of the responses to the questions in each of the domains.&#xD;
Individual AQLQ(s)+12 Total or domain score changes of ≥0.5 are considered clinically meaningful.&#xD;
Data will be presented as a mean score and change from baseline with a measure of dispersion.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health care resource utilization</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to week 56 (from first dose of benralizumab)</time_frame>
    <description>Health Care Resource Utilization (HCRU) will be measured through the overall change in the number of hospitalization visits, visits to the emergency department, and presenteeism/absenteeism from school/work.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>EuroQol 5 Dimension, 5 Level (EQ-5D-5L)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to week 56 (from first dose of benralizumab)</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L consists of 2 pages: the EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS).&#xD;
The measurement of the EQ-5D-5L health states, defined by the EQ-5D-5L descriptive system, may be converted into a single index value. The index values, presented in country specific value sets, are a major feature of the EQ-5D instrument, facilitating the calculation of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) that are used to inform economic evaluations of health care interventions.&#xD;
Index values are presented on a continuum between 0 and 1, with values approaching 1 indicating increasing quality of life (utility).&#xD;
Data will be presented as mean score as well as a change from baseline score with a measure of dispersion.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM-9)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to week 56 (from first dose of benralizumab)</time_frame>
    <description>The TSQM-9 treatment satisfaction questionnaire is a measure of Effectiveness, Side effects, Convenience, and Global Satisfaction. The scores range from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating greater satisfaction.&#xD;
Data will be presented as a mean score with a change from baseline calculation including a measure of dispersion.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to week 56 (from first dose of benralizumab)</time_frame>
    <description>The self-reported measure Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) reflects a patient's belief about the efficacy of treatment.&#xD;
PGIC is a 7 point scale depicting a patient's rating of overall improvement.&#xD;
Patients rate their change as &quot;very much improved,&quot; &quot;much improved,&quot; &quot;minimally improved,&quot; &quot;no change,&quot; &quot;minimally worse,&quot; &quot;much worse,&quot; or &quot;very much worse.&quot;&#xD;
Data will be presented as a mean score with a change from baseline calculation including a measure of dispersion.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGI-S)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to week 56 (from first dose of benralizumab)</time_frame>
    <description>PGI-S is a 1-item questionnaire designed to assess patient's impression of disease severity. The PGI-S item asks the participant to best describe how their asthma symptoms are now (&quot;Check the one number that best describes how your asthma symptoms are now&quot;) on a 4-point scale scored as: &quot;normal&quot; (1), &quot;mild&quot; (2), &quot;moderate&quot; (3), or &quot;severe&quot; (4) .&#xD;
