    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Following stem cell transplantation, a major risk is graft-versus-host disease&#xD;
      (GVHD). This occurs when donor immune cells that have been infused recognise the host's cells&#xD;
      as 'foreign' and attack these cells. Prevention of GVHD relies upon depletion of donor immune&#xD;
      T cells or drugs that block T cell function. However, these methods also increase the risk of&#xD;
      life threatening infection. There is an important unmet need for better means of accelerating&#xD;
      immune recovery following stem cell transplantation while avoiding GVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-clinical studies have shown that infusion of donor CD62L- effector memory T cells (Tem)&#xD;
      into the host improve immune recovery after allo-Stem Cell Transplant but do not cause GVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase I dose escalation trial aims to determine the feasibility and safety of&#xD;
      transfer of donor Tem following allogeneic stem cell transplantation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phase I study using a Bayesian Time-to-Event Continual Reassessment Method (CRM) to determine&#xD;
      safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of CD62L- Tem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients and HLA-identical sibling donors will be registered prior to stem cell&#xD;
      transplant (SCT). Donors will undergo an additional steady state apheresis for the collection&#xD;
      of T cells between day -14 and day +24 of the allo-SCT according to logistics. Selection of&#xD;
      Tem at the required dose will be performed at UCL Centre for Cell, Gene and Tissue&#xD;
      Therapeutics (CCGTT) before distribution of the cryopreserved cells to the trial centre.&#xD;
      Doses of Tem selected and infused will be: 1x10^5, 3x10^5, 1x10^6 or 3x10^6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Donor Tem will be infused on day 24-32 following allo-SCT. Patients will be followed-up for&#xD;
      12 months with specific evaluation points just prior to Tem infusion and at 3, 6, 9 and 12&#xD;
      months following allo-SCT.&#xD;
