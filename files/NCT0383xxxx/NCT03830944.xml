      VIABILITY study aims to investigate the link between systemic inflammation, pancoronary&#xD;
      plaque vulnerability (referring to the plaque vulnerability within the entire coronary tree),&#xD;
      myocardial viability and ventricular remodeling in patients who had suffered a recent&#xD;
      ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction (STEMI). The level of systemic inflammation&#xD;
      in the acute phase of the myocardial infarction and at 1 month will be assessed on the basis&#xD;
      of serum levels of inflammatory biomarkers (hsCRP, matrix metalloproteinases, interleukin-6).&#xD;
      Pancoronary plaque vulnerability will be assessed: (1) in the acute phase of the infarction,&#xD;
      based on serum biomarkers known to be associated with increased plaque vulnerability, such as&#xD;
      adhesion molecules (V-CAM or I-CAM) determined from the blood samples collected in the first&#xD;
      day after STEMI; (2) at 1 month after infarction, based on computed tomographic angiography&#xD;
      analysis of vulnerability features present in all coronary plaques. Myocardial viability and&#xD;
      remodeling will be assessed based on: (1) 3D speckle tracking echocardiography associated&#xD;
      with dobutamine infusion; (2) MRI imaging associated with complex post-processing techniques&#xD;
      for mapping myocardial fibrosis and scar at the level of left atrium and left ventricle. At&#xD;
      the same time, CT imaging features associated with systemic and local inflammation, such as&#xD;
      global epicardial fat or local pericoronary epicardial fat will be quantified in order to&#xD;
      investigate the impact of inflammatory-mediated plaque vulnerability on the extent of&#xD;
      myocardial damage in acute myocardial infarction. All these parameters will be investigated&#xD;
      in patients with successful primary revascularization performed in a timely manner for&#xD;
      ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction, who will be divided into 2 groups: group 1&#xD;
      - patients who present persistence of an augmented inflammatory status defined as serum&#xD;
      levels of hsCRP&gt;3.0 mg/dl at discharge from the hospital or at 7 days postinfarction&#xD;
      (whichever comes first), and group 2 - patients with no persistence of augmented inflammatory&#xD;
      status (hsCRP&lt;3.0 mg/dl).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of the study will be represented by the rate of post-infarction heart&#xD;
      failure development, defined as the rate of re-admission in the hospital for heart failure or&#xD;
      by a significant decrease in the ejection fraction (&lt;45%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary endpoints of the study will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  rate of re-hospitalization&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  rate of repeated revascularization&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  rate of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE rate, including cardiovascular death&#xD;
           or stroke)&#xD;

      Patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) who survive the acute event, very often&#xD;
      present a significant deterioration of their clinical status with progression towards heart&#xD;
      failure, which is directly linked to the extent of myocardial injury and the remodeling&#xD;
      process starting immediately after infarction. The major aim of the urgent revascularization&#xD;
      in STEMI is to save myocardial tissue from death and necrosis, in order to recover viable&#xD;
      myocardium. It is well-known that one of the major factors that trigger an AMI is the&#xD;
      systemic inflammation, which has a direct influence on coronary plaque vulnerability. At the&#xD;
      same time, 20% of patients surviving an AMI present a recurrent cardiovascular event in the&#xD;
      following 12 months, as a result of increased systemic inflammation triggered by the&#xD;
      infarction, which leads to vulnerabilization of other atheromatous plaques from all the&#xD;
      circulatory system in the post-infarction period. While the role of inflammation in acute&#xD;
      coronary events is well established, the impact of inflammatory-mediated vulnerability of&#xD;
      coronary plaques from the entire coronary tree on the extension of ventricular remodeling and&#xD;
      scaring has not been elucidated so far.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a clinical prospective, descriptive, single-center study which will be carried out in&#xD;
      the University of Medicine, Pharmacy, Science and Technology Tîrgu Mures, Romania, in&#xD;
      collaboration with two clinical sites: Center of Advanced Research in Multimodal Cardiac&#xD;
      Imaging Cardio Med Tîrgu Mures, Romania and County Clinical Emergency Hospital Tîrgu Mures,&#xD;
      Romania. The duration of the study is 2 years which includes the initial screening and the&#xD;
      follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll 100 subjects with STEMI who underwent successful revascularization of&#xD;
      the culprit lesion in the first 12 hours after the onset of symptoms. Imaging biomarkers and&#xD;
      laboratory analyses such as: high sensitive C Reactive Protein (hsCRP), matrix&#xD;
      metalloproteinases (MMP), interleukin-6 (IL6) and N-Terminal Pro-B-Type Natriuretic Peptide&#xD;
      (NT pro-BNP) will be determined in the first 24 hours after the index hospitalization. At 1&#xD;
      month postinfarction all patients will undergo Dobutamine stress test associated with speckle&#xD;
      tracking echocardiography for evaluation of myocardial function and viability, CMR for&#xD;
      assessment of myocardial scar, function and remodeling, and Multislice Angio CT for&#xD;
      assessment of pancoronary vulnerability, by complex characterization of vulnerability&#xD;
      features in all the coronary plaques present in the coronary tree. All these parameters will&#xD;
      be investigated in patients with successful primary percutaneous coronary revascularization,&#xD;
      who will be divided into 2 groups: group 1 -patients with persistent elevation of systemic&#xD;
      inflammatory biomarkers at discharge from the hospital or at day 7 (whichever comes first)&#xD;
      (inflammation+ group); and group 2 - patients with no persistent elevation of systemic&#xD;
      inflammatory biomarkers at discharge from the hospital or at day 7 (whichever comes first)&#xD;
      (inflammation- group). In all patients, the following biomarkers will be determined: serum&#xD;
      levels of inflammatory biomarkers, adhesion molecules and NT-proBNP at 24 hours and 7 days&#xD;
      post procedure, the amount of myocardial fibrosis and scar in the left ventricle at 1 month,&#xD;
      the degree of ventricular remodeling and myocardial perfusion at 1 month and the amount of&#xD;
      epicardial fat surrounding the heart and the plaques. The study will be conducted over a&#xD;
      period of 2 years, in which patients will be examined at baseline, and will be followed-up&#xD;
      for MACE incidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will sign an informed written consent and will be checked for the exclusion&#xD;
      criteria prior to enrollment.&#xD;
