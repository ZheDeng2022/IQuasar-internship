  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is an endemic malignancy in Southern China, Hong Kong, Taiwan,&#xD;
      Singapore and Malaysia. It is highly associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Radiation&#xD;
      therapy alone is indicated for early stage I to II diseases while concurrent chemoradiation&#xD;
      is required for more advanced stage III to IVB diseases. Intensity-modulated radiation&#xD;
      therapy (IMRT) is the standard radiation technique for NPC, in virtue of its superior target&#xD;
      coverage and dose sparing to adjacent critical organs-at-risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma EBV DNA and other novel plasma biomarkers have been extensively investigated in NPC.&#xD;
      Previous studies have proven their predictive and prognostic values in NPC diagnosis,&#xD;
      surveillance and survival outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators would like to investigate the roles of plasma biomarkers including plasma EBV&#xD;
      DNA on treatment response evaluation, survival and prognosis on NPC, in the modern era of&#xD;
      precision radiation therapy. This will help provide important information on refining on the&#xD;
      current edition of AJCC/UICC staging classification.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with histologically confirmed previously untreated NPC are be recruited to join tis&#xD;
      study. The study has obtained approval from local institutional review board.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After written informed consent, baseline investigations including blood tests for routine&#xD;
      hematology, biochemistry and plasma EBV DNA will be taken. Only 3ml of EDTA blood will be&#xD;
      taken for plasma EBV DNA and other potential biomarkers. Patients will also undergo baseline&#xD;
      imaging investigations including positron-emission tomography with integrated computed&#xD;
      tomography (PET-CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head and neck regions. An&#xD;
      routine nasoendoscopy and nasopharyngeal biopsies will be obtained to confirm and delineate&#xD;
      the mucosal extent of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If confirmed non-metastatic, patients will be treated with IMRT using 7-9 radiation beams. A&#xD;
      total dose of 70Gy in 33-35 fractions over 6.5 to 7 weeks will be given. For advanced stage&#xD;
      III to IVB diseases, concurrent chemoradiation using cisplatin 100mg/m2 on Day 1, 22 and 43&#xD;
      of IMRT followed by 3 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin 80mg/m2 on Day 1 and&#xD;
      5-FU 1000mg/m2 from Day 1 to Day 4 every 4 weeks for 3 more cycles starting 4 weeks after&#xD;
      completion of IMRT will also be given. Some patients will also receive induction chemotherapy&#xD;
      with cisplatin100mg/m2 on Day 1 and 5-FU 1000mg/m2 on Day 1 to 5, administered every 3 weeks&#xD;
      for 3 cycles before commencement of chemoradiation, at the discretion of treating oncologists&#xD;
      if the primary tumours are close to critical organs e.g. brainstem, optic chiasm or optic&#xD;
      nerves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After treatment patients will undergo nasopharyngeal biopsies, patients will undergo&#xD;
      nasopharyngeal biopsies again at 8 weeks after completion of IMRT to confirm histological&#xD;
      complete local remission. Blood will be taken again on the same day for plasma EBV DNA and&#xD;
      other potential biomarkers. Additional biopsies and salvage local treatment e.g.&#xD;
      brachytherapy, stereotactic or IMRT boost will be offered to patients who have persistent&#xD;
      local disease at 12 weeks after completion of IMRT. If complete local remission is confirmed,&#xD;
      patient will have regular follow up every 3 to 4 months for surveillance and survival&#xD;
      outcomes. Regular imaging with MRI and CT scans every 3 to 4 months will also be arranged as&#xD;
      well. Plasma EBV DNA will be measured at weekly intervals until EBV DNA is undetectable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For those with metastatic diseases, systemic chemotherapy (platinum-based chemotherapy) will&#xD;
      be offered. Blood taking for plasma EBV DNA and other potential biomarkers at baseline before&#xD;
      chemotherapy commencement and then after every 3 cycles will be arranged. Imaging&#xD;
      examinations with CT and MRI scans will be arranged at baseline and then after 3-4 cycles of&#xD;
      chemotherapy for tumour response evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trend of baseline and serial plasma EBV DNA will be monitored prospectively.&#xD;
