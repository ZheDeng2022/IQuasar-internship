  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Implant-based reconstruction is currently the most common choice for mastectomy&#xD;
      reconstruction. Whatever the choice of mastectomy incision, a scar remains on or near the&#xD;
      breast volume. Current techniques involve partial or total coverage of the implant with the&#xD;
      pectoralis major muscle, to prevent exposure or infection. The muscle dissection technique&#xD;
      applied has functional and cosmetic consequences. In this study, an endoscopic approach will&#xD;
      be evaluated. This new surgical technique, using a single-port endoscopic way, will put the&#xD;
      scar is in the axillary area, away from the breast. The hypothesis is that this delocalized&#xD;
      scar potentially reduces the risk of exposure and allows placement of the implant in the&#xD;
      subcutaneous space, with no manipulation of the pectoralis major muscle.&#xD;

      It s a practicability study, evaluating endoscopic approach for prophylactic mastectomy,&#xD;
      using an axillary single port. Classic open surgery conversion rate, operative time,&#xD;
      infectious rate, esthetical outcomes, and functional outcomes will be evaluated.&#xD;

    <description>BREAST-Q© questionnaire Version 2.0 measure the quality of life and satisfaction among patients undergoing breast surgery. This questionnaire includes 6 modules: 1) Augmentation module, 2) Reduction/Mastectomy module, 3) Breast cancer: a) Mastectomy module, b) Reconstruction module, c) Breast reconstruction expectations module, d) Breast conserving therapy module.&#xD;
The conceptual framework of the modules is comprised of following two overarching themes (or domains): 1) Health-related quality of life and 2) Patient satisfaction. 1) Under each of these domains, there are six subthemes; Quality of life: 1) Psychosocial, 2) Physical and 3) Sexual well-being; and Patient satisfaction: 4) Satisfaction with Breasts, 5) Satisfaction with Outcome and 6) Satisfaction with care.&#xD;

The Constant score is mesured between 0 and 100. The higher the score, the fewer problems there are for the patient, 100 is the ideal score.</description>

    <description>Quality of life with an european quality of life scale (EQ-5D-3L). The EQ-5D-3L descriptive system comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 3 levels: no problems, some problems, and extreme problems. Rated level can be coded as a number 1, 2, or 3, which indicates having no problems for 1, having some problems for 2, and having extreme problems for 3. As a result, a person's health status can be defined by a 5-digit number, ranging from 11111 (having no problems in all dimensions) to 33333 (having extreme problems in all dimensions).</description>
