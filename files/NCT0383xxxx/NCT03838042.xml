    <textblock>
      The aim of this trial is to determine preliminary activity of the combination treatment with&#xD;
      nivolumab and entinostat in children and adolescents with high risk&#xD;
      refractory/relapsed/progressive tumors harboring a high mutational load, high PD-L1 mRNA&#xD;
      expression or focal MYC(N) amplification and explore activity in biomarker low tumors (low&#xD;
      mutational load, low PD-L1 mRNA expression and non-MYC(N) amplified).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Compared to adult cancers, most pediatric cancers carry a relatively low mutational burden.&#xD;
      However, a small fraction of pediatric tumors in the INFORM registry cohort display a higher&#xD;
      mutational burden. Truly hypermutated tumors, e.g. in the context of rare cancer&#xD;
      predisposition syndromes, are reported to respond well to immune checkpoint inhibition. In&#xD;
      addition to hypermutation, increased PD-L1 expression is associated with clinical responses&#xD;
      to checkpoint inhibition. Increased PD-L1 mRNA expression is observed in a small fraction of&#xD;
      pediatric patients in the INFORM registry cohort independent from mutational load. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that pediatric tumors with a high mutational burden and/or high PD-L1 expression&#xD;
      will respond to checkpoint inhibition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HDAC inhibition (HDACi) modifies T-cell regulation and can augment response to checkpoint&#xD;
      inhibition by reducing the number of myeloid-derived suppressor cells and creating an&#xD;
      immunogenic tumor microenvironment including induction of MHCI and neo-antigens. In vitro and&#xD;
      in vivo models showed enhanced anti-tumor activity of the combination of checkpoint&#xD;
      inhibition and HDACi compared to either agent alone. This provides a strong rationale to&#xD;
      combine these drug classes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, MYC- or NMYC-driven (referred to as MYC(N)) malignancies like very high-risk&#xD;
      medulloblastomas or very high-risk neuroblastomas still have a dismal outcome. MYC is not&#xD;
      only reported to upregulate PD-L1 and thereby a possible biomarker for checkpoint inhibition&#xD;
      but also very compelling recent preclinical data strongly suggests that HDAC inhibitors are&#xD;
      active against MYC amplified medulloblastoma in vitro and in vivo. In NMYC amplified&#xD;
      neuroblastoma cell lines similar observations were made in vitro. Taken together, our results&#xD;
      suggest that MYC(N)-driven tumors depend on HDAC and we hypothesize that MYC(N) status can&#xD;
      serve as a biomarker for response prediction to a combinatorial treatment of checkpoint&#xD;
      inhibition and HDAC inhibition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pediatric patients aged 6-21 years with refractory/relapsed/progressive high-risk&#xD;
      malignancies with a high mutational load (group A), with high PD-L1 mRNA expression (group&#xD;
      B), with MYC(N) amplification (group C) and with a low mutational load, low PD-L1 mRNA&#xD;
      expression and no MYC(N) amplification (Biomarker low group D) are eligible for this trial.&#xD;
      Phase I determines the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for the combination of the HDACi&#xD;
      entinostat and the checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab for the age groups 6-11 and 12-21 years,&#xD;
      respectively. Phase II investigates activity in 4 groups A, B, C, D. The duration of&#xD;
      treatment is 12 cycles (1 cycle = 28 days), preceded by 1 priming week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, a comprehensive accompanying research program investigates PD biomarkers for&#xD;
      immune checkpoint and HDAC inhibition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical trials investigating the combination of nivolumab and entinostat in children have&#xD;
      not been reported so far.&#xD;

    <description>A dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as any AE according to the definitions and exceptions listed below that is related to the administration of the combination of investigational agents occurring during the priming week and first cycle of combination treatment (first 5 weeks) in phase I of the trial.&#xD;
A study participant will be considered evaluable for a DLT if at least 2 doses of nivolumab and 4 doses of entinostat were administered during the first 5 weeks (5 weeks normally incorporate the priming week and 1 cycle of planned combination treatment).

          -  Major surgery within 21 days of the first dose. Gastrostomy, ventriculo-peritoneal&#xD;
             shunt, endoscopic ventriculostomy, tumor biopsy and insertion of central venous access&#xD;
             devices are not considered major surgery, but for these procedures, a 48 hour interval&#xD;
             must be maintained before the first dose of the investigational drug is administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any anticancer therapy (e.g., chemotherapy, HDACi (including valproic acid), DNA&#xD;
             methyltransferase inhibitors, other immunotherapy, targeted therapy, biological&#xD;
             response modifiers, endocrine anticancer therapy or radiotherapy) within 2 weeks or at&#xD;
             least 5 half- lives (whichever is longer) of study drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Radiologically confirmed radiotherapy induced pseudoprogression in CNS tumors&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Traditional herbal medicines; these therapies are not fully studied and their use may&#xD;
             result in unanticipated drug-drug interactions that may cause or confound the&#xD;
             assessment of toxicity. As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the&#xD;
             patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to&#xD;
             do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new&#xD;
             over-the- counter medicine or herbal product. For information on CYP substrates and&#xD;
             P-gp inhibitors or inducers see section 5.8.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of hypersensitivity to the investigational medicinal product or to any drug&#xD;
             with similar chemical structure or to any excipient present in the pharmaceutical form&#xD;
             (including benzamide) of the investigational medicinal product&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in other ongoing clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or lactating females.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of underlying medical condition (e.g. gastrointestinal disorders or&#xD;
             electrolyte disturbances) that in the opinion of the Investigator or Sponsor could&#xD;
             adversely affect the ability of the subject to comply with or tolerate study&#xD;
             procedures and/or study therapy, or confound the ability to interpret the tolerability&#xD;
             of combined administration of entinostat and nivolumab in treated subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving systemic steroid therapy or any other form of immunosuppressive&#xD;
             therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of study treatment. The use of&#xD;
             physiologic doses of corticosteroids (up to 5 mg/m2/day prednisone equivalent) may be&#xD;
             approved after consultation with the Sponsor. No patient will be allowed to enroll in&#xD;
             this trial more than once.&#xD;

    <ipd_description>The pseudonymized data will be shared for transparency reasons in the context of publications and after publication with other physicians and scientists (national and international academia) to promote and accelerate research on causes and treatment development of oncological diseases.&#xD;
Requests for access to pseudonymized patient data for non-INFORM-related scientific purposes will be reviewed by a Data Access Committee consisting of the INFORM Board, and the participating investigators. A positive statement of the respective ethic committee and a signed data protection commitment are requested. Requests should be addressed to the coordinating investigator Prof. Olaf Witt. Results of scientific research based on the INFORM2 NivEnt data may be used for academic teaching, research and scientific publications or presentations at scientific meetings.</ipd_description>
