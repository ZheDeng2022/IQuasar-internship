  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients in three hospitals in Sweden who will have knee arthroplasty surgery for the first&#xD;
      time are invited to participate in the study, approximately 2000 patients. The fasting&#xD;
      glucose value (fP-glucose) is obtained via a blood sample the day after the knee arthroplasty&#xD;
      surgery. The sample is analyzed and the glucose value obtained is documented and sent to the&#xD;
      Swedish Knee Arthroplasty Register (SKAR). In the SKAR there is information on patient&#xD;
      characteristics, diagnosis, prosthesis, anesthetic form and primary and secondary operations,&#xD;
      etc. The unique personal numbers of the included patients are submitted to the National Board&#xD;
      of Health and Welfare, which matches the cohort with the Patient Register to identify adverse&#xD;
      events, re-admission and death in a year after the surgery. SKAR has carried out several&#xD;
      interactions with the National Board of Health and Welfare, and possesses clinical expertise&#xD;
      as well as registers and biostatistics expertise. Incidence calculation of the proportion&#xD;
      that develops elevated glucose levels after surgery and Cox regression for group comparison&#xD;
      (elevated glucose vs. non-elevated) taking into account factors within groups such as age,&#xD;
      gender, etc. This is a register-based observation study. Since the incidence of elevated&#xD;
      glucose value after a knee prosthesis operation is not known, we are planning for a&#xD;
      representative selection from three major prosthetic clinics in Sweden. Regarding the&#xD;
      secondary purposes, our ability to answer these depends on the presence of elevated glucose&#xD;
      levels. The inclusion start in January 2019 and lasts for one year. Incidence calculations&#xD;
      can be made as soon as all patients are included, but 90-day data from the patient register&#xD;
      can reasonably be completed&#xD;

      Purpose&#xD;
&#xD;
      To reduce the risk of prosthetic joint infection (PJI) after primary knee arthroplasty&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims are to study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the presence of postoperative hyperglycemia after knee arthroplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  if there is an increased risk of wound disturbance&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  if there is an increased risk of PJI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  if there is an increased risk of other complications, re-admissions and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  if postoperative hyperglycemia is more common after general than spinal anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  if patients developing hyperglycemia has longer hospital stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative hyperglycemia is a consequence of the insulin resistance that may occur in&#xD;
      otherwise healthy nondiabetic patients after uncomplicated elective surgery (Thorell et al.&#xD;
      1999). Hyperglycemia has been associated with an increased risk of PJI (Mraovic et al. 2011)&#xD;
      and to be a risk factor in many common postoperative complications (van den Berghe et al.&#xD;
      2001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knee arthroplasty surgery in Sweden has more than doubled since the millennium with more than&#xD;
      14,000 primary knee arthroplasties in 2016. The risk of revision after a primary knee&#xD;
      arthroplasty is the lowest reported in the world (less than 5% after 10 years in total knee&#xD;
      arthroplasty) (SKAR 2017). However during the latest 10 years the risk of revision due to&#xD;
      infection has increased as compared to the previous 10 years. PJI is an uncommon&#xD;
      complication, 1% - 1.5% (SKAR 2017), but devastating for the patient and an expensive&#xD;
      complication for the health care and the society.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During 2009-2013 the Prosthetic Related Infections Shall be Stopped project (PRISS) was&#xD;
      performed in Sweden. The purpose of that project was to half the risk of PJI in knee and hip&#xD;
      arthroplasties by optimizing the routines. All hospitals performing knee and hip arthroplasty&#xD;
      surgery in Sweden participated (www.lof.se). The PRISS project resulted in, among other&#xD;
      things, documents/recommendations including a compilation and evaluation of the best-known&#xD;
      knowledge within four important areas; risk factor and optimizing, prophylactic antibiotics,&#xD;
      follow-up and infection registration and optimal operation room environment. These documents&#xD;
      are updated every second year or in case of new knowledge. One of the issues that the expert&#xD;
      group, within risk factors and optimizing, requested was further research concerning if&#xD;
      screening for hyperglycemia in patients with unknown diabetes has an effect on the risk of&#xD;
      PJI (www.lof.se).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative hyperglycemia has been shown to be relatively common (Pili-Floury et al. 2009,&#xD;
      Jämsen et al. 2015). Pili-Floury et al. (2009) showed that 29/38 patients without a medical&#xD;
      history of diabetes before the surgery became hyperglycemic for the first two days following&#xD;
      arthroplasty surgery. A study from a Finnish hospital found that one fourth (47/191) of the&#xD;
      hip and knee arthroplasty patients included in the study had pre-diabetes (increased fasting&#xD;
      glucose and/or impaired glucose tolerance) and half of these patients (24/47) developed&#xD;
      perioperative hyperglycemia (Jämsen et al. 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prevention and treatment of insulin resistance has been shown to have an effect on morbidity,&#xD;
      mortality, and recovery after surgery (Ljungqvist et al. 2007). It has been suggested that&#xD;
      insulin resistance can be avoided using epidural analgesia, minimally invasive surgical&#xD;
      technique, optimal pain control, and preoperative carbohydrate treatment (Ljungqvist et al.&#xD;
      2007). General anesthesia has become more common in Sweden and was used in 30% of the surgery&#xD;
      during 2016 with large variations between hospitals. Minimal invasive surgery is sometimes&#xD;
      used in uni-compartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) but not in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in&#xD;
      Sweden (SKAR 2017). The hospitals use standardized multi-modal pain control including local&#xD;
      infiltration analgesia (LIA), while the use of preoperative carbohydrate treatment may vary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no general recommendations in Sweden to measure fasting glucose levels and/or HBA1c&#xD;
      either preoperatively or postoperatively in knee arthroplasty patients unless they have&#xD;
      diagnosed diabetes. In a survey from the Swedish Knee Arthroplasty Register (SKAR) to all 74&#xD;
      hospitals in Sweden performing knee arthroplasty surgery 2017, only 5 hospitals routinely&#xD;
      obtained fasting plasma glucose (fP-Glucose). In these hospitals, patients having an elevated&#xD;
      glucose level are submitted to the primary care for further investigation. The number of such&#xD;
      patients is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Work plan&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Study population All patients operated with a primary knee arthroplasty from 1st of&#xD;
           January 2019 to 31st of December 2020 in high volume hospitals will be invited to&#xD;
           participate in the study, approximately 2,000 patients. The operation will be registered&#xD;
           in the SKAR to which all hospitals performing knee arthroplasty surgery in Sweden report&#xD;
           their knee arthroplasties (primaries, revisions and re-operations). The validity of the&#xD;
           register has been considered to be high (coverage 100%, completeness 97%, and response&#xD;
           rate 99%) (SKAR 2017). All variables registered are shown and described in the variable&#xD;
           list (attachment 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Plasma glucose The pre-, per- and postoperative routines at each hospital will be as&#xD;
           usual, except that for a fP-glucose measurement. In the morning the day after surgery,&#xD;
           fP-Glucose will be measured, using the ordinary routine for blood samples at each&#xD;
           hospital. The glucose level in plasma is reported as millimoles per liter (mmol/L).&#xD;
           According to the Nordic Reference Interval Project (NORIP) the reference interval for&#xD;
           venous and capillary fP-Glucose is 4.2-6.3 mmol/L, i.e. slightly different from the&#xD;
           World Health Organization (WHO) reference value which is &lt;6.1 mmol/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The result of the test will be documented on a form (attachment 2) that includes the&#xD;
           patient's personal identification (ID), the date of fP-Glucose measurement, if the&#xD;
           patient has diabetes (type 1 or 2) or not and in case of diabetes what treatment (diet,&#xD;
           tablets, insulin). The form will be sent to the SKAR and entered in a separate file&#xD;
           which can be linked to the SKAR database. Using the SKAR will provide information on the&#xD;
           proportion of patients participating in the study as well as for their follow-up with&#xD;
           respect to further surgeries or complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Prosthetic joint infection Revisions and re-operations due to infection or suspected&#xD;
           infection as well as other causes after primary knee arthroplasty are registered in the&#xD;
           SKAR (attachment 1). Patients treated for infection or suspected infections not&#xD;
           requiring surgery are documented in the department's local infection register at each&#xD;
           hospital respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Other complications, re-admissions and mortality The SKAR has together with the National&#xD;
           Board of Health and Welfare examined the ICD10 and the Nordic Medico-Statistical&#xD;
           Committee codes (NOMESCO, a classification of surgical procedures) that occur in the&#xD;
           National Patient Register (NPR) during admission for, and after knee arthroplasty. This&#xD;
           has resulted in a longer list of codes that may represent adverse events when they occur&#xD;
           during the hospital stay or in readmissions within 90 days and 1 year of surgery (SKAR).&#xD;
           The SKAR will send data on registered patients to the NPR which performs the match. The&#xD;
           NPR will check if they during the hospital stay or within 1 year of the surgery received&#xD;
           ICD10 and/or procedure codes that correspond to the definition of adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Length of hospital stay The length of hospital stay for each patient is obtained from&#xD;
           the electronic record system used by the orthopedic departments at each site.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Statistics The primary aim of this register-based, observational, study is to&#xD;
           investigate how common postoperative hyperglycemia is after knee arthroplasty. The&#xD;
           secondary aim is to investigate if hyperglycemic patients have an increased risk of PJI&#xD;
           or adverse events and if hyperglycemia is more common after general than spinal&#xD;
           anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The proportion of hyperglycemia patients in Sweden is unknown. The study is to be&#xD;
           performed at large arthroplasty units that operate approximately 400-800 knee&#xD;
           arthroplasties/year. Assuming that the proportion of patients with hyperglycemia is&#xD;
           similar to that in the Finnish study, i.e. 25% (Jämsen et al. 2015), the hospitals&#xD;
           together operate 1800 primary knee arthroplasties during one year and that 80% of the&#xD;
           patients accept to participate in the study, would result in 450 patients having&#xD;
           hyperglycemia. This would provide a reasonable material for evaluation of risks&#xD;
           concerning infections and adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Ethics In some hospitals in Sweden, fP-glucose is a routine while in those hospitals&#xD;
           included in the planed study it is not. However in the morning the day after surgery the&#xD;
           hemoglobin value is controlled routinely and performed at the included hospitals. From&#xD;
           the same splinter as hemoglobin is taken in the finger or vein, fP-glucose can be&#xD;
           obtained. The splinter in the finger or vein may be painful and experienced as&#xD;
           unpleasant by the patients instantly but this additional test will not cause any further&#xD;
           discomfort. The patients will be sent written information (attachment 2) about the study&#xD;
           together with the invitation for the preoperative visit at each hospital. At the&#xD;
           preoperative visit the patients has possibility to further questions if requested.&#xD;
           Considering the patients integrity all results will be presented on aggregated level and&#xD;
           the material is relatively large and the risk for individual identification may be seen&#xD;
           as negligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importance&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, we have no knowledge on the prevalence of postoperative hyperglycemia after knee&#xD;
      arthroplasty in patients without diagnosed diabetes or its effect on outcome. Prosthetic&#xD;
      joint infection is a devastating complication for the patients as well as it is costly for&#xD;
      the health care and the society. Should postoperative hyperglycemia be a risk factor in the&#xD;
      development of PJI it may be a modifiable risk factor by prevention and/or treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By including patients having a primary knee arthroplasty we will gain knowledge on the&#xD;
      proportion of patients without diagnosed diabetes having elevated postoperative glucose&#xD;
      values and to evaluate if such patients run an increased risk of PJI or other adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further, general anesthesia during arthroplasty surgery has become more popular in Sweden in&#xD;
      recent years. However, it has been suggested that general anesthesia may be increase the risk&#xD;
      for hyperglycemia after surgery (Ljungqvist et al. 2007). Thus, this study may help us find&#xD;
      out if this is the case or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dependent on the findings of the study, a continuation may be needed in order to evaluate the&#xD;
      possible benefit of a general preoperative screening in arthroplasty patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional/Safety&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with elevated postoperative fP-Glucose level will be followed-up by the primary&#xD;
      care. In case of fP-Glucose levels associated with diabetes the routines of the department&#xD;
      will be followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time-frame The collection of data will start January 1st 2019 if all permissions are granted&#xD;
      and continue until December 31st 19. During 2019-2020 the patients will be followed in the&#xD;
      SKAR as well in medical journals and local infection registers. When the last patient is&#xD;
      included we may have the possibility to present the frequency of hyperglycemia after knee&#xD;
      arthroplasty surgery in the hospitals included. The data from the NPR for patients&#xD;
      participating in the study will probably not be ready until the spring 2020. In the summer&#xD;
      2020 we may have data from the Patient register for complications, readmission and death&#xD;
      during the first 90 day after surgery and be able to present a short follow-up. During the&#xD;
      spring 2021 we may have the 1 year follow-up from the NPR.&#xD;
