    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to explore the impact of early palliative care on quality of life in&#xD;
      patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. The secondary objectives are to explore the impact&#xD;
      of early palliative care on symptom management, depression, anxiety and survival in patients&#xD;
      with advanced pancreatic cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective case-crossover study of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer (APC)&#xD;
      at CancerCare Manitoba (CCMB) with early palliative care (PALC) plus standard oncologic care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of this study is quality of life (QOL) at week 16, measured by the&#xD;
      Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - hepatobiliary (FACT-Hep). FACT-hep is a 45-item&#xD;
      tool, which measures physical, emotional, social and functional well-being, and has been&#xD;
      validated in a general population with hepatobiliary cancers, including metastatic pancreatic&#xD;
      cancer. FACT-Hep has strong psychometric properties, and is a reliable, comprehensive and&#xD;
      well-validated scale for use in patients with gastrointestinal cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints will include: (1) symptom control at 16 weeks as measured by the revised&#xD;
      Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS-r), (a widely used and validated tool to assess&#xD;
      symptom intensity, which is routinely completed by patients at all CCMB visits); (2)&#xD;
      depression and anxiety at 16 weeks using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS),&#xD;
      (a-14 item scale which can be used in the outpatient setting to screen for anxiety and&#xD;
      depression within the previous week) and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), (a&#xD;
      sensitive (88%) and specific (88%) 9-question tool which incorporates diagnostic criteria for&#xD;
      major depression); and overall survival measured from date of registration to death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment to the study will occur in a clinic staffed by medical oncologists with expertise&#xD;
      in gastrointestinal cancers, as this is the first point of entry into the CCMB system for&#xD;
      patients with APC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early PALC will consist of referral to PALC at the time of study enrollment. Patients will&#xD;
      undergo an initial consultation by the PALC team within two weeks of registration. Patients&#xD;
      enrolled in the study who are also receiving chemotherapy must have their initial PALC&#xD;
      consultation before receiving cycle 2 of chemotherapy. Baseline QoL questionnaires may be&#xD;
      completed any time between registration and the first PALC consultation. The PALC team will&#xD;
      be led by a physician with subspecialty training in PALC and an advanced practice nurse, with&#xD;
      the ability to involve other members of the team (dietician, pharmacist, social worker,&#xD;
      psychologist, psychiatrist, spiritual care, home care) as needed. The initial consultation by&#xD;
      the PALC team will consist of assessments as per guidelines set by the Canadian Hospice&#xD;
      Palliative Care Association. Patients will be followed by the PALC team at least every 2&#xD;
      weeks for the first month, then every 4 weeks until week 16, then at the discretion of the&#xD;
      PALC team thereafter. Follow-up PALC visits will occur in person or via telehealth&#xD;
      videoconference. A more intensive follow up regimen will occur early on, with a goal of&#xD;
      achieving symptom control, as APC related symptoms can result in emergency room visits and&#xD;
      hospitalizations. Patients will also receive regular oncologic follow up as directed by their&#xD;
      oncologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will complete the FACT-hep, ESAS-r, HADS and PHQ-9 at baseline and every 4 weeks&#xD;
      until week 16. The data collected at these time points will provide a sense of the trajectory&#xD;
      of the patient experience and provide insights into the timing of interventions to improve&#xD;
      management of pain, symptoms, anxiety and depression in the future. Measuring QOL at these&#xD;
      various time points may also be useful in case we experience unexpected loss to follow up at&#xD;
      weeks 16, as it would provide data at intermediate time points for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Completion of QOL questionnaires will take patients approximately 15-20 minutes (10-15&#xD;
      minutes for FACT-hep), 1-2 minutes for ESAS, 2-3 minutes for HADS, and 1-2 minutes for&#xD;
      PHQ-9). Questionnaires will be completed in the outpatient clinic, at least 7 days after&#xD;
      receiving any chemotherapy to avoid conflation from chemotherapy side effects. All&#xD;
      questionnaires will be collected by a study coordinator, and the study coordinator will be&#xD;
      available to assist patients with questionnaire paperwork as needed. If a patient does not&#xD;
      have an oncology appointment, they may receive the questionnaires and a stamped return&#xD;
      envelope in the mail. If the questionnaires are not returned within 2 weeks, the study&#xD;
      coordinator will contact the patient via phone as a reminder. If necessary, the study&#xD;
      coordinator can complete these in an interview-style format over the telephone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient and treatment characteristics will be captured at baseline, including: age, sex,&#xD;
      education level, height, weight, primary language spoken, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group&#xD;
      (ECOG) performance status, comorbid illnesses (hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, coronary&#xD;
      artery disease, cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic attack, psychiatric illness,&#xD;
      other cancers), medications (prescribed, over the counter, alternative/complementary), use of&#xD;
      opioids for cancer related pain, weight loss, clinical stage (locally advanced,&#xD;
      unresectable/metastatic), site of primary tumour in pancreas (head or neck/body/tail), CA&#xD;
      19-9 (normal/elevated). Emergency room visits and hospitalizations while on study will be&#xD;
      captured. This data will be used to describe the study cohort. Data will be entered and&#xD;
      maintained in REDCap on the University of Manitoba's secure research environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note: During the time of the COVID-19 response, patients are assessed over the phone by the&#xD;
      advanced practice nurse two days before their scheduled appointment to determine if in-person&#xD;
      visits are necessary. If in-person visits are necessary, follow up palliative care visits&#xD;
      will be done in clinic with only one support person allowed per patient and clinic visit time&#xD;
      limited to minimize any potential exposure time. In in-person visits not necessary, the&#xD;
      follow up palliative care visits are conducted over the phone until COVID-19 precautions are&#xD;
      lifted.&#xD;

    <description>For the primary endpoint, we will use a generalized linear model to test for a statistically significant change score between baseline and 16 weeks. We will assume a normal distribution for the change scores. Model fit will be assessed via a visual assessment of residuals and the ratio of the model deviance to its degrees of freedom.</description>
