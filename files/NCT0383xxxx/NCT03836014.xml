  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incorporation of proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory drugs into the standard of&#xD;
      care has improved the outcome for patients with multiple myeloma (MM) over the past 10 years.&#xD;
      However, most patients (&gt;85%) still eventually relapse around 3-4 years after diagnosis, and&#xD;
      ultimately die of their disease, despite salvage therapies. Relapse can occur even when&#xD;
      complete remission is achieved after first-line therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, daratumumab (Dara) is approved by the american FDA and EMA in combination with&#xD;
      lenalidomide (Len) and dexamethasone (Dex) or bortezomib and Dex for the treatment of MM&#xD;
      patients who have received at least one prior therapy. Therefore, the Dara-Len-Dex&#xD;
      combination is likely to become the most widely used standard of care regimen for MM at the&#xD;
      time of first relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, although approval of the latter combination is meant for until disease progression&#xD;
      (PD) (&quot;continuous therapy&quot;) (CT), the actual optimal duration of relapse treatment is still&#xD;
      unknown. Of note, many experts advocate that a &quot;fixed duration&quot; of therapy should be favored,&#xD;
      especially if one can show that CT does not translate into a significant overall survival&#xD;
      (OS) benefit. As a matter of fact, given the extremely high cost of such novel agents (&gt;100&#xD;
      KEuros/year/patient), the pharmacoeconomic consequences of a &quot;continuous&quot; versus &quot;fixed&quot;&#xD;
      duration therapy are also of utmost importance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on this background, the investigator propose to conduct a non-inferiority phase III&#xD;
      randomized, multicenter, open label trial for treatment of MM at first relapse, comparing the&#xD;
      Dara-Len-Dex combination administered continuously until PD, versus a fixed duration of 24&#xD;
      months. The choice of this duration is justified by the currently available evidence with&#xD;
      respect to achievement of a plateau in terms of deep disease response, patients' compliance,&#xD;
      and physicians' preference according to different surveys. The primary objective of this&#xD;
      study is to estimate the OS rate at 4 years after diagnosis of relapse and initiation of&#xD;
      salvage therapy. The primary endpoint is OS at 4 years after randomization. The analysis will&#xD;
      be performed on both per-protocol and intent-to-treat sets of patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MM is a B cells malignancy, and is one of the most frequent primary neoplasms of the bone&#xD;
      marrow. The fundamental pathology is an expansion of a single clone of plasma cells that&#xD;
      produce monoclonal immunoglobulin (M-proteins) and replace normal bone marrow. Although the&#xD;
      etiology of myeloma is not known, several studies have shown that myeloma cells acquire&#xD;
      certain genetic changes that allow for uncontrolled growth, migration, and protection from&#xD;
      apoptosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of MM in Europe is 6.0 cases per 100,000 per year, with a median age at&#xD;
      diagnosis between 63 and 70 years; the mortality is 4.1 cases per 100,000 per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dara is a human IgG1ĸ monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity to a unique epitope&#xD;
      on CD38, a transmembrane glycoprotein. It is a targeted immunotherapy directed towards tumor&#xD;
      cells that express high levels of CD38, such as plasma cells from patients with MM. This&#xD;
      target is distinct from those of other approved agents for MM therapy. Darashowed promising&#xD;
      efficacy alone and with Len and Den in a phase 1-2 study involving patients with relapsed or&#xD;
      refractory MM. Subsequently, a phase 3 trial randomized 569 MM patients to receive Len and&#xD;
      Den (Len-Dex; control group) or in combination with Dara (Dara-Len-Dex group) With a median&#xD;
      follow-up of 25.4 months, progression-free survival was significantly prolonged in the&#xD;
      Dara-Len-Dex group (median not reached versus 17.5 months in the control group; HR, 0.41; 95%&#xD;
      CI, 0.31-0.53; P &lt;0.0001). A significantly higher rate of overall response was observed in&#xD;
      the Dara-Len-Dex group than in the control group (93% vs. 76%, P&lt;0.0001), as was a higher&#xD;
      rate of complete response or better (51% vs. 21%, P&lt;0.0001). Furthermore, the rates of&#xD;
      treatment discontinuation owing to adverse events were low and similar in the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator propose to conduct a non-inferiority phase III randomized, multicenter, open&#xD;
      label trial for treatment of MM at first relapse, comparing the Dara-Len-Dex combination&#xD;
      administered continuously until PD, versus a fixed duration of 24 months. The choice of this&#xD;
      duration is justified by the currently available evidence with respect to achievement of a&#xD;
      plateau in terms of deep disease response, patients' compliance, and physicians' preference&#xD;
      according to different surveys. As a matter of fact, given the extremely high cost of such&#xD;
      novel agents (&gt;100 KEuros/year/patient), the pharmacoeconomic consequences of a &quot;continuous&quot;&#xD;
      versus &quot;fixed&quot; duration therapy are also of utmost importance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dosage, route of administration and administration schedule of the medications prescribed are&#xD;
      in accordance with the FDA and EMEA authorization in MM first relapse. Only the duration of&#xD;
      combination is compared. One group of patient will receive the Dara-Len-Dex combination until&#xD;
      PD in accordance with the FDA and EMEA authorization in MM first relapse (standard of care).&#xD;
      The experimental group will receive the Dara-Len-Dex combination for up to 24 months. This&#xD;
      shorter duration of treatment (24 months) is justified by the currently available evidence&#xD;
      with respect to achievement of a plateau in terms of deep disease response, patients'&#xD;
      compliance, and physicians' preference according to different surveys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the current protocol is to investigate whether a fixed duration of treatment (24&#xD;
      months) with the Dara-Len-Dex combination is not inferior to the continuous administration of&#xD;
      the combination until PD. In this study some patients may have a similar OS while receiving a&#xD;
      shorter duration of treatment. This study may allow to deliver a shorter duration of therapy&#xD;
      for the treatment of MM at first relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The foreseeable risks are those of an earlier relapse in patients receiving a fixed duration&#xD;
      of Dara-Len-Dex combination compare to the situation where they would have received the&#xD;
      treatment until PD.&#xD;
