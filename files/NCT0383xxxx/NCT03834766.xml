      To evaluate the efficacy of AMPH ER TAB compared to placebo in adult patients with ADHD aged&#xD;
      18 to 60 years.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind (DB), placebo-controlled, parallel, study to assess the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of AMPH ER TAB compared to placebo for the treatment of ADHD in adults&#xD;
      aged 18 to 60 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After Screening and Baseline evaluations are complete, eligible subjects will be randomized&#xD;
      in the study to take DB AMPH ER TAB or matching placebo orally once daily in the morning&#xD;
      beginning the day after the Baseline visit for 5 weeks. Dose will be titrated on a weekly&#xD;
      basis to reach 20 mg per day.Subjects who cannot tolerate the study drug will be discontinued&#xD;
      from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Math Test placement test will be done at Screening or at Baseline. At Visit 5, efficacy&#xD;
      assessments will include the administration of serial Math Tests at pre-dose and at 0.5, 1,&#xD;
      2, 4, 8, 10, 12, 13, and 14 hours post-dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult Investigator Symptom Rating Scale (AISRS) and Clinical Global Impression Scale Severity&#xD;
      (CGI-S) will be conducted at Baseline and Visits 1 to 5. Digit Symbol Substitution Test&#xD;
      (DSST) will be administered at Baseline and Visit 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety assessments will include treatment-emergent adverse events, physical examination,&#xD;
      vital signs, body weight, Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS), and direct&#xD;
      questioning to assess for sleep, appetite, mood and psychotic events.&#xD;

The model will include treatment, time and treatment by time as fixed effects and subject as a random effect. Pre-dose Math Test score will be included as a covariate. The difference between AMPH ER TAB and placebo will be assessed at the alpha = 0.05 level of significance.</description>
