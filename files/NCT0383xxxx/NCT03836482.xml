  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the selective cytopheretic device on the immune&#xD;
      dysregulated state of congestive heart failure(CHF) with CRS and to assess the benefit of the&#xD;
      device to improve cardiovascular and renal function. The study will enroll eligible patients&#xD;
      in the ICU with acute on chronic systolic heart failure and worsening renal function due to&#xD;
      cardiorenal syndrome while awaiting LVAD implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study patients who are eligible and agree to participate will receive treatment with&#xD;
      the SCD. The treatment will be for 6 hours a day up to 6 days. Additionally, participants&#xD;
      will have additional study procedures and be evaluated to determine if their kidney function&#xD;
      improves enough to undergo LVAD implantation.&#xD;
