  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is one of the most frequent malignancies worldwide,&#xD;
      and an increasing incidence has been documented over the past decades. Despite optimal&#xD;
      initial approach, which can be curative in the majority of cases, a proportion of patients&#xD;
      present with locally advanced or unresectable disease, leading to significant morbidity. In&#xD;
      addition, metastases of cSCC may affect 2 to 5% of individuals diagnosed with this disease.&#xD;
      In the setting of advanced cSCC, no standard systemic treatment has been established, and&#xD;
      treatment options are frequently adapted from those applied to squamous cell carcinoma&#xD;
      arising from other sites, based on a low level of evidence and often with short-lived&#xD;
      benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      cSCC are potentially immunogenic neoplasms with an unmet need for therapeutic options, having&#xD;
      sun exposure and chronic inflammation as the most significant risk factors. Using the&#xD;
      anti-PD1 monoclonal antibody nivolumab to treat patients with cSCC and planned scientific&#xD;
      correlates, investigators believe that the safety and efficacy of immune activating therapy&#xD;
      for this disease can be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multi-center, Simon two-stage, phase II study to evaluate the safety and efficacy&#xD;
      of the anti-PD1 monoclonal antibody nivolumab for systemic-treatment-naïve patients with&#xD;
      metastatic and/or locally advanced cSCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy, as assessed by the best&#xD;
      objective response rate (complete response + partial response) at 24 weeks according to&#xD;
      RECIST criteria, of nivolumab in patients with advanced cSCC. Secondary objectives are to&#xD;
      assess the safety/tolerability of the treatment, to determine the progression-free survival&#xD;
      (PFS) and overall survival (OS) rates at 24 weeks, and to evaluate the objective response&#xD;
      rate as assessed by immune-related response criteria (irRC). Treatment will be given every 14&#xD;
      days until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of consent/patient&#xD;
      decision. If the patient continues to benefit from treatment with nivolumab, treatment will&#xD;
      be continued for up to 12 months. Patients will be reassessed at week 12 and every 12 weeks&#xD;
      thereafter until week 52, and then as per discretion of the treating investigator. A tumor&#xD;
      biopsy will be performed before treatment initiation, unless contraindicated and optional&#xD;
      biopsies will be performed at week 13 and following disease progression. Serial blood samples&#xD;
      will be obtained at baseline, during, and after treatment.&#xD;
