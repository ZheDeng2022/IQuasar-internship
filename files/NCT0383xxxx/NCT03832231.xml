  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mechanical ventilation is a life-saving treatment that can be associated with diaphragm&#xD;
      dysfunction, a potentially deleterious acquired disability. It may be the consequence of&#xD;
      disuse - under mechanical ventilation, respiratory muscles are unloaded - or the consequence&#xD;
      of muscle overuse because of insufficient unloading. Evaluating diaphragm function is&#xD;
      therefore crucial to optimally tailor the ventilator assistance. Measurement of&#xD;
      transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi) is the reference method to assess diaphragm function but it&#xD;
      invasiveness hinders the generalization of its use. Previous studies have reported that&#xD;
      ultrasound can quantify diaphragm thickening and that diaphragm thickening fraction (TFdi) is&#xD;
      a good marker of diaphragm function. Since diaphragm becomes stiffer when it contracts, the&#xD;
      investigators aim at exploring whether the measurement of diaphragm stiffness by transient&#xD;
      shear wave elastography would improve the evaluation of diaphragm function with ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the objectives of the study are to evaluate the performance of transient shear&#xD;
      wave elastography applied to the diaphragm to estimate Pdi in mechanically ventilated&#xD;
      patients as compared to TFdi and to correlate the changes in elastography derived indices, in&#xD;
      TFdi and in Pdi into different ventilatory conditions and during a spontaneous breathing&#xD;
      trial. Pdi will be obtained using catheters positioned in patients' stomachs and esophagus&#xD;
      and diaphragm stiffness will be assessed by measuring the shear modulus of the diaphragm with&#xD;
      a dedicated ultrasound machine (Aixplorer, Ultrasonic). TFdi will be also measured as&#xD;
      previously reported. Pdi, TFdi and shear modulus will be measured at the end of each four&#xD;
      following 10 minutes-conditions: 1) baseline with initial ventilator settings (set by the&#xD;
      physician in charge of patient); 2) 25%-increase in pressure support and initial PEEP; 3)&#xD;
      25%-decrease in pressure support and initial PEEP and 4) initial level of pressure support&#xD;
      and ZEEP. Finally, the same measurements will be done at the beginning of a 30 minutes&#xD;
      spontaneous breathing trial.&#xD;

      Objective :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to correlate ultrasound indices (thickness, thickening, rigidity) to&#xD;
      the measurement of transdiaphragmatic pressure in the evaluation of the diaphragmatic&#xD;
      function of patients under mechanical ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are: 1. Correlate thickening of the diaphragm with Pdi, 2. Correlate&#xD;
      diaphragmatic thickening with diaphragmatic stiffness 3. Describe these correlations under&#xD;
      different levels of pressure ventilatory support, 4. Describe the evolution of diaphragmatic&#xD;
      stiffness, thickening and Pdi pressure during a ventilator liberating trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is the measurement of Pdi. The secondary endpoints are the diaphragm&#xD;
      thickening fraction and diaphragm stiffness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Pdi will be obtained by measuring the esophageal and gastric pressures through&#xD;
      nasogastric tube equipped with balloons. The position of each of the balloons will be checked&#xD;
      by displaying the esophageal and gastric pressure lines. The intragastric position will be&#xD;
      confirmed by mild abdominal compression. The oesophageal position is based on visualization&#xD;
      of cardiac artifacts on the pressure pattern and signal deflations related to inspiratory&#xD;
      movements. The signals of the esophageal and gastric pressures will be displayed continuously&#xD;
      and their resultant - transdiapragmatic pressure - will be automatically calculated in real&#xD;
      time by the software. It will also record pressure in the airways at the endotracheal tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be placed in half-sitting position to allow better recognition of the&#xD;
      diaphragm. Using the ultrasound system Aixplorer® (Aix en Provence, France V9), equipped with&#xD;
      a high resolution probe (6 MHz). The probe will be positioned at the intercostal space above&#xD;
      the tenth rib on the right axillary line and directed perpendicular to the diaphragm&#xD;
      (apposition zone). The measurements will be performed &quot;offline&quot; and the calculation of the&#xD;
      thickening fraction will be performed in blind clinical conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diaphragmatic elastography will be determined using the same ultrasound system&#xD;
      (Aixplorer®, Aix en Provence, France V9, provided with a high resolution probe (SL10-2,&#xD;
      central frequency, 6 MHz)). The anatomical approach is the same as the intercostal approach&#xD;
      described previously. After finding the diaphragm in B mode, a transition to SWE&#xD;
      (elastography) mode will be performed. Three successive measurements will be made on the same&#xD;
      region of interest, the average of the three measurements will be retained. The variation of&#xD;
      the shear modulus during the inspiratory time will also be calculated post hoc. As for&#xD;
      standard ultrasound, records analysis will be performed in blind conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pdi, ultrasound derived indices and shear wave modulus will be measured under several&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. At baseline: initial ventilator settings set by the physician in charge of patient&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 25%-increase in pressure support and initial PEEP during 10 minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. 25%-decrease in pressure support and initial PEEP during 10 minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. initial level of pressure support without PEEP (PEEP = 0) during 10 minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Measurement of the maximal inspiratory pressure during an inspiratory occlusion maneuver&#xD;
           lasting 20 seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. A 30 minutes Ventilator liberating trial without PEEP nor Pressure Support (CPAP=0)&#xD;
