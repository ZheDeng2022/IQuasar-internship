  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Does the tumor thickness value of buccal squamous cell carcinomas, predict cervical nodal&#xD;
      metastasis in clinically and radio-graphical neck negative (N0) thus sparing such patients&#xD;
      unnecessary surgical procedures and it's associated morbidities? The aim of the study is to&#xD;
      evaluate the prognostic value of tumor thickness cut off 4 mm in predicting cervical nodal&#xD;
      metastases in a population of Egyptian patients presenting with Buccal Squamous Cell&#xD;
      Carcinoma. The hypothesis is that patients with tumor thickness less than 4 mm will present&#xD;
      with significantly less cervical nodal metastasis.&#xD;

      Patients will be recruited from the outpatient clinics of Al Monofia university hospital,&#xD;
      Cairo University Hospital and National Cancer Institute. Patients who fits the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria and are motivated and consent to enter the study will be included. Patient&#xD;
      recruitment will continue until the target sample size is reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients data will be collected including personal data, medical history, family history, and&#xD;
      classification of the tumor according to the TNM classification system. Patients will be&#xD;
      assessed preoperatively with a transcutaneous high frequency probe ultrasound to measure the&#xD;
      maximal tumor thickness in millimeters using a 10MHz superficial probe and the lymph nodes in&#xD;
      the neck region. In addition to clinical examination and palpation of the neck lymph nodes.&#xD;
      Patients will then undergo tumor resection surgery with adequate safety margins under GA with&#xD;
      nasotracheal intubation. Selective neck dissection will then be performed. The specimens will&#xD;
      be submitted for histopathological examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive standard post operative care based on the recommendation of the&#xD;
      oncologist. Adjunct chemo or radiotherapy will be administered when deemed necessary. Wound&#xD;
      care and dressings will be administered as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be categorized into two groups based on the tumor thickness (exposure).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the primary outcome, the data source will be the measurement of tumor depth based on&#xD;
      Berslow method as discussed in the review of literature, obtained from ultrasonography and&#xD;
      recorded in millimeters.Tumor width recorded in (mm) will also be obtained from the&#xD;
      ultrasonography as it may be a source of confounders. Further, histological grade of the&#xD;
      lesion will also be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two confounding factors are highlighted and may be sources of bias and attempt to control for&#xD;
      them in the statistical analyses will be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Appropriate statistical methods will be used after collection of the data and sources of&#xD;
      confounders will be controlled for during analyses in subgroup An attempt to control for&#xD;
      tumor width and histological grade in subgroup analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be entered electronically. Patients' files are to be stored in numerical order&#xD;
      and stored in secure and accessible place. All data will be maintained in storage for 1 year&#xD;
      after completion of the study. Data monitoring committee is independent from the sponsor and&#xD;
      competing interest.&#xD;
