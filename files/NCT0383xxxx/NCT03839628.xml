  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an interventional study enrolling older individuals aged 60-85y to observe changes&#xD;
      during physical inactivity. This study is investigating the relation between short-term&#xD;
      physical inactivity and the impact of muscle health and function. The enrollment goal is 8&#xD;
      participants. The study will occur over the course of a month where participants will undergo&#xD;
      testing before and after a reduction in physically activity levels. There will be a screening&#xD;
      event collecting baseline data, two body composition scans, muscle function and oral glucose&#xD;
      tolerance tests and a metabolic study before and after a 2-week period of inactivity. Each&#xD;
      metabolic study will entail three-muscle biopsies: one before and 2 after the ingestion of&#xD;
      leucine.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pre-testing- The baseline evaluation will assess muscle function and strength, and an oral&#xD;
      glucose tolerance test. After the baseline visit, participants will be provided with a step&#xD;
      activity monitor to track their level of activity. This will provide a baseline of the&#xD;
      participant's normal level of physical activity so an accurate level of 75% activity&#xD;
      reduction can be determined. A 3-day daily dietary diary will be provided for the participant&#xD;
      to self-report prior to the experiment, as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 1- After the participant completes their normal activity log and dietary diary, they will&#xD;
      be asked to return to the research center for a body composition scan and a metabolic study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The metabolic study will involve blood sampling from an arm vein and muscle biopsies from the&#xD;
      thigh before and after a leucine drink.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2-week period of inactivity- After the metabolic study, the participant will return home and&#xD;
      maintain a reduced level of activity (75% reduction) for a two-week period. During this time,&#xD;
      the participant will receive phone calls from research personnel in order to maintain&#xD;
      adherence to the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 14- After the 2-week reduced activity period, the participant will return to the research&#xD;
      center to receive a body composition scan and undergo a metabolic study identical to 'Day 1'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-testing- After Day 14, the participant will be asked to return once again to the&#xD;
      research center for a oral glucose tolerance test and the exercise lab for muscle function&#xD;
      testing.&#xD;
