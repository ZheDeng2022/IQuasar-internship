    <measure>Rate of Severe Hypoglycemia at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Severe hypoglycemia is defined as an event requiring assistance of another person to administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions. During these episodes, the participant has an altered mental status and cannot assist in his or her own care, or may be semiconscious or unconscious, or experience coma with or without seizures, and may require parenteral therapy. Rate of severe hypoglycemia events per 100 years during a defined period was calculated by total number of severe hypoglycemia episodes within the period divided by the cumulative days on treatment from all participants within a treatment group *36525.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of Documented Symptomatic Hypoglycemia at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Documented symptomatic hypoglycemia is an event during which typical symptoms of hypoglycemia are accompanied by blood glucose (BG) of &lt;54 mg/dL [3.0 millimole per liter (mmol/L)]. The rate of documented symptomatic hypoglycemia was estimated by negative binomial model: number of episodes = treatment with log (treatment exposure in days/365.25) as an offset variable.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in 1,5-Anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG) at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG) is a marker of short-term glycemic control especially postprandial hyperglycemia. 1,5-AG accurately predicts rapid changes in glycemia and is tightly associated with glucose fluctuations and postprandial glucose. LS Mean was calculated using mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) including fixed class effects of treatment, strata (Pooled Country + Hemoglobin A1C Stratum + Personal continuous glucose Monitor (CGM) or Flash glucose monitor (FGM) use during study flag), visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction, as well as the continuous, fixed covariates of baseline value. The analysis included data collected prior to permanent discontinuation of study drug.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <pre_assignment_details>The purpose of the lead-in period was to assess basal rates and bolus calculator settings and adjust if needed prior to randomization. Participants (Pts) were then randomized to insulin lispro (Humalog) or ultra-rapid lispro as both basal and bolus insulin and delivered bolus doses 0 to 2 minutes prior to each meal (pre-meal).</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) Efficacy Estimand at Week 16</title>
        <description>HbA1c is the glycosylated fraction of hemoglobin A. HbA1c is measured to identify average plasma glucose concentration over prolonged periods of time.&#xD;
Least Squares (LS) mean was determined by mixed-model repeated measures (MMRM) model with covariates: Baseline + Pooled Country + Personal continuous glucose Monitor (CGM) or Flash glucose monitor (FGM) use during study flag + Treatment + Time + Treatment*Time (Type III sum of squares). The efficacy estimand included participant data when baseline and at least one post-baseline measurement were available prior to permanent discontinuation of study drug.</description>

        <title>Rate of Severe Hypoglycemia at Week 16</title>
        <description>Severe hypoglycemia is defined as an event requiring assistance of another person to administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions. During these episodes, the participant has an altered mental status and cannot assist in his or her own care, or may be semiconscious or unconscious, or experience coma with or without seizures, and may require parenteral therapy. Rate of severe hypoglycemia events per 100 years during a defined period was calculated by total number of severe hypoglycemia episodes within the period divided by the cumulative days on treatment from all participants within a treatment group *36525.</description>
