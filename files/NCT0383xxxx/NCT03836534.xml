      Department (AED) during the permanence of care the week of March 11 to 17, 2018. The data&#xD;

      given to the consultation and would take place by telephone contact of patients within 48&#xD;
      hours of the consultation.&#xD;

      Study of the observance of emergency exit treatments during the permanence of care. This is a&#xD;
      descriptive study with a prospective data collection that does not alter the management of&#xD;
      the patient. The study is epidemiological, cross-sectional, prospective inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators would like to include patients consulting in a AED during the permanence of&#xD;
      care the week of March 11 to 17, 2018. The data collection would concern socio-demographic&#xD;
      data, their consultation to the AED, the follow-up given to the consultation and would take&#xD;
      place by telephone contact of patients within 48 hours of the consultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective is to study the follow-up given by the consultation to the emergencies, in&#xD;
      terms of compliance, follow-up of the recommendations, the objective sought by the patient&#xD;
      coming to the emergency department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Understand the motivation of the consultation and why the treatment was not followed where&#xD;
      appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Is there a sociodemographic explanation or is it the health network that results in the&#xD;
      saturation of emergency services? Does the system still meet the expectations of people using&#xD;
      it?&#xD;
