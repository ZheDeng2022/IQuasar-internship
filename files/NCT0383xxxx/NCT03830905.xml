      The innovative drug XC221 is planned for use in treatment of acute respiratory viral&#xD;
      infections in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, comparative multicenter study&#xD;
      assessing the safety, tolerability and efficacy of XC221 at a dose of 200 mg per day in&#xD;
      patients with uncomplicated influenza or other acute respiratory viral infections during the&#xD;
      3-days treatment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, comparative multicenter study in two groups.&#xD;
      A total of 120 patients with uncomplicated influenza or other acute respiratory viral&#xD;
      infections are planned to be randomized. Patients will be randomized into 2 groups: 60&#xD;
      patients in the treatment group 200 mg XC221 and 60 patients in the placebo group. The&#xD;
      purpose of the clinical trial is to assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of the drug&#xD;
      XC21 in treatment of influenza or other acute respiratory viral infections. The primary&#xD;
      objective is to demonstrate the difference between the groups in the time of the onset of&#xD;
      sustained improvement in clinical symptoms according to the Modified Jackson Scale. The study&#xD;
      will consist of the following periods: screening (duration not more than 36 hours from the&#xD;
      moment of the first symptoms of the disease), treatment period (3 days), follow-up period (11&#xD;
      ± 1 days after completion of treatment with the study drug/placebo). The duration of&#xD;
      participation in the study for each patient is no more than 16 days and 12 hours.&#xD;
