    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in 2 parts: dose escalation part and expansion part. The study&#xD;
      will include Pre-treatment Phase, Treatment Phase, and Extension Phase (in expansion part&#xD;
      only).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants from Pre-Treatment Phase (screening period) will enter into the&#xD;
      Treatment Phase to receive E7386. After Treatment Phase, participants will be followed in&#xD;
      follow-up period of Extension Phase (in expansion part only).&#xD;
