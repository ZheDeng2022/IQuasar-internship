    <textblock>
      The VAST study is a single-center prospective observational study that enrolled individuals&#xD;
      with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) within 24 hours onset. The patients will receive&#xD;
      neurological examination, multimodal computed tomographic perfusion (CTP) or multimodal&#xD;
      magnetic resonance perfusion (MRP) before reperfusion therapy. The hypoperfusion volume,&#xD;
      ischemic core volume, brain edema, cerebral arterial collaterals will be evaluated on&#xD;
      baseline brain image. The status of cerebral venous system (CVs) including superficial middle&#xD;
      cerebral vein, vein of Labbe, vein of Trolard, Sphenoid sinus, thalamostriate vein, Internal&#xD;
      cerebral vein, Rosenthal's vein will be evaluated in phases of reconstructed imaging from&#xD;
      CTP/MRP. The investigators will explore the venous markers for prognosis of AIS patients who&#xD;
      received reperfusion therapy, and find the role of venous system in reperfusion injury.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Stroke therapy had entered a new era since endovascular therapy was introduced in addition to&#xD;
      intravenous thrombolysis. The benefit of endovascular therapy for patients with a proven&#xD;
      proximal intracranial arterial occlusion has recently been revealed in several large&#xD;
      randomized controlled trials. However, a substantial number of patients treated with&#xD;
      reperfusion therapy did not reach functional independence in long-term follow-up, despite&#xD;
      relatively high recanalization rates. Therefore, simple and more reliable markers that&#xD;
      identify patients most likely to benefit from reperfusion therapy are needed. Accumulated&#xD;
      studies showed that arterial status such as arterial collaterals had been considered as a&#xD;
      critical predictor of outcome or determinant criteria for therapeutic selection. However,&#xD;
      other evidences denied that arterial collaterals serve as a predictors for outcome after&#xD;
      recanalization. Moreover, non-reflow phenomenon, over-reperfusion and futile recanalization&#xD;
      may lead to large infarct, brain swelling, hemorrhagic complication and neurological&#xD;
      deterioration. The traditional pathophysiological understanding on ischemic stroke can hardly&#xD;
      explain these occurrences. Recently, the importance of cerebral venous drainage, the major&#xD;
      blood reservoir and drainage system in brain, has been described for stroke evolution and&#xD;
      clinical sequelae. In this study, the aim is to investigate the roles of cerebral venous&#xD;
      dynamic status on neurological outcome after reperfusion therapy and the potential mechanisms&#xD;
      behind poor veins and adverse outcome. In this study, the investigators will prospectively&#xD;
      recruit the AIS patients over 18 years old who undergo baseline CTP/MRP and receive&#xD;
      reperfusion therapy within 24 hour after onset. Each of their perfusion imaging will be&#xD;
      reconstructed to evaluate the status of cerebral vein system. The investigators hypothesized&#xD;
      that the venous dynamic status may have effect on the ischemic-reperfusion progress, and may&#xD;
      thus has the potential to impact the stroke outcome. This study may add new implications for&#xD;
      stroke outcome prediction and future therapeutic decision-making.&#xD;
