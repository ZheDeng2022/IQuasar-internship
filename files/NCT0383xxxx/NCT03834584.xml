  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and clinical&#xD;
      activity of AG-636, an oral Dihydroorotate Dehydrogenase (DHODH) inhibitor, in subjects with&#xD;
      advanced lymphoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Phase 1, multicenter, open-label study is to determine the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD) of AG-636 and characterize its dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) when&#xD;
      given by mouth to subjects with advanced lymphoma that is refractory to standard treatment.&#xD;
      During the dose escalation part of the study successive cohorts of subjects will be treated&#xD;
      with increasing doses of AG-636 in order to determine its maximum tolerated dose (MTD).&#xD;
      Subsequently, in the dose expansion part of the study, additional subjects will be treated at&#xD;
      the MTD in order to confirm that dose's safety, tolerability, PK and PD, and to provide an&#xD;
      opportunity to detect anti-lymphoma activity. The dose expansion part of the study will&#xD;
      support the selection of a dose for future clinical studies (a recommended Phase 2 dose&#xD;
      [RP2D]).&#xD;

             included in this study must fall within one of the following 2017 World Health&#xD;
             Organization categories:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Mature B-cell neoplasms (excluding plasma cell neoplasms, heavy chain disease,&#xD;
                  and primary central nervous system [CNS] lymphoma)&#xD;

&#xD;
               3. Hodgkin lymphomas&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Immunodeficiency-associated lymphoproliferative disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. In the case of subjects who have lymphoma for which high-dose chemotherapy and&#xD;
             autologous stem cell transplantation (HD-ASCT) is considered a standard curative&#xD;
             therapy, eligibility for this study requires that the subject's disease has relapsed&#xD;
             after HD-ASCT, that the subject is not eligible for HD-ASCT, or that the subject has&#xD;
             refused HD-ASCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Have disease that can be clinically evaluated for improvement or progression. In the&#xD;
             dose expansion phase of the study, subjects must have disease that is measurable (as&#xD;
             defined by either the Lugano criteria for lymphoma or the 2011 ISCL/USCLC/EORTC&#xD;
             criteria for MF/SS).&#xD;

             determined to be due to involvement by the underlying hematologic malignancy, subjects&#xD;
             must have ALT/AST levels &lt;5.0× the ULN.(Note: There are no specific requirements for&#xD;
             alkaline phosphatase [ALP].)&#xD;
