  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of the study drug, pembrolizumab, and to find&#xD;
      out how well it works to prevent cancer from coming back in people who have had a solid tumor&#xD;
      surgically removed, but still have tumor cells in their blood. During the study, the&#xD;
      participant will receive either the study drug or a placebo for as long as 12 months, or&#xD;
      until the cancer comes back, or the side effects of the treatment become too severe.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status 0-1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any solid tumor with MSI or MRD by IHC, PCR or NGS testing. MSKCC confirmation of&#xD;
             MSI-H/MRD status is not mandatory prior to enrollment and treatment on the study. For&#xD;
             patients with outside testing, if sufficient tissue is available NGS will be repeated&#xD;
             at MSKCC and will not impact the patient's eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have genetic testing of DNA from primary tumor for somatic genomic alterations&#xD;
             across a minimum of 50 genes.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Must have completed standard of care (SOC) surgery, neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  To be eligible for pembrolizumab or placebo therapy, the patients must have positive&#xD;
             ctDNA (as defined in section 7.0) within 4 months after completion of appropriate&#xD;
             standard of care therapy (surgery, chemotherapy, radiation as appropriate). Note, if&#xD;
             ctDNA has a negative result, ctDNA can be re-tested up to 3 months later, within 9&#xD;
             months of completion of standard therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must sign informed consent within 4 weeks of positive ctDNA result. The 4&#xD;
             weeks is considered from the date that the ctDNA is resulted, and not the date it is&#xD;
             drawn.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Albumin ≥3 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;

             MD) related to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of metastatic or recurrent disease.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  The use of inhaled corticosteroids and mineralocorticoids (e.g., fludrocortisone) for&#xD;
