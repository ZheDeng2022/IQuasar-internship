  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In mobility, the potential for mobility and social inclusion, according to individual&#xD;
      desires, represents the primary component of well-being and should be a priority for&#xD;
      caregivers of older adults and older adults. As a result of our literature researches, it was&#xD;
      found that there was no Turkish scale evaluating the living area. For this reason, this study&#xD;
      was planned in order to translate the Turkish Life-Space Assessment [LSA] into Turkish, to&#xD;
      investigate the validity and reliability of the Turkish version and to perform its cultural&#xD;
      adaptation. Our study is expected to improve the quality of health assessment in our country,&#xD;
      to contribute to objective evaluation methods, and to provide benefits such as assisting&#xD;
      physicians, physiotherapists and other related health care team during the evaluation&#xD;
      process.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Decrease in movement and limitation is common in older adults. Compared to the general&#xD;
      population where mobility is restricted in 10.1% of individuals, this rate rises to 15.4% for&#xD;
      those aged 50-69 and increases to 36.2% after 70 years of age . Mobility has direct and&#xD;
      direct consequences for maintaining the independence and autonomy of all older adults.&#xD;
      Decreased mobility increases both quality of life and formal and informal care needs . For&#xD;
      older adults, mobility can be the most important functional skill required to maintain social&#xD;
      roles and quests, and the decrease in mobility is often in front of disability in daily&#xD;
      living activities (GYA) (2). Mobility assessments range from biomechanical measurements to&#xD;
      broader assessments of people's daily lives .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ambulation problems are fundamentally conceptualized in relation to internal and upper-level&#xD;
      movement (when a person leaves his / her home or takes a mile of distance üst etc.). This&#xD;
      limitation of movement is common among older adults and increases with age. The emergence and&#xD;
      progression of age-related chronic diseases is a reason why the elderly population continues&#xD;
      to be at increased risk for mobility loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditional measures such as GYA (bath, dressing, transfer, toilet and food) and Instrumental&#xD;
      Activities of Daily Life (GYAA - light and heavy housework, food preparation, shopping and&#xD;
      money management) are special functions that are an integral part of mobility. On the other&#xD;
      hand, the living space reflects integration and social inclusion in geographically defined&#xD;
      areas and measures how much, how often, and how independently individuals act in their&#xD;
      environment. This assessment provides a measure of mobility throughout the observed function&#xD;
      among elderly adults living in the community, which may have different and multiple chronic&#xD;
      diseases and different disability levels. Living space mobility enables the participation of&#xD;
      individuals in the community or the mobility of the individual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the maintenance of all aspects of health in aging individuals has gained importance as&#xD;
      the focus of the research, there has been much debate about proper measurement. Muldoon et&#xD;
      al. Reported that it is very important in the post-illness effects beyond the immediate&#xD;
      effects of the disease to examine the effects of people on their daily lives. Traditional&#xD;
      treatment and evaluation methods are focused on function and ability to perform certain tasks&#xD;
      . However, the difficulty in these measures may not be evident until later in disability&#xD;
      models. In contrast, the habitat provides a measure of full mobility continuity, which allows&#xD;
      for differentiation in the upper limits of in healthy aging.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The methodological model of the study is validity reliability study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The validity and reliability of Turkish LSA , whose validity and reliability have been&#xD;
           demonstrated in different languages (French, English), will be investigated.&#xD;
           Authorization from the author of the original LSA (Prof. Patricia SAWYER) was obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1 1: The Turkish version of LSA is a valid scale. H1 2: The Turkish version of LSA is a&#xD;
      reliable scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It is planned that the data will be collected on a voluntary basis from the individuals&#xD;
           who live in the province of Elazığ and comply with the inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the validity and reliability studies, it is stated that the sample size should be at&#xD;
           least five times or even ten times the number of items. Since LSA is a 20-item scale and&#xD;
           the sample size is recommended as x5-x10 in similar studies, it is planned to carry out&#xD;
           the study on 100 volunteer individuals .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inclusion Criteria of the Volunteers&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  65 years and over,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Contactable,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Individuals who are independent in their daily activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Criteria for Exclusion of Participants in Research&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  64 years and under,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Do not read, understand and write in Turkish,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Unable to communicate,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Individuals dependent on one in daily living activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age, gender, height, body weight, body mass index, marital status, working status, residence&#xD;
      area (urban - rural), accessibility of the housing (fully accessible, partially accessible&#xD;
      and not accessible) information about the life expectancy in the neighborhood, the history of&#xD;
      falling within the last 6 months, the use of ancillary equipment, the existence of the&#xD;
      driver's license, the existence of a single life, the education and income levels, and the&#xD;
      information contained in the demographic information form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to evaluate the quality of life of the participants in the study, the validity and&#xD;
      reliability study developed by Ware in 1987 and in our country was reviewed by Koçyiğit et&#xD;
      al. SF-36 scale was used. In this scale, where health is examined in 8 components, high&#xD;
      scores indicate a better level of health. SF-36 scale; physical function (FF) (limitation in&#xD;
      physical activity due to health problems), physical role (FR) (restriction in daily living&#xD;
      activities due to health problems), bodily pain (BA), general health (GS) (assessment of&#xD;
      health of the person in general), vitality ( CA) consists of general mental health (GRS),&#xD;
      social functionality (SF), and emotional role (DR) (restriction of daily living activities&#xD;
      due to mental health problems). The SF-36 scale scales 100 points and the scores vary between&#xD;
      0 and 100 points for each component .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The translation process for the preparation of the Turkish LSA form to be applied to the&#xD;
      cases will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to translate the LSA into Turkish and to investigate its validity and reliability,&#xD;
      the recommendations developed by Guillemin et al. And Beaton et al. Will be utilized . The&#xD;
      English version of LSA will be translated into Turkish by two persons independently. These&#xD;
      two different Turkish versions will be analyzed by an expert committee. The translations will&#xD;
      be evaluated by considering Turkish cultural characteristics. A common version (Version1)&#xD;
      will then be created from these translations. Version 1 will be translated back to English by&#xD;
      a non-medical specialist and a native speaker. This will be compared with the original LSA by&#xD;
      the expert committee to determine the equivalence of the reverse translation. At the end of&#xD;
      this phase, the common version 2 will be obtained and compared with the original LSA to&#xD;
      determine equivalence. A pilot study will be carried out with 20 participants (10 males and&#xD;
      10 females) after confirming the equivalence of the original LSA and Turkish version of the&#xD;
      committee or, if necessary, making some corrections. The main objective of this phase is to&#xD;
      determine whether participants understand the questions. The clarity and clarity of each item&#xD;
      will be scored by the participants with the Likert scale and the Content Validity Index (CVI)&#xD;
      of the LSA will be calculated. The Turkish version of the LSA will be reviewed by the expert&#xD;
      committee in the light of the findings and minor changes will be made if necessary. Once the&#xD;
      final decision has been made, the Turkish version of the LSA will be applied to the study&#xD;
      population. To investigate the reliability of the scale, the test-retest procedure will be&#xD;
      followed and the scale will be applied to the same participants for the second time in&#xD;
      24-hour intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPSS for Windows 20.00 computer package program will be used for all statistical analysis.&#xD;
      Descriptive statistical information shall be given as mean ± standard deviation (x ± SD) or%.&#xD;
      Interclass Correlation Coefficients (ICC) and Cronbach güvens coeffi for reliability and&#xD;
      internal consistency of LSA&#xD;
