    <textblock>
      This trial is studying the effects and safety in treating patients from five different&#xD;
      centers with local prostate cancer, employing Composite Steep-pulse(High-frequency&#xD;
      irreversible electroporation) Treatment Apparatus. This device could cause cell irreversible&#xD;
      electroporation, which leading necrosis of tumor cells. It also has the ability to prevent&#xD;
      nerve,vessel, urethral and capsule unnecessary injury beside the ablation area. Composite&#xD;
      Steep-pulse Treatment Apparatus will be used in patients who pass inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
      criteria. Safety, quality of life, and histopathological analysis of prostate speciem will be&#xD;
      evaluated in each study patients.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in elderly males in western country. It is also a&#xD;
      major health concern, especially in China with its greater proportion of elderly men in the&#xD;
      general population. Currently, radical prostatectomy(RP) is the mainstream treatment for&#xD;
      localized PCa to show a benefit for cancer-specific survival (CSS). However, the patient who&#xD;
      underwent RP might suffer from the complication of erectile dysfunction or urinary&#xD;
      incontinence. In 2004, a new method using steep pulses to treat tumor was appeared. It showed&#xD;
      that steep pulses could bring about Irreversible Electroporation (IRE) of cell, leading&#xD;
      tonecrosis of tumor cells. And it seemed to do no harms to the nerve and Vascular epithelial&#xD;
      cell. The device of steep pulse had already been approved by FDA in 2011.However, this device&#xD;
      of steep pulse has disadvantages like: (1)sever muscle contraction;(2)Urethral injury;&#xD;
      (3)Capsule injury;(4)Nerve degeneration. This new device which is called Composite&#xD;
      Steep-pulse(High-frequency irreversible electroporation) Treatment Apparatus, may have the&#xD;
      potential to conquer these disadvantages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. This study will assess the efficacy of Composite Steep-pulse(High-frequency irreversible&#xD;
           electroporation) Treatment Apparatus in the treatment of PCa.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. This study will assess the safety of Composite Steep-pulse(High-frequency irreversible&#xD;
           electroporation) Treatment Apparatus in the treatment of PCa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. patients recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. transperineal maping prostate biopsy(&gt;20 needle) guided by transrectal ultrasound(TRUS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Irreversible Electroporation of malignant Tumor Cell under Composite Steep-pulse&#xD;
           Treatment for the patients with positive biopsy;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Some factors such as prostate MRI,the maping prostate biopsy(&gt;20 needle),the&#xD;
           histopathological outcomes analysis ect. will be performed to evaluate the efficacy of&#xD;
           the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Other factors such as the routine blood test, the routine urine test, the urinary&#xD;
           continence ect. will be performed to evaluate the safety of the treatment.&#xD;
