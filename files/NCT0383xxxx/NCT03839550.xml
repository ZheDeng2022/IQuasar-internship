      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of Apatinib Mesylate combined&#xD;
      with PD-1 antibody SHR-1210 in HCC patients with high risk of disease recurrence contained&#xD;
      microsatellite lesions, microvascular invasion(MVI) or secondary and above portal vein tumor&#xD;
      thrombosis (PVTT) after radical resection. Patients will be randomized 1:1 either to the&#xD;
      experimental arm to receive Apatinib Mesylate and PD-1 antibody SHR-1210 or to the standard&#xD;
      therapy arm of hepatic arterial infusion(HAI) .&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common malignancy worldwide, which is the third cause of&#xD;
      cancer related deaths. Radical hepatic resection is one of the most potentially curative&#xD;
      treatments for HCC. Unfortunately, the long-term survival after radical hepatic resection is&#xD;
      unsatisfactory because of the high incidence of tumor recurrence with the recurrence rates at&#xD;
      2 and 5 years are approximately 50 % to 60 % and 80 %,respectively. Microsatellite lesions,&#xD;
      microvascular invasion (MVI) , or portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT) are the main risk&#xD;
      factors for poor prognosis in HCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HCC is a typical vascular-rich tumor, and its occurrence, development, metastasis and&#xD;
      invasion are closely related to angiogenesis. Due to the long-term chronic inflammatory&#xD;
      response of the liver, the establishment and development of HCC can be induced by creating an&#xD;
      immunosuppressive microenvironment, including up-regulation of PD-1 receptors. Therefore,&#xD;
      immunotherapy is also considered to be a potential effective method for advanced HCC&#xD;
      treatment. And there is little convincing evidence indicating that adjuvant therapy reduces&#xD;
      the risk of recurrence after hepatic resection. Furthermore, no standard regimen has been&#xD;
      established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study, we assessed the efficacy and safety of Apatinib Mesylate that is Small&#xD;
      molecule anti-angiogenic targeted drugs /PD-1 antibody SHR-1210 combination therapy for&#xD;
      surgically resected HCCs with high incidence of tumor recurrence containing microsatellite&#xD;
      lesions, microvascular invasion(MVI) or secondary and above portal vein tumor thrombosis&#xD;
      (PVTT).&#xD;
