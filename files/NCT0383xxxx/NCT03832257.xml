      This prospective cohort study seeks to determine if the ECHO-CT program, a healthcare&#xD;
      videoconferencing program, can improve clinical outcomes while reducing cost and resource&#xD;
      utilization when expanded to a community hospital setting. Data will be analyzed on the&#xD;
      facility level and patient level.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      ECHO-Care Transitions is a healthcare outreach program utilizing videoconferencing technology&#xD;
      to improve the quality and efficiency of care transitions for medically-complex elderly&#xD;
      patients by connecting post-acute care facilities that receive BIDMC patients with a&#xD;
      multidisciplinary BIDMC team that sends these patients following discharge. This case-control&#xD;
      study seeks to determine if ECHO-CT can improve clinical outcomes and reduce cost and&#xD;
      resource utilization during transitions of care in both an academic (BIDMC Boston) and&#xD;
      community (BIDMC Needham) hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our prospective cohort study of the ECHO-CT intervention will take place in the two&#xD;
      Boston-area hospitals, one providing tertiary care and one community-based care, in which the&#xD;
      outcomes of patients transferred to Skilled Nursing Facilities (SNFs) associated with these&#xD;
      hospitals will be compared to those transferred to SNFs from similar hospitals in New&#xD;
      England. We will also be comparing outcomes from individual patients enrolled in the ECHO&#xD;
      program to matched controls. Using a national database available from the Brown University&#xD;
      Center for Gerontology and Healthcare Research, the outcomes of Medicare beneficiaries&#xD;
      residing in SNFs that are participating in ECHO-CT will be compared to those in the&#xD;
      comparison group using a difference-of-difference analytic approach. Analyses will be&#xD;
      adjusted for potential confounders as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators also plan to measure satisfaction as well as process,&#xD;
      utilization, cost and patient safety outcomes to determine best practices for implementing&#xD;
      the program at a community hospital and affiliated SNFs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be obtained from the following sources:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Protected health information (PHI) from resident assessment data, as well as Medicare&#xD;
           claims and enrollment data to be obtained via a data use agreement (DUA) with the&#xD;
           Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) by the Brown University Center for&#xD;
           Gerontology and Health Care Research during years 2-3 of the study to include the&#xD;
           following:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. The resident Minimum Data Set Resident Assessment (MDS) assessments. The MDS has&#xD;
                nearly 400 data elements including cognitive function, communication/hearing&#xD;
                problems, physical functioning, continence, psycho-social well-being, mood state,&#xD;
                activity and recreation, diagnoses, health conditions, nutritional status,&#xD;
                oral/dental status, skin conditions, special treatments, and medication use. The&#xD;
                assessments are done for all patients admitted to Medicare and Medicaid certified&#xD;
                SNFs, including enrollees in both traditional Medicare and Medicare Advantage.&#xD;
                These data will already be housed at Brown University,Brown has an active DUA to&#xD;
                obtain quarterly pulls of the population of MDS assessments .&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Medicare claims which will be used to ascertain 30-day costs, re-hospitalizations,&#xD;
                and use of other medical services by Medicare fee for service (FFS) patients&#xD;
                admitted to the SNFs. The data also include diagnosis fields to ascertain&#xD;
                comorbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Medicare enrollment file includes demographic information such as sex and race,&#xD;
                dates of birth and death, and various indicators of Medicare/Medicaid eligibility,&#xD;
                Part D eligibility, and Medicare Advantage enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. BIDMC will collect and share ECHO-CT participating patient's social security number&#xD;
                and health insurance claims number with Brown University. Their clinical&#xD;
                information will be matched with control patients from the Medicare claims data to&#xD;
                show study effect on 30-day costs, re-hospitalizations rate and patient length of&#xD;
                stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. In addition to aggregates derived from above, facility level data will come from the&#xD;
           Certification and Survey Provider Enhanced Reporting (CASPER) data, which are publicly&#xD;
           available and based upon facility surveys for Medicare/Medicaid certification. They will&#xD;
           be used in addition to data from &quot;Nursing Home Compare and the Long Term Care: Facts on&#xD;
           Care in the US (LTCFocus.org) websites to describe the SNFs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Intervention-specific data: Project-specific quality improvement data derived from&#xD;
           questionnaires, staff satisfaction surveys, and structured meeting minutes will be&#xD;
           designed and evaluated by BIDMC and Hebrew Senior Life&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. SNF Satisfaction: Every 6 months the investigators will send a satisfaction&#xD;
                questionnaire to the hospitals and SNFs participating in ECHO-CT to assess their&#xD;
                views of the ECHO-CT sessions, the value of time spent, feelings of empowerment,&#xD;
                inter-professional relationships, learning, and recommendations. All answers to the&#xD;
                survey questions will be kept strictly confidential. This information will be used&#xD;
                to improve the content and organization of the sessions and to develop tools for&#xD;
                dissemination (Aim 3). The investigators will develop the satisfaction&#xD;
                questionnaire during the first 6 months of the project, building upon our previous&#xD;
                survey experience and literature review. Metrics to quantify the quality of&#xD;
                transitional care will be derived from the work of Coleman et al.3 and incorporated&#xD;
                into the questionnaire. Survey design and evaluation will be conducted by the&#xD;
                outcome evaluation group under the leadership of Dr. Thomas Travison at Hebrew&#xD;
                SeniorLife's Institute for Aging Research.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Process assessment: The investigators will keep attendance logs to assess adherence&#xD;
                to the ECHO-CT intervention and its changes over time. Any consistent decline in&#xD;
                staff attendance for 2 or more weeks will be followed up by phone calls to assess&#xD;
                barriers to participation and corrective actions will be taken. These may include&#xD;
                changing to a more convenient time, identifying other providers who can attend&#xD;
                instead, contacting facility administrators or medical directors for their support,&#xD;
                and providing incentive gifts or continuing education credits In addition, during&#xD;
                each ECHO-CT session, the hospital based team will inquire about unexpected&#xD;
                outcomes or issues that arose during the transition process, including those&#xD;
                related to patients already discussed. This element will allow for an ongoing&#xD;
                technology-enabled learning platform and continuous quality improvement mechanism&#xD;
                over the course of the proposed project. The value of the video-conferencing&#xD;
                approach is that it creates a mutually trusting learning community in which &quot;all&#xD;
                teach and all learn.&quot;&#xD;
