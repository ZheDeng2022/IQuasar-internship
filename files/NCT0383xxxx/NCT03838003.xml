      An aerobic physical exercise protocol will be applied to patients admitted in ward due to&#xD;
      decompensated heart failure, in order to validate the efficacy and safety of physical&#xD;
      exercise in this phase of clinical stabilization, through the said training protocol - ERIC&#xD;
      program.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With the objective of validating the efficacy and safety of physical exercise as a&#xD;
      therapeutic resource in patients admitted for decompensated heart failure; will be applied,&#xD;
      by rehabilitation nurses, a protocol of physical exercise, with increasing levels of&#xD;
      intensity. Patients who meet the inclusion criteria will be randomized through an online&#xD;
      program (randomizer.org) and the ERIC protocol will be applied to the test group. The control&#xD;
      group will be implemented the usual care of rehabilitation nursing. The ERIC protocol&#xD;
      comprises 5 levels of intensity, as following shown: Stage 1 - respiratory and calisthenic&#xD;
      exercises (5-10 minutes) Stage 2 - pedal for 5-10 minutes Stage 3 - aerobic training: walking&#xD;
      on the corridor for 5-10 minutes Stage 4 - aerobic training: walking on the corridor for&#xD;
      10-15 minutes Stage 5 - aerobic training: walking on the corridor for 15 minutes + climbing&#xD;
      stairs for 5 minutes All patients will be monitored and followed up by a rehabilitation nurse&#xD;
      while they are doing the exercise. The investigator decides, depending on the patient's&#xD;
      performance and clinical conditions, the form of progression in the program, but it is&#xD;
      mandatory to follow the previously defined levels of intensity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the test group may start the program only on stage I or II according to clinical&#xD;
      criteria. At admission of the patients (test group and control group) clinical and&#xD;
      sociodemographic parameters are evaluated, as well as data related to Barthel's indices and&#xD;
      London Chest of activities of daily living (LCADL). At the discharge date, the Barthel index&#xD;
      and the LCADL scale will also be evaluated, as well as the 6-minute walking test.&#xD;
