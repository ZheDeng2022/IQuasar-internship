  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol will test the hypothesis that Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is&#xD;
      effective in reducing anxiety and depressive symptoms during the perinatal and postpartum&#xD;
      periods. Participants should expect their participation in the study to last 9-12 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study's major theme is &quot;to examine the efficacy of a brief Acceptance and Commitment&#xD;
      Therapy (ACT) intervention in treating perinatal anxiety symptoms, as compared to a&#xD;
      supportive control condition.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      The perinatal and postpartum periods are known to be a vulnerable time for the development of&#xD;
      mental health symptomatology, with approximately 7% of women developing postpartum depression&#xD;
      in the first three months following childbirth. One known predictor of postpartum depression&#xD;
      is perinatal anxiety and distress. The impact of postpartum depression extends beyond the&#xD;
      mother, whose distress and daily functioning are affected, with adverse effects on infant&#xD;
      development and care. The need for interventions and preventive interventions has been widely&#xD;
      indicated for over two decades.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol will describe two conditions, the effects of which will be contrasted to&#xD;
      determine the efficacy of ACT in treating anxiety and depressive symptoms among perinatal&#xD;
      women. The ACT condition will be compared to a supportive psychoeducation intervention. The&#xD;
      effects of the intervention will be determined in terms of self-report measures (anxiety and&#xD;
      depressive symptoms, flexibility, mindfulness, social satisfaction) and diagnostic interviews&#xD;
      (depression, anxiety). The impact of trauma history and psychodiagnostic history will be&#xD;
      examined as moderating factors and/or covariates in the examination of the intervention's&#xD;
      efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol will test the hypothesis that ACT is effective in reducing anxiety and&#xD;
      depressive symptoms during the perinatal and postpartum periods. Second, the investigators&#xD;
      will examine the intergenerational impact of the intervention on the offspring via offspring&#xD;
      birth outcomes, as reported in the electronic medical record. Finally, the investigators will&#xD;
      explore mediators and moderators of the treatment outcomes. This work will advance the&#xD;
      understanding of the impact of brief interventions on perinatal well-being and improve the&#xD;
      ability to disseminate empirically supported interventions for pregnant mothers.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 month</time_frame>
    <description>This assessment is a 39-item measure where the scale is from 1 (never or rarely true) to 5 (very often or always true). FFMQ measures five facets of mindfulness with respect to one's own experience: observing (8 items), describing (8 items), acting with (8 items), non-judging (8 items), and non-reacting (7 items).</description>

    <measure>Change in Acceptance and Action Questionnaire (AAQ-2) from Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 month</time_frame>
    <description>AAQ-2 will be used to measure psychological inflexibility, avoidance behavior, and maladaptive coping. This is a 7 item measure with a scale of 1 (never true) to 7 (always true). Lower scores indicate lesser experiential avoidance.</description>

    <description>Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) - participants in this arm will take part in an online ACT + psychoeducation intervention. The intervention will provide psychoeducation surrounding perinatal anxiety and depression as well as on engaging social support and coping strategies. The ACT portion of the intervention will focus on developing psychological flexibility, which is defined as behaviorally pursuing one's values even in the presence of barriers (e.g., thoughts, emotions). Following the online intervention, the participants will be contacted for two phone coaching calls -- each lasting about 30-45 minutes.</description>
