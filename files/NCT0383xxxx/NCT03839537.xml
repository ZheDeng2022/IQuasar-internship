      Brief Summary Short description of the protocol intended for the lay public. Include a brief&#xD;
      statement of the study hypothesis. (Limit: 5000 characters)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Example: The purpose of this study is to determine whether prednisone, methotrexate, and&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide are effective in the treatment of rapidly progressive hearing loss in both&#xD;
      ears due to autoimmune inner ear disease (AIED). This project is part of a research field on&#xD;
      the role, not yet fully understood, of atmospheric pollution, especially from road traffic,&#xD;
      on respiratory health and allergies, particularly on the development / onset of symptoms and&#xD;
      functional disturbances. The ultrafine fraction of particles (UFPs - particles smaller than&#xD;
      100 nm in diameter) is of recent interest because of their ability to induce inflammatory&#xD;
      effects, oxidative stress and may contribute to the exacerbation of asthma symptoms in&#xD;
      susceptible individuals. UFPs, with their high number concentration and surface area and&#xD;
      their small diameter are able not only to convey other contaminants, but also to contribute&#xD;
      to a high deposition efficiency, into the alveoli in the lungs. Recently it appeared relevant&#xD;
      to be interested in black carbon (BC), components of PM2.5 (particulate matter with a&#xD;
      diameter less than 2.5 micrometers), suspected of being responsible for their toxicity.&#xD;
      Current epidemiological knowledge of the effects of UFPs and BC are few as compared to those&#xD;
      on fine particles. Some professionals, such as police, drivers (taxis, truckers ...),&#xD;
      delivery men, postal workers, workers on roads and highways, etc. are heavily exposed, during&#xD;
      their working hours, to air pollution due to road traffic. These occupational groups appear&#xD;
      to be at greater risk for developing respiratory, cardiovascular and neurological diseases&#xD;
      than the general population. Occupational exposure to diesel exhaust has been associated with&#xD;
      an increased risk of lung cancer mortality and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.&#xD;
      Occupational exposure to UFPs and BC has rarely been measured due to a lack of suitable&#xD;
      devices. Therefore, this project's originality consists in measuring UFPs and BC by using&#xD;
      portable devices developed in the recent years. The use of these devices, linking their&#xD;
      recordings with ventilatory measures and repeating them, offers the rare opportunity to study&#xD;
      the short-term respiratory health impact of this occupational exposure, which has never been&#xD;
      described in the literature. Our research aims to: 1/ quantify the occupational exposure of&#xD;
      taxi drivers to UFP, BC, oxides of carbon (CO, CO2) and to nitrogen dioxide (NO2), 2/&#xD;
      identify spatio-temporal variability and patterns of exposure related to occupational tasks,&#xD;
      3/ study the impact of this occupational exposure to UFP and BC on ventilation performances&#xD;
      and respiratory symptoms.&#xD;

      The study is based on a random sampling of 100 taxi drivers, working full-time day shift, in&#xD;
      Paris, members of three Trade Unions. It will be conducted over a period of two years in warm&#xD;
      and cold season. The research will begin with an inclusion clinical examination. It consists&#xD;
      on determining the overall health status of the participants by administering a standardized&#xD;
      questionnaire and performing spirometry test, prick test and FENO measurement. The exposure&#xD;
      assessment will be based on continuous measurement of UFP, BC, carbon monoxide (CO) and NO2,&#xD;
      by portable devices during a working day (± 11 hours). On the same day, two spirometry tests&#xD;
      and two measurements of exhaled carbon monoxide will be performed at the beginning and at the&#xD;
      end of the shift, using handheld devices. Multivariate analysis will provide spatio-temporal&#xD;
      distributions of individual exposures and their determinants. Generalized Estimating&#xD;
      Equations (GEE) multivariate models will be used to determine the relation between exposure&#xD;
      (UFP, BC) and respiratory symptoms, ventilation performances, adjusting for potential&#xD;
      confounding/modifying factors.&#xD;
