  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess the use of a wound dressing system called PICO7Y&#xD;
      following a two-sided breast surgery. PICO7Y is a new dressing system made to treat two&#xD;
      incisions/wounds at the same time, and the purpose of this study is to check how the dressing&#xD;
      is working by looking at data on how well the dressing performs while you wear it and to&#xD;
      check if doctors and patients are happy with it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PICO7Y is based on another dressing called PICO.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      It is thought that Negative Pressure Wound Therapy may have numerous mechanisms of action&#xD;
      when used to manage surgical incisions, including reducing oedema, stimulating perfusion and&#xD;
      managing exudate. Post-operative oedema in the peri-wound tissue is thought to limit tissue&#xD;
      perfusion and high levels of wound fluid loss have been correlated with increased risk of&#xD;
      post-operative infection and dehiscence23. Application of NPWT to the closed wound has been&#xD;
      reported to improve patient comfort through reduced dressing changes and to lessen the period&#xD;
      during which post-operative fluid discharges from the incision. Xia et al (2014)24&#xD;
      demonstrated that in 20 patients with infected wounds, NPWT resulted in significantly&#xD;
      increased blood flow in the wounds when compared to pre application levels. In a study by&#xD;
      Young et al (2013)25 four patients with pressure ulcers had oedema and wound bed thickness&#xD;
      assessed during follow-up. They demonstrated a rapid reduction of peri-wound tissue oedema&#xD;
      over four days and a 20% increase in the thickness of the wound bed by seven days of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk factors such as smoking and obesity have shown to increase complications follow&#xD;
      oncoplastic surgery26 and it is possible that such populations could benefit more from the&#xD;
      application of the NPWT. Furthermore there are a number of bilateral or multi wound&#xD;
      indications where provision of a single device with the Y connection may represent a cost&#xD;
      saving to the healthcare system. However, ultimately the use of NPWT for oncoplastic breast&#xD;
      surgery closed incisions will be judged on whether it can increase the healing success rate&#xD;
      while minimising complications. Holt and Murphy (2015)27 assessed the use of PICO single use&#xD;
      NPWT system when applied to 24 patients with closed incisions following therapeutic&#xD;
      resection. The contralateral breast underwent simultaneous symmetrising breast reduction with&#xD;
      standard care dressings applied allowing for direct comparison. Although the cohort was too&#xD;
      small to draw meaningful statistical conclusions they noted a lower incidence of wound&#xD;
      breakdown (4.2% vs. 16.7%) and shorter time to healing (10.7 days vs. 16.1 days) in the NPWT&#xD;
      group. However, this difference was partly attributed to the more extensive and complex&#xD;
      nature of the therapeutic surgery. Similarly in a category of patients undergoing breast&#xD;
      surgery with primary wound closure, Pellino et al (2014)19 showed significantly lower&#xD;
      surgical site events when treated with PICO.&#xD;

    <description>The PICO 7Y pump maintains NPWT at -80 mmHg (nominal) to two wound surfaces simultaneously. Exudate is managed by the dressings through a combination of absorption and evaporation of moisture through the outer film. The PICO 7Y kit is intended to be used for up to 7 days on low exuding wounds. For moderately exuding wounds the system is intended to be used for up to 4 days without a dressing change. For 7 days use on moderately exuding wounds additional dressings will be supplied.</description>
