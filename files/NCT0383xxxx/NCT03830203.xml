  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, multicenter, multinational, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group,&#xD;
      active-control study to compare efficacy, safety, immunogenicity, and PK of BAT1806 compared&#xD;
      with RoActemra in subjects with RA that is inadequately controlled by MTX.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is composed of a ≤ 28-day screening period, a 24-week initial treatment period&#xD;
      (TP1), a 24 week secondary treatment period (TP2), and an extra 4-week follow-up period.&#xD;

             on the medical history record.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject presents with active RA, as defined by:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               2. ≥ 6 out of 66 swollen joints (at screening and randomization) AND&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) &gt; upper limit of normal (ULN) value or erythrocyte&#xD;
                  sedimentation rate (ESR) ≥ 28 mm/hour at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects are eligible if they have received not more than 2 biological agents other&#xD;
             than interleukin-6 inhibitors or targeted synthetic DMARDs (eg, tofacitinib) in total&#xD;
             for RA treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Female subjects of childbearing potential and male subjects with a female partner of&#xD;
             childbearing potential must be willing to take reliable contraceptive precautions&#xD;
