  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sensory Over-Responsivity (SOR) is characterized by a disruption in regulating sensory&#xD;
      stimuli and can significantly impact pain perception and restrict daily participation and&#xD;
      quality of life. Altered neurophysiological processes in SOR are documented, revealing&#xD;
      reduced electroencephalogram at rest and P300 amplitudes, the latter tested through&#xD;
      event-related potentials (ERP). Both may explain the failure to regulate incoming sensory&#xD;
      stimuli. Neurofeedback (NF) therapy, a remedial treatment approach, aims at self-regulating&#xD;
      the brain's neural activity and has proven its efficiency in treating comorbid SMD syndromes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study aims to investigate NF therapy efficiency in decreasing pain sensitivity, enhancing&#xD;
      auditory ERP components of P300, increasing the power of the alpha band, life-satisfaction&#xD;
      and Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS) scores in adults with SOR.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this serial experimental research design, 10 individuals with SOR aged 21-45 years will&#xD;
      participate. A medical and demographic questionnaire and the Sensory Responsiveness&#xD;
      Questionnaire-Intensity Scale (SRQ-IS) will be applied to screen for participation&#xD;
      eligibility. Outcome measures will be conducted at 4-time points (1. baseline- 3 weeks&#xD;
      pre-treatment; 2. before the first treatment session; 3. after the last treatment session;&#xD;
      and 4. a month post-treatment) applying: The Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS), the P300&#xD;
      component using a neurophysiological assessment of the 'Oddball paradigm', the alpha power&#xD;
      using electroencephalogram resting state, and electronic versions of the Satisfaction with&#xD;
      Life Scale, the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule, and the Pain&#xD;
      Sensitivity Questionnaire. Sixteen individually therapy sessions of 45 minutes each, twice a&#xD;
      week, will be held at the same time of day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repeated measures ANOVA or a non-parametric equivalent will be used to analyze the dependent&#xD;
      variables measures change over time.&#xD;
