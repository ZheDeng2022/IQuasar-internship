  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Complaints about memory loss are very common in women in the menopausal transition period.&#xD;
      The effectiveness of estrogen replacement therapy in cognitive improvement is controversial.&#xD;
      Partial positive results were obtained in some studies with regard to memory improvement, so&#xD;
      far no standard treatment considered effective in these cases. Effective pharmacological&#xD;
      approaches to the treatment of memory loss associated with menopause are an unmet medical&#xD;
      need. Cogmax® is a multivitamin and mineral supplement that contains numerous key elements&#xD;
      for cognitive function, and may be a safe therapeutic option in these cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The multicenter, non-comparative (single-arm) phase IV clinical trial will be conducted with&#xD;
      80 female participants aged 45 to 60 years and menopausal memory loss complaint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 3 months of using multivitamin and mineral supplement, memory and attention will be&#xD;
      reevaluated through specific questionnaire and the Stroop Test Victoria version.&#xD;

      This multicenter, non-comparative phase IV clinical trial will be conducted at brazilian&#xD;
      clinical trial centers under the auspices of Eurofarma Laboratories S.A. Recruitment for the&#xD;
      study will begin after the relevant ethical and regulatory approvals and will have an&#xD;
      estimated duration of 4 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include 80 female participants aged between 45 and 60 years and menopausal&#xD;
      memory complaints who consent to participate in the study by signing the informed consent&#xD;
      form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To be included, participants must meet all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion&#xD;
      criteria. Each participant will initially complete a selection period with a maximum duration&#xD;
      of 14 days for evaluation of eligibility. Participants will then be treated with Cogmax® in&#xD;
      the dosage of two capsules per day for 12 weeks.&#xD;

    <description>The short version of Meta-memory in Adulthood Questionnaire is composed of 39 multiple-choice statements that are answered in a five-point likert scale, evaluating seven factors of meta-memory (strategy, task, capacity, change, anxiety, achievement and locus).&#xD;

The arithmetic average on the domains capacity, control and change range from 1 (worse) to 5 (better).</description>
