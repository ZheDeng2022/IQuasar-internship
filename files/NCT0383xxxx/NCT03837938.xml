      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the efficacy of Levopront® in comparison with Libexin® based on daytime cough&#xD;
      resolution rate by Day 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The daytime cough symptoms resolution corresponds to 0 or 1 points on the &quot;Six-point daytime&#xD;
      and nighttime cough assessment scale&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment effect assessment in terms of the following efficacy and safety parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the efficacy of Levopront® in comparison with Libexin® based on nighttime&#xD;
           cough resolution rate by Day 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Daytime and nighttime cough symptoms resolution according to &quot;Six-point daytime and&#xD;
           nighttime cough assessment scale&quot; by Day 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in severity and frequency of daytime and nighttime cough according to &quot;Six-point&#xD;
           daytime and nighttime cough assessment scale&quot; on Day 4 and Day 8 from baseline on Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cough intensity change according to the visual-analogue scale on Day 4 and Day 8 from&#xD;
           baseline on Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change of FEV1 on Day 8 from baseline values on Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rate of Adverse events (AE) and Serious Adverse Events (SAE) of the various severity&#xD;
           according to subjective complaints, laboratory test results, physical examination, vital&#xD;
           signs and spirometry&#xD;
