  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bronchiolitis (BQ) is the acute viral infection of the tract respiratory syndrome in infants&#xD;
      that affects the bronchioles of babies under 24 months of age. Respiratory physiotherapy (RF)&#xD;
      appears as a treatment measure complementary in the clinical guidelines and consensus on the&#xD;
      management of the BQ.&#xD;

      Once each patient legal guardians has signed the informed consent document and it has been&#xD;
      verified that the inclusion criteria are met, it will be assigned the same identification&#xD;
      number (ID) that is related to its Clinical History (CH) by simple coding; custody of the&#xD;
      file with the relationship of each ID with its CH will be the responsibility of the principal&#xD;
      investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assignment will be made at the time of query according to a table of random numbers&#xD;
      previously established and that it will only be known by physiotherapists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before starting the treatment protocol, a blind evaluator who does not know the treatment to&#xD;
      which the patient is assigned, classifies the child according to the initial score of&#xD;
      clinical severity proposed by Wang, in addition to the measurement of SO2 and frequency heart&#xD;
      rate through a pulse oximeter. The measurement of the amount of sputum collected in a meter&#xD;
      measuring cup, once the respiratory physiotherapy session is finished, it will be done in a&#xD;
      calibrated weight in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol in the manual maneuvers group consists of 20 minutes of FR based on prolonged&#xD;
      slow expiration and coughing provoked. Is apassive technique of expiratory help applied to&#xD;
      the baby through a slow thoracic-abdominal pressure that begins at the end of spontaneous&#xD;
      expiration and continues to the residual volume. The physiotherapist through the cough&#xD;
      provoked or stimulation of the trachea gets expectoration of sputum, to be able to assess its&#xD;
      weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol in the high frequency compression chest wall group consists of the same protocol&#xD;
      as the respiratory physiotherapy Group plus high frequency compression chest wall applied&#xD;
      with Smart Vest® device, with a fixed frequency of 13 Hz and a time 15 min. The selected mode&#xD;
      will be the normal (fixed parameters) and the pressure of 4 units (12 cm H2O). The patient&#xD;
      remains seated on his parents, and with a cotton garment between the vest and the skin of the&#xD;
      patient to prevent skin lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Attention must be paid during maneuvers to maintain a position of infant in supine decubitus&#xD;
      in 30 degrees of slope, to avoid episodes of gastroesophageal reflux and decrease the risk of&#xD;
      vomiting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for cessation of physiotherapeutic intervention, alterations will be considered&#xD;
      abrupt of the respiratory rhythm (brady or tachypnea), stare, ocular revulsion, hiccups or&#xD;
      hypertonia and changes in skin color (pallor or cyanosis). In addition to these&#xD;
      manifestations clinics, it is established that if the parent or legal guardian so requires,&#xD;
      the the application of the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 10 and 20 minutes of finishing both groups, the doctor again makes a measurement of&#xD;
      mucus volume, SO2, heart and respiratory rate, and classify again according to the criteria&#xD;
      of Wang's clinical severity scale.&#xD;
