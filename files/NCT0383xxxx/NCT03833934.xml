  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ALK-positive lung cancer is a subtype of lung cancer which carries a change in a gene called&#xD;
      ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase). There are now many drugs for patients with ALK-positive&#xD;
      lung cancer that slow cancer growth. However, after some time, just as bacteria evolve&#xD;
      resistance to antibiotics, ALK-positive lung cancers evolve ways to avoid the therapies by&#xD;
      developing new mutations so the drugs lost their effectiveness. These new mutations can&#xD;
      potentially be treated with a different drug. For these new therapies, the range of mutations&#xD;
      that can develop at resistance is not well understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is now possible to detect the presence of mutations or changes in the genetic structure in&#xD;
      lung cancer by analyzing a patient's blood for bits of material shed by tumor. This approach&#xD;
      is often called a liquid biopsy. Recently, researchers have shown that looking at tumor&#xD;
      molecules through liquid biopsies can provide doctors with some of the same information that&#xD;
      tissue biopsies provide. For example, liquid biopsies can be used to detect mutations that&#xD;
      cause drug resistance. Obtaining liquid biopsies on patients with ALK-positive lung cancers&#xD;
      at resistance to therapy may help better understand the different mutations that develop and&#xD;
      guide therapy decisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, a blood specimen will be collected and submitted for liquid biopsy&#xD;
      analysis at a commercial diagnostic company. This company specializes in analyzing tumor&#xD;
      material found in blood. Specifically, it will look for genetic changes in the ALK gene that&#xD;
      could help understand why a cancer has developed drug resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study is for lung cancer patients with ALK-positive lung cancer who had been on&#xD;
      a newer ALK targeted treatment (such as ceritinib, alectinib, brigatinib, or lorlatinib) to&#xD;
      determine whether they have developed ALK resistance mutations. The investigators will&#xD;
      collect a blood sample to examine these mutations. Participants will not have to have a&#xD;
      tissue biopsy to participate in this study. Participants do not have to visit Dana-Farber&#xD;
      Cancer Institute (DFCI) to participate. All study procedures will be performed remotely.&#xD;

      SPACEWALK is an innovative remote consent and participation study using next-generation&#xD;
      sequencing (NGS) of plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) to characterize resistance mechanisms&#xD;
      arising in ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after progression while on a next&#xD;
      generation ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). Additionally, the study will capture the&#xD;
      potential of genomic-driven resistance therapy approach for effecting outcomes in patients&#xD;
      with advanced ALK-positive NSCLC and TKI resistance. Finally, the study will assess the role&#xD;
      of repeat plasma NGS in evaluating drug response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will accrue patients with advanced ALK-positive NSCLC on systemic progression&#xD;
      (outside the brain) while on treatment with a next-generation ALK TKI. Any patient interested&#xD;
      in the study will find information about the study on the study website. The patient will&#xD;
      consent remotely through the study website and documentation of advanced ALK-positive NSCLC&#xD;
      and systemic progression while on a next-generation ALK TKI. The study team will then reach&#xD;
      out to the patient to confirm eligibility and send a blood collection kit. In the study kit&#xD;
      the study participants will find all the necessary materials for local blood draws and&#xD;
      collected specimens will be sent directly to the central study laboratory (Resolution&#xD;
      Bioscience) for plasma NGS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma NGS of cfDNA will involve sequencing of 19 genes, including ALK, permitting remote&#xD;
      tumor genotyping. Plasma NGS analysis and results will be done following standard procedures&#xD;
      of the Resolution Bioscience CLIA-certified laboratory. Results will take 1-2 weeks to be&#xD;
      sent back to study participants, their physicians and study team. Those plasma NGS reports&#xD;
      will not include any specific treatment recommendations but will describe the presence of an&#xD;
      ALK rearrangement, ALK resistance mutation, or other relevant mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants are then followed remotely. The study coordinator will contact the&#xD;
      participants weekly for 4 weeks after enrolled into the study to learn of any new treatment&#xD;
      initiation and to release an additional plasma collection kit 2-4 weeks after starting&#xD;
      treatment. Study participants will then be remotely contacted every 3 months to follow&#xD;
      clinical outcomes on therapy for up to 2 years. If the cancer begins to grow again on the&#xD;
      participant's new treatment, the patient will have the option to provide a third blood&#xD;
      specimen. Medical records and local imaging will be collected and studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to characterize ALK TKI resistance to next-generation&#xD;
      ALK TKIs in patients with advanced ALK-positive NSCLC. Secondarily, the investigators will&#xD;
      assess the potential of plasma NGS to impact outcome on treatment by studying time to&#xD;
      treatment discontinuation (TTD). Serial plasma NGS will also be assessed as a response&#xD;
      biomarker. A total of 300 patients will be enrolled, with the expectation that approximately&#xD;
      200 will have tumor-related mutations detected in plasma NGS.&#xD;

      Blood specimens will be tested for genetic mutations in ALK and other genes that may be&#xD;
      important for lung cancer. The participant and their doctor will receive a copy of the test&#xD;
      results. The test results will describe the gene alterations that are detected in the blood&#xD;
      sample. The assay covers a region of the ALK gene and other lung cancer genes where&#xD;
      resistance alterations can occur.&#xD;
