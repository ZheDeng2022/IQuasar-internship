  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to find out if the combination of CC-122 (an investigational agent) and&#xD;
      Nivolumab will enhance the anti-cancer activity and prevent T-cell exhaustion (T-cells are&#xD;
      responsible for maintaining the body's immune response).&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unresectable or metastatic melanoma of cutaneous, mucosal, conjunctival, or unknown&#xD;
             origin. Uveal melanoma is not permitted. Cohort 1: Na√Øve to anti-PD1 therapy Cohort 2:&#xD;
             Progressed on previous anti-PD1 therapy. Subjects who have received anti-PD1 therapy&#xD;
             in the adjuvant setting for previously resected melanoma are eligible for this cohort&#xD;
             provided they have not received any intervening systemic therapy for the relapse&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be willing and able to provide written informed consent for the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have measurable disease based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)&#xD;
             version 1.1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test&#xD;
             within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females of childbearing potential should be willing to use 2 methods of birth control&#xD;
             or be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course of the&#xD;
             study 28 days after last dose of avadomide or 5 months after the last dose of&#xD;
             nivolumab, whichever is longer. Females of childbearing potential are those who have&#xD;
             not been surgically sterilized or have not been free from menses for &gt;1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Males should agree to use an adequate method of contraception starting with the first&#xD;
             dose of study therapy through 3 months after the last dose of avadomide or 7 months&#xD;
             after last dose of nivolumab, whichever is longer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate organ function&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has received an investigational drug or other anti-cancer therapy within 3 weeks of&#xD;
             the first dose of treatment or &lt; 5 half-lives of that agent, whichever is shorter. Any&#xD;
             toxicity from prior therapy must have recovered to &lt; grade 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any&#xD;
             other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of trial&#xD;
             treatment (only exception to this is the need for steroids for CNS metastases; see #6&#xD;
             below). Inhaled, intra-articular, or topical steroids are permissible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a history of hypersensitivity to nivolumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment,&#xD;
             the lack of which would pose a risk to the health of the subject, in the opinion of&#xD;
             the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has known symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous&#xD;
             meningitis. Subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided&#xD;
             they are stable without evidence of progression by imaging for at least four weeks&#xD;
             after definitive intervention and using no more than the equivalent of dexamethasone&#xD;
             2mg/d for the management of vasogenic edema, if necessary. This exception does not&#xD;
             include carcinomatous meningitis, which is excluded regardless of clinical stability.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years&#xD;
             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive&#xD;
             drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid&#xD;
             replacement therapy [&lt;/= 10 mg/d equivalent of prednisone] for adrenal or pituitary&#xD;
             insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment. Patients with&#xD;
             previous grade III/IV toxicity from immunotherapy that led to treatment&#xD;
             discontinuation are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with&#xD;
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial, in the opinion of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Is pregnant or breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), active Hepatitis B or&#xD;
             Hepatitis C.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy. Note:&#xD;
             Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and&#xD;
             are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist¬Æ) are live&#xD;
             attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed&#xD;
