    <measure>Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of zilovertamab vedotin</measure>
    <time_frame>Cycle 1 (Up to 21 Days)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will receive zilovertamab vedotin according to Schedule 1, 2, or 3. The MTD will be determined by the number of participants who experience a dose limiting toxicity (DLT). The MTD will be defined as the highest tested dose level at which ≥6 participants have been treated and which is associated with a Cycle 1 DLT in ≤17% of the participants.</description>

    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a medicinal product; the event does not necessarily have a causal relationship with study drug administration or usage. Laboratory abnormalities, vital sign/oxygen saturation abnormalities, and adverse electrocardiogram (ECG) findings will also be recorded as AEs. A TEAE is defined as an AE that occurs or worsens in the period from the first dose of study drug administration to 30 days after the final dose of study drug administration. The number of participants with a TEAE will be reported for each arm.</description>

Failure to recover to baseline by ≥21 days from the last dose of study drug in the current cycle due to a drug-related TEAE is also considered a DLT. The number of participants with a DLT will be reported for each arm.</description>
