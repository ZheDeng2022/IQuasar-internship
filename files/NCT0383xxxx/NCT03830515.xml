      In this study, total of 20 subjects will have lacerations will be closed with microMend,&#xD;
      which is an FDA-listed wound closure product. microMend is a wound closure device that is the&#xD;
      size and shape of a butterfly bandage and incorporates tiny Microstaples into an adhesive&#xD;
      backing. Assessments by practitioners and Subjects of microMend will be made at Days 0 10,&#xD;
      and 3 months using a combination of questionnaires and photographs.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-arm Phase 2 Study to evaluate closure of skin wounds associated&#xD;
      with laceration repair using microMend devices. A maximum of 20 Subjects will be enrolled in&#xD;
      the Study in order to have 15 Subjects with evaluations at Month 3 after wound closure. The&#xD;
      primary intent is to assess the wound closure results with microMend closure at Month 3 after&#xD;
      the wound closure procedure. Evaluations will also take place at Days 0 and 10 and 1 Month&#xD;
      post-procedure to assess wound closure results. An Independent Plastic Surgeon who is not&#xD;
      closing wounds in the study will assess the efficacy of wound closure at Day 10, Month 1, and&#xD;
      Month 3. Assessment will also be made of the Subject's pain with applying microMend, time of&#xD;
      wound closure, and opinions of the Providers and Subjects about microMend.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening data will be reviewed to determine Subject eligibility. Subjects who meet all&#xD;
      inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be entered into the Study. The&#xD;
      Provider may elect to close additional wounds in subjects who have more than one wound that&#xD;
      qualifies for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Study, eligible Subjects will undergo the laceration repair procedure as is standard&#xD;
      and customary for each Provider except for skin closure will be performed using microMend&#xD;
      devices. If more than one device is needed, the devices are to be applied adjacent to one&#xD;
      another along the entire length of the wound. microMend devices are to be applied immediately&#xD;
      adjacent to one another with no more than 1 mm separating each adjacent device. (Note: Each&#xD;
      device closes 1-1.5 cm of wound length.). In addition, devices should be applied such that&#xD;
      they extend to or beyond the ends of the wound along its length.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A minimum of two (2) photographs will be taken of each wound both before and after the&#xD;
      application of microMend devices on the day of the wound closure procedure (Day 0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a wound is under high tension and/or has a maximum gap of more than 1 cm between the wound&#xD;
      edges, it should be closed with subcutaneous sutures before applying microMend devices. If&#xD;
      this is not performed, the wound should not be closed with microMend and the Subject is not&#xD;
      eligible for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard surgical staples, sutures, tissue adhesives, SteriStrips or other bandages should&#xD;
      not be used to close any portion of skin wounds closed with microMend devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each wound should be free of significant tissue injury and bleeding, contain no foreign&#xD;
      bodies, and should be clean and completely dry and free of hair before application of&#xD;
      microMend.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No other wound closure products, such as tissue adhesives, bandages such as SteriStrips,&#xD;
      staples, or sutures should be applied to the wound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Solutions, ointments, creams, and other moist materials should be avoided during the time&#xD;
      period when the microMend remains on the skin except those recommended by the Provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After application of the microMend devices, it is recommended that each wound be covered with&#xD;
      a non-stick gauze dressing. (Note: contact of adhesive with microMend devices is strictly&#xD;
      prohibited.) Subject contact with the wound site should be minimized after placement of the&#xD;
      microMend devices and the dressing. All other activities associated with the laceration&#xD;
      repair procedure should follow the standard procedure used by the Provider. The Provider will&#xD;
      fill out a questionnaire about the wound closure procedure. The Subject will rate the level&#xD;
      of pain associated with microMend application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The microMend devices are to be removed at the return clinic visit on Day 10 (acceptable&#xD;
      range: Days 7-12) by the Provider (Physician, Nurse Practitioner, Physician's Assistant, or&#xD;
      other qualified health care provider). Photographs are to be obtained of each wound both&#xD;
      before and after removal of all microMend devices. A minimum of two (2) photographs will be&#xD;
      taken of each wound both before and after removal of microMend devices. The Subject will fill&#xD;
      out a questionnaire providing an opinion of microMend.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each Subject is to return to the clinic at one (1) month post-procedure (acceptable range:&#xD;
      Days 25-40) to obtain photographs of each wound. A minimum of two (2) photographs will be&#xD;
      taken at the 1-month clinic visit. Each Subject is to return to the clinic at three (3)&#xD;
      months after wound closure (acceptable range: 11-15 weeks) to obtain photographs of each&#xD;
      wound. A minimum of two (2) photographs will be taken at the 1-month clinic visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Photographs obtained on Day 0, Day 10, Month 1, and Month 3 will be assessed for wound&#xD;
      closure results by an Independent Plastic Surgeon, who is not performing laceration repair or&#xD;
      wound closure in the study. The wound closure will be rated as either Satisfactory or&#xD;
      Unsatisfactory. The quality of the wound closure will further be rated as Excellent, Good,&#xD;
      Fair, or Poor. For Subjects that have had more than one wound closed with microMend devices,&#xD;
      each wound is to be assessed separately at Day 0, Day 10, Month 1, and Month 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total duration of Subject participation will be approximately 4 months, including screening,&#xD;
      treatment, and follow-up.&#xD;
