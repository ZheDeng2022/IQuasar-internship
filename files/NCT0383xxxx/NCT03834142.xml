  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current opioid epidemic has led to a renewed interest in exploring non-pharmacological&#xD;
      techniques to treat post-operative pain. An increasing number of patients are suffering from&#xD;
      the adverse effects of opioid use following surgery, including post-operative nausea and&#xD;
      vomiting, respiratory depression, immunosuppression, constipation, and most recently,&#xD;
      addiction. In the United States, over $600 billion is spent every year on opioid addiction,&#xD;
      including $79 billion related to opioid addiction following surgery. Despite many initiatives&#xD;
      to decrease the use of opiates in the preoperative setting, opioids continue to be regularly&#xD;
      prescribed before, during and after surgery. Although the risk of opioid addiction following&#xD;
      surgery is recognized, the percentage of patients becoming addicted to opioids following&#xD;
      surgery is not well understood. To date, there has been virtually no agreement regarding the&#xD;
      duration and dosage that qualify for opioid dependence following surgery, nor that a clear&#xD;
      estimation of the factors such as biological, psychosocial and socioeconomic that increase&#xD;
      the risk of using opioids for extended periods of time after surgery. Therefore, in order to&#xD;
      combat this growing health crisis at the ground level, it is incumbent upon the medical&#xD;
      community to explore alternative methods of pain control to treat the surgical population in&#xD;
      order to change the incidence of post-operative opioid addiction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Percutaneous Nerve Field Stimulation (PNFS) is one of these recognized methods that ongoing&#xD;
      research has shown to be effective as a complementary method of pain management. While PNFS&#xD;
      is not a novel concept, clinical indications of auricular field stimulation have been limited&#xD;
      in the past due to requirement of bulky, stationary and non-disposable stimulators and&#xD;
      electrodes. These technological limitations made it difficult to establish the real clinical&#xD;
      potential of auricular stimulation for the perioperative management of pain in surgical&#xD;
      patients, despite the demonstration that auriculotherapy has been shown to relieve pain in&#xD;
      the postoperative setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NSS-2- BRIDGE is a battery operated and disposable percutaneous auricular nerve field&#xD;
      stimulator (Innovative Health Solutions, Versailles, IN, USA), that was recently cleared by&#xD;
      the FDA and assigned a Class II Risk Designation; a class which includes surgical drapes,&#xD;
      pumps and power wheelchairs. The indication for the NSS-2 BRIDGE is for the treatment of&#xD;
      clinical symptoms related to opioid consumption and opioid withdrawal. These symptoms include&#xD;
      pain, anxiety and post-operative nausea and vomiting; conditions which are also present&#xD;
      following major orthopedic surgery such as knee and hip arthroplasties. The use of the NSS-2&#xD;
      BRIDGE device has been demonstrated to provide significant analgesia in patients with&#xD;
      abdominal pain syndrome, and clinical trials are ongoing to assess the benefit of this&#xD;
      approach for post-operative pain management. As compared to the present use of opioids for&#xD;
      perioperative pain management, the use of a complementary, non-pharmacologic approach offers&#xD;
      the advantage of analgesia without the associated side effects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An open-label, pilot study will investigate forty individuals, ten of which will be scheduled&#xD;
      for total hip arthroplasty, ten will be scheduled for total knee arthroplasty, ten scheduled&#xD;
      for kidney transplant and ten for bariatric surgery, will be approached and consented for&#xD;
      this trial. Their data in regards to their post-operative pain, nausea, and analgesia use&#xD;
      will be compared to 10 historic subjects who had the same surgeries in January (TKA/THA) or&#xD;
      September (kidney transplant/bariatric) of 2019. The subjects who receive the NSS-2-BRIDGE&#xD;
      will also be monitored for comfort with the device for the tolerability and feasibility of&#xD;
      utilizing this device in the future to treat post-operative pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a patient has given and signed informed consent to participate in the study, demographic&#xD;
      information and medical history will be collected from each participant on the day of the&#xD;
      joint replacement/kidney transplant/bariatric surgery. Data will be de-identified and kept in&#xD;
      a locked cabinet in a locked office. The PI and the research coordinator have been trained in&#xD;
      placing the NSS-2-BRIDGE and will apply the device in the immediate post-operative setting&#xD;
      (post-anesthesia care unit, PACU). The device will be attached behind the ear with&#xD;
      double-sided tape. It contains three electrodes which will be applied to the ear and a ground&#xD;
      which will be placed on the patient's lobe. Each electrode and the ground will be secured&#xD;
      with adhesive bandages. The patient will be informed at the time of consent and after the&#xD;
      implantation of the device that they can have the device removed any time after its&#xD;
      application. Once the device is placed patients will be asked to perform a &quot;pinch test&quot;&#xD;
      throughout the duration of their time wearing the device. To perform the &quot;pinch test&quot; they&#xD;
      must pinch down on the electrodes and ground to ensure they are still placed in their&#xD;
      designated locations and have not come loose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As per standard of care, at 24, 48, 72, 96 and 120 hours post-operatively pain scores will be&#xD;
      collected at rest and movement, total opioid consumption, as well as the devise tolerability.&#xD;
      Additionally as per other pain pilot IRB approved projects, we shall also collect common&#xD;
      medical information including time to bowel movement, PONV, time to oral intake (liquid and&#xD;
      regular diet), time to hospital discharge, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, readmission&#xD;
      to the hospital, readmission due to pain related issues, quality of recovery after joint&#xD;
      replacement, overall patient satisfaction, and patient satisfaction related to pain&#xD;
      management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the patient is discharged from the hospital, they will be asked to complete a patient&#xD;
      satisfaction survey. If the patient should be discharged prior to 120 hours post-operatively,&#xD;
      they will be asked to wear the device home. They will also be ask to remove the device at 120&#xD;
      hours (five days) after device placement and dispose of it in their home. We will provide&#xD;
      removal instructions. Data post- hospital discharge regarding pain scores, opioid&#xD;
      consumption, and device tolerability will be collected after discharge by calling the patient&#xD;
      every day for 120 hr. following the placement of the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At UPMC Shadyside, we expect the patients undergoing primary unilateral either total hip or&#xD;
      total knee surgery to be discharged on the day of surgery, or the next day but no later than&#xD;
      48 hrs following surgery. Therefore, for the patients in whom a Bridge device will be placed&#xD;
      following surgery, it will be possible to document, if during the 120 hrs following the&#xD;
      placement of the device, the patient returned to the hospital because of pain. This will be&#xD;
      documented in the patient chart and therefore will be available for review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given that most post-bariatric patients are discharged at 72 hours or before, pain scores,&#xD;
      opioid needs, and device tolerability at 96 and 120 hours will be collected from the patient&#xD;
      by calling them after discharge. Participants will be called once daily up until day 5 and&#xD;
      asked to report information. Phone calls to patients after discharge are consistent with&#xD;
      routine clinical care. If the kidney transplant patient is discharged prior to 120 hours (5&#xD;
      days), they will also be called daily to record pain scores, opioid needs, and device&#xD;
      tolerability for the time they are discharged up to 5 days post-device placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As stated in the protocol, each patient will be discharged according to the standard protocol&#xD;
      defined by the surgical team. Data collected for both historical and study subjects will be&#xD;
      the base of the standard clinical data collected for any patient undergoing surgery at UPMC&#xD;
      SDY, UPMC Montefiore and UPMC MWH. After the patient is discharged from the hospital data&#xD;
      related to pain, nausea and vomiting and opioid consumption will be obtained by a daily phone&#xD;
      call.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The historical controls will include a medical chart review of patients from the Acute&#xD;
      Perioperative Pain Service at UPMC Shadyside Hospital. Data collection includes total&#xD;
      narcotic/non-opioid analgesic requirement, pain scores and nausea and vomiting after the&#xD;
      surgery. Other information collected from the medical record will include age, race and&#xD;
      medical history. Additionally, we will also collect common medical information including time&#xD;
      to bowel movement, time to oral intake (liquid and regular diet), time to hospital discharge,&#xD;
      intensive care unit (ICU) admission, readmission to the hospital, readmission due to pain&#xD;
      related issues. No Personal Health Identifiers will be collected from the historical&#xD;
      controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects in whom the Bridge device will be placed will receive the same standard ERAS&#xD;
      protocol as the patients who will be used as historical control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No power analysis will be performed. However, the tolerability of the placement of the bridge&#xD;
      device (focus of this study) will be assessed using the pain scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will record pain scores before and after the placement of the Device (prior to leaving the&#xD;
      recovering room, and at 24, 48, 72, 96 and 120 or until discharge from the hospital) and&#xD;
      compare it to the historical data of pain scores recorded prior to discharge from the&#xD;
      hospital.&#xD;
