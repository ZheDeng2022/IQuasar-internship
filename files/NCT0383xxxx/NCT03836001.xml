  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine if Serlopitant (when taken by mouth) is safe and works on itch in patients aged&#xD;
      13 and above with EB.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigator will determine whether more patients taking serlopitant 5 mg daily as&#xD;
      compared to placebo can achieve a 3 point or greater reduction in itch severity as measured&#xD;
      by numeric rating scale (NRS) score following two months of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives include;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. comparative weekly change in daily worst-itch NRS,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. comparative weekly change in average daily NRS itch severity,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. the proportion of patients who achieve at a least 30% or 50% reduction in NRS severity&#xD;
           from baseline at the end of two months of treatment,&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. proportion of patients achieving 2 point and 4 point reductions in average daily itch&#xD;
           severity following two months of treatment,&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. change in participant-reported outcomes of global assessment of change in itch and&#xD;
           overall improvement as measured by static participant assessment of itch, participant&#xD;
           global assessment of change in itch severity, and caregiver global assessment of change&#xD;
           in itch severity, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. assessment on the safety of Serlopitant in adolescents (â‰¥13 y.o.) and adults with&#xD;
           pruritus associated with epidermolysis bullosa (EB).&#xD;

    <description>Serlopitant is a small molecule, highly selective NK1-R (neurokinin-1 receptor) antagonist. Two critical mediators of the urge to scratch are Substance P, or SP, and its receptor, NK1-R. SP is a naturally occurring peptide in the tachykinin neuropeptide family. Tachykinins have a broad range of functions in the nervous and immune systems. SP binding of NK1-R has been shown to be a key mediator of sensory nerve signaling, including the itch-scratch reflex and the vomiting reflex.</description>

             score of at least 5 on average itch score in the past 24 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Female subjects must be of non-childbearing potential (ie, post-menopausal for at&#xD;

             limit of normal.&#xD;

             function may be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;

             preparations or bath oil treatment specifically for relief of pruritus within 30 days&#xD;
