    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open label, single center, dose escalation study to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability and pharmacokinetic profile of dMAb-ZK190 following delivery of INO-A002 with&#xD;
      Hylenex® recombinant delivered IM followed by EP in healthy adult Dengue naïve volunteers&#xD;
      ages 18-60 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will apply a 3+3 design such that 3 additional subjects will be enrolled into the&#xD;
      cohort if one DLT (Section 7.3.1) is observed in one out of the first 3 subjects dosed during&#xD;
      the 28-day period of safety and PK assessment. If no additional DLT is observed in 3&#xD;
      additional subjects (i.e., 1 DLT in 6 total subjects), dosing will proceed to the subsequent&#xD;
      cohort. However, if any additional DLT occurs (i.e., &gt;1 DLT in 6 total subjects), then that&#xD;
      dose will be deemed not tolerated and the prior dose will be considered the maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose (MTD).&#xD;
