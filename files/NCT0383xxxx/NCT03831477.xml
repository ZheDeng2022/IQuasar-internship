      Prospective, single centre, evaluator-blind study of the safety and performance of fractional&#xD;
      radiofrequency (RF) for the treatment and reduction of facial wrinkles.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate 15 subjects requesting treatment of their facial wrinkles. The study&#xD;
      will involve three treatments on both sides of the face with 3-5 week intervals between each&#xD;
      treatment. Subjects will be followed at 6 and 12 weeks after their last treatment. Analysis&#xD;
      will be performed on all subjects who receive at least one treatment. An additional&#xD;
      histological analysis will be conducted including up to 12 of the participating subjects.&#xD;
