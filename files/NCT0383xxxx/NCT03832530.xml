    <textblock>
      In this mixed-methods research study, the study team will offer comprehensive safer&#xD;
      conception services to 150 HIV-uninfected women reporting an HIV-infected or high-risk&#xD;
      partner and personal or partner plans for pregnancy in rural Uganda to evaluate prevalence&#xD;
      and determinants of uptake and adherence (tenofovir plasma concentration &gt;40ng/mL, opening&#xD;
      pill device to take &gt;80% of dispensed pills) to PrEP and other safer conceptions strategies&#xD;
      among Ugandan women exposed to HIV.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study plans to enroll 150 HIV-uninfected women with an HIV-positive or HIV-serostatus&#xD;
      unknown partner and personal or partner pregnancy plans. Eligible women will participate in&#xD;
      comprehensive safer conception counseling including offering daily, oral TDF/FTC as PrEP. The&#xD;
      primary outcomes are to evaluate uptake of and adherence to periconception PrEP among&#xD;
      HIV-exposed women in rural Uganda.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To accomplish this, women will participate in quarterly study visits, HIV and pregnancy&#xD;
      testing, questionnaires and safer conception/adherence group counseling sessions.&#xD;
      Participants will be eligible to initiate PrEP at any time during the first 6 months of the&#xD;
      9-month study follow-up period. Participants who initiate PrEP will use an electronic pill&#xD;
      cap to measure daily adherence and will be asked to give blood samples to measure plasma TFV&#xD;
      at quarterly study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For women who become pregnant in the first 9 months, investigators will follow them up&#xD;
      through completion of pregnancy to evaluate PrEP use, pregnancy and infant outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration will be a maximum 19 month follow-up period (through pregnancy outcome) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will offer objective sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing to all&#xD;
      participants in order to measure the prevalence, incidence, and factors associated with STIs.&#xD;
      Investigators will compare incidence among women who choose and who do not choose PrEP.&#xD;
      Investigators will also measure the number of episodes of condomless sex each month as a&#xD;
      mediator variable for STI development.&#xD;
