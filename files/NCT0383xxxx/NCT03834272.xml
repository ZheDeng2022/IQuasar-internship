      This single-site, feasibility study to assess the initial safety and efficacy of the LUM&#xD;
      Imaging System for in vivo imaging of metastases to the peritoneum from primary&#xD;
      gastrointestinal cancer, ovarian cancer and mesothelioma. This feasibility study consists of&#xD;
      two parts: (a) a dose escalation phase to select the optimal dose followed by (b) enrollment&#xD;
      of additional patients to develop the tumor detection algorithm.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to see if LUM015 can be safely given to human patients before&#xD;
      surgery at a dose that allows the removed tumor tissue to be identified when imaged by the&#xD;
      LUM imaging device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first 6 subjects will receive an intravenous injection of LUM015 intraoperatively with a&#xD;
      dose of either 1.0 mg/kg or 1.5 mg/kg. The first three subjects will receive a dose of 1.0&#xD;
      mg/kg and if there are no adverse events the next three subject will receive the increased&#xD;
      dose of 1.5 mg/kg. LUM015 will be given through a vein in the arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the final dose of LUM015 has been determined, 12 additional subjects will be given that&#xD;
      final dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sequence of events during the surgical procedure will vary based on the standard of care&#xD;
      used by the surgeon. Study treatment ends when the surgery is completed. All patients will&#xD;
      continue their enrollment in the study until their first follow-up visit and they will&#xD;
      continue to be followed until the medical team determines no further surgical intervention is&#xD;
      required. Patients with adverse events that are determined to be possibly related to the LUM&#xD;
      Imaging System will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event.&#xD;
