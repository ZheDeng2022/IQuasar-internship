  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal is to study participants with recurrent C. difficile infection (CDI) treated&#xD;
      with lyophilized fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). The safety, clinical response and&#xD;
      relapse rate in patients will be assessed.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Recurrence of CDI following a course of standard antibiotic therapy is high, especially in&#xD;
      the elderly patients over 65 years of age, in hospitalized and in the immunocompromised&#xD;
      patients. As CDI is characterized by intestinal dysbiosis. Fecal Microbiology Transplantation&#xD;
      (FMT) has been investigated as alternative treatment for CDI and has been determined to be&#xD;
      effective and safe. One of the major challenges of offering FMT is the availability of&#xD;
      suitable donors. A donor may no longer be able to continue to donate for a number of reasons&#xD;
      and this may lead to temporary interruption of FMT in centers which offer the program. In&#xD;
      order to continue to offer FMT whenever needed, we will investigate the efficacy of&#xD;
      lyophilized FMT. The lyophilization (freeze-drying) process works by dehydrating a frozen&#xD;
      donor stool sample to complete dryness, using controlled temperature and pressure gradients.&#xD;
      This lyophilized process results in a powdered form of the sample. Studies have shown that&#xD;
      lyophilized donor stool samples have similar microbial compositions as the same fresh&#xD;
      sample.The technique of freeze drying has been used for decades for the industrial storage of&#xD;
      microbes and has been used. Preliminary study of lyophilized stool for FMT has been performed&#xD;
      in dogs. Preliminary efficacy data in dogs with inflammatory bowel disease suggest equal&#xD;
      efficacy as compared to fresh stool, although controlled study has yet to be performed.&#xD;
      Should the lyophilized FMT (L-FMT) demonstrate to be equally or more effective than frozen&#xD;
      FMT, there would be significant advantages. As with frozen FMT, lyophilized FMT will allow&#xD;
      patients to receive FMT immediately as it can take up to two weeks for a donor's screening&#xD;
      laboratory testing results to be available. Lyophilized FMT will also be more cost effective&#xD;
      as less number of donors will need to be screened given the prolonged shelf life of&#xD;
      lyophilized FMT which can be kept at above the freezing temperature. 9 This will also allow&#xD;
      wider distribution and accessibility especially to the regions with limited capacity to&#xD;
      manufacture FMT.&#xD;
