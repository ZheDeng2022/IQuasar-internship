  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have developed a new technology, termed in-vivo laser capture&#xD;
      microdissection (IVLCM), that addresses the limitations of endoscopic biopsy for screening&#xD;
      for BE and provides targeted genomic profiling of aberrant tissue for more precise prediction&#xD;
      of EAC risk. The device is a tethered capsule endomicroscope (TCE) that implements optical&#xD;
      coherence tomography (OCT) to grab 10-mm-resolution, cross-sectional microscopic images of&#xD;
      the entire esophagus after the capsule is swallowed. This OCT-based TCE technology is used in&#xD;
      unsedated patients to visualize images of BE and dysplastic BE. During the IVLCM procedure,&#xD;
      TCE images of abnormal BE tissue are identified in real time and selectively adhered onto the&#xD;
      device. When the capsule is removed from the patient, these tissues, targeted based on their&#xD;
      abnormal OCT morphology, are sent for genomic analysis. By enabling the precise isolation of&#xD;
      aberrant esophageal tissues using a swallowable capsule, this technology has the potential to&#xD;
      solve the major problems that currently prohibit adequate BE screening and prevention of&#xD;
      Esophageal Adenocarcinoma EAC.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In Vivo Laser Capture Microdissection (IVLCM). The IVLCM tethered capsule is identical to&#xD;
      those used in current approved OCT TCE studies.The capsule is swallowed by the patient and&#xD;
      then, in real time, a region for tissue capture, is identified on the images. When a targeted&#xD;
      site is identified, a capture laser (1450 nm, 0.8 W, 1 second exposure; within the range of&#xD;
      the previously approved OCT-TCE tissue marking study) irradiates this area in the patient,&#xD;
      heating the water in the tissue and transforming it to steam. The accumulated water steam&#xD;
      overcomes the tissue matrix's adhesion force, ejecting a small amount of tissue and&#xD;
      integrating it with the capsule's external shell. This process may then be repeated to&#xD;
      collect multiple samples. After the device is pulled out from the patient, the captured&#xD;
      tissues can be extracted for genomic analysis. Ex vivo animal tissue studies have shown that&#xD;
      capture laser does not damage DNA/RNA; high quality whole genome information can be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this IVLCM study, the investigators are using a 1450 nm laser to capture tissue that was&#xD;
      previously approved to make cautery &quot;marks&quot; in the esophagus. The IVLCM capture laser's&#xD;
      specifications are the same as those of the marking laser and the power will be within the&#xD;
      IRB approved power range (0.82 W 1s). Prior to testing laser marking in humans, the&#xD;
      investigators first demonstrated the safety of laser marking in animals in vivo. Histological&#xD;
      assessment showed that the cautery marks did not penetrate through the submucosa and the vast&#xD;
      majority of the effects were limited to the epithelium, lamina propria, and muscularis mucosa&#xD;
      layers. The extent of thermal damage was comparable to conventional biopsies in standard of&#xD;
      care endoscopic biopsy procedures. After this animal study, the investigators conducted a&#xD;
      pilot study in humans in which over 30 marks were made in 22 enrolled subjects without any&#xD;
      adverse events or safety concerns. In addition to these balloon studies, the investigators&#xD;
      are currently conducting a TCE marking study. So far, the investigators have imaged and&#xD;
      marked 13 subjects through a capsule without any adverse effects or safety concerns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty (N=30) subjects will be enrolled in this study.&#xD;
