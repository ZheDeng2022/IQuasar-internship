    <textblock>
      The long-term goal of this project is to improve HIV and substance use outcomes and reduce&#xD;
      recidivism for HIV+ substance users released from jail. The overall objective of the proposed&#xD;
      R34 project is to develop and pilot test a multi-sector community-clinic collaborative&#xD;
      intervention that can subsequently be implemented on a larger scale (as part of a future R01)&#xD;
      to achieve this goal. Our central hypothesis is that HIV+ substance users released from jail&#xD;
      can successfully overcome obstacles to re-entry and continuity of HIV care with&#xD;
      individualized, culturally competent assistance in navigating both social and medical&#xD;
      services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Develop and refine a collaborative CHW and re-entry program intervention that targets&#xD;
      HIV outcomes, substance use and recidivism in HIV+ jail releasees.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial comparing the collaborative intervention&#xD;
      (n=40) compared to treatment as usual (n=40) in HIV+ substance users released from jail.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aim 1 Introduction: This first aim will be critical to successful implementation of the&#xD;
      CHW-DOORS intervention. Employing a formerly incarcerated CHW to assist individuals leaving&#xD;
      prison in order to connect to healthcare has been successfully implemented in different&#xD;
      settings, but it has not been applied specifically to HIV patients or those leaving jail (v.&#xD;
      prison), nor has it been integrated into a community based organization. The objective of&#xD;
      this aim is to adapt the evidence-based CHW intervention to the HIV population and to the&#xD;
      jail setting and to integrate the CHW into existing processes at DOORS and the outpatient HIV&#xD;
      clinic system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design. Aim 1.1: The first step of Aim 1 will be to train the CHW using the&#xD;
      transitions clinic approach, add modules on HIV and substance use and familiarize the CHW&#xD;
      with DOORS processes and HIV clinic workflow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1.2: The second step will be to complete qualitative interviews with stakeholders in&#xD;
      three different settings- the jail, the HIV clinic and DOORS. All interviews will be&#xD;
      semi-structured, one-on-one interviews, with an estimated 4-7 interviews in each setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The structured component of the interview guide will prompt interviewee input on study design&#xD;
      (e.g. recruitment, intervention, follow-up visits), content of the intervention (e.g. high&#xD;
      demand services) and an open-ended component eliciting possible barriers to study&#xD;
      implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1.3: The final step in Aim 1 will be to complete pilot testing with 5 subjects, which&#xD;
      will focus on refining recruitment/enrollment protocols, streamlining study assessments and&#xD;
      evaluating the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment: In order to protect patient confidentiality, potential subjects will be referred&#xD;
      by medical staff who provide clinical care to HIV+ inmates. When an inmate enters the Dallas&#xD;
      County Jail, he/she is evaluated by a medical provider within 24 hours (medical assessment&#xD;
      program, MAP). At this visit, the inmate can disclose any medical conditions that they have&#xD;
      including HIV, in which case he/she will be referred to the jail HIV clinic (scheduled within&#xD;
      1-7 days of jail entry). In addition, HIV testing is offered in an opt-out manner when&#xD;
      inmates have blood drawn for any reason (approximately 10% of jail population) and by inmate&#xD;
      request, and those with positive test results are referred to jail HIV clinic. Candidates&#xD;
      coming through the MAP or HIV clinics who agree to be approached will be contacted by a&#xD;
      research assistant (RA). The RA will explain the study to interested individuals, will obtain&#xD;
      additional contact information (additional phone numbers, address or location in community&#xD;
      where patient could be found) and permission to contact the individual after release. Clinic&#xD;
      staff will also routinely request this information from interested individuals in case they&#xD;
      are released prior to RA visit in jail. Once released, the research team will contact the&#xD;
      individual releasee to schedule an enrollment visit. At this visit, which will occur as soon&#xD;
      as possible after jail release (maximum within 30 days of release), the research team will&#xD;
      obtain informed consent and enroll the participant into the study. The enrollment may occur&#xD;
      at the UT Southwestern HIV research unit (located above the main HIV clinic) or in the&#xD;
      community as per participant preference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment: In order to be enrolled, individuals must (a) be â‰¥18 years old, (b) have a&#xD;
      confirmed diagnosis of HIV, (c) have evidence of uncontrolled HIV (viral load &gt;200 copies/mL&#xD;
      within 90 days of enrollment, self-reported non-adherence to HIV medications or no community&#xD;
      clinic visit in the 6 months preceding incarceration), (d) report or have medical records&#xD;
      documenting any opioid (illicit or prescription misuse), stimulant (cocaine, ecstasy, or&#xD;
      amphetamines), or heavy alcohol use (as determined by the 3-item Alcohol Use Disorders&#xD;
      Identification Test (AUDIT-C) within the past 12 months, and (e) provide at least 2 forms of&#xD;
      contact information. They will also be asked to provide a release of information for their&#xD;
      medical records at the jail and community clinics/ hospitals. No randomization will occur in&#xD;
      Aim 1 as all 5 participants in the pilot testing phase will be assigned to the intervention.&#xD;
      Baseline assessments will occur after informed consent is obtained and enrollment is&#xD;
      complete. These assessments will focus on variables in the conceptual model, with collection&#xD;
      of demographics (age, race/ethnicity, gender, HIV risk factor) and social variables (marital&#xD;
      status, housing, education, employment/income, insurance, benefits, social support). Subjects&#xD;
      will also be asked about HIV care (engagement in care, antiretroviral therapy, adherence to&#xD;
      medications (using visual analog scale), barriers to care), mental illness, and substance use&#xD;
      (using ASSIST questionnaire).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: The first meeting with the CHW will occur at the time of enrollment if&#xD;
      possible, depending on availability of the participant and CHW, otherwise it may occur&#xD;
      anytime within 14 days of enrollment. After release from jail, the CHW will help the&#xD;
      participant navigate to DOORS, where they will meet with a &quot;broker&quot;, someone who helps the&#xD;
      client/participant arrange and negotiate referrals to services within the extensive&#xD;
      partner/provider network. The first broker meeting will typically occur within 2-4 weeks&#xD;
      after release, as this is a critical window for re-engagement in care, underscored by the&#xD;
      fact that this is also a high-risk period for increased unprotected sex and return to&#xD;
      substance use. Per DOORS' standard practice, the broker will complete a comprehensive needs&#xD;
      assessment with the participant. Based on these assessments, together with the participant,&#xD;
      the broker will develop a personalized re-entry plan with a detailed list of referrals and&#xD;
      calendar of scheduled visits with relevant agencies within the DOORS network.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up visits and assessments: Research visits will be scheduled at 3 months, 6 months and&#xD;
      12 months. A 4-week window before and 8-week window after the target follow-up dates will be&#xD;
      permitted for study assessments. Assessments will be completed at each follow-up visit,&#xD;
      including substance use, adherence, healthcare utilization and recidivism, with blood draw&#xD;
      for HIV viral load collected at the 6-month visit. In order to maximize efficient utilization&#xD;
      of resources, for baseline and other follow-up visits, HIV viral load will be abstracted from&#xD;
      medical records. In order to have sufficient time to enroll and complete 12 month study&#xD;
      visits for the 80 participants in Aim 2, the 5 pilot participants from Aim 1.3 need to reach&#xD;
      at least the 3 month time point but not 6 or 12-month visits before beginning study&#xD;
      enrollment for Aim 2. Pilot participants will complete through 12-month visits as this will&#xD;
      provide insight as to how best to conduct these later follow-up visits. All participants will&#xD;
      receive financial reimbursement for study visits ($25 for each visit), unless they are&#xD;
      incarcerated at the time of the visit. Jail inmates are not permitted to receive any&#xD;
      financial incentives during incarceration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 2: Conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial comparing the collaborative intervention&#xD;
      (n=40) compared to treatment as usual (n=40) in HIV+ substance users released from jail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introduction. In this aim, we will test the CHW-DOORS intervention that was refined in Aim 1&#xD;
      in a randomized fashion. The goal of this aim is to establish feasibility of a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial in this setting, to determine preliminary efficacy of the intervention and&#xD;
      to inform sample size calculations for a fully powered trial. In addition, this aim will&#xD;
      provide data regarding key factors involved in HIV+ substance users accessing substance use&#xD;
      treatment and HIV care after jail release. Our working hypothesis is that from the&#xD;
      stakeholder input and pilot testing completed in Aim 1, we will be able to successfully&#xD;
      conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial and gain valuable insight into key predisposing&#xD;
      and enabling factors influencing healthcare needs and utilization in this population, and how&#xD;
      these may impact HIV viral load, substance use and recidivism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design. Potential participants will be referred to the research study by Dallas&#xD;
      County jail medical providers as described in Aim 1.3. Candidates who agree to be approached&#xD;
      will be contacted by a RA who will recruit, and review eligibility criteria (see Aim 1.3).&#xD;
      After release, potential participants will be contacted in order to complete informed&#xD;
      consent, study enrollment and randomization (to be completed within 30 days of release from&#xD;
      jail). All participants will provide 2 specific forms of locator information (telephone&#xD;
      number for themselves, friend/family member, address, email, specific location where they may&#xD;
      be located to aid in retention efforts). Participants will complete baseline assessments and&#xD;
      will then be randomized to the intervention CHW-DOORS versus treatment as usual (TAU).&#xD;
      Randomization will occur by random assignment using a computer program, without block&#xD;
      randomization given the small sample size. TAU participants will receive standard of care,&#xD;
      which involves passive referral by jail medical staff to the outpatient HIV clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention. Participants randomized to the intervention arm will meet with the CHW and a&#xD;
      staff member from DOORS as outlined in Aim 1.3. Any modifications to this protocol after&#xD;
      pilot testing in Aim 1.3 will be implemented in Aim 2. The general premise will be the same,&#xD;
      where the DOORS broker will complete a needs assessment, generate an individualized re-entry&#xD;
      plan and make referrals to providers in the extensive DOORS network. The CHW will assist the&#xD;
      participant in navigating these referrals, specifically with regards to HIV care, substance&#xD;
      use treatment and mental healthcare. The measurement of the intervention will be as noted in&#xD;
      Aim 1.3, with the DOORS broker following routine agency processes for referrals and&#xD;
      measurement using the PIECES technology program and the CHW will record specifics (where,&#xD;
      when, duration) of each visit and what was addressed during these intervention visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Assessments. All participants will complete baseline assessments prior to randomization&#xD;
      and will have follow-up visits at 3, 6 and 12 months as noted in Aim 1.3. A blood draw will&#xD;
      be performed for 6-month HIV viral load. Follow-up visits will assess HIV viral load&#xD;
      (abstracted from medical record for all visits other than 6 month), substance use (using&#xD;
      ASSIST), healthcare utilization including attendance of HIV clinic visits, emergency room&#xD;
      visits, hospitalizations and reincarceration. If individuals are reincarcerated at the Dallas&#xD;
      County Jail at the time of the follow-up visits, an attempt will be made to complete study&#xD;
      visits at the jail.&#xD;
