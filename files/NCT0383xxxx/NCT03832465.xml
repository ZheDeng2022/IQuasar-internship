  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is an important causal factor of chronic gastritis, peptic&#xD;
      ulcer disease, gastric cancer and gastric lymphoma. The World Health Organization classified&#xD;
      H. pylori as a Group 1 carcinogen in 1994. Endoscopic examination is indicated to confirm the&#xD;
      above diagnosis for patient with H. pylori infection. The eradication of H. pylori can reduce&#xD;
      the recurrence rate of peptic ulcer disease and even has the potential to prevent gastric&#xD;
      cancer. H. pylori is the most common chronic bacterial infection in humans. The prevalence of&#xD;
      H. pylori is about 30-50% in the Western adult population. It is estimated that about 50% of&#xD;
      people are infected with this bacterium in Taiwan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Triple therapy which contains a proton pump inhibitor and two antibiotics among&#xD;
      clarithromycin, amoxicillin, and metronidazole is the most commonly used regimen for H.&#xD;
      pylori eradication. The treatment duration is 7 to 14 days. However, the eradication rate of&#xD;
      standard triple therapy has fallen below 80% in many countries due to the worldwide&#xD;
      increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistant strains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several strategies have been proposed to increase the eradication rate in the first line&#xD;
      therapy or as a rescue therapy, including extending the treatment duration to 14 days,&#xD;
      increasing the doses of antibiotics, the use of four or even five drugs regimen (sequential,&#xD;
      concomitant, quadruple or quintuple therapy), and other antibiotics such as levofloxacin.&#xD;
      However, these therapies may increase the side effects and costs of treatment, decrease the&#xD;
      compliance of patients and increase the rate of worldwide antibiotic resistance steadily. The&#xD;
      WHO has listed H. Pylori as one of 16 antibiotic-resistant bacteria that have the greatest&#xD;
      threat to human health in February, 2017.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most commonly used oral antibiotics for the treatment of H. pylori are&#xD;
      Amoxicillin、Clarithromycin、Metronidazole、Levofloxacin and Tetracycline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, with the increasing rates of antibiotic-resistance for Clarithromycin and&#xD;
      Metronidazole, the Clarithromycin and Metronidazole were replaced by Levofloxacin as a first&#xD;
      line or second line treatment in some area. However, the eradication rate of&#xD;
      Levofloxacin-containing triple therapy is suboptimal in many countries. The investigators aim&#xD;
      to compare the efficacy of different formulation between Levofloxacin Powder and Levofloxacin&#xD;
      Solution in the Intraluminal levofloxacin therapy, and to improve the eradication efficacy of&#xD;
      one-week Levofloxacin-containing triple therapy via the Intraluminal therapy.&#xD;

      During the endoscopic examination, patient is sedated with intravenous Dormicum 5mg&#xD;
      (5mg/1ml/amp), the vital signs will be closely monitored by physiological monitor (PHILIPS&#xD;
      SureSigns VM6). The treatment will be terminated immediately if unstable vital sign detected&#xD;
      or if patient asks for termination. Patients will receive tests to evaluate H. pylori&#xD;
      colonization in the gastric cardia (UFT300) and duodenal bulb (CLO). With endoscope&#xD;
      apparatus, the gastric mucus is irrigated with acetylcysteine solution and the pH value of&#xD;
      gastric juice will be measured with the pH test strips before irrigation and after&#xD;
      irrigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators randomly assigned medicaments containing different formulation (powder or&#xD;
      solution ) of levofloxacin to dispense on the surface of gastric mucosa and duodenal mucosa&#xD;
      of duodenal bulb. After the intraluminal therapy, patients will rest for 30 to 60 minutes and&#xD;
      go home if the effect of sedation subsided. Patients can take meal if no abdominal&#xD;
      discomfort. C13-Urea breath test (UBT) will be used to assess the existence of H. pylori 6&#xD;
      weeks after the intraluminal therapy. Patients failed to achieve intraluminal eradication of&#xD;
      H. pylori will be randomly assigned to 7-day or 14-day levofloxacin-containing triple therapy&#xD;
      (levofloxacin 500 mg once daily, amoxicillin 1 g twice daily, and esomeprazole 40 mg twice&#xD;
      daily). The C13-UBT will be used to assess the existence of H. pylori 6 weeks after the oral&#xD;
      antibiotic therapy. The overall eradication rates of the intraluminal therapy plus the oral&#xD;
      antibiotics therapies will be evaluated.&#xD;
