  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multi-modality therapy that includes a brachytherapy implant improves outcomes in locally&#xD;
      advanced prostate cancer when compared to other radiation-based treatments, but is also&#xD;
      associated with more adverse side effects. The goal of the OPTiMAL trial is to reduce these&#xD;
      side effects by using advanced imaging and biopsy techniques to locate cancer and deliver&#xD;
      precision radiation therapy, while not compromising the unprecedented high cure rates&#xD;
      obtained for the brachytherapy arm of the Androgen Suppression Combined with Elective Nodal&#xD;
      and Dose Escalated Radiation Therapy (ASCENDE-RT) randomized control trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, some applied research in genetics, pathology and medical imaging is included.&#xD;
      Novel medical imaging methods, namely, multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),&#xD;
      multi-parametric trans-rectal ultrasound (TRUS), prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)&#xD;
      positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) are used for re-staging of prostate&#xD;
      cancer. This is followed by trans-perineal biopsy to locate cancerous areas of the prostate&#xD;
      with greater precision compared to conventional biopsy. Results from imaging are compared to&#xD;
      those from biopsy to develop image-based cancer detection methods.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of OPTiMAL is to combine new imaging and treatment methods to reduce the&#xD;
      incidence and severity of the genito-urinary (GU) side effects associated with&#xD;
      radiation-based, multimodality treatment for men with locally advanced prostate cancer (PCa).&#xD;
      OPTiMAL was inspired by the highly successful Androgen Suppression Combined with Elective&#xD;
      Nodal and Dose Escalated Radiation Therapy (ASCENDE-RT) randomized control trial, in which&#xD;
      men who were randomized to a low-dose-rate brachytherapy (LDR-PB) boost experienced&#xD;
      unprecedented high cure rates, but also had more side effects and a slightly greater decrease&#xD;
      in quality-of-life (QoL) scores when compared to the standard arm which used a dose-escalated&#xD;
      external beam (DE-EBRT) boost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      By allowing a higher radiation dose to the cancer while delivering lower dose to healthy&#xD;
      tissue, more accurate cancer localization will result in a decrease in adverse effects and&#xD;
      better QoL, when compared to the men in the experimental arm of ASCENDE-RT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 1 in 4 newly diagnosed PCa patients will be found to have unfavorable disease , either&#xD;
      National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) high-risk or intermediate-risk with multiple&#xD;
      adverse features; such men carry a 40% to 80% chance of biochemical recurrence within 5 years&#xD;
      of radical prostatectomy (RP) or conventional external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) alone.&#xD;
      With some exceptions, such men generally require multi-modality treatment to provide the best&#xD;
      chance of long-term disease-free survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the ASCENDE-RT randomized control trial, led by investigators at BCCANCER, an LDR-PB boost&#xD;
      established unprecedented new standards for biochemical (PSA) progression free survival&#xD;
      (b-PFS); however, a higher incidence of adverse GU side effects was also observed. Despite&#xD;
      the increase in adverse effects, most men were symptom-free at 5 years and more than 80% had&#xD;
      minimal or no adverse effects left over from treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      OPTiMAL is powered to determine if combining improved techniques for delivering combined&#xD;
      pelvic EBRT and LDR-PB boost will lead to a reduction in grade 2 and above,&#xD;
      physician-reported GU adverse effects when compared to the ASCENDE-RT trial while not&#xD;
      compromising the high rates of biochemical progression free survival survival (b-PFS)&#xD;
      observed in ASCENDE-RT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Trans-perineal, template-guided mapping biopsy (TTMB) is the gold standard for locating&#xD;
           the extent of intra-prostatic disease, but it is an invasive procedure. Therefore,&#xD;
           another objective of this trial is to establish and investigate correlations between&#xD;
           TTMB and multi-modality, multi-parametric imaging provided by trans-rectal ultrasound&#xD;
           (TRUS), MRI and PET/CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To further develop the use of dual air kerma strength sources in a single LDR-PB&#xD;
           implant, which the investigators have shown can improve the planning target volume (PTV)&#xD;
           dose coverage while reducing dose to sensitive normal tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Finally, the TTMB biopsy material will also be used to compare computer-based digital&#xD;
           pathology to conventional pathology as read by human pathologists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will undergo a series of re-staging investigations, which includes multiple&#xD;
      advanced imaging: PSMA PET/CT, Multi-parametric MRI and TRUS and trans-perineal biopsy.&#xD;
      Re-staging will be used to determine which components of multi-modality therapy are&#xD;
      appropriate for each individual patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment includes a combination of 125 iodine LDR-PB, followed by EBRT. Based on the results&#xD;
      from the re-staging phase and baseline patient diagnosis, in some cases androgen deprivation&#xD;
      therapy will be prescribed for a total duration of at least one year with at least 6 months&#xD;
      being neoadjuvant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      125 Iodine LDR-PB implant will be designed to deliver a minimum peripheral dose (MPD) of 100&#xD;
      Gy to the entire gland and a boost of 150-200 Gy either to the entire peripheral zone, or in&#xD;
      cases with well-localized intra-prostatic disease on the basis of TTMB, to regions of known&#xD;
      disease only. For all trial subjects the use of dual strength source may be used if their use&#xD;
      results in superior coverage and/or protection of normal tissues&#xD;
&#xD;
      Shortly after the completion of the LDR-PB implant, all patients will receive supplemental&#xD;
      pelvic EBRT using Volumetric Modulated Radiation Therapy (VMAT) intensity modulated radiation&#xD;
      therapy (IMRT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include a total of 105 enrolled patients who will receive multi-parametric&#xD;
      imaging and TTMB over 4 years. Based on the investigators' experience at the BCCANCER, it is&#xD;
      estimated that 75 patients will receive focal LDR-PB boost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assuming that the 2-year cumulative incidence rate of grade 2 or above toxicity is similar to&#xD;
      the DE-EBRT arm of the ASCENDE-RT trial (10%), a study exposing 75 subjects to focal LDR-PB&#xD;
      boost is sufficient to demonstrate a cumulative incidence significantly lower than the 26% in&#xD;
      the LDR-PB boost arm of ASCENDE-RT with 96% power based on a two-sided 95% confidence&#xD;
      interval of the Kalbfleisch-Prentice incidence estimator. Enrolling 75 subjects over 4 years&#xD;
      with 2 years of follow-up and assuming the 2-year rate of grade 3 or above toxicity is 3.4%,&#xD;
      the 95% confidence interval for 2-year incidence will exclude 7.7% with more than 81% power.&#xD;
