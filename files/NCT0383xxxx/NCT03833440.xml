  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research Hypothesis Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in France&#xD;
      and in western countries, accounting for more than 1.8 million new cases and 1.5 million&#xD;
      deaths worldwide in 2012. Recent advances in the management of patients with Non-small Cell&#xD;
      Lung Cancer Patients (NSCLC) include the use of therapies targeting oncogenes but a molecular&#xD;
      alteration is currently found in only the half of the non-squamous NSCLC . More recently,&#xD;
      immune check point inhibitors (ICI), firstly targeting PD-(L)1, became available and&#xD;
      demonstrate an overall survival advantage over standard second-line chemotherapy both in&#xD;
      squamous and non-squamous NSCLC. Unfortunately, this global overall survival benefit is&#xD;
      driven by approximately 20% of the patient's population while a large majority of patients is&#xD;
      in fact progressing in the first weeks of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the context of personalized medicine, innovative immunotherapy strategies in oncology are&#xD;
      based on the principle of immune-contexture and require:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The identification of biomarkers for assessing the specific immune-contexture of each&#xD;
           patient (microenvironment, tumors and effector cells)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The development of new treatments targeting their appropriate effector cells in&#xD;
           monotherapy or combination treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current PIONEER-Clinical study is aimed at assessing how to overcome resistance to ICIs&#xD;
      monotherapies or ICI in combination with platinum-based chemotherapies, with experimental&#xD;
      precision immunotherapies combined to Durvalumab in 2nd, 3rd or 4th line, in advanced NSCLC&#xD;
      progressors patients after up to 18more than 6 w. of anti PD (L) 1. for ICIs monotherapies&#xD;
      and after more than 12w. of anti PD(L)1 in combination with chemotherapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some supplementary blood and tissue samples are aimed at identification of personalized&#xD;
      patients' biomarkers, correlation of them with the efficacy endpoints, in order to better&#xD;
      understand mechanisms of resistance and improve their future treatment.&#xD;

      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During a mandatory post treatment 28-day wash-out period, 135 advanced NSCLC patients with&#xD;
      progressive disease evaluated between 6 and 18w. of a second or third line ICI monotherapy;&#xD;
      will undergo a screening visit. After signing an informed written consent, if they are found&#xD;
      eligible, their participation in the study will ensue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment allocation will be performed using the randomization module of the eCRF, :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm A: combination of Durvalumab (MEDI4736) + Monalizumab (IPH2201), to target a PD-L1&#xD;
           co-inhibitory pathway&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm B: combination of Durvalumab + oleclumab (MEDI9447), to target limitations of&#xD;
           antitumor T-cell immunity caused by adenosine receptor signaling&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm C: combination of Durvalumab + AZD6738, to potentially enhance anti- tumour T-cell&#xD;
           responses&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm D: a standard third or forth-line chemotherapy maintenance (Docetaxel).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A maximum of 120 patients will be randomized, with 30 patients per arm (4 arms).&#xD;

        Note: Patients, if enrolled, should not receive live vaccine whilst receiving IP and up to&#xD;
        30 days after the last dose of IP.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding or male or female patients of&#xD;
             reproductive potential who are not willing to employ effective birth control from&#xD;
             screening to 180 days after the last dose of durvalumab in combination with an other&#xD;
             agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known allergy or hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs or any of the study drug&#xD;
             excipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Judgment by the investigator that the patient is unsuitable to participate in the&#xD;
             study and the patient is unlikely to comply with study procedures, restrictions and&#xD;
             requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A diagnosis of ataxia telangiectasia&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving, or having received, concomitant medications, herbal supplements&#xD;
             and/or foods that significantly modulate cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) or&#xD;
             P-glycoprotein (P-gp) activity (washout periods of 5 half-lives( minimum2 weeks), but&#xD;
             3 weeks for St. John's Wort). NOTE these include common azole antifungals, macrolide&#xD;
             antibiotics and other medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has had prescription or non-prescription drugs or other products known to be&#xD;
             CYP3A4 and/or CYP2B6 substrates or CYP3A4 and/or CYP2B6 substrates with a narrow&#xD;
             therapeutic index. Exposure of other drugs metabolised by CYP3A4 and/or CYP2B6 may be&#xD;
             reduced and additional monitoring may be required, see Appendix E.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The use of herbal supplements or 'folk remedies' (and medications and foods that&#xD;
             significantly modulate CYP3A activity) should be discouraged. If deemed necessary,&#xD;
             such products may be administered with caution and the reason for use documented in&#xD;
             the CRF. Please see Appendix E, for further details.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with relative hypotension (&lt;90/60 mmHg) or clinically relevant orthostatic&#xD;
             hypotension, including a fall in blood pressure of &gt;20 mmHg at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any of the following cardiac criteria currently or within the last 6 months (by New&#xD;
             York Heart Association (NYHA) ≥ Class 2 where applicable)&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Patients at risk of brain perfusion problems, e.g., medical history of carotid&#xD;
                  stenosis or pre-syncopal or syncopal episodes, history of TIAs&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Uncontrolled hypertension (grade 2 or above) requiring clinical intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Mean resting corrected QT interval (QTc) &gt;470 msec for females and &gt;450 for&#xD;
                  men,obtained from 3 electrocardiograms (ECGs) 5-10 minutes apart using the&#xD;
                  Fredericia formula&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Conduction abnormality not controlled with pacemaker or medication e.g. complete&#xD;
                  left bundle branch block, third degree heart block&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Any factors that increase the risk of QTc prolongation or risk of arrhythmic&#xD;
                  events such as hypokalaemia, congenital long QT syndrome, immediate family&#xD;
                  history of long QT syndrome or unexplained sudden death under 40 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. Unstable angina pectoris or acute myocardial infarction&#xD;
&#xD;
