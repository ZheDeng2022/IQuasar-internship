  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the activity and safety profile of mirvetuximab&#xD;
      soravtansine (IMGN853) in patients with type II endometrial cancers that overexpress folate&#xD;
      receptor alpha (FRα).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will enroll patients with persistent or recurrent FRα-positive uterine serous&#xD;
      carcinoma (pure or mixed), Grade 3 endometrial adenocarcinoma, or carcinosarcoma with high&#xD;
      grade serous or Grade 3 endometrioid components. All patients must have measurable disease.&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to assess the activity of IMGN853 as measured by&#xD;
      objective response rate (ORR). The secondary objectives are to assess the duration of overall&#xD;
      survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and durable disease control rate (DDCR), as&#xD;
      well as the safety profile of IMGN853 in endometrial carcinoma patients.&#xD;
      Exploratory/correlative objectives are to correlate ORR, PFS, and OS with the level of folate&#xD;
      receptor α expression and explore use of circulating tumor (ct) DNA as a biomarker for&#xD;
      disease response and compare its performance to cancer antigen 125 (CA-125). All enrolled&#xD;
      patients will receive IMGN853 at a dose of 6 mg/kg administered intravenously once every 3&#xD;
      weeks until unacceptable toxicity or progression of disease requiring discontinuation of&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
