  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the proposed trial, patients will be administered ribociclib+everolimus prior to surgical&#xD;
      resection of their tumor. Recurrent GBM patients will be randomized into one of the three&#xD;
      time-interval cohorts for the first two dose levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the lead-in dose escalation study, the first six subjects (lead-in) will receive&#xD;
      ribociclib 400 mg and everolimus 2.5 mg orally-administered in 5 daily doses with the last&#xD;
      dose. If one or less patient experiences DLT among the 6 patients, this regimen with&#xD;
      ribociclib 400 mg and everolimus 2.5mg will be considered safe and we will continue with the&#xD;
      dose escalation phase of the study up to Level 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four dose escalation levels:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Level 0: ribociclib 400mg and everolimus 2.5&#xD;
&#xD;
      Level 1: ribociclib 600mg and everolimus 2.5mg&#xD;
&#xD;
      Level 2: ribociclib 600mg and everolimus 5mg&#xD;
&#xD;
      Level 3: ribociclib 600mg and everolimus 10mg&#xD;

             becoming pregnant, unwilling to use highly effective methods of contraception during&#xD;
             dosing and for 3 months after the last dose of study treatment. Highly effective&#xD;
             contraception methods include:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of&#xD;

                  contraception&#xD;
&#xD;

                  hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment.&#xD;
                  In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening) with the appropriate&#xD;
                  post-vasectomy documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate. For female&#xD;
                  subjects on the study the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner&#xD;
                  for that subject&#xD;
&#xD;

                  of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS), or other forms of&#xD;
                  hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate &lt;1%), for&#xD;
                  example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  In case of use of oral contraception, women should have been stable on the same&#xD;
                  pill for a minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note: Oral contraceptives are allowed but should be used in conjunction with a&#xD;
                  barrier method of contraception due to unknown effect of drug-drug interaction&#xD;
                  Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they&#xD;
                  have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate&#xD;
                  clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had&#xD;
                  surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation&#xD;
                  at least six weeks ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the&#xD;
                  reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level&#xD;
                  assessment is she considered not of child bearing potential&#xD;
&#xD;
         30. Sexually active males unwilling to use a condom during intercourse while taking drug&#xD;
             and for 21 days after stopping treatment and should not father a child in this period.&#xD;

             of the drug via seminal fluid.&#xD;
