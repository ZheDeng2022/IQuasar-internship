      This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of ceftolozane/tazobactam (MK-7625A) plus&#xD;
      metronidazole versus meropenem in adults diagnosed with complicated intra-abdominal infection&#xD;
      (cIAI). The primary hypothesis is ceftolozane/tazobactam plus metronidazole is non-inferior&#xD;
      to meropenem, as measured by the clinical response rate at the Test-of Cure (TOC) visit in&#xD;
      the Clinically Evaluable (CE) population.&#xD;

Clinical cure (favorable) was defined as complete resolution or significant improvement in signs and symptoms of the index infection, such that no additional antibacterial therapy or surgical or drainage procedure is required for the index infection. Clinical failure (unfavorable) was defined as death related to IAI at any time point; persisting or recurrent infection within the abdomen requiring additional intervention to cure; need for treatment with additional antibiotics for ongoing IAI symptoms; or post-surgical wound infection that requires additional antimicrobial therapy and/or non-routing wound care.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Favorable Per-Participant Microbiological Response of Eradication or Presumed Eradication at TOC Visit: Expanded Microbiologically Evaluable (EME) Population</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately Day 30</time_frame>
    <description>An overall microbiological response was determined by the Sponsor for each participant based on individual microbiological responses for each baseline bacterial pathogen. A favorable individual microbiological response was eradication (absence of the baseline bacterial pathogen in a specimen appropriately obtained from the original site of infection) or presumed eradication (absence of material to culture in a participant who is assessed as a clinical cure). In order for the participant to have a favorable overall microbiological response, each individual baseline bacterial pathogen must have had a favorable microbiological outcome. The percentage of participants with a favorable per-participant microbiological response of eradication or presumed eradication was reported for the TOC visit.</description>

    <description>A microbiological response was determined for each bacterial pathogen isolated at baseline by the Sponsor. Favorable microbiological responses included eradication (absence of the baseline bacterial pathogen in a specimen appropriately obtained from the original site of infection) or presumed eradication (absence of material to culture in a participant who is assessed as a clinical cure).

        <description>Clinical response was classified as &quot;cure&quot;, &quot;failure&quot;, or &quot;indeterminate&quot;. Clinical cure (favorable) was defined as complete resolution or significant improvement in signs and symptoms of the index infection, such that no additional antibacterial therapy or surgical or drainage procedure is required for the index infection. Clinical failure (unfavorable) was defined as death related to IAI at any time point; persisting or recurrent infection within the abdomen requiring additional intervention to cure; need for treatment with additional antibiotics for ongoing IAI symptoms; or post-surgical wound infection that requires additional antimicrobial therapy and/or non-routing wound care. Indeterminate (unfavorable) was defined as participants for whom study data are not available for evaluation of efficacy for any reason. The percentage of participants with clinical response of clinical cure, clinical failure, or indeterminate at EOT was summarized.</description>

        <description>An overall microbiological response was determined by the Sponsor for each participant based on individual microbiological responses for each baseline bacterial pathogen. A favorable individual microbiological response was eradication (absence of the baseline bacterial pathogen in a specimen appropriately obtained from the original site of infection) or presumed eradication (absence of material to culture in a participant who is assessed as a clinical cure). In order for the participant to have a favorable overall microbiological response, each individual baseline bacterial pathogen must have had a favorable microbiological outcome. The percentage of participants with a favorable per-participant microbiological response of eradication or presumed eradication was reported for the TOC visit.</description>

        <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product that did not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.
