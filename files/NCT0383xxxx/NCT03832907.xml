      This is an exploratory prospective study primary aiming to evaluate differences between&#xD;
      Point-of-care (POC) testing (standard of care) and Dexcom G6 CGM (Continues Glucose&#xD;
      Monitoring sensor system) in 1) glycemic control measured by mean daily blood glucose and 2)&#xD;
      identifying hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events - in patients with type 1 and type 2&#xD;

      Several studies have shown that the use of a device that can measure blood glucose levels&#xD;
      every 5 minutes is more effective in identifying low blood glucose (hypoglycemia) and high&#xD;
      blood glucose (hyperglycemia) when compared to regular measurements with fingersticks [point&#xD;
      of care (POC)].&#xD;

    <description>The Dexcom G6 CGM is a commercially available factory-calibrated sensor system. The system measures interstitial glucose every 5-15 minutes, providing real-time and more complete glycemic profile during 24-hours compared to standard POC glucose testing, and replaces the need for finger sticking. Potential limitations include the need for removing the sensor before MRI or diathermy treatment, and the potential interference in patients with severe dehydration.&#xD;
In parallel, same participants will be monitored by the standard of care point-of-care (POC) capillary glucose tests. Diabetes guidelines recommend bedside capillary POC testing before meals and at bedtime to assess glycemic control and to adjust insulin therapy in the hospital.</description>

    <description>A blinded factory-calibrated continues glucose monitoring sensor system Dexcom G6 will be placed shortly after admission. Two CGM devices will be inserted in all patients - one in the abdomen and one in the arm to also assess differences in blood glucose readings between upper extremity and abdominal insertion sites. Information on CGM readings will be collected daily during the hospital stay and after hospital discharge for 10 days using the Dexcom Studio software to download the Dexcom receiver data.</description>

        <description>Percentage of CGM glucose values within defined performance zones (A-E) indicating potential for clinical error. The Clarke error grid analysis uses a Cartesian diagram, in which the estimated/predicted values are displayed on the y-axis, whereas the reference values are presented on the x-axis. This diagram is subdivided into 5 zones: A, B, C, D, and E. The points that fall within zones A and B represent, respectively, sufficiently accurate and acceptable glucose results (better outcome), points in zone C may prompt unnecessary corrections, points in zones D and E represent erroneous and incorrect treatment.</description>
