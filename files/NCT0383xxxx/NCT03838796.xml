  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative recurrence and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC）is the main problem&#xD;
      during the treatment. Although with the development of medical science, some drugs have been&#xD;
      found for the prevention and treatment of postoperative recurrence of HCC (such as&#xD;
      postoperative application of interferon to prevent early tumor recurrence), but there is&#xD;
      still no drug widely recognized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) is a palliative treatment for hepatocellular&#xD;
      carcinoma. TACE can detect the early recurrence of tumor after liver resection, and has a&#xD;
      complementary treatment effect on hidden residual lesions. For patients with high-risk, the&#xD;
      tumor recurrence rate can be significantly reduced, and the tumor-free survival can be&#xD;
      prolonged by TACE. Therefore, patients with high-risk of recurrence after resection were&#xD;
      routinely arranged TACE treatment as an adjuvant treatment after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lenvatinib is a multi-target receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), which mainly inhibits&#xD;
      vascular endothelial growth factor(VEGF) receptor-1, 2, 3; fibroblast growth factors(FGF)&#xD;
      receptor-1, 2, 3, 4; platelet derived growth factor receptor(PDGFR)α; RET and KIT, thereby&#xD;
      inhibiting tumor cell proliferation, inducing apoptosis, and acting as an anti-angiogenesis.&#xD;
      The REFLECT study showed that the median overall survival(OS) of the patients in the&#xD;
      lenvatinib group was 13.6 months (95% CI, 12.1-14.9) and that in the sorafenib group was 12.3&#xD;
      months (95% CI, 10.4-13.9) , which reached a non-inferiority end point (HR = 0.92; 95% CI,&#xD;
      0.79-1.06). In addition, all secondary endpoints in the lenvatinib group were significantly&#xD;
      better than the sorafenib group. A subgroup analysis based on Chinese patients showed that&#xD;
      the OS of Lenvatinib was significantly 4.8 months longer than sorafenib group (15.0 months vs&#xD;
      10.2 months). Other three secondary endpoints, progression-free survival(PFS) (9.2 months vs&#xD;
      3.6) and time to progression(TTP)(11.0 months vs 3.7 months) and objective response rate(ORR)&#xD;
      (21.5% vs 8.3%), were also significantly better in Lenvatinib group. Based on the above&#xD;
      datas, lenvatinib will become a new choice for Chinese patients with HCC. It has also been&#xD;
      approved by the FDA and CFDA as the first-line treatment for patients with advanced HCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So, this study is to observe the effect of lenvatinib combined with TACE in preventing the&#xD;
      recurrence in high-risk patients with HCC.&#xD;

    <description>The patient underwent transfemoral hepatic artery angiography one month after surgery to observe whether there was tumor staining in the liver. If there was suspicious tumor staining, micro-catheter was superselected to the tumor blood vessel, the embolization agents and chemotherapy drugs were injected. If there was no tumor staining, a small amount of embolization agents were slowly injected into the artery.</description>
