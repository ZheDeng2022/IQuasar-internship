  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      in patients with vertical or horizontal defective of there ridge it is difficult to have&#xD;
      prosthetic restoration with natural appearance emetating and simulating the adjacent abutment&#xD;
      emergence profile so this study aims to develop the defective area using two different&#xD;
      materials of soft tissue grafting techniques to restore the missing tissue and regain soft&#xD;
      tissue volume and profile&#xD;

      PICO P: single pontic site with deficient ridge. I: Soft tissue augmentation with partially&#xD;
      de-epithelized connective tissue graft.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C: Soft tissue augmentation with Mucograft. O: Soft tissue biotype, Soft tissue volume, pain&#xD;
      score and patient satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All subjects will pass through phase I therapy (Supragingival scalling, subgingival&#xD;
           debridement and oral hygiene instructions) before any surgical procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After 4 weeks, all subjects will be examined to determine patient compliance with oral&#xD;
           hygiene procedures (tooth brushing twice daily and chlorhexidine HCL 1.25% mouthwash&#xD;
           twice daily).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eligible patients will be randomized before being enrolled in the study. (T-1 +4 weeks)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study casts for case study will be fabricated and clinical photographs will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of edentulous defect site and neighboring teeth will be performed by scanning&#xD;
           the study casts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical phase (T0):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same operator (N M) will perform all procedures under local anesthesia (4% articaine with&#xD;
      1/200 000 adrenaline Solution), using a local infiltration technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recipient site will be prepared using 15c-blad creating a full-thickness coronal&#xD;
      dissection and a partial thickness apical dissection creating a vestibular pouch.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The grafting procedure then performed and graft will be fixed by suturing at the periphery of&#xD;
      the flap using 5/0 suture material and the rest will be inserted in the vestibular pouch.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will have printed post-surgical instruction and precautions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intervention for control group :&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. The recipient site will be prepared with a full-thickness coronal dissection and a&#xD;
                partial thickness apical dissection to creat a vestibular pouch.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. The acellular matrix (Mucograft®) will be sutured using 5/0 suture material around&#xD;
                the defect margin and secured in the vestibular pouch.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intervention for test group :&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. The recipient site will be prepared with a full-thickness coronal dissection and a&#xD;
                partial thickness apical dissection vestibular pouch.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. The graft which is composed of two parts:The coronal part, which is epithelialized&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  The apical part, which is formed of connective tissue only.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. On the defect area, the crestal surface is de-epithelialized with a beveled&#xD;
                incision and the apical surface is prepared with a partial-thickness dissection&#xD;
                with two vertical- releasing incisions extended apically, without involving the&#xD;
                adjacent papillae, in order to create a pouch area.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. The onlay section (epithelialized area) of the graft will be sutured on the crestal&#xD;
                surface of the defect, while the inlay section (connective tissue) will be inserted&#xD;
                and secured in the vestibular pouch area.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post-operative care:&#xD;
&#xD;
      As with any regenerative site, caution must be exercised in post-operative care and during&#xD;
      oral hygiene practices at or near the surgical site. After 12 hours 875 mg of Amoxicillin and&#xD;
      125 mg of Clavulanic acid tablet (1 g Amoxicillin Clavulanate) twice daily for 7 days,&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory tablet (Amphiltirne ) if the patient need ,maximum three times/day and&#xD;
      chlorhexidine HCL 1.25% mouth wash mouthwash twice daily are prescribed. Sutures will be&#xD;
      removed after 14 days. (12)&#xD;
&#xD;
      * Follow-up (T1, T2,T3):&#xD;
&#xD;
      (T1):2 weeks post-operatively sutures removal . (T2) 3 months post-operatively appointments&#xD;
      will be assigned for the prosthetic preparation and temporization for 2 weeks (T3): 6 months&#xD;
      post-operatively appointments will be assigned for the prosthetic delivery and fill in the&#xD;
      Questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Criteria for discontinuing intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Infection and sloughing of the graft.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  if the patient wouldn't commit to the follow-ups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Strategies to improve adherence to intervention protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient preparation in terms of improving oral hygiene and first phase therapy procedures&#xD;
      will be performed for patient to doctor trust. Complete information concerning the protocol&#xD;
      will be provided and simplified to the patient with reasoning of all the steps included as&#xD;
      the importance of the follow up visits and home medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevant concomitant care and interventions that are permitted or prohibited during the&#xD;
      trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperatively the patients will be using analgesics, oral antibiotic therapy, and&#xD;
      chlorhexidine HCL 1.25% mouthwash mouthwash for at two week.&#xD;

    <description>graft procedures to obtain simultaneous tissue augmentation in the horizontal and vertical dimensions. The donor site was prepared with a full-thickness coronal dissection and a partial-thickness apical dissection.The objectives were to use a single procedure to achieve simultaneously apico-coronal and buccolingual augmentation,to have a smaller open wound in the donor site and less patient discomfort, and to guarantee better revascularization of the onlay section aided by the submerged connective tissue section of the graft.</description>

    <description>For preprosthetic defects, a standard mucosal augmentation procedure, which is well reported in the literature, was performed. The surgical site produced by the surgery leaves a &quot;denuded area&quot; supraperiosteally that is addressed by &quot;grafting&quot; with a xenogeneic collagen membrane (Mucograft).&#xD;
purpose of the surgery is to improve the quantity of attached mucosa to facilitate the final dental reconstruction</description>
