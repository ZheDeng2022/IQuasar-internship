    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to design a library of biomechanical musculoskeletal models of&#xD;
      patients before and after surgery. These models will be evaluated to analyze the support they&#xD;
      can provide for virtual surgical planning in orthopedics.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While there are multiple surgical options for the treatment of a specific orthopaedic&#xD;
      pathology, the patient is most often operated on according to the preferred method used&#xD;
      within a team and not necessarily according to the method that would optimize the functional&#xD;
      result. In addition, the variability of morphologies means that some patients, due to their&#xD;
      anatomical characteristics, cannot benefit from an intervention that is necessary&#xD;
      (incorrectly sized implant, unsuitable equipment). As the orthopaedic surgical procedure is&#xD;
      definitive, the investigators believe that it may be useful to perform surgical simulations&#xD;
      on a digital clone before performing on the real patient. This would be relevant for the&#xD;
      patient, the caregiver, but also the community, as many surgical reopenings or treatment&#xD;
      failures can be attributed to the difficulty of properly planning surgery for a functional&#xD;
      objective in the long term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Retrospective study based on patient's record and medical imaging files.&#xD;
&#xD;
      50 patients For 3D medical imaging, the data will be obtained from the examinations performed&#xD;
      by the patient before and after his surgery, they will be anonymized. The investigators will&#xD;
      use the so-called &quot;DICOM&quot; sequences allowing the reconstruction of 3D models The personal&#xD;
      data collected will be taken from the Surgical Report and the pre-surgical check-up (age,&#xD;
      sex, height, weight) The patient identifier will be assigned for each subject with the centre&#xD;
      number, initials (Surname / First name of the patient) and its inclusion number per centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Personal data will be obtained from the department's computerized or paper patient file&#xD;
      Medical imaging data will be anonymized by the medical imaging department staff who will be&#xD;
      assigned the patient identifier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The database will be centralized and hosted on a laboratory computer on an encrypted and&#xD;
      password-protected session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The usable patient records will be recruited according to the database of surgical procedures&#xD;
      performed in the various departments. If the file meets the inclusion and non-inclusion&#xD;
      criteria, patients will then be contacted (telephone) to discuss their participation in the&#xD;
      study, and verbally obtain their non-opposition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be informed in a complete and fair manner, in understandable terms, of the&#xD;
      objectives of the study, their right to refuse to participate in the study or the possibility&#xD;
      of withdrawing at any time. All this information will be included on an information form&#xD;
      given to the patient by email or post.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the authorization has been obtained, the data will be anonymized and downloaded to an&#xD;
      encrypted hard disk for processing for model reconstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical data will be retrieved from the operative report and the pre-surgical file and then&#xD;
      integrated into the database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The models resulting from this procedure will bear the name of the surgical procedure&#xD;
      associated with a patient identification number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Morphological comparison of individual bone structures and the outer envelope including&#xD;
      internal soft tissues (measurement of distances and volumes) Comparison of radiological&#xD;
      parameters used in routine pre-surgery routine (measurement of angles, segment lengths,&#xD;
      tissue thickness) Between February 2019 and June 2021, the three surgical teams will search&#xD;
      for patients who have benefited from the surgeries and who meet the inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The distribution will be as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Grenoble University Hospital (12 cases):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  5 patients Knee&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  5 patients Rachis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2 patients Hip&#xD;
&#xD;
      Raymond Poincaré University Hospital (19 cases):&#xD;
&#xD;
      2 patients for tendon transfer procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 patient for muscle stretching&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2 patients for lower limb amputations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  5 patients Rachis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  6 patients Foot / Ankle&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 patient Shoulder&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2 patients Elbow / Hand&#xD;
&#xD;
      Groupe Hospitalier Croix saint Simon (19 cases):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3 patients Knee&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2 Patients Hip&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  9 patients Foot / Ankle&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2 patients Shoulder&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3 patients Elbow / Hand&#xD;
&#xD;
      From April 2019, the models will begin to be developed by the TIMC IMAG laboratory team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the biomechanical models are developed, the investigators will virtually apply the&#xD;
      surgery performed on the pre-surgical models. Then the investigators will compare the virtual&#xD;
      post surgery models with the post surgical models. A description of the limitations of the&#xD;
      virtual procedures will be established in order to analyze the scientific locks to be removed&#xD;
      and move towards biomechanical simulation-based surgical planning.&#xD;
