             been performed 4 months or more prior to the first dose of study drug. A male who has&#xD;
             been vasectomized less than 4 months prior to the first dose must follow the same&#xD;
             restrictions as a non-vasectomized male).&#xD;

                  and throughout the study. Appropriate sources (e.g., Flockhart Table) will be&#xD;
                  consulted to confirm lack of PK/PD interaction with study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has been on a diet incompatible with the on-study diet, in the opinion of the PI or&#xD;
             designee, within the 28 days prior to the first dose and throughout the study.&#xD;

          -  Donation of blood or significant blood loss within 56 days prior to the first dose.&#xD;
&#xD;

             product within 30 days, or 5 half-lives of the investigational product (whichever is&#xD;
             longer) of the first dose of study drug in the current study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any condition or circumstance, in the opinion of the PI or designee, which may make&#xD;
