  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sedation is used for 30 to 70 % of all intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Deep sedation can&#xD;
      be used for lot of disease like acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deep sedation was defined by RASS (Richmond Assessment Sedation Scale) below -3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deep sedation can be associated with increased mortality, length stay, duration of mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation, acute brain dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The french exploration neurologic group in ICU developed a score used Brainstem response&#xD;
      patterns in patient deeply sedated by midazolam and showed that a high BRASS score is&#xD;
      associated with high mortality at day 28.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators think that BRASS score isn't associated with the medication used for&#xD;
      sedation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the investigators included all patients sedated independently of medication&#xD;
      used for sedation, we also excluded patient with neurologic disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to shown that high BRASS score at admission of patient without&#xD;
      neurologic disorder sedated is predictive of 28-day mortality.&#xD;

&#xD;
      The main objective is to shown that high BRASS score at admission of patient without&#xD;
      neurologic disorder sedated is predictive of 28-day mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BRASS score will be done in the 6 hours within admission. The Richmond Assessment&#xD;
      Sedation Scale (RASS) and Full Outline of unresponsiveness (FOUR) will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient characteristic's will be recorded (sex, age, Simplified Acute Physiology Score II&#xD;
      (SAPS II), medical or surgical admission, diagnosis at ICU admission (ARDS, sepsis,â€¦), the&#xD;
      reason of initiation of mechanical ventilation, the reason of sedation (agitation, analgesia,&#xD;
      asynchrony with ventilator).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The medication for sedation and the level at time of examination, the time between admission&#xD;
      and examination will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the outcome, the duration of mechanical ventilation, the duration of sedation&#xD;
      administration, the occurrence of delirium evaluated by Confusion Assessment Method-&#xD;
      intensive care unit (CAM-ICU), the length stay in ICU, death at day 28 and 90 will be&#xD;
      reported.&#xD;
