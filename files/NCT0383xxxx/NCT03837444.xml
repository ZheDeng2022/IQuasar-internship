  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic liver diseases related to viral hepatitis, metabolic syndrome or excessive alcohol&#xD;
      consumption can evolve towards cirrhosis. Cirrhosis is responsible for 170 000 deaths per&#xD;
      year in Europe. Initially asymptomatic and called &quot;compensated&quot; it can become &quot;decompensated&quot;&#xD;
      with the developement of acute complications such as infections, ascites or variceal&#xD;
      bleeding. The transition from compensated to decompensated cirrhosis is associated with a&#xD;
      reduction in survival from 95 to 55% at 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The only curative treatment for cirrhosis is liver transplantation (LT). Liver transplants&#xD;
      are allocated according to the severity of the patients. Despite a modest prognostic value&#xD;
      (area under the ROC curve = 0.7 to predict the risk of death), graft allocation is based on&#xD;
      the MELD (Model for End-Stage Liver Disease) score including INR, bilirubin and serum&#xD;
      creatinine. In 2014, 11.5% of registered patients died on the liver transplant waiting list,&#xD;
      illustrating the need for biomarkers that predict death and improve MELD-based prediction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microvesicles are membrane vesicles released in extracellular space during cell activation or&#xD;
      apoptosis. Our team showed that circulating levels of hepatocyte microvesicles increase with&#xD;
      the severity of cirrhosis and predict survival at 6 months independently of MELD score in a&#xD;
      cohort of 242 patients with cirrhosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type 1 interferons (IFN-1) are mediators of inflammation, which is excessively activated in&#xD;
      cirrhosis. Our team has shown that a gene signature (IFN score) measured in the immune cells&#xD;
      of 101 patients with cirrhosis is able to predict 6 month-survival independently of the MELD&#xD;
      score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the investigators hypothesize that a composite score combining the level of circulating&#xD;
      hepatocyte microvesicles, the IFN score and the MELD score could improve the prediction of&#xD;
      survival in patients with severe cirrhosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to compare the prognostic performance for the cumulative incidence&#xD;
      of death at 6 months of a composite score including MELD, hepatocyte microvesicle level and&#xD;
      IFN score with that of the MELD score alone, in patients with Child B or C cirrhosis,&#xD;
      considering liver transplantation as a competitive risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address this question, peripheral blood from 335 patients with Child B or C cirrhosis will&#xD;
      be obtained and hepatocyte microvesicle levels and IFN score will be measured using&#xD;
      ELISA/filtration and Real Time-quantitative PCR.&#xD;

      Natural history of cirrhosis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cirrhosis is the end stage form of chronic liver disease. It is estimated that 200,000 to&#xD;
      500,000 people in France have cirrhosis. Cirrhosis is responsible for more than 170,000&#xD;
      deaths per year in Europe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main causes of cirrhosis include excessive alcohol consumption, the leading cause in&#xD;
      Europe, and chronic viral hepatitis B and C, which are the leading causes in Asia and Africa.&#xD;
      In addition, the current epidemic of obesity and type 2 diabetes worldwide has led to a sharp&#xD;
      increase in the incidence of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis associated with metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome, particularly in North America.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cirrhosis is defined histologically as a diffuse alteration in the architecture of the liver&#xD;
      by annular fibrosis associated with regeneration nodules. With the emergence of non-invasive&#xD;
      tests allowing fibrosis measurement, cirrhosis is now considered highly probable when the&#xD;
      liver elasticity measured by Fibroscan® is &gt; 15 kPa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with cirrhosis may be perfectly asymptomatic and have normal liver function. In this&#xD;
      case, the Child-Pugh score, which rates the severity of cirrhosis, is &quot;A&quot;. However, the&#xD;
      severity of cirrhosis may increase, resulting in the development of signs of liver failure,&#xD;
      such as jaundice, decreased coagulation factors and hypoalbuminemia, and/or ascites or&#xD;
      hepatic encephalopathy. Cirrhosis is then classified as Child-Pugh B or C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The progression of cirrhosis involves various processes: on the one hand, a slow and&#xD;
      continuous worsening associated with the persistence of hepatic aggression by one or more&#xD;
      causal agents (alcohol and/or metabolic syndrome and/or virus) and on the other hand, rapid&#xD;
      worsening occurring with acute complications of the disease such as variceal bleeding or&#xD;
      bacterial infections. Indeed, cirrhosis is associated with major alterations in innate&#xD;
      immunity that promote severe bacterial infections, which can lead to organ failure. Such a&#xD;
      complication represents a turning point in the natural history of cirrhosis since the&#xD;
      transition from compensated to decompensated cirrhosis is associated with a reduction in&#xD;
      1-year survival from 95 to 60%. When these complications are associated with organ failure,&#xD;
      short term mortality is dramatically increased with one-third of patients dying within one&#xD;
      month. The association of acute decompensation of cirrhosis with one or more organ failures&#xD;
      has recently been defined as a new syndrome named Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure (ACLF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The only curative treatment for cirrhosis is liver transplantation (LT). However, each year,&#xD;
      between 10 and 15% of patients on the French liver transplant waiting list cannot access&#xD;
      transplant and die prematurely from an acute complication of cirrhosis. In addition, many&#xD;
      patients die before they are even put on the transplant waiting list, as evidenced by the&#xD;
      results of a recent French multicenter study showing that the 6-month mortality rate for&#xD;
      patients with decompensated cirrhosis, Child C, remains equal to 25%[8].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Predicting of the outcome is therefore a major challenge in the management of cirrhotic&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prediction of the outcome of patients with cirrhosis: clinical scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, prediction of the outcome of cirrhotic patients is based on the MELD (Model for&#xD;
      End-Stage Liver Disease) score. MELD score includes three objective laboratory criteria (INR,&#xD;
      serum bilirubin and serum creatinine). It was established in 2000 in an American cohort to&#xD;
      predict the risk of death at 3 months after TIPS placement (Transjugular Intrahepatic&#xD;
      Portosystemic Shunt). Its use was very quickly extended to the prediction 3-month survival of&#xD;
      cirrhotic patients on the transplant waiting list. Since 2007, in France, graft allocation&#xD;
      has been based on the MELD score, with patients with the highest score being transplanted&#xD;
      first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since that time, the predictive value of MELD has been studied in large cohorts, showing that&#xD;
      MELD's performance in predicting death is modest, with areas under the ROC curves (AUROC)&#xD;
      ranging from 0.64 to 0.72[3, 7, 19, 20]. In 2014, 7 years after the introduction of the MELD&#xD;
      score, it was found that 11.5% of patients on the liver transplant waiting list still died&#xD;
      before they could be transplanted. These data illustrate the need to improve our ability to&#xD;
      predict death of patients with advanced cirrhosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this perspective, some authors have tried to improve the MELD score by adding one or more&#xD;
      variables, such as serum sodium (MELD-Na=MELD-Na-[0.025×MELD× (140 - Na)] + 140). The&#xD;
      contribution of these modified MELD scores was not considered sufficient to promote their use&#xD;
      in clinical practice, leaving the objective of improving MELD unmet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prediction of the outcome of patients with cirrhosis: novel biomarkers&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beside clinical scores, some biomarkers look promising. Indeed, as part of the close&#xD;
      collaboration between the clinical departments of Beaujon Hospital (Hepatology and&#xD;
      Anesthesia-Resuscitation) and the Inserm teams (Dr E Weiss, Dr R Moreau, Inserm U1149, Centre&#xD;
      de recherche sur l'inflammation, Paris) and Pr PE Rautou, Dr C Boulanger, Inserm U970 ;&#xD;
      Centre de recherche cardiovasculaire, Paris), two types of biomarkers have recently been&#xD;
      identified that predict the survival of patients with cirrhosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microvesicles are vesicles released into the extracellular medium during cell activation or&#xD;
      apoptosis, two phenomena strongly involved in cirrhosis. The Inserm U970 team (Pr PE Rautou,&#xD;
      Dr C Boulanger) showed in 2012 that the circulating concentrations of hepatocyte&#xD;
      microvesicles increase with the severity of cirrhosis. In addition, microvesicles in patients&#xD;
      with child B or C cirrhosis promote portal hypertension by inducing arterial hyporeactivity&#xD;
      to vasoconstrictive agents. Based on these results, a prospective study including 242&#xD;
      patients with cirrhosis showed that circulating concentrations of hepatocyte microvesicles&#xD;
      are able to predict the survival at 6 months of patients with cirrhosis independently of the&#xD;
      MELD score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The susceptibility of cirrhotic patients to severe infections is related to abnormalities in&#xD;
      their innate immune response and in particular to the occurrence of an excessive inflammatory&#xD;
      response, responsible for organ failure. Type 1 interferons (IFN 1) are inflammatory&#xD;
      mediators whose impact on the prognosis of sepsis could be harmful. To determine whether type&#xD;
      1 IFN pathway activity was involved in the innate immune response deregulation and in the&#xD;
      susceptibility to sepsis of patients with cirrhosis, the Inserm U1149 team measured, using&#xD;
      Real-Time quantitative PCR, a gene signature (IFN score) reflecting the activation of this&#xD;
      pathway in the immune cells of 99 patients with decompensated cirrhosis hospitalized at the&#xD;
      liver department at Beaujon Hospital. The investigators have thus shown that the IFN score is&#xD;
      able to predict the risk of death of cirrhotic patients independently of the MELD score with&#xD;
      AUROC equal to 0.79 (0.7 for MELD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It should be noted that these two biomarkers (hepatocyte microvesicles and IFN score) reflect&#xD;
      different and complementary pathophysiological processes: hepatocyte microvesicles reflect&#xD;
      persistent liver injury while IFN score reflects innate immune response. It should also be&#xD;
      noted that these biomarkers, protected by two international patents (EP121528133.5 and&#xD;
      EP2016/077129) can be measured on peripheral blood using simple and readily available&#xD;
      techniques (ELISA/filtration, qPCR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this project, the investigators hypothesize that prediction of death of patients with&#xD;
      advanced cirrhosis (Child-Pugh B or C) by a composite score combining circulating&#xD;
      concentrations of hepatocyte microvesicles, IFN score and MELD score will be better than that&#xD;
      assessed using the MELD score alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This composite score will help physicians to judge the emergency of liver transplantation and&#xD;
      thus to refine criteria for the allocation of liver transplants. This composite score may&#xD;
      also identify a patient population at particular risk of death that should be subjected to&#xD;
      increased surveillance while waiting for liver transplantation. Through these two approaches&#xD;
      (better prioritization of patients for liver transplantation and increased monitoring of&#xD;
      high-risk patients), this new composite score will reduce mortality in cirrhosis patients&#xD;
      waiting for liver transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, new therapeutic approaches to improve survival of patients with severe cirrhosis&#xD;
      awaiting liver transplantation (e. g. by reducing the occurrence of complications) are&#xD;
      regularly tested. The composite score the investigators propose could also be used as a&#xD;
      &quot;companion&quot; to monitor the effectiveness of these new treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with Child-Pugh B or C cirrhosis (proven by liver biopsy, by non invasive method of&#xD;
      fibrosis quantification or by a combination of clinical, biological and radiological signs,&#xD;
      see above) will be included during a two-year period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be included during follow-up outpatient visits in hepatology or during&#xD;
      scheduled hospitalization for example for digestive endoscopy to screen signs of portal&#xD;
      hypertension or for ascites removal. They will therefore be in a stable condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Presence of acute events or events that may modify the risk of death or liver&#xD;
      transplantation, and/or the inflammatory response or release of microvesicles will be among&#xD;
      non-inclusion criteria (see above).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biomarker measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
      After informed consent, fifteen to twenty milliliters of peripheral venous blood (3 EDTA&#xD;
      tubes and 3 citrate tubes) will be collected from patients participating in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      For hepatocyte microvesicles, citrated tubes will be centrifuged twice and then frozen at&#xD;
      -80°C until analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the IFN score, blood contained in the 3 EDTA tubes will be used to isolate Peripheral&#xD;
      Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs). PBMCs will be lysed to obtain RNA that will be stored at&#xD;
      -80°C until the IFN score is measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the 2-year inclusion period, measurements of hepatocyte microvesicles and IFN&#xD;
      score will be performed for all patients during a 1-year period. Plasma concentrations of&#xD;
      hepatocyte microvesicles will be determined on platelet-free plasma using ELISA/filtration.&#xD;
      To measure IFN score, RNA from previously isolated PBMCs will first be reverse transcribed.&#xD;
      Then, the expression of five mRNAs of interest will be measure to calculate the IFN score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is the area under the ROC curve of the composite score including MELD,&#xD;
      hepatocyte microvesicle concentration and IFN score for predicting the cumulative incidence&#xD;
      of death at 6 months (considering liver transplantation as a competitive risk) compared to&#xD;
      the area under the ROC curve of the MELD score alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of the primary endpoint will be performed according to the recommendations&#xD;
      specific for survival analysis in patients with cirrhosis, using a survival analysis that&#xD;
      considers liver transplantation as a competitive risk. Data from patients who did not die or&#xD;
      have not been transplanted will be censored at the end of follow-up or on the date of last&#xD;
      news (if the patient is lost to follow-up) or at the date of termination of participation (in&#xD;
      the event of termination of participation). Follow-up period will be one year after inclusion&#xD;
      (maximum 13 months for patients who have been transplanted in the 12th month after&#xD;
      inclusion). A follow-up visit 6 and 12 months after inclusion will be scheduled. Data on&#xD;
      possible deaths or transplants will be obtained during this visit, using medical records, or&#xD;
      following telephone calls to patients or their relatives. For subjects who are lost to&#xD;
      follow-up, requests will be made to the CépiDc to obtain their vital status. Data concerning&#xD;
      possible transplants will be obtained via a request for access to the &quot;Cristal&quot; database&#xD;
      (https://www.sipg.sante.fr) developed by the Agence de la biomédecine.&#xD;
