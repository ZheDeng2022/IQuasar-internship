  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label randomized 24 week crossover trial assessing the treatment burden of a&#xD;
      weekly growth hormone injection regimen (somatrogon) compared to a daily growth hormone&#xD;
      injection regimen (Genotropin). Approximately 90 children with growth hormone deficiency who&#xD;
      have been stable on treatment with daily Genotropin will be enrolled.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be randomized to one of two sequences, either 12 weeks of continued treatment&#xD;
      with daily Genotropin followed by 12 weeks of treatment with weekly somatrogon, or 12 weeks&#xD;
      of treatment with weekly somatrogon followed by 12 weeks of treatment with daily Genotropin.&#xD;
      Subjects will have study visits at Baseline, Weeks 6, 12, 18, and 24. Subjects will also be&#xD;
      followed up by phone 8 to 12 days after each treatment period begins (Week 1 and Week 13).&#xD;
      Subjects and caregivers (as a Dyad) will complete questionnaires assessing treatment burden&#xD;
      at baseline and at the end of each 12 week treatment period. All subjects/caregivers will&#xD;
      receive a follow up phone call at Week 28.&#xD;

    <measure>Total Score Related to Overall Life Interference Assessed at Baseline, Using Dyad Clinical Outcomes Assessment 1 (DCOA 1) Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were assessed for their treatment burden using DCOA 1 questionnaire completed by participant/caregiver dyads. The participant life interference questionnaire component of the DCOA 1 had 7 questions (life interference [5 questions]: a measure of life interference [daily activities/social activities/leisure/night away from home/travel]; life interference-changes to life routine [1 question]: a measure of how often changes are made to life routine; and life interference-bother of growth hormone [GH] injections [1 question]: a measure of how often the growth hormone injections cause bother) and all questions used a 5-point scale: 1= never, 2= rarely, 3= sometimes, 4= often, 5= always. The overall life interference total score was sum of all 7 questions, scores were transformed from raw scores and converted to a 0 to 100 scale; a lower score meant less life interference (better outcome).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline up to 35 days after last dose of study drug (up to 29 Weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. SAE was any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that: resulted in death, was life threatening (immediate risk of death), required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions), resulted in congenital anomaly/birth defect. Treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) were defined as events that occurred between first dose of study drug up to 35 days after last dose of study drug. Related TEAEs were those AEs who had relation to the study treatment and was judged by investigator.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <pre_assignment_details>107 participants were screened for study eligibility. 87 Participants, aged 3 to less than 18 years with growth hormone deficiency (GHD) on stable treatment with somatropin, were deemed eligible for enrollment and randomized to receive treatment.</pre_assignment_details>

        <group group_id="P1">
          <title>Daily Genotropin Then Weekly Somatrogon</title>
          <description>Participants were randomized to receive Genotropin, daily subcutaneously at the same dose which they were receiving at the time of enrollment, for 12 weeks in Period 1. Period 1 was followed by Period 2, where participants received Somatrogon, weekly subcutaneously at a dose of 0.66 milligram per kilogram per week (mg/kg/week) for 12 weeks. There was no treatment wash-out period since these participants had to take growth hormone continually. Participants were followed up maximum for 35 days (5 weeks) after last dose of study drug.</description>

        <title>Total Score Related to Overall Life Interference Assessed at Baseline, Using Dyad Clinical Outcomes Assessment 1 (DCOA 1) Questionnaire</title>
        <description>Participants were assessed for their treatment burden using DCOA 1 questionnaire completed by participant/caregiver dyads. The participant life interference questionnaire component of the DCOA 1 had 7 questions (life interference [5 questions]: a measure of life interference [daily activities/social activities/leisure/night away from home/travel]; life interference-changes to life routine [1 question]: a measure of how often changes are made to life routine; and life interference-bother of growth hormone [GH] injections [1 question]: a measure of how often the growth hormone injections cause bother) and all questions used a 5-point scale: 1= never, 2= rarely, 3= sometimes, 4= often, 5= always. The overall life interference total score was sum of all 7 questions, scores were transformed from raw scores and converted to a 0 to 100 scale; a lower score meant less life interference (better outcome).</description>

        <title>Total Score Related to Convenience of the Injection Schedule Assessed at Baseline, Week 12 and Week 24, Using DCOA 1 Questionnaire</title>
        <description>Participants were assessed for their treatment experience using DCOA 1 questionnaire completed by participant/caregiver dyads. Participants were asked a question from Section I of the IPAQ PRO tool related to ease of injection schedule and used a 7-point scale: 1=extremely convenient to 7=extremely inconvenient. The total score related to convenience of injection schedule ranged from 1 to 7; scores were transformed from raw scores and converted to a 0 to 100 scale; a lower score meant a better outcome.</description>

        <description>Participants were assessed for their treatment experience using DCOA 1 questionnaire completed by participants (8-17 years old). Participants were asked 4 questions from Section I of the IPAQ PRO tool related to participant's injection signs and symptoms and used a 11-point scale: 0=no pain to 10=worst possible pain; 0=no stinging to 10=worst possible stinging; 0=no bruising to 10=worst possible bruising; and 0=no bleeding to 10=worst possible bleeding, respectively. The total score was sum of all questions; scores were transformed from raw scores and converted to a 0 to 100 scale; a lower score for injection signs and symptoms meant a better outcome.</description>

        <title>Total Scores Related to Caregiver Life Interference, Including Family Life Interference Assessed at Baseline, Week 12 and Week 24, Using DCOA 1 Questionnaire</title>
        <description>Participants were assessed for their treatment experience using DCOA 1 questionnaire completed by caregiver. Participants were asked 13 questions from Section I of the IPAQ PRO tool related to caregiver life interference and used a 5-point scale: 1= never to 5= always. The total score ranged was sum of scores from all questions; scores were transformed from raw scores and converted to a 0 to 100 scale; a lower score for caregiver and family life interference meant less life interference (a better outcome).</description>

Participants were asked a question from Section I of the IPAQ PRO tool related to number of missed injections (daily or weekly administration) during past 4 weeks. The total scores ranged from 0 to 31 for daily administration (Genotropin) and from 0 to 5 for weekly administration (Somatrogon). All scores were transformed from raw scores and converted to a 0 to 100 scale; a lower score for missed injections meant a better outcome.</description>

        <population>The full analysis set included all participants who were randomly assigned to study intervention and who took at least 1 dose of study intervention. Here &quot;Overall number of participants analyzed&quot; signifies participants evaluable for this outcome measure.</population>

        <title>Number of Participants as Per Responses to Caregiver Life Interference Assessed at Week 24, Using DCOA 2 Questionnaire</title>
        <description>Caregivers of participants were asked a question &quot;Which injection schedule interfered less?&quot; from Section II of the IPAQ PRO tool related to caregiver life interference and were assessed for 5 activities: daily activities (Activity 1), social activities (Activity 2), recreation/leisure activities (Activity 3), spending night away from home (Activity 4) and travel (Activity 5). Preference was expressed by choosing from any 1 option for each activity from: 1) weekly injection schedule interfered less (Somatrogon); 2) daily injection schedule interfered less (Genotropin); 3) no difference. The caregivers responded for the participants, and in actual they respond to the number of participants only but per caregiver responses.</description>
        <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
        <population>The full analysis set included all participants who were randomly assigned to study intervention and who took at least 1 dose of study intervention. Here &quot;Overall number of participants analyzed&quot; signifies participants evaluable for this outcome measure.</population>

            <title>Daily Genotropin Then Weekly Somatrogon</title>
            <description>Participants were randomized to receive Genotropin, daily subcutaneously at the same dose which they were receiving at the time of enrollment, for 12 weeks in Period 1. Period 1 was followed by Period 2, where participants received Somatrogon, weekly subcutaneously at a dose of 0.66 milligram per kilogram per week (mg/kg/week) for 12 weeks. There was no treatment wash-out period since these participants had to take growth hormone continually. Participants were followed up maximum for 35 days (5 weeks) after last dose of study drug.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants as Per Responses to Family Life Interference Assessed at Week 24, Using DCOA 2 Questionnaire</title>
        <description>Participants were assessed for their treatment experience using DCOA 2 questionnaire completed by participant/caregiver dyads. Participants/ caregiver were asked a question &quot;Which injection schedule interfered less?&quot; from Section II of the IPAQ PRO tool related to family life interference and assessed for 5 activities: daily activities (Activity 1), social activities (Activity 2), recreation/leisure activities (Activity 3), spending night away from home (Activity 4) and travel (Activity 5). Preference was expressed by choosing from any 1 option for each activity from: 1) weekly injection schedule interfered less (Somatrogon); 2) daily injection schedule interfered less (Genotropin); 3) no difference.</description>

        <population>The full analysis set included all participants who were randomly assigned to study intervention and who took at least 1 dose of study intervention. Here &quot;Overall number of participants analyzed&quot; signifies participants evaluable for this outcome measure.</population>

            <description>Participants were randomized to receive Genotropin, daily subcutaneously at the same dose which they were receiving at the time of enrollment, for 12 weeks in Period 1. Period 1 was followed by Period 2, where participants received Somatrogon, weekly subcutaneously at a dose of 0.66 milligram per kilogram per week (mg/kg/week) for 12 weeks. There was no treatment wash-out period since these participants had to take growth hormone continually. Participants were followed up maximum for 35 days (5 weeks) after last dose of study drug.</description>

        <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. SAE was any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that: resulted in death, was life threatening (immediate risk of death), required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions), resulted in congenital anomaly/birth defect. Treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) were defined as events that occurred between first dose of study drug up to 35 days after last dose of study drug. Related TEAEs were those AEs who had relation to the study treatment and was judged by investigator.</description>
