      Catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation with electrical isolation of the pulmonary veins in&#xD;
      the left atrium carries risk of esophagus thermal lesion. EnsoETM is a device . This study&#xD;
      evaluates the benefit of using the EnsoETM, a device device for esophageal temperature&#xD;
      adjustments, during catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation. Half of participants will&#xD;
      undergo esophageal temperature adjustment during pulmonary vein catheter ablation, while the&#xD;
      other half will undergo catheter ablation with no esophageal temperature adjustment.&#xD;

      1. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK. APPROACH TO THE PROBLEM&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background and justification&#xD;
&#xD;
      Atrial fibrillation is the most common type of heart arrhythmia. Electrical isolation of the&#xD;
      pulmonary veins in the left atrium with ablation is standard therapy in the invasive&#xD;
      treatment of atrial fibrillation. One of the risks of this intervention is thermal lesion of&#xD;
      the esophagus, since it is in contact with the posterior wall of the left atrium. The energy&#xD;
      applied for electrical isolation via either radiofrequency or cryotherapy can cause thermal&#xD;
      lesions due to proximity with the esophagus and the vagus nerve/parasympathetic nervous&#xD;
      system of the upper digestive tract. The incidence is not well established and data in the&#xD;
      existing scarce publications show a very wide range, from 3 to 60%, according to the&#xD;
      definition and means of the study used. The most recent systematic studies show values around&#xD;
      40-50%. The lesions observed vary in degree, from erythema or minor erosion to ulcers of the&#xD;
      esophageal mucosa, including local hematomas, spasms, and esophageal/gastric motility&#xD;
      disorders and even atrial-esophageal fistula, the extreme consequence of thermal esophageal&#xD;
      lesion; the incidence of the latter is low (0.25%), but it has an elevated mortality. The&#xD;
      best examination to diagnose and evaluate these lesions in all phases is upper digestive&#xD;
      endoscopy or fibro esophagogastroscopy. Although it is routine in digestive services&#xD;
      throughout the world, enabling the direct visualization and characterization of lesions, this&#xD;
      technique is not performed systematically after ablation procedures, which explains the&#xD;
      contradictory data in the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Likewise, the possible long-term consequences of minor lesions are unknown, which, in a large&#xD;
      number of patients are totally asymptomatic. For this reason, it cannot be ignored that acute&#xD;
      tissue damage, however minimal, could lead to future changes in the form of late onset&#xD;
      chronic esophageal pathology. The incidence and magnitude of esophageal involvement has been&#xD;
      directly related to the ablation technique and protocol. Most available studies have been&#xD;
      carried out in centers with ablation protocols that are significantly more aggressive than&#xD;
      those used in our care facility. For this reason, the investigators do not have reliable data&#xD;
      regarding the size of the problem in our center, which could present some differential&#xD;
      characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, the prevention of these esophageal lesions has entailed: limits in the energy&#xD;
      applied on the posterior wall of the left atrium (less power or shorter application time);&#xD;
      monitoring of the luminal esophageal temperature during radio frequency or cryotherapy&#xD;
      applications; stopping application early if certain temperatures considered risky were&#xD;
      reached. However, the success of luminal esophageal temperature monitoring in preventing&#xD;
      lesions varies widely, given that the temperature probes are very thin with respect to the&#xD;
      total diameter of the esophagus, their position varies with respect to the cardiac tissue&#xD;
      treated, and contact with the esophageal mucosa is inconstant. In fact, it has been reported&#xD;
      that the temperature probes used for monitoring can contribute to increasing thermal lesions,&#xD;
      given that their metal elements can boost direct heating/cooling of the tissue and make the&#xD;
      lesion larger and last longer. In fact, the incidence of esophageal lesions is very similar,&#xD;
      independent of the use of the temperature probe, or if it is a single or multi-sensor.&#xD;
      Another controversial aspect of these temperature probes is that their use can lead to - at&#xD;
      least potentially and in pursuit of safety - shorter, limited applications, which could cause&#xD;
      incomplete non-transmural lesions and hamper the correct treatment of patients, thereby&#xD;
      becoming a factor that increases the recurrence of atrial fibrillation. In addition, these&#xD;
      probes should be deployed during the procedure so they are as close as possible to the&#xD;
      application site (right or left veins depending on the time), which increases the procedure&#xD;
      and fluoroscopy time, with consequent risks for both the patient and the medical team. All&#xD;
      these limitations, together with significant economic cost overruns have meant that the use&#xD;
      of this approach in our care facilities has been minimal and only for research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even if the possible long-term consequences of esophageal lesions are minimal, studying new&#xD;
      strategies for esophageal protection that are easy to implement and do not affect the&#xD;
      efficacy of ablation procedures is of great clinical and scientific interest. In this&#xD;
      context, there is a plan to use the probes to regulate and maintain patient temperature in&#xD;
      prolonged surgeries or critical units as a method of esophageal protection during ablation.&#xD;
      Multiple clinical studies have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of these probes in&#xD;
      different medical/surgical areas. In particular, they are indicated to minimize the&#xD;
      neurological damage associated with heart attacks through the induction of therapeutic&#xD;
      hypothermia. They are also indicated to reduce the temperature of patients with malignant&#xD;
      hyperthermia, to prevent unexpected peri-operative hypothermia, and to reduce elevated&#xD;
      intracranial pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevention of esophageal lesions via temperature control (local cooling of the esophagus&#xD;
      when radiofrequency is used or heating when cryotherapy is used, thanks to various probe&#xD;
      configurations) has been investigated with mathematical models, preclinical models, and in&#xD;
      the clinical field in a preliminary way. Data are available that demonstrate its efficacy in&#xD;
      this approach, although with limitations in the number of cases and the systems used. In most&#xD;
      of these studies, prototypes of anterior probes were used, which are difficult to place and&#xD;
      require changes in the work routine, which has made the expansion of devices using this&#xD;
      approach more difficult up to now.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The appearance of a new, easier-to-use device for esophageal temperature adjustments&#xD;
      (EnsoETM, Attune Medical, Chicago, Illinois, USA) when managing patient temperature for a&#xD;
      large variety of needs has facilitated the reintroduction of this therapeutic option.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EnsoETM, made by Attune Medical, received its CE mark in Europe in 2014, with an expanded&#xD;
      indicated use of up to 120 hours in 2016 and a CE mark for its use with the Altrix system by&#xD;
      Stryker® in 2017. (CE certificate attached.) The EnsoETM is used as part of treatment to&#xD;
      obtain therapeutic hypothermia during the management of a heart attack. It is also used in&#xD;
      the treatment of hyperthermia, the prevention of unexpected peri-operative hypothermia, and&#xD;
      the reduction of elevated intracranial pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The device is situated in the esophagus like a standard orogastric sensor. A multi-channel&#xD;
      cylindrical silicone tube connected to a closed water circuit allows the surrounding tissue&#xD;
      to be warmed or cooled according to the need or desired temperature. This effect is achieved&#xD;
      through the transfer of heat via conduction through the esophagus and by convection through&#xD;
      the device. One must keep in mind that the posterior wall of the left atrium is in close&#xD;
      contact with the esophagus and the modular effect of the temperature therefore also acts on&#xD;
      the wall of the atrium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EnsoETM is designed to use the high-blood-flow surroundings of the esophagus and achieve&#xD;
      high heat-exchange performance. In addition, the EnsoETM has a distal end that reaches the&#xD;
      stomach and allows it to be decompressed, avoiding distension of the esophagus, which ensures&#xD;
      good contact between the device and the esophageal mucosa, thereby maximizing the transfer of&#xD;
      heat between the device and the patient. The EnsoETM is composed of standard medical-grade&#xD;
      silicone, and is generally similar in shape and size to gastric probes and other devices that&#xD;
      are routinely situated in the esophagus (esophagogastroduodenoscopes, transesophageal&#xD;
      echocardiogram probes, Ewald tubes, etc.). It is also smaller than other more aggressive&#xD;
      devices (the EnsoETM measures approximately 1/3 the size of the Sengstaken-Blakemore tube&#xD;
      used to treat esophageal varices).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The preliminary data available show that the use of probes that regulate the esophageal&#xD;
      temperature would allow the mucosa of thermal lesions to be protected, thereby reducing and&#xD;
      preventing lesions on this level during the fibrillation ablation treatment. However, it is&#xD;
      not known whether the modulation of esophageal temperature or contact with the atrial wall&#xD;
      affect the efficacy of the actual lesions induced on the atrium and therefore on the success&#xD;
      of the ablation procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      General hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Esophageal protection probes allow the deleterious effects of pulmonary vein ablation to be&#xD;
      counteracted on the wall of the esophagus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. The incidence of esophageal lesions in our setting, in which a conservative approach is&#xD;
      applied to the ablation of pulmonary veins, is low but not insignificant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2 The use of esophageal protection probes allows the incidence of esophageal lesions to be&#xD;
      decreased.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 The use of esophageal protection probes does not alter the clinical result of the pulmonary&#xD;
      vein ablation procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. GENERAL AND SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assess the role of esophageal protection probes during pulmonary vein ablation procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assess the incidence of esophageal lesions in our setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assess if the use of a probe for esophageal protection reduces the incidence of&#xD;
           esophageal lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assess if the use of esophageal protection probes alters the clinical result of the&#xD;
           pulmonary vein ablation procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a prospective pilot study to assess the incidence of esophageal&#xD;
      lesions following a pulmonary vein ablation procedure in our care center in which a&#xD;
      conservative approach is used to apply the energy. In addition, in a limited number of&#xD;
      patients, the study aims to assess the effect of an esophageal protection probe on the&#xD;
      occurrence of thermal lesions and the results of the ablation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study protocol will be carried out under the directives of the Institutional Ethics&#xD;
      Committee in the Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients referred for catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation (either cryoablation or&#xD;
      radiofrequency ablation (1/1)) will be randomized to either receive or not (1/1) an&#xD;
      esophageal temperature adjustment EnsoETM device, to evaluate its role for esophageal&#xD;
      protection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ablation procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients included in the study will be subject to an ablation procedure following the&#xD;
      standard guidelines in our center with no modification, where the investigators carry out the&#xD;
      procedures under general anesthesia. Instead of using a conventional orogastric probe, the&#xD;
      patients in the probe-evaluation group will systematically use the probe protecting against&#xD;
      thermal lesions with no other variation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use of the EnsoETM esophageal probe:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Placement of the EnsoETM will follow standard recommendations according to the instructions,&#xD;
      which are similar to recommendations for inserting a transesophageal echocardiogram probe&#xD;
      (routine procedure in some centers to guide the transseptal puncture) or the orogastric&#xD;
      aspiration probe during surgical procedures. The EnsoETM will be connected to the appropriate&#xD;
      console (Meditherm, Blanketrol, or Altrix). The configuration will be adjusted according to&#xD;
      the ablation technique (cryoablation or radiofrequency ablation). If radio frequency is used,&#xD;
      before beginning the ablation of the left posterior wall, the heat exchanger connected to the&#xD;
      EnsoETM will be adjusted to a cooling mode (5°C), with ablation beginning at least 1 min&#xD;
      after the circulating water reaches a temperature of 5°C. If cryoablation is used, before&#xD;
      beginning the application, the heat exchanger connected to the EnsoETM will be adjusted to a&#xD;
      heating mode (45°C), with cryoablation beginning at least 1 min after the circulating water&#xD;
      reaches a temperature of 45°C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Esophagogastroscopy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An esophagogastroscopy will be done on all patients, a day later after the catheter ablation,&#xD;
      following the usual guidelines of the Gastroenterology Service. Local anesthesia will be used&#xD;
      with superficial sedation following a 12-hour fast. Basal anticoagulant treatment will be&#xD;
      maintained without any precise antibiotic prophylaxis. The gastroenterologist will provide a&#xD;
      report on the procedure, classifying the findings in agreement with Zargar's criteria,&#xD;
      assessing them qualitatively as light, moderate, or serious. Special focus will be placed on&#xD;
      the anterior zone of the esophagus at the level of the left atrium, which is where the energy&#xD;
      (radio frequency or cryoablation) is applied during the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The usual treatment and controls will both be followed unless the gastroenterologist changes&#xD;
      the recommendations due to the endoscopy findings. Follow-up visits will be made at 1, 3, 6,&#xD;
      and 12 after the procedure to assess the presence of cardiological and gastrointestinal&#xD;
      symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population. The population will consist of patients subjected to their first pulmonary&#xD;
      vein ablation procedure in the left atrium to treat atrial fibrillation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition of variables&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Demographic variables: age, gender, weight, and height&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Clinical variables: cardiovascular risk factors, atrial fibrillation factors (alcohol,&#xD;
           sleep apnea, obesity, …), previous atrial fibrillation arrhythmia, history of&#xD;
           gastrointestinal pathology (reflux, esophagitis, gastritis, H Pylori infection, …),&#xD;
           history of cardiological pathology (basic structural cardiomyopathy: ischemic, valvular,&#xD;
           hypertensive, diameter and volume of the left atrium, ejection fraction, …).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Family history of early atrial fibrillation (&lt;40 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Previous pharmacological treatment: especially anti-arrhythmia, anticoagulant and&#xD;
           anti-secretion or gastric protector (indication, dosage, time, and administration&#xD;
           route).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Effectiveness of pulmonary vein isolation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Radio-physical variables of the ablation (number of applications, duration of&#xD;
           application, maximum or minimum temperature, power (W), ablation index per region&#xD;
           (anterior, posterior).&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Duration of procedure: fluoroscopy, catheterization in the left atrium.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Clinical or electrical efficacy. Recurrence of arrhythmia (palpitations, ECG, or Holter&#xD;
           monitor)&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Esophageal lesions per Zargar endoscopy classification&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Adverse clinical events&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Dysphagia: the patient relates difficulty swallowing for more than 24 hours after&#xD;
                the use of the device; diagnosed via modified barium swallow study,&#xD;
                videofluoroscopic swallow study, or related directly by the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Odynophagia: the patient relates pain when swallowing for more than 24 hours after&#xD;
                the use of the device; diagnosed via the patient's subjective feelings.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Esophageal lesion not due to ablation: evidence of traumatic lesions or other&#xD;
                esophageal lesions diagnosed by a gastroenterologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size and strength Given that the incidence of esophageal lesions in recent studies was&#xD;
      estimated to be 40-50%, and a reduction of 20% was calculated in the appearance of lesions&#xD;
      with the use of the probe compared to control conditions (without modification of the&#xD;
      esophageal temperature), with a power of 80% and an alpha error of 0.05. A necessary sample&#xD;
      size of 28 patients was specified for each of the techniques used (radio frequency and&#xD;
      cryoablation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method. Sources of information The information gathered throughout the study will be&#xD;
      collected in an encrypted database designed and built specifically for the study. Atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation ablation is a common technique in our center, with more than 100 procedures&#xD;
      performed annually.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management and analysis Statistical analysis will be carried out with the statistics&#xD;
      program SPSS, version 25.0 (IBM Corporation). The continuous variables will be expressed as&#xD;
      an average and standard variation or medians and interquartile range, depending on whether&#xD;
      the distribution is statistically different from a normal distribution. Qualitative variables&#xD;
      will be presented as numbers and percentages. To study the relationship between qualitative&#xD;
      variables, the chi-squared test (X2) will be used; Fisher's exact test will be used for&#xD;
      variables that do not follow a normal distribution. The quantitative variables will be&#xD;
      compared using Student's t-test if two groups are compared; analysis of variance (ANOVA) will&#xD;
      be used for more than two groups. If the quantitative variables do not follow a normal&#xD;
      distribution, non-parametric tests will be used: the Mann-Whitney U-test for two groups or&#xD;
      the Kruskal-Wallis test for more than two groups. The correlation between the variables will&#xD;
      be studied using the Pearson or Spearman tests, depending on whether the distribution is&#xD;
      normal or not. Differences with a p-value of 0.05 or higher will be considered significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The only significant change with respect to usual practice is that an upper digestive&#xD;
      endoscopy will be performed on all patients included. However, this activity is not expected&#xD;
      to lead to a change in the length of admission or in the treatment administered. Although it&#xD;
      is a new element, the introduction of the probe is not expected to lead to significant&#xD;
      changes, since all patients are intubated in the usual way and, based on need, a nasogastric&#xD;
      probe of reduced size will simultaneously be introduced in the same way as the study probe to&#xD;
      avoid gastric distension.&#xD;
