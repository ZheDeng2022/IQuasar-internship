    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a drug combination as a possible treatment for endometrial&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drugs involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  mirvetuximab soravtansine (IMGN853)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  pembrolizumab&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a&#xD;
      specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved mirvetuximab soravtansine as&#xD;
      a treatment for any disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved pembrolizumab for this&#xD;
      specific disease but it has been approved for other uses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the investigators are studying the combination of mirvetuximab&#xD;
      soravtansine and pembrolizumab. Pembrolizumab is an immunotherapy that activates a patient's&#xD;
      own immune system to recognize and kill tumor cells. Pembrolizumab by itself may not be&#xD;
      enough to kill cancer cells in all people with cancer. In this study, all patients will&#xD;
      receive mirvetuximab soravtansine and pembrolizumab. Mirvetuximab soravtansine is an&#xD;
      antibody-drug conjugate. That is a type of agent that attaches a chemotherapy drug to a&#xD;
      molecule that binds a protein on the outside of cancer cells. The protein targeted by&#xD;
      mirvetuximab soravtansine is called folate receptor-alpha (FRα). FRα is expressed on the&#xD;
      surface of certain cancers, including endometrial cancer cells. Mirvetuximab soravtansine is&#xD;
      expected to kill cancer cells by delivering chemotherapy to cells that have high levels of&#xD;
      FRα. To participate in this study, a sample of your tumor was previously tested, and was&#xD;
      found to have high levels of FRα. Mirvetuximab soravtansine also may also active immune cells&#xD;
      and improve the response to immunotherapies like pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators expect to learn whether the combination of pembrolizumab and&#xD;
      mirvetuximab soravtansine can shrink endometrial cancers or prevent their growth for at least&#xD;
      6 months. The investigators will also learn more about the side effects patients experience&#xD;
      who receive this treatment. The investigators also plan to learn more about which patients&#xD;
      are likely to benefit from this treatment&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have advanced or recurrent serous endometrial cancer. Patients with&#xD;
             mixed histologies/tumors are eligible if the serous component is the dominant&#xD;
             histological subtype. In addition, the tumors must be:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  microsatellite stable (MSS) as documented by either intact immunohistochemical (IHC)&#xD;
             nuclear expression of the mismatch repair genes MSH2, MSH6, MLH1 and PMS2; or&#xD;
             microsatelitte stable by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), next generation sequencing,&#xD;
             or other CLIA-approved method;&#xD;
&#xD;
        AND&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  FRα positive by central immunohistochemistry (IHC, Section 9.1). If archival tissue&#xD;
             does not meet FRα criteria, a fresh biopsy tumor sample may be submitted and used to&#xD;
             meet this criterium. If a fresh tumor biopsy cannot be done safely the patient will&#xD;
             not be allowed to enroll on this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Participants must have measurable disease as defined by RECIST 1.1. Lesions&#xD;
                  situated in a previously irradiated area are considered measurable if progression&#xD;
                  has been demonstrated in such lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Prior therapy: Patients must have had one, but no more than three lines of&#xD;
                  chemotherapy for endometrial carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior hormonal therapy is allowed (no washout period is required after hormonal&#xD;
             therapy) and does not count as a prior line of therapy. Hormonal therapy in&#xD;
             combination with CDK4/6 inhibitors or mTOR or other PI3K-pathway inhibitors is allowed&#xD;
             and does not count as a line of prior therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must NOT have received any class of drugs targeted to the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway&#xD;
             or folate receptor orthologs.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Age 18 or greater years. Because insufficient dosing or adverse event data are&#xD;
                  currently available on the use of mirvetuximab soravtansine and pembrolizumab in&#xD;
                  participants &lt;18 years of age, children are excluded. Endometrial cancer is rare&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤2.5 × institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  creatinine ≤ institutional upper limit of normal OR&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  creatinine clearance ≥40 mL/min/1.73 m2 for participants with creatinine levels above&#xD;
             institutional normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -Time from prior therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Systemic anti-neoplastic therapy: 5 half-lives or 4 weeks, whichever is shorter.&#xD;
             Hormonal therapy is not considered anti-neoplastic therapy.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  The effects of agents used in this study on the developing human fetus are&#xD;
                  unknown. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential must agree to use&#xD;
                  adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence)&#xD;
                  prior to study entry, during study treatment, and for at least twelve weeks after&#xD;
                  the last dose of study treatment. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she&#xD;
                  is pregnant while she is participating in this study, she should inform her&#xD;
                  treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within&#xD;
                  3 days prior to the first dose of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent&#xD;

          -  Participants who have had chemotherapy within 5 half-lives or 4 weeks (whichever is&#xD;
             shorter) or radiotherapy within 2 weeks prior to entering the study. Patients&#xD;
             completing wide-field radiotherapy (e.g. &gt;30% of marrow-bearing bones) must not have&#xD;
             had treatment within 4 weeks prior to entering study. Participants must have recovered&#xD;
             from all AEs due to previous therapy to Grade 1 ≤ or baseline, except alopecia.&#xD;
&#xD;

             (note that the repeat imaging should be performed during study screening), clinically&#xD;
             stable and without requirement of steroid treatment for at least 14 days prior to&#xD;
             first dose of study treatment.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, any of the following&#xD;
             within 6 months of first study treatment: symptomatic congestive heart failure,&#xD;
             unstable angina pectoris, uncontrolled hypertension (≥ Grade 3), hypertensive crisis&#xD;
             or hypertensive encephalopathy, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmias, thrombotic or&#xD;
             ischemic stroke, clinically-significant vascular disease (e.g. aortic aneurysm, or&#xD;
             dissecting aneurysm), severe aortic stenosis, clinically significant peripheral&#xD;
             vascular disease, or ≥ Grade 3 cardiac toxicity following prior chemotherapy, cardiac&#xD;

             presence of papilledema, and acquired monocular vision.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serious clinically-relevant active infection, including known HIV infection,&#xD;
             varicella-zoster virus, cytomegalovirus infection, has a known history of Hepatitis B&#xD;

             Calmette-Guérin (BCG), and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection&#xD;
             are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza&#xD;
