      This is four arm study. Approximately 480 (120 per group) would need to complete the 12 weeks&#xD;
      of treatments.In order to achieve that number of subjects, approximately 700 subjects will be&#xD;
      screened randomized into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A screening visit (Visit 1) will be followed by at least 2 weeks (14 days) placebo Run-in&#xD;
      Period during which asthma subjects will wash out their daily inhaled corticosteroid and&#xD;
      other medications and be assessed for compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study treatment period will be for a duration of 12 weeks with visits: Visit 2- Baseline Day&#xD;
      1, Visit 3 Day 21 (± 2 days), Visit 4 Day 42 (± 2 days), Visit 5 Day 63 (± 2 days), and Visit&#xD;
      6 Day 84 days (± 2 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rescue Therapy: Short-acting beta agonists, Albuterol 90 μg/actuation.&#xD;
