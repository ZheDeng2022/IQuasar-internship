      Parkinson disease is the second most frequent neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer&#xD;
      disease and affect 1% of the population over 60 years. The treatment of PD is based on&#xD;
      dopamine replacement therapies (DRT). Nausea is the most frequent adverse event whatever the&#xD;
      drug, occurring in 30-40% of patients at the initiation of DRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Domperidone, a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist with antiemetic properties, does not readily&#xD;
      cross the blood-brain barrier, allowing its used in PD. Domperidone may prolong the duration&#xD;
      of the QT interval in predisposed patients, and has been associated with proarrhythmia and&#xD;
      arrhythmic deaths. Arrhythmias, sudden death and cardiac arrest were reported with high&#xD;
      intravenous doses which has led to withdraw of the parenteral form of the drug in 1984. Two&#xD;
      case control studies found an increased risk of sudden death associated with domperidone use.&#xD;
      In these reports, the increased risk was depending on age, dose, and the use of domperidone&#xD;
      in combination with CYP3A4 inhibitors. Following the discussion created by this alert, the&#xD;
      PRAC of the EMA has issued recommendations restricting domperidone use to patients younger&#xD;
      than 60 years at doses below 30 mg/day and for a short period (7 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because there is no alternative antiemetic drug to be used in PD, domperidone is commonly&#xD;
      prescribed as a preventive therapy in most PD patients initiating DRT. In this population,&#xD;
      usually older than 60 years, doses of 60 or 80 mg/day are commonly prescribed, for at least 2&#xD;
      months of the DRT escalating dose period or longer. A particular &quot;niche&quot; of domperidone&#xD;
      misuse might be patients treated with continuous subcutaneous administration of apomorphine,&#xD;
      a second line therapy in PD, inducing severe and prolonged nausea in almost all patients.&#xD;
      Little is known about the use of domperidone in PD in France, but misuse of domperidone in PD&#xD;
      patients is probably very high. Data collected from two French PD cohorts, COPARK and DIGPD,&#xD;
      showed that 8-14% of PD patients were treated with domperidone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this proposal is to investigate the practices and beliefs of French neurologists&#xD;
      regarding use and misuse of domperidone in PD, by a qualitative approach.&#xD;

      Parkinson disease is the second most frequent neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer&#xD;
      disease and affect 1% of the population over 60 years (150 to 170 000 patients in France).&#xD;
      The treatment of PD is based on dopamine replacement therapies (DRT). Nausea is the most&#xD;
      frequent adverse event whatever the drug, occurring in 30-40% of patients at the initiation&#xD;
      of DRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Domperidone is a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist with antiemetic properties. Domperidone does&#xD;
      not readily cross the blood-brain barrier, allowing its used in PD. Domperidone may prolong&#xD;
      the duration of the QT interval in predisposed patients, and has been associated with&#xD;
      proarrhythmia and arrhythmic deaths. Arrhythmias, sudden death and cardiac arrest were&#xD;
      reported with high intravenous doses which has led to withdraw of the parenteral form of the&#xD;
      drug in 1984. More recently, two case control studies found an increased risk of sudden death&#xD;
      associated with domperidone use. In these reports, the increased risk was depending on age,&#xD;
      dose, and the use of domperidone in combination with CYP3A4 inhibitors. Following the&#xD;
      discussion created by this alert, the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) of&#xD;
      the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has issued recommendations restricting domperidone use to&#xD;
      patients younger than 60 years at doses below 30 mg/day and for a short period (7 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because there is no alternative antiemetic drug to be used in PD, domperidone is commonly&#xD;
      prescribed as a preventive therapy in most PD patients initiating DRT since more than 30&#xD;
      years. In this population, usually older than 60 years, doses of 60 or 80 mg/day are commonly&#xD;
      prescribed, for at least 2 months of the DRT escalating dose period or longer. A particular&#xD;
      &quot;niche&quot; of domperidone misuse might be patients treated with continuous subcutaneous&#xD;
      administration of apomorphine, a second line therapy in PD, inducing severe and prolonged&#xD;
      nausea in almost all patients. Little is known about the use of domperidone in PD in France&#xD;
      in clinical practice, but misuse of domperidone in PD patients is probably very high. Data&#xD;
      collected from two French PD cohorts, COPARK and DIGPD, showed that 8-14% of PD patients were&#xD;
      treated with domperidone, extrapolating 10,000 to 20,000 potentially exposed patients at&#xD;
      particularly high risk of sudden death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this proposal is to investigate the practices and beliefs of French neurologists&#xD;
      regarding use and misuse of domperidone in PD, by a qualitative approach. Practices of&#xD;
      domperidone prescription by neurologists (from university and general hospitals and private&#xD;
      offices) will be evaluated using a semi-structured questionnaire survey. This qualitative&#xD;
      study will provide insights from the neurologists on their need for domperidone, therapeutic&#xD;
      alternatives and their perceived efficacy, and on the domperidone management and safety&#xD;
      procedures that are applied to PD patients before and after domperidone prescription.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this survey on regular practices of neurologists on the use and misuse of&#xD;
      domperidone will provide information of the current opinions about the drug, the indications&#xD;
      for which it is prescribed, how contra-indications are evaluated, and their feedback on&#xD;
      tolerance and efficacy. This information will help Regulatory Authorities to communicate&#xD;
      about the safety profile of the drug.&#xD;
