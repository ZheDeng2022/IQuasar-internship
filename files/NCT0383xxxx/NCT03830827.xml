  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter, double-blind, Randomized, parallel-group study in subjects with&#xD;
      methamphetamine dependence was to assess the efficacy of MBRP combined with vortioxetine and&#xD;
      MBRP alone on 24-week abstinence rates, improvement of cognition and depressive symptoms.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants who allocate to the experimental group will receive 8-week 10-20mg/day&#xD;
      vortioxetine combined with MBRP intervention. Participants who allocate to the control group&#xD;
      will receive 8-week 1-2#/day placebo combined with MBRP intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vortioxetine (Brintellix®), a novel antidepressant for the treatment of adult with major&#xD;
      depressive disorder, has been approved by the Chinese Food and Drug Administration in the use&#xD;
      of China in 2018.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MBRP intervention is composed of 8 weekly, 2-hour sessions delivered in small group&#xD;
      format (10-14 participants) by two therapists to prevent MA relapse. In MBRP, therapists&#xD;
      facilitate discussions and exercises and introduce the meditation practice component. Group&#xD;
      sessions include discussions of mindfulness as a means of coping with MA craving, negative&#xD;
      affect and painful cognitions/sensations that precipitate relapse, role-playing exercises,&#xD;
      meditation practice and implement practice into high-risk situations and in daily life, as&#xD;
      well as homework assignments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants from both groups will also receive 10 visits: visit 1 (week 0): medical and&#xD;
      psychiatric screening; visit 2-9 (week 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8): depressive symptoms and&#xD;
      cognitive function, MA use, and MA craving; visit 10 (week 24): MA use (assessment of relapse&#xD;
      rates), assessment of depressive symptoms, improvement in cognition and MA craving.&#xD;

    <measure>The Timeline Followback (TLFB) for MA relapse rates</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The primary objective is Methamphetamine (MA) relapse rates will be assessed by the Timeline Follow Back (TFB) at weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 24. TLFB is a technique for assessing self-reported alcohol or drug consumption that can be used as a clinical and research tool to obtain a variety of quantitative estimates of MA use. This outcome measure integrates data from self-reported supplied in the Time Line Follow Back (a self-reported summary of all substance use over the previous week) with biological verification.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Depressive symptoms will be assessed by Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS, Chinese version)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The efficacy of intervention for depressive symptoms was measured by mean change in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) depression score from Baseline (Visit 2) to Week 24 (Visit 10). MADRS is a 10-item rating scale designed to measure overall severity of the symptoms in depressive and to be sensitive to treatment effects. Symptoms are rated on a 7-point Likert scale from 0 (no symptom) to 6 (severe symptom) with an overall score range from 0 to 60. Participants were considered responsive to vortioxetine if their MADRS score decreased by 50% or more from baseline to the end of treatment，and to be in remission if their final MADRS score is less than 10. A higher score indicates a more severe symptom, and a lower score from the baseline indicates an improvement in symptoms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cognition function will be assessed by THINC-it® cognition screening tool</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>THINC-it® is a sensitive cognitive screening tool for measuring the change of cognitive function and determining whether cognitive function is impaired. It required approximately 10 to 15 minutes for administration. It includes variants of the Choice Reaction Time Identification Task (IDN), One-Back Test, Digit Symbol Substitution Test, Trail Making Test-Part B, and the Perceived Deficits Questionnaire for Depression-5-item (PDQ-5-D).</description>
