    <textblock>
      This study has been expanded to a four center, open-label,2-group randomized pilot study&#xD;
      evaluating a treatment for obesity. The intent is to evaluate the safety and preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy of a new Snowshoe suture placement pattern, Pose 2 (sutures placed in the mid +&#xD;
      distal body without fundus), with a moderate intensity diet and exercise program, as compared&#xD;
      to diet and exercise alone. The procedure will be performed using the g-Cath EZ Delivery&#xD;
      Catheter with Snowshoe Suture Anchors (AKA g-Cath or g-Cath EZ) and associated devices&#xD;
      (g-Prox EZ, g-Lix and Transport), known collectively as the Incisionless Operating Platform&#xD;
      (IOP). Efficacy will be evaluated based on changes in weight loss for all subjects through 12&#xD;
      months. Adverse events will be recorded throughout the duration of the study.&#xD;
