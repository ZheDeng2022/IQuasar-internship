      PURPOSE AND AIMS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 1 - To evaluate the effect of deep brain stimulation (DBS) vs best medical treatment&#xD;
           in essential tremor (ET) in a randomized, single-blinded controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 2 - To compare the effect of DBS in the established target in the ventrolateral&#xD;
           (VL)-thalamus/ nucleus ventralis intermedius thalami (Vim) and in a new target in the&#xD;
           posterior subthalamic area (PSA)/caudal Zona incerta (cZi).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 3 - To map the target area in the VL-thalamus and PSA concerning effects and side&#xD;
           effects of stimulation in order to identify and delineate the optimal target.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 4 - To evaluate the long-term effects of DBS for ET in a longitudinal non-randomized&#xD;
           evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SURVEY OF THE FIELD Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) In DBS, thin quadripolar electrode leads&#xD;
      (with four 1.5 mm long and 1.27 mm thick contacts, separated by 1.5 mm space), connected to a&#xD;
      neuropacemaker are implanted with stereotactic technique into the central parts of the brain&#xD;
      where the neuronal activity is modulated with electrical current. DBS has revolutionized the&#xD;
      treatment of Parkinson´s disease and other movement disorders, and more than 150.000 patients&#xD;
      have so far been operated. Currently, new indications and targets are emerging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, many of the brain targets subjected for DBS are not well defined, and one of the&#xD;
      main problem with DBS is likely to be the high number of suboptimal placed electrodes with&#xD;
      lack of effect, unacceptable side effects and costly revisions. Further, even though this is&#xD;
      an invasive and highly resource demanding therapy, most clinical indications for DBS (asides&#xD;
      from Parkinson´s disease and dystonia) are not evidence based. They are considered as&#xD;
      &quot;established treatments&quot; and often provided as clinical treatment and not within the context&#xD;
      of trials or scientific studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DBS for Essential Tremor ET is the most common adult movement disorder with a prevalence of&#xD;
      about 5% in the population above 65 years of age. Of patients who seek medical care up to 50%&#xD;
      do not respond adequately to drug therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The thalamic nucleus ventralis intermedius (Vim) is the projection structure of the&#xD;
      cerebello-thalamic fibers mediating tremor. Hence, Vim has been an &quot;established&quot; target for&#xD;
      surgical treatment of ET during the thalamotomy era, and when DBS was introduced and replaced&#xD;
      thalamotomy, the Vim was logically the target for DBS for tremor. However, data from recent&#xD;
      years indicate that it might not be stimulation of the Vim itself, but rather, the&#xD;
      stimulation was affecting the pathologic tremor oscillations mediated by the&#xD;
      cerebello-thalamic-cortical projections, located in the PSA and the caudal zona incerta&#xD;
      (cZi). Thus, a number of studies have demonstrated that electrode contacts that reach the PSA&#xD;
      have a better effect on tremor than those located more dorsally-rostrally in the Vim. This&#xD;
      subthalamic area, which is situated immediately ventral-caudal to the Vim, is particularly&#xD;
      dense with cerebello-thalamic axons, dispersing into the Vim. Stimulation is thus likely to&#xD;
      involve more axons in the PSA than in the Vim, since these axons in the PSA constitute so to&#xD;
      speak a bottle neck of the axonal traffic mediating tremor. It is also plausible that&#xD;
      stimulation of axons rather than stimulation of nuclei actually affects by antidromic and&#xD;
      orthodromic propagation more neurons and therefore also alters tremor oscillations more&#xD;
      efficiently. A number of studies directly targeting the cZi have also recently presented&#xD;
      results comparing favorably with the results published for Vim DBS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Level of evidence regarding DBS in ET:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neither the Vim nor the cZi are evidence based targets, and there are no evidence-based DBS&#xD;
      procedures for ET (level IV evidence only), even though this is the second most common&#xD;
      indication for DBS. However, the Vim is by tradition the established target for ET and the&#xD;
      procedure is recommended in the Swedish guidelines for treatment of tremor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of Vim DBS ET have been demonstrated in a number of uncontrolled, mostly minor&#xD;
      studies. A problem is that many of these studies are likely to contain electrodes placed&#xD;
      blindly within the PSA36 and that the actual location of the active electrode contacts of the&#xD;
      DBS lead is seldom taken into consideration. Further, many reports lack a preoperative&#xD;
      baseline and the results are often reported in a heterogeneous manner, making comparison&#xD;
      between different studies difficult. Regarding cZi DBS, excluding our own studies, the&#xD;
      results of cZi DBS in 33 patients have been presented in five small and non-randomized&#xD;
      studies. Concerning the relative merits of the two targets, we have previously presented a&#xD;
      tremor reduction of 86 % following cZi, compared to only 60% in the Vim4, and demonstrated&#xD;
      that the electrode contacts with the best effect in what was called Vim were often placed in&#xD;
      the PSA. There is further a scarcity of long-term data regarding both targets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identifying the brain target in the individual patient In a recent study of 28 000&#xD;
      procedures, electrode revisions constituted up to one third of all DBS procedures. It is&#xD;
      likely that misplaced electrodes due to difficulties in identifying the target is one of the&#xD;
      major causes explaining a poor result in DBS for movement disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are a number of different ways in which the target can be identified. Even for brain&#xD;
      targets that can be visually identified on MRI, some centers rely mostly on statistical&#xD;
      coordinates of the targets based on anatomical atlases, but this may result in poorly placed&#xD;
      electrodes, due to significant inter-individual differences in the anatomy. However,&#xD;
      concerning the Vim, identification of that target in relation to ventricular landmarks is a&#xD;
      necessity since the Vim cannot be visualized as such in MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, 60 % of the centers are relying on micro-electrode recording (MER) in order to&#xD;
      identify the target in the individual patient. This is an invasive neurophysiological method&#xD;
      necessitating considerable resources. It is also associated with an increased risk of&#xD;
      hemorrhages, since it involves introducing several sharp cannulas and electrodes into the&#xD;
      target area. The third method is visual anatomical targeting, whereby the target is&#xD;
      identified on the patients´ MRI, either directly or in relation to visible very closely&#xD;
      related landmarks (Figure 2). We have over the years made significant contributions in the&#xD;
      development of this last method, both concerning the pallidum, STN and cZi. Unfortunately&#xD;
      this method demands a high level of dedication and relies to a high degree on personal&#xD;
      experience. Scientifically based guidelines delineating the target areas and identifying the&#xD;
      optimal target do not readily exist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Common for all different methods is that it is normally required that the patient is awake&#xD;
      during surgery in order to allow for intra-operative testing of effect/side effects, even if&#xD;
      some today perform the procedure in general anesthesia concerning some of the targets. If the&#xD;
      brain targets could be identified with a high degree of certainty, and the electrode position&#xD;
      within that target can be verified during surgery, then having the patients awake during&#xD;
      surgery would no longer be necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identifying and delineating the optimal targets The literature regarding optimal target&#xD;
      point/volume for the different targets is surprisingly meagre. The most common target, the&#xD;
      subthalamic nucleus (STN), is also the most studied regarding this issue, but the effect has&#xD;
      been evaluated in relation to the location of the electrode in no more than 260 patients in a&#xD;
      total of 13 different studies. Interestingly, most of these studies have found that the best&#xD;
      effect is not achieved in the target structure itself, but in another adjacent structure, the&#xD;
      more rostral part of the Zona incerta overlying the STN. The same is true regarding the few&#xD;
      studies of thalamic surgery for tremor, where most have demonstrated that the best effect is&#xD;
      achieved from contacts outside the thalamic target, in the PSA. Concerning other&#xD;
      targets/indications the literature is even more limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The existing studies are further hampered by the heterogeneity of the methods. Often it is&#xD;
      not the actual location of the electrode that is reported, but the intended one. Even when&#xD;
      the actual location is reported it is most often presented according to distant landmarks,&#xD;
      even if the targeting was done visually, which is a significant problem, taking into&#xD;
      consideration the inter-individual variability. Further, even though the stimulation&#xD;
      parameters used can differ widely and hence the electrical current affect different&#xD;
      neighboring structures, this is virtually never taken into account.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DBS for ET - Conclusions and aim DBS for ET is thus not an evidence based therapy and the&#xD;
      same is true regarding both target areas used for ET. The relative merits of the different&#xD;
      targets used have not been clearly demonstrated and the individual targets are not well&#xD;
      delineated. There is thus a need to address these issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overview - What are we going to study? The effect of DBS for ET will be evaluated in a&#xD;
      multicentre study recruiting 100 patients randomized to immediate surgery (group A) or best&#xD;
      medical treatment only (as decided by the movement disorder neurologist, with few exceptions&#xD;
      likely to be identical to their current medication) with delayed surgery at 6 months if still&#xD;
      needed /indicated (group B). Primary outcome is tremor reduction as measured with Essential&#xD;
      tremor rating scale11 (ETRS), with focus on items 5/6 (hand tremor) &amp; 11-14 (hand function),&#xD;
      at baseline before surgery and at 6 months. Secondary outcome includes the essential tremor&#xD;
      rating assessment scale (TETRAS), quality of life measured with QUEST and electrical energy&#xD;
      consumption18. After 6 months group B is operated -as indicated-, and group A and B are&#xD;
      thereafter evaluated as one single group for long-term effects and analyses of electrode&#xD;
      location. The electrodes will in all patients be inserted with a trajectory developed for&#xD;
      this study allowing stimulation both in the established and traditionally used target Vim as&#xD;
      well as in the new target cZi. Each contact will be evaluated individually concerning&#xD;
      location, effects and side effects, in relation to stimulation parameters. This is done in&#xD;
      order to, a) compare the two targets, but more importantly, b) to create a map of the whole&#xD;
      area with identification/delineation of the optimal target point/volume. The time necessary&#xD;
      to gather 100 patients is estimated to 2.5 - 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Step 1 is designed as a randomized controlled trial in order to compare the effect of&#xD;
           DBS (Group A) and medical treatment (Group B) on ET (Aim 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In step 2 - 4 the patients in group A are operated and group A and B joined into one&#xD;
           single group.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Step 2 - all electrode contacts are individually analysed regarding chronic and&#xD;
                acute stimulation effects in relation to their location in either the Vim or the&#xD;
                cZi in order to decide which target is more effective (Aim 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Step 3 - Effects and side effects, with consideration to field of stimulation, are&#xD;
                analyzed in relation to neighboring structures in order to map the whole area and&#xD;
                delineate the optimal target points (Aim 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Step 4 - The long-term effect is evaluated in a non-randomized longitudinal study&#xD;
                at 1, 3, 5, 10 years (Aim 4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size and power:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In step 1, with a confidence interval of 95%, and an expected improvement of 85 % in the&#xD;
      surgical group and none (or at least &lt; 25%) in the medical group, regarding contralateral&#xD;
      items 5/6 &amp; 11-14, a power of 100 % is achieved. In step 2, with an expected improvement of&#xD;
      85% in one target and 60% in the other, a power of 98% is achieved. The high number of&#xD;
      patients is, however, necessary for step 3, mapping of the area, in order to give a good&#xD;
      cover of the periphery (Length of contact carrying electrode surface 7.5 mm, expected mean&#xD;
      non-random intended deviation from target point (as defined in the study) 1 mm, expected mean&#xD;
      random deviation from intended target point 1.5 mm). Based on the previous experience, less&#xD;
      than 5% of patients is expected to be lost during the follow up, which will have an&#xD;
      insignificant effect on the power.&#xD;
