  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgery is currently the only potentially curative treatment modality for localized&#xD;
      retroperitoneal sarcoma (RPS). Available studies regarding oncologic outcomes are mainly&#xD;
      retrospective in nature, and RPS are recognized as a rare disease. Therefore, prospective&#xD;
      analysis of high quality data is a top priority.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to prospectively collect standardized clinical data and radiological and pathological&#xD;
           material from primary RPS patients treated with surgery at reference centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  patient outcome will be evaluated in terms of overall survival (OS), disease-free&#xD;
           survival (DFS), crude cumulative incidence (CCI) of local recurrence (LR) and distant&#xD;
           metastasis (DM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to estimate the efficacy and safety of surgical treatment, including extended surgical&#xD;
           approach to primary RPS;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to prospectively evaluate the impact of multimodality therapy, including radiation&#xD;
           therapy and chemotherapy;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to identify clinical, radiological and pathological characteristics that may influence&#xD;
           the oncological outcome or may be used as predictors of LR/DM/OS. These may be important&#xD;
           biomarkers of disease;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to utilize collected pathological material for research collaborations.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Retroperitoneal sarcomas (RPS) are rare tumors accounting for 10-15% of all soft tissue&#xD;
      sarcomas (STS). They arise between retroperitoneal organs and among vital structures (ie&#xD;
      major abdominal vessels) in an anatomical compartment that is not readily accessible by&#xD;
      physical examination. Four main histotypes account for about 80% of all cases:&#xD;
      well-differentiated liposarcoma (WDLPS), dedifferentiated liposarcoma (DDLPS), leiomyosarcoma&#xD;
      (LMS) and solitary fibrous tumor (SFT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compared to sarcomas at other anatomic sites, RPS are burdened by a higher local recurrence&#xD;
      (LR) rate (50% at 5 years) and a poorer overall survival (OS) rate (50% at 5-years). The&#xD;
      natural history of RPS as a whole group reflects the strong tendency of lipomatous tumors&#xD;
      (WDLPS and DDLPS, which account for about 50% of RPS) to recur locally. Indeed, outcome of&#xD;
      primary RPS is highly related to the histological subtype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WDLPS are characterized by a relatively lower LR rate, negligible metastatic potential and a&#xD;
      favorable overall survival. These tumors however, still may recur locally even years after&#xD;
      the primary resection. Intermediate grade DDLPS are characterized by a strong tendency to&#xD;
      recur locally and low metastatic potential. High grade DDLPS has a high risk of both local&#xD;
      recurrence and distant metastasis. LMS are usually intermediate or high-grade tumors with a&#xD;
      strong tendency to develop distant metastasis; with an adequate resection, it is relatively&#xD;
      common to obtain a durable local control. Classic SFT usually fare well after surgery, with a&#xD;
      low rate of local recurrence and distant metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Historically, surgery emerged as the only potentially curative option in the localized&#xD;
      setting. In the last few years there has been lively debate as to how far should a surgeon&#xD;
      resect in order to obtain a margin that could be considerate adequate. This issue is&#xD;
      particularly challenging in this anatomical compartment where widening the surgical margins&#xD;
      means resecting adjacent organs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since 2002 an 'extended' surgical approach has been proposed for primary RPS patients. The&#xD;
      concept was that surgical margins could be improved by encompassing the tumor with en-bloc&#xD;
      resection of adjacent organs. The aim was to obtain reduced local recurrence and improved&#xD;
      survival. This approach has proven to be effective. In particular, this surgical approach has&#xD;
      been supported by an experimental model, retrospective comparisons, pathology studies&#xD;
      demonstrating adjacent organ involvement, and reports of high rates of residual tumor at&#xD;
      re-excision after conventional (non-extended) primary surgery. Finally, this approach has&#xD;
      been shown to be safe after both short and long term follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiotherapy is an option for RPS, especially in the preoperative setting, but currently the&#xD;
      best evidence for efficacy comes form retrospective, mainly single-center, small size series.&#xD;
      The results of such studies are controversial and high quality data are lacking. A randomized&#xD;
      prospective study led by EORTC (STRASS) is ongoing but results are not expected for several&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of chemotherapy in the localized disease is also still under investigation,&#xD;
      especially in high grade tumors. So far, there is no agreement on the optimal treatment&#xD;
      strategy, even within reference centers, regarding the use of both chemo- and radiotherapy.&#xD;
      In the recent years European and North-American centers joined the panel of expert and this&#xD;
      led to the formation of the TransAtlantic Retroperitoneal Sarcoma Working Group (TARPSWG),&#xD;
      which now consists of more than 50 representatives from sarcoma centers from all over the&#xD;
      world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this collaboration is to expand the knowledge of the disease and formulate shared,&#xD;
      standardized principles of treatment. A retrospective study has been carried out and recently&#xD;
      published by the group to better define patients' outcome and prognostic factors after&#xD;
      surgical resection of primary tumors. Other retrospective studies have been published&#xD;
      focusing on post-relapse outcome, postsurgical morbidity and local recurrence treatment. This&#xD;
      collaboration has also just recently led to the development of consensus guidelines for the&#xD;
      treatment of primary and recurrent and metastatic RPS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To take advantage of the group collaboration, TARPSWG promoted a prospective collection of&#xD;
      clinical, radiological and pathologic data for RPS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is aimed to prospectively collect standardized clinical data and radiological and&#xD;
      pathological material from primary RPS patients treated with surgery at reference centers.&#xD;
      Patient outcome will be evaluated in terms of overall survival (OS), disease-free survival&#xD;
      (DFS), crude cumulative incidence (CCI) of local recurrence (LR) and distant metastasis (DM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, multicentric observational study under the supervision of TARPSWG&#xD;
      (TransAtlantic Retroperitoneal Sarcoma Working Group) aimed to prospectively collect clinical&#xD;
      data and prospectively store radiological and pathological material from patients affected by&#xD;
      primary RPS treated with surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with a diagnosis of primary RPS who meet the eligibility criteria will be invited to&#xD;
      participate to the current study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will receive full information on the type of surgery proposed and on the&#xD;
      data and material (radiological and pathological) that will be collected. Eligible and&#xD;
      informed patients who give their consent to participate will be included in the Prospective&#xD;
      Cohort Study (PCS) and will be followed-up prospectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A data collection form including patient and tumor-related factors, treatment variables,&#xD;
      follow-up findings, development of and time to local recurrence and status at follow-up has&#xD;
      been constructed and shared among all the participating centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participating reference center will individually be able to have access to both cross&#xD;
      sectional imaging (CT or MRI images) and pathological material (a representative formalin&#xD;
      block of the tumor). Whenever possible patient identifiers will be removed and patient&#xD;
      confidentiality will be maintained. Any data shared between institutions will be deidentified&#xD;
      and all measures to conceal patient identifiers will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each center will be responsible for data-entry and storage of its own patients' data,&#xD;
      radiological examinations and pathological samples. At the time of the analysis each center&#xD;
      is committed to provide the requested updated data to the group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up will be based on clinical evaluation and on cross sectional imaging (CT scan of the&#xD;
      thorax and abdomen and/or contrast enhanced MRI of the abdomen) every 4 months for the first&#xD;
      2 years, every 6 months until the 5th year and yearly thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall duration of the project has not been fixed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of patients we plan to include in this prospective multicenter study will be 400&#xD;
      patients per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS Continuous variables will be summarized with appropriate summary&#xD;
      statistics such as the mean, median, standard deviation, minimum and maximum. Categorical&#xD;
      variables will be tabulated with frequencies and percentages. We will evaluate OS, DFS, CCI&#xD;
      of DM and LR and correlate this with clinicopathologic factors such as histology, grade, type&#xD;
      of surgery, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA COLLECTION Data entry will be performed by every participating center. Data will be&#xD;
      collected in a standardized database, stored by every participating center, and shared with&#xD;
      the group at the time of future studies. Data shared between institutions will be&#xD;
      deidentified and whenever possible all measures to conceal patient identifiers and maintain&#xD;
      patient confidentiality will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICS It is the responsibility of the investigator to have prospective approval of the trial&#xD;
      protocol, informed consent forms, and other relevant documents, from the IRB/IEC. All&#xD;
      correspondence with the IRB/IEC should be retained in the Investigator File.&#xD;
