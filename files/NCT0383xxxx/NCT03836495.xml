  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Wheat and wheat derived products are highly consumed around the world. They constitute the&#xD;
      major dietary source of protein and energy for many individuals. Wheat contains moderate&#xD;
      quantity of low quality protein lacking in some essential amino acids, primarily lysine, thus&#xD;
      wheat based diets can't sustain optimal growth, and accordingly should be supplemented with&#xD;
      lysine or complemented by another protein source of better quality to match human needs.&#xD;
      However, human studies showed that wheat flour fortification with lysine was able to slightly&#xD;
      improve growth, namely by increasing weight gain, but it did not however completely reverse&#xD;
      growth impairment provoked by the consumption of wheat-based diets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators developed interest in the role of phosphorus in health and diseased and&#xD;
      believe that the modest impact of lysine fortification may due to low phosphorus availability&#xD;
      of wheat products. Phosphorus content of cereals is mainly in the form of phytate that is not&#xD;
      bioavailable. Supplementing a wheat gluten based diet with a combination of lysine and&#xD;
      phosphorus was able to highly amplify the increase in weight gain and energy efficiency of&#xD;
      rats as compared to lysine or phosphorus supplementation alone. Phosphorus is an essential&#xD;
      mineral known to be directly involved in the production of ATP, which is essential for many&#xD;
      metabolic processes including protein synthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators believe that a better approach to enhance the quality of a wheat-based diet&#xD;
      is through the supplementation with a combination of both lysine and phosphorus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study is designed to investigate the effect of white flour fortification with&#xD;
      lysine and/or phosphorus on sensory properties, postprandial glycaemia and insulinemia, as&#xD;
      well as postprandial thermogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most specifically, we aim to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine the acceptability and assess sensory differences of the fortified breads.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine the glycemic response after ingestion of the different fortified breads.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluate the variation in energy expenditure after the consumption of the fortified&#xD;
           breads.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Specific Aim 1: Determine the acceptability and assess sensory differences of the fortified&#xD;
      breads.&#xD;
&#xD;
      White wheat flour will be fortified with either lysine, phosphorus, or both lysine and&#xD;
      phosphorus. The acceptability of these fortified breads will be tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      L- Lysine monohydrochloride will be used as the sources of lysine. Potassium phosphate will&#xD;
      be used as the source of phosphorus. From previous experience, the addition of potassium&#xD;
      phosphate to glucose solution was found to minimally affect the organoleptic properties.&#xD;
      Unlike that of sodium phosphate that was not well tolerated by subjects due to development of&#xD;
      unfavorable flavor (fishy flavor).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Locally produced white wheat flour (80% extraction) will be purchased and stored at the&#xD;
      department. White flour samples will be analyzed for their content of phosphorus according to&#xD;
      standard procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fortification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fortification with lysine: 625mg of L-lysine monohydrochloride will be added to 100g of wheat&#xD;
      flour, giving a fortification rate of 500mg of lysine (0.5%) in 100g of wheat flour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fortification with phosphorus: Phosphorus will be added to white wheat flour in the&#xD;
      proportion of 500mg of phosphorus in 100g of white wheat flour, and this will add up to a&#xD;
      total of 608mg of phosphorus in 100g of fortified white wheat flour (with 108mg of phosphorus&#xD;
      initially present in 100g of unfortified white wheat flour).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Making of breads:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four different types of bread will be made:&#xD;
&#xD;
      White bread unfortified (WB) White bread fortified with lysine (WB-L) White bread fortified&#xD;
      with phosphorus (WB-P) White bread fortified with lysine and phosphorus (WB-LP)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acceptability of the four different breads:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bread samples will be tested for acceptability. Panelists (n= 60) will be recruited based on&#xD;
      their willingness to participate in the study and their consumption of Arabic bread.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Panelists will be asked to fill a questionnaire and to rate the served samples on a 9-point&#xD;
      hedonic scale with 1 representing dislike extremely and 9 representing like extremely for&#xD;
      overall acceptability, acceptability of appearance, texture and taste. The order of&#xD;
      presentation of the samples will be counterbalanced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensory evaluation of the four different breads:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Panelists (n=24) who are regular consumers of white bread will be recruited to assess any&#xD;
      sensory differences between experimental samples of the white bread control and the three&#xD;
      white breads supplemented with lysine and/or phosphorus. The triangle test will be used in&#xD;
      the difference tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be asked to sign human subjects consent forms and answer demographic&#xD;
      information. Demographic information that will be requested will be: 1) age, 2) gender, 3)&#xD;
      frequency of bread consumption, 4) type of bread typically consumed, and 5) what factors&#xD;
      influence the panelists' bread purchase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty four panelists will participate in three triangle test, comparing the white bread&#xD;
      control vs. each of the three experimental samples in each test. In the session, subjects&#xD;
      will be debriefed about a) the products they will consume, b) the procedures for the testing,&#xD;
      c) instructions on how to sample the beverages, and d) how to use the score card. All samples&#xD;
      will be presented in a random, balanced order.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mineral and carbohydrate content of bread:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phosphorus content of the breads will be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: Determine the glycemic response following the consumption of the different&#xD;
      fortified breads.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this experiment, healthy subjects (n=12) will be recruited and asked to maintain their&#xD;
      regular dietary and physical activity habits during the entire study course, avoid alcohol&#xD;
      consumption as well as any unusual strenuous exercise 24 hours prior to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: any significant medical diseases; pregnancy or lactation; regular use of&#xD;
      medication that affects body weight; a weight loss of 3% or more in the preceding 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following a 12 hour (overnight) fast, subjects will be taken to the testing facility [Faculty&#xD;
      of Agriculture and Food Sciences/Department of Nutrition or the Central research unit (CRU)/&#xD;
      American University Hospital] where anthropometric measurements (height, weight) will be&#xD;
      taken. A catheter will be inserted for blood withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postprandial glycemic response after consumption of the four fortified breads will be&#xD;
      determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A crossover design will be used in which each subject will undertake 4 visits in a random&#xD;
      order over 4 different days, the difference between the visits being the type of bread to be&#xD;
      consumed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In brief, overnight fasted subjects will be given the bread (50 g of carbohydrate) to ingest&#xD;
      within 10-15 min and drink 250 ml of water. Blood samples will be taken immediately before&#xD;
      the meal and at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 minutes after meal ingestion. Blood will be&#xD;
      withdrawn by a trained practitioner and will be used for the determination of glucose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glucose area under the curve (AUC) will be calculated. In addition, mineral and several&#xD;
      metabolites content of the blood will be measured (glucose, total phosphorus, triglycerides,&#xD;
      insulin and GLP-1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: Evaluate the variation in Energy Expenditure after the consumption of the&#xD;
      fortified breads.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject recruitment: 16 healthy subjects in total will be recruited. 14 subjects will be&#xD;
      required in order to be able to detect significance at the level of 0.05, using a 25%&#xD;
      difference between treatments and 90% power. But, a total number of 16 subjects will be&#xD;
      recruited in order to allow for the loss which might take place due to the dropping out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: 16 subjects (BMI between 20 and 25) will be recruited. Efforts will be&#xD;
      made to age and gender match subjects (balanced number of males and females in each group).&#xD;
      Subjects are appropriate if they are in the age range between 18 and 60. Women who are in the&#xD;
      reproductive age will be studied at the first half of their menstrual cycle, because estrogen&#xD;
      is known to affect the energy expenditure. Postmenopausal women taking hormonal replacement&#xD;
      therapy will be excluded. Subjects should have: Cr &lt;1mg/dl for women and &lt;1.2mg/dl for men&#xD;
      and GFR &gt;60 ml/min/1.73m2.&#xD;
