      An open label, pilot study involving the use of low dose oral minoxidil to treat permanent&#xD;
      chemotherapy-induced alopecia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be evaluated through clinical assessment, histology, quality of life&#xD;
      assessment, and adverse event monitoring. The data gathered from this study will be used to&#xD;
      determine the safety and efficacy of the treatment regimen for this subset of CIA patients.&#xD;
      The oral minoxidil regimen will be considered effective if significant clinical regrowth,&#xD;
      positive histological changes, and improved Quality of Life are reported after the onset of&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
