  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is one of the complications associated with surgery&#xD;
      and anaesthesia. The main aim of the study is to determine the incidence of post-operative&#xD;
      nausea and vomiting among surgical patients undergoing regional anaesthesia and the factors&#xD;
      associated with it. Patients above the age of 18 who have consented and are undergoing&#xD;
      surgery under regional anaesthesia will be enrolled into the study over 6months. They will&#xD;
      then be observed for up to 24 hours post operatively to determine the incidence of PONV and&#xD;
      factors associated with it.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is one of the complications associated with surgery&#xD;
      and anaesthesia. Due to advanced techniques in the field of anaesthesia and surgery, patients&#xD;
      are commonly operated on under regional anaesthesia (RA) rather than general anaesthesia&#xD;
      (GA). Post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV) still occurs with regional anaesthesia, but&#xD;
      the incidence and associated factors in our setting remain unknown. An optimal management of&#xD;
      PONV is important because they can lead to increased morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aim of the study is to determine the incidence of post-operative nausea and vomiting&#xD;
      among surgical patients undergoing regional anaesthesia and the factors associated with it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a prospective cohort study. Patients aged 18 years and above in whom surgery&#xD;
      under regional anaesthesia is planned at Mulago hospital will be consented and enrolled into&#xD;
      the study over 6months. Data will be collected using semi structured and pre-tested&#xD;
      questionnaires. Patients will be observed for up to 24 hours post operatively to determine&#xD;
      the incidence of and factors associated with PONV in regional anaesthesia at Mulago hospital.&#xD;
      After recruitment, patients will be followed up once at 24 hours post-operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results from this study will determine the incidence of post-operative nausea and vomiting in&#xD;
      surgical patients undergoing regional anaesthesia and the associated factors, data which we&#xD;
      do not have in our setting. This will help to guide practice on the prevention and management&#xD;
      of post-operative nausea and vomiting.&#xD;
