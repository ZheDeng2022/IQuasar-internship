  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the last few decades, the world has seen a significant increase in the occurrence of&#xD;
      occupational diseases related to Burnout Syndrome (professional exhaustion) and stress in&#xD;
      educators. These disorders affect mental health and teaching activity. In this way, they need&#xD;
      to develop socio-emotional skills to cope with the psychosocial stressors related to the&#xD;
      school environment. Currently, mindfulness-based therapies have been recommended to help&#xD;
      educators acquire emotional self-control, and to improve self-esteem, metacognition,&#xD;
      attention, resilience and affectivity, in addition to better the social skills needed in the&#xD;
      school milieu. The main objective of the proposed research project is to elaborate a program&#xD;
      of Mindfulness-Based Health Promotion - educators (MBHP - educa) to be applied to a&#xD;
      population of Brazilian public school educators. The efficacy of the program will be&#xD;
      evaluated by cognitive testing. Blood tests for the above-mentioned stress-related molecules&#xD;
      will be performed. The goal of developing the MBHP - educa Program is to promote and&#xD;
      ameliorate the health care of public school teachers. Developing such a research proposal&#xD;
      will contribute to debate and implement public health policies focussed on promoting the&#xD;
      health of public school teachers in Brazil.&#xD;

      In the last few decades, the world has seen a significant increase in the occurrence of&#xD;
      occupational diseases related to Burnout Syndrome (professional exhaustion) and stress in&#xD;
      educators. These disorders affect mental health and teaching activity. In this way, they need&#xD;
      to develop socio-emotional skills to cope with the psychosocial stressors related to the&#xD;
      school environment. Currently, mindfulness-based therapies have been recommended to help&#xD;
      educators acquire emotional self-control, and to improve self-esteem, metacognition,&#xD;
      attention, resilience and affectivity, in addition to better the social skills needed in the&#xD;
      school milieu. A few published studies indicate that mindfulness practices also reduce some&#xD;
      inflammation- and stress- related molecules such as cortisol, receptor-interacting&#xD;
      serine/threonine kinase 2 (RIPK2), cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2), interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor&#xD;
      necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and epigenetic-regulation related histone deacetilases (HDAC).&#xD;
      These indicator molecules can be measured in blood. The World Health Organisation (WHO-2013)&#xD;
      recommends the worldwide implementation of strategies for the promotion of mental health,&#xD;
      which are particularly aimed at preventing occupational diseases. The main objective of the&#xD;
      proposed research project is to elaborate a program of Mindfulness-Based Health Promotion -&#xD;
      educators (MBHP - educa) to be applied to a population of Brazilian public school educators.&#xD;
      The efficacy of the program will be evaluated by cognitive testing. Blood tests for the&#xD;
