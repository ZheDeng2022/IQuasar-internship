  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Population mobility is common in South Africa, but important research gaps exist describing&#xD;
      this mobility and its impact on engagement in HIV care, particularly among pregnant and&#xD;
      postpartum women. Through this study, the investigators propose to test a smartphone&#xD;
      application - CareConekta - to conduct essential formative work on mobility and evaluate this&#xD;
      app as an intervention to facilitate engagement in HIV care during times of mobility. This&#xD;
      work is critical to adapting CareConekta for widespread use, providing critical information&#xD;
      about mobility during the peripartum period and the impact on engagement in HIV care, and&#xD;
      piloting this intervention to improve engagement.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      South Africa is home to the world's largest antiretroviral therapy (ART) program, but&#xD;
      sustaining high retention along the HIV care continuum has proven challenging in the country&#xD;
      and throughout the wider region. Population mobility is common in South Africa, but important&#xD;
      research gaps exist describing this mobility and its impact on engagement in HIV care.&#xD;
      Postpartum women and their infants in South Africa are known to be at high risk of dropping&#xD;
      out of HIV care after delivery and are frequently mobile. The investigators recently&#xD;
      developed a beta version of a smartphone application (app) - CareConekta - that detects a&#xD;
      user's smartphone location to allow for prospective characterization of mobility. Through&#xD;
      this three-year study, the investigators propose to test CareConekta to conduct essential&#xD;
      formative work on mobility and evaluate an intervention - the CareConekta app plus text&#xD;
      notifications and optional staff phone calls and/or WhatsApp messages - to facilitate&#xD;
      engagement in HIV care during times of mobility. After first adapting CareConekta to use&#xD;
      appropriate smartphone technology for the local population, the investigators will&#xD;
      characterize mobility among South African women during the peripartum period and its impact&#xD;
      on engagement in HIV care. The investigators also will evaluate the acceptability,&#xD;
      feasibility, and initial efficacy of using CareConekta as an intervention to improve&#xD;
      engagement in HIV care. The investigators will work with a South African technology company&#xD;
      with a strong connection to the South African Department of Health to adapt the app prior to&#xD;
      enrolling study participants. The study will observe mobility within an observational cohort&#xD;
      and will then assess the impact of the intervention among participants who travel during the&#xD;
      study period. This work is critical to adapting an existing app for widespread use, providing&#xD;
      critical information about mobility during the peripartum period and the impact on engagement&#xD;
      in HIV care, and piloting an intervention to improve engagement. This study will lay the&#xD;
      necessary groundwork for a larger efficacy trial of the intervention within different&#xD;
      geographic settings.&#xD;
