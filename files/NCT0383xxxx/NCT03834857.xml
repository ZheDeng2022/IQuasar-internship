      STENTRODE WITH THOUGHT CONTROLLED DIGITAL SWITCH: An early feasibility study (EFS) of the&#xD;
      safety of the StentrodeTM device in participants with loss of motor function due to paralysis&#xD;
      from spinal cord injury, motor neuron disease, stroke, muscular dystrophy or loss of limbs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research has shown that in individuals with neurological conditions, brain signals can be&#xD;
      recorded using electrical sensors implanted on to the brain. These signals could be used by&#xD;
      the individuals to control assistive technology (e.g. spelling devices) that help with daily&#xD;
      life, just by thinking. However, implanting these electrical sensors often requires open&#xD;
      brain surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new medical device and surgical technique has been developed, which allows implantation of&#xD;
      the electrical sensors without open brain surgery. The device, called Stentrode™, is a small&#xD;
      metallic mesh tube (stent), with electrode contacts (small metal disks) within the stent&#xD;
      structure. It can be placed inside a blood vessel of the brain located in the motor cortex.&#xD;
      This does not involve open brain surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this research is to evaluate the safety of the Stentrode™ device in humans.&#xD;
      This is an experimental device. This research will be the first of its kind to be performed&#xD;
      in humans and may help find safer, more effective ways to introduce/implant electrical&#xD;
      sensors in patients. This could foster the development of user friendly biotechnology for&#xD;
      patients with neurological conditions.&#xD;

             time to study site)&#xD;
