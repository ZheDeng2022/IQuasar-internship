    <textblock>
      Background: Current guidelines recommend that every person with Parkinson's disease (PD)&#xD;
      should have access to Parkinson's Disease Nurse Specialist (PDNS) care. Thus, hospitals&#xD;
      increasingly offer PDNS care to their patients with PD. However, there is currently little&#xD;
      scientific evidence on the cost-effectiveness of PDNS care. Consequently, many hospitals lack&#xD;
      the nursing capacity to offer PDNS care to all patients, which creates unequal access to care&#xD;
      and possibly avoidable disability and costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The investigators aim to study the (cost-)effectiveness of specialized nursing&#xD;
      care provided by a PDNS as compared to no PDNS care for people with PD in all disease stages.&#xD;
      To gain more insight into the used interventions and their effects, a subgroup analysis will&#xD;
      be performed based on disease duration (diagnosis made &lt;5, 5-10, or &gt;10 years ago).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The investigators will perform an 18-month, single-blind, randomized controlled&#xD;
      clinical trial in eight community hospitals in the Netherlands. A total of 240 people with&#xD;
      idiopathic PD that have not been treated by a PDNS over the past two years will be included,&#xD;
      independent of disease severity or duration. In each hospital, 30 patients will randomly be&#xD;
      allocated in a 1:1 ratio to either PDNS care according to the Dutch Guideline on PDNS care or&#xD;
      no nursing intervention (continuing usual care). For the allocation of participants, a&#xD;
      computer-generated list of random numbers will be used. The co-primary outcome measures are&#xD;
      Quality of Life (QoL) and motor symptoms. Secondary outcomes include PD symptoms, mobility,&#xD;
      non-motor symptoms, health-related quality of life, experienced quality of care,&#xD;
      self-management, medication adherence, caregiver quality of life, coping skills and caregiver&#xD;
      burden. Data will be collected after 12 months and 18 months. A healthcare utilization and&#xD;
      productivity loss questionnaire will be completed every 3 months by both the patient and the&#xD;
      caregiver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that, by offering more patients access to PDNS&#xD;
      care, QoL will increase with equal healthcare costs. Increasing direct medical costs (for&#xD;
      nurse staffing) will be offset by a reduced number of consultations with the general&#xD;
      practitioner and neurologist. If these outcomes are reached, wide implementation of PDNS care&#xD;
      is needed.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      1. Background The Parkinson's Disease Nurse Specialist (PDNS) can fulfill a pivotal role in&#xD;
           the multidisciplinary team of people with PD. The PDNS was introduced in 1989 in the&#xD;
           United Kingdom to bridge the gap between medical management and the unique personal&#xD;
           needs of patients. To obtain greater uniformity in care delivery by a PDNS and to&#xD;
           facilitate the efficacy of nursing care in PD, the Dutch Guideline 'Nursing care in&#xD;
           Parkinson's disease' was published in 2016. The main roles of the PDNS are clearly&#xD;
           described in the Guideline, and include 1) providing information, education and&#xD;
           instruction; 2) supporting the patient and caregiver in the promotion of&#xD;
           self-management; 3) supporting psychosocial care questions; 4) prevention; 5)&#xD;
           specialized diagnostic strategies and therapeutic nursing interventions; and 6)&#xD;
           multidisciplinary collaboration.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Based on expert opinion from healthcare professionals, the Dutch guideline advises that&#xD;
           every person with PD could benefit from PDNS care, including those in early-stage&#xD;
           disease where delivery of information, education about medication compliance and support&#xD;
           in self-management are critical. So far, only three studies have evaluated PDNS care and&#xD;
           they have found inconsistent results. Overall, they indicate that PDNS care may improve&#xD;
           patient wellbeing, physical functioning and general health status and reduce anxiety and&#xD;
           depression, but definite conclusions could not be drawn. Moreover, there is little&#xD;
           evidence that shows that quality of life actually improves with PDNS care and to date,&#xD;
           no studies have been performed that evaluated the cost-effectiveness of PDNS care.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Currently, most hospitals in The Netherlands offer PDNS care, since it is advised in the&#xD;
           Dutch Multidisciplinary Guideline. However many centers still lack the nursing capacity&#xD;
           to offer PDNS care to all patients because the scientific evidence is inconclusive. This&#xD;
           situation creates an undesirable inequality in access to care and presumably leads to&#xD;
           avoidable disability and costs (e.g. from early admissions to nursing homes or crisis&#xD;
           admissions to the hospital). Therefore, the investigators aim to study the&#xD;
           cost-effectiveness of specialized nursing care provided by a PDNS as compared to no PDNS&#xD;
           care for people with PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study design The NICE-PD study is an 18-month, single-blind randomized controlled&#xD;
           clinical trial that will be performed in eight community hospitals in the Netherlands. A&#xD;
           total of 240 people with PD will be included (120 in each group) and equally distributed&#xD;
           over the participating hospitals. The investigators have selected hospitals where, due&#xD;
           to lack of sufficient PDNS staff, only a proportion of PD patients currently has access&#xD;
           to PDNS care. This provides the investigators with a unique opportunity to identify&#xD;
           patients who at present have no access to PDNS care, and to randomize them within&#xD;
           hospitals (at the patient level) between PDNS care and no nursing intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Eligible patients will be allocated randomly to either PDNS care or usual care in a 1:1&#xD;
           ratio, using a computer-generated list of random numbers. To ascertain an equal&#xD;
           representation of patients, the investigators will stratify for disease duration&#xD;
           (according to pre-defined subgroups, i.e. disease duration &lt;5 years, 5-10 years and &gt;10&#xD;
           years). The PDNS intervention will be carried out according to the Dutch 'Guideline&#xD;
           Nursing care in PD'. A blinded researcher will perform the clinical assessments at&#xD;
           baseline (t0), after 12 months (t1) and after 18 months (t2). Patients and caregivers&#xD;
           will also be asked to complete a set of questionnaires at t0, t1 and t2. Finally, every&#xD;
           three months patients and their caregivers will complete an online questionnaire about&#xD;
           healthcare utilization, costs and productivity loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
           The PDNS intervention will be performed according to the Dutch 'Guideline Nursing care&#xD;
           in PD' published in 2015. The intervention is not standardized, but tailored to the&#xD;
           patients' and caregivers' needs. This includes the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Assessment of individual care needs of people with PD and their caregivers. The&#xD;
                PDNS performs a specific nursing assessment related to the medical, physical,&#xD;
                psychological and social domains.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Development of a patient-centered treatment plan that supports the patient and&#xD;
                caregiver in self-management. The PDNS composes a multidisciplinary plan, based on&#xD;
                the results of the individual assessment, and as prioritized by the patient and&#xD;
                caregiver (shared decision making). The treatment plan is developed according to&#xD;
                the national self-management framework.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Specific nursing interventions. The intervention varies across disease stages and&#xD;
                is tailored to the specific problems and needs of individual patients and their&#xD;
                caregivers. The Guideline on PDNS care describes general- and specific nursing&#xD;
                interventions. General interventions consist of providing information and&#xD;
                education, disease management (e.g. considering advanced treatment options such as&#xD;
                DBS) and monitoring (e.g. of caregiver burden). Specific nursing interventions are&#xD;
                described for the following areas: mental functions, fatigue, sleep, urogenital&#xD;
                functions, sexuality, medication adherence, orthostatic hypotension, caregiver&#xD;
                burden, coping, mobility, self-management and dietary issues (table 2 provides&#xD;
                examples of such interventions).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Collaboration with other healthcare professionals. The PDNS stimulates and supports&#xD;
                multidisciplinary collaboration between healthcare professionals based on the&#xD;
                individual patient-centered treatment plan. The PDNS also plays a pivotal role in&#xD;
                the timely referral to other healthcare professionals.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The PDNS will keep a pre-defined electronic study report according to a structured&#xD;
           format for each PD patient, documenting the individual care needs, present symptoms,&#xD;
           performed interventions and (changes in) the individual care plan. This report will be&#xD;
           started at the initial assessment and updated at every follow-up contact with the&#xD;
           patient, e.g. at the outpatient clinic, during a telephone consultation or at a home&#xD;
           visit. This data will be purposefully collected for a possible process analysis at the&#xD;
           end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients will have regular contact with their PDNS about the progress and realization of&#xD;
           the personal goals, both during face-to-face contacts and by telephone, and sometimes&#xD;
           during additional home visits. The frequency and type of contact will be optimized for&#xD;
           each patient depending on disease stage and individual patient needs. The Guideline on&#xD;
           PDNS care advises that each patient has a minimum of one contact with the PDNS each&#xD;
           year. Currently in the Netherlands, patients are seen on average twice a year by their&#xD;
           PDNS, with an additional two interim telephone consultations per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The control group will receive ongoing/ usual care which is otherwise comparable, but&#xD;
           without a nursing intervention. This involves regular consultations with a neurologist&#xD;
           in their own community hospital (typically 2-4 times per year, depending on patient&#xD;
           preferences and health status). In addition, control patients will have no other&#xD;
           restrictions considering any other medical treatments (e.g. by a psychologist or social&#xD;
           worker). Importantly, many important elements of care (including in particular the&#xD;
           treating neurologist) remain comparable between the two intervention arms because of the&#xD;
           randomization at patient level within hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Clinical assessments At baseline, t1 and t2 all patients will visit their own hospital&#xD;
           for the study assessments which are performed by a blinded researcher (PDQ-39,&#xD;
           MDS-UPDRS, and TUG). Furthermore, the patients and their caregivers will complete&#xD;
           additional home questionnaires. In addition, every three months, patients will receive a&#xD;
           questionnaire at home regarding healthcare utilization, costs and productivity loss over&#xD;
           the past three months. Caregivers will complete a cost questionnaire including&#xD;
           healthcare utilization, costs and productivity loss specifically related to caregiver&#xD;
           burden. Patients can choose if they want to fill out digital or paper questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Data analysis The economic evaluation investigates, alongside the clinical trial, the&#xD;
           value for money of full implementation of the PDNS into PD care from a societal and&#xD;
           healthcare perspective. The investigators will take all relevant costs into account. The&#xD;
           cost-effectiveness timeframe adheres to the clinical study protocol and evaluates&#xD;
           cost-effectiveness up to 18 months after randomization. Cost will be measured using a&#xD;
           healthcare utilization questionnaire (e.g. including medical consultations, hospital&#xD;
           admissions, medication, travel costs, etc.) and a questionnaire measuring productivity&#xD;
           loss while working of both patients and caregivers. Per item of healthcare consumption,&#xD;
           standard cost-prices will be determined using the guideline for performing economic&#xD;
           evaluations. If standardized prices are not available, full cost prices will be&#xD;
           determined using activity based costing. Costs will be analyzed using a mixed model&#xD;
           approach or a general linear model approach with a gamma distribution using a log link&#xD;
           to account for possible skewness of the cost data.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The investigators will use a PD-specific quality of life measure (PDQ-39) and a generic&#xD;
           health-related quality of life scale (EQ5D) to evaluate the quality of the health status&#xD;
           of patients. The potential difference in Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) measured&#xD;
           with the EQ5D will be analyzed with a regression approach. The investigators will use a&#xD;
           linear mixed model with repeated measurements to test for differences in quality of life&#xD;
           (measured with the PDQ-39) between both groups. The same analysis will be used to&#xD;
           measure differences between groups in the secondary outcome measures. The investigators&#xD;
           will include study center as a random effect and fixed effects for group, time and the&#xD;
           interaction between group and time. Each of the outcomes will be included as dependent&#xD;
           variable. Statistical analyses will be performed based on the intention-to-treat&#xD;
           principle.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Besides the overall cost-effectiveness evaluation, the investigators will perform a&#xD;
           pre-planned subgroup analysis based on disease duration (diagnosis made &lt;5 years, 5-10&#xD;
           years or &gt;10 years ago) to obtain more insight into the nursing interventions used in&#xD;
           each disease stage and the effects of PDNS care in these different groups of patients.&#xD;
           This subgroup analysis will be performed because, for example, for the more severely&#xD;
           affected patients the nursing intervention is expected to become more intensive and&#xD;
           possibly more effective, but also more expensive. When different patterns of this kind&#xD;
           are found, this should be investigated further in future trials that are powered&#xD;
           adequately to address such group differences.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Discussion The investigators hypothesize that offering PDNS care will lead to higher&#xD;
           quality of life with equal healthcare costs. Increasing direct medical costs (for nurse&#xD;
           staffing) are expected to be offset by a reduced number of (telephone) consultations&#xD;
           with the general practitioner and neurologist. These short-term goals are the focus of&#xD;
           the present NICE-PD proposal. In addition to the short-term effects, the investigators&#xD;
           also expect long-term benefits, which are out of scope of the present project. Examples&#xD;
           of potential long-term benefits include a reduction in the number of nursing home&#xD;
           admissions and fewer emergency visits to the hospital, which would lead to a substantial&#xD;
           cost reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conclusion, this study will generate new insights into the cost-effectiveness of&#xD;
      specialized PD nursing interventions for people with PD. If positive results are found, a&#xD;
      large shift in the organization of PD care is needed to warrant equal access to PDNS care for&#xD;
      every person with PD.&#xD;
