      This phase 1 study is a non-randomized, single-arm, multi-center study that is designed to&#xD;
      evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the flash glucose monitoring system together&#xD;
      with a structured education programme in individuals with Type 2 Diabetes.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 30 adults and 15 children will be recruited from 3 different sites in Singapore.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Adults, this phase consists of screening and intervention periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Period (Week -2 to -1):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to wear a blinded flash glucose monitoring system and will be&#xD;
      asked to continue testing their capillary glucose readings at least once daily for 2 weeks&#xD;
      (week -2 to week -1). Sensor glucose measurements are not available to both participants and&#xD;
      investigators during this screening period. Participants who are able to wear the sensor for&#xD;
      the 2 weeks, and are monitoring their capillary glucose levels at least 70% of the time for&#xD;
      the 2 weeks (&gt;10 readings/2weeks), will proceed on with the intervention period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Period (Week 0 - 26):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will wear a personal version of the flash glucose monitoring system continuously&#xD;
      for the next 6 weeks. After these 6 weeks, they will wear the sensor intermittently (one&#xD;
      sensor lasting 2 weeks, per 4 weeks) for the following 18 weeks.Participants in this arm will&#xD;
      receive an education package that consists of Diabetes nurse educator and/or dietitian&#xD;
      appointments during weeks 0, 2, 6 and 24. After week 24, they will put on a blinded sensor&#xD;
      for the last 2 weeks of the intervention period (week 25 to week 26). HbA1c will be monitored&#xD;
      at weeks 0, 14 and 24. Questionnaires will be administered to assess acceptability of wear,&#xD;
      and perceived value to the end-user.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paediatric participants will not undergo blinded sensor wear but will undergo the&#xD;
      intervention period, with the schedule of wear identical to the adults'. The education&#xD;
      curriculum will be age-appropriate and will be delivered over weeks 0, 2, 6, 12, and 24.&#xD;
      Their HbA1c will be monitored at week 0, 12 and 24. Questionnaires will be administered to&#xD;
      assess acceptability of wear, and perceived value to the end-user.&#xD;
