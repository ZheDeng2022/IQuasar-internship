      This phase Ib/II trial studies the best dose of temozolomide and how well it works with&#xD;
      niraparib and atezolizumab in treating patients with solid tumors that have spread to other&#xD;
      places in the body (advanced) and extensive-stage small cell lung cancer with a complete or&#xD;
      partial response to platinum-based first-line chemotherapy. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such&#xD;
      as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing&#xD;
      the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Niraparib is&#xD;
      an inhibitor of PARP, an enzyme that helps repair deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) when it becomes&#xD;
      damaged. Blocking PARP may help keep cancer cells from repairing their damaged DNA, causing&#xD;
      them to die. PARP inhibitors are a type of targeted therapy. Immunotherapy with monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and&#xD;
      may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving temozolomide,&#xD;
      niraparib and atezolizumab may work better in treating patients with advanced solid tumors&#xD;
      and extensive-stage small cell lung cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of temozolomide in combination with&#xD;
      niraparib and atezolizumab. (Phase Ib) II. Evaluate the efficacy of niraparib plus&#xD;
      temozolomide plus atezolizumab at RP2D (Arm A) compared with atezolizumab (Arm B) as measured&#xD;
      by progression-free survival (PFS). (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the efficacy of niraparib plus temozolomide plus atezolizumab compared with&#xD;
      atezolizumab alone, as measured by overall survival (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the efficacy of niraparib plus temozolomide plus atezolizumab compared with&#xD;
      atezolizumab alone, as measured by objective response rate (ORR) as measured by Response&#xD;
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the safety of niraparib plus temozolomide plus atezolizumab compared with&#xD;
      atezolizumab alone as measured by adverse events (AEs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess participant-reported outcomes on health-related quality of life and adverse&#xD;
      events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of temozolomide. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2&#xD;
      arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A: Patients receive temozolomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-5 and niraparib PO&#xD;
      QD on days 1-28. Cycles repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive standard of care atezolizumab intravenously (IV)&#xD;
      every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B: Patients receive standard of care atezolizumab IV every 3 weeks in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 8 weeks for&#xD;
      24 weeks, and then every 12 weeks for up to 1 year.&#xD;
