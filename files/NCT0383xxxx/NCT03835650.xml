  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain (PGP) can appear during pregnancy, directly&#xD;
      after labour or can be delayed to 3 weeks postpartum. Pain is experienced between the&#xD;
      posterior iliac crest and the gluteal fold, particularly in the vicinity of the Sacroiliac&#xD;
      joints (SIJ). The pain may radiate in the posterior thigh and can also occur in conjunction&#xD;
      with/or separately in the symphysis. The endurance capacity for standing, walking, and&#xD;
      sitting is diminished. The diagnosis of PGP can be reached after exclusion of lumbar causes.&#xD;
      The pain or functional disturbances in relation to PGP must be reproducible by specific&#xD;
      clinical tests. Lack of accurate and early diagnosis of the PGP reasons postpartum may&#xD;
      contribute to development of chronic condition, lowering quality of life years after&#xD;
      delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The aim of the project is to evaluate the underlying cause of the severe pelvic&#xD;
      girdle pain postpartum (whether it is real PGP or diastasis pubic symphysis) and to assess&#xD;
      the differences between females with severe postpartum PGP, mild and moderate PGP and with no&#xD;
      PGP in terms of: presence of diastasis pubic symphysis, presence of diastasis recti and linea&#xD;
      alba dysfunction, factors associated with labour and maladaptive mental processing&#xD;
      (catastrophizing).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods: Because of low incidence of researched conditions, a case control&#xD;
      study will be the study design of choice. The subjects with PGP will be matched with those&#xD;
      with no PGP. Subjects' assessment will consist of palpation and ultrasonography evaluation of&#xD;
      diastasis recti(inter-recti distance), ultrasonography assesment of pubic symphysis&#xD;
      (inter-pubic width) and mental processing (catastrophizing assessed with Pain Catastrophizing&#xD;
      Scale) analysis. Factors connected with labour (time from epidural anaesthesia injection to&#xD;
      full dilatation and delivery) will be also investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results: To the investigators' knowledge, postpartum pelvic girdle pain has not been&#xD;
      extensively studied so far. The study will bring information about the possible underlying&#xD;
      cause of postpartum PGP: whether it is PGP or diastasis pubic symphysis.&#xD;
