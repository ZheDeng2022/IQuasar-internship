  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to determine the highest dose of ON 01910.Na that can be&#xD;
      safely given as an intravenous infusion over 24 hours once a week in a 3-week cycle to&#xD;
      patients with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;

      This is an open-label, dose-escalating Phase I study of ON 01910.Na in patients with advanced&#xD;
      cancers, who have satisfied the inclusion/exclusion criteria enumerated in this protocol.&#xD;
      Patients will receive ON 01910.Na intravenously by 24 hour continuous infusion once every&#xD;
      week (3 weeks per cycle), until evidence of disease progression, intolerable adverse events,&#xD;
      or withdrawal of patient consent. Safety monitoring will be done for at least 3 weeks before&#xD;
      escalation to the next dose level. As of Amendment 7, up to 6 patients with gynecological&#xD;
      malignancies will be enrolled at the 2400 mg/m2 dose level to determine the appropriateness&#xD;
      of this dose as the Recommended Phase Two Dose (RPTD).&#xD;

          -  Must have histologically confirmed solid tumor (leukemias and lymphomas excluded)&#xD;
             malignancy that is incurable and for which standard (FDA approved or established&#xD;
             standard clinical practice), curative, or palliative measures do not exist or are no&#xD;
             longer effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with disease amenable to sequential biopsies will be requested to undergo two&#xD;
