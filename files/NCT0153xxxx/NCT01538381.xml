  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The general objectives are to evaluate the pre-operative activity and the safety of afatinib&#xD;
      in head and neck cancer and to explore the different downstream molecular pathways to&#xD;
      identify tumor response and resistance mechanisms. The results from this study can be used to&#xD;
      conduct a larger trial that would allow us to confirm or validate the hypotheses generated.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, multicenter early phase II trial exploring the pre-operative activity&#xD;
      of afatinib vs. nontreatment. The study includes an early monitoring of the surgical&#xD;
      co-morbidities for patients treated with afatinib and accrual may be stopped prematurely&#xD;
      according to a pre-defined safety stopping rule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized with a 5:1 ratio, between the two arms: afatinib and 'no&#xD;
      treatment'. It is intended to include a total of 30 eligible patients out of which 25&#xD;
      patients will be randomized into the afatinib arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients allocated to the 'no treatment' arm will mainly serve as a reference to interpret&#xD;
      the results of the translational research part of the study although no formal comparison&#xD;
      between the afatinib arm and the 'no treatment' arm is intended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be first registered into the EORTC system after signing the informed consent&#xD;
      form. The site will have to complete all the study related procedures within 4 weeks prior&#xD;
      randomization and all eligibility criteria should be met before the patient can be randomized&#xD;
      into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The registration of patients will proceed with slots for patients which will be opened or&#xD;
      closed based on the randomization of patients into the afatinib arm. Starting with 3 free&#xD;
      slots, an additional slot will become available for each patient randomized to the 'no&#xD;
      treatment' arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Registration will be paused after three completes the 4 week observation period after&#xD;
      surgery. Similar action will be done after the next 3 patients have been entered into the&#xD;
      afatinib arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the first 6 patients in the afatinib arm have been observed for surgical toxicities of&#xD;
      grade ≥ 3 for 4 weeks following surgery, the slot system will cease to operate.&#xD;

             contraception to avoid pregnancy throughout the study and 6 months beyond stop of&#xD;
             treatment in such a manner that the risk of pregnancy is minimized. In general, the&#xD;
             decision for appropriate methods to prevent pregnancy should be determined by&#xD;
             discussions between the investigator and the study subject. WOCBP include any female&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Women of child bearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy&#xD;
                  test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 72 hours&#xD;
