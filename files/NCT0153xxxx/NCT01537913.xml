      Hypothesis: FOUR score is a better predictor of outcome (in hospital mortality and functional&#xD;
      outcome at discharge) than GCS in children 5- 18 years age admitted in pediatric ward/ ICU&#xD;
      with non-traumatic impaired consciousness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessment of comatose patients is an important part of critical care. The assessment of&#xD;
      the level of coma relies on clinical scores. The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS),remains the most&#xD;
      commonly used scoring system for altered state of consciousness. Despite its widespread use,&#xD;
      a number of limitations have been identified with GCS like inability to assess verbal score&#xD;
      in intubated patients and non-inclusion of vital brainstem functions. The FOUR (Full Outline&#xD;
      of UnResponsiveness) score, a coma scale consisting of four components (eye response, motor&#xD;
      response, brainstem reflexes, and respiration pattern) was recently proposed by investigators&#xD;
      from the Mayo Clinic.keeping in view the limitations of GCS, this study was planned to&#xD;
      compare the new FOUR score with GCS as a predictor of mortality and poor functional outcome&#xD;
      at hospital discharge.&#xD;

      This prospective observational study was carried out from May 2009 to June 2010 in the&#xD;
      Department of Pediatrics, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi. This study was&#xD;
      approved by institutional ethics committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants We enrolled children aged 5-18 years who presented with impaired consciousness&#xD;
      of less than 7 days duration and were admitted in the pediatric ward or pediatric ICU.&#xD;
      Children with traumatic brain injury, known vision/hearing impairment, cerebral palsy, mental&#xD;
      retardation, degenerative brain disease; those already on sedatives or neuromuscular blockade&#xD;
      and with ongoing seizure or seizure within last 1 hour were excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size From the previous studies, it is known that ROC of GCS in children for prediction&#xD;
      of mortality is 0.7.15 Assuming FOUR score to be better predictor of outcome (area under&#xD;
      curve for FOUR score assumed to be 0.8), the sample size calculation was done using MedcalcR&#xD;
      version 9.2.0.1. The correlation between both the scores and outcome was assumed to be 0.7.&#xD;
      Keeping α-level as 0.05 and β-level as 0.20, the sample size was calculated to be 70.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment Procedure The investigator (GK) was trained with the standardized video examples&#xD;
      included in a DVD prepared by the developers of the FOUR score (Wijdicks et al10). After&#xD;
      training, the investigator demonstrated the score on 2 patients while being supervised by&#xD;
      Pediatric Neurologist. There was periodic training of the investigator every month by&#xD;
      reviewing the case examples in DVD and rechecking the score periodically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written informed consent was obtained from the parents/ guardians for all patients. All the&#xD;
      observations (required for the FOUR score and GCS) and investigations (required for PIM2) are&#xD;
      done routinely in the children admitted in Pediatric ward/PICU. No additional investigations&#xD;
      or interventions were done primarily for the study. Standardized care based on current&#xD;
      guidelines was provided to all the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rater (GK) was given one page hand-out with written instructions describing both the FOUR&#xD;
      score and the GCS. The GCS and the FOUR score applied by the rater within two hours of&#xD;
      admission and before starting sedatives or neuromuscular blockade. The rater was primary&#xD;
      investigator in all the patients. The sequence of application of the scores was randomized&#xD;
      using block randomization with block size of 10 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severity of illness was assessed by PIM2 score16. For PIM2, the values of various variables&#xD;
      at time of admission to Pediatric ward/PICU were recorded. PIM 2-based mortality index was&#xD;
      evaluated based on the regression equation as published in the literature.The children with&#xD;
      impaired consciousness and reduced mental state were classified as obtunded, stuporous or&#xD;
      comatose based on classification given by Taylor et al.17 The etiology was determined based&#xD;
      on review of the clinical, laboratory and imaging data by the Pediatric Neurologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient was followed till discharge/ in-hospital mortality. The functional outcome of the&#xD;
      patients was assessed by the Pediatric Overall Performance Category (POPC)18 at the time of&#xD;
      PICU discharge or 1 month following admission whichever was earlier. This scale ranges in&#xD;
      value from 1 to 6 with a value of 1 indicating normal functioning and a value of 6 indicating&#xD;
      brain death. Children were considered to have poor outcomes if they scored 3-6 on the POPC&#xD;
      scale, consistent with moderate to severe disability to vegetative state, coma or brain&#xD;
      death. The POPC score was obtained through direct questions about the child's ability to&#xD;
      perform age-appropriate activities, use of rehabilitative services, and physical&#xD;
      disabilities.&#xD;
