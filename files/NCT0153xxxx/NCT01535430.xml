      Purpose of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 1 Prospectively collect pre-operative (fMRI, DTI, MEG) and intra-operative mapping data&#xD;
      in patients with intra-axial brain tumors to assess how well each modality predicts the&#xD;
      location of eloquent brain function. In addition, each modality will be compared with the&#xD;
      other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 2 Assess reorganization of eloquent brain function and plasticity in patients with&#xD;
      intra-axial brain tumors. This will be accomplished by prospectively collecting&#xD;
      post-operative mapping studies and neuropsychological tests to compare them to prior mapping&#xD;
      studies as stated above.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Any patient with a primary or metastatic brain tumor in or near an eloquent area would be&#xD;
      eligible for participation in the study assuming no contraindications to any of the studies&#xD;
      or operative procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-operative:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation will include clinical evaluation, neuropsychological testing, MRI brain with and&#xD;
      without contrast, fMRI, DTI tractograms, and MEG studies as well as standard pre-operative&#xD;
      work-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intra-operative:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All non-invasive pre-operative mapping data will be incorporated into the operative procedure&#xD;
      with the imaging tools that we routinely use during neurosurgical procedures. Patients will&#xD;
      have awake mapping performed. Our usual standards of care will be followed during craniotomy,&#xD;
      mapping, and tumor resection or biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will have routine post-operative care and assessment consisting of clinical&#xD;
      examinations and imaging obtained within 24 hours post resection. They will have routine&#xD;
      follow-up outpatient appointments after surgery which will include neurologic assessment and&#xD;
      follow-up imaging (MRI with and without contrast) for their tumors as appropriate. The&#xD;
      experimental portion of the protocol is incorporating repeat neuropsychological testing and&#xD;
      mapping studies (fMRI, DTI, MEG) studies at 2 and 6 months post-surgery into their routine&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;

    <description>The location of the eloquent function of interest (motor, sensory, speech) will be assessed pre-operatively and intra-operatively. These will be compared. Then, at 2 and 6 months post-operatively, repeat non-invasive mapping studies will be performed to compare to the subjects' prior studies. This will allow for assessment of reorganization and plasticity of function. Addtionally, novel ways of identifying eloquent brain regions will be developed.</description>
