  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With current chemotherapy protocols, in 60-80% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML)&#xD;
      the leukemic blasts in the bone marrow can be reduced to &lt; 5%. This is called &quot;complete&#xD;
      remission (CR)&quot; and is the prerequisite for cure of the disease. During the last years,&#xD;
      several genetic and biologic risk factors for the achievement of CR have been defined, and&#xD;
      the remission rates vary considerably between patient groups with different risk profiles. On&#xD;
      one hand, patients with certain chromosomal or molecular aberrations have very high CR rates&#xD;
      of approximately 90%. Moreover, in some of these patients, molecularly targeted therapies for&#xD;
      specific genetic aberrations are currently evaluated in clinical trials. However, these&#xD;
      genetic aberrations account for only 50-60% of the overall patient population in AML. The&#xD;
      remaining patients have a significantly inferior CR rate of only 50-60% with 30% resistant&#xD;
      disease after two cycles of standard induction chemotherapy. In conclusion, there is need for&#xD;
      improved induction regimens in a large number of adult patients with AML. An improved CR rate&#xD;
      in this patient population will increase the number of patients eligible for intensive&#xD;
      consolidation such as an allogeneic stem cell transplantation and might thereby be the basis&#xD;
      for a better overall outcome. However, there is no clear evidence that this goal can be&#xD;
      achieved with the currently available chemotherapy protocols. Clofarabine&#xD;
      (2-chloro-2-fluoro-deoxy-9-D-arabinofuranosyladenine) is a nucleoside analogon which combines&#xD;
      properties of fludarabine and cladribine. Due to the lack of neurological side effects,&#xD;
      clofarabine could be explored in higher doses than other nucleoside analogues and has shown&#xD;
      considerable antileukemic activity in patients with relapsed or refractory acute leukemias&#xD;
      and elderly AML patients alone or in combination with cytarabine. In addition, the&#xD;
      combination of clofarabine, cytarabine and idarubicin has produced promising results with&#xD;
      acceptable toxicity in patients with relapsed or refractory AML. Based on these initial&#xD;
      studies, there is need for a further optimization of the clofarabine dose in this&#xD;
      combination. The aim of the AMLSG 17-10 study is therefore to evaluate the tolerability and&#xD;
      safety of increasing doses of clofarabine in combination with idarubicin/cytarabine in&#xD;
      patients with high risk AML defined by the genetic and molecular risk profile.&#xD;
