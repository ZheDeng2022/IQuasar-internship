      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Researchers are interested in studying the roles that genes play in drug and alcohol&#xD;
      addiction. Genes seem to account for about half of the differences between people who become&#xD;
      addicted to drugs and people who do not. This study will collect blood and skin cell samples.&#xD;
      These cells will be used to develop stem cells that are useful for studying how genes are&#xD;
      related to drug use and dependence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study genetic and cellular differences between people who are addicted to drugs and&#xD;
      those who are not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals between 21 and 65 years of age who do not use drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals between 21 and 65 years of age who are in treatment with buprenorphine or&#xD;
           methadone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a brief physical exam and medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will also answer questions about physical and mental health, quality of&#xD;
           life, and history of drug and alcohol use. A urine sample and cheek swab sample will be&#xD;
           collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants whose genetic samples match the study requirements will be asked to come&#xD;
           back to provide a skin biopsy sample and a second urine sample.&#xD;

      Background - The molecular- and cellular-based mechanisms that contribute to the initiation&#xD;
      and development of addiction remain to be elucidated. Estimates have suggested that 40-60&#xD;
      percent of the vulnerability to addiction may be attributable to genetic aberrations.&#xD;
      Multiple chromosomal regions have been linked to addiction including those containing the&#xD;
      dopamine transporter (DAT) and vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT2) genes. Current efforts&#xD;
      to understand how polymorphisms in these monoamine transporters contribute to the molecular&#xD;
      mechanisms of addiction are severely hindered by the inability to directly interrogate neural&#xD;
      cell types from the patients. There is great potential for patient-specific iPS cell&#xD;
      technology to profoundly impact our understanding of human development and disease by&#xD;
      providing genetically distinct, functional sources of human cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective - The objective of the research is to develop a cell-based system whereby neural&#xD;
      cells from afflicted individuals can be functionally assayed to interrogate the molecular&#xD;
      mechanisms underlying addiction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population Controls (non-drug users) and opioid dependent adults receiving opioid&#xD;
      agonist therapy aged 21- 65 will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design Participants demographic characteristics, psychosocial evaluation, and psychiatric,&#xD;
      medical, and drug use histories will be characterized. DNA will be collected via cheek swabs&#xD;
      of up to 30 potential participants for determination of dopamine transporter (DAT) and&#xD;
      vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT2) gene polymorphisms. Participants (N=16) with suitable&#xD;
      polymorphisms will be asked to under go skin biopsies; 2 individuals for each of two&#xD;
      genotypes for each gene (DAT or VMAT), i.e., 8 samples from addicts and 8 samples for control&#xD;
      subjects. Collaborators at Case Western Reserve University will use the skin cells to derive&#xD;
      and characterize patient-specific, induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells that carry monoamine&#xD;
      transporter polymorphisms for the hDAT1 and hVMAT2 genes. They will differentiate&#xD;
      patient-specific iPS cells line into dopaminergic neurons and carry out a detailed and&#xD;
      functional characterization of these cells to identify their molecular characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures - Biological specimens from the addiction patients and controls will be used&#xD;
      to derive and characterize patient-specific, induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells that carry&#xD;
      monoamine transporter polymorphisms. Patient-specific iPS cells lines will be differentiated&#xD;
      into dopaminergic neurons. In follow up studies, we will characterize, compare, and&#xD;
      functionally assay these patient-specific, iPS cell-derived dopaminergic neurons from control&#xD;
      and addiction patients that carry polymorphisms for hDAT1 and hVMAT2 gene to investigate any&#xD;
      possible association with dopamine neurotransmission variations and vulnerability to&#xD;
      addiction.&#xD;
