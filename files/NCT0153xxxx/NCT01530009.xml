      The goal of this study is to determine whether amoxicillin (AMX) alone has an appreciable&#xD;
      effect on upper gastrointestinal motility compared to placebo. In particular, induction of&#xD;
      phase III of the interdigestive migrating motor complex (MMC) by AMX will be the primary&#xD;
      outcome of the study. MMCs are periodic waves of electrical activity resulting in muscular&#xD;
      contractions that pass through the walls of the stomach and intestinal tract during the&#xD;
      fasting state. It is characterized by an initial period where there is a minimal electrical&#xD;
      activity and muscular contraction (phase I), followed by a gradual increase in the frequency&#xD;
      of contractions (phase III) that often leads to a characteristic cluster of contractions&#xD;
      (phase III). This cycle occurs only in the fasting state in normal individuals and the&#xD;
      frequency of phase III is quite varied, dependent on age and the presence of any underlying&#xD;
      abnormalities in gastrointestinal motility. Secondary outcomes will include characteristics&#xD;
      of the MMC, patient demographics in responders and non-responders, and the safety profile of&#xD;
      AMX at the intervention dose.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Motility disorders are common in childhood and can present with a variety of symptoms&#xD;
      including recurrent vomiting, abdominal pain and distension. They are often the reason for&#xD;
      multiple medical visits and can be associated with significantly impaired quality of life in&#xD;
      severe cases. There are a limited number of available medications used to improve motility in&#xD;
      the stomach and small bowel, which include dopamine-receptor antagonists, serotonergic agents&#xD;
      and antibiotics such as erythromycin. Among the latter group, amoxicillin-clavulanate (AMC)&#xD;
      has been shown to enhance fasting small intestinal motility in adults and children. The&#xD;
      mechanism of action is not currently known though theories include indirect release of an&#xD;
      intraluminal mediator such as motilin, or direct interaction of the β-lactam moiety with&#xD;
      γ-aminobutyric acid receptors in the myenteric plexus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AMC is a combination of amoxicillin (AMX) with clavulanic acid (CA), a β-lactamase inhibitor.&#xD;
      This modification of the drug results in a broader spectrum of antibacterial activity to&#xD;
      include AMX sensitive and β-lactamase-producing strains. Although both AMX and AMC are&#xD;
      generally well tolerated, AMX can be associated with fewer adverse effects due to the&#xD;
      presence of the CA moiety in AMC. AMC is associated with a higher frequency of nausea,&#xD;
      vomiting and transient diarrhea compared to AMX. In a study of outpatient children, patients&#xD;
      on AMC have been shown to have an increased risk of antibiotic-associated diarrhea.&#xD;
      Drug-related liver injury is also more common in patients taking AMC. Furthermore, it is&#xD;
      advisable to use the most narrow spectrum antibiotic that demonstrates clinical efficacy in&#xD;
      light of the emergence of β-lactam-β-lactamase inhibitor-resistant bacterial strains&#xD;
      accelerated by excess antibiotic use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AMX has a good safety profile and is frequently prescribed for children by community&#xD;
      physicians based on history and physical examination alone. It is the recommended first line&#xD;
      treatment in common childhood illnesses such as upper respiratory infections, including ear&#xD;
      and sinus infections, and community-acquired pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to determine whether a single dose of AMX has an appreciable effect&#xD;
      on upper gastrointestinal motility compared to placebo. In particular, induction of phase III&#xD;
      of the interdigestive migrating motor complex (MMC) by AMX will be the primary outcome of the&#xD;
      study. MMCs are periodic waves of electrical activity resulting in muscular contractions that&#xD;
      pass through the walls of the stomach and intestinal tract during the fasting state. It is&#xD;
      characterized by an initial period where there is a minimal electrical activity and muscular&#xD;
      contraction (phase I), followed by a gradual increase in the frequency of contractions (phase&#xD;
      III) that often leads to a characteristic cluster of contractions (phase III). This cycle&#xD;
      occurs only in the fasting state in normal individuals and the frequency of phase III is&#xD;
      quite varied, dependent on age and the presence of any underlying abnormalities in&#xD;
      gastrointestinal motility. Secondary outcomes will include characteristics of the MMC,&#xD;
      patient demographics in responders and non-responders, and the safety profile of AMX at the&#xD;
      intervention dose.&#xD;
