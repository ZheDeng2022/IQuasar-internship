  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The I-START trial is designed to determine the highest doses of radiotherapy that can safely&#xD;
      be used in locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients with NSCLC who are&#xD;
      expected to live longer than three months and are fit to receive radical radiotherapy&#xD;
      (radiotherapy given with curative intent) will be eligible to participate. All trial&#xD;
      participants will receive 20 doses (called fractions) of radiotherapy. Evidence is available&#xD;
      that suggests increasing the dose of radiotherapy given per fraction may improve both local&#xD;
      control of the cancer and survival in some patients. However, high dose radiotherapy can&#xD;
      damage normal tissues as well as the tumour. The dose of radiotherapy that can be used to&#xD;
      treat lung cancer is limited by the normal tissues close to the cancer. For most of these&#xD;
      normal tissues (lung, spinal cord and heart) the maximum safe radiotherapy dose that can be&#xD;
      given is known. The maximum safe dose of radiotherapy for the oesophagus (gullet) is not&#xD;
      currently known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will be split into two parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. For those participants where the oesophagus will receive a high dose of radiation due to&#xD;
           it lying close to the cancer, the first part of the trial will establish the maximum&#xD;
           safe dose of radiotherapy to the oesophagus. The first group of participants will&#xD;
           receive a slightly higher dose than is currently used to treat lung cancer. If these&#xD;
           participants do not have any significant side effects, a second group of participants&#xD;
           will receive a slightly higher dose than the first group. This process will continue&#xD;
           incrementally until side effects from the treatment become evident, thus demonstrating&#xD;
           the maximum dose that can safely be given. Once the maximum safe dose to the oesophagus&#xD;
           is known this will be classed as the recommended Phase II dose and all further patients&#xD;
           entering the trial will receive no more than this dose to the oesophagus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. For those participants where the cancer is a safe distance from their oesophagus, the&#xD;
           highest dose of radiotherapy that does not exceed the known safe dose limits of the&#xD;
           normal structures (lung, spinal cord and heart) will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The findings of both parts of this study will determine whether increasing the dose of&#xD;
      radiotherapy for NSCLC patients is a tolerable, safe and effective treatment. If the results&#xD;
      are positive then this new treatment may be compared against the best currently available&#xD;
      standard treatments in a future larger randomised (Phase III) trial.&#xD;
