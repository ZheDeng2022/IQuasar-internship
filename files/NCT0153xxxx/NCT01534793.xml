      This observational study aims at describing the learning curve of the Holmium Enucleation of&#xD;
      the Prostate (HoLEP) technique using a LUMENIS laser device by senior attending urologists.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicentre observational study studying the learning curve of the&#xD;
      HoLEP procedure, through auto-evaluation of the quality of the surgery by senior attending&#xD;
      urologists introducing HoLEP in their current clinical practice. This is a single arm, not&#xD;
      comparative study. The primary outcome is the ability of each surgeon to perform 4 HoLEP&#xD;
      procedures successfully, according to a pre-defined surgical performance scale [varying from&#xD;
      0 to 5]. To be successful, a procedure must be scored 5/5. Each procedure is evaluated at the&#xD;
      end of the surgical act by the surgeon himself. As secondary outcomes, the short term&#xD;
      efficacy and safety parameters of the HoLEP technique will be evaluated through the following&#xD;
      data prospectively collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  I-PSS symptom score (15 days before operation, at 6 and 12 months postoperative)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  I-PSS bother score (15 days before operation, at 1, 6 and 12 months postoperative)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  DAN-PSSsex score (15 days before operation, at 6 and 12 months postoperative)Global&#xD;
           sexual satisfaction (15 days before operation, at 6 and 12 months postoperative)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of life score QoL-Europe (15 days before operation, and at 12 months&#xD;
           postoperative)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urinary flow rate I-PSS symptom score (15 days before operation, at day 0, and at 1, 6&#xD;
           and 12 months postoperative)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Postvoid residual volume (15 days before operation, at day 0, and at 1, 6 and 12 months&#xD;
           postoperative)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ultrasound examination of the prostate (15 days before operation, at 6 and 12 months&#xD;
           postoperative)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PSA blood testing (15 days before operation, at 6 and 12 months postoperative)One month&#xD;
           post-operative questionnaire at one month post-operative&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of adverse events (the day of operation, at 1, 6 and 12 months postoperative)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Satisfaction of the intervention (at 1 and 12 months postoperative)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pathologic examination of the prostate tissue (at 1 months postoperative)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood levels of sodium, haemoglobin, and haematocrit (15 days before intervention,&#xD;
           immediately after intervention,)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time needed for each step of the procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  prostatic capsule contact&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  enucleation of the median lobe&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  enucleation of the lateral lobes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  hemostasis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  morcellation Laser data (duration, Joules number number of fibers used, fibre type,&#xD;
           morcellator ans nephroscope type)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tissue weight&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Irrigation volume&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Need for coagulation with another device&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse events during the procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Type of catheter after surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Duration of the catheterization&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post-operative irrigation (duration, volume, type)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hospital stay. The indications of the surgery are the usual indications for bladder&#xD;
           outlet obstruction relief in ta context of low urinary tract symptoms due to benign&#xD;
           prostatic hyperplasia, as an alternative to the other level 1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Grade A recommended surgical techniques. The profile of every surgeon will be recorded&#xD;
           in terms of surgical experience with age, number of previous endoscopic prostatic&#xD;
           surgical procedures, number of laser procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design is scheduled as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inclusion visit (between D-25 and D-5 before surgery), for inclusion written informed&#xD;
           consent as assessment of baseline data&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surgical intervention (D0): performed as previously described in the literature, with&#xD;
           assessment of perioperative data&#xD;
