  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research deals with behaviors that are part of opioid dependence. The purpose is to&#xD;
      study the extent to which stress and other factors, including money and amount of work&#xD;
      effort, affect opioid choice. Specifically, the investigators will examine the effects of&#xD;
      three issues/factors. The first is how hard participants are willing to work to obtain an&#xD;
      opioid drug; the second is how much opioid drug would participants choose instead of money;&#xD;
      and the third factor is how much participant's opioid drug choices are influenced after they&#xD;
      are administered the drugs yohimbine and hydrocortisone, both of which could produce&#xD;
      stress-like symptoms.&#xD;

      Phase 1: Participants will first be an outpatient and must come to the Tolan Park Medical&#xD;
      Building daily to receive buprenorphine doses. This phase will last at least 10 days or&#xD;
      longer. Three times per week during the first two weeks (i.e., on 6 different days),&#xD;
      participants will be asked to provide urine samples and to complete questionnaires that ask&#xD;
      about opiate withdrawal symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: Participants will then live on an inpatient research unit (located in Detroit&#xD;
      Michigan) for at least 16 consecutive nights and possibly up to 18 consecutive nights.&#xD;
      Participants will continue on the same dose of buprenorphine as in phase 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this stay they will participate in a total of 11 experimental sessions. Participants&#xD;
      will take part in multiple trials in which they have the opportunity to choose drug,&#xD;
      hydromorphone, or money. Hydromorphone is a heroin-like opioid. During the first two test&#xD;
      sessions, participants will receive a sample of the drug doses that can be chosen. Before&#xD;
      each of the final 9 test sessions begin, participants will be given a capsule containing&#xD;
      either different doses of the drug yohimbine or a placebo (blank). Yohimbine is a drug that&#xD;
      has been shown to produce a &quot;stress&quot;-like response in humans. Then participants will be given&#xD;
      a capsule that contains either different doses of the drug hydrocortisone or a placebo&#xD;
      (blank). Hydrocortisone is also a drug that can produce a &quot;stress&quot;-like response in humans.&#xD;
      Then participants will have the opportunity to choose either drug or money by using a&#xD;
      computer to earn choices. Respiration rate, oxygen saturation, heart rate, and blood pressure&#xD;
      will be monitored throughout choice trials. Self-report questionnaires will be completed at&#xD;
      different times during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3: After participants have completed the experimental procedures, they will again come&#xD;
      to the Tolan Park Medical Building daily to receive buprenorphine doses. The dose of&#xD;
      buprenorphine will be gradually decreased so that they will eventually be free from&#xD;
      medication. This will take three weeks. We will administer questionnaires and collect urine&#xD;
      samples three times each week.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Opioid dependent, as determined by structured clinical interview for DSM-IV (SCID) and&#xD;
             Addiction Severity Index (ASI)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive urine test for opiates&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing to use an adequate form of contraception for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Reads and writes English&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must be in generally good health to be eligible. All candidates will&#xD;
             receive a routine medical exam (history and physical) with standard laboratory tests&#xD;
             (including blood and urine samples, EKG, mandatory TB testing, and voluntary HIV&#xD;
             testing).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No candidate who has a current DSM-IV Axis I disorder other than Drug Dependence or a&#xD;
             history of serious psychiatric problems (e.g. psychosis, bipolar or major depression)&#xD;
             will be allowed to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Candidates meeting criteria for opioid or nicotine dependence will not be excluded,&#xD;
             but those with other Substance Dependence disorders will be excluded. Those with Abuse&#xD;
             of Alcohol, Cannabis, Cocaine, or Benzodiazepines will not be excluded, but&#xD;
             participants must provide an alcohol free breath specimen, and a benzodiazepine free&#xD;
             urine sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No candidate with medical (neurological, cardiovascular, pulmonary or systemic)&#xD;
             disorders will be allowed to participate. This will be determined with history and&#xD;
             physical exam, standard laboratory testing (blood and urine), EKG, and TB tests (to&#xD;
             avoid transmitting this communicable disease on the residential unit or in the&#xD;
             laboratory).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Candidates with evidence of cognitive impairment (based on reading ability and&#xD;
             comprehension, will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;

             adequate birth control methods (self-report) will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Candidates with injection phobia, or seeking treatment for opioid dependence will be&#xD;
             excluded.&#xD;
