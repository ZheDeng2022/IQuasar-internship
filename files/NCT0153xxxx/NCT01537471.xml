      The purpose of the investigators research is to test whether problems people have with&#xD;
      processing their senses (feeling overwhelmed, distracted or upset by sounds and other&#xD;
      stimuli) can be lessened by meclizine, a drug found in many over the counter antihistamines,&#xD;
      which are medicines used for things like allergies, sleep problems, or the common cold.&#xD;

      This experiment will test the efficacy of acute anti-histamine doses on the acoustic startle&#xD;
      response and prepulse inhibition (or PPI, a well-known neurobehavioral phenomenon used to&#xD;
      characterize sensorimotor modulation described in detail below) in a male population with&#xD;
      high baseline sensory startle levels. In addition, sex differences in baseline PPI (i.e.&#xD;
      without anti-histamine administration) in subjects of this population will be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main hypothesis of the study is that the H1Â¬-antagonist meclizine will be effective in&#xD;
      restoring low levels of PPI observed in the subject pool so that sensory gating is made more&#xD;
      effective. The dependent measures will be startle response magnitude and pre-pulse&#xD;
      inhibition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experiment will take place in four sessions, carried out on different days. Consecutive&#xD;
      test sessions will take place no earlier than 3 days, and no longer than 21 days apart.&#xD;
      Before being recruited into the study, potential participants will go through a phone&#xD;
      screen-a pre-experiment screening questionnaire (separate) to exclude subjects with&#xD;
      neurological disorders, certain psychiatric disorders, who smoke or use nicotine products, or&#xD;
      who use certain drugs (see exclusion criteria below) as they can affect PPI levels. If they&#xD;
      are eligible per the phone screen, subjects will come in for screening (test day 1). They&#xD;
      will be again asked about their tobacco/nicotine use and what medications they are currently&#xD;
      taking. They will be asked about their caffeine history use. Caffeine and caffeine withdrawal&#xD;
      both have effects on startle response but not on PPI so we are not restricting subject's&#xD;
      caffeine use, but collecting this information. CO levels will be collected using a CO monitor&#xD;
      to confirm that participants have not recently used a tobacco product. They will be asked&#xD;
      questions about psychiatric symptoms, personality, and how they cope with stress.&#xD;
      Participants' startle responses and PPI will be tested in the laboratory (see below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the following three test days (2-4) before dispensing study drug, male participants&#xD;
      who qualify, will be asked to fill out a questionnaire about tobacco or nicotine use since&#xD;
      their previous visit along with assessing any change in their medications (specifically&#xD;
      verifying that a male participant has not used an allergy, cold/flu medication within 3 days&#xD;
      of their study visit). If the participant answers yes to either question, they will be asked&#xD;
      to return to the clinic on a different day: 1) 3 or more days post using an antihistamine or&#xD;
      2) at least 2 weeks post using tobacco or nicotine. Both antihistamine medications or&#xD;
      tobacco/nicotine recent use can effect a participant's PPI which is why we have the need to&#xD;
      ask male participants about any possible changes. They will also be asked how they arrived to&#xD;
      the clinic to verify that they have a driver who came with them/dropped them off, had a hired&#xD;
      driver provided by the study if they live in Durham or came by bus or by foot. They will be&#xD;
      asked about their caffeine use on the day of their experiment. Their baseline sedation level&#xD;
      will be assessed. On test days 2-4, the test procedure employed on test day 1 will be&#xD;
      repeated, but 60 minutes before the start of each test sessions, participants will receive a&#xD;
      placebo, a low (12.5 mg) dose of meclizine, or a high (25 mg) dose of this drug in a&#xD;
      counterbalanced order.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Male participants (n = 20) will receive the study medication or placebo orally and will be&#xD;
      provided water at administration at visits Day 2-4. Placebo and meclizine capsules will be&#xD;
      identical in shape, size, and color. The randomization and counterbalancing of the order of&#xD;
      dosing will be in charge of Dr. Levin. In order to ensure that the blind procedure is not&#xD;
      violated, Dr. Levin (a) will provide the identical capsules for the study to the Study&#xD;
      Coordinator in containers labeled &quot;Subject X, day Y&quot;, and (b) will have no contact with the&#xD;
      participants in the study. Meclizine and placebo will be dispensed by the Study Coordinator&#xD;
      under the administrative supervision of Dr. Rosenthal, and under the clinical supervision of&#xD;
      a study physician. During the resting period between pill ingestion and the experimental&#xD;
      task, male participants will be asked to sit in a lab room and read or use the internet. At&#xD;
      20 minutes and 40 minutes post drug, sedation level will be assessed using the scale listed&#xD;
      below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each PPI test session throughout all 4 visits, male participants will begin with a resting&#xD;
      baseline period of 5 minutes, where they will be asked to sit quietly and still in a sound&#xD;
      and temperature controlled lab room, with their eyes open looking at a fixation cross on the&#xD;
      monitor. Baseline is conducted to obtain measures of emotional arousal and sedation prior to&#xD;
      the experimental manipulations. As such, during baseline psychophysiological measures will be&#xD;
      collected. Self-reported emotional arousal will be obtained at the beginning and end of the&#xD;
      baseline period using the Self-Assessment Manikin (Bradley, 1999), which assesses arousal and&#xD;
      valence of affective state using Likert (1-9) scales. Self-reported level of sedation will be&#xD;
      assessed at the same time points as emotional arousal (using a modified Self-Assessment&#xD;
      Manikin using the same Likert 1-9 scale). Next, participants will be exposed to an initial&#xD;
      adaptation phase, in order for them to become acquainted with the startle stimuli (pulses and&#xD;
      prepulses), and their startle responses reach a stable level. In this phase, 4 blocks of&#xD;
      prepulse-pulse (pP) and pulse-alone (P) trials will be presented, with an inter-trial&#xD;
      interval (ITI) of 20 seconds (+/- 5 sec). After the initial adaptation phase, participants&#xD;
      will be instructed to view a computer monitor where random geometric figures will be&#xD;
      presented, while simultaneously 10 blocks of auditory pP and P trials will be presented with&#xD;
      an ITI of 20 sec. Each test session will last around 15 minutes. At the end of the test&#xD;
      session, the standardized lab test to assess the participants' attention level described&#xD;
      above will be presented again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Females will only complete the first day of testing (in the same way as described for male&#xD;
      subjects above).&#xD;

    <description>The primary outcome will measure change in subjects' PPI depending on whether they were given meclizine during the study. Prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the startle reflex by a weak pre-pulse will be assessed during each laboratory session. It is measured using electromyographic (EMG; i.e., for assessing eye blink magnitude) responses.</description>

    <description>A Baseline sedation level at the beginning of each visit will be collected. Then study drug (meclizine/placebo) will be given and a sedation level will be collected at 20 minutes and 40 minutes post drug as well as during the PPI experiment pre &amp; post.
