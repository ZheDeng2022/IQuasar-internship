  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Norwegian government has funded a pilot study of a national colorectal cancer screening&#xD;
      programme. This implies initiation of a screening pilot in the catchment area for two&#xD;
      hospitals in Norway. The target population is average risk men and women at age 50-74 years.&#xD;
      The programme is designed as a comparative effectiveness programme evaluating acceptance and&#xD;
      test performance for two screening methods - fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) and flexible&#xD;
      sigmoidoscopy (FS). This protocol describes the main methodological issues, necessary&#xD;
      resources and the expected effects.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are several candidate screening modalities - fecal occult blood (FOBT), flexible&#xD;
      sigmoidoscopy, colonoscopy, CT and MRI colonography and a range of molecular markers. Of&#xD;
      these, only FOBT and FS have been subjected to long-term follow-up in randomised trials&#xD;
      (RCTs). These two modalities will be tested in a head-to-head comparison by 1:1&#xD;
      randomisation. Previous studies have suggested that the attendance for FS may be lower than&#xD;
      for FOBT. However, participation has been shown to decline with repetitive rounds required&#xD;
      for FOBT, while infrequent or once-only screening may suffice for FS. A better test&#xD;
      performance for FS makes it uncertain which method may be most beneficial in a public health&#xD;
      perspective. This is the first time a national screening programme is designed as a platform&#xD;
      for comparative effectiveness studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pilot study will be carried out in two hospital catchment areas in South-East Norway -&#xD;
      each with a target population of 70,000 men and women at 50-74 years of age - altogether&#xD;
      140,000 individuals to be randomised 1:1 between screening with an immunochemical test for&#xD;
      faecal occult blood (iFOBT) biennially or FS once only. The primary endpoint is colorectal&#xD;
      mortality reduction after 10 years. Attendance for FS is expected to be 50% and 60% for&#xD;
      iFOBT. Expected CRC mortality reduction is 30% (286 CRC deaths) in the FS arm and 15% (143&#xD;
      CRC deaths) in the iFOBT arm (intention-to-treat). In a 1:1 randomisation with 80%&#xD;
      statistical power and a significance level of 5% it will require 70,000 individuals in each&#xD;
      arm to disclose a statistically significant difference between FS and iFOBT screening in an&#xD;
      intention-to-treat model. We expect 5% in the iFOBTs group to test positive and require&#xD;
      colonoscopy work-up. A positive FS is defined as 'any advanced neoplasia' (CRC, adenoma&#xD;
      &gt;10mm, adenoma with high-grade dysplasia or villous components). A finding of advanced&#xD;
      neoplasia is expected in 5% of FS requiring full colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study entry-date: All individuals were randomized to each of the two groups (iFOBT or&#xD;
      sigmoidoscopy) before study start. Because first round screening of the iFOBT arm (70,000&#xD;
      invitees) will be finished in a shorter time frame compared to sigmoidoscopy, invitees in the&#xD;
      flexible sigmoidoscopy arm are prone to more relevant time-dependent events between&#xD;
      randomization and time of screening actually being offered. Therefore, primary entry-date was&#xD;
      defined as day of mailed invitation in both screening groups. This approach means that the&#xD;
      mean age at invitation in the sigmoidoscopy screening group will be older than in the iFOBT&#xD;
      group, and analyses have to take this age-difference into account. Randomization date was&#xD;
      chosen as a secondary study entry date to allow comparative analysis of effects of choosing&#xD;
      the two entry date definitions. Sub-studies on lifestyle, psychological reactions comparing&#xD;
      participants and control groups not invited to screening from neighbouring municipalities are&#xD;
      performed. A randomized sub-study comparing various premedication in work-up colonoscopies is&#xD;
      also performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-studies&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Changes in modifiable lifestyle factors such as not smoking, normal weight, high level&#xD;
           of physical activity may reduce the risk of CRC. Correlation between these factors and&#xD;
           endoscopic findings will be assessed. Limited intervention will be tested to improve&#xD;
           life style.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The effect of screening on Psychological factors and the willingness to repeat screening&#xD;
           will be assessed&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Creation of a validated Sigmoidoscopy Bowel Preparation scale with subsequent testing of&#xD;
           various bowel preparation modalities will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. RCT with various strategies og analgesia during colonoscopy will be tested to improve&#xD;
           patient experience.&#xD;
