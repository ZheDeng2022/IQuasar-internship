  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is the treatment of choice for patients with Hepatitis&#xD;
      C Virus (HCV) infection and end-stage liver disease or hepatocellular carcinoma; infection of&#xD;
      the graft and hepatitis C recurrence is universal after OLT and recurrent HCV hepatitis often&#xD;
      follows an accelerated course after OLT, with rapid histological recurrence and cirrhosis.&#xD;
      These very poor outcome significantly affect graft and patient survival and reduces the&#xD;
      benefit of transplantation for this indication. Therapeutic strategies are not available;&#xD;
      high viral load, high prevalence of genotype 1b and need of dose reduction of interferon and&#xD;
      ribavirin because of the side effects or intolerance, together with the interference of&#xD;
      immunosuppressive drugs, resulted in the vast majority of the patients in failure in&#xD;
      obtaining viral eradication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, Silibinin, has been studied and reported to be capable to act as potent antiviral&#xD;
      agent in patients with HCV; it has been used successfully in a protocol of a 14 day&#xD;
      intravenous infusion in previous non-responders to peginterferon/ribavirin therapy. In view&#xD;
      of his postulated profile of safety, it seems an ideal drug to be used in the setting of HCV&#xD;
      recurrent patients after liver transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of this prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study&#xD;
      is to determine the therapeutic effect of Legalon SIL in the prevention of HCV reinfection in&#xD;
      chronically infected hepatitis C patients after OLT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Awaiting orthotopic liver transplantation patients affected by HCV will be randomised 3:1 to&#xD;
      receive, in addition to their current therapy, silibinin 20mg/kg/day (Legalon SIL) or placebo&#xD;
      infused over 2 hours from 14 to 21 consecutive days; in addition, patients will receive&#xD;
      treatment with silibinin 20mg/kg/day (Legalon SIL), infused over 2 hours, for 7 days after&#xD;
      transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Primary Efficacy endpoint is to achieve sustained virological response (SVR) while&#xD;
      Secondary Efficacy endpoints are to evaluate the virologic response, the percentage of&#xD;
      patients who has a decreased of at least 2 log10 the levels of HCV-RNA and the safety of&#xD;
      Legalon SIL in this population.&#xD;
