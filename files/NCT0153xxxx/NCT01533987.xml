    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine the effects of daily ingestion of Juice Plus+®&#xD;
      capsules containing Orchard, Garden and Vineyard blends on endothelial function and&#xD;
      biomarkers of oxidative stress (oxidized LDL, lipid hydroperoxides and protein carbonyls) in&#xD;
      overweight men as compared to the placebo group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of obesity in both adults and children in the United States has increased&#xD;
      significantly over the past 50 years. More than 66% of adults in the US are now overweight or&#xD;
      obese and at least 17% of children in the population at large are now considered overweight.&#xD;
      Obesity may be a factor predisposing patients to a myriad of different comorbidities that&#xD;
      increase the associated mortality rate. Several large prospective trials have documented that&#xD;
      obesity is an independent risk factor for all-cause mortality from cardiovascular disease&#xD;
      (CVD). Considering the major metabolic and biochemical changes that occur in obesity, such as&#xD;
      atherogenic dyslipidemia, insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia, endothelial dysfunction,&#xD;
      and chronic inflammatory and prothrombotic states, obesity plays a role in the pathogenesis&#xD;
      of systemic atherosclerosis and its clinical complications. Antioxidants are thought to help&#xD;
      preserve the endothelium's capacity to generate NO, which acts to promote vasodilation,&#xD;
      stabilize platelets, and promote the anti-inflammatory abilities of the endothelium. Juice&#xD;
      Plus+® Capsules containing Orchard, Garden and Vineyard blends are rich in the traditional&#xD;
      antioxidants β-carotene, Vitamin E and Vitamin C along with other carotenoids and&#xD;
      phytonutrients. There is increasing attention to the possibility that micronutrients may&#xD;
      exert health effects in concert. Outcomes in studies of isolated micronutrients, such as&#xD;
      vitamin E, have often been often disappointing. Plant-derived micronutrients have the&#xD;
      potential to contribute to vascular health by offering the endothelium protection from&#xD;
      oxidative stress. Evidence of this anticipated effect would have implications for strategies&#xD;
      to prevent or retard cardiovascular disease. Endothelial function testing using&#xD;
      high-frequency ultrasound imaging of the brachial artery to assess endothelium-dependent&#xD;
      flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) offers a non-invasive, uniquely valuable means of assessing&#xD;
      aggregated influences on cardiac risk by gauging a physiologic response of the vascular&#xD;
      endothelium. Proposed, therefore, is a randomized, double-blinded and placebo-controlled&#xD;
      clinical trial of Juice Plus+® on endothelial function in overweight men with central&#xD;
      adiposity.&#xD;
