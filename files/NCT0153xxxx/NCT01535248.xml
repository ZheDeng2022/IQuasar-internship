  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is an endoscopy technique to visualize&#xD;
      and evaluate the pancreatic and biliary systems. It has been reported that rare instances of&#xD;
      air embolus have been found associated with the performance of an ERCP and many of these&#xD;
      events are fatal. It is our proposal to use transthoracic echocardiography to continuously&#xD;
      evaluate for the presence of intra-cardiac air secondary to ERCP venous air embolism and&#xD;
      attempt to quantify the incidence of this complication and any potential patient factors that&#xD;
      might increase the risk of this complication.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is commonly used in the diagnosis and&#xD;
      treatment of biliary and pancreatic disease. There are case reports presented in the&#xD;
      literature demonstrating adverse and often fatal events following air embolization associated&#xD;
      with the performance of ERCP. The frequency of air embolus is extremely rare with the exact&#xD;
      incidence unknown. In recent years the utilization of echocardiography to evaluate&#xD;
      individuals with hemodynamic instability has led to the discovery of intracardiac air embolus&#xD;
      seen in those individuals that demonstrated changes in either hemodynamic parameters or&#xD;
      capnography values. There exists proposed mechanisms for the translocation of air from the&#xD;
      foregut to the systemic venous circulation but not one of these mechanisms has yet been&#xD;
      validated. Some proposed mechanisms include either through intrahepatic mechanisms where air&#xD;
      crosses from the biliary tract to hepatic venules or potentially from the foregut into the&#xD;
      portal vein and through shunt vessels into systemic venous circulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exact frequency of air embolus is likely higher than the incidence of fatal or near-fatal&#xD;
      complications reported in the literature. Individuals that had the best outcomes were usually&#xD;
      intubated and had capnography to demonstrate a change suggestive of air embolus prior to&#xD;
      significant hemodynamic changes.1 As this phenomenon has not previously been well described,&#xD;
      it is possible that other patients suffer significant air embolus with myocardial or cerebral&#xD;
      ischemic sequelae that were not recognized because echocardiography was not used as an early&#xD;
      tool for evaluation of hemodynamically unstable patients. It is also possible that there are&#xD;
      a number of patients that may suffer a venous air embolus from ERCP that is sub-clinical and&#xD;
      therefore not causing enough change in cardiac function to alter either hemodynamic&#xD;
      parameters or capnography values. The literature suggests that if a patient does not awake&#xD;
      following ERCP, that imaging modalities, such as echocardiography be employed for&#xD;
      evaluation.1 Understanding the frequency of this problem or which subgroups are at risk can&#xD;
      further aid in the diagnosis and treatment of this complication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transthoracic echocardiography is a highly sensitive imaging modality and if adequate imaging&#xD;
      windows can be obtained will demonstrate the presence of intracardiac air. The risk of&#xD;
      performing the study on the patient is zero to very low. The potential risk of inaccurate&#xD;
      interpretation should be avoided by the use of trained individuals in the acquisition and&#xD;
      interpretation of transthoracic echocardiographic images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to 1) identify individuals scheduled to undergo elective ERCP as&#xD;
      part of their plan-of-care and perform transthoracic echocardiography for surveillance of&#xD;
      intracardiac air embolus 2) record aspects of their past medical history that may potentially&#xD;
      contribute to increased risk of systemic venous air embolus. This evaluation has not been&#xD;
      presented in the literature and the primary end-point of this study would be to determine the&#xD;
      frequency at which venous air embolus associated with ERCP occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All individuals that meet inclusion criteria will be approached and consented in the&#xD;
      pre-operative area prior to the planned procedure (ERCP). Their past medical history will be&#xD;
      reviewed with the patient and special attention placed on particular co-morbid conditions&#xD;
      that might be related to this phenomenon including but not limited to: portal hypertension,&#xD;
      cirrhosis, portal vein thrombosis, and recent liver biopsy. The patient will then proceed to&#xD;
      the procedure room as planned and while the patient is placed in the left lateral decubitus&#xD;
      position and induced under anesthesia. An echocardiography-trained anesthesiologist will&#xD;
      perform a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) concurrently while the gastroenterologist is&#xD;
      performing the ERCP. We plan on conducting serial images at least every ten to fifteen&#xD;
      minutes throughout the ERCP and more often as needed. At the conclusion of the procedure&#xD;
      (ERCP) if there are no significant findings on TTE the patient will be returned to the supine&#xD;
      position and taken to the recovery room. The written record of the TTE will then be entered&#xD;
      into the study database within a separate research chart. In the event that the TTE shows the&#xD;
      presence of intracardiac air embolus during the procedure the member of the study group&#xD;
      performing the TTE will notify the endoscopist and anesthesia provider of the findings if the&#xD;
      findings are significant enough to require a change in the patient's medical care. Reference&#xD;
      to the algorithm will be made in each case and be available online if needed. Unless a&#xD;
      moderate to severe embolic event occurs, the findings will not be communicated to the&#xD;
      gastroenterologist so that he is blinded to the result maintained in the research chart. The&#xD;
      purpose of this is to keep clinically insignificant emboli from being reported in the&#xD;
      patient's medical record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the key components of this evaluation is determining whether the presence of an air&#xD;
      embolus has occurred and if so, has it had a negative effect on the function of the subject's&#xD;
      cardiovascular system. Our proposed evaluation of the myocardium using transthoracic&#xD;
      echocardiography includes evaluation of the left ventricle, right ventricle and pulmonary&#xD;
      artery pressures. In the event there is hemodynamic instability as a result of impaired&#xD;
      function of the right or left ventricle, an evaluation including measurements of the&#xD;
      following parameters will assist in determination of the problem:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Right ventricular function, specifically tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion&#xD;
           (TAPSE and the presence of hemodynamic changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Left ventricular function, specifically diastolic function, systolic function and&#xD;
           myocardial performance index.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Pulmonary artery systolic pressure, via evaluation of the tricuspid regurgitant jet&#xD;
           maximum velocity using the modified Bernoulli equation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Presence of a new right-to-left intracardiac shunt or bowing of the intraatrial septum&#xD;
           from right-to-left indicating a new increase in the right atrial pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Significant changes in hemodynamic status that would indicate that the subject does not&#xD;
           have effective filling and ejection of the left ventricle to support a perfusing blood&#xD;
           pressure. This may manifest as hypotension and/or tachyarrhythmias on standard&#xD;
           intraoperative monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As this protocol evaluates the frequency and degree of air embolization into the systemic&#xD;
      venous system during the performance of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography&#xD;
      (ERCP), the following four subgroups have been identified to help define the identification&#xD;
      and treatment of subjects enrolled into IRB 238-11. Each category has a) criteria for the&#xD;
      visual quantification of the air seen and b) the cardiac function and hemodynamic changes&#xD;
      seen and finally c) the planned intervention if needed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. No air embolism:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. No visualized air emboli during the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Subjects have no hemodynamic or myocardial changes attributable to the occurrence&#xD;
                of venous air embolus.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. No changes would be made to the standard care of this research subject as a result&#xD;
                of the absence of findings. Findings will be entered into the research chart.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Small air embolism:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. A small, but identifiable quantity of air visualized that does not form a large&#xD;
                collection and does not obscure visualization of the far-field.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Subjects have no changes in myocardial function and maintenance of hemodynamics.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. The subject would then undergo follow-up evaluation by a member of the study group&#xD;
                at the conclusion of their normal post-op recovery period. No additional time would&#xD;
                be required for evaluation and documentation of hemodynamic stability and follow-up&#xD;
                echocardiography findings would be recorded in the research chart.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Moderate air embolism :&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Identifiable intracardiac air within the heart that obscures the far-field due to&#xD;
                its size but does not cause a sharp demarcation at the blood/gas interface.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Subjects have documented impairment of myocardial function and/or hemodynamics&#xD;
                compared to baseline but do not require emergency resuscitation to correct.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. The subject would remain in the left lateral decubitus (&quot;safe position&quot; for&#xD;
                individuals with suspected or confirmed venous air embolism) for four hours.&#xD;
                Laboratory tests including cardiac enzymes may be obtained and a member of the&#xD;
                study team will re-evaluate with transthoracic echocardiography. If baseline&#xD;
                function and hemodynamics return, the subject concludes their recovery period as&#xD;
                per normal circumstance for ERCP. In the event the subject has persistent&#xD;
                intracardiac air, impaired myocardial function or hemodynamic instability, it would&#xD;
                be recommended that the subject stay for observation with telemetry monitoring and&#xD;
                further evaluation as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Large air embolism:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Identifiable intracardiac air which collects into a large enough bubble to cause&#xD;
                sharp demarcation at the blood/gas interface and obscures the far-field.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Left and/or right ventricular failure with hemodynamic collapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. The subject would require emergency resuscitation and ACLS protocol in addition to&#xD;
                placement of invasive monitors for evaluation. Attempts to extract intracardiac air&#xD;
                using central venous catheter will be made and as needed intubation with transfer&#xD;
                to the ICU for further monitoring. Consultation for hyperbaric oxygen therapy would&#xD;
                be pursued and all measures would be taken to recover hemodynamic function.&#xD;
