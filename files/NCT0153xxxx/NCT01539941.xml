  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this proposal is to develop and pilot a brief protocol designed to systematically&#xD;
      integrate pharmacological interventions for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)&#xD;
      into behavioral treatment services for adolescent substance users with comorbid ADHD in&#xD;
      everyday care. ADHD is a prevalent co-occurring condition for adolescent substance use (ASU)&#xD;
      that can significantly impede successful ASU treatment but is vastly under-diagnosed and&#xD;
      undertreated among ASU clients in agency settings. Moreover, ADHD medication acceptance and&#xD;
      compliance is particularly difficult to achieve in high-risk adolescent populations.&#xD;

      The goal of this proposal is to develop and pilot a brief protocol designed to systematically&#xD;
      integrate pharmacological interventions for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)&#xD;
      into behavioral treatment services for adolescent substance users with comorbid ADHD in&#xD;
      everyday care. ADHD is a prevalent co-occurring condition for adolescent substance use (ASU)&#xD;
      that can significantly impede successful ASU treatment but is vastly under-diagnosed and&#xD;
      undertreated among ASU clients in agency settings. Moreover, ADHD medication acceptance and&#xD;
      compliance is particularly difficult to achieve in high-risk adolescent populations. The&#xD;
      proposed R21 study will use an interrupted time series design to test a brief protocol&#xD;
      designed to promote integration of evidence-based ADHD pharmacotherapy into routine&#xD;
      behavioral services for ASU: Medication Integration Protocol (MIP). MIP is a 5-session&#xD;
      family-based protocol delivered during the early portion of ASU treatment that contains three&#xD;
      research-based elements: (1) standardized psychiatric assessment and family-focused&#xD;
      psychoeducation about adolescent ADHD; (2) an approved ADHD medication regimen (OROS-MPH)&#xD;
      with demonstrated efficacy for ASU/ADHD clients; (3) family-based interventions to support&#xD;
      medication acceptance (as indicated) and coordination of care between psychiatric and&#xD;
      behavioral services. MIP will be integrated into existing family-based services at one&#xD;
      partnering clinical site: 20 ASU/ADHD cases will be treated by site family therapists who&#xD;
      will be newly trained and monitored in MIP. The partnering clinic provides family therapy as&#xD;
      the routine standard of care for outpatient behavioral health and offers on-site child&#xD;
      psychiatry services. Primary study aims will yield proof-of-concept data on MIP feasibility&#xD;
      and fidelity in usual care and evidence of MIP impact on psychiatric and behavioral services&#xD;
      utilization, medication acceptance and compliance, and satisfaction with treatment services.&#xD;
      Exploratory analyses will generate effect sizes for the short-term impact of MIP on the main&#xD;
      targets of ADHD medication: ADHD symptoms and executive cognitive functioning. New study&#xD;
      products would include a standardized and piloted MIP protocol, clinician training and&#xD;
      fidelity monitoring procedures, and an observational fidelity instrument. If validated, MIP&#xD;
      could be utilized as a stand-alone intervention in everyday care, or, be combined with&#xD;
      existing manualized treatments for ASU in an effort to develop fully integrated treatment&#xD;
      models for ASU/ADHD. Also, MIP could be delivered in conjunction with either family-based&#xD;
      treatments or individual treatments that can flexibly include caregivers in early sessions.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Ongoing; 3-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Brief qualitative interviews will be designed and administered to the on-site psychiatrist and family therapists to capture judgments about the viability and acceptability of MIP compared to previous site practices, as well as its perceived short- and long-term safety and effectiveness for ASU/ADHD cases. A parallel qualitative interview will be administered to teens and caregivers at 3-month follow-up. MIP teens will also receive incentives to maintain medication diaries of daily pill intake, using the NIDA CTN method.</description>

    <description>MIP is a 5 session protocol. The first session consists of pretreatment assessment activities using measures administered during routine clinical intake. The following sessions, MIP Sessions 1-4, are meant to be delivered sequentially, commencing sometime after session 2 or 3 of treatment, that is, after completion of initial treatment contracting and engagement interventions that will usually be focused on ASU-related referral problems for this population. The proposed pilot work will shed light on the optimal timing for MIP Sessions 1-4.</description>
