      This is a randomized, controlled, open-label clinical trial aimed to evaluate the Safety of&#xD;
      Kedbumin 25% Compared to Normal Saline Solution in the Treatment of Post-Surgical Hypovolemia&#xD;
      in Pediatric Patients Undergoing Major Elective Surgery. It will be conducted at&#xD;
      approximately 5 surgical and pediatric intensive care units (SICU/NICU/PICU) in the US, over&#xD;
      a period of 19 months, and the study population will consist of at least 60 male and female&#xD;
      pediatric subjects between 0 days and 12 years of age, undergoing cardiac, abdominal,&#xD;
      orthopedic or transplant surgery with an approximately equal number of subjects (n=10 to 25)&#xD;
      in three of the four age groups: (29 days to 23 months), (2 to 5 years 11 months) and (6&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, controlled, open-label clinical trial will be conducted at approximately 5&#xD;
      surgical and pediatric intensive care units in the US, over a period of 19 months, with 3&#xD;
      months for trial set-up, 12 months of simultaneous subject enrollment and 30 days of&#xD;
      treatment/follow-up period, and 3 months for study close-out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will consist of at least 60 male and female pediatric subjects between 0&#xD;
      days and 12 years of age, undergoing cardiac, abdominal, orthopedic or transplant surgery&#xD;
      with an approximately equal number of subjects (n=10 to 25) in three of the four age groups:&#xD;
      (29 days to 23 months), (2 to 5 years 11 months) and (6 years to 12 years) cohorts. Regarding&#xD;
      the youngest age group of 0 to 28 days, the minimum number of patients to be enrolled in the&#xD;
      study will not be predefined as very a small number of elective surgical procedures is&#xD;
      expected in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety concerns and eventual safety signals, as well as recruitment rate, will be monitored&#xD;
      annually (starting from the enrollment of the 60th subject) by an independent Safety&#xD;
      Monitoring Board (SMB), which will be appointed prior to study initiation and submitted to&#xD;
      the FDA. The responsibilities of the SMB will be defined in ad hoc document, in which the&#xD;
      threshold for acceptable safety will also be set. During the conduct of the study on the&#xD;
      first 60 patients, if there is any safety signal linked to the primary safety endpoint (i.e.&#xD;
      pulmonary fluid overload) or imbalance in the incidence of AEs between the treatment and&#xD;
      control groups or based on relevant literature, as judged by the SMB, the enrolment will be&#xD;
      increased to 100 patients using the same age stratification approach defined above (n=20 to&#xD;
      30 in each age group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential subjects will be pre-screened and informed consent/assent will be obtained from the&#xD;
      subject and/or subject's parents or guardians prior to surgery. Post-surgery, the subject&#xD;
      will be admitted to the Surgical, Neonatal, or Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (SICU/NICU/PICU)&#xD;
      for post-operative recovery and care management. Subjects who show signs of hypovolemia as&#xD;
      judged by the Principal Investigator (PI) will be screened to determine their eligibility to&#xD;
      participate in this trial. Subjects will then be randomized to receive treatment with&#xD;
      Kedbumin 25% or the comparator, normal saline (sodium chloride 0.9%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no specific post-treatment regimen for this protocol, as all subjects will receive&#xD;
      the standard post-operative care based on their clinical status and response to treatment at&#xD;
      the discretion of the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vital signs and fluid management/replacement therapy recorded in the medical chart and&#xD;
      results of standard complete blood count (CBC), biochemistry, and hematology and coagulation&#xD;
      lab panels will be reviewed and recorded by research staff at specified time points,&#xD;
      according to the hospital standard of care. Additionally, research staff will review and&#xD;
      record daily lactate, urine albumin, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and non-invasive&#xD;
      measurements at the following time points: Baseline, 6hr, 12hr, 24hr, 36hr, 48hr, and 72hr&#xD;
      post-onset of hypovolemia), until hemodynamic stability is achieved. Hemodynamic stability&#xD;
      will be evaluated based on site-specific age-defined reference ranges for heart rate, blood&#xD;
      pressure, urine output, and cardiac index in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The volume, rate and frequency of the Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP, either Kedbumin&#xD;
      25% or normal saline) administered will be recorded in addition to the type, timing, and&#xD;
      amount of all other fluids administered. The time to hemodynamic stability, duration of&#xD;
      stability once attained, and any relapse requiring additional treatment or use of secondary&#xD;
      resuscitation strategies will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who demonstrate hemodynamic stability within 3 days after treatment initiation and&#xD;
      then relapse into hemodynamic instability as a result of surgical complications or infection&#xD;
      will exit from the study, but the data be considered for the safety analysis. These subjects&#xD;
      should continue treatment according the clinical practice standard since the study is not&#xD;
      intended to evaluate the efficacy of Kedbumin 25%.&#xD;
