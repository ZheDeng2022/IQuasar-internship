  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As low back pain is often a recurrent and sometime persistent problem, research into&#xD;
      prevention is important. Chiropractors have traditionally treated patients with maintenance&#xD;
      care, which means that patients are seen on a regular basis to prevent recurrences or to stop&#xD;
      a persistent problem getting worse. However, it is not known if this has the expected effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will test the effectiveness of the maintenance care approach. Patients with&#xD;
      recurrent or persistent low back pain will be treated in accordance with two different&#xD;
      models. The first model is the maintenance care model, meaning that chiropractors will see&#xD;
      the patient on a regular basis, regardless symptoms. The other model means that patients&#xD;
      should be treated patients only when they themselves experience symptoms bad enough to seek&#xD;
      care. After one year, it will be possible to see if there has been any difference between the&#xD;
      groups in terms of pain, disability, quality of life and total number of treatments over the&#xD;
      study period and to investigate if there is any difference in the cost-effectiveness between&#xD;
      the two treatment models.Thus, the study hypothesis is that there is no difference between&#xD;
      the two models regarding the number of days with pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be a multi-centre trial, and as part of the study, it will be necessary to&#xD;
      formalize a network of research clinics all over Sweden in which participating chiropractors&#xD;
      accept to perform complex data collection. This network will then have the expertise and&#xD;
      potential to perform future clinical studies together with networks in other countries,&#xD;
      allowing large clinical trials across countries.&#xD;

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Patients with persistent or recurrent LBP were screened for eligibility in a stepwise manner (at Baseline 1, Baseline 2 and inclusion visit). The study started at the inclusion visit, when the initial treatment plan was completed when the clinician perceived that the patient's next visit could be scheduled with an interval of 1 month or longer, at which patients were randomly allocated to one of the treatment arms. Recruitment lasted from 2012 to 2016, in 40 Swedish chiropractic clinics.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Some individuals were lost in the inclusion process: At the 4th visit (baseline 2) a total of 616 subjects were screened for definite improvement, where 176 subjects were excluded from the trial. At the inclusion visit, 328 subjects were randomized into the trial, thus another 112 subjects were lost for unknown reasons.</pre_assignment_details>
