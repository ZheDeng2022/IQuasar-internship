  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this research is to compare the effect of a low dose Vasopressin infusion or&#xD;
      placebo during cardiopulmonary bypass on vasopressor requirements, hemodynamics and tissue&#xD;
      oxygen saturation and its recovery using tNIRS and vascular occlusion test (VOT) in elective&#xD;
      on pump cardiac surgery patients using a non-invasive near infrared spectrometry (NIRS)&#xD;
      machine. The clinical implications are that NIRS may permit earlier, non-invasive detection&#xD;
      of significant physiologic derangements and allow more accurate and timely titration of&#xD;
      medications, fluids and surgical intervention. The use of a low dose vasopressin seems to be&#xD;
      preventive for the incidence of observed post-cardiotomy vasodilatory shock and may improve&#xD;
      the function of microcirculation that will be assessed using VOT and tNIRS. Finally, it may&#xD;
      decrease both catecholamine dose and duration of their administration, it is considered as a&#xD;
      useful agent for decreasing all heir side-effects&#xD;

      In our double blind randomized study 40 patients undergoing cardiac surgery will be randomly&#xD;
      divided in two groups. The group A who will be infused with 2 IU/hr. vasopressin and the&#xD;
      group B who will be infused with normal saline (placebo) intraoperatively starting at the&#xD;
      time we give I.V. Heparin, throughout CPB and infusion will be ended when we give the&#xD;
      Protamine after coming off bypass. VOTs will be measured at the following time points:&#xD;
      Pre-induction of anesthesia, post-induction of anesthesia and at 30 minute intervals during&#xD;
      the cardiopulmonary bypass. And we will select cases that are expected to have a longer CPB&#xD;
      time such as Redo CABG, CABG + valve replacement, double valve replacement, Bentall procedure&#xD;
      and Mitral valve repair with mini thoracotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements of mean artery pressure (MAP), central venous pressure (CVP), ejection fracture&#xD;
      (EF), heart rate (HR), mean pulmonary artery pressure (MPAP), cardiac index (CI) will be&#xD;
      performed before, during, and after the operation. The requirements of catecholamine support&#xD;
      (eg. phenylephrine, epinephrine, vasopressin, norepinephrine, and dopamine) during CPB and&#xD;
      for first 24 hours postoperatively, urine-output, blood-loss, and the requirements in blood,&#xD;
      plasma and platelets for the first 24 hours will be included in the data collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the present study is to quantify the micro-oxygenation parameters in patients&#xD;
      undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB, to investigate the relationship of micro-oxygenation and&#xD;
      macro-perfusion parameters, to investigate the relationship of NIRS parameters and to&#xD;
      evaluate the association between micro-oxygenation parameters and outcome using VOT and&#xD;
      comparing the degree of falling of re-perfusion slope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that the administration of a low dose vasopressin will reduce both the&#xD;
      incidence and severity of vasoplegia and it will maintain the normal vasomotor reactivity&#xD;
      during cardiopulmonary bypass and this will reduce the total requirements of alpha-adrenergic&#xD;
      agonists specially Phenylephrine. That will reduce the risks of the use of high dose of&#xD;
      Phenylephrine and other inotropes, such as gut ischemia and end organ damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vascular Occlusion Test (VOT)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After the tissue oximetry probe is applied to the skin the oximeter machine records a&#xD;
           baseline value.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A pneumatic cuff (blood pressure cuff) is placed over the brachial artery of the same&#xD;
           arm above the elbow and inflated to 50 mmHg above systolic blood pressure. The cuff&#xD;
           remains inflated for 5 minutes. The oximeter machine is continuously recording StO2&#xD;
           values and other pertinent technical information such as quality of the signal and&#xD;
           events marked by the user.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After 5 minutes the cuff is quickly deflated and StO2 measurements continue to be&#xD;
           recorded until back to baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  VOTs will be measured at the following time points:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre-induction of anesthesia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post-induction of anesthesia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At 30 minute intervals during the cardiopulmonary bypass&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several measurements and calculations will be made from the recorded data:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline tissue oxygen saturation (StO2baseline) at time (t) = 0&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lowest StO2 reached after vascular occlusion (StO2nadir) and at what time&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Occlusion slope: defined as = (StO2baseline - StO2nadir/tbaseline - tnadir)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After cuff release, time at which baseline StO2 was reached (StO2recovery)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reperfusion slope: defined as = (StO2recovery - StO2nadir/trecovery - tnadir)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  âˆ†StO2: defined as = (StO2peak - StO2baseline)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Peak StO2 reached after cuff release and at what time&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements of mean artery pressure (MAP), central venous pressure (CVP), ejection fracture&#xD;
      (EF), heart rate (HR), mean pulmonary artery pressure (MPAP), cardiac index (CI) will be&#xD;
      performed before, during, and after the operation. The requirements of catecholamine support&#xD;
      (eg. phenylephrine, epinephrine, vasopressin, norepinephrine, dopamine) during CPB and for&#xD;
      first 24 hours postoperatively, urine-output, blood-loss, and the requirements in blood,&#xD;
      plasma and platelets for the first 24 hours will be included in the data collected.&#xD;
