      Study Proposal:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other drugs where synergy with Gemcitabine has been observed are Cisplatinum, Taxol,&#xD;
      Taxotere, Etoposide and alkylating agents. However in view of Oxaliplatin's superior activity&#xD;
      as a single agent against lymphoma, the combination of Gemcitabine with Oxaliplatin is more&#xD;
      attractive and should be explored in this group of disorders. Based on these data and&#xD;
      considering the advantage of its favorable toxicity profile, we propose a phase II study in&#xD;
      patients with either refractory or relapsing aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphomas including&#xD;
      peripheral T-cell lymphomas which are known to have a poor outcome when compared with&#xD;
      equivalent aggressive B-cell lymphomas.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with refractory or relapsed aggressive non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma. The definition&#xD;
             of refractory includes patients who either did not respond to prior therapy or those&#xD;
             whose best response was a PR after at least 4 courses of chemotherapy. Aggressive&#xD;
             histologies include follicular large cell, diffuse large cell, peripheral T cell,&#xD;
             transformed lymphomas, Lymphoblastic lymphomas, Burkitt and Burkitt like lymphomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologic or cytological confirmation of refractory or relapsed aggressive&#xD;
             non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma is desirable but not mandatory and will be left to the&#xD;
             discretion of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have measurable or evaluable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No more than 4 previous regimens of chemotherapy will be allowed, including stem cell&#xD;
             or bone marrow transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be more than 18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No evidence of grade 3 or more neurosensory or neuromotor dysfunction (see appendix-&#xD;
             toxicity criteria)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Written Consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Those patients who have previously received a platinum or nucleoside&#xD;
             analogue-containing regimen are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are candidates for stem cell or marrow transplant will be included&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a previous or concurrent history of cancer with the exception of:&#xD;
             1-treated carcinoma in situ of cervix or breast. 2- treated squamous or basal cell&#xD;
             skin cancer, or 3- any other surgically cured malignancy from which the patient has&#xD;
             been disease free for at least 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV positive patients and those with Hepatitis B or C will be excluded from this&#xD;
             protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with severe neuropathy will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chemotherapy or Radiotherapy within the previous 3 weeks prior to entering study.&#xD;
