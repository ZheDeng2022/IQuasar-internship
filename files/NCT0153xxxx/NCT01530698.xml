      Objectives: This is an exploratory study, consisting of two parts. In part I dose escalation&#xD;
      is performed and the primary objective is the safety of different doses of TLR-DC and Trimix&#xD;
      DC. In part II Trimix DC vaccination will be compared with TLR-DC vaccination and the primary&#xD;
      objective of this part is the immunological response, with toxicity and clinical efficacy&#xD;
      being secondary objectives. These studies will provide important data on the safety and&#xD;
      immunological effects of TLR-DC and Trimix DC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Part I of this study is an open label dose escalation study. Part II of this&#xD;
      study is an open label randomized phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Our study population consists of melanoma patients, with proven expression&#xD;
      of melanoma associated tumor antigens gp100 and tyrosinase. Melanoma patients with regional&#xD;
      lymph node metastasis in whom a radical lymph node dissection is performed within 2 months of&#xD;
      inclusion in this study (further referred to as stage III) and melanoma patients with&#xD;
      measurable distant metastases (further referred to as stage IV) will be included.&#xD;

      1. Rationale Immunotherapy applying ex vivo generated and tumor-antigen-loaded dendritic&#xD;
           cells (DC) has now successfully been introduced in the clinic. A limited, but&#xD;
           consistent, number of objective immunological and clinical responses have been observed.&#xD;
           Thusfar it remains unclear why some patients respond and others not, but there is a&#xD;
           general consensus that the current protocols applied to generate DC may not result in&#xD;
           the induction of optimal Th1 responses. The investigators and others have demonstrated&#xD;
           that DC maturation is one of the crucial factors, not only for effective DC migration&#xD;
           but also to induce effective anti-tumor immune responses in cancer patients. Currently,&#xD;
           the &quot;golden standard&quot; used to mature DC consists of a cocktail of pro-inflammatory&#xD;
           cytokines (IL-1b, IL-6, TNFa) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Recent mouse data&#xD;
           demonstrated, however, that maturation of DC by solely pro-inflammatory cytokines&#xD;
           yielded DC that supported T cell clonal expansion, but failed to efficiently direct&#xD;
           effector T cell differentiation. Interestingly, DC matured in the presence of Toll like&#xD;
           receptor (TLR) ligands were able to induce full T cell effector function and unleashed&#xD;
           more potent immune responses. The investigators recently identified vaccines against&#xD;
           infectious diseases that contain TLR ligands and are capable of inducing DC maturation.&#xD;
           This knowledge provides a new application for these clinical applicable agents: clinical&#xD;
           grade DC stimulators. A clinical grade DC maturation protocol is developed in which TLR&#xD;
           ligands (preventive vaccines) and PGE2 are combined which resulted in the generation of&#xD;
           mature DC that secrete high levels of the key cytokine IL-12. Moreover, these TLR-ligand&#xD;
           matured DC (TLR-DC) induced T cells secreting at least 20-fold higher levels of the&#xD;
           effector cytokines IFNa and TNFa as compared to DC matured in the absence of TLR&#xD;
           ligands.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In the group of Kris Thielemans and it was shown that the T-cell stimulatory capacity of&#xD;
           peptide-pulsed DC can be greatly enhanced by providing them with three different&#xD;
           molecular adjuvants through electroporation with mRNA encoding a so-called TriMix of&#xD;
           CD40 ligand (CD40L), CD70, and a constitutively active form of TLR4 (caTLR4). The&#xD;
           combination of CD40L and caTLR4 electroporation would mimic CD40 ligation and TLR4&#xD;
           signaling of the DC and generates phenotypically mature, cytokine/chemokine-secreting&#xD;
           DC, as has been shown for CD40 and TLR4 ligation through addition of soluble CD40L and&#xD;
           lipopolysaccharide. On the other hand, the introduction of CD70 into the DC would&#xD;
           provide a costimulatory signal to CD27+ naive T cells by inhibiting activated T cell&#xD;
           apoptosis and by supporting T cell proliferation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In conclusion, these in vitro data demonstrate that both TLR-DC and Trimix DC are&#xD;
           promising candidates to improve immunological and clinical responses in cancer&#xD;
           immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Objectives This is an exploratory study, consisting of two parts. In part I dose&#xD;
           escalation is performed and the primary objective is the safety of different doses of&#xD;
           TLR-DC and Trimix DC. In part II Trimix DC vaccination will be compared with TLR-DC&#xD;
           vaccination and the primary objective of this part is the immunological response, with&#xD;
           toxicity and clinical efficacy being secondary objectives. These studies will provide&#xD;
           important data on the safety and immunological effects of TLR-DC and Trimix DC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study design Part I of this study is an open label dose escalation study. Part II of&#xD;
           this study is an open label randomized phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Study population Our study population consists of melanoma patients, with proven&#xD;
           expression of melanoma associated tumor antigens gp100 and tyrosinase. Melanoma patients&#xD;
           with regional lymph node metastasis in whom a radical lymph node dissection is performed&#xD;
           within 2 months of inclusion in this study (further referred to as stage III) and&#xD;
           melanoma patients with measurable distant metastases (further referred to as stage IV)&#xD;
           will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Main study endpoints The primary objectives of the study are to investigate the toxicity&#xD;
           of TLR-DC and Trimix DC by dose escalation of DC numbers in part I, and to investigate&#xD;
           immunological responses upon DC vaccination in part II of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunological responses are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The activation of immune cells in vivo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The immunological response induced with TLR-DC and Trimix DC loaded with mRNA encoding&#xD;
           melanoma-associated tumor antigens (gp100 and tyrosinase).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety and clinical efficacy are secondary objectives.&#xD;
