      Subjects Twenty eight apparently healthy women, fourteen of them with a ultrasonographic&#xD;
      homogeneous echo(group 1) and other fourteen with a &quot; triple-line&quot;(group 2) endometrium in&#xD;
      the late follicle phase, were involved in our Department for the study between September 2010&#xD;
      and November 2011. The included criteria for both groups of women were ≤40 years of age, with&#xD;
      a regular menstrual cycles (25-35 days), without use of an intrauterine devices or oral&#xD;
      contraceptive at least 3 months before the study. Exclusion criteria were women with&#xD;
      polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), endometriosis, premature ovarian failure (POF) and an&#xD;
      abortion within 1 year or a history of pelvic inflammatory disease. The mean age of the women&#xD;
      were 31.9±3.7 years ( range, 26-39 years). The mean body mass index was 20.96±2.46 kg/m2&#xD;
      (range, 17.58-26.04 kg/m2).With a regular menstrual cycle (25-35days) and 2-11 years&#xD;
      infertile history, all subjects had signed the proper consent forms. The study was approved&#xD;
      by our Institutional Ethics committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ovulation monitoring The women were followed for one cycle by obtaining blood samples and&#xD;
      urine samples. The ovulation was monitored with vaginal ultrasonography (aloka-1000, UST-985,&#xD;
      5 MHz transvaginal probe, aloka Co. Ltd, Tokyo, Japan). The thickness of two endometrial&#xD;
      layers was measured. The endometrial pattern was assessed according to the classification&#xD;
      proposed by Gonen and Casper as follows: an endometrium that was entirely homogeneously&#xD;
      hyperechoic without a central echogenic line was considered as a homogeneous echo pattern and&#xD;
      triple-line pattern consisted of a central hyperechoic line surrounded by two hypoechoic&#xD;
      layers. The growth of follicles, ovulation and the development of corpus luteum were&#xD;
      monitored by using two-plane scans. Participants identified the day of the LH surge by&#xD;
      testing the morning urine (David ovulation test, Rubio Biotech Co. Ltd., Shantou, China). The&#xD;
      day of the LH surge was determined in urine samples when LH surge reached its highest value&#xD;
      on which the blood samples were collected as well. The cycle day referred to the first day of&#xD;
      menstrual bleeding. Women who have normal ovulatory cycles with intervals of 25-35 days are&#xD;
      expected to ovulate on day 11 at the earliest and day 21at the latest. The peripheral blood&#xD;
      samples were obtained by vein puncture on the day of the LH surge and 6-7 days after&#xD;
      ovulation. Blood was separated by centrifugation within 1 hour, and the serum was stored at&#xD;
      -20℃ until the concentrations of LH, FSH, estradiol (E2) and progesterone were assayed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endometrial biopsy Two endometrial biopsies were performed during a single menstrual cycle in&#xD;
      each subject. The early biopsy was performed on the pre-ovulatory day (late follicle phase)&#xD;
      and the endometrial tissues were collected from the anterior wall of the uterine cavity.&#xD;
      Whereas the late biopsy was performed on ovulation day +7 (midluteal phase or implantation&#xD;
      widow phase), and the endometrial sample was collected from the posterior wall of the uterine&#xD;
      cavity with or without dilatation of the cervix by using an endometrial curette (#4164&#xD;
      prebet, Genetics, pommel, Belgium). Each sample was divided into three pieces and immediately&#xD;
      fixed. Samples for scanning electron microscopy for fixed in a solution containing 2.5%&#xD;
      (wt/vol) glutaraldehyde, 0.5% paraformaldehyde, 0.1 mol/L of sucrose, 0.1 mol/L of&#xD;
      sodiumcacodylate, and 3 mmol/L of calciumchloride (pH, 7.4). Samples for immunohistochemistry&#xD;
      were fixed in 4% formalin . Samples for transmission electron microscopy was fixed by 2.5%&#xD;
      glutaraldehyde arsenate ;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scanning electron microscopy Samples were washed twice in a buffer containing 0.15 mol/L of&#xD;
      sodiumcacodylate and 3 mmol/L of calcium chloride (PH, 7.4) and once in distilled water. The&#xD;
      specimens were dehydrated first in increasing concentrations of ethanol (70%,95%,and 99.5%)&#xD;
      and then in acetone; they were dried in a critical-point dryer by using carbon dioxide. The&#xD;
      specimens were mounted, coated with platinum, and examined by using a scanning electron&#xD;
      microscope ( S-3000N, Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). The developmental phase of the pinopode were&#xD;
      classified. Because the pinopodes on the endometrial surface do not develop at exactly the&#xD;
      same time the pinopodes were not evenly distributed over the endometrial surface, thus, in&#xD;
      our study, we examined five fields each biopsy sample and analyzed the development and&#xD;
      distribution of pinopodes. The morphology evaluation was defined as: no pinopodes,developing&#xD;
      pinopodes,fully developed pinopodes and regressing pinopodes. The semi-quantitative&#xD;
      evaluation was defined as following:- (0%), + (﹤20%), ++ (20-50%) and +++(&gt;50%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunohistochemistry 56 biopsy samples of 28 patients were used for immunohistochemical&#xD;
      analysis. For LIF, integrin αv, VEGF and MMP-9 studies 4 um paraffin-embedded sections were&#xD;
      deparaffinized 20 min in acetone at 70℃. Endogenous peroxidase was blocked with 3% H2O2 for&#xD;
      10 min. Antigen retrieval was boiling by heating for 5 min in 0.01 M citrate buffer at pH&#xD;
      6.0,and then the sections were incubated overnight at 4℃ with the specific antibodies which&#xD;
      were diluted at 1:50. The antibodies used in this study were polyclonal antibodies (PAB) LIF,&#xD;
      integrin αv, VEGF and MMP-9 (BA 1239, BA0957,BA0407 and BA0573, Booster Co Ltd, Wuhan,&#xD;
      China). The sections were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), blocked with 10% normal&#xD;
      goat serum for 30 min and then incubated with goat anti-rabbit biotinylated immunoglobulins&#xD;
      (IgG)(SV0002, Booster Co Ltd, Wuhan, China) at 37℃ for 30 min. For integrin β3 study, the&#xD;
      sections were incubated with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 min after hot repair of antigen by&#xD;
      boiling at 95℃ of 0.01M citrate buffer(pH6.0), then incubated with polyclonal antibodies&#xD;
      integrin β3 (sc-6626, santa, USA) diluted at 1:100 overnight at 4℃. Polymer Helper (PV-9003,&#xD;
      Zhong-Shang Co Ltd, Beijing, China) was added at room temperature and with a interval of 20&#xD;
      min, Poly Peroxidase-anti-goat IgG (PV-9003, Zhong-Shang Co Ltd, Beijing, China) was added.&#xD;
      The slides were then washed in PBS and colored by 3,3-diaminobenzidine in H2O2 (DAB,&#xD;
      vitrogen, California, USA). The sections were finally washed in water. In every case a&#xD;
      negative control was performed by omission of incubation with the primary specific antibody.&#xD;
      The reactivity of each polyclonal antibody with endometrial glands and surface epithelium,&#xD;
      stromal cells was assessed. Staining was evaluated semiquantitatively by using a grading&#xD;
      system. Staining intensity and the number of stained cells were graded on a scale of 0=no&#xD;
      staining, +/- = few stained cells, + = faint staining, ++ = moderate staining, and +++ =&#xD;
      strong staining. The formula of H-score=ΣPi(i+1) was used to calculation. One observer who&#xD;
      was blinded to identify of the slides performed all the assessments. After completion of the&#xD;
      study, the same observer reexamined the slides to ensure reproducibility of the&#xD;
      semiquantitative assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transmission electron microscopy Specimens for transmission electron microscopy were fixed in&#xD;
      2.5% glutaraldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4) and post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide. After dehydration&#xD;
      in a graded ethanol series, specimens were placed in propylene oxide and embedded in Epon,&#xD;
      stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined in transmission electron microscope&#xD;
      .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis The Statistics Package for Social Science (SPSS 13.0; SPSS Inc.,&#xD;
      Chicago, IL) was used for statistical analyses. The mean±S.D was evaluated using analysis of&#xD;
      student's t-test ,ranked data was analyzed with the Rank Sum Test (Mann-Whitney test) and&#xD;
      qualitative data was analyzed with chi-square test . Statistical significance was set at&#xD;
      P&lt;0.05(two tailed).&#xD;
