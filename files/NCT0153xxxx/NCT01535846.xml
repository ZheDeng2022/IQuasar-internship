  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Energy-restricted diets often require dieting rules, which forced the dieter to eat according&#xD;
      to cognitive norms, which increase his vulnerability to external food cues. Allowing the&#xD;
      recognition of internal hunger and satiety cues by using conscious food tasting could be&#xD;
      helpful among restrained eaters to facilitate an internalized regulation of food intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of the proposed study are to investigate among restrained women whether&#xD;
      conscious food tasting can influence 1) attitudes and behaviors associated with food and&#xD;
      eating; 2) reliance on hunger and satiety signals; and 3) development of taste and olfactory&#xD;
      memory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Females (n=50) will be randomly assigned to: 1) experimental group (conscious food tasting&#xD;
      intervention) (n=24), or 2) control group (n=26). The conscious food tasting intervention&#xD;
      will be conducted by a registered dietitian into groups of ten to twelve women during six&#xD;
      weekly 2-hour workshops. Women in the control group will not receive any intervention.&#xD;
      Measurements will be taken at baseline, at the end of the intervention period, and at 12-week&#xD;
      post-intervention. Restraint Scale, Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire, Mindful Eating&#xD;
      Questionnaire, Intuitive Eating Scale, Body-Esteem Scale and Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale will&#xD;
      measure attitudes and behaviors associated with food and eating as well as some aspects&#xD;
      related to psychological functioning. The Intuitive Eating Scale and a snack-meal taste&#xD;
      rating task (visual analogue scales) will assess internal hunger/satiety cues. Vocabulary&#xD;
      used to describe the foods will be recorded from the snack-meal taste rating task and use to&#xD;
      assess taste and olfactory memory. Sensory capabilities will be assessed by odour detection&#xD;
      and identification test, and a taste detection test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will provide a better understanding of the effects of conscious food&#xD;
      tasting on eating attitudes and behaviors, which is relevant to dietetic practice as it could&#xD;
      help to promote sustainable healthy eating habits.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In the experimental group (n=24), the conscious food tasting intervention will be conducted&#xD;
      by a registered dietitian into small groups of ten to twelve women during six weekly 2-hour&#xD;
      workshops. Workshops will be taking place in a well-ventilated room to insure that there are&#xD;
      no extraneous odours or noises that may hamper the activities involving senses. To enhance&#xD;
      feeling of belonging to the group as well as the confidence within each participant, time&#xD;
      will be allowed for participants' introduction at the beginning of the first workshop.&#xD;
      Specific themes will be addressed during each of the six workshops. During the first and&#xD;
      second workshops, theoretical notions about weight management and energy-restricted diets,&#xD;
      restrained eating versus intuitive and mindful eating, appetite sensations, sensory-specific&#xD;
      satiety and weight-related issues will be presented by the registered dietitian. The&#xD;
      presentation will be interactive, so that discussion and questions will be foster throughout&#xD;
      the workshops. From the third workshop, basic knowledge and activities related to sensory&#xD;
      food perceptions will be introduced. Prior to food tasting activities, participants will be&#xD;
      advised to avoid drinking coffee or eating chocolate and any other foods with a strong or&#xD;
      persistent taste, and to avoid wearing perfumes, scented lotions and creams as all these&#xD;
      conditions could affect sensory perceptions. During the third workshop, theoretical notions&#xD;
      about taste qualities (sweet, salt, sour, bitter) will be firstly addressed. A taste activity&#xD;
      will then be done using aqueous solutions containing different concentrations of a taste&#xD;
      compound. The objective of this activity will be to let participants experience their own&#xD;
      taste sensitivity level so that they can identify at which concentration level they can&#xD;
      detect different tastes. During the fourth and fifth workshop, theoretical and practical&#xD;
      notions about food tasting techniques will be addressed. The various roles played by other&#xD;
      senses (i.e., sight, hearing, touch, smell) during food tasting will also be experienced by&#xD;
      the participants using practical activities. For that purpose, various foods will be used&#xD;
      such as herbs and spices, cheeses, fruits, chocolate and chips. In addition, one of the most&#xD;
      difficult aspects of tasting evaluation is to find the right words that well-described food&#xD;
      perception. Each participant will thus be guided by the registered dietitian and discuss&#xD;
      about some of the terminology of tasting in order to find out appropriate terms they could be&#xD;
      used to describe the tasted foods. A list of these descriptive words will then be created, so&#xD;
      that they can have their own list of reference. At the end of each food tasting activities, a&#xD;
      discussion will be led by the registered dietitian about appetite sensations, emotions and&#xD;
      recollection of memories associated with the tasted foods. As enjoying eating involve more&#xD;
      than sensory stimulation from the foods, the last workshop will discuss the cognitive, social&#xD;
      and emotional aspects related to tasting and pleasure while eating (e.g. dichotomized&#xD;
      thinking about healthy eating, eating with family and friends, and affective processes in&#xD;
      eating behaviors) in order to integrate these eating-related aspect to a peaceful&#xD;
      relationship with foods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the waiting-list control group (n=26), women will be instructed to follow their usual&#xD;
      lifestyle habits for the duration of the study. Over the study period, these women will not&#xD;
      receive any form of contact from the research team, with the exception of post treatment&#xD;
      testing sessions (T=2 and T=3), as performed in the experimental group. To control for&#xD;
      potential confounding effects of other treatments, the investigators will ask to women from&#xD;
      the waiting-list control group to report all consultations with health professionals and/or&#xD;
      any forms of intervention that they received during the course of the study. After the final&#xD;
      testing session at 12-week post-intervention (T=3), women from the control group will be&#xD;
      invited to participate in the conscious food tasting intervention on a voluntary basis.&#xD;
