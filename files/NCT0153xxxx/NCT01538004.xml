  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of automated blood pressure measurement (ABPM) devices in the office setting is&#xD;
      increasingly recognized as superior to manual BP measurement. Current guidelines recommend&#xD;
      that patients be alone in a quiet room, with no interactions with health care professionals&#xD;
      during the readings; in practice, this means using an exam room. However, we found no&#xD;
      evidence supporting the location of ABPM. Furthermore, exam rooms are constantly being used&#xD;
      in primary care offices, so this may not be practical in routine care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study, fifty consecutive consenting patients age 18 or more in each of seven&#xD;
      community based primary care offices will randomly be allocated to either ABPM in an exam&#xD;
      room, or in a non-private area of the clinic. After being tested in the first location they&#xD;
      will then be tested in the second location with the same device. The main outcome will be the&#xD;
      mean value of the last five systolic blood pressures for each location within offices.&#xD;
      Secondary measures will include blood pressures for patients with or without hypertension, a&#xD;
      comparison of the initial and second set of blood pressures and of the effect of office noise&#xD;
      in decibels on BP readings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New technology is more readily adopted if barriers to use are minimized. If we find no&#xD;
      differences in BP readings between office locations, clinicians will then have the option to&#xD;
      use an additional office area to implement the automated BP measurement device.&#xD;

      Following the design of our pilot study, patients consenting to two sets of blood pressure&#xD;
      readings will be randomly allocated using a random number table to either automated blood&#xD;
      pressure measurement using a BpTRU device in an exam room (private area without any traffic&#xD;
      or staff) with the door closed, or BpTRU in an open (non-private area) of the clinic with&#xD;
      routine office traffic and noise levels. Patients randomized to the private area first will&#xD;
      be subsequently tested in the non-private area and those randomized to the non-private area&#xD;
      first will then be tested in the private area. A single portable BpTRU machine will be used&#xD;
      for all recordings. A research assistant will be trained on the use of the equipment with at&#xD;
      least five supervised training readings. The BpTRU device will be placed on the patient's arm&#xD;
      and readings will be recorded by the research assistant. The first reading will be done with&#xD;
      the research assistant present to ensure proper placement and recording. The patient will&#xD;
      then be left alone for the subsequent five measurements separated by one minute intervals.&#xD;
      This will be immediately followed by a second set of readings in the alternate location.&#xD;
      During both sets of readings the patient will be seated comfortably in a chair with arms and&#xD;
      will be instructed not to talk or cross their legs. The same arm will be used for both sets&#xD;
      of measurements with the blood pressure cuff at heart level. The research assistant will&#xD;
      record the average of the last five out of six blood pressure readings for each office&#xD;
      location, in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations and previous studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research assistant will record decibel levels in each location during BP readings using a&#xD;
      Reed Sound Level Meter C-322 (Reed Instruments, Ste-Anne-de-Bellevue, Quebec, Canada). The&#xD;
      sound level meter includes a data logger, and the mean decibel level per location for each&#xD;
      set of readings will be recorded. The assistant will be trained in the use of the sound meter&#xD;
      and logger and will use it during the five supervised BP training readings. The research&#xD;
      assistant will also measure and record the patient's weight in kg, height in cm, and will&#xD;
      collect information on patient's gender and self reported history of hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned sample size and analysis Our sample size is based on equivalence of BpTRU measurement&#xD;
      done in non private office areas as compared to measurement done in private office areas,&#xD;
      using the results of our pilot study. We consider differences of less than 5 mm Hg in&#xD;
      systolic blood pressure to be clinically equivalent. In order to demonstrate equivalence for&#xD;
      our primary outcome, and accounting for clustering effect in primary care offices, using a&#xD;
      power of 80% and a two sided alpha level of 0.05 to conclude equivalency for a difference of&#xD;
      5 mm Hg or less, we will need to recruit 350 patients. Our planned recruitment is therefore&#xD;
      fifty patients per office and seven office locations. 175 patients (25 per office location)&#xD;
      will be randomly allocated to BpTRU measurement in a private exam room first and 175 will be&#xD;
      allocated to an open area first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the analytic methods used in our pilot study, we will use a random effect&#xD;
      regression model to account for repeated measures within each participant for analyzing the&#xD;
      data. Regression analysis will be undertaken to compare the measures and results will be&#xD;
      adjusted for clustering effect. All tests will be two-sided using an alpha level of 0.05.&#xD;
