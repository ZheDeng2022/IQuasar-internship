  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effects of Lacosamide, an antiepileptic drug, on sleep have not been formally evaluated.&#xD;
      The present study is being conducted to assess the effects of Lacosamide on sleep quality in&#xD;
      healthy subjects.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In some patients with Epilepsy, seizure activity is associated with specific phases of&#xD;
      sleep/wake cycle, and sleep deprivation is known to precipitate seizure activity. Inadequate&#xD;
      or disturbed sleep and excessive daytime drowsiness is often reported by patients with&#xD;
      Epilepsy due to the effects of seizures as well as antiepileptic drugs. Thus, the use of&#xD;
      healthy subjects improves the certainty that any changes in sleep are related to the study&#xD;
      drug and not other factors.&#xD;

    <description>Lacosamide will be given orally in 50 mg tablets twice a day for 7 days. The dose will increase weekly by 100 mg per day to a target dose of 300 mg per day. Once the target dose of 300 mg per day has been achieved for 9 days, a 2-day tapering of Lacosamide will occur by 100 mg per day.</description>
