    <textblock>
      The non-invasive assessment of liver fibrosis in chronic viral hepatitis B and C is now&#xD;
      entering clinical practice. It is based on blood tests, especially FibroMetre® and Fibrotest®&#xD;
      and on elastography with the Fibroscan®. Despite the overall satisfactory diagnostic&#xD;
      performance for all of these tests (AUROC ranging from 0.80 to 0.90 depending on the study)&#xD;
      for the discrimination of F≤1 versus F≥2, the positive and negative predictive values ,&#xD;
      however, are far from be perfect in a given patient. With these technique, failures are also&#xD;
      possible and the measures do not meet quality standards that increase the risk of&#xD;
      misclassification. It would be particularly useful to have new generation techniques with a&#xD;
      better diagnostic performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this project, in response to the problems presented above, we propose to evaluate the&#xD;
      diagnostic performance of five innovative ultrasonic techniques for the non-invasive&#xD;
      diagnosis of fibrosis.&#xD;
