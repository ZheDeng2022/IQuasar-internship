      The purpose of this study is first to evaluate absolute myocardial blood flow and resistance&#xD;
      over time in the acute and sub-acute phase of myocardial infarction and second, to correlate&#xD;
      these parameters to preservation of left ventricular function and long-term outcome.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In acute myocardial infarction, early restoration of epicardial and myocardial blood flow is&#xD;
      of paramount importance to limit infarct size and create optimum conditions for favorable&#xD;
      long-term outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Presently, restoration of epicardial blood flow is preferably obtained by primary&#xD;
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI). PPCI is the treatment of choice for patients with&#xD;
      acute myocardial infarction who can be admitted sufficiently fast to a hospital equipped for&#xD;
      this type for treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Successful restoration of epicardial blood flow by PPCI is possible in approximately 90% of&#xD;
      all patients. Nevertheless, in a number of these patients myocardial hypoperfusion persists&#xD;
      due to moderate or severe microvascular dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The terminology &quot;no reflow&quot; is often used for this condition. Microvascular thromboembolism,&#xD;
      spasm, or intramyocardial oedema are suggested to be responsible for this condition and&#xD;
      probably all of these three phenomena play a role. Besides that, inflammatory response of the&#xD;
      myocardium can be involved with neutrophil plugging of the capillaries, further compromising&#xD;
      restoration of normal myocardial blood flow and function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is well known that in patients in whom myocardial reperfusion is absent or limited,&#xD;
      despite adequate epicardial reperfusion, prognosis is poor and more severe left ventricular&#xD;
      dysfunction can be expected in comparison to those patients in whom also microvascular&#xD;
      reperfusion after PPCI is restored. Therefore, it is beyond doubt that knowledge about the&#xD;
      actual state of the microvasculature and myocardial (re)perfusion shortly after PPCI, is&#xD;
      important from a prognostic point of view.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, if microvascular reperfusion is still limited immediately after myocardial&#xD;
      infarction, but recovers quickly in the days thereafter, this might have important&#xD;
      implications for long-term prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lastly, knowledge about microvascular reperfusion in the acute phase can be important with&#xD;
      respect to choice of adjunct mechanical or medical therapy, such as intra aortic balloon&#xD;
      pumping (IABP), Gp IIb/IIIa inhibitors or continuation of nitroglycerine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite this undisputed importance of microvascular perfusion and function in the acute phase&#xD;
      of myocardial infarction, its assessment has been difficult so far and has been hampered by a&#xD;
      number of methodological and technical shortcomings.It should be realized in this context&#xD;
      that the function of the microvasculature in general (and specifically in acute myocardial&#xD;
      infarction) can be characterized by myocardial blood flow and resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, the investigators have developed a new technique for measuring absolute coronary&#xD;
      and myocardial blood flow and absolute and relative coronary and myocardial resistance This&#xD;
      has paved the way to study microvascular function in acute myocardial infarction immediately&#xD;
      after epicardial reperfusion by PPCI and in the days thereafter.&#xD;
