    <textblock>
      This pilot phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of giving viral therapy&#xD;
      to patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Viral therapy, such as wild-type&#xD;
      reovirus, may be able to kill cancer cells without damaging normal cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine safety and tolerability of Reolysin in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Obtain evidence of Reovirus replication by immunohistochemical co-localization of&#xD;
      Reovirus and tubulin staining in marrow clot sections obtained on cycle 1 day 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Obtain preliminary data on response as determined by International Myeloma Working Group&#xD;
      criteria after infusion of Reolysin as a single agent. (Clinical) II. Obtain pilot overall&#xD;
      and progression free survival data for all treated patients. (Clinical) III. Assess&#xD;
      neutralizing anti-reovirus assay (NARA) results on days 1, 8, 15, and once days 22-28 during&#xD;
      cycle 1. (Correlative) IV. Assess feasibility of staining for RAF/MEK/ERK in CD138+ cells&#xD;
      using marrow clot sections obtained from pre-treatment specimen. (Correlative) V.&#xD;
      Cryopreserve PBMCs for future ancillary studies focused initially on lymphocyte subset(s) and&#xD;
      myeloid derived suppressor cell changes after Reolysin infusion during cycle 1. (Correlative)&#xD;
      VI. Cryopreserve CD138+-selected cells at screening and after treatment for future ancillary&#xD;
      studies of genetic and epigenetic changes focused in part on endoplasmic reticulum (ER)&#xD;
      stress. (Correlative)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive wild-type reovirus IV over 60 minutes on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every&#xD;
      28 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo bone marrow aspirate at baseline and periodically during study for&#xD;
      RAF/MEK/ERK expression and wild-type reovirus replication analysis by immunohistochemistry.&#xD;
      Blood and cryopreserved CD138+ selected cell samples are also collected for future ancillary&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.&#xD;
