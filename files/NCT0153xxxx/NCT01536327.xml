    <textblock>
      Metachromatic Leukodystrophy Disease (MLD) is one of a group of genetic disorders called the&#xD;
      leukodystrophies. These diseases impair the growth or development of the myelin sheath, the&#xD;
      fatty covering that acts as an insulator around nerve fibers. Myelin, which lends its colour&#xD;
      to the white matter of the brain, is a complex substance made up of varying lipids (75%) and&#xD;
      proteins (25%). The leukodystrophies are caused by genetic defects in myelin production or&#xD;
      metabolization of the compounds of the myelin sheath. Each of the leukodystrophies is the&#xD;
      result of a defect in the gene that controls one (and only one) of the enzymes responsible&#xD;
      for creating or degrading a part of the myelin. MLD is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme&#xD;
      arylsulfatase A. MLD is one of several lipid storage diseases, which results in the toxic&#xD;
      build-up of fatty materials (lipids) in cells in the nervous system, liver, and kidneys.&#xD;
      There are three forms of MLD: late infantile, juvenile, and adult. Onset of the late&#xD;
      infantile form (the most common MLD) is typically between 12 and 20 months following birth.&#xD;
      Affected children have difficulty walking after the first year of life. Symptoms include&#xD;
      muscle wasting and weakness, muscle rigidity, developmental delays, progressive loss of&#xD;
      vision leading to blindness, convulsions, impaired swallowing, paralysis, and dementia.&#xD;
      Children may become comatose. Most children with this form of MLD die by age 5. The juvenile&#xD;
      form of MLD (between 3-10 years of age) usually begins with impaired school performance,&#xD;
      mental deterioration, and dementia and then develop symptoms similar to the infantile form&#xD;
      but with slower progression. The adult form commonly begins after age 16 as a psychiatric&#xD;
      dis-order or progressive dementia. Symptoms include impaired concentration, ataxia, seizures,&#xD;
      dementia, and tremor. Due to consanguinity autosomalrecessive disorders such as MLD have&#xD;
      higher prevalence in Arabian countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New methods, like mass-spectrometry give a good chance to characterize specific metabolic&#xD;
      alterations in the blood (plasma) of affected patients that allow to diagnose in the future&#xD;
      the disease earlier, with a higher sensitivity and specificity. In a pilotstudy&#xD;
      glycosylsphingosin-sulfatid has been determined as a sensitive and specific biomarker. This&#xD;
      is a metabolic product likely to be involved in the pathophysiology of the disease. Therefore&#xD;
      it is the goal of the study to validate this new biochemical marker from the blood (plasma)&#xD;
      of the affected patients helping to benefit other patients by an early diagnose and thereby&#xD;
      with an earlier treatment. Examining blood samples will allow to determine whether&#xD;
      measurement of the identified marker lyso-Gb1-Sulfatid is feasible in blood samples and will&#xD;
      further promote early detection of MLD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Though MLD is a pan-ethnic disorder, the prevalence of this autosomal-recessive disorder is&#xD;
      elevated in countries with a higher frequency of consanguinity. Therefore, we estimate that&#xD;
      every 400th newborn in Arabian countries may be eligible for inclusion due to high-grade&#xD;
      suspicion of MLD, while approximately every 2000th newborn in a non-Arabian country may be&#xD;
      eligible.&#xD;

      For the development of the new biomarkers using the technique of mass-spectometry, 10 ml EDTA&#xD;
      blood sample and/or a dry blood spot filter card-blood sample will be taken from the patient.&#xD;
      To prove the correct Metachromatic Leukodystrophy diagnosis in those patients where up to the&#xD;
      enrolment in the study no genetic testing has been done, sequencing of Metachromatic&#xD;
      Leukodystrophy will be done as routine diagnostic.&#xD;
