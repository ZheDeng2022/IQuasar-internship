  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the effect of a diet prior to cardiac surgery on the&#xD;
      common postoperative decline of renal function. Until now, there is no known drug or&#xD;
      procedure to preserve the kidneys from this impairment. Patients with a known kidney disease&#xD;
      are especially at risk. A potential beneficial effect of a diet prior to surgery has been&#xD;
      shown in investigations in mammals, therefore this study will investigate if a preoperative&#xD;
      diet in patients with known kidney disease and scheduled heart surgery can attenuate or&#xD;
      prevent a postoperative loss of kidney function.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients with cardiothoracic surgery are at risk for postoperative acute renal failure which&#xD;
      is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. There is no drug or procedure known&#xD;
      to prevent this loss of renal function. Experimental data suggests, that a preoperative&#xD;
      caloric restriction might provide kidney protection in this context. This clinical trial&#xD;
      investigates if this phenomenon is also applicable in humans. Patients with a increased risk&#xD;
      for a postoperative renal failure due to known chronic kidney disease are randomized in 2&#xD;
      groups. Patients of the diet group receive a calorie restriction to 60% of the calculated&#xD;
      daily energy rate from day -7 until day -1 (included) pre-surgery (day 0 corresponds to day&#xD;
      of surgery). Patients of the control group receive alimentation ad libitum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective is the increase of serum creatinine in mg/dl 24 h after induction of&#xD;
      ischemia (&quot;cross clamping&quot;) in comparison to baseline value obtained in the morning of the&#xD;
      day of surgery (day 0) in order to analyse if a preoperative calorie restriction as a&#xD;
      preventive strategy leads to a attenuation of postoperative kidney injury. Hypothesis: A&#xD;
      seven day calorie restriction reduces the increase of serum creatinine after cardiac surgery&#xD;
      in patients with known chronic kidney disease.&#xD;
