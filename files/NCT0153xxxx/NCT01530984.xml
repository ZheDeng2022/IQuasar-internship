  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label randomized phase II study. Patients are randomized so as to achieve&#xD;
      uniform patient cohorts treated on each regimen. Twenty-seven patients will be required per&#xD;
      treatment arm, and a total of 54 prostate cancer patients will be required to complete this&#xD;
      study. The study will assess for clinical activity by Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA)&#xD;
      response, of both single agent ipilimumab and the combination of GM-CSF and ipilimumab in&#xD;
      chemotherapy-naïve patients with metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ipilimumab is an antibody (proteins that can find and destroy foreign molecules such as those&#xD;
      on bacteria and viruses) against CTLA-4 (a molecule that controls a part of the immune system&#xD;
      by shutting it down). It is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat&#xD;
      patients with late-stage melanoma, skin cancer. The use of ipilimumab in patients with CRPC&#xD;
      has not been approved by the FDA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some patients in this study will receive GM-CSF along with ipilimumab. In clinical trials,&#xD;
      GM-CSF has been safely given to prostate cancer patients in combination with ipilimumab.&#xD;
      GM-CSF is not approved by the FDA for use as treatment for prostate cancer. Studies in&#xD;
      patients with prostate cancer suggest that GM-CSF may activate the immune system. Since&#xD;
      ipilimumab can help keep the immune system from turning off and allow an immune reaction to&#xD;
      occur, and GM-CSF can increase the activity of the immune system, it is possible that they&#xD;
      may work together to increase the immune response to cancer. The use of ipilimumab in&#xD;
      combination with GM-CSF in patients with CRPC has not been approved by the FDA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is theorized that if antigen presentation could be improved, the immunostimulatory effects&#xD;
      of CTLA-4 blockade could be augmented with improvements in clinical response. To that end,&#xD;
      UCSF conducted a phase I clinical trial of ipilimumab in combination with GM-CSF, a cytokine&#xD;
      that has been demonstrated to enhance the functional activities of effector cells, including&#xD;
      dendritic cells (DC), neutrophils, and monocytes, in chemotherapy-naïve men with CRPC&#xD;
      (Protocol 6032).32 Exposure to GM-CSF increases class II MHC expression on dendritic cells&#xD;
      and is thought to lead to increased antigen presentation to T cells, stimulating T cell&#xD;
      responses, although this mechanism has not been confirmed. We have extensively studied the&#xD;
      effects of treatment demonstrating a dose-response relationship in the activation of CD4 and&#xD;
      CD8 T cells. Moreover, the expansion of activated (CD25+CD69+) CD4 and CD8 T cells seen with&#xD;
      this GM-CSF/ipilimumab combination trial was higher than that seen with GM-CSF or ipilimumab&#xD;
      monotherapy seen in our other trials in prostate cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are proposing to conduct a non-comparative randomized phase II study of repetitive dosing&#xD;
      of ipilimumab either alone or in combination with GM-CSF in patients with metastatic CRPC.&#xD;
      The dosing interval for ipilimumab is based on the prior study which demonstrated drug levels&#xD;
      ≥ 10 mg/mL (a minimum level required for CTLA-4 blockade in pre-clinical models) for greater&#xD;
      than 28 days. Six doses of ipilimumab were chosen because six doses have been given safely in&#xD;
      other trials. Maintenance dosing every three months is empirical, but this dosing frequency&#xD;
      is based on discussions with Medarex, Inc. and Bristol-Meyers Squibb and is based on reports&#xD;
      indicating the safety and potential efficacy of this maintenance regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will use ipilimumab given every 28 days for six cycles (induction) followed by&#xD;
      administration once every three months for patients who are not progressing (maintenance). A&#xD;
      dosage of 10 mg/kg has been chosen based on the results to date of the phase I study. GM-CSF&#xD;
      250 mcg/m2 SQ will be administered on days 1-14 in Cycles 1-6 and then every 3 months for 14&#xD;
      days beginning on the day of ipilimumab administration during the maintenance therapy phase.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Histologically confirmed, metastatic prostate cancer (positive bone scan and/or&#xD;
             measurable disease on CT scan and/or MRI of the abdomen and pelvis).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Progressive disease after androgen deprivation, as defined by PSA Working Group 237&#xD;
             and/or RECIST criteria.38 Patients must have disease progression by one or both of the&#xD;
             following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For patients with measurable disease, progression is defined as at least a 20%&#xD;
                  increase in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions or the&#xD;
                  appearance of one or more new lesions, as per RECIST criteria version 1.1&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For patients with no measurable disease, a positive bone scan and elevated PSA&#xD;
                  will be required. PSA evidence for progressive prostate cancer consists of a PSA&#xD;
                  level of at least 2 ng/ml, which has risen on at least 2 successive occasions, at&#xD;
                  least 1 week apart. If the confirmatory PSA (#3) value is not greater (i.e., #3b)&#xD;
                  than the screening PSA (#2) value, then an additional test for rising PSA (#4)&#xD;
                  will be required to document progression&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If no prior orchiectomy has been performed, patients must remain on LHRH agonist&#xD;
                  or antagonist therapy. Patients who are receiving an antiandrogen as part of&#xD;
                  primary androgen ablation must demonstrate disease progression following&#xD;
                  discontinuation of the antiandrogen, defined as two consecutive rising PSA&#xD;
                  values, obtained at least two weeks apart, or documented osseous or soft tissue&#xD;
                  progression. At least one of the PSA values must be obtained at least four weeks&#xD;
                  (flutamide) or six weeks (bicalutamide or nilutamide) after discontinuation&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Laboratory requirements:&#xD;

                  ng/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 - 2 and life expectancy&#xD;
             &gt; 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. At least 18 years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients receiving any other hormonal therapy, including any dose of megestrol acetate&#xD;
             (Megace), Proscar (finasteride), any herbal product known to decrease PSA levels (e.g.&#xD;
             Saw Palmetto, PC-SPES), or any systemic corticosteroid, must discontinue the agent for&#xD;
             at least four weeks prior to study treatment. Progressive disease as defined above&#xD;
             must be documented after discontinuation of any hormonal therapy (with the exception&#xD;
             of a LHRH agonist or antagonist).&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Prior chemotherapy for prostate cancer, with the exception of neoadjuvant&#xD;
             chemotherapy, because of the potential effect of chemotherapy on the immune system.&#xD;

             ability of patients to provide informed consent for themselves.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Cardiovascular disease that meets one of the following: congestive heart failure (New&#xD;
             York Heart Association Class III or IV), active angina pectoris, or recent myocardial&#xD;
             infarction (within the last 6 months).&#xD;
