  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has declared that AIDS is a &quot;state of&#xD;
      emergency&quot; in the US for African Americans - young African American men are especially&#xD;
      vulnerable in this epidemic. Thus, the development of effective interventions tailored to&#xD;
      this population is a national priority. The investigators previous preliminary studies&#xD;
      suggest that a brief, clinic-initiated, home-based, self-guided condom use program may&#xD;
      effectively promote the acceptance of condom use and increase the quality and consistency of&#xD;
      condom-protected sexual behaviors. This pilot study will (1) develop and test the feasibility&#xD;
      of this program (Homework Intervention Strategy, HIS) for young African American men&#xD;
      attending an urban STD clinic and (2) identify variables that may mediate the efficacy of the&#xD;
      program. The HIS has the potential to be readily translated into widespread practice, while&#xD;
      requiring only minimal resources. Unlike previously tested interventions, the HIS can be&#xD;
      applied to all men who use condoms, regardless of the sex of their partners or their HIV/STI&#xD;
      status. To develop the HIS to meet the needs of these high-risk men, the proposed study will&#xD;
      include a formative phase during which the basic intervention &quot;instructions&quot; which will be&#xD;
      delivered by DVD will be refined and tailored for this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One hundred young African American men recruited from an urban STD clinic will be randomized&#xD;
      to each of two groups (HIS vs. &quot;standard of care&quot;) in a randomized 2-arm trial with 5&#xD;
      assessment periods over the course of 6 months. Assessments will compare the groups on&#xD;
      frequency of unprotected sex, quality of the condom use experience, experience of condom use&#xD;
      errors and problems, attitudes regarding condom use, condom use acceptability, and condom use&#xD;
      self-efficacy and confidence.&#xD;
