  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease that affects approximately 1% of&#xD;
      all Canadians. RA is associated with a higher rate of disease and death as well as a&#xD;
      decreased life expectancy. Changes in death rates and life expectancy are mainly the result&#xD;
      of an increased frequency of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The increase in CVD frequency is&#xD;
      primarily attributable to accelerated atherosclerosis. It is believed that elevated levels of&#xD;
      inflammation, which are characteristic of RA, play a key role in accelerated rate of CVD in&#xD;
      RA patients. Thus, inflammation is considered a primary risk factor for CVD in RA patients.&#xD;
      Interestingly, despite a better understanding of the relationship between RA and CVD and&#xD;
      improved treatment for RA patients the death rate in RA population continues to increase.&#xD;
      Thus, there is an immediate need to develop treatment strategies to reduce the risk of CVD&#xD;
      associated with inflammation in the RA population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise is commonly used to reduce the risk of CVD. Preventative exercise programs are often&#xD;
      offered as part of cardiac rehabilitation (CR) programs. These programs help patients modify&#xD;
      CVD risk factors, improve physical capacity and decrease CVD risk. Studies also suggest that&#xD;
      CR programs decrease levels of inflammation. Since RA patients have an elevated risk for CVD,&#xD;
      which is primarily attributed to increased levels of inflammation, they are prime candidates&#xD;
      for CR programs. However, RA patients are very rarely referred to CR programs. Thus, there is&#xD;
      a lack of information regarding the effects of CR on RA patients. Thus studies are needed to&#xD;
      determine whether CR modifies levels of inflammation and decreases CVD risk in RA patients.&#xD;
      Therefore, the purpose of this study is to determine the effects of a 12-week standardized&#xD;
      cardiac rehabilitation exercise program on systemic inflammation and CVD risk in individuals&#xD;
      with RA. Specifically, this study will characterize the effects of a community based CR&#xD;
      exercise program on systemic markers of inflammation (proinflammatory cytokines) and global&#xD;
      CVD risk (Framingham risk profile) as well as the therapeutic effects of CR exercise on the&#xD;
      severity of RA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will help to clarify the mechanism(s) by which exercise impacts CVD risk in&#xD;
      patients with inflammatory disease. In addition, the study will show how CR may benefit&#xD;
      patients with inflammatory disease with respect to their ability to exercise, global risk for&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease and quality of life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease that impacts approximately 1% of&#xD;
      all Canadians. RA is associated with increased mortality, decreased life expectancy and&#xD;
      increased morbidity, which is primarily attributable to an increased risk of cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease (CVD). Traditional risk factors (e.g. dyslipidemia, hypertension, physical&#xD;
      inactivity, etc.) contribute, in part, to the elevated risk of CVD in individuals with RA.&#xD;
      However, the higher incidence of CVD events in RA appears to be independent of the influence&#xD;
      of traditional CVD risk factors. Non-traditional risk factors, such as inflammation, also&#xD;
      contribute to the increased risk of CVD in RA patients. In fact, when traditional CVD risk&#xD;
      factors and co-morbidities are controlled for in people with RA, markers of systemic&#xD;
      inflammation confer a significant additional risk for CV death. This suggests that systemic&#xD;
      inflammation significantly contributes to the increased risk of CVD in individuals with RA.&#xD;
      Thus, there is an immediate need to develop intervention strategies to reduce the&#xD;
      inflammatory mediated risk of CVD in the RA population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One possible intervention that could be used to decrease CVD risk in RA patients is exercise.&#xD;
      Exercise can modify both traditional (e.g. dyslipidemia) and non-traditional (e.g.&#xD;
      inflammation) risk factors to decrease the risk of CVD. For patients with cardiac disease,&#xD;
      clinical guidelines recommend regular exercise. For this, patients are referred to cardiac&#xD;
      rehabilitation (CR) programs, where exercise represents the cornerstone of the program. The&#xD;
      goal of these programs is modify CVD risk factors, improve physical capacity and decrease CVD&#xD;
      risk. Thus, CR programs may offer a suitable therapeutic intervention to help decrease CVD&#xD;
      risk in RA patients. However, RA patients are rarely referred to CR despite their increased&#xD;
      risk of CVD. Thus, the effects of CR on inflammation and CVD risk in patients with RA remains&#xD;
      unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of a 12-week cardiac rehabilitation&#xD;
      exercise program on systemic inflammation and CVD risk in individuals with RA. The specific&#xD;
      objectives of the study are: 1) to determine whether it is feasible for RA patients to&#xD;
      complete a 12-week high intensity CR exercise program, 2) examine the effects of a 12-week&#xD;
      standardized CR exercise program on systemic markers of inflammation in individuals with RA,&#xD;
      3) to examine the effects of a 12-week standardized CR exercise program on CVD risk in&#xD;
      individuals with RA and 4) to characterize the effects a 12-week standardized CR exercise&#xD;
      program on the severity of the patient's RA and their functional ability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is meant to be a pilot study that will help provide insight into the therapeutic&#xD;
      effects of CR on inflammation and CVD risk in RA patients. Based on the results from this&#xD;
      preliminary work, a larger scale study will be developed to evaluate the effects of exercise&#xD;
      intensity on cardiovascular risk in patients with inflammatory disease as well as the effects&#xD;
      of exercise on decision making for pharmacological intervention (e.g. statin therapy) in this&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: This pilot study is a randomized controlled study. Subjects will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to one of two groups: 1) control (CON) or 2) CR program with high intensity exercise&#xD;
      (CRH). Outcome measures will be assessed at baseline (week-0) and post-intervention&#xD;
      (week-13). The primary measures include CVD risk, levels of systemic inflammation and&#xD;
      severity of RA. Secondary measures include weight, waist girth, resting heart rate, resting&#xD;
      blood pressure (BP), lipid profile, fasting glucose, aerobic fitness, physical activity (PA)&#xD;
      levels, functional ability, tobacco use and alcohol consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Screening: If the individual agrees to participate in the study, they will be asked&#xD;
      if they use tobacco regularly and if they are a diabetic, have their BP measured and sent for&#xD;
      routine blood work. Blood tests will be performed to determine the patient's lipid profile&#xD;
      (total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol&#xD;
      and triglycerides). The patient's BP, answers to the aforementioned questions (e.g. tobacco,&#xD;
      diabetes) and their lipid profile results will be used to calculate the patient's Framingham&#xD;
      risk score, which estimates the 10-year CV risk of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria: Only those patients that 1) are 20 years of age or older 2) have RA&#xD;
      fulfilling the American College of Rheumatology criteria, 3) have zero or more swollen&#xD;
      joints, 4) are receiving stable pharmacotherapy (defined as greater than 3 months of&#xD;
      unchanged antirheumatic drugs and greater than 1 month of unchanged nonsteroidal&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drugs), 5) have moderate risk of CVD as identified by the Framingham risk&#xD;
      score, 6) are able to walk on treadmill or cycle on a stationary bike for 15 minutes and 7)&#xD;
      are able to attend the Community Cardiovascular Hearts in Motion program (held in the Halifax&#xD;
      Regional Municipality) will be asked to participate in the study. Any patients that meet the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria, but are 1) known to have coronary, cerebral or peripheral artery disease,&#xD;
      2) taking statins, or 3) have one or more arthroplasties of weight bearing joints, will not&#xD;
      be eligible to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size: The study will recruit 60 participants, 30 CON and 30 CRH..&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: Variables pertaining to RA, CVD and PA will be measured in all subjects&#xD;
      (CON, CRH) at two different time points during the study. Specifically, the subjects will be&#xD;
      assessed at baseline (week-0) and then be reassessed post 12-week intervention (week-13). The&#xD;
      post CR intervention assessment will be conducted 72 hours after the completion of the final&#xD;
      exercise session. The variables that will be measured at week-0 and week-13 are listed in&#xD;
      section B1e and the tools used to assess these outcomes are described below. Of note, the&#xD;
      physicians/nurse conducting the assessments will be blinded in regards to which group the&#xD;
      subject is assigned to.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RA Severity: Severity of RA will be determined using the American College of Rheumatology&#xD;
      (ACR) response score. The ACR is a composite score based on 7 measures: 3 by an assessor&#xD;
      (swollen joint, tender joint count and physician global status), 3 by the patient (function,&#xD;
      pain and global status) and one acute phase measure (CRP). The ACR examination will be&#xD;
      conducted by a rheumatologist (VB, Coinvestigator).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aerobic Fitness: The subject's aerobic fitness will be determined based on the results from a&#xD;
      stress test. All stress tests will be conducted by a cardiac research nurse. In brief,&#xD;
      subjects will perform a graded exercise test (Bruce treadmill protocol) where speed and&#xD;
      inclination of the treadmill increase every 3 minutes. The subject will be asked to exercise&#xD;
      to volitional fatigue. Cardiac function will be monitored with a 12 lead ECG. The ECG data&#xD;
      also will be used to determine if there is any evidence of cardiac disease (e.g. arrhythmia).&#xD;
      Predictive equations developed for men and women will be used to calculate the subject's peak&#xD;
      oxygen uptake. This value will represent the subject's aerobic fitness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical Activity: The subject's current level of PA will be measured using the long form of&#xD;
      the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. This questionnaire is suitable for use&#xD;
      with clinical populations and has been used previously to quantify physical activity levels&#xD;
      in RA patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional Ability: Functional status will be assessed using the short form of the Health&#xD;
      Assessment questionnaire (HAQ). This is a self report questionnaire that is comprised of the&#xD;
      HAQ disability index, HAQ patient global health status and the pain visual analog scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood Analysis: Blood samples will be drawn by either the research nurse or a physician.&#xD;
      Samples will be processed at the local hospital to determine the subject's lipid profile,&#xD;
      fasting glucose and CRP levels. Serum also will be extracted from the blood samples. Markers&#xD;
      of systemic inflammation (cytokines) will be quantified in the serum samples. Specifically,&#xD;
      tests will quantify levels of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-17 and&#xD;
      TNFα as well as the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-4 and IL-10. Analysis will be performed at&#xD;
      Dalhousie University (SG, PI) using a BioRad Bioplex Suspension Array System. All serum&#xD;
      samples will be stored at -20°C until they are required for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomly assigned to either the CON or CRH group. Subjects assigned to the&#xD;
      CON will receive treatment for their RA that is considered standard care (e.g.&#xD;
      pharmacotherapy), but will not be enrolled in the CR program. Subjects in the CON group will&#xD;
      be asked to maintain their current level of PA during the course of the 12-week study. CON&#xD;
      subjects will be given a log book to record their daily activity as well as report any&#xD;
      significant changes in their PA level that occur during the study. Subjects assigned to the&#xD;
      exercise group (CRH) will receive standard care for RA plus be enrolled in a CR program&#xD;
      (Community Cardiovascular Hearts Motion Program, Halifax Regional Municipality, NS). The CR&#xD;
      program is 12-weeks in duration and will be supervised by a nurse, a physiotherapist and a&#xD;
      research assistant. The CR program is composed of one 60 minute education session per week&#xD;
      and two 60 minute exercise sessions. The education sessions will be conducted by a&#xD;
      multidisciplinary team of health professionals (nurse, physiotherapist and dietician). Topics&#xD;
      covered include heart healthy eating, setting health-related goal, exercise, nutrition,&#xD;
      healthy weight, smoking cessation and stress/coping. Some education sessions will be modified&#xD;
      to better suit RA subjects (e.g. CVD medication session). The exercise sessions are based on&#xD;
      standard of care for CVD patients. Exercise sessions will begin with a group a warm-up&#xD;
      activity, followed by 45 minutes of aerobic activity and ending with a cool down. Aerobic&#xD;
      activity will consist of walking/running on a treadmill, stepping exercise and/or cycling on&#xD;
      a cycle ergometer. The subject will be encouraged to rotate through the various exercise&#xD;
      machines (e.g. 15 minutes treadmill, 15 minutes cycle, 15 minutes stepper). All aerobic&#xD;
      exercise will be performed at high intensity, which for the present study is defined as&#xD;
      exercise that elicits a HR between 60-80% of heart rate reserve (HRR). Subjects will keep a&#xD;
      log book for the duration of the program that details their exercise sessions. Subjects will&#xD;
      record resting heart rate, type of exercise performed, duration of the exercise and HR during&#xD;
      the exercise sessions. The subject also may add any relevant notes. All exercise sessions&#xD;
      will be closely monitored by a nurse, physiotherapist and a research assistant. Prior to the&#xD;
      initial CR exercise session target heart rates will be calculated for each subject based on&#xD;
      the maximum HR achieved during their stress test. Subjects will be taught how to palpate&#xD;
      radial and/or carotid pulse during the first week of the CR program. This will enable the&#xD;
      subject to monitor and maintain their HR within the target HR zone while performing their&#xD;
      aerobic exercise.&#xD;
