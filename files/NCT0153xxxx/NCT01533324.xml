    <textblock>
      S-1 is a new chemotherapy drug. Some phase II trials showed S-1 is effective in&#xD;
      Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC). S-1 combined with calcium folinate (SL) showed very good&#xD;
      efficiency and safety in colorectal cancer (CRC). The short duration (two weekly regimen) is&#xD;
      better than common course 4 week regimen in tolerance. So the investigators want to examine&#xD;
      the efficiency and safety of SL one week on and one week off regimen in HCC.&#xD;

&#xD;
      SL one week on and one week off regimen will be give to advanced HCC patients. The primary&#xD;
      endpoint is durable complete response (DCR).&#xD;
