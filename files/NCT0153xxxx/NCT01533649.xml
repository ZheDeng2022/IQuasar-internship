  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The assumption of the unpredictability of seizures may have an enormous impact on the&#xD;
      perception of self-efficacy and may contribute more to a patient's poor quality-of-life than&#xD;
      the actual seizures. Patients with epilepsy are especially susceptible to the influence of&#xD;
      the arbitrary nature of this condition on socialization,education,and the formation of&#xD;
      self-identity. Consequentially, the psychosocial and psychological aftermath is likely to be&#xD;
      observed even in individuals with well-controlled seizures. The relationship between seizure&#xD;
      occurrence and the effects of having epileptic seizures on quality of life can be&#xD;
      characterized as reciprocal; e.g. emotional stress is not only a result of having seizures;&#xD;
      it is also the most frequently reported seizure precipitant. Whereas behavioral interventions&#xD;
      have repeatedly been considered as the third pillar of the treatment of epilepsy, the main&#xD;
      focus still remains on passive seizure control per pharmacological and surgical&#xD;
      interventions, which may further aggravate victimization. Outcome after epilepsy surgery is&#xD;
      closely correlated with pre-surgical characteristics. Consequentially, there is an upsurge of&#xD;
      interest in the medical community for research on non-pharmacologic interventions to&#xD;
      facilitate the transition from chronically sick to well with preventive therapeutic&#xD;
      interventions in the context of habitual seizures. The Andrews/Reiter (AR) approach to&#xD;
      epilepsy is a systematic counseling intervention that assists the individual to identify&#xD;
      seizure warning signs,seizure precipitants and general life stressors in order to develop&#xD;
      strategies of active seizure control and improve self-defined life quality. Literature review&#xD;
      indicates that AR represents the most comprehensively developed psychological approach. The&#xD;
      proposed trial will address the question if AR decreases seizure frequency and&#xD;
      psychopathologic comorbidities and increases seizure self-efficacy and overall quality of&#xD;
      life in patients with medically intractable epilepsy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Potential subjects will be systematically approached during a 3 years enrollment period to&#xD;
      recruit a consecutive sample of the patient population receiving care at a tertiary care&#xD;
      epilepsy center (Toronto Western Hospital). After an 8 week period to establish baseline&#xD;
      measurements the proposed trial will allocate study subjects to an A/R intervention group or&#xD;
      a relaxation/meditation control group or a usual care control group (N1=N2=N3=10) per their&#xD;
      preference due to the fact that internalization of the therapeutic principles is an active&#xD;
      process that requires continuous motivation and compliance of the patient with the&#xD;
      intervention. If a subject displays high intrinsic motivation to engage in self-care&#xD;
      enhancing activities but does not indicate a preference, he or she will get randomized to&#xD;
      either the A/R intervention or the relaxation protocol. This trial design allows for&#xD;
      measuring effect sizes in regard the potential effect of choice, and also whether there is&#xD;
      any interaction between preference and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will determine the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. The fraction of (a) seizure-free subjects and (b) subjects with clinically meaningful,&#xD;
      i.e. ≥ 90% or ≥ 50 reduction of seizure frequency, II. Changes of the subjective perception&#xD;
      of disability as indicated by Subjective Handicap of Epilepsy Scale (SHE), III. Changes of&#xD;
      seizure self-efficacy as indicated by Multidimensional Health Locus of Control (M-HLOC), Form&#xD;
      C and Epilepsy Self-Efficacy Scale (ESES), IV. Changes in common psychopathologic&#xD;
      comorbidities and stress as indicated by (a) Neurological Disorders Depression Inventory in&#xD;
      Epilepsy (NDDI-E), (b) State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), (c) Profile of Mood States (POMS&#xD;
      brief), and (d) Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), V. Changes in quality of life as indicated by&#xD;
      (a) Quality of Life in Epilepsy (QOLIE-89), (b) individually identified descriptors of&#xD;
      various domains of life and (c) individually identified epilepsy-related distresses.&#xD;
      Continuous measures (aims I and III b) will be obtained during months 9 and 10 after initial&#xD;
      subject enrollment. All other measures will be obtained at the end of month 10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Protocols: During months 3-5 the A/R intervention protocol devotes one&#xD;
      face-to-face counseling session to each of the 11 chapters (&quot;steps&quot;) of the workbook &quot;Taking&#xD;
      control of your epilepsy&quot; which will be followed by weekly phone calls during months 6-8. A/R&#xD;
      treatment plans include daily activities: Journaling (10 min), CD-guided relaxation (10-30&#xD;
      min), Workbook (10 min) to promote functional analysis of seizure context and development of&#xD;
      coping strategies. The trial will be used for knowledge-translation as trainees delivering&#xD;
      the intervention will be supervised by Donna Andrews, PhD, co-developer of the AR&#xD;
      intervention. The relaxation and meditation protocol will consist of weekly 30 min session&#xD;
      during months 3-5 and bi-weekly 60 min sessions during months 6-8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects are instructed to document seizure occurrences (number and type) and compliance&#xD;
      with AEDs. They will continue to see their treating neurologist and adjustment of their&#xD;
      antiepileptic medication will be made if necessary. Medication changes will be included in&#xD;
      outcome analyses. Regular serum levels will be drawn to monitor drug compliance. Study&#xD;
      subjects will be approached at 12, 24 and 36 months after the end of the pilot trial to&#xD;
      obtain follow-up data. The sample size determination the investigators based on literature&#xD;
      review, assuming the remission rate for the usual care group was 5% and 35% for the A/R&#xD;
      intervention group and inflated by 30% to account for loss to non-compliance. Outcomes will&#xD;
      be compared as found in groups as a whole.&#xD;
