  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent advances in understanding the biology and genetics of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) have&#xD;
      led to major therapeutic implications. Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene inactivation, present in&#xD;
      the majority of sporadic forms of RCC, leads to a defective VHL protein, followed by an&#xD;
      active transcription of hypoxia-inducible genes, including vascular endothelial growth factor&#xD;
      (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), c-kit, and others. However, the concept of VHL&#xD;
      inactivation in RCC and the subsequent malignant phenotype is almost exclusively seen in&#xD;
      patients with clear cell histology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data about efficacy of VEGF receptor inhibitors for non-clear cell RCC (NCRCC) is rare&#xD;
      until now. Recently, however, sunitinib and sorafenib showed its worth for NCRCC in extended&#xD;
      access programs.1-3 Although it is not certain, the underlying mechanism of their action&#xD;
      might lie in that papillary, chromophobe, and sarcomatoid type overexpress c-kit, which is&#xD;
      also a target of both drugs and could therefore provide a therapeutic target for non-clear&#xD;
      cell subtypes.4-7 Pazopanib is also a potent and selective, orally available, small molecule&#xD;
      inhibitor of VEGFR-1,-2, and -3, PDGF-α, PDGF-β, and c-kit tyrosine kinases. It has been&#xD;
      validated and licensed for advanced clear cell RCC (CCRCC).8 However, there is very few data&#xD;
      about its efficacy for NCRCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we try to evaluate the efficacy of pazopanib in metastatic NCRCC.&#xD;
