  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinical management of very low birth weight newborns (VLBW &lt;1250g) consists in several&#xD;
      challenges to adapt immature physiological systems to extrauterine life. Advances in neonatal&#xD;
      medicine for pulmonary and/or neurological and/or cardiovascular diseases have significantly&#xD;
      improved outcomes of these children. However, the gastro-intestinal (GI) tract remains a&#xD;
      major cause of morbidity due to&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the immaturity of GI functions (prolonged ileus, bacterial overgrowth and&#xD;
           translocation),&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the complication of GI tract immaturity: intestinal perforation and enterocolitis&#xD;
           necrotizing)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. the need of a prolonged parenteral nutrition and its complications (central venous&#xD;
           catheter infections, sepsis, electrolyte disturbances) but without generate a high proof&#xD;
           level on this targeted population (&lt;1250g).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The GI functions are progressively acquired during development and are largely sensitive to&#xD;
      the environment, especially the intestinal luminal content. Indeed, probiotics and prebiotics&#xD;
      have shown beneficial effects upon GI functions of newborns. One of the metabolite of the gut&#xD;
      flora potentially involved is the butyrate. Butyrate is a short chain fatty acid produced in&#xD;
      the colon by the microbiota (carbo-hydrates degradation). The colonic amount of butyrate&#xD;
      increases gradually after birth. The beneficial effects of butyrate are related to its&#xD;
      properties upon the epithelial barrier (anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, barrier repair) and&#xD;
      upon the enteric nervous system (network of neurons and glial cells) that regulate GI&#xD;
      functions and in particular colonic motility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, there is no clinical consensus to manage digestive disorders of VLBW. Several&#xD;
      clinical studies have assessed the effects of prokinetic drugs, dietary supplements&#xD;
      (probiotics, prebiotics) but without generate a high proof level on this targeted population.&#xD;
      In this context, a recent study of our Research Unit (INSERM-CIC MÃ¨re-Enfant 004) has shown&#xD;
      benefit effects of oral probiotics supplementation in children with birth weight greater than&#xD;
      1000g but not in extreme preterms with birth weight less than 1000g.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main hypothesis to explain theses results lies in the intensive use of antibiotic and&#xD;
      feeding interruption frequency in this targeted population which induce disturbances in the&#xD;
      composition of the gut lumen (in particular the flora).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Colonic enemas assessed in various observational studies concerning VLBW seem to demonstrate&#xD;
      a clinical efficiency upon the colonic transit, underlying by mechanical and osmotic&#xD;
      mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Here, the investigators propose to evaluate the clinical efficiency of butyrate enemas by a&#xD;
      prospective randomized clinical trial blinded design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of NEOTRANS study is to demonstrate that butyrate enemas may improve the&#xD;
      nutritional management of extreme preterm less than 1250 grams, by facilitating the&#xD;
      development of colic motility and clinical nutrition tolerance.&#xD;

    <description>The primary outcome of NEOTRANS study consists in the evaluation of the effects of colonic butyrate enemas upon the digestive maturation of preterms.&#xD;
This endpoint is based on a clinical criteria that is the delay of weaning of the parenteral nutrition support. An increase of 25% (50 vs 75%) will be considered clinically significant.&#xD;
Parenteral nutrition weaning is defined as the day where enteral caloric intake reach 80% of total calories.</description>

Possibility to delay from 24 to 48 hours the procedure in case of clinical poor tolerance(maximum two enemas postponed and delayed at PND12 and PND13)&#xD;
The study remains blinded for the investigation team through the intervention of a clinical research nurse&#xD;
According to the procedure previously described by Nakaoka et al. (2009), a lubricated Foley catheter Ch 6 will be introduced into the rectum, the balloon will be inflated with 1 ml water for injections. Butyrate solution will be placed in a bag placed 50 cm above the child. Therefore, treatment administration will be performed at a controlled pressure of 50 cm H2O without any manual intervention&#xD;
Installation time and retention is setted at 15 minutes&#xD;
Treatment units will be directly placed in the incubator 30 min before the procedure to warm the enema to +36Â°C&#xD;
Per-treatment clinical monitoring of the tolerance will be performed by a neonatologist</description>
