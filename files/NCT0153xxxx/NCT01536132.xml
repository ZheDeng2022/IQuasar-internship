      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of intravenous&#xD;
      administration of intermittent doses of levosimendan (infusions of 0,2 μg/kg/min, of&#xD;
      levosimendan or placebo, without bolus, for 6 hours every 2 weeks) compared to placebo in&#xD;
      ambulatory patients with advanced chronic heart failure.&#xD;

      The LION-HEART study (Levosimendan® Intermittent administration in Outpatients: effects on&#xD;
      Natriuretic peptides in advanced chronic HEART failure) was a multicenter, double-blind,&#xD;
      randomized, parallel group, placebo-controlled trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      intravenous administration of intermittent doses of levosimendan in outpatients with advanced&#xD;
      chronic heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design and Oversight Between November 2010 and December 2012,69 patients fulfilling&#xD;
      inclusion criteria were enrolled from 12 recruiting centers in Spain (Figure 1). The study&#xD;
      protocol was approved by institutional review board of each participating center and&#xD;
      conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki (1996),&#xD;
      International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice, and local and national&#xD;
      regulations. All enrolled patients provided written informed consentbefore any study-related&#xD;
      procedure was undertaken. The study was registered on the website www.ClinicalTrials.gov&#xD;
      (unique identifier: NCT01536132) and the EudraCT database (2009-014242-28). The trial was&#xD;
      designed, implemented and overseen by the Steering Committee. On-site monitoring of the&#xD;
      study, data collection and data management was performed by a Clinical Research Organization&#xD;
      (CRO, 3DHealth). The manuscript was written and submitted by the Steering Committee members.&#xD;
      All contributing authors had full access to study data and analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population, eligibility and recruitment The study was divided in three different parts:&#xD;
      1) screening (1 week), 2) treatment (12 weeks) and 3) follow-up (12 weeks). An additional&#xD;
      vital status assessment was planned after 12 months of enrolment (Figure 2, design of the&#xD;
      study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility was assessed at the screening phase, once the written informed consent was&#xD;
      obtained. Inclusion criteria for this study were: age over 18 years, left ventricular&#xD;
      ejection fraction (LVEF) of less than 35% measured in the previous 6 months and clinical&#xD;
      diagnosis of advanced chronic HF (Metra M et al. Eur J Heart Fail 2007;&#xD;
      9(6-7):684-694)according to the following criteria: a) presence for &gt;3 months of typical&#xD;
      signs and symptoms of HF b) persistent ambulatory NYHA functional class III or IV for the&#xD;
      last 4 weeks, c) no signs of congestion or low cardiac output at the time of enrolment, d)&#xD;
      episodes of pulmonary and/or systemic congestion requiring intravenous administration of&#xD;
      diuretics (either hospitalized or in an ambulatory basis) in the previous 12 months, e) all&#xD;
      the previous criteria were present despite optimal medical management (including use of&#xD;
      diuretics, antagonists of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and beta-blockers) and&#xD;
      device therapy (including implantable cardioverter defibrillator-ICD and/or cardiac&#xD;
      resynchronization therapy-CRT) or attempts to optimize it. Major exclusion criteria were:&#xD;
      concurrent inclusion in another study, the presence of left ventricular tract obstruction,&#xD;
      uncorrected significant primary valve disease, recent acute coronary syndrome or stroke,&#xD;
      hypertrophic or restrictive cardiomyopathy, administration of amrinone, milrinone, enoximone,&#xD;
      dopamine or dobutamine in the previous 3 days, administration of levosimendan in the previous&#xD;
      31 days, serum potassium below 3.5mmol/L, estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt;30ml/min/m2&#xD;
      (MDRD-4 formula), systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mmHg orheart rate &gt; 110 bpm at screening,&#xD;
      planned or ongoing evaluation for any of the following procedures: CRT, ICD, coronary&#xD;
      revascularization, heart transplant or left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implant, other&#xD;
      acute or chronic conditions that would made the patient unsuitable for this study according&#xD;
      to the investigator's judgement, anticipated poor compliance and inability or unwillingness&#xD;
      to give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and Blinding Eligible patients that signed the informed consent were randomized&#xD;
      in a 2:1 ratio to receive either Levosimendan or placebo. Randomization was centrally&#xD;
      conducted and supervised by the CRO. The computer-generated randomization scheme used random&#xD;
      permuted blocks stratified per center. Once the patient was allocated to Levosimendan of&#xD;
      placebo, the CRO communicated the exact treatment number to the local hospital pharmacy which&#xD;
      handed out the treatment to the local investigator at each infusion cycle. Levosimendan and&#xD;
      placebo had the same appearance thus the treatment was concealed to both investigators and&#xD;
      study patients (double blind).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapy Patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either Levosimendan or placebo&#xD;
      (i.e. two patients assigned Levosimendan for every one patient assigned placebo) as an&#xD;
      intermittent dosing (every two weeks) by a 6-hour intravenous infusion (0.2 μg / kg / min&#xD;
      without bolus) for a period of 12 weeks (6 cycles) in study patients with advanced chronic&#xD;
      heart failure.In case of hypotension (systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mmHg or &lt;100 mmHg with&#xD;
      symptoms) or clinical intolerance to the drug, the dose could be reduced to 0.01 μg /kg/min.&#xD;
      Furtherreduction to 0.05μg/kg/min or discontinuation of the drug waspossible if these adverse&#xD;
      effects persisted.Study treatment was administered during a maximum of 12 weeks in an&#xD;
      ambulatory administration setting that allowed non-invasive monitoring of vital signs. During&#xD;
      the first infusion, 24-hour ECG monitoring (either with ambulatory Holter monitoring or&#xD;
      telemetry) was required for safety evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the treatment period, patients were followed every 4 weeks for 12 additional weeks. At&#xD;
      the end of the study, patients were followed for a maximum of 12 months - i.e. the last visit&#xD;
      (vital status assessment)was performed 9 months after the last administration of study&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection Baseline information was obtained in stable patients without signs of fluid&#xD;
      overload or low-cardiac output after written informed consent. These data included medical&#xD;
      history, hospitalizations, relevant clinical and demographic information and physical&#xD;
      examination by means of direct interview, examination and medical record review and included&#xD;
      NYHA class, most recent LVEF, medical therapy and 12-lead ECG. These data, including the&#xD;
      occurrence of adverse events and hospitalizations was re-evaluated every two weeks the first&#xD;
      3 months and every 4 weeks the next 3 months. Additional evaluations at baseline included&#xD;
      self-assessment of patient reported outcomes (PRO, including health-related quality of&#xD;
      life-HR-QoL- evaluated by means of the generic EQ-5D and the HF specific Kansas City&#xD;
      Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire, KCCQ), local laboratory measurements, and the distance walked&#xD;
      in the 6 minutes walking test (6MWT). PRO and 6 MWT were re-evaluated at week 13 and week 25.&#xD;
      Vital status assessment was also performed after 12 months of inclusion into the study.&#xD;
      Measurements of serum amino-terminal B-type pro-natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP, pg/mL) were&#xD;
      performed locally with and immunoassay based on chemiluminescence using the Elecsys System&#xD;
      (Roche®) before and 24 h after initiation of each study drug infusion (either Levosimendan or&#xD;
      placebo).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up and Evaluation of end-points The primary end-point of efficacy in the LION-HEART&#xD;
      study was to determine, relative to placebo, the effect of 6 cycles of ambulatory 6-hour&#xD;
      intravenous infusions of levosimendan every two weeks on concentrations of NT-proBNP&#xD;
      throughout the 12-week treatment period in patients with advanced chronic heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary End-points of safety and efficacy The secondary objectives for efficacy included&#xD;
      the evaluation of the effect of the drug compared to placebo on functional variables&#xD;
      including NYHA class, patient centered outcomes including HR-QoL, the relative change in&#xD;
      values of NT-proBNP from baseline to the end of treatment and unplanned hospitalizations (for&#xD;
      HF, for cardiovascular reasons and all-cause). As additional pre-specified efficacy&#xD;
      end-points the report of combined all-cause death or other terminal events (urgent LVAD or&#xD;
      heart transplant) with hospitalization was planned. The safety objectives aimed to evaluate&#xD;
      the effect of the study drug compared to placebo on all-cause mortality, changes in renal and&#xD;
      liver function. The impact of the administration of the study drug on heart rate and the risk&#xD;
      of development of life-threatening arrhythmias were investigated in all patients in our&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All adverse events, serious and non-serious were prospectively evaluated and recorded. Data&#xD;
      safety was regularly reviewed by medical personnel of the CRO without any contact with&#xD;
      investigators or patients on an ongoing basis according to the qualification of major events&#xD;
      (death, readmission) and other adverse events. Since allocation of patients to the study drug&#xD;
      or placebo was concealed, adjudication of adverse events and secondary efficacy&#xD;
      end-points(including death and hospitalizations) was undertaken by each local principal&#xD;
      investigator at each recruiting center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For efficacy, safety and tolerability evaluations, an intention to treat analysis was&#xD;
      undertaken in all patients that received at least one study drug infusion. Adverse events are&#xD;
      reported following the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MeDRA) definitions.&#xD;
