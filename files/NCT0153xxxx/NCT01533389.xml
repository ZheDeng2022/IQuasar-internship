      A lower ureteral calculus, which measures 5 millimeters and less, may be easily expelled by&#xD;
      symptomatic therapy. Actually, it has about a 50% chance of successful expulsion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, a complication such as urinary tract infection or hydronephrosis or persistent pain&#xD;
      may occur before it is expelled. Thus, it is imperative to minimize the occurrence of&#xD;
      complications in the process of expectant treatment and also to reduce the time required to&#xD;
      expel calculi.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacotherapy is to relieve ureteral obstruction and thus to expel urinary calculi easily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical trial is to evaluate the efficacy of silodosin, a selective α1A-blocker, on&#xD;
      calculous expulsion in expectant treatment for patients with lower and mid ureteral calculi.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lower and mid ureteral calculi, accounting for approximately 70% of ureteral calculi, has a&#xD;
      high chance of successful treatment thanks to ureteroscopic lithotripsy or extracorporeal&#xD;
      shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL)1-3), but at the same time have problems of postprocedural&#xD;
      complications and high expenses4). A lower ureteral calculus, which measures 5 millimeters&#xD;
      and less, may be easily expelled by symptomatic therapy. Actually, it has about a 50% chance&#xD;
      of successful expulsion5). However, a complication such as urinary tract infection or&#xD;
      hydronephrosis or persistent pain may occur before it is expelled. Thus, it is imperative to&#xD;
      minimize the occurrence of complications in the process of expectant treatment and also to&#xD;
      reduce the time required to expel calculi.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been recently reported that pharmacotherapy is adhibited to the expulsion of urinary&#xD;
      calculi and the relief of pain. The migration of ureteral calculi is influenced by both the&#xD;
      calculus and the ureter. In the case of the calculus, size, shape, number and location&#xD;
      influence it. In regard to the ureter, it is significantly influenced by the cramp of the&#xD;
      ureteral smooth muscle, the edema of the ureteral submucosa, the pain caused by the calculus&#xD;
      and the activities of adrenoreceptors6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacotherapy is to relieve ureteral obstruction and thus to expel urinary calculi easily.&#xD;
      Ureteral obstruction, caused by urinary calculi, obtunds ureteral peristalsis but strengthens&#xD;
      ureteral contraction, which may cause urinary retention or regurgitation7-8). In this&#xD;
      connection, studies have been conducted as to methods to reduce abnormal urinary reaction&#xD;
      caused by urinary calculi and to smoothen uroflow. Currently, hormone drugs including&#xD;
      hydroxyprogesterone, prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors, calcium-channel antagonists,&#xD;
      α1-blockers and steroid drugs are used to expel urinary calculi and to suppress pain. The&#xD;
      guidelines on urinary calculi, drawn up in 2007, recommend using α-blockers as they are&#xD;
      superior to other drugs in efficacy9-12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drug to be used in this clinical trial, silodosin, was registered under the proprietary&#xD;
      name of 'THRUPAS® Capsule 4mg' and is being marketed after being authorized by Korea Food and&#xD;
      Drug Administration (FDA), which selectively acts on the α1A-adrenoreceptor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical trial is to evaluate the efficacy of silodosin, a selective α1A-blocker, on&#xD;
      calculous expulsion in expectant treatment for patients with lower and mid ureteral calculi.&#xD;
