  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - FdCyd (also called 5-fluoro-2'-deoxycytidine) and THU (also called tetrahydrouridine) are&#xD;
      experimental cancer treatment drugs. FdCyd may change how genes work in cancer cells. THU&#xD;
      helps keep FdCyd from being broken down by the body. FdCyd and THU have been given to people&#xD;
      on other cancer treatment trials, usually by vein. Researchers want to give FdCyd and THU by&#xD;
      mouth to see if they work against cancers that have not responded to earlier treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To test oral FdCyd and THU on advanced solid tumors that have not responded to earlier&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have advanced solid tumors that have not responded&#xD;
      to standard treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine&#xD;
           samples will be collected. Imaging studies and tumor samples will used to study the&#xD;
           cancer before treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  FdCyd and THU will be given in 21-day cycles. THU should be taken 30 minutes before&#xD;
           taking FdCyd.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will take FdCyd and THU by mouth, once a day, for 3 days at the beginning&#xD;
           of the first and second weeks of each cycle (days 1 3 and 8 10). The drugs will not be&#xD;
           taken during the entire third week of each cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment will be monitored with frequent blood tests and imaging studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment will continue as long as the cancer is responding to the drugs and serious&#xD;
           side effects do not develop.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  5-Fluoro-2-deoxycytidine (FdCyd), a fluoropyrimidine nucleoside analog, has a short&#xD;
           (10-minute) half-life and is rapidly degraded in vivo by cytidine deaminase. However,&#xD;
           coadministration with tetrahydrouridine (THU), an inhibitor of cytidine/deoxycytidine&#xD;
           deaminase, has been shown to increase the AUC of the parent compound more than 4-fold.&#xD;
           Increased FdCyd exposure allows it to be taken up intracellularly and converted to its&#xD;
           triphosphate, which is incorporated into DNA and inhibits the action of the enzyme DNA&#xD;
           methyltransferase (DNMT). Inhibition of DNMT, and in turn DNA methylation, can result in&#xD;
           the re-expression of tumor suppressor genes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intravenous FdCyd with THU has been evaluated in a Phase I clinical trial with some&#xD;
           preliminary evidence of activity. This trial will investigate oral administration of the&#xD;
           drugs, which was shown to be feasible in an expansion cohort of the previous trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Establish the safety and tolerability of oral FdCyd in combination with oral THU&#xD;
      administered on an intermittent schedule in 21-day cycles to patients with refractory solid&#xD;
      tumors&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of oral FdCyd and oral THU&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Document preliminary evidence of activity of oral FdCyd and oral THU&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine effect of study treatment on re-expression of p16 and other select genes&#xD;
           silenced by methylation in circulating tumor cells and tumor biopsies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the effect of study treatment on DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase 1 and 3&#xD;
           (DNMT1 and DNMT3) expression in tumor biopsies&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Adults with histologically documented solid tumors whose disease has progressed after at&#xD;
      least one line of standard therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a multicenter trial with NCI as the coordinating center.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  FdCyd and THU will be administered on an intermittent schedule in 21-day cycles. THU&#xD;
           will be administered orally at a fixed dose of 3000 mg 30 minutes prior to FdCyd.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The trial will follow a standard Phase I dose escalation design (3-6 patients per&#xD;
           cohort).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Consideration will be given to increasing the days of administration of FdCyd with THU&#xD;
           after a target maximum plasma concentration of FdCyd is reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urine for pharmacokinetic studies will be obtained from all patients. Blood&#xD;
           for pharmacodynamic studies will be obtained after we achieve a target Cmax of 1microM.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Up to 25 patients will be enrolled in the expansion cohort, from which mandatory pre-&#xD;
           and post-dose tumor biopsies will be collected for the assessment of pharmacodynamic&#xD;
           endpoints, at dose level 8 (160 mg FdCyd+3000 mg THU 1x daily days 1-6 days week 1, days&#xD;
           8-13 week 2, in 21-day cycles)&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histologically documented solid tumors whose disease has progressed&#xD;
             on standard therapy that is known to be associated with a survival advantage or have&#xD;
             disease for which there is no known standard therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have measurable or evaluable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of malignancy must be confirmed by the department of pathology at the&#xD;
             institution where the patient is being enrolled prior to patient enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have completed any chemotherapy, radiation therapy, biologic therapy, or&#xD;
             major surgery greater than or equal to 4 weeks prior to enrollment (6 weeks for&#xD;
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C). Patients must be greater than or equal to 2 weeks since&#xD;
             any prior administration of a study drug in a Phase 0 or equivalent study, at the&#xD;
             discretion of the Principal Investigator. Patients must have recovered to eligibility&#xD;
             levels from prior toxicity or adverse events. Patients with bone metastases or&#xD;
             hypercalcemia on IV bisphosphonate treatment prior to study entry may continue this&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age greater than or equal to18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are&#xD;
             currently available on the use of FdCyd and THU in patients less than 18 years of age,&#xD;
             children are excluded from this study, but may be eligible for future pediatric Phase&#xD;
             I combination trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Karnofsky performance status greater than or equal to 60%.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of greater than 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to 1,500/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  platelets greater than or equal to 100,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  total bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 X institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) greater than or equal to 3 X institutional upper limit of&#xD;
                  normal&#xD;
&#xD;

             levels above 1.5 X institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Because FdCyd has been shown to be teratogenic in animals, pregnant women are&#xD;
                  excluded from this trial. Nursing women are also excluded, as there is an unknown&#xD;
                  but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment&#xD;
                  of the mother with FdCyd. Women of childbearing potential must agree to either&#xD;
                  abstain from sexual intercourse or use two forms of acceptable birth control,&#xD;
                  including one barrier method, for 4 weeks prior to study entry, for the duration&#xD;
                  of study participation, and for 3 months after completion of study. Men must use&#xD;
                  a latex condom every time they have sexual intercourse during therapy and for 3&#xD;
                  months after study completion, even if they have had a successful vasectomy.&#xD;
                  Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her&#xD;
                  partner is participating in this study, she or her partner should inform the&#xD;
                  treating physician immediately.&#xD;

                  skin or H &amp; N lesions under visualization) and willingness to undergo a tumor&#xD;
                  biopsy or patient will be undergoing a procedure due to medical necessity during&#xD;
                  which the tissue may be collected, or tumor biopsy tissue from a previous&#xD;
                  research study or medical care is available for submission at registration.&#xD;
                  Criteria for the submission of tissue are:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Tissue must have been collected within 3 months prior to registration&#xD;
