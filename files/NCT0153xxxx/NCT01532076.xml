  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Failure rates of up to 30% are reported after proximal humeral fractures despite&#xD;
      angular-stable devices. This may devastate not only the functional outcome but also the&#xD;
      independence of elderly patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To increase bone mineral density and thereby holding-strength augmentation is an option.&#xD;
      Autologous bone-graft, as current gold-standard, though is questionable in osteoporosis since&#xD;
      osteoprogenitors are dysfunctional and the harvesting-morbidity considerable. Adipose tissue&#xD;
      seems an alternative cell-source even in presence of osteoporosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cells isolated from lipoaspirates display osteogenic and&#xD;
      vasculogenic potential and can be harvested in high numbers. Expansion associated with costly&#xD;
      good-manufacturers-practice facilities is avoidable, so are repeated interventions. These&#xD;
      cells have been successfully used to generate osteogenic composite grafts with intrinsic&#xD;
      vascularity in preclinical models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For translation into clinical practice after a 20 patient external pilot a prospective&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial with 270 patients is planned. For the trial lipoaspiration&#xD;
      precedes open reduction and internal fixation in individuals over 60 years presenting with a&#xD;
      proximal humeral fracture after low-energy trauma. Cells are isolated (Cellution®800/CRS) and&#xD;
      wrapped around hydroxyapatite microgranules after embedding in a fibrin-gel for augmentation&#xD;
      of the typical bone-void. Clinical/radiological follow-up is at 6 and 12 weeks for immediate&#xD;
      complications and after 6, 9 and 12 months. Functional assessment is performed after 6 weeks,&#xD;
      6 and 12 months using the Quick-Dash- and Constant-Score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is a reduction in secondary dislocation by 50% during the first&#xD;
      postoperative year. Secondary dislocation is diagnosed on plain radiographs by an independent&#xD;
      board certified radiologist specialised in musculoskeletal imaging if one or more of the&#xD;
      following criteria are met:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  More than 20° varus collapse of the humeral head fragment in relation to the humeral&#xD;
           shaft&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screw penetration through the humeral head&#xD;
