  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study aims at measuring unbound voriconazole concentrations in plasma and at the&#xD;
      relevant target site of systemic fungal infections, i.e. the interstitial space fluid of soft&#xD;
      tissues, to assess the target site pharmacokinetics. For this purpose the microdialysis&#xD;
      technique will be employed which is capable of measuring the unbound, microbiologically&#xD;
      active concentration of antifungals in the interstitial space fluid of virtually all tissues.&#xD;
      This is the first human study of this drug employing the microdialysis technique determining&#xD;
      the target site concentrations over several days (single and multiple dosing).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Voriconazole, a derivative of fluconazole, is one of the newer triazole antifungal agents&#xD;
      launched in 2002. It has demonstrated favourable activity against primary opportunistic&#xD;
      fungal pathogens (Aspergillus spp., Candida spp. and Cryptococcus spp.), common dermatophytes&#xD;
      and the fungi which cause endemic mycoses. Voriconazole was approved for primary treatment of&#xD;
      acute invasive aspergillosis, candidiasis and salvage therapy for rare but serious fungal&#xD;
      infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antifungals such as voriconazole should display their pharmacodynamic activity in tissue,&#xD;
      more precisely in interstitial space fluid (ISF) of tissue, because this is the site where&#xD;
      most of the fungal pathogens are considered to reside. Microdialysis is a novel approach for&#xD;
      determination of drug concentration in virtually all tissues and has been used in vivo in&#xD;
      animal experiments since 1980s and for about 10 years in human studies. The advantages of&#xD;
      this technique are that it is easy to handle and reduces the burden on the patient to a&#xD;
      minimum because no tissue extraction is necessary. Microdialysis allows a continuous&#xD;
      determination of tissue drug concentrations over a defined time interval. In addition this&#xD;
      technique enables to determine only the unbound, i.e. pharmacodynamically active fraction of&#xD;
      the extracellular drug concentration at the site of action.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most pharmacokinetic (PK) data of voriconazole have only been obtained after single dose and&#xD;
      only in plasma (bound and unbound concentration). Regarding the pharmacodynamic activity it&#xD;
      is more appropriate to determine the unbound concentration at the target site. The novel&#xD;
      microdialysis technique allows to evaluate the concentration of voriconazole in subcutaneous&#xD;
      interstitial fluid of tissue (unbound concentration), the compartment where most of the&#xD;
      pathogens are considered to reside. Apart from multiple i.v. administration of voriconazole,&#xD;
      sequence therapy has been introduced, i.e. a switch from direct administration into the&#xD;
      systemic circu¬lation to an absorption based administration process, introducing further&#xD;
      variability on the PK. A further important reason for assessing voriconazole concentrations&#xD;
      during sequence therapy is that the i.v. dose is normalised to body weight but the oral dose&#xD;
      is given independently of this demographic dimension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims at determining unbound voriconazole concentrations in plasma and at the&#xD;
      relevant target site of systemic fungal infections, i.e. the interstitial space fluid of soft&#xD;
      tissues. Additionally, the PK of voriconazole after single and multiple i.v. and p.o. dosing&#xD;
      will be characterised and influencing parameters on the PK will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The design will be a prospective, two part, open-labelled, uncontrolled, study. For this&#xD;
      exploratory study no blinding procedure will be performed. Due to the nature of the study,&#xD;
      there will be no placebo or comparator arm. The pharmacokinetics will be compared between&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2 dosing schedules: after single and after multiple dosing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2 sampled matrices: plasma and microdialysate&#xD;
