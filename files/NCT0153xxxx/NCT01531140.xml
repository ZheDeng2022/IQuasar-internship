      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Polyethylene glycol (PEG) solution has been proven to be effective for large bowel cleansing&#xD;
      prior to colonoscopy in children. However, the high volume of fluid and its taste sometimes&#xD;
      lead to inappropriate cleansing of the bowel, thus search for other bowel preparation is&#xD;
      needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy and tolerability of three different bowel cleansing protocols used in children&#xD;
      for colonoscopy: high-volume PEG compared with low-volume PEG with stimulant laxative&#xD;
      (bisacodyl) compared with sennosides.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants aged 10-18 years will be randomly assigned to receive either PEG 60 ml/kg/day or&#xD;
      PEG 30 ml/kg/day plus oral bisacodyl 10-15 mg/day or sennosides 2mg/kg/day for 2 days prior&#xD;
      to the colonoscopy. The outcome measures will be:bowel cleansing efficacy, scored by a&#xD;
      blinded endoscopist using the Ottawa scale and Aronchick Scale (the mean total score,&#xD;
      proportions of participants with excellent/good and with poor/inadequate bowel preparation),&#xD;
      and the patient satisfaction score(0-10)with the method of preparation for the colonoscopy&#xD;
      evaluated with the visual analog scale. Analysis will be done on an intention to treat basis.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients are excluded if they had known allergy to one of the tested preparations such as&#xD;
      bisacodyl (Bisacodyl VP, ICN Polfa, Rzeszow, Poland), polyethylene glycol (Fortrans, Beaufour&#xD;
      Ipsen Industry, Dreux, France) and/or sennoside (Xenna Extra, US Pharmacia, Wroclaw, Poland)&#xD;
      and had disorders that make oral intake of the preparation impossible (neurological&#xD;
      disorders, intestinal obstruction, mental retardation etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On admission day patients are allocated to one of the groups by study investigators,&#xD;
      according to the randomization list created by an independent person using block&#xD;
      randomization by a standard statistical program StatsDirect [version 2,3,8 (2005)] (6&#xD;
      patients were included in each block).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the preparation for colonoscopy each patient are observed for procedure tolerance. On&#xD;
      the day of endoscopy, each patient evaluated the degree of the acceptance of the method of&#xD;
      bowel cleaning (according to visual analog scale (VAS) and the occurrence of side effects&#xD;
      (diary). The endoscopist performing colonoscopy, blinded for the bowel preparation regimen&#xD;
      evaluate bowel cleansing and score it, according to the Aronchick and Ottawa scale. The rate&#xD;
      of cecum intubation, and the colonoscopy complications (defined as bowel perforation and/or&#xD;
      significant bleeding) are analyzed in each bowel preparation group.&#xD;
