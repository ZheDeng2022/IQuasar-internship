    <textblock>
      Class II malocclusion (mismatch between the upper and lower jaw in which the lower jaw&#xD;
      appears to be smaller from a profile point of view) are common in the general population.&#xD;
      Around 1/3 of the population have some degree of this skeletal/dental problem and it is one&#xD;
      frequent reason why patients decide to undergo orthodontic treatment. Treatment alternatives&#xD;
      will basically depend on the facial skeletal development of the patient and also on the&#xD;
      magnitude of the skeletal/dental discrepancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients that are not yet fully skeletal mature, the treatment of mild to moderate Class&#xD;
      II malocclusion involves a combination of a small skeletal growth modification effect and&#xD;
      more significant dental movements. For skeletal mature individuals with a severe mismatch,&#xD;
      the treatment usually involves jaw surgery to fully correct the malocclusion. For less severe&#xD;
      cases orthodontic camouflage exclusively done by orthodontic movements is an option.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the case is not severe enough to warrant a surgical approach there are several treatment&#xD;
      alternatives. One of the most commonly used options is the use of orthodontic loaded springs&#xD;
      that apply forces through brackets and arch wires bonded into the teeth so that the teeth&#xD;
      will interrelate better.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A different alternative was proposed some years ago. The Xbow (spelled Crossbow) appliance&#xD;
      differs from the above-proposed option in that no brackets are bonded or arch wires used. The&#xD;
      orthodontic springs are applied to a metal framework cemented on some upper and lower teeth.&#xD;
      Once the skeletal/dental problem is believed to have been significantly improved, fine tuning&#xD;
      of the remaining dental problems is managed with brackets and arch wires. The theoretical&#xD;
      advantage of such a design is that adverse effects, such as root resorption and&#xD;
      decalcification from the long-term use of brackets and arch wires, are theoretically&#xD;
      minimized as the brackets and arch wires have to be used for a shorter period of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although there are some retrospective reports about the skeletal and dental effects of the&#xD;
      Xbow appliance and only one prospective trial comparing the skeletal and dental changes to a&#xD;
      non-treated growing sample; no randomized clinical trial has yet evaluated the changes&#xD;
      compared to a current standard of care alternative which is the simultaneous use of loaded&#xD;
      springs concurrent with brackets and arch wires.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Class II malocclusion is a common orthodontic problem that requires comprehensive treatment&#xD;
      planning. Treatment of Class II malocclusion is frequently initiated in mid to late mixed&#xD;
      dentition whereby crowding and/or an increased over jet becomes alarming to patients and&#xD;
      parents. Earlier correction of Class II abnormalities could be suggested in patients with&#xD;
      significant occlusion discrepancies, increased risk of trauma to protruding upper incisors&#xD;
      and impairment of mastication functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the available Class II correctors, cemented/fixed options are gaining popularity.&#xD;
      Systematic reviews have shed some light on what fixed Class II correction devices appear to&#xD;
      produce during treatment of mild to moderate Class II malocclusion. Short-term changes were a&#xD;
      combination of skeletal and dental modifications. Skeletal modifications include both&#xD;
      maxillary restriction and mandibular repositioning, and dental effects usually consist of&#xD;
      inclination of mandibular incisors and maxillary molar distal movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cephalometric analysis is a valuable tool used for diagnosis and treatment planning for&#xD;
      dental malocclusion and underlying skeletal discrepancies. In view of the fact that a&#xD;
      malocclusion is a product of an interaction between the alignment of the erupting teeth in&#xD;
      their basal bone and the skeletal position of the basal bone itself, cephalometric analysis&#xD;
      are used to evaluate dentoalveolar proportions and elucidate the anatomic basis for both jaw&#xD;
      and tooth related abnormalities in the sagittal plane.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Xbow appliance is a recently introduced orthodontic device that is used in late mixed or&#xD;
      early permanent dentition before full fixed orthodontic treatment is initiated. Its main goal&#xD;
      is to rapidly correct/improve the occlusion in a Class II malocclusion in mild to moderate&#xD;
      cases. Full brackets thereafter will fine-tune the final occlusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since its introduction there have been only three published studies of the Xbow appliance.&#xD;
      One study focused on the evaluation of short-term skeletal and dental effects from lateral&#xD;
      cephalograms while another discussed lower incisor inclination according to vertical facial&#xD;
      types. Both reported mandibular incisor inclination of variable magnitude. The last published&#xD;
      study analyzed if any conventionally utilized cephalometric variable was able to predict the&#xD;
      amount of lower incisor inclination consistently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As mentioned above, although the are some retrospective reports about the skeletal and dental&#xD;
      effects of the Xbow appliance and only one pilot prospective trial comparing the skeletal and&#xD;
      dental changes to a non-treated growing sample; no randomized clinical trial has yet&#xD;
      evaluated the changes compared to a current standard of care alternative which is the&#xD;
      simultaneous use of loaded springs concurrent with brackets and arch wires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study compares 3D facial, skeletal and dental changes using two orthopedic&#xD;
      orthodontic approaches. Group 1 (alternative treatment) will use a fixed Class II corrector -&#xD;
      Crossbow appliance - with full braces utilized later against Group 2 (one of the current&#xD;
      available conventional treatments) with full fixed appliances with an additional fixed Class&#xD;
      II corrector - (standard of care) - in clinical patients with mild to moderate Class II&#xD;
      division 1 malocclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An additional objective is to compare the adverse effects (root resorption and enamel&#xD;
      decalcification) among both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will undergo orthodontic clinical screening to determine if they fill the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria (mild to moderate Class II malocclusion in a growing individual). Eligible&#xD;
      candidates will be approached with an opportunity to participate in the research study. After&#xD;
      understanding the research purpose and possible side effects, and they choose to participate,&#xD;
      they will voluntarily sign the informed consent form. They will be randomly assigned to one&#xD;
      of two groups. The researchers will not participate in the randomization as it would be done&#xD;
      by a statistician and only communicated by phone once a participant is deemed to have&#xD;
      fulfilled the inclusion criteria and provided informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both treatment arms will start as soon as the randomization has been done. Full orthodontic&#xD;
      records (digital volumetric images - Cone Beam Computer Tomograms, photos and dental casts)&#xD;
      will be obtained for both groups at baseline and after treatment is completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 treatment will consist of fixed orthodontic appliances (brackets and molar tubes)&#xD;
      with the addition of the spring loaded orthodontic corrector once occlusion level and&#xD;
      alignment has been completed as per standard of care. It is expected that the treatment will&#xD;
      last around 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 treatment will consist of a fixed functional Crossbow appliance. Bands will be fitted&#xD;
      in the lower first molars, as well as in the upper first molars. A lingual and a vestibular&#xD;
      arch connecting the lower molar bands, as well as a Hyrax type rapid maxillary expansion&#xD;
      connecting the upper bands will be made in the laboratory. A Forsus spring will be connected&#xD;
      from a molar tube in the upper first molar to lower vestibular arch with adjustable Guerin&#xD;
      locks. It is expected that the Xbow treatment will be around 6 to 8 months. Fixed orthodontic&#xD;
      appliances (brackets and molar tubes) will be inserted thereafter and the regular orthodontic&#xD;
      treatment will be provided with an expected additional completion time of 12 to 16 months.&#xD;
      Therefore total treatment time will be in the 24-month range.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample of 50 patients (25 patients per treatment group, considering a 20% loss during&#xD;
      follow-up so that the groups will not have less than 21 patients per group at the end of&#xD;
      study) will be sought. Assumptions made were with a SD of 5 degrees of lower incisor&#xD;
      inclination, as averaged from previous studies, and a clinically significant difference of&#xD;
      also 5 degrees.&#xD;
