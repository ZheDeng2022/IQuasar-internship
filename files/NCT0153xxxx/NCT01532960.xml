  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite advances in surgical, radiation and medical therapies of early stage breast cancer,&#xD;
      some patients will experience disease recurrence. Because recurrence may not happen for years&#xD;
      after definitive treatment, there is a period of time between resection and relapse when&#xD;
      micrometastatic disease may be amenable to immune eradication or modulation. While the&#xD;
      ultimate goal of any cancer treatment is clinical efficacy, the immediate urgency in breast&#xD;
      immunotherapy is to define treatments that have immunologic efficacy. In this study, the&#xD;
      investigators will determine whether a vaccine consisting of nine-class I breast specific&#xD;
      peptides plus a class II tetanus toxoid helper peptide is immunogenic when administered with&#xD;
      poly-ICLC to participants with stage IB to IIIA breast cancer in the adjuvant setting.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a single arm, open label, pilot study of safety and immune efficacy of peptide&#xD;
      vaccination with poly-ICLC in patients with stage IB-IIIA resected breast cancer.&#xD;
      Participants will be patients who have completed their last dose/treatment of any single&#xD;
      treatment or combination of adjuvant surgery, radiation, chemotherapy or trastuzumab therapy&#xD;
      between 45 days and 6 months (180 days) prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each vaccination will be administered on days 1, 8, 15, 36, 57, and 78. All participants will&#xD;
      receive 9 class I MHC-restricted synthetic peptides (restricted by HLA-A1, -A2, -A3, or -A31)&#xD;
      and a class II MHC-restricted tetanus helper peptide mixed with 1mg poly-ICLC and&#xD;
      administered in sterile water. The vaccine will be administered intramuscular (IM) (1 ml) and&#xD;
      intradermally (ID) (1 ml) at vaccination sites in the arm and leg. (Each vaccine given IM and&#xD;
      ID at one site; site to alternate between arm site opposite the breast cancer and an anterior&#xD;
      thigh site.) Participants will be screened for HLA type and must be HLA-A1, -A2, -A3, or -A31&#xD;
      (80% of the Virginia population in prior studies1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Annual follow-up for progression and survival for 3 years after study withdrawal/completion.&#xD;
