  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  Lapatinib in combination with capecitabine has been approved for the treatment of women&#xD;
           with HER-2-positive advanced breast cancer that have progressed after anthracycline-,&#xD;
           taxane-, and trastuzumab-containing therapies. The use of this combination is limited by&#xD;
           overlapping toxicity such as diarrhea and cutaneous side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A significant number of patients receive today capecitabine with trastuzumab as first-&#xD;
           or second-line treatment. Therefore, other combinations of lapatinib with less toxic&#xD;
           cytotoxic agents are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eribulin mesylate (E7389) is a synthetic analog of Halichondrin B (HalB), a large&#xD;
           polyether macrolide isolated from a marine sponge. Eribulin is a mechanistically unique&#xD;
           antagonist of microtubule dynamics among tubulin-targeted agents, leading to inhibition&#xD;
           of microtubule growth in the absence of effects on microtubule shortening, and formation&#xD;
           of non- productive tubulin aggregates.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eribulin mesylate at a dose of 1.4 mg/m² given on day 1, 8 every 3 weeks has shown&#xD;
           better overall survival by 2.5 months compared to treatment of physicians choice in&#xD;
           patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who were previously treated&#xD;
           for 2-5 lines with anthracyclines, taxanes, and capecitabine (EMBRACE study).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The most frequently reported eribulin-related AEs were asthenia/fatigue (65%), alopecia&#xD;
           (60%), neutropenia (60%), nausea (44%), anemia (28%), pyrexia (23%), leucopenia (22%),&#xD;
           anorexia (21%), constipation (19%), vomiting (18%), and peripheral neuropathy (5.5%;&#xD;
           only grade 3). Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 32% of patients, and febrile neutropenia&#xD;
           occurred in 5.5% of patients. The frequency of all other grade 3/4 AEs was less than 3%.&#xD;
           This toxicity profile does not overlap with that of lapatinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There is uncertainty in how far a once every 3 week schedule of eribulin mesylate at a&#xD;
           dose of 2.0 mg/m² would be better tolerated. Several phase II studies are currently&#xD;
           conducted in various non-breast cancer indications to compare the d1+8 q d21 with a d1 q&#xD;
           d21 schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The aim of this randomized phase II study is to compare the efficacy and tolerability of&#xD;
           two dose-schedules of eribulin plus lapatinib in HER2-positive breast cancer,&#xD;
           pre-treated with trastuzumab in the adjuvant and/or metastatic setting.&#xD;

      Primary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the time to progression (TTP) of eribulin at a dose of 1.23 mg/m² IV days 1+8,&#xD;
           q 21 and eribulin given at a dose of 1.76 mg/m² IV day 1, q d21 both in combination with&#xD;
           lapatinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the safety and toxicity of both treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the objective response rate of both treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the overall clinical benefit rate (CR + PR + SD &gt;24 weeks) of both&#xD;
           treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine overall survival in both treatment arms 3 years after 1st patient has been&#xD;
           randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To assess biomarkers like PI3K mutation, PTEN expression, c-myc on the primary tumor and&#xD;
           correlate them with TTP in both treatment arms.&#xD;
