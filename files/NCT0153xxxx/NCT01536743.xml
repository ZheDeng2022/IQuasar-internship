      The purpose of this study is to obtain an estimate of the biochemical response rate as&#xD;
      determined by CA125 response using the Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup (GCIG) response criteria&#xD;
      of PD0332991 in patients with recurrent ovarian epithelial carcinoma. CA125 response is&#xD;
      defined as ≥ 50% decrease from the baseline CA125 level and confirmed ≥ 21 days after initial&#xD;
      evaluation (baseline is defined as the higher value of 2 pre-treatment CA125 assessments).&#xD;

             laboratory abnormality requiring further investigation that may cause undue risk for&#xD;
             the patient's safety, inhibit protocol participation, or interfere with interpretation&#xD;
             of trial results, and in the judgment of the investigator would make the patient&#xD;
             inappropriate for entry into this trial.&#xD;
