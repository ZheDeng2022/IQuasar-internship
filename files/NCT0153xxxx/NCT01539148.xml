  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigator is looking for patients who have been diagnosed with stage 1-4 cancer to&#xD;
      enroll in a five year Quality of Life clinical trial study in which the participant has&#xD;
      previously elected to use Insulin Potentiation Targeted Low Dose (IPTLD) as a means to treat&#xD;
      their illness. This study is a quality of life study and not a treatment study. Participants&#xD;
      participating in the study will be asked to complete quality of life questionnaires. The&#xD;
      questionnaires completed by the patients will measure mood, energy level, ability to&#xD;
      function, level of pain, and other measures that indicate how a patient feels about the&#xD;
      quality of their daily living.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will complete surveys once per month during their participation in the quality of&#xD;
      life study, and then a series of follow-up surveys: every two months the second year; every&#xD;
      three (3) months the third year and every six months the fourth and fifth year.&#xD;

        The study population will be from patients who have been diagnosed with stage 1-4 cancer&#xD;
        that have chosen to use IPTLD and nutritional therapy and have been referred by a&#xD;
        physician, word of mouth or through internet website inquiries.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Only patients in active treatment with IPTLD are eligible i.e. patients have consented&#xD;
             to treatment with IPTLD.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who are pregnant, or could become pregnant, may not participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients 18 years of age or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients have to be able and willing to complete the various QoL instruments, which&#xD;
             will be given upon enrollment and at designated follow-up intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have either had the benefits of standard, appropriate therapy and have&#xD;
             had that fail, or refuse to receive these therapies after having been informed of the&#xD;
             standard of care for their particular stage and diagnosis. This criteria is included&#xD;
             for ethical, not clinical reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In addition, other criteria may be developed that more specifically address: The type,&#xD;
             stage, location of the cancer/metastasis. The length of time since diagnosis. Previous&#xD;
             treatments attempted and their outcome, Length of time since last treatment and&#xD;
             concurrent conventional treatments. Nutritional approaches, other cam treatments,&#xD;
             factors that may confound the study results.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability, commitment of patient to follow IPTLD protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Best Answer for Cancer Foundation and Kotsanis Institute do intend to draw subjects&#xD;
             only from within the pool of patients who have elected to undergo IPTLD and nutrition&#xD;
             therapy as their treatment of choice; limiting the universe of subjects to IPTLD&#xD;
             patients removes the confounding effects of patient treatment choice and possible&#xD;
             consideration of other treatment arms from the design.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The focus is simple: it is to follow IPTLD patients and determine longitudinal impacts&#xD;
             of treatment on quality of life experienced by IPTLD patients as a treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  It is to allow comparison with well-documented QoL results from conventional&#xD;
             chemotherapy. This is the original intent, and recruitment efforts for participants&#xD;
             will remain within those who are IPTLD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The initial, baseline QoL testing of IPTLD patients who choose to be in the study will&#xD;
             include some questions designed to elicit the reasons the patient decided on IPTLD and&#xD;
             nutrition therapy. Documenting these choices can serve two purposes; correlations&#xD;
             between reasons, and the attitudes they reveal about factors known to impact QoL, such&#xD;
             a positive sense of controlling one's health choices, can be drawn. Further, once&#xD;
             these factors are accounted for, some inferences about the extent to which IPTLD and&#xD;
             nutrition therapy are responsible for impacts on QoL can be derived.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The Medical Director/Principal Investigator will consider excluding specific cancers,&#xD;
             for ethical reasons, that are intractable and known to have a rapid course, or which&#xD;
             are known to be unresponsive to IPTLD.&#xD;
