      The purpose of this study is to test if an 8-week mindfulness meditation training (vs a&#xD;
      wait-list control condition) program reduces neurobehavioral reactivity and improves affect&#xD;
      regulation in a sample of older adults, as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging.&#xD;
      Additionally, we will examine if mindfulness meditation training reduces loneliness and&#xD;
      markers of chronic inflammation.&#xD;

      It is well established that mindfulness meditation interventions improve a wide-range of&#xD;
      mental and physical health outcomes in stressed patient populations, although the underlying&#xD;
      mechanisms are currently unknown. It has been suggested that mindfulness training may reduce&#xD;
      reactivity to stimuli and improve regulation, although these mechanisms have not been&#xD;
      examined (using functional neuroimaging). Additionally, it is well-established that&#xD;
      loneliness and inflammation are major risk factors for morbidity and mortality in older&#xD;
      adults, although it is currently unknown whether mindfulness meditation training may reduce&#xD;
      these risk factors. The purpose of the proposed study is to test if mindfulness meditation&#xD;
      training (vs a wait-list control condition) reduces neurobehavioral reactivity and improves&#xD;
      affect regulation in a sample of healthy older adults, as measured by functional magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging. Additionally, we will examine whether mindfulness meditation training&#xD;
      reduces loneliness and markers of inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited in the Los Angeles area and randomly assigned to the 8-week&#xD;
      Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) intervention or to a wait-list. All participants&#xD;
      will provide a blood sample and complete a psychosocial survey before and after the&#xD;
      intervention, and complete a 60-minute neuroimaging assessment before and after the MBSR&#xD;
      program. All participants who are randomly assigned to the wait-list will be offered the MBSR&#xD;
      intervention after the 8-week intervention period and then complete an additional post-test&#xD;
      assessment after completing the MBSR program (which will include a blood sample, psychosocial&#xD;
      survey, and a neuroimaging assessment). Participants will complete neuroimaging tasks (where&#xD;
      they will be presented with words, pictures, and sounds) before and after receiving the MBSR&#xD;
      intervention, which will assess neural activity and regulation responses before and after&#xD;
      mindfulness meditation training.&#xD;
