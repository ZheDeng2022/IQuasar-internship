      The investigators will collect samples of sputum from healthy volunteers and patients with&#xD;
      cystic fibrosis for the purpose of: a) purifying airway mucins for plate-based binding&#xD;
      studies and; b) assessment of the effects of carbohydrates on the rheologic properties of the&#xD;
      sputum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has two hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Lectins from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Aspergillus fumigatus bind to airway mucins in a&#xD;
           fucose-dependent manner, and this binding can be inhibited by fucosyl glycomimetic&#xD;
           compounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Fucosyl glycomimetics will compete with Pseudomonas aeruginosa lectin (PA-IIL) and&#xD;
           Aspergillus fumigatus lectin (AFL) and disrupt lectin-driven mucin cross-linking in CF&#xD;
           sputum.&#xD;

      Pseudomonas lung infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality occurring in multiple&#xD;
      clinical settings. Patients with cystic fibrosis have lung colonization with Pseudomonas from&#xD;
      an early age, and overwhelming pseudomonal lung infection is the most common cause of death&#xD;
      in these patients. In addition, Pseudomonas pneumonia is common in immunocompromised patients&#xD;
      and in patients intubated for management of respiratory failure. Particularly worrisome is&#xD;
      the increasing frequency of P. aeruginosa isolates that are resistant to all or most&#xD;
      currently available antibiotics. The mechanism of virulence of P. aeruginosa includes soluble&#xD;
      lectins that recognize host oligosaccharides on mucins and the cell glycocalyx. P. aeruginosa&#xD;
      has two soluble lectins - LecA, also known as PA-IL and LecB, also known as PA-IIL. PA-IL&#xD;
      binds galactose and PA-IIL binds fucose. Notably, PA-IIL binds the fucose containing Lewis a&#xD;
      oligosaccharide with very high affinity and the role of PA-IIL in biofilm formation is shown&#xD;
      by the absence of biofilm formation in Pseudomonas mutants lacking PA-IIL and by the efficacy&#xD;
      of multivalent fucosyl-peptide dendrimers in preventing and disrupting Pseudomonas biofilm&#xD;
      formation. D-galactose and L-fucose have been successfully used to treat P. aeruginosa&#xD;
      infection in a case report, which hints at the potential for glycomimetic therapy in CF.&#xD;
      These monosaccharides are weak inhibitors of PA-IIL, however, and multivalent glycomimetics&#xD;
      will be needed for more effective inhibition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aspergillus fumigatusinfection is responsible for the majority of human and animal&#xD;
      aspergillosis disease, even though air sampling studies show that its conidia usually&#xD;
      comprise only a small percentage of total airborne fungal challenge. It is both a primary and&#xD;
      opportunistic pathogen, and it is particularly troublesome for patients with cystic fibrosis.&#xD;
      It causes multiple lung diseases, includingchronic pulmonary aspergillosis, allergic&#xD;
      bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, and invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. Aspergillomas also&#xD;
      occur in patients with cavitary lung diseases. Together, these diseases cause significant&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality, and available treatments are suboptimal. Most patients with chronic&#xD;
      pulmonary aspergillosis require antifungal therapy for many months or years, many experience&#xD;
      significant drug side effects, and some experience drug resistance. Patients with either&#xD;
      allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) or severe asthma with fungal sensitization can&#xD;
      improve with itraconazole treatment, but relapses are common, and itraconazole affects&#xD;
      corticosteroid metabolism and has the potential to worsen steroid side effects. ABPA requires&#xD;
      long-term treatment because Aspergillus airway colonization is difficult to eradicate and&#xD;
      quickly recurs when treatment is stopped. Immunocompromised patients are especially&#xD;
      vulnerable to invasive aspergillosis where the mortality rate is often 50%, even with&#xD;
      antifungal treatment. Clearly, therefore, new treatment approaches are needed for lung&#xD;
      diseases caused by A. fumigatus, and we are proposing an approach based on prevention of&#xD;
      binding to airway mucins. Adherence of A. fumigatus conidia to host tissues has been the&#xD;
      subject of extensive research, but little attention has been directed to Aspergillus/mucin&#xD;
      interactions, a surprising deficiency given the role mucins play in airway biology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is an ex-vivo study in which we will collect samples of sputum from healthy&#xD;
      volunteers and patients with cystic fibrosis for the purpose of: a) purifying airway mucins&#xD;
      for plate-based binding studies and; b) ex-vivo assessment of the effects of carbohydrates on&#xD;
      the rheologic properties of the sputum.&#xD;
