      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hysteroscopic morcellator (HM) is a novel technique for removal of intrauterine polyps,&#xD;
      myomas and placental tissue. It withholds some technical advantages over resectoscopy.&#xD;
      Previous data suggest that it's a faster technique than the latter, and shows that it has a&#xD;
      low complication rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the HM to bipolar resectoscopy for removal of:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) large intrauterine polyps, 2) smaller type 0 and 1 myomas, 3) residual placental tissue,&#xD;
      in terms of efficiency and complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Single blind, randomized controlled multicenter trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Women aged over 18 years old with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) large (≥ 1 cm) intrauterine polyps, 2) smaller (≤ 3 cm) type 0 or 1 myomas, 3) residual&#xD;
      placental tissue, who are planned for hysteroscopic removal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are randomized between removal with the HM or the bipolar resectoscope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Installation and operating time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women who are referred to our polyclinic will be seen on a first visit, and, according to the&#xD;
      standard work-up, an ultrasound will be performed when intrauterine pathology is suspected.&#xD;
      To confirm the diagnosis a saline infusion sonography (SIS) and/or ambulant diagnostic&#xD;
      hysteroscopy will be performed consequently. Once the diagnosis is confirmed and surgery is&#xD;
      planned, women will be asked whether they want to take part in this study. At this moment,&#xD;
      both techniques are used in our hospitals and the choice of treatment depends on the&#xD;
      preference of the gynaecologist. All women will be treated with operative hysteroscopy in a&#xD;
      daycare setting according to the standard of care, only now randomized between the two&#xD;
      techniques. A standard postoperative visit with ultrasound examination and/or ambulant&#xD;
      diagnostic hysteroscopy is scheduled 6 weeks later. Late postoperative complications and&#xD;
      complaints are recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that the HM beholds some advantages over the bipolar resectoscope such as&#xD;
      shorter operating time and less complications (e.g. risk of perforation, current and fluid&#xD;
      related complications). Previous data do not demonstrate any additional risks related to the&#xD;
      use of the HM. Moreover we will check whether the HM has a lower risk of intrauterine&#xD;
      adhesion formation, as this might influence patient's fertility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of the RCT, an observational study is planned considering pregnancies&#xD;
      subsequent to the hysteroscopic procedure.&#xD;

    <description>Morcellation will be performed with the HM (TRUCLEAR, Smith &amp; Nephew, Andover, USA). The rotary blade is used for polypectomy and removal of residual placental tissue; the reciprocating blade is used for myomectomy. The blade has a window-opening at the end with cutting edges through which tissue is aspirated by means of a vacuum source. The removed tissue is discharged through the device, collected in a pouch and made available for pathology analysis.</description>

    <description>Resectoscopy will be performed with a rigid 8.5 mm bipolar resectoscope (Karl Storz GmbH, Tuttlingen, Germany), equipped with a 0 or 30 degree optic. Normal saline is used for distension and irrigation of the uterine cavity. Fluid balance is closely monitored using a Hystero pump (Richard Wolf GmbH, Knittlingen, Germany) or Hysteromat pump (Karl Storz GmbH, Tuttlingen, Germany).</description>
