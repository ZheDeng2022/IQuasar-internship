      The aim of the project was to optimalize the process in severe peritonitis which is generally&#xD;
      inflicted with high mortality and morbidity with long term costly therapy. Therapy of severe&#xD;
      intraabdominal infection consist of treatment of the infection site and following closure of&#xD;
      the abdominal cavity with possibility of re-laparotomy and in treatment of complications when&#xD;
      needed; or closure introduction of laparostomy with intention to control complications&#xD;
      prevention however with risk of tertiary peritonitis. Modern process is laparostomy with&#xD;
      active suction (VAC) method which reduces the risk of tertiary peritonitis. It efficacy is&#xD;
      however approved especially in therapy of complications. Based on the investigators&#xD;
      experiences the investigators use this method even in case of primary treatment of severe&#xD;
      peritonitis which led to protocol processing (VAC in case of primary closure of the abdominal&#xD;
      cavity; VAC exchange according to scoring system; secondary closure of the abdominal cavity&#xD;
      or early coverage with collagen mesh). The aim of this project is to prove reduced mortality,&#xD;
      morbidity and hospitalization length (cost reduction) in prospective randomized study in&#xD;
      patients treated due to severe peritonitis using VAC method in comparison to classical&#xD;
      approach (primary closure of the abdominal cavity; secondary solution of complications).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Introduction Severe peritonitis belongs among severe diseases with mortality 20-60%. Causes&#xD;
      are number of primary surgical diseases (inflammatory acute abdomen syndromes - perforated&#xD;
      diverticulitis, perforated tumor, colon ischemia and other) or complications after abdominal&#xD;
      surgeries in frequency 12-16%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary and tertiary peritonitis can be in insult causing system inflammatory response&#xD;
      (SIRS) with subsequent sepsis and multi-organ failure; it is serious state of patient who&#xD;
      requires long term and costly intensive care and despite of that it often ends with permanent&#xD;
      disability. Basic therapy of severe peritonitis is surgical treatment of origin of abdominal&#xD;
      sepsis, contamination elimination and prevention of postoperative complications. The&#xD;
      insufficient capability to manage postoperative complications (polymorbidity, diabetes,&#xD;
      inveterate peritonitis, immunosuppressed patient) is often the cause of organ and mutli-organ&#xD;
      failure. In case of primary closure of the abdominal cavity and after correct surgical&#xD;
      treatment; solution is the early diagnosis of the complications and their urgent sanitation.&#xD;
      Mostly from objective reasons there is delay in complication diagnosis and thus adequate&#xD;
      treatment. Other negative consequence of primary closure of the abdominal cavity in case of&#xD;
      development of intraabdominal complicated healing is the development of intraabaominal&#xD;
      hypertension and even compartment syndrome with all negative influences to organ functions.&#xD;
      Alternative is to introduce laparostomy which enables simple abdominal cavity control (second&#xD;
      look method) using repeated interventions. Classical laparostomy is however continual&#xD;
      continuation of the tertiary contamination. According to known literal sources there is no&#xD;
      recommendation for means of abdominal cavity closure in the above given surgical disease&#xD;
      which is therapeutically more efficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the modern laparostomy methods is closure of the abdominal cavity using VAC. Method&#xD;
      principle is the active suction which is continual and it drains effusion from the abdominal&#xD;
      cavity and thus reduces intraabdominal bacterial contamination and also supports blood&#xD;
      circulation and vitality of the wound edges. It is a method which fulfills advantages of&#xD;
      laparotomy including expansion of the abdominal cavity, effusion drainage quality of which&#xD;
      can be controlled; it is a closed system in which there is no risk of external contamination&#xD;
      as in case of common laparostomy. Use of VAC method was verified in various wound types with&#xD;
      copious secretion (sternotomy, diabetic foot or fascitis). Method of VAC laparostomy was&#xD;
      described; however prospective and randomized use in peritonitis has not bee evaluated yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the project: The aim of this project is to prove reduced mortality, morbidity and&#xD;
      hospitalization length (cost reduction) in prospective randomized study in patients treated&#xD;
      due to severe peritonitis using VAC method in comparison to classical approach (primary&#xD;
      closure of the abdominal cavity; secondary solution of complications). Secondary aim is to&#xD;
      validate scoring systems and early sepsis markers (cytokines) in algorithm of assessment of&#xD;
      severance of severe peritonitis in our conditions and their inclusion in indication for&#xD;
      surgical revision. Tertiary aim is to determine group of patient who would profit the most&#xD;
      from the method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further aim is to compare costs and socio-economic implications of both therapy options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Primary introduction for surgical revision due to severe peritonitis reduces&#xD;
      postoperative morbidity and mortality in comparison with primary closure of the abdominal&#xD;
      cavity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indications for repeated intervention improves combination of scoring systems and&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
      1- assessment of preoperative stave of patient - APACHE II (Acute Physiology and Chronic&#xD;
      Health Evaluation, ASA, BMI), severity of clinical and surgical finding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2 - Assessment of influence of selected method primary treatment of the abdominal cavity on&#xD;
      the postoperative morbidity which is expressed by monitoring basic vital functions, SOFA&#xD;
      (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment), intraabdominal pressure monitoring, serum level of&#xD;
      cytokines monitoring, postoperative complications, surgical revision and length of&#xD;
      hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 - long term and socioeconomic consequence (30 days of follow up after discharge -&#xD;
      questionnaire, assessment of life quality), cost analysis expended for hospitalization&#xD;
      including medication, surgery as well as postoperative outpatient control visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient with severe peritonitis will be enrolled in study according to Mannheim Peritonitis&#xD;
      Index (MPI) - more than 20-25 according to sex; APACHE II more than 10. Expected sample size&#xD;
      is total of 50 patients (25 treated using VAC method) versus 25 in control group). Screening&#xD;
      will include all patients designer fulfilling SIRS criteria prior abdominal approach and/or&#xD;
      displaying symptoms of peritonitis. If patient fulfills these criteria and agrees with&#xD;
      inclusion in study, his/her ID is entered in the electronic database which generates&#xD;
      inclusion in one out of two groups according randomization scheme - surgery termination using&#xD;
      VAC method or primary suture. Excluded patients: young patients younger than 18 years; mental&#xD;
      state of patients which does not enable proper information and signature of informed consent&#xD;
      form (see bellow) with inclusion in study; further patients who cannot be assume to live&#xD;
      longer than 48 hours after surgery (APACHE II, Karnofski, SOFA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative care and actual surgical procedure is not the direct subject of study and will&#xD;
      be conducted according to so far known procedures. Surgeon will closed the abdominal cavity&#xD;
      according randomization at the end of procedure and this fact is in no way affected by actual&#xD;
      surgery procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient will be treated at the surgical ICU. First exchange of VAC dressing will be conducted&#xD;
      after 24-48 hours and subsequently so called on demand (patient health state aggravation&#xD;
      defined as score SOFA increase by 4 and more points; elevation of inflammatory markers and&#xD;
      interleukins). After complete sanitation of the origin the investigators close the&#xD;
      laparostomy (only serous exudate) If it is not technically possible to suture abdominal&#xD;
      cavity according to layers, the investigators will close it using following alternatives:&#xD;
      single skin cover, mesh plasty, covering with celless skin implant (permacol surgical&#xD;
      implant) so the abdominal cavity was closed as soon as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient with primary closed abdominal cavity (control group) will be treated according to so&#xD;
      far known procedure. In case of inflammation signs the investigators will search and treat&#xD;
      this focus. Cytokine inflammatory markers will be also monitored and including finding. In&#xD;
      case of surgical complication the investigators will proceed in standard manner (SSI). VAC&#xD;
      method will not be used in cases of those patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hospitalization will be terminated after criteria compliance which are: oral intake higher&#xD;
      than 2 liters tolerance; sufficient oral analgesics; patient does not display infection&#xD;
      signs; agrees with hospitalization; surgical wound is treatable in outpatient clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Means of data collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative examination will monitor apart from basic data such as age, diagnosis,&#xD;
      co-morbidity score ASA, BMI, level of inflammatory parameters (CRP, blood count, other&#xD;
      biochemistry examination). Patient must fulfill criteria SIRS to be enrolled in the study and&#xD;
      display signs of peritonitis. Precise indication to surgery will be recorded. After&#xD;
      introduction of anesthesia the investigators will perform examination of arterial blood&#xD;
      (ASTRUP) and will calculate APACHE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extent of inflammation (MPI) will be evaluated and source of infection (confirmation or&#xD;
      exclusion of preoperative diagnosis). Performed surgical procedure will be described, the&#xD;
      investigators will monitor duration of surgery; blood loss; monitoring whether sufficient&#xD;
      control of primary source (insufficient treatment of source is sufficient exclusion&#xD;
      criterion).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Daily the investigators will monitor IL-1, 6, 8, 10 and TNF alpha while at ICU (during first&#xD;
      5 days), SOFA score will be calculated and IAP will be measured. The investigators will&#xD;
      further monitor frequency of VAC exchanges; number of administrated transfusions; duration of&#xD;
      UPV; days without oral intake and without possibility of physiotherapy - walking (parameters&#xD;
      of recovery. Conscious patients will be submitted form for assessment of life quality (SF-36)&#xD;
      on the 7th postoperative day. The investigators will further monitor pain using VAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Entry values are: hospitalization length, number of ICU days; mean of wound closure (primary&#xD;
      suture, delayed suture after VAC; skin cover and other). Incidence and severity of SSI (I-III&#xD;
      grade) and further nosocomial infection (health care - associated infection - HAI). Patient&#xD;
      again completes from assessing life quality (SF-36) prior discharge. Active follow up will be&#xD;
      in terms of study conducted via telephone every 30th day after discharge. Patient will&#xD;
      subsequently complete mailed questionnaire with assessing life quality (SF-36). Outpatient&#xD;
      controls will be necessary and repeated hospitalization in complicated patients. After&#xD;
      completion of patient monitoring the analysis of cost for hospitalization including&#xD;
      medication, surgery and postoperative outpatient control will be conducted using the hospital&#xD;
      information system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical processing&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size is estimated based on expected percentage indicator according to Fleisse. Other&#xD;
      sample size estimates were estimated using standard method. Each sample must contain 26 -47&#xD;
      patients for mortality estimated between 30-40% and in case of statistically significant&#xD;
      difference 20-30% when 5% level of significance and test power 70% in case of one sided test.&#xD;
      Morbidity estimated to 60% and clinically significant difference 30-40% requires sample size&#xD;
      of 19-32 subjects providing the same significance level and one sided test. Statistical&#xD;
      evaluation of results will be included based on pair tests. Difference of individual&#xD;
      variables between both groups will be evaluated using Student pair test or its non-parametric&#xD;
      variant (Wilcoxon test). SOFA, APACHE II scores and life quality assessment results (SF-36)&#xD;
      will be evaluated using Hotelling test as multi directional generalization of Student test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time schedule:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. year of the project: design of randomization program; personal education with study&#xD;
           protocol; software design; inclusion of 18 patients. Data processing. Results will be&#xD;
           evaluated at the end of the year; statistician will evaluate homogeneity of groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. year of the project: inclusion of further 18 patients. Data analysis will be performed&#xD;
           and subgroup analysis and partial results will be processed and presented.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. year of the project: inclusion of the last 14 patients. Follow up termination. Definite&#xD;
           data collection, analysis, results evaluation including financial analysis. Standard&#xD;
           proposal. Presentation in national and international forums, publications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion Surgical treatment is inseparable part of patient care with severe peritonitis.&#xD;
      Advance monitoring is important for identification of risk patients but also for possible&#xD;
      surgical revision indication. Generally used sepsis markers including scoring systems (APACHE&#xD;
      II, MOSF - Multiple Organ System Failure, MODS - Multiple Organ Dysfunction Score) however&#xD;
      react with certain delay. Possible or on demand re-laparotomy is performed afterwards in&#xD;
      patient in severe conditions with MODS. On the other hand planned re-laparotomies are&#xD;
      conducted excessively. Not even met-analysis of clinical studies proved clear preference of&#xD;
      one procedure (23). New method VAC however has not been evaluated in prospective randomized&#xD;
      study in this indication. Inclusion of early markers of septic state - IL-1, 6, 8, 10 a TNF&#xD;
      alpha - in indication for re-laparotomy or VAC exchange could have large clinical benefit.&#xD;
      Further controversial indication parameter commonly measured at ICU is size and development&#xD;
      of IAP which can present important correlation with laboratory signs of inflammation and it&#xD;
      can lead for design of special index. VAC method use has its advantages - active and closed&#xD;
      intraabdominal secretion restricts possibilities of spreading HAI. Significant and reduced&#xD;
      frequency of dressing; enables simple physiotherapy of patients; condition of anabolic phase&#xD;
      which is necessary for any healing (24). Analysis of patient number which benefit from this&#xD;
      method (intention-to treat) against general costs is necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Designer's working site has treated 19 patients over the last 18 months using this method.&#xD;
      Mortality was 15.8% and average hospitalization length 59.2 days which is in compliance of so&#xD;
      far published results. However it has not been prospective randomized study and VAC method&#xD;
      was however used as the last therapeutic option.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information Working site has needed surgical equipment including equipment for performing of&#xD;
      VAC; VAC is used as method for 5 years; apart from purchase of consumption material he is the&#xD;
      only owner of the pump. This method has been used to treat different wounds. Principal&#xD;
      investigator and all co-workers has experience with this method. Co-investigator has even&#xD;
      numerous experiences with clinical studies and he published his results in journals. Other&#xD;
      specific equipment is not necessary for study procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion Detected results will background for verification of efficacy of VAC introduction&#xD;
      into laparostomy in patients after surgical revision due to severe peritonitis. Efficacy of&#xD;
      new and standard laboratory and clinical markers of septic state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results, aims, priorities and significance of the project Study output will consist&#xD;
      of data usable for design of recommended procedure for surgical patient care with severe&#xD;
      peritonitis. Standardized protocol will be introduced for ICU patients which reflect only&#xD;
      those laboratory methods and clinical parameters which clinically influence therapy. Detailed&#xD;
      analysis for both groups will enable precise indication single surgical interventions which&#xD;
      will ensure efficient and thus cost wise preferable therapy. Simple universal software will&#xD;
      be created in terms of study which manages patient database and thus enables rapid concurrent&#xD;
      assessment of health care quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With regard that similar complex prospective study has not been published in national and&#xD;
      international magazines, publication in impact journal; socioeconomic analysis will be&#xD;
      published especially in national medical journals so it would be easily accessible.&#xD;
