    <textblock>
      The aim of the trial is to test safety, tolerability and efficacy of Propionyl-L-carnitine&#xD;
      modified release tablets 1g/die in reducing the symptoms of the disease with respect to the&#xD;
      proportion of patients with disease remission at the end of the 8 weeks of treatment. It will&#xD;
      also aim to investigate capability of the treatment in the maintenance of remission after&#xD;
      four weeks of treatment interruption; histological changes will be also evaluated and&#xD;
      finally, improvement in the overall quality of life as measured by the Short Inflammatory&#xD;
      Bowel Disease Questionnaire (SIBDQ)will be investigated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although it seems clear that an abnormal function of the colonic epithelium is the central&#xD;
      problem causing inflammation and the unusual immunological response to the normal gut flora&#xD;
      in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the actual causes of these dysfunctions are still&#xD;
      unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Short Chain Fatty Acids (SCFA) are the main fuel of the colonic epithelium, and are normally&#xD;
      produced by the bacterial flora by fermentation of the complex carbohydrates forming non&#xD;
      soluble fibers usually introduced with everyday diet. Butyrate alone contributes 70% of the&#xD;
      normal colonocyte energy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies done using animal models and colonic mucosa biopsies from patients suffering form&#xD;
      ulcerative colitis (UC) have consistently shown that a metabolic change occurs in diseased&#xD;
      colonic mucosa, with an impairment of butyrate oxidation (and of beta-oxidation) and an&#xD;
      energy shortage that is only incompletely compensated by oxidation of glucose and other&#xD;
      substrates such as glutamine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is also well known that matrix metalloproteases production is highly increased in IBD and&#xD;
      that serum transglutaminase activity is significantly reduced in patients with IBD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transglutaminases are enzymes contributing to the crosslinking of matrix proteins and the&#xD;
      reduction seen in patients affected by IBD correlates well with the endoscopic and&#xD;
      histopathologic grading in UC, meaning that part of the circulating enzyme is sequestered in&#xD;
      the injured colonic tissue in the effort to re-build the extracellular matrix during the&#xD;
      healing process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Propionyl-L-carnitine Hydrochloride (PLC) is a molecule that has already been shown to reduce&#xD;
      membrane lipid peroxidation in endothelial cells from bovine aorta and coronary vessels, to&#xD;
      reduce the effects of hypoxia in coronary endothelial cells, and to play a role in the&#xD;
      cardiac metabolic abnormalities that contribute to the mechanical dysfunctions leading to&#xD;
      heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given these properties of Propionyl-L-carnitine Hydrochloride (ST 261) and given the&#xD;
      peroxidative damage suffered by colonocytes in UC together with their metabolic impairment,&#xD;
      the use of this molecule for the treatment of UC seemed to be appropriate and sound, in&#xD;
      particular as a carrier of a propionate moiety that, once transformed into succinate, enters&#xD;
      the Kreb cycle, acting as an extra burst fuel improving the balance of energy production&#xD;
      inside tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous clinical experience has shown that PLC promoted complete or nearly complete&#xD;
      regression of cutaneous trophic ulcers in a large number of vasculopathic patients refractory&#xD;
      to all other therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As far as the UC pathology is concerned, the effects of ST 261, given orally or&#xD;
      intrarectally, were investigated at different dosages, in preclinical experimentation, either&#xD;
      after a single trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid (TNBS) administration (acute colitis) or after&#xD;
      repeated TNBS administrations (reactivated colitis). The results showed a reduction in the&#xD;
      damaged colon area both in acute model and reactivated colitis, even if the beneficial effect&#xD;
      of restoration of TNBS-induced alterations of tissue morphology is more evident in the&#xD;
      reactivated colitis model, particularly after oral administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the above-described results a development plan in humans started to investigate the&#xD;
      activity of PLC in the treatment of ulcerative colitis.&#xD;
