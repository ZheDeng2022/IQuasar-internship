  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Childhood obesity is highly prevalent and is associated with both short- and long-term&#xD;
      adverse outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite availability of guidelines for nearly a decade and more recent comparative&#xD;
      effectiveness research (CER) evidence, the health care system has been slow to adopt&#xD;
      recommended practices. Although pediatric health care providers often cite barriers such as&#xD;
      limited time, skill, and resources, a frequently overlooked barrier is the lack of data&#xD;
      systems to efficiently and accurately assess guideline implementation and to improve quality&#xD;
      of care for childhood obesity. Health information technology (HIT) offers potential for&#xD;
      accelerating the adoption of CER evidence regarding childhood obesity screening and&#xD;
      management, for establishing treatment benchmarks, and for supporting patients and their&#xD;
      clinical teams in care improvement. Incorporation of HIT may be especially effective if&#xD;
      augmented by outreach to parents and children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to develop and test system-level interventions to accelerate the&#xD;
      adoption of CER evidence on childhood obesity screening and management, and ultimately&#xD;
      improve obesity-related health care quality and outcomes. To achieve this goal, the&#xD;
      investigators will work with two health care systems in Massachusetts with strong track&#xD;
      records of research collaboration: Cambridge Health Alliance (CHA), an integrated academic&#xD;
      public health system, and Harvard Vanguard Medical Associates (HVMA), a large multi-site&#xD;
      group practice. Both systems use an electronic medical record for all aspects of ambulatory&#xD;
      care, including point of care services such as electronic order entry and centralized&#xD;
      functions such as patient scheduling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In these settings of innovation and commitment to improving quality of care, the&#xD;
      investigators will develop and test two systematic strategies for adoption of CER evidence.&#xD;
      The first incorporates computerized point of care decision alerts to pediatric primary care&#xD;
      providers during routine office visits, linked to CER-based algorithms of care. The second&#xD;
      augments this HIT approach with direct-to-parent communication of child's body mass index&#xD;
      (BMI) along with recommended evaluation and management. The specific aims of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. In 18 community health centers of CHA, to identify barriers to and facilitators of&#xD;
           adoption of an existing set of computerized point of care decision alerts for childhood&#xD;
           obesity screening and management. The investigators will achieve this aim through&#xD;
           in-depth interviews and surveys with primary care clinicians, which will inform the&#xD;
           design of the investigators proposed intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. In 14 practices of HVMA, to conduct a cluster-randomized controlled trial to examine the&#xD;
           extent to which computerized point of care decision alerts to pediatric primary care&#xD;
           providers, with or without direct-to-parent communications, will increase adoption of&#xD;
           CER evidence on childhood obesity for children 6 to 12 years of age with a BMI ≥ 95th&#xD;
           percentile. The investigators will determine the extent to which each of the 2&#xD;
           intervention conditions, compared with the usual care control condition and with each&#xD;
           other, results in:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Increased screening and assessment of childhood obesity at the point of care,&#xD;
                including BMI, blood pressure, and laboratory screening, and provision of nutrition&#xD;
                and physical activity counseling,&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. A smaller age-associated increase in BMI over a 1-year period, and,&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Improved specific dietary, physical activity, and sedentary behaviors over a 1-year&#xD;
                period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate each intervention's costs (including clinician and family time) and&#xD;
           cost-effectiveness in terms of children's change in BMI and weight-related behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To develop a detailed dissemination guide to further accelerate adoption of CER evidence&#xD;
           on childhood obesity in practices and communities interested in implementing similar&#xD;
           interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve the investigators aims, the investigators have assembled a research team with&#xD;
      extensive experience in obesity prevention, clinician and child behavior change, clinical&#xD;
      informatics, statistical methodology in cluster randomized controlled trials,&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness analyses, and dissemination science. If successful, this project will&#xD;
      provide new and sustainable approaches for accelerating adoption of CER evidence for&#xD;
      childhood obesity screening and management and for improving quality of care for childhood&#xD;
      obesity in pediatric primary care.&#xD;
