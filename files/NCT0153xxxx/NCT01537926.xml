    <textblock>
      The purpose of the sudy is to conduct a small study to gather the preliminary data for future&#xD;
      lage scale clinical studies that will be designed test the potential beneficial effect of&#xD;
      over-the counter study anti-oxidant drug called N-acetylcysteine (NAC) in patients with a&#xD;
      heart muscle condition called Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM). The present study is a pilot&#xD;
      feasibility study, the investigators want to find out whether the investigators can recruit&#xD;
      and retain patients with HCM in the study and whether these patients can tolerate this drug&#xD;
      and can stay on one year. Likewise, the investigators want to find out any potential side&#xD;
      effects that this drug might have and estimate whether it has any beneficial effects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to perform a pilot study in patients with hypertrophic&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy (HCM) and mutations in genes encoding sarcomere proteins to assess safety and&#xD;
      gather the pre-requisite data for subsequent robust randomized placebo-controlled efficacy&#xD;
      studies with N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Data will be gathered on the recruitment, accrual,&#xD;
      retention, and compliance rates of HCM patients randomized to treatment with a placebo or two&#xD;
      escalating doses of NAC. Likewise, any potential side effects will be determined and the&#xD;
      effect size of NAC on indices of cardiac hypertrophy will be estimated. HCM, the main focus&#xD;
      of the study team's research during the past two decades, is the most common cause of sudden&#xD;
      cardiac death (SCD) in the young and an important cause of morbidity in the elderly. Despite&#xD;
      its clinical impact, there is no effective pharmacological therapy for HCM. None of the&#xD;
      current pharmacological therapies reverses or attenuates cardiac hypertrophy or reduces the&#xD;
      risk of SCD in adults. Cardiac hypertrophy, the quintessential clinical feature of human HCM,&#xD;
      is a major determinant of morbidity and the risk of SCD. Regression of cardiac hypertrophy is&#xD;
      expected to improve morbidity and decrease the risk of SCD in HCM, as observed upon&#xD;
      regression of load-dependent cardiac hypertrophy. The study team has generated transgenic&#xD;
      rabbit and mouse models of HCM and shown that cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis could be&#xD;
      reversed through genetic or pharmacological interventions. Results with NAC, a precursor to&#xD;
      glutathione, the largest intracellular thiol pool against oxidative stress, were most&#xD;
      promising. In three independent studies in two different transgenic models of HCM (rabbits&#xD;
      and mouse), treatment with NAC completely reversed cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis and&#xD;
      improved indices of diastolic function. The ultimate goal of every physician-scientist is to&#xD;
      apply the bench discoveries at the bedside. The study team proposes to test their findings in&#xD;
      the animal models in humans with HCM caused by sarcomere protein mutations. The use of NAC is&#xD;
      also supported by data showing increased oxidative stress in human HCM. Moreover, NAC has&#xD;
      been used extensively in humans and has a well-established safety profile. Resources&#xD;
      including patients with sarcomere protein mutations are available to successfully complete a&#xD;
      randomized placebo-controlled (N=25) pilot study to test two escalating doses of NAC (N=50),&#xD;
      administered for one year. The study aims to determine recruitment, accrual, retention and&#xD;
      compliance rates; tolerability, safety and side effects; and estimate the effect size of NAC&#xD;
      on the indices of cardiac hypertrophy at the baseline and after one year of treatment. Only&#xD;
      HCM patients with sarcomere proteins mutations will be included to exclude phenocopy. The&#xD;
      Core centers will interpret the phenotypic data to assure homogeneity. Data Coordinating&#xD;
      Center will assist in the research design, planning and conduct of the study and analysis of&#xD;
      the data. The findings will set the stage for large-scale robust randomized placebo-control&#xD;
      efficacy studies.&#xD;
