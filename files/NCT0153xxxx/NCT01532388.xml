      Objectives: This study compared the efficacy of eScreen in a two-armed randomized controlled&#xD;
      design, measuring outcomes in terms of changes in problematic drug use up to one year after&#xD;
      study recruitment. The eScreen brief Internet intervention for problematic alcohol and drug&#xD;
      use offers self-screening, in-depth self-reporting, personalized feedback and treatment&#xD;
      recommendations as well as an electronic diary. Progress over time is shown in diagrams&#xD;
      detailing consumption levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: Participants with only problematic drug use according to the Drug Use Disorders&#xD;
      Identification Test (DUDIT),(DUDIT &gt;0 for both men and women) or both problematic alcohol use&#xD;
      according to the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), (AUDIT &gt;7 for men and&#xD;
      AUDIT &gt;5 for women) and drug use were randomized to T1 (n=101) or the control group (n=101).&#xD;
      Outcomes on alcohol and/or drug use as well as health-related symptoms were assessed after 3,&#xD;
      6 and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses that were tested in this study are 1) that both groups would reduce their drug&#xD;
      consumption and drug-related problems at follow-ups compared to the baseline level and 2)&#xD;
      that participants in the eScreen group would reduce their drug consumption and drug-related&#xD;
      problems to a higher extent than participants in the control group (no intervention) at&#xD;
      follow-ups.&#xD;

      Background: The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of an Internet-based&#xD;
      screening and brief intervention (SBI) site for problematic alcohol and drug use among&#xD;
      illicit drug users.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: Individuals searching for information about alcohol or drugs online who scored over 0&#xD;
      on the Drug Use Disorders Identiﬁcation Test (DUDIT) and were 15 years or older were&#xD;
      recruited for this trial and randomized into one group receiving Internet-based screening and&#xD;
      brief intervention via eScreen.se(n = 101) or one assessment-only control group (n = 101).&#xD;
      Both groups were screened at baseline and followed up at 3 and 6 months. The primary outcome&#xD;
      measure was the DUDIT-C score and secondary outcome measures were DUDIT, AUDIT-C (Alcohol Use&#xD;
      Disorders Identiﬁcation Test-C) and AUDIT scores.Additional outcomes included the proportion&#xD;
      of drug abstainers and those who made a clinically signiﬁcant change in their alcohol and&#xD;
      drug use. Four statistical models of analysis were used to conservatively assess results.&#xD;

    <description>The primary outcome measure for this trial was the total DUDIT score for the first four DUDIT questions at 3-month follow-up, as a measure of drug consumption only, referred to as the DUDIT-C.The DUDIT-C is a measure including the first four items of the DUDIT, with a minimum score of 0 and a maximum score of 16. Higher scores mean a worse outcome. Regarding the DUDIT-C, you will find information on it in the following articles. Please note that the analyses all refer to the same sample from a randomized controlled trial. Apart from the data in the two articles describing results from the current study, there are additional analyses shown in:&#xD;

        <description>The primary outcome measure for this trial was the total DUDIT score for the first four DUDIT questions at 3-month follow-up, as a measure of drug consumption only, referred to as the DUDIT-C.The DUDIT-C is a measure including the first four items of the DUDIT, with a minimum score of 0 and a maximum score of 16. Higher scores mean a worse outcome. Regarding the DUDIT-C, you will find information on it in the following articles. Please note that the analyses all refer to the same sample from a randomized controlled trial.

        <description>The total AUDIT score at 12-month follow-up, as a summarized measure of drug use (including alcohol consumption and alcohol-related problems). The AUDIT, an 10-item scale, has a minimum score of 0 and a maximum score of 40. Higher scores mean a worse outcome.</description>
        <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
        <population>The analyzes have been carried out according to both the Intention To Treat method (ITT) and according to Per protocols method (PP). Where possible, missing values were imputed with last observation carried backwards. In cases where no follow-up data were available, the last observation was carried forward.</population>
