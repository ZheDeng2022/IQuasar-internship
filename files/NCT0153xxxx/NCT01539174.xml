    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well giving rituximab together with combination chemotherapy&#xD;
      works in treating patients with previously untreated high- or high-intermediate-risk diffuse&#xD;
      large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, can block cancer&#xD;
      growth in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer to grow and spread. Others find&#xD;
      cancer cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Drugs used in&#xD;
      chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride, vincristine sulfate, and&#xD;
      prednisone (CHOP), work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by&#xD;
      killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one drug, combination&#xD;
      chemotherapy, may kill more cancer cells. Giving rituximab together with combination&#xD;
      chemotherapy together may be an effective treatment for DLBCL&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate 1 year progression-free survival (PFS) following treatment with rituximab&#xD;
      intense dosing and CHOP-21 (RID-CHOP) in previously untreated patients with high risk&#xD;
      (International Prognostic Index [IPI] 3-5) DLBCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate, in previously untreated patients with high risk (IPI 3-5) DLBCL treated with&#xD;
      rituximab intense dosing and CHOP-21: Complete response (CR) rate, (as defined by&#xD;
      International Harmonization Project criteria using 18-fluorodeoxyglucose [FDG] -positron&#xD;
      emission tomography [PET]/computed tomography [CT]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Toxicity profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Rituximab pharmacokinetics for this dose and schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Effect of immunophenotype of DLBCL on outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Effect of Fc-Gamma Receptor III (FcyRIII) polymorphism genotype on outcome. OUTLINE:&#xD;
      Patients receive rituximab intravenously (IV) on days 0, 1, 4, 8, and 15 of course 1; days 1,&#xD;
      8, and 15 of course 2; and day 1 of all subsequent courses. Patients also receive CHOP&#xD;
      chemotherapy comprising cyclophosphamide IV, doxorubicin hydrochloride IV, and vincristine&#xD;
      sulfate IV on day 1, and prednisone orally (PO) on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 21 days&#xD;
      for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After&#xD;
      completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2-3 months for 2 years, every 6&#xD;
      months for 3 years, annually for up to 10 years.&#xD;
