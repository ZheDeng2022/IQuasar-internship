  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Irritable bowel syndrome, (IBS) is a common functional disorder of the gut that can be quite&#xD;
      disabling to patients. The most common symptoms of IBS are abdominal pain or discomfort along&#xD;
      with erratic changes in bowel habit of diarrhoea, constipation or a mixture of the two&#xD;
      (referred to as IBS subtypes). Despite much research efforts to further understand the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of IBS; as yet no specific biomarkers/definitive measurements have been&#xD;
      identified that can be use to aid the diagnosis and reduce the need for unnecessary,&#xD;
      unpleasant and expensive tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence shows that anxiety plays a part in IBS and can speed up transit time in the small&#xD;
      bowel. In this study, the investigators hypothesise that since anxiety is a common feature of&#xD;
      IBS, then fast small bowel transit is likely to be found in all subtypes of IBS and the&#xD;
      difference in stool frequency and consistency in IBS subgroups are therefore likely to&#xD;
      reflect differences in colonic function. The investigator wish to test this by measuring both&#xD;
      small and large bowel transit times using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and validate the&#xD;
      results of the MRI with two methods currently used in clinical practice -The previously&#xD;
      validated lactose-C13 Ureide breath test (for small bowel transit) and the standard&#xD;
      radio-opaque pellet method to assess the whole gut transit (WGT) time.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigator has 2 main parts in this study i.e. Study 1 and Study 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of study 1, the investigator would like to recruit up to 5 healthy volunteers as a&#xD;
      pilot study to optimise measurement and analysis of the Lactose-C13 Ureide breath test along&#xD;
      with MRI scannings at regular intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following from this, the investigator would like assess the feasibility and reproducibility&#xD;
      of using MRI imaging to assess gastrointestinal transit. The investigator would like to&#xD;
      recruit 21 healthy volunteers to measure orocaecal transit time (OCTT) and whole gut&#xD;
      transit(WGT)using the conventional method of Lactose-C13 Ureide breath test for OCTT and the&#xD;
      Metcalf method using standard radio-opaque pellet method for WGT and compare them will MRI&#xD;
      imaging. Once this has been analysed and the best method for each OCTT and WGT have been&#xD;
      decided, these methods would be applied in Study 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In study 2, the investigator would like to recruit 30 healthy volunteers, 30 patients with&#xD;
      diarrhoea predominantly Irritable Bowel Syndrome, 30 patients with constipation predominantly&#xD;
      Irritable Bowel Syndrome and 30 patients with Mixed irritable Bowel Syndrome. The best&#xD;
      methods from study 1 for OCTT and WGT will be applied here to assess gastrointestinal transit&#xD;
      on these subjects. Based on the first study, the best method to assess OCTT is the&#xD;
      Lactose-C13 Ureide breath test and for the WGT, the best method is the MRI marker capsules.&#xD;
      Participants will need to fill in questionnaires to assess their stress levels and to fill in&#xD;
      symptom questionnaires during the study day.&#xD;
