  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      H7N7 is one type of influenza virus that may pose a threat to humans if an outbreak occurs.&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the safety and immune response to an H7N7 vaccine in people who have&#xD;
      previously received a live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) as part of a research study&#xD;
      and people who have not previously received a LAIV.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Influenza A viruses are widely found in nature and can infect a wide variety of birds and&#xD;
      mammals, including humans. Some types of influenza A viruses are more likely to spread from&#xD;
      animals to humans, and researchers are interested in monitoring these viruses and developing&#xD;
      potential vaccines for them. H7N7 is one type of influenza A virus. In recent years, there&#xD;
      have been several H7N7 outbreaks among humans, and the development of an H7N7 vaccine is a&#xD;
      high priority. This study will enroll two groups of participants: people who have previously&#xD;
      received one of three types of a pandemic LAIV as part of a research study and people who&#xD;
      have not previously received a LAIV vaccine. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and immunogenicity of a single dose of an inactivated H7N7 vaccine in these two groups&#xD;
      of participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At a baseline study visit, all participants will undergo a medical history review, physical&#xD;
      examination, vital sign measurements, blood collection, and nasal secretion collection.&#xD;
      Female participants will provide a urine sample for pregnancy testing. All participants will&#xD;
      then receive one intramuscular (IM) injection of the H7N7 study vaccine in their upper arm.&#xD;
      They will remain in the clinic for 30 minutes for observation and monitoring. Participants&#xD;
      will monitor and record any adverse symptoms between study visits. Additional study visits&#xD;
      will occur at Days 4, 7, 14, 28, 56, and 180. At select study visits, participants will&#xD;
      undergo a medical history review, physical examination, and nasal secretion collection. Blood&#xD;
      collection will occur at each visit; some blood samples may be stored for future research.&#xD;
