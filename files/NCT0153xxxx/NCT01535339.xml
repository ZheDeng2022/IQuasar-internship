  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), also known as concussion, occurs commonly in sport.&#xD;
      Despite ongoing research, there is no highly sensitive clinical test for cognitive function.&#xD;
      This makes the clinical diagnosis of concussion particularly difficult as the clinical&#xD;
      presentation of concussion is highly variable with symptoms often evolving over time. Given&#xD;
      the variability in concussion presentations, there is no single test that can diagnose a&#xD;
      concussion. Current recommendations are that sports medicine providers apply a multifaceted&#xD;
      concussion assessment battery that combines subjective symptoms, motor control and cognitive&#xD;
      assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This investigation is designed to evaluate the clinical utility of ElMindA's BNA scores in&#xD;
      detecting and managing concussive injuries. This study will establish the reliability of BNA™&#xD;
      scores over clinically relevant assessment intervals and investigate the effect of SRC and&#xD;
      sub-concussive head impacts on BNA scores.&#xD;
