  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      If etiologies of temporomandibular disorders (TMD) are various, parafunctions become more and&#xD;
      more important. Treatment of patients presenting TMD is based on conservative and reversible&#xD;
      therapeutics. The behavioural reeducation of these patients which aims at decreasing their&#xD;
      parafunctions is a treatment often performed.&#xD;
