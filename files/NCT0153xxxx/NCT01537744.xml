      The purpose of this study is to determine whether 5-azacitidine in combination with&#xD;
      romidepsin cancer are effective in the treatment of advanced solid tumors.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a two part, single-institution, open-label, Phase I dose-escalation study of oral&#xD;
      5-azacitidine in combination with intravenous (IV) romidepsin. Part 1 of the study is a&#xD;
      traditional 3 + 3 dose escalation study designed to evaluate the maximum tolerated dose&#xD;
      (MTD), dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), safety, pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles, and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic profiles of increasing doses of orally administered 5-azacitidine in&#xD;
      combination with a constant dose of IV romidepsin. Part 2 is an expansion cohort study for&#xD;
      the preliminary evaluation of efficacy in the treatment of virally mediated cancers and&#xD;
      liposarcoma once the MTD has been determined. PK and PD data will also be collected for these&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Plasma samples will be obtained, prior and during treatment, to assess the methylation&#xD;
           status of free tumor DNA circulating in the blood&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Archival tissue will be obtained on all participants for future correlative studies,&#xD;
           such as baseline gene expression, methylation patterns.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants with accessible, biopsiable tumors will also undergo pre-treatment and&#xD;
           post-treatment (~cycle 2D1) biopsies for correlative studies in the expansion cohort.&#xD;

Level 1 200mg daily days 1-14 8mg/m2 days 8 and 15&#xD;

Level 4d MTD 8mg/m2 days 8, 15, and 22&#xD;
Each cycle will last 28 days.&#xD;
Subjects will be enrolled in Level -1 if the MTD is reached in the subjects enrolled in Level 1.&#xD;
On days when both agents are administered, oral 5-azacitidine should be administered at the start of the romidepsin infusion.&#xD;
Level 4 is optional and decisions whether to initiate this level will be based on discussions between the study investigator and Celgene.</description>
