      ASUKI Step is designed to increase the number of days employees walk 10,000 steps and to&#xD;
      reduce the number of days employees spend being inactive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study aims were:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to have a minimum of 400 employee participants from each university site reach a level&#xD;
           of 10, 000 steps per day on at least 100 days (3.5 months) during the trial period;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to have 70% of the employee participants from each university site maintain two or fewer&#xD;
           inactive days per week, defined as a level of less than 3,000 steps per day;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to describe the socio-demographic, psychosocial, environmental and health-related&#xD;
           determinants of success in the intervention; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. to evaluate the effects of a pedometer-based walking intervention in a university&#xD;
           setting on changes in self-perceived health and stress level, sleep patterns,&#xD;
           anthropometric measures and fitness.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      ASUKI Step is a 9-month pedometer-based worksite intervention conducted at the Karolinska&#xD;
      Institutet (KI) in Stockholm, Sweden and Arizona State University (ASU) in the greater&#xD;
      Phoenix area, Arizona. ASUKI Step used a quasi-experimental design based on the theory of&#xD;
      social support. Participants included 2,118 faculty, staff, and graduate students from ASU (n&#xD;
      = 712) and KI (n = 1,406) who participated in teams of 3-4 persons. The intervention required&#xD;
      participants to accumulate 10,000 steps each day for six months, with a 3-month follow-up&#xD;
      period. Steps were recorded onto a study-specific website. Participants completed a&#xD;
      website-delivered questionnaire four times to identify socio-demographic, health,&#xD;
      psychosocial and environmental correlates of study participation. One person from each team&#xD;
      at each university location was randomly selected to complete physical fitness testing to&#xD;
      determine their anthropometric and cardiovascular health and to wear an accelerometer for one&#xD;
      week. Incentives were given for compliance to the study protocol that included weekly raffles&#xD;
      for participation prizes and a grand finale trip to Arizona or Sweden for teams with most&#xD;
      days over 10,000 steps.&#xD;
