    <textblock>
      This research is being done to study the effectiveness of vitamin D (cholecalciferol) to&#xD;
      modify hepcidin levels in children with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Anemia is a common&#xD;
      problem in children with CKD. Anemia is when the body does not have enough healthy red blood&#xD;
      cells. Hepcidin is a protein in the blood which interferes with the body's production of red&#xD;
      blood cells. This study will see if vitamin D lowers hepcidin levels in children and young&#xD;
      adults with CKD. If so, it could be used as an additional treatment for anemia in these&#xD;
      children, in addition to the current therapies already in use including iron supplements and&#xD;
      erythropoietin. People between the ages of 1 and 21 with CKD may be considered for this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

      Vitamin D Supplementation is a practical and inexpensive intervention which is safe, readily&#xD;
      available and clinically indicated. Substantial recent evidence suggests vitamin D may modify&#xD;
      inflammatory pathways in CKD. There is a high probability of benefit and a low probability of&#xD;
      harm for this easily modifiable factor. 25D levels can be effectively modified through oral&#xD;
      supplementation with cholecalciferol. To the best of our knowledge, no studies examining the&#xD;
      effects of oral cholecalciferol supplementation on hepcidin levels have been conducted in&#xD;
      children with either CKD or other diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will conduct a randomized open-label controlled trial of oral cholecalciferol&#xD;
      supplementation in children aged 1-21 years with stage 2-5 (pre-dialysis) CKD receiving&#xD;
      regular nephrology follow-up at a tertiary-care children's hospital (Johns Hopkins Children's&#xD;
      Center). The intervention model will be parallel assignment. Children will be randomly&#xD;
      allocated to receive either cholecalciferol supplementation 4000 IU per day (28,000 IU&#xD;
      weekly) according to the KDOQI recommended supplementation for children with mild 25D&#xD;
      deficiency, or will be treated with 400 IU/day (2,800 IU/weekly), which is the recommended&#xD;
      dietary allowance.(1) Allocation will be double-blinded to prevent knowledge of allocation&#xD;
      status affecting interpretation of results. Study participants will be prescribed any&#xD;
      clinically indicated additional cholecalciferol supplementation once the 3-month laboratory&#xD;
      measures have been obtained, based on serum 25D levels at the end of the study period.(1) We&#xD;
      are proposing a supplementation dose of 4000 IU/day in children with CKD, which is considered&#xD;
      a safe dose by KDOQI standards; vitamin D2 doses as high as 10,000 IU/day have been given to&#xD;
      French patients with CKD for &gt; 1 year with no evidence of vitamin D toxicity.(2) 25D levels&#xD;
      between 40 and 80 are indicative of &quot;sufficiency&quot;, and a safe upper limit of intake, in which&#xD;
      the risk of hypercalcemia is negligible, has been defined as 10,000 IU/day.(3, 4)&#xD;
      Cholecalciferol will be provided in both tablet (vitamin D 2000 IU tablets and 400 IU&#xD;
      tablets, National Vitamin Company, Casa Grande, AZ) and liquid (Enfamil® D-Vi-Sol™ Drops, 400&#xD;
      IU per mL) form, based on the ability to tolerate and preference of the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be monitored for signs of 25D toxicity (hypercalcemia, hyperphosphatemia,&#xD;
      hypercalciuria) during the follow up period of 1 month and 3 months from baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Safety Monitoring Board will review serum calcium, phosphorus, and urine&#xD;
      calcium:creatinine ratio values at the one month visit; if subjects show evidence of&#xD;
      hypercalcemia or hyperphosphatemia (serum values &gt; upper limit of normal, age-specific&#xD;
      values, see Table 3 below), study drug will be discontinued.(3) If subjects demonstrate&#xD;
      evidence of hypercalciuria (urine calcium:cr ratio &gt; 0.6 in 1-2 year olds or &gt; 0.2 in &gt; 2&#xD;
      year olds) study drug will be discontinued.(5) In addition, if 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels &gt;&#xD;
      80 ng/mL are reached, the study drug will be discontinued. In any subject in whom study drug&#xD;
      is discontinued, the 3-month laboratory data will still be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the case of hypoalbuminemia (serum albumin &lt; 3.5 g/dL) corrected total serum calcium will&#xD;
      be calculated using the formula: Corrected calcium (mg/dL) = serum calcium (mg/dL) + 0.8 (4 -&#xD;
      serum albumin [g/dL])(2) Standardized blood pressure measurement will include three manual BP&#xD;
      measurements conducted after five minutes of rest with an aneroid sphygmomanometer, at least&#xD;
      30 seconds apart.&#xD;
