  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      International surveys about pathological gambling estimate that there are about 1 to 3 per&#xD;
      cent of gamblers who develop a pathological behavior about gamble.In France, pathological&#xD;
      gambling is not a priority of public health, in contrast with other addictive disorders, like&#xD;
      alcoholism or nicotine addiction. The aim of our study is to describe accurately for the&#xD;
      first time in France, a sample of &quot;at risk&quot; and pathological French gamblers. We want to&#xD;
      collect socio-demographical and clinical data from this subjects (story of the addictive&#xD;
      behaviour, co morbidities, and more specifically, detailed study of pathological gamblers'&#xD;
      personality), in order to compare our data with those of international&#xD;
      literature.Secondarily, we want to test the feasibility of this kind of detailed evaluations&#xD;
      for another study planned for 2007-2008 and which purpose will be to compare pathological&#xD;
      gamblers' personality characteristics according to the kind of game that they mainly&#xD;
      practice.The participation at the study will be proposed to every patient consulting in the&#xD;
      &quot;service d'addictologie du CHU de Nantes&quot;. The study consists in a single evaluation (about 8&#xD;
      hours) with standardized tools used all other the world.&#xD;
