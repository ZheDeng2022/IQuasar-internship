    <textblock>
      Over the past few years, growing evidences revealed that clearance of apoptotic cells by&#xD;
      phagocytosis can result in powerful anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects. In vivo,&#xD;
      apoptotic cells are cleared rapidly by neighboring cells, macrophages and related scavengers.&#xD;
      Defective clearance of apoptotic cells has been linked closely to autoimmunity and persistent&#xD;
      inflammatory disease. Several phagocytic receptors, bridging molecules produced by phagocytes&#xD;
      and 'eat-me' signals on apoptotic cells are coordinately involved in mediating clearance of&#xD;
      apoptotic cells. Complement receptors (CR3, CR4), collection, CD14, CD36 (Class B scavenger&#xD;
      receptor), class A scavenger receptor, asialoprotein receptor, Mer receptor kinase were&#xD;
      reported to recognize apoptotic cells. The best characterized system for clearance of&#xD;
      apoptotic cells is the recognition of phosphatidylserine (PS) on apoptotic cells by&#xD;
      phosphatidylserine receptor (PSR). Milk fat globule- epidermal growth factor 8 (MFG-E8) is an&#xD;
      opsonin that bridges phagocytes (by interacting with α vβ3, αvβ5 integrins via RGD motif) and&#xD;
      apoptotic cells (by binding PS through Factor V/VIII-C domain). Activated macrophages produce&#xD;
      and secret MFG-E8. MFG-E8 is a critical component in PSR-mediated phagocytosis of apoptotic&#xD;
      cells. The dominant negative mutant MFG-E8, D89E, that carried a mutated RGD motif inhibited&#xD;
      phagocytosis of apoptotic cells in vitro. Injection of D89E into wild type mice induced&#xD;
      autoantibodies and IgG deposition on glomeruli. Macrophages from MFG-E8 deficiency&#xD;
      (MFG-E8-/-) mice were impaired in engulfment of apoptotic cells, which can be restored by&#xD;
      adding recombinant MFG-E8. The female MFG-E8-/- mice spontaneously produced high titer of&#xD;
      autoantibodies and developed lupus-like glomerulonephritis at the age of week 40. Defective&#xD;
      clearance of apoptotic cells is closely related to development of autoimmunity. In the past 4&#xD;
      years, a growing number of molecules were recognized as receptors for the PS exposed on the&#xD;
      apoptotic cells. These molecules were capable of mediating phagocytic clearance, rendering&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory cytokines in the phagocytes, and modulating T cell responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aim of this proposal is to study genetic polymorphism in MFG-E8, PSR and other&#xD;
      factors implicated in phagocytic clearance of apoptotic cells among Taiwanese. By comparing&#xD;
      the polymorphism between patients with autoimmune disease (SLE or RA) and healthy control&#xD;
      subjects, we will investigate if genetic variations among individuals of genes encoding&#xD;
      proteins involved in clearance of apoptotic cells contribute to the pathogenesis of systemic&#xD;
      autoimmune diseases SLE and RA.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Over the past few years, there were growing evidences that clearance of apoptotic cells by&#xD;
      phagocytosis can result in powerful anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects. The&#xD;
      defective clearance of apoptotic cells has been linked to autoimmunity and persistent&#xD;
      inflammatory diseases. Apoptotic cells are cleared in vivo rapidly. Clearance of apoptotic&#xD;
      cells or apoptotic bodies is histologically undetectable in normal situation by neighboring&#xD;
      cells, or by macrophages and related scavengers. Defective clearance of apoptotic cells has&#xD;
      been linked closely to autoimmune and persistent inflammatory diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The process of discriminating apoptotic from live cells was found to be remarked complex.&#xD;
      Many phagocytic receptors, bridging molecules, and several 'eat-me' markers on apoptotic&#xD;
      cells are involved and coordinated interact with each other. A phagocytic-synapse interprets&#xD;
      the apoptotic-cell-associated molecular pattern (ACAMPS), and determine the behaviors&#xD;
      subsequent to phagocytosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clearance of apoptotic cells can be mediated by complement receptors CR3 (CD116/CD18), CR4&#xD;
      (CD11c/CD18), collections and CD14. However, the clearance of apoptotic cells does not&#xD;
      usually trigger either inflammation or an adaptive immune response. Clearance of apoptotic&#xD;
      cells can also be mediated by receptors that were firstly characterized to clear damaged&#xD;
      cells or altered-self-components.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The best characterized system for clearing the apoptotic cells is the recognition of&#xD;
      phosphatidylerine on the apoptotic cells. Phosphatidylserine (PS) was found to distribute in&#xD;
      the inner layer of plasma membrane phospholipid bi-layer in healthy cells. During apoptotic&#xD;
      process, inhibition of aminophopholipid translocase and activation of lipid scramblase result&#xD;
      in exposure of PS on the cell surface.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Defective macrophage clearance of apoptotic cells linked to autoimmunity. There were emerging&#xD;
      evidences indicating defective macrophage clearance of apoptotic cells linked to&#xD;
      autoimmunity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Systemic exposure to irradiated apoptotic cells induces autoantibody production. Normal&#xD;
           mice injected with 10^7 syngenic, apoptotic thymocytes developed transient and low titer&#xD;
           of anti-nuclear antibody, anti-cardiolipin, and anti-ssDNA antibody. All immunized mice&#xD;
           had IgG deposition in the glomeruli several months after immunization. IgG-deposition&#xD;
           was not found in the glomeruli of non-immunized or syngenic splenocyte-immunized&#xD;
           controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Defective clearance of apoptotic cells and SLE-like autoimmunity was found to be&#xD;
           associated C1q deficiency. C1q mice developed systemic autoimmunity spontaneously, with&#xD;
           a marked excess of free, non-ingested apoptotic cells of the kidney. Although congenital&#xD;
           deficiency of complement cascade is rare in humans, nearly all patients who were&#xD;
           deficient in C1q developed SLE-like disease. In both human and mice, inflammatory&#xD;
           macrophages had defect in the uptake of apoptotic cells and the defect could be rescued&#xD;
           by adding exogenous C1q.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Mer/kd (Mer knock-down) mice developed autoimmune disease Mer is a member of&#xD;
           Ax1/Mer/Tyro3 receptor tyrosine kinase family. Growth arrest-specific gene 6 (GAS6) was&#xD;
           shown to bridge Mer to phosphatidylserine on apoptotic cells. Mer-kd mice had&#xD;
           macrophages deficient in clearance of apoptotic thymocytes. The phagocytic deficiency&#xD;
           was restricted to apoptotic cells and was independent of Fc receptor-mediated&#xD;
           phagocytosis or ingestion of other particles. Mer-kd mice developed progressive&#xD;
           lupus-like immunity, with antibodies to chromatin, DNA, and IgG. The autoimmunity&#xD;
           appears to be spontaneously, driven by endogenous antigens, with little polyclonal B&#xD;
           cell activation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Impaired phagocytosis of apoptotic material by monocyte-derived macrophages from&#xD;
           patients with SLE. Reduced clearance of apoptotic cells in SLE patients was observed,&#xD;
           although apoptosis was normally happened.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Milk fat globule-EGF factor 8 (MFG-E8) was characterized in mouse milk glycoproteins, 53 and&#xD;
      66 kD, peripherally associated with the membrane surrounding the lipid droplet (milk fat&#xD;
      globule membrane, MFGM). MFG-E8 is expressed abundantly in lactating mammary glands and&#xD;
      secreted in associated with milk fat globules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MFG-E8 consists of two repeated EGF-like domains on the terminal side and tandem&#xD;
      discoidin-like (C-) domains homologous to the C1 and C2 domains of coagulation factor V and&#xD;
      VIII. The C2 domain can mediate Ca2+-independent binding to PS. MFG-E8 expression is&#xD;
      up-regulated in lactating mammary gland, and has been detected in other tissues such as&#xD;
      brain, lung, heart, kidney and spleen in mouse, bovine and human.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second EGF-like domain of MFG-E8 contains an integrin-binding motif, namely Arg-Gly-ASP&#xD;
      (RGD) sequence. The RGD motif is conserved in all known MFG-E8 sequence in different species.&#xD;
      It can bind to αvβ3 and αvβ5 integrins. MFG-E8 was characterized as a peripheral membrane&#xD;
      protein, although there was no apparent hydrophobic transmembrane domain, and bind directly&#xD;
      to MFGM or cell membrane. The MFG-E8 binds to anionic phospholipids, especially&#xD;
      phosphatidylserine, on the second C (C2) domain independent of Calcium ions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reports indicated that MFG-E8 secreted extracellularly despite its membrane associated&#xD;
      nature. MFG-E8 was found to be a major component of secretory membrane vesicles (exosomes)&#xD;
      secreted by murine dendric cell line, D1. The glioma cell line (C6) secrets MFG-E8 into the&#xD;
      culture media. MFG-E8 is also detected in embryonic gonad extracellularly and in the sera of&#xD;
      patients with metastatic tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MFG-E8 was regards as an opsonin that bridge apoptotic cells, which with surface&#xD;
      phoshatidylserine exposure, and phagocyte bearing αvβ3 and αvβ5 integrins. Hanayana et. al.&#xD;
      showed that thioglycollate-elicited macrophages produced and secreted MFG-E8. MFG-E8&#xD;
      significantly bound to apoptotic cells by recognizing aminophospholipids such as&#xD;
      phosphatidylserine and bound to macrophages via its RGD motif, particularly strongly to αvβ3&#xD;
      integrin. Transfected NIH3T3 cell with high αvβ5 expression can engulf apoptotic cell in the&#xD;
      presence of MFG-E8. The MFG-E8 dominant negative mutant that carries a point mutation in the&#xD;
      RGD motif inhibited phagocytosis of apoptotic cells by peritoneal macrophages in vivo and in&#xD;
      vitro. Borisenko et. al. estimated that MFG-E8 bind 2~8 fold stronger to oxidized PS than to&#xD;
      native PS. And they also proposed MFG-E8 might bind to another cofactor, annexin I, on&#xD;
      apoptotic cells, thus increase protein-membrane interaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human MFG-E8 gene was located on chromosome 15q25. The cDNA clone contains coding sequence&#xD;
      for 387 ammo-acid peptides of which 263 (68%) are identical with mouse protein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tingible body macrophages, characterized by CD68+ F4/80-, in spleen and lymph node express&#xD;
      significant level of MFG-E8. Peritoneal macrophages elicited by thioglycollate secrete&#xD;
      abundant MFG-E8 protein of 74 kD in the culture supernatant. The macrophages from MFG-E8(-/-)&#xD;
      mice engulf few apoptotic cells compared to the macrophages from their normal littermates in&#xD;
      vitro. Addition of recombinant MFG-E8 in the culture restored the ability of MFG-E8(-/-) Mφs&#xD;
      to engulf apoptotic cells in a doze-dependent manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In germinal centers, somatic hypermutation and secondary BCR rearrangement are involved in&#xD;
      BCR affinity maturation. The modified BCRs with lower affinity will be removed by apoptosis.&#xD;
      Tingible body macrophages are responsible for the MFG-E8-dependent clearance of apoptotic&#xD;
      cells. Tingible body Mφs in wild type mice engulfed and digested the apoptotic B cells&#xD;
      efficiently, whereas the MFG-E8(-/-) Mφs just wrapped many apoptotic cells without&#xD;
      engulfment42. The MFG-E8(-/-) mice developed splenomegaly in an age-dependent manner. The&#xD;
      white pulps in the spleens of the MFG-E8(-/-) mice were greatly enlarged and carried numerous&#xD;
      germinal centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The follicular zones were enlarged. There were 2 to 3 times more lymphocytes in the spleens&#xD;
      of the MFG-E8(-/-) mice. An increased number of IgG-producing cells were found in the spleen&#xD;
      follicles. The female MFG-E8(-/-) mice spontaneously produced high titer of anti-antibodies&#xD;
      anti-dsDNA and ANA at the age of week 40 but not at w10. Immunization female 10-week-old mice&#xD;
      twice with KLH promoted ANA production 20 days later in MFG-E8(-/-) but not wild type mice.&#xD;
      Immune complex deposition, hyper-cellularity of glomeruli, and proteinuria were observed in&#xD;
      most female MFG-E8(-/-) mice at week 40. Therefore, inefficient engulfment of apoptotic B&#xD;
      cells by might lead to lupus-like autoimmune disease. Kenichi et al. showed that masking&#xD;
      phosphatidylserine by MFG-E8 mutant D89E, carrying a point mutation in RGD motif, inhibited&#xD;
      not only the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells by macrophages of different origins but also the&#xD;
      production of IL10 by thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages after phagocytosing&#xD;
      apoptotic cells. When D89E MFG-E8 was injected into wild type mice intravenously,&#xD;
      auto-antibodies were induced. The production of auto-antibodies was enhanced by co-injection&#xD;
      of syngenic apoptotic cells. The auto-antibodies persisted for a long-term and IgG deposition&#xD;
      on glomeruli took place. These results added in proof that the impairment of phagocytic&#xD;
      clearance of apoptotic cells leads to auto-antibody production and autoimmune disease.In the&#xD;
      past 4 years, a growing number of molecules were recognized as receptors for the PS exposed&#xD;
      on the apoptotic cells. These molecules were capable of mediating phagocytic clearance,&#xD;
      rendering anti-inflammatory cytokines in the phagocytes, and modulating T cell responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aim of this proposal is to study genetic polymorphism in MFG-E8, PSR and other&#xD;
      factors implicated in phagocytic clearance of apoptotic cells among Taiwanese. By comparing&#xD;
      the polymorphism between patients with autoimmune disease (SLE or RA) and healthy control&#xD;
      subjects, we will investigate if genetic variations among individuals of genes encoding&#xD;
      proteins involved in clearance of apoptotic cells contribute to the pathogenesis of systemic&#xD;
      autoimmune diseases SLE and RA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      As described in the above introduction, in order to test if factors involved in clearance of&#xD;
      apoptotic cells are implicated in pathogenesis of human autoimmune diseases, we intend to&#xD;
      investigate if the genetic variation among individuals of genes encoding proteins involved in&#xD;
      clearance of apoptotic cells, MFG-E8 and PSR, contributes to pathogenesis of human autoimmune&#xD;
      diseases SLE and RA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this proposal:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Find out genetic polymorphism of human PSR gene in Taiwan by study single nucleotide&#xD;
           polymorphism (SNPs) of PSR genes among Taiwanese subjects using PCR and DNA sequencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study the PSR SNPs in SLE and RA patients and non-auto-immune control subjects by&#xD;
           PCR/sequence-specific oligonucleotide probe hybridization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Compare the allelic distribution of each SNP among patients and control group and find&#xD;
           if there is disease-associated SNP(s) in PSR gene.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Find out genetic polymorphism of human MFG-E8 gene in Taiwan by study SNPs of MFG-E8&#xD;
           genes among Taiwanese subjects using PCR and DNA sequencing.&#xD;
