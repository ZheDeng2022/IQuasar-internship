  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients have a type of lymph gland cancer called HD, NHL or lymphoepithelioma (these 3&#xD;
      diseases will be referred to as &quot;Lymphoma&quot;). The lymphoma has come back or has not gone away&#xD;
      after treatment. This is a research study using special immune system cells called&#xD;
      TGFb-resistant LMP-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (DNR-CTL), a new experimental therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some patients with Lymphoma show signs of infection with the Epstein Barr virus (EBV) before&#xD;
      or at the time of their Lymphoma diagnosis. EBV is found in the cancer cells of up to 1/2 the&#xD;
      patients with Lymphoma, suggesting it may play a role in causing Lymphoma. The cancer cells&#xD;
      infected by EBV are able to hide from the body's immune system and escape being killed by&#xD;
      releasing a substance called Transforming Growth Factor-beta (TGFb). The investigators want&#xD;
      to see if special white blood cells (called T cells) that have been given a gene that they&#xD;
      hope will let them survive against TGFb and that have been trained to kill EBV infected cells&#xD;
      can also survive in the blood and kill the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators have used this sort of therapy with specially trained T cells to treat a&#xD;
      different type of cancer that occurs after bone marrow and solid organ transplant called post&#xD;
      transplant lymphoma. In this type of cancer they were able to successfully prevent and treat&#xD;
      post transplant lymphoma. However when they used a similar approach in HD some patients had a&#xD;
      partial response to this therapy, but no patients had a complete response. In a follow-up&#xD;
      study they tried to find out if they could improve this treatment by growing T cells that&#xD;
      recognize 2 of the proteins expressed on Lymphoma cells called LMP-1 and LMP2a. These special&#xD;
      T cells were called LMP-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs). Although some patients had&#xD;
      tumor responses, CTL therapy alone did not cure those who had a lot of disease. Investigators&#xD;
      think that a reason for this is that the tumor cells are releasing TGFb. For this reason,&#xD;
      they want to find out if they can make the CTL resistant to TGFb by putting in a new gene&#xD;
      called TGFb resistance gene. Investigators hope that this will improve this treatment for&#xD;
      relapsed lymphoma. These TGFb-resistant LMP-specific CTLs are an investigational product not&#xD;
      approved by FDA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to find the largest safe dose of TGFb resistant LMP-specific&#xD;
      CTLs, to learn what the side effects are and to see whether this therapy might help patients&#xD;
      with Lymphoma.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will test a biopsy of the tumor to see if the tumor cells are EBV positive and&#xD;
      to see if the subject is eligible for this study. Then they will take some blood from the&#xD;
      donor, which is used to grow T cells. First they will grow a special type of cell called&#xD;
      dendritic cells (or monocytes), which stimulates the T cells and add a specially produced&#xD;
      human adenovirus that carries the LMP1 and LMP-2a genes into the dendritic cells(or&#xD;
      monocytes). Addition of a gene to the cells is known as gene transfer. These dendritic cells&#xD;
      (or monocytes) are then used to stimulate T cells. The stimulation trains the T cells to kill&#xD;
      cells with LMP on their surface. Investigators will then make more LMP-specific CTLs by&#xD;
      stimulating them with EBV infected cells (which we will make from the subject's blood or the&#xD;
      donor's blood by infecting them with EBV in the laboratory). They also will put the&#xD;
      adenovirus that carries the LMP1 and LMP2 genes into these EBV infected cells so that they&#xD;
      increase the amount of LMP1 and LMP2, which these cells have.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These EBV infected cells are treated with radiation so they cannot grow. Once sufficient&#xD;
      numbers of T cells are made, investigators test them to see if they kill cells with LMP on&#xD;
      their surface. To make sure that these cells won't attack the subjects tissues they test the&#xD;
      cells against the skin cells or against T cells that they grow in the laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To make these CTL resistant to the effects of the TGFb released by the tumor we put in a new&#xD;
      gene called a mutant TGFb receptor. Investigators used a mouse retrovirus that had been&#xD;
      changed to stop it from causing infection to add the mutant TGFb receptor to the cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WHAT THE INFUSION WILL BE LIKE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the cells are made, they will be frozen. If the subject agrees to participate in this&#xD;
      study, at the time they are scheduled to be treated, the cells will then be thawed and&#xD;
      injected into the subject over 10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially two doses of T cells will be given two weeks apart. If after the second infusion,&#xD;
      there is a reduction in the size of the subject's lymphoma (or no increase) on CT or MRI&#xD;
      scans as assessed by a radiologist, the subject can receive up to six additional doses if it&#xD;
      would be to their benefit, if they would like to receive more doses, and if there is enough&#xD;
      product remaining to give them additional doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a dose escalation study as investigators don't know what the highest dose of T cells&#xD;
      with the new gene is safe. To find out, they will give the cells to 2 participants at one&#xD;
      dose level. If that is safe they will raise the dose given to the next group of participants.&#xD;
      The dose the subject will get will depend on how many participants get the agent before and&#xD;
      how they react. The investigator will tell the subject this information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of the Treatments will be given by the Center for Cell and Gene Therapy at Texas&#xD;
      Children's Hospital or Houston Methodist Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FOLLOW-UP STUDIES We will follow the subject after the injections. Total time participation&#xD;
      for this study will be 15 years.&#xD;
