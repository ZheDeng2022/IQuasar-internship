    <textblock>
      The substantially increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality rates in chronic kidney&#xD;
      disease (CKD) patients cannot be sufficiently explained by traditional coronary risk factors.&#xD;
      It is apparent that inflammation of the vessel wall plays an essential role in the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of atherosclerosis, and the strong association between elevated inflammatory&#xD;
      biomarkers and cardiovascular death further supports this mechanism. Approximately 50% of the&#xD;
      mortality in this population of patients is attributable to cardiovascular disease. Insulin&#xD;
      resistance is also a common problem in uremic patients. It has been shown that insulin&#xD;
      resistance may contribute to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. An intriguing&#xD;
      observation in CKD patients with advanced uremia is that the metabolic profile of these&#xD;
      patients is characterized by persistent low-grade inflammation, a state of insulin&#xD;
      resistance, and significantly increased prevalence of atherosclerosis. It is possible that&#xD;
      these metabolic derangements can be the inciting factors for development and progression of&#xD;
      uremic atherosclerosis. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma) is a&#xD;
      ligand-activated nuclear transcription factor found in cells of the immune system and the&#xD;
      vasculature, where it exerts an overall protective effect on the development of&#xD;
      atherosclerosis, in part through modulation of inflammation. The agonists for PPAR-gamma&#xD;
      improve not only the insulin resistance, but also have profound beneficial effects on&#xD;
      inflammation, oxidative stress, endothelium, and lipid metabolism. In this proposal, the&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that short-term administration of a PPAR-gamma agonist&#xD;
      (pioglitazone) will improve the inflammatory state, insulin resistance, and endothelial&#xD;
      dysfunction in chronic kidney disease patients with advanced uremia.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with Stage 3 or 4 chronic kidney disease as measured by a Modification in&#xD;
             Diet in Renal Disease Study (MDRD) estimate of between 15 ml/min and 59 ml/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Age between 18 and 75 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients without hospitalization for cardiac or infection related morbidity over the&#xD;
             previous four weeks (due to the potential confounding effects on baseline study&#xD;
             variables).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients who are able to provide consent to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with prior documented diagnosis of diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with fasting blood glucose &gt; 110mg/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Prisoners, patients will significant mental illness, pregnant women, and other&#xD;
             vulnerable populations.&#xD;
&#xD;

             any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients for whom living donor renal transplantation is already scheduled or in the&#xD;
             process of being evaluated, as these patients will be unlikely to complete study&#xD;
             protocols before transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients with severe co-morbid conditions (eg, symptomatic hepatic cirrhosis,&#xD;
             metastatic cancer, HIV infection with AIDS).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patient with active inflammatory process (eg., SLE, rheumatoid arthritis, gout) for&#xD;
             which they are currently receiving immune modulating medications.&#xD;
