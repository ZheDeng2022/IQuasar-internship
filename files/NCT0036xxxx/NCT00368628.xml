      New stroke therapies are needed. This study seeks to provide the preliminary data needed to&#xD;
      plan a future study that will evaluate the efficacy of using continuous positive airway&#xD;
      pressure (CPAP) to treat stroke patients who have sleep apnea. Our goal is to use this&#xD;
      therapy to reduce stroke symptom severity.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND Sleep apnea occurs in 60-96% of stroke survivors and is associated with poor&#xD;
      functional recovery and higher post-stroke mortality. Among patients without stroke,&#xD;
      continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is a safe and effective treatment for sleep apnea.&#xD;
      This feasibility pilot study is a step in planning a future efficacy trial of CPAP for&#xD;
      patients with acute ischemic stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES The primary objectives are, among acute ischemic stroke patients, to: (1)&#xD;
      determine the feasibility of performing polysomnography; (2) refine the process for providing&#xD;
      CPAP within 48-hours of stroke onset; and (3) determine the effect of CPAP on blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS This randomized controlled feasibility study will enroll 100 acute ischemic stroke&#xD;
      patients. Intervention patients (N=60) receive CPAP within 48 hours of stroke onset and&#xD;
      continuing for up to 30 days. At 30 days post-enrollment, the intervention patients undergo&#xD;
      unattended polysomnography. Control (N=40) patients receive unattended polysomnography at&#xD;
      baseline and after 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SIGNIFICANCE CPAP represents an important new potential therapy for acute stroke. CPAP may&#xD;
      reduce both the neurological symptom severity of the acute stroke and prevent stroke&#xD;
      recurrence.&#xD;
