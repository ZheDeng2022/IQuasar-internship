  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish retrospectively a nationwide registry of patients&#xD;
      who have suffered drug-induced liver injury (DILI), and to collect, immortalize and store&#xD;
      serum, DNA, and lymphocytes from these patients. ILIAD will serve as a resource for&#xD;
      subsequent mechanistic investigations into the basis of severe idiosyncratic DILI. The&#xD;
      primary goal of the ILIAD protocol is to create: (a) a clinical database consisting of&#xD;
      individuals who have experienced severe DILI caused by four specific drugs, and the relevant&#xD;
      clinical data concerning the episode of DILI; and, (b) to create a bank of biological&#xD;
      specimens obtained from these individuals. These biological specimens will be DNA, plasma,&#xD;
      and immortalized lymphocytes. Immortalized lymphocytes will provide unlimited amounts of&#xD;
      genomic DNA for study as well as living immune cells for phenotyping studies. A secondary&#xD;
      goal of the ILIAD protocol is to maintain a registry of cases in the ILIAD database so that&#xD;
      they may be recontacted in the future. It is expected that this will facilitate additional&#xD;
      studies exploring the mechanisms of DILI.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is the single most common reason for regulatory actions&#xD;
      concerning drugs, including failure to gain approval for marketing, removal from the market&#xD;
      place, and restriction of prescribing indications. DILI is also a significant cause of&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality in many patient populations. To stimulate and facilitate research&#xD;
      into DILI, the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) has&#xD;
      recently established the Drug-Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN). One of the initial&#xD;
      projects to be conducted by the network is to retrospectively establish a nationwide registry&#xD;
      of patients who have suffered severe idiosyncratic liver injury associated with any drugs&#xD;
      (ILIAD) and HDS agents, and to collect, immortalize and store serum, DNA, and lymphocytes&#xD;
      from these patients (hereafter referred to as the &quot;ILIAD protocol&quot;). This ILIAD protocol will&#xD;
      serve as a resource for subsequent mechanistic investigations of the basis for susceptibility&#xD;
      to severe idiosyncratic DILI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The network will initially identify people who have developed DILI onset beyond 6 months of&#xD;
      enrollment due to all drugs or HDS/CAM cases that did not meet the entrance criteria for the&#xD;
      Prospective study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Establish and maintain a clinical database of these people that contains relevant&#xD;
           clinical data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Establish a bank of biological specimens (serum, DNA, and immortalized lymphocytes)&#xD;
           prepared from cases and control in the clinical database.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Maintain a registry including yearly updated contact information of the subjects&#xD;
           enrolled in the clinical database so that it is possible to recontact these individuals&#xD;
           at a later date to offer participation in studies which are not part of the current&#xD;
           proposal.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Screening Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        To be included in the ILIAD registry, the following criteria must be satisfied:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The treating gastroenterologist / hepatologist or health care professional must&#xD;
             believe that the subject suffered drug-induced liver injury;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject must be alive and the date of onset of the qualifying DILI episode must&#xD;
             have occurred on or after January 1, 1994;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of injury that is known or suspected to be related to consumption of a drug&#xD;
             or HDS/CAM product&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is taking only one of these drugs or HDS agent(s) in the period leading up&#xD;
             to the onset of the qualifying DILI episode;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have clinically important DILI defined in terms of serum aspartate aminotransferase&#xD;
             (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and alkaline phosphatase (Alk Phos).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sufficient documentation of the event for the Causality Committee to make a&#xD;
             determination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects will be excluded according to the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  are not willing to have medical information and blood samples taken;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  are unable to adequately give informed consent to participate in the study including&#xD;
             the blood draw for the genetic component;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  age &lt; 2 years old at the time of study enrollment (due to blood volume requirements).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a competing cause of liver injury such as hepatic ischemia that the investigator&#xD;
             felt to be the primary reason for the observed liver injury. Known, pre-existing&#xD;
             autoimmune hepatitis; primary biliary cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, or&#xD;
             other chronic biliary tract disease. Subjects are excluded due to acetaminophen&#xD;
             hepatoxicity or liver transplant or allogeneic bone marrow transplant prior to&#xD;
             development of drug-CAM induced liver injury.&#xD;
