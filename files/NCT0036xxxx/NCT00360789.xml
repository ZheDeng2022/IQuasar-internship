  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that adding functional strength training&#xD;
      to UK conventional therapy improves muscle function and walking than either UK conventional&#xD;
      therapy alone or increased intensity of UK conventional therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neuromuscular weakness occurs frequently after stroke and the processes underlying recovery&#xD;
      are still poorly understood. Accepted practice in UK physiotherapy is to avoid training of&#xD;
      muscle strength after stroke but there is preliminary evidence that it might be effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An observer-blind randomised pilot clinical trial (Phase II). Subjects will be within 3&#xD;
      months of first stroke with some voluntary movement in the paretic upper limb.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Research Physiotherapist, blinded to measurement, will recruit subjects, allocate subjects&#xD;
      to one of three intervention groups using sequentially numbered sealed envelopes containing&#xD;
      previously allocated intervention cards and provide interventions. Ten participants will be&#xD;
      recruited to each group therefore the trial will recuit 30 participants. The Research&#xD;
      Assessor, blinded to intervention allocation will undertake all measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional therapy (control) will be provided as normal for the clinical setting, the&#xD;
      additional conventional therapy (experimental 1)or functional strength training (experimental&#xD;
      2) will be provided for one hour, five times a week for six weeks. Subjects in the two&#xD;
      experimental groups will also receive the conventional therapy standard in their clinical&#xD;
      setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinded measurement will be made before randomisation, at the end of intervention and&#xD;
      12-weeks thereafter. Primary outcomes are the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT)and the Nine&#xD;
      Hole Peg Test (9HPT). The secondary outcomes are peak torque around the elbow joint in elbow&#xD;
      flexion and extension, grip force, pinch force, smoothness of movement during turning a&#xD;
      cranked wheel and reciprocal inniveration of biceps and triceps during turning of a cranked&#xD;
      wheel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analysed using descriptive statistics and the estimation of standard deviations&#xD;
      will be used to inform a power calculation to estimate sample size for a Phase II randomised&#xD;
      controlled trial.&#xD;
