      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as Gliadel wafer and O6-benzylguanine, work in&#xD;
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping&#xD;
      them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving Gliadel wafer together with&#xD;
      O6-benzylguanine works in treating patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Define the activity of Gliadel® wafers in combination with a 5-day infusion of&#xD;
           O6-benzylguanine in patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Define the toxicity of Gliadel® wafers in combination with 5-day infusion of&#xD;
           O6-benzylguanine in patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo surgical resection of tumor followed by placement of Gliadel® wafers .&#xD;
      Within 6 hours after completion of surgery, patients receive a 1 hour high dose infusion of&#xD;
      O6-benzylguanine followed by a lower dose continuous infusion for 5 days. Every 48 hours a&#xD;
      repeat infusion of the high dose over 1 hour will be administered for a total of 3 doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients should be accrued for this study.&#xD;

&#xD;
        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS-&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically confirmed recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (including gliosarcoma)&#xD;
             which can be confirmed, if not earlier, by intraoperative pathological diagnosis on&#xD;
             frozen section&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of a unilateral, single focus of measurable Central Nervous System (CNS)&#xD;
             neoplasm on contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography&#xD;
             (CT) scan that is supratentorial and measures ≥ 1.0 cm in diameter&#xD;
&#xD;
        PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS-&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Greater than or equal to 18 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
