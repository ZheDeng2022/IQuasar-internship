      The purpose of the study is to determine the feasibility of providing buprenorphine&#xD;
      maintenance to opioid-dependent offenders in a jail setting and of transitioning those&#xD;
      patients to buprenorphine maintenance in the community after their release.&#xD;

      Background: Heroin and other opioid abuse continues as a significant problem among the&#xD;
      criminal justice population. In 2002, the criminal justice system was the source of referral&#xD;
      for 36% of all substance abuse treatment admissions, the largest source of referrals. Heroin&#xD;
      use among offenders has serious health and social consequences. Injection, still the primary&#xD;
      route of administration among heroin users, is strongly associated with the transmission of&#xD;
      HIV, hepatitis C and other blood-borne diseases. During 1997, 20% to 26% of all people living&#xD;
      with HIV in the United States, and 29% to 43% of all those infected with hepatitis C, passed&#xD;
      through a correctional facility. The relationship between heroin use and criminal activity&#xD;
      has been extensively documented. Although methadone maintenance has been the primary&#xD;
      treatment for chronic opioid dependence since the 1970's, correctional systems in the U.S.,&#xD;
      with very few exceptions (primarily Rikers Island in New York City), have not provided&#xD;
      institutional access to methadone maintenance. Regrettably, negative attitudes to methadone&#xD;
      are prevalent among criminal justice professionals, the public, treatment providers and&#xD;
      opioid-dependent offenders themselves; there is little prospect of that changing soon.&#xD;
      Buprenorphine maintenance is a recently approved therapy that may be more acceptable than&#xD;
      methadone to the criminal justice system and opioid-dependent offenders. With one minor&#xD;
      exception, buprenorphine has never been systematically administered as an opioid replacement&#xD;
      therapy in a correctional setting in the U.S.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims and Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the feasibility of providing buprenorphine maintenance to opioid-dependent&#xD;
           offenders in a jail setting and of transitioning those patients to buprenorphine&#xD;
           maintenance in the community after their release.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To conduct a randomized clinical trial of buprenorphine maintenance (N=50) vs. methadone&#xD;
           maintenance (N=50) initiated in the jail setting and continuing in the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine the reasons that offenders fail to report for community buprenorphine or&#xD;
           methadone treatment after release or drop out of community treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Consenting eligible inmates at Rikers Island in New York City will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to buprenorphine or methadone maintenance in jail and will be referred to a&#xD;
      corresponding community treatment upon their release. Subjects will be followed-up at 3&#xD;
      months after release from jail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target Population: Opioid-dependent jail inmates sentenced to 10- 90 days.&#xD;
