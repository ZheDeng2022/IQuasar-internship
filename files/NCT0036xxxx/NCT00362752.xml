    <textblock>
      The hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS)and pre-HPS is a disease seen in patients with chronic&#xD;
      liver disease, whereby patients develop dilations in the blood vessels of the lungs,&#xD;
      resulting in low oxygen levels and shortness of breath.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, each HPS and pre-HPS subject will be treated with a commonly used antibiotic&#xD;
      called &quot;norfloxacin&quot; (approved for use in the treatment of gonorrhea, prostatitis and urinary&#xD;
      tract infections) for a 4-week period. In order to ensure that any observed improvement was&#xD;
      indeed due to norfloxacin, each subject will also be treated with a separate 4-week course of&#xD;
      an identical placebo. There will also be a 4 week wash-out period (no study&#xD;
      medication/placebo) between the 2 courses of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of the study will be to measure improvements in oxygen levels while on&#xD;
      norfloxacin, although a number of secondary parameters will also be followed.&#xD;

      Research Question:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pilot study; the fundamental research question is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Does norfloxacin administration reduce Alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient (AaDO2) in patients&#xD;
      with HPS and pre-HPS?&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, for this particular pilot study, the research question is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      What is the magnitude and standard deviation of the change in A-a gradient with norfloxacin&#xD;
      treatment in subjects with HPS and pre-HPS ?&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is in order to enable accurate sample size estimations for a future large&#xD;
      randomized-controlled trial of norfloxacin administration in the treatment of HPS and&#xD;
      pre-HPS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      HPS and pre-HPS is a disease that carries a high morbidity and an alarmingly high mortality.&#xD;
      Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is the only effective treatment, and in itself&#xD;
      threatens a significant operative mortality in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A growing body of literature has built an elegant and compelling case for the role of gut&#xD;
      bacterial translocation and secondary pulmonary nitric oxide (NO) overproduction in the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of HPS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sophisticated rat model and a case report in a human subject have supported the potential&#xD;
      for norfloxacin, a widely available, cheap and non-toxic antibiotic, to mitigate these&#xD;
      effects and improve oxygenation, which is the most important contributor to both morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality in HPS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the dismal prognosis of this disease, the biological plausibility of the hypothesis,&#xD;
      and the minimal foreseeable deleterious consequences of the intervention, it behooves the&#xD;
      scientific community to formally test this theory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to evaluate the magnitude and standard deviation of the change in AaDO2 with norfloxacin&#xD;
           treatment in subjects with HPS and pre-HPS, to enable accurate sample size estimations&#xD;
           for a future large randomized-controlled trial of norfloxacin administration in the&#xD;
           treatment of HPS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to evaluate subject recruitment and retention, in order to determine the feasibility of&#xD;
           a future large randomized-controlled trial of norfloxacin administration in the&#xD;
           treatment of HPS and pre-HPS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to qualitatively evaluate the usefulness of a number of new measures that have never&#xD;
           been utilized in this subject population (baseline dyspnea index (BDI), transitional&#xD;
           dyspnea index (TDI), Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire (CRQ)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to evaluate the hypothesized role of alveolar NO (measured by exhaled NO) as an&#xD;
           intermediary in the relationship between norfloxacin administration and AaDO2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. Overview of Study Design - intervention and maneuver&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single-university center (University of Toronto), randomized, controlled pilot&#xD;
      study with a crossover design. The intervention is exposure to norfloxacin (400 mg po bid)&#xD;
      for a 4-week period, compared to an identical placebo treatment. In the crossover design, all&#xD;
      subjects will receive both norfloxacin and the placebo medication, but the order of treatment&#xD;
      will be randomized, as detailed in the study maneuver, below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study maneuver:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will be identified by Drs. Faughnan and Gupta. They will subsequently be&#xD;
      recruited by the respirology research coordinator (see details below). Next, the hospital&#xD;
      pharmacist will provide each subject with a 4-week supply of either norfloxacin 400 mg po&#xD;
      bid, or an identical placebo, according to the pre-determined computerized randomization&#xD;
      scheme. The pharmacist will be the only person aware of the treatment allocation throughout&#xD;
      the study (subjects, research coordinator, treating physicians and outcome assessors will be&#xD;
      blinded). After the initial 4-week treatment, there will be a 4-week washout period, after&#xD;
      which the pharmacist will provide each subject with a 4-week supply of the alternative agent&#xD;
      (crossover) (see figure 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii. Measurements - outcomes Outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint in this study is the difference in the change in AaDO2 over the&#xD;
      treatment course, between treatment and placebo groups. The secondary endpoints include&#xD;
      partial pressure of arterial oxygen (paO2), exhaled NO, diffusion lung capacity for carbon&#xD;
      monoxide (DLCO), cardiac output (CO), total peripheral resistance (TPR), pulmonary artery&#xD;
      systolic pressure (PAP) (on echocardiogram), endotoxin levels, endothelin-1 (ET-1) levels,&#xD;
      MELD score (model for end-stage liver disease) (based on creatinine, bilirubin and INR),&#xD;
      baseline dyspnea index (BDI), transitional dyspnea index (TDI), and Chronic Respiratory&#xD;
      Disease Questionnaire (CRQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of Outcomes Please see attached &quot;procedure table,&quot; and &quot;data collection sheet.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once randomized, subjects will undergo initial assessment at time 0 (week 0), with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. ABG (pO2, AaDO2)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. pulmonary function tests: exhaled NO, DLCO&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. BP, echocardiogram: CO, TPR, PAP&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. blood tests: INR, bilirubin, creatinine (MELD score), liver enzymes (ALT, AST, ALP,&#xD;
           bilirubin), albumin, endotoxin level, ET-1 levels&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. questionnaires: BDI/TDI, CRQ&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. history and physical exam by study physician&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of these measures will be repeated after 4 weeks (end of first treatment course), 8 weeks&#xD;
      (before start of next treatment course), and 12 weeks (end of second treatment course). In&#xD;
      addition, ABG and exhaled NO alone will be repeated at 2 weeks and 10 weeks (midway through&#xD;
      each treatment period). Finally, blood (40 ml) will be drawn at time 0, 4, 8, 12 weeks and&#xD;
      stored for measurement of future variables.&#xD;
