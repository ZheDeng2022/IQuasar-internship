      Healthy volunteers and patients with diseases that involve problems clearing mucus from the&#xD;
      lungs will be examined and tested to better understand the reasons for recurring lung&#xD;
      infections in these patients and to try to develop better ways to diagnose and treat them.&#xD;
      The study will also try to identify the genes responsible for these diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers 18 years of age and older and patients 2 years of age or older with&#xD;
      suspected primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), variant cystic fibrosis (CF) or&#xD;
      pseudohypoaldosteronism (PHA) may be eligible for this study. Patients enrolled in the&#xD;
      Natural History Study of Nontuberculous Mycobacteria at NIH or other NIH natural history&#xD;
      protocols may also be enrolled. Participants undergo the following tests and procedures&#xD;
      during a 1-day visit at the NIH Clinical Center, as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients and normal volunteers have the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examination and review of medical and genetic history and family genetic&#xD;
           history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lung function test and measurement of oxygen saturation level.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nitric oxide measurement to measure the amount of nitric oxide production in the nose: A&#xD;
           small tube is placed in the nose while the subject breathes through the mouth into a&#xD;
           cardboard tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients have the following additional procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests for liver and kidney function, blood count, immunoglobulins and pregnancy&#xD;
           test (where appropriate).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood test or buccal scrape (brushing the inside of the cheek) to obtain DNA to look for&#xD;
           gene mutations that cause PCD, CF or PHA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Scrape biopsy of cell lining the inside of the nose: A small toothpick-sized plastic&#xD;
           stick with a tiny cup on the end is used to get nasal lining cells to look at the cilia&#xD;
           (hair-like structures that move mucus).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Semen analysis (in some men) to test sperm tail function or structure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients suspected of having a variant of CF or PHA, including nontuberculous mycobacterial&#xD;
      lung disease, have the following additional procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sweat chloride test: A medicine is placed on the arm to produce sweat; then, a very low&#xD;
           level of electric current is applied for 5 to 12 minutes. Sweat is collected in a&#xD;
           plastic tube and tested for salt content.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood draw for CF genetic testing, if necessary, and to measure levels of the enzyme&#xD;
           trypsin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Saliva collection to measure sodium and chloride content.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nasal potential difference to measure the electrical activity of the cells lining the&#xD;
           inside of the nose: A soft plastic tube filled with a salt solution is passed into the&#xD;
           nasal passage and a sterile needle is placed under the skin of the arm. This test&#xD;
           provides information about how the lining of the nose is able to get used to changes in&#xD;
           temperature and humidity. (Normal volunteers also have this test.)&#xD;

      Background: Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are ubiquitous environmental organisms that&#xD;
      have been increasingly associated with human disease, commonly involving the lung. Post&#xD;
      menopausal Caucasian women seem particularly predisposed to the development of peripheral&#xD;
      nodules and dilated airways (bronchiectasis) associated with these organisms. These women&#xD;
      have distinguishing body characteristics of being taller and thinner than age and gender&#xD;
      matched controls yet have no identifiable systemic immune defects. There is, however,&#xD;
      considerable overlap with genetic disorders of mucociliary clearance such as cystic fibrosis&#xD;
      (CF) and primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). The Genetic Diseases of Mucociliary Clearance&#xD;
      Consortium (GDMCC) is one of 10 consortia in the Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network&#xD;
      formed under the Office of Rare Diseases in collaboration with NCRR, NICHD, NINDS, NIAMS,&#xD;
      NIDDK, NHLBI in response to the Rare Diseases Act of 2002. The GDMCC is comprised of 5&#xD;
      geographically-dispersed clinical research sites that are designed to study rare diseases&#xD;
      which involve defects in clearance of mucus secretions from the airways (defective&#xD;
      &quot;mucociliary clearance&quot;). These sites will collaborate in diagnostic, genetic, and other&#xD;
      studies in patients with impairments of mucociliary clearance, including primary ciliary&#xD;
      dyskinesia (PCD), variant cystic fibrosis (CF), and pseudohypoaldosteronism (PHA). These&#xD;
      studies are also applicable to diseases where altered airways clearance may play a primary or&#xD;
      contributory role such as nontuberculous mycobacterial lung disease, chronic granulomatous&#xD;
      disease, and the hyper-IgE syndromes. Disorders such as PCD, CF, and PHA reflect genetic&#xD;
      defects in airway host-defense, and typically result in chronic infection of the airways.&#xD;
      Patients with these disorders of the conducting airways and sinuses have delayed (or&#xD;
      incorrect) diagnoses, because diagnostic tests are not readily available. These patients may&#xD;
      also have sub-optimal management of their clinical disease, because the cause of these&#xD;
      disorders is not well-defined, and treatment regimens are usually not driven by&#xD;
      evidence-based medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims: The major aim of this study is to employ a systematic approach to the diagnostic and&#xD;
      functional evaluation of these patients with chronic airways disease in individual patients,&#xD;
      better define host susceptibility to infections from environmental organisms such as the&#xD;
      nontuberculous mycobacteria, and potentially lead to the development of better diagnostic&#xD;
      techniques, including genetic testing. In addition, we will compare/contrast clinical&#xD;
      features (phenotype) across these disorders. A rigorous cross-sectional comparison of the&#xD;
      clinical features will provide better understanding of the clinical disease of these&#xD;
      disorders; in turn this will lead not only to a better standard of clinical care, but will&#xD;
      also assist in the identification of novel therapeutic approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This is a cross-sectional diagnostic / mechanistic protocol to investigate airway&#xD;
      host-defenses. The patient populations for these studies include individuals with recurring&#xD;
      airway infections such as those with nontuberculous mycobacteria lung disease who may have&#xD;
      defective airway host defenses as a predisposing factor, individuals carrying a tentative&#xD;
      diagnosis of the three known genetic disorders of mucociliary clearance (PCD, variant CF, or&#xD;
      PHA), and individuals suspected to have one of these disorders but with inadequate or&#xD;
      inconclusive diagnostic tests. Individuals in this latter category must have a preliminary&#xD;
      clinical evaluation to evaluate for other more common disorders that may have similar&#xD;
      manifestations including classical CF, immunodeficiency, asthma, and severe gastroesophageal&#xD;
      reflux. The evaluation will include a detailed assessment of clinical features; specialized&#xD;
      laboratory measurements such as nasal potential difference to evaluate the function of&#xD;
      chloride and sodium channels associated with CF and PHA, nasal biopsy specimens and nasal&#xD;
      nitric oxide measurements to assess cilia structure and function which are abnormal in PCD;&#xD;
      and genetic studies to identify disease - causing mutations in genes associated with CF, PCD,&#xD;
      and PHA.&#xD;

        There are approximately 100 patients who have been referred to the Clinical Center at NIH,&#xD;
        or who have contacted us directly for evaluation of nontuberculous mycobacterial lung&#xD;
        disease. Most of these are post- menopausal Caucasian women. Some had known diagnoses of CF&#xD;
        or PCD at the time of referral and others have been subsequently diagnosed with these&#xD;
        disorders after evaluation here. This population likely reflects a concentrated source&#xD;
        population of potential cases of PCD and @@@variant CF to feed into the Consortium.&#xD;
        Additionally, the Clinical Center will serve as a referral site for cases of suspected PCD,&#xD;
        variant CF, and PHA who don't necessarily have nontuberculous mycobacterial infections.&#xD;
        These referrals will likely be concentrated in the National Capital Area and constitute a&#xD;
        minority of the patients evaluated on the protocol.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Overview: Inclusion criteria reflect the two-fold purpose of this protocol. It is primarily&#xD;
        intended to evaluate the cohort of patients followed at the NIH Clinical Center under&#xD;
        Protocol 01-I-0202, Natural History, Genetics, Phenotype, and Treatment of Mycobacterial&#xD;
        Infections, and in this regard, the inclusion criteria mirror those of that protocol.&#xD;
        Secondly it is part of the multicenter collaborative protocol as a participating site in&#xD;
        the Genetic Disorders of Mucociliary Clearance Consortium, one of the Rare Disease Clinical&#xD;
        Consortia sponsored by the Office of Rare Diseases. There is a clear-cut need for&#xD;
        geographically dispersed centers to have expertise in the diagnostic evaluation and&#xD;
        treatment of patients with rare diseases of the airways, including patients with suspected&#xD;
        PCD, non-classical or variant CF, and PHA. The 5 sites will perform rigorous diagnostic&#xD;
        evaluations utilizing innovative, but standardized methods (SOPs contained in Manual of&#xD;
        Operations). As a participating site in the Consortium, we will cast a broad net to include&#xD;
        as many participants as feasible. This will include a multi-center standardized diagnostic&#xD;
        evaluation and clinical evaluation, giving us a better chance to define the clinical&#xD;
        spectrum of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The criteria for participants to enter this study mandates that each patient either be&#xD;
        enrolled in the 01-I-0202, Natural History, Genetics, Phenotype, and Treatment of&#xD;
        Mycobacterial Infections or related NIH Natural History Protocol, or if referred as part of&#xD;
        the Consortium, have received a standard (current clinical practice) diagnostic evaluation&#xD;
        that includes testing for asthma, severe gastroesophageal reflux and/or classic CF, prior&#xD;
        to enrolling in the Consortium study. Healthy adult control participants will be enrolled&#xD;
        for comparison assessment of noninvasive nasal nitric oxide and nasal potential difference&#xD;
        measurements only. The health status of these control participants will be assessed with&#xD;
        the standardized clinical history, family history, physical exam including height and&#xD;
        weight, vital signs, oximetry, and spirometry measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        To enter the study, individuals with a suspected mucociliary clearance defect (n=100) must&#xD;
        be age 2 years or older and meet one of the 4 following profiles:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Have known or suspected nontuberculous mycobacterial lung disease and enrolled in&#xD;
             Protocol 01-I-0202, Natural History, Genetics, Phenotype, and Treatment of&#xD;
             Mycobacterial Infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Have high suspicion for the diagnosis of PCD, based on ciliary ultrastructural changes&#xD;
             on EM (if performed elsewhere prior to referral) or clinical features (chronic&#xD;
             sinopulmonary disease, chronic otitis media, history of neonatal respiratory distress&#xD;
             or situs inversus), or PCD in a sibling and one of the clinical features of PCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Have chronic sino-pulmonary disease with clinical features that overlap with variant&#xD;
             CF and PCD, but with diagnostic tests to rule out classical CF (sweat Cl- testing and&#xD;
             CF gene mutation screening). This may include patients with other known immune&#xD;
             deficiencies such as chronic granulomatous disease followed on NIH natural history&#xD;
             protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Known or suspected PHA (or variant PHA), which might include elevated (or borderline)&#xD;
             sweat Cl- values.&#xD;
&#xD;
        To enter the study as a healthy control (n=25), individuals must be age 18 or older and&#xD;
        free of any known disease, chronic medical conditions, family history of cystic fibrosis or&#xD;
        primary ciliary dyskinesia, or any cognitive impairment or significant disability that&#xD;
        might preclude voluntary consent or the ability to safely comply with the instructions or&#xD;
        sit through the testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Persons who cannot be evaluated at the Clinical Center or who have severe cognitive&#xD;
        impairment or other severe disability that precludes the ability to understand instructions&#xD;
        or sit/lie still for the evaluation will be excluded. Certain conditions may preclude&#xD;
        specific procedures included in the protocol, but may still allow pertinent parts of this&#xD;
        diagnostic evaluation. These conditions/procedures may include: pregnancy/Chest PA/Lat&#xD;
        x-ray; allergy to pilocarpine /sweat testing. For reversible conditions such as acute upper&#xD;
        airway infection, significant epistaxis within the prior week (not related to #2 below), or&#xD;
        lower airway infection with uncontrollable coughing, the participant may need to be&#xD;
        rescheduled upon resolution.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For nasal nitric oxide and nasal potential difference measurements or nasal mucosal scrape&#xD;
        biopsies:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Anatomic abnormality of the nose or sinuses (e.g. complete sinus blockage or&#xD;
             turbinatectomy) that precludes either the measurement of nasal nitric oxide or nasal&#xD;
             potential difference.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. A severe bleeding diathesis or condition such as hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia&#xD;
             syndrome that may predispose to significant nasal bleeding or result in severely&#xD;
             excoriated nasal mucosa.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Inability to sit still for up to 15 minutes while the nasal catheters are held on the&#xD;
             mucosal surface for transepithelial potential difference measurements. This would&#xD;
             include the presence of acute or chronic lower respiratory tract infection that&#xD;
             results in uncontrollable coughing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Diffuse skin condition that would preclude placement of the subcutaneous reference&#xD;
             electrode (butterfly needle) for nasal PD measurement.&#xD;
