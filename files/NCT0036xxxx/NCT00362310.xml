  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies have described a reduced incidence or the regression of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS)&#xD;
      in HIV-infected patients treated with the highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) that&#xD;
      contains at least one inhibitor of the HIV protease (HIV-PI) such as Indinavir. Experimental&#xD;
      studies have shown that part of the anti-KS actions of HIV-PI are not related to their&#xD;
      antiretroviral actions, but, at least in part, to their capability of blocking angiogenesis&#xD;
      and tumor growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted on HIV-negative (classical) KS patients to prove that Indinavir&#xD;
      has anti-angiogenic and anti-KS effects in humans independently of its antiretroviral&#xD;
      activity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is a rare vascular tumor affecting elderly individuals from&#xD;
      Mediterranean countries (CKS), post transplant patients and, with increased incidence and&#xD;
      aggressiveness, HIV-infected individuals (AIDS-KS). No definitive cure has been established&#xD;
      for KS and all conventional therapies result in low response rate, high toxicity and tumor&#xD;
      relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antiretroviral therapies including a HIV protease inhibitor (HIV-PI) have reduced AIDS-KS&#xD;
      incidence and induce KS regression in treated patients. This cannot be explained solely with&#xD;
      drug-mediated HIV suppression and immune reconstitution. We have shown that HIV-PI such as&#xD;
      Indinavir or Saquinavir block KS-like lesions in mice by inhibiting angiogenesis and tumor&#xD;
      cell invasion through a blockade of matrix metalloprotease 2 (MMP2) proteolytic activation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these data, a proof-of-concept clinical study on HIV-negative (classic) KS (C-KS)&#xD;
      patients was planned to prove that Indinavir has anti-angiogenic and anti-KS effects in&#xD;
      humans independently of its antiretroviral activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent concepts in the evaluation of non cytotoxic anti-cancer drugs such as anti-angiogenic&#xD;
      agents suggest novel criteria for the design of clinical studies due to the specific&#xD;
      mechanism of action of these drugs. In particular, the use of the conventional evaluation&#xD;
      criteria based on cytotoxic actions may mislead the interpretation of the therapeutic&#xD;
      efficacy of non cytotoxic agents. The study was therefore designed to compare the clinical&#xD;
      response to Indinavir in early-stage vs. late-stage KS and by relating it to key biological&#xD;
      endpoints and plasmatic drug concentrations. This was also motivated by the rareness of C-KS&#xD;
      and by ethical reasons which prevented the inclusion of a control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be treated per os with 800 mg x 2/daily of Indinavir for 12 months. Follow-up&#xD;
      will be one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of the tumor response rate (complete response, partial response, improved disease&#xD;
      and stable disease) to indinavir in the treatment of mild or severe classical KS patients;&#xD;
      Evaluation of the duration of response in indinavir-treated patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of Indinavir safety in classical KS population; Determination of the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic profile of Indinavir; Evaluation of key Kaposi's sarcoma biological endpoints&#xD;
      including markers of angiogenesis and tumor invasion, Th1 and Th2 polarization of the immune&#xD;
      response, immunoactivation, and immune responses to HHV8, herpesviruses and common pathogens.&#xD;
