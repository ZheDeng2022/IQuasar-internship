  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The efficacy of counseling to prevent infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)&#xD;
      and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) has not been definitively shown. This&#xD;
      multi-center randomized controlled trial (Project RESPECT) sought to compare the effects of 2&#xD;
      interactive HIV/STD counseling interventions with didactic prevention messages typical of&#xD;
      current practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 5758 STD clinic patients were enrolled from 5 public STD clinics (Baltimore, Md;&#xD;
      Denver, Colo; Long Beach, Calif; Newark, NJ; and San Francisco, Calif) between July 1993 and&#xD;
      September 1996. Eligible participants were heterosexual, HIV-negative patients aged 14 years&#xD;
      or older who came for full STD examinations. Using a block design, participating men and&#xD;
      women were randomzied separately to 1 of 3 individual face-to-face interventions. Arm 1&#xD;
      received &quot;enhanced counseling&quot; consisting of 4 interactive counseling sessions based on the&#xD;
      Theory of Reasoned Action and Health Belief Model. Arm 2 received &quot;brief counseling&quot;,&#xD;
      consisting of 2 interactive risk-reduction sessions based on CDC's client-centered counseling&#xD;
      model. Arms 3 and 4 each received 2 brief didactic messages about HIV/STD prevention messages&#xD;
      typical of current care at that time. Participants assigned to Arms 1, 2, and 3 were actively&#xD;
      followed up after enrollment with questionnaires at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months and STD laboratory&#xD;
      examinations and tests at 6 and 12 months. An intent-to-treat analysis was used to compare&#xD;
      interventions. Arm 4 participants were followed passively to determine potential effects of&#xD;
      active study follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main outcome measures were self-reported condom use and new diagnoses of STDs (gonorrhea,&#xD;
      chlamydia, syphilis, HIV) defined by laboratory tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results: At the 3- and 6-month follow-up visits, self-reported 100% condom use was higher&#xD;
      (P&lt;.05) in both the enhanced counseling and brief counseling arms compared with participants&#xD;
      in the didactic messages arm. Through the 6-month interval, 30% fewer participants had new&#xD;
      STDs in both the enhanced counseling (7.2%; P = .002) and brief counseling (7.3%;P=.005) arms&#xD;
      compared with those in the didactic messages arm (10.4%). Through the 12-month study, 20%&#xD;
      fewer participants in each counseling intervention had new STDs compared with those in the&#xD;
      didactic messages arm (P = .008). Consistently at each of the 5 study sites, STD incidence&#xD;
      was lower in the counseling intervention arms than in the didactic messages intervention arm.&#xD;
      Reduction of STD was similar for men and women and greater for adolescents and persons with&#xD;
      an STD diagnosed at enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subset analyses found that&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these results, we conclude that short counseling interventions using personalized&#xD;
      risk reduction plans can increase condom use and prevent new STDs. Effective counseling can&#xD;
      be conducted even in busy public clinics.&#xD;
