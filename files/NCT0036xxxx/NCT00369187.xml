    <textblock>
      This Phase IV, dose escalation, within-patient controlled study of pharmacokinetics (PK),&#xD;
      safety and tolerability compares a single dose administration of a large protein molecule&#xD;
      without recombinant human hyaluronidase (rHuPH20) to a single dose administration of the&#xD;
      large molecule with escalating doses of rHuPH20. The study hypothesizes that an optimal dose&#xD;
      of rHuPH20 will increase the bioavailability of large molecule drug administration.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Males or females at least 18 years of age with RA treated with MTX who have been&#xD;
             treated with:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  co-injected large molecule protein for at least two cycles, and&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  have had stable disease with no symptom flares in the previous 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) within normal range within 7 days prior to entry in the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Adequate venous access in at least one extremity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. A negative pregnancy test (if female of child-bearing potential) within 7 days prior&#xD;
             to entry in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Decision-making capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Signed, written IRB-approved informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Unacceptable toxicity to the large molecule protein, or contraindication to or other&#xD;
             reason to not continue the large molecule protein per the package insert (e.g., active&#xD;
             or latent tuberculosis, chronic or localized infections, or concurrent treatment with&#xD;
             anakinra).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. History of active tuberculosis, or known positive tuberculin skin test unless the&#xD;
             patient has successfully completed a nine-month course of isoniazid therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Concurrent use of any disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug except the large molecule&#xD;
             protein and MTX.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Any anticipation that the dose of the large molecule protein or MTX would be changed&#xD;
             within 4 weeks following entry in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Known allergy to hyaluronidase or any hyaluronidase product.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Known allergy to bee or vespid venom.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Contraindication to IV heparin lock or known hypersensitivity to heparin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Edema, infection, or any other lower extremity or pelvic disorder that might affect&#xD;
             subcutaneous absorption from the thigh.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Presence of any other medical condition that would present an unacceptable safety risk&#xD;
             to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Participation in a study of any investigational drug or device within 30 days of&#xD;
             enrollment in this study.&#xD;
