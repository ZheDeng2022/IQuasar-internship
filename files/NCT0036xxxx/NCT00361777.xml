    <textblock>
      This study will test the accuracy of screening tests for Cushing s syndrome in overweight&#xD;
      people with signs of the disorder. Cushing s syndrome is a rare disorder caused by excess&#xD;
      production of the hormone cortisol. Patients may have various problems, such as weight gain,&#xD;
      high blood pressure, diabetes, infections, mood problems, trouble concentrating, and&#xD;
      increased blood clotting. These symptoms are seen in many other disorders as well,&#xD;
      complicating the diagnosis. The reliability of tests currently used to diagnose Cushing s&#xD;
      syndrome is not known. To test their accuracy, subjects in this study who test positive for&#xD;
      Cushing s syndrome will be evaluated at NIH for 2 years to either confirm or refute the&#xD;
      laboratory results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients between 18 and 75 years of age who are being treated at the George Washington&#xD;
      University Weight Management Program (GWUWMP) may participate in this study. Candidates will&#xD;
      be screened with a medical history, physical examination, measurement of body fat, blood&#xD;
      tests, and oral glucose tolerance test. They will also complete a symptoms checklist and&#xD;
      quality of life questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be tested for Cushing s syndrome with a saliva collection, 24-hour urine&#xD;
      collection, and dexamethasone suppression test (DST). For the DST they will take 1 mg of&#xD;
      dexamethasone at night and report to GWUWMP the next morning for a blood draw. All specimens&#xD;
      blood, saliva, and urine will be tested for cortisol levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People whose test results are abnormal will be seen at the NIH outpatient clinic for a&#xD;
      medical history, physical examination, and blood tests; bedtime saliva collection; two&#xD;
      24-hour urine collections; and a 2-day 2-mg DST, followed by administration of&#xD;
      corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). CRH is a naturally occurring hormone that causes&#xD;
      cortisol levels to rise. Pre-treatment with dexamethasone prevents CRH from causing an&#xD;
      increase in cortisol in healthy people, but not in patients with Cushing s syndrome. For the&#xD;
      2-day DST, the subject takes 0.5 mg dexamethasone every 6 hours for eight doses. Two hours&#xD;
      after the last dose, CRH is injected through a catheter (thin plastic tube) inserted into an&#xD;
      arm vein. Blood is drawn just before giving CRH to measure dexamethasone and cortisol levels&#xD;
      and after giving CRH to measure cortisol levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People whose test results are normal will not be seen further at NIH. Those with high&#xD;
      cortisol levels will have repeat urine and saliva tests every 2 to 8 weeks for up to 24&#xD;
      months, and a 1-mg DST every 3 months during routine clinic visits at GWUWMP. People whose&#xD;
      increased cortisol is found to be due to another condition besides Cushing s syndrome will be&#xD;
      referred for evaluation and possible treatment. Those diagnosed with Cushing s syndrome will&#xD;
      have standard tests to identify the tumor causing the disorder, followed by standard medical&#xD;
      and surgical treatment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Cushing's syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by a variety of clinical signs and&#xD;
      symptoms that reflect chronic exposure to hypercortisolism such as obesity, hypertension,&#xD;
      glucose intolerance, infections, psychiatric disturbance, impaired cognition and&#xD;
      hypercoagulability. Thus, it is important to screen for this treatable disorder so as to&#xD;
      prevent its associated morbidity and mortality. Because many of the signs of Cushing's&#xD;
      syndrome are common in the general population, information about the cost-effectiveness and&#xD;
      diagnostic efficiency of various screening tests would be useful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the diagnostic performance of various screening tests for Cushing's&#xD;
      syndrome in overweight patients recruited from a weight loss center who have additional signs&#xD;
      of the disorder. Patients with abnormal tests will be seen as outpatients at the NIH for&#xD;
      further evaluation for up to two years to confirm or refute the possibility that they have&#xD;
      Cushing's syndrome. Patients with the disorder will be treated.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients presenting for weight loss treatment at the GWUWMP&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have at least two of the signs and symptoms in Table 1 of the protocol, in&#xD;
        addition to weight gain. If abdominal pain, backache and/or headache are present, only one&#xD;
        of these symptoms can be used in any given patient, so that another feature must be&#xD;
        present.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Willing and able to be seen for up to 24 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        Age 18-75&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Weight more than 350 pounds, the maximum weight for radiologist examination tables&#xD;
        necessary for the evaluation of Cushing's Syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
        Renal failure, creatinine greater than 2.6, because of possible effects on dexamethasone&#xD;
        metabolism&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregnancy, because it alters interpretation of adrenal function tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        Current use of oral, inhaled or intranasal glucocorticoids or use within 30 days of study&#xD;
&#xD;
        Other significant medical disorders that may complicate participation or interpretation of&#xD;
        the results. For example, a patient with a collagen vascular disorder who has taken&#xD;
        intermittent high dose glucocorticoids, and might need to do this again, might not be&#xD;
        offered participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Use of black licorice or chewing tobacco within two weeks of the study or anticipated use&#xD;
        during the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        Use of phenytoin, barbiturate, loperamide or opiates within two weeks of the study or&#xD;
        anticipated chronic use during the study.&#xD;
