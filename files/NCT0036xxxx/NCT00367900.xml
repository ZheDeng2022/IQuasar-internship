      This study will examine the roles of diet, lifestyle, genes, and their possible interactions&#xD;
      in the cause of Parkinson's disease, using information from the NIH-AARP Diet and Health&#xD;
      Study. The NIH-AARP study was established in 1995 to examine the roles of diet and lifestyle&#xD;
      in cancer. It included 567,169 AARP members 50 or older from California, Florida, North&#xD;
      Carolina, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Louisiana, and the Atlanta and Detroit metropolitan&#xD;
      areas. In 1995, participants completed a comprehensive questionnaire on diet and a survey on&#xD;
      demographics, medications, as well as a follow-up survey in 1996 with more detailed questions&#xD;
      on lifestyle and medications, as well as cooking methods and early life dietary habits. A&#xD;
      third followup survey is currently underway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current NIH-AARP substudy on Parkinson's disease will include approximately 9,000&#xD;
      participants from the NIH-AARP study - 3,000 of whom reported being diagnosed with&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease on the most recent survey, and 6,000 control subjects. These study&#xD;
      participants provide two saliva samples for genetic analysis and may be asked to complete a&#xD;
      telephone interview. In addition, those with Parkinson's disease are asked permission to&#xD;
      review medical information regarding their diagnosis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson s disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease, affecting&#xD;
      more than 1 million elderly Americans. The causes of PD are largely unknown, but may include&#xD;
      both genetic and environmental factors. We thus propose a large study to investigate the&#xD;
      roles of diet, lifestyle, genes and their potential interactions in PD etiology, using the&#xD;
      NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study. The AARP cohort was established by investigators at NCI and&#xD;
      recruited over half a million participants in 1995 and had prospectively collected detailed&#xD;
      information on diet and lifestyle. At baseline, participants were 50 years or older and&#xD;
      included 40% women. After more than 8 years of follow-up, we expect to confirm 1,208 incident&#xD;
      PD cases with their neurologists. We will comprehensively examine the associations between&#xD;
      diet and lifestyle and risk of PD, focusing on dietary antioxidants, fat, caffeine, dairy&#xD;
      products, estrogen use, obesity, physical activity, and non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs&#xD;
      (NSAIDs). Further, we will collect saliva samples from PD patients and selected controls&#xD;
      without PD for genetic analysis. These results will be used to explore the PD associations&#xD;
      with several common genetic polymorphisms and, for the first time, their interactions with&#xD;
      several promising diet or lifestyle exposures. Many of the specific aims are novel and&#xD;
      important but have been rarely examined in previous investigations. The findings will improve&#xD;
      our understanding of the complex relationships among diet, lifestyle, gene-environment&#xD;
      interaction, and PD etiology and may potentially contribute to successful PD prevention&#xD;
      strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Examine dietary factors that may increase or decrease PD risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Examine lifestyle factors that may increase or decrease PD risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Examine genetic polymorphisms in relation to PD risk and their interactions with diet&#xD;
&#xD;
      and lifestyle on PD risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: The NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Longitudinal study for the first two study aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Nested case-control study for the third study aim.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Parameters: Physician confirmed PD diagnoses.&#xD;

        This study will be conducted within the infrastructure of the NIH-AARP Diet and Health&#xD;
        Study; every participant in the AARP cohort will be eligible for the current investigation.&#xD;
        Individuals with PD at baseline (prevalent cases) or with missing information on exposure&#xD;
        variables are still eligible for the study, but may be excluded from specific analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The proposed study does not require new recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        No children are included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The analytic sample includes all participants who respond to the follow-up questionnaires&#xD;
        and have non-missing values on the baseline surveys. Participants who reported PD before&#xD;
        exposure assessment may be excluded from the analyses.&#xD;
