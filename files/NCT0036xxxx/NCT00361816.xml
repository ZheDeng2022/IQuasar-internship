  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 15 percent of couples experience infertility, yet no abnormalities can be&#xD;
      detected in the man or the woman. In a number of couples, their embryos unexpectedly slow&#xD;
      down growth or stop growth completely. Some of these situations may be genetically&#xD;
      determined. For instance, a portion of cases may be caused by poor egg quality related to&#xD;
      genetic or functional deficiencies in heretofore unidentified human maternal effect genes. A&#xD;
      model has been developed of such unexplained fertility by creating a mouse line lacking a&#xD;
      critical maternal effect gene. (Maternal effect genes produce mRNA or proteins that&#xD;
      accumulate in the egg and are required for normal early embryonic development.) This pilot&#xD;
      project will test the hypothesis that a similar defect may be a cause of human infertility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty cubic centimeters of blood will be collected from 40 women who have a clinical history&#xD;
      consistent with a defective maternal effect gene. DNA from these blood cells will be examined&#xD;
      and stored. Some of the blood cells will be treated so that they can be frozen and grown in&#xD;
      the laboratory to produce more DNA in the future. If certain mutations are not found, that&#xD;
      means that the prevalence of such mutations is less than 10 percent, and investigators may&#xD;
      initiate another study with 100 women. If a common mutation is found in at least four&#xD;
      patients, the investigators will seek to collect DNA from 150 normal fertile control women&#xD;
      for comparison.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project is purely investigational; therefore, findings will not be shared with&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;

      The pilot investigation will examine the hypothesis that human infertility may be caused by&#xD;
      mutations in the human MATER gene. We will determine the prevalence of these mutations in a&#xD;
      select group of women who have a clinical infertility history consistent with a possible&#xD;
      defect in a maternal effect gene. After obtaining informed consent and DNA from 100 women,&#xD;
      relevant mutations in the MATER gene will be searched for by single strand conformation&#xD;
      polymorphism analysis.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women to be included in this study will have a clinical infertility history that would be&#xD;
        consistent with a possible defect in a maternal effect gene.&#xD;
&#xD;
        This includes women who meet the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. a clinical diagnosis of infertility,&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. never been pregnant, and&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. undergone treatment by in vitro fertilization and had at least 8 fertilized eggs as&#xD;
             part of at least one in vitro fertilization cycle that failed to lead to a clinical&#xD;
             pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women who have subsequently achieved a pregnancy by egg donation will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women of any age are eligible as long as they have otherwise met the inclusion criteria.&#xD;
