  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research and theory tend to agree when suggesting that certain activities done by mothers&#xD;
      have both immediate and delayed consequences for children's mental development in the first&#xD;
      years of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The everyday interaction between an infant and a caregiver can be broken down into many&#xD;
      categories. There are data linking both of these types of interaction to the mental&#xD;
      development of children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will focus on the extent to which maternal characteristics (age, employment status,&#xD;
      parenthood status, and birth order of the child) influence the relation between maternal&#xD;
      social and didactic caregiving and the social and mental development of children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mother-infant interaction will be observed when the infants are 5 months old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the children are 20 months old, measures of toddler function (e.g., ability to play and&#xD;
      language development) and maternal behavior (e.g., encouragement of attention to the&#xD;
      environment and I.Q.) will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the children are 48 months old, researchers will measure preschooler psychosocial&#xD;
      functioning (e.g., I.Q., cognitive and social competencies) and maternal behavior (e.g.,&#xD;
      &quot;scaffolding&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Understanding the relation between children's experiences as infants, toddlers, and&#xD;
      preschoolers and their eventual intellectual and social functioning is an essential part of&#xD;
      normal developmental research.&lt;TAB&gt;&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Research and theory concur in suggesting that certain maternal activities have both immediate&#xD;
      and protracted consequences for children's cognitive development in the first years of life.&#xD;
      Two conceptually distinct categories of caretaker-child interactions can be identified:&#xD;
      social and didactic. These encompass much of the everyday behavior of infants' caretakers.&#xD;
      There are data linking both of these types of behavior to cognitive development in children.&#xD;
      In previous work we have investigated these relations in early infancy using samples of&#xD;
      convenience. In the proposed study set, this work will be replicated and extended by focusing&#xD;
      on the extent to which the characteristics of maternal age, employment status, parenthood&#xD;
      status and birthorder of the child influence observed relations between maternal, social and&#xD;
      didactic caretaking on the one hand and infant, toddler, preschool age, and middle childhood,&#xD;
      and adolescent social and cognitive competencies on the other. For a subset of infants of&#xD;
      employed mothers, their substitute caregivers will be added to the sample. Understanding the&#xD;
      full range of experience for those infants with multiple caregivers is important in the&#xD;
      context of a study designed to elucidate dimensions of experience that influence social and&#xD;
      cognitive development. Naturalistic mother-infant interaction will be observed when infants&#xD;
      are 5 months old. When study participants are 20 months old, measures of toddler functioning&#xD;
      (e.g., play competence and language development) and maternal behavior (e.g., encouragement&#xD;
      of attention to the environment, I.Q.) will be obtained. At 48 months, measures of&#xD;
      preschooler psychosocial functioning (e.g., I.Q., cognitive and social competencies) and&#xD;
      maternal behavior (e.g., &quot;scaffolding&quot;) will be obtained. At age 10 and 14 years, data&#xD;
      assessing the child's adjustment, development, and functioning in multiple areas will be&#xD;
      obtained from the child, both parents, and the schoolteacher (age 10 only). Measures of&#xD;
      parental attitudes and family functioning will also be obtained. Theoretical formulations&#xD;
      about how specific parent-child interactions may contribute to cognition have challenged&#xD;
      investigators to look beyond demographic variables as markers of parental stimulation and to&#xD;
      consider specific relations between types of interactions and the acquisition of particular&#xD;
      skills at different points in time. Understanding the mechanisms linking experience in early&#xD;
      infancy through toddlerhood, the preschool years, middle childhood and early adolescence with&#xD;
      intellectual and social functioning is an essential aspect of normative developmental&#xD;
      research. In addition, examining these phenomena cross-culturally will contribute importantly&#xD;
      to our understanding of children and their families.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All subjects are normal volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        At initial recruitment, all mothers will be married women living in intact families with&#xD;
        healthy, full-term, first-born infants. Most will be living in intact families.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Prior to inclusion in the sample, basic demographic information will be obtained for all&#xD;
        study participants including substitute caregivers but excluding school teachers. Variables&#xD;
        include age, race, cultural background, primary language, marital status, SES (as assessed&#xD;
        by the Hollingshead Four-Factor Index of Social Status, 1975), and educational level. In&#xD;
        addition, for caregivers, information about their experience caring for children and about&#xD;
        the peer environment, including the number of children routinely present, their sexes, and&#xD;
        their ages, will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
        To the extent that the adolescent sample diverges from sample criteria with respect to&#xD;
        marital status and SES, appropriate controls will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects in the Argentine-American and Japanese-American project will be selected to&#xD;
        represent families high vs low on appropriate measures of acculturation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The healthy second born infants of 80 mothers already enrolled in the protocol will also be&#xD;
        recruited into the sample at the time of their birth. These infants will be selected to&#xD;
        comprise four equal groups based on the gender composition of the sibling dyad: male/male,&#xD;
        male/female, female/female, and female/male.&#xD;
