      Recent studies have shown that dysregulation of ANXA1 expression are associated with&#xD;
      tumorigenesis. Overexpression of ANXA1 protein is found in a wide variety of human tumors,&#xD;
      such as breast 10, liver 11, pancreatic cancer14 and glial tumors15. In contrast, reduced&#xD;
      levels of ANXA1 protein expression have been reported in ESCC4, 5, gastric6, breast7, head&#xD;
      and neck SCC8 and prostate cancer9. No previous study on ANXA1 protein expression has been&#xD;
      reported in the cancer of oral cavity. Furthermore, although alterations in annexin&#xD;
      expression in different types of tumors have been described, no correlation has been&#xD;
      established between ANXA1 and overall patient survival yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANXA1 is a major cellular substrate of the oncogenic tyrosine kinases such as EGF receptor&#xD;
      and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor, c-met. Previously, we have shown that expression&#xD;
      of HGF and c-met is significantly associated with the progression of OSCC in Taiwan.&#xD;
      Kermorgant et al. recently showed that PKC controls HGF-dependent c-met traffic, signaling&#xD;
      and cell migration. Prior study indicate that the mitogen phorbol-12-myristate 13-acetate&#xD;
      (PMA) induced ANXA1 nuclear translocation in a PKCdelta-dependent manner and ANXA1 nuclear&#xD;
      translocation may participate in the regulation of cellular proliferation and the&#xD;
      differentiation. However, it is not known whether HGF can induce ANXA1 nuclear translocation&#xD;
      or not and how this relates to the pathogenesis of oral SCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study we aimed to investigate whether HGF induced the translocation of ANXA1 protein&#xD;
      to the nucleus in OSCC cells and the role(s) of ANXA1 nuclear localization in the&#xD;
      carcinogenesis of OSCC using an immunohistochemical technique. The data suggest a novel&#xD;
      mechanism for HGF-induced ANXA1 protein nuclear translocation that may play an important role&#xD;
      in the pathogenesis and prognosis in oral SCCs.&#xD;

      MATERIAL AND METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      After approval by the Hospital Review Board, we obtained formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded&#xD;
      specimens from 115 patients with primary oral SCC and 66 patients with oral ED at the&#xD;
      Department of Pathology, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan. Diagnosis of&#xD;
      oral SCC and ED was based on histological examination of hematoxylin and eosin-stained tissue&#xD;
      sections. All patients received total surgical excision of the lesions at the Department of&#xD;
      Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery or Department of Otolaryngology, National Taiwan University&#xD;
      Hospital during the period from 1997 to 2004. Specimens were obtained from either incisional&#xD;
      biopsies or total surgical excision of the lesions. If lymph node was diagnosed as positive&#xD;
      for SCC, neck dissection and postoperative radiation therapy were also included in the&#xD;
      treatment protocol. No patient had received any cancer therapy before initial biopsies.&#xD;
      Details of the patients' oral habits, including daily consumption of AQs, cigarettes, and&#xD;
      alcohol as well as the duration of these habits, were also recorded in the medical chart.&#xD;
      Twenty biopsy specimens of normal oral mucosa (NOM) were obtained from non-AQ-chewers and&#xD;
      non-smokers during extraction of impacted permanent lower third molars after obtaining&#xD;
      informed consent, and used as the healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cell culture Dulbecco's modifed Eagle's medium (DMEM), and fetal bovine serum (FBS) were&#xD;
      purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD,USA). PD98059, Ly294002, SB203580&#xD;
      and Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) were products of Sigma (St Louis, MO, USA). Anti-ANX-1&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody was purchased from BD Biosciences (Lexington, KY, USA). Cell culture SAS&#xD;
      cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, penicillin (100&#xD;
      UAmL)1), and streptomycin (100 lgAmL)1) at 37 o C under 5% CO2 atmosphere. For Western blot&#xD;
      analysis, cells were seeded into 10 cm dishes at 2 x 106 cells per dish. After 18-24 hr,&#xD;
      cells were further grown in the same medium supplemented without FBS for 24 h. Serum-starved&#xD;
      cells were treated with HGF in the indicated times. For immunostaining, 2 x 105 cells grown&#xD;
      on cover slides (22 x 22 mm) were starved for 24 h before stimulation with HGF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-treatment with PD098059, Ly294002 and SB203580 The cells were plated overnight in&#xD;
      complete medium and then washed. The cells cultured in serum-free DMEM were pre-treated with&#xD;
      50M PD098059 (inhibitor of ERK), 30 M Ly294002( inhibitor of PI-3 kinase) and 20 M&#xD;
      SB203580(inhibitor of p38) for 3 hrs respectively, and then they were treated with 40ng HGF&#xD;
      for 3hrs. The cells were checked by immunohistochemistry and Western blot with ANXA1&#xD;
      antibody.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunocytochemistry(IHC) Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor samples were assessed for&#xD;
      annexin A1 expression.The IHC procedures was followed as the reference18, The monoclonal&#xD;
      primary antibody anti-Annexin AI(1:600 dilution), directed against the the N-terminus of&#xD;
      annexin 1 were obtained from a signal source (BD Biosciences). Protein translocation as&#xD;
      determined by two pathologists (Jeng and Lin) using immunohistochemistry was scored as&#xD;
      negative (score 0), positive (score 1) and cytoplasmic protein expression was scored as&#xD;
      negative (score 0), weak (score 1), moderate (score 2), or strong (score 3) using a system&#xD;
      that has been previously validated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAS cells grown on cover slides were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 15 min and&#xD;
      permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS (0.58M Na2HPO4, 0.17 M Na H2PO4, 0.68 M NaCl,&#xD;
      pH=7.4)(PBST) for 5 min. After washing the cells with PBST three times, the cells were&#xD;
      blocked for 30 min in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin. Immunostaining was performed by&#xD;
      incubation with anti-ANX-1 monoclonal antibody (1:800 dilution) for 2h. After washing the&#xD;
      cells with PBST three times, the cells were incubated with TRITC-conjugated rabbit&#xD;
      anti-(mouse IgG) Ig for 1 h. Cover slides were washed with PBST, mounted, and examined using&#xD;
      a Leica TCS SP2 Confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar GmBH, Germany).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cell fractionation SAS cells were seeded into 10cm dishes at 2x 106 cells/dish and cultured&#xD;
      in DMEM for 18-24 h. The cells were starved for 24 h in serum-free media. After treatment&#xD;
      with HGF for a given time, the cells were harvested and washed with ice-cold PBS. The cells&#xD;
      were then resuspended in 100 lL of lysis buffer (10 mM Hepes, 10 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM&#xD;
      EGTA, 1% NP-40, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl uoride, 0.1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mM sodium&#xD;
      orthovanadate, and protease inhibitors) and incubated on ice for 10 min. The nuclei were&#xD;
      collected by centrifugation at 2000 g for 5 min at 4 o C. The supernatant was collected as a&#xD;
      cytosolic fraction. Protein concentration of each sample was determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evalution of annexin A1 Protein Expression The distributions of ANXA1 expression in four&#xD;
      categories (0-25%, 26-50%, 51-75% and 76-100%) with nuclear translocation were firstly showed&#xD;
      by clinicopathological parameters of the oral ED and SCCs and the correlations between mean&#xD;
      levels of expression and these clinicopathological parameters were further examined using&#xD;
      ANOVA. The Kaplan-Meier product-limit method was used to assess the prognostic significance&#xD;
      of the ANXA1 nuclear staining in cancer cells as well as other clinicopathological&#xD;
      parameters. Comparison of cumulative survival between groups was performed using the log-rank&#xD;
      test with the Statistica program (StatSoft Inc., USA). Multivariable analyses were performed&#xD;
      with Cox regression model to assess additional prognostic values of the different variables&#xD;
      using SAS 8.0 (SAS Institute Inc., USA). A P-value of less than 0.05 was considered as&#xD;
      statistically significant.&#xD;
