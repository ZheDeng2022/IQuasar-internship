  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD) depend on medication for relief of motor symptoms, and&#xD;
      for this reason are often assumed to medicate very carefully. Overall, medication adherence&#xD;
      is very good, but a subset of 15 to 20% of cases take less than 80% of the total prescribed&#xD;
      dose. However, irregular timing of drug ingestion is almost universal, perhaps contributed by&#xD;
      fluctuating symptoms and drug regimen complexity. Pulsatile dopaminergic stimulation in the&#xD;
      basal ganglia is implicated in the development and manifestation of motor complications of&#xD;
      advancing PD. Irregular medication intake is likely to contribute to peaks and troughs in&#xD;
      serum and brain drug levels. In other diseases, patient adherence to prescribed medication&#xD;
      improves through simplifying drug regimens, providing additional education, counselling and&#xD;
      behavioural approaches and providing reminder packaging. We tested the effect on the timing&#xD;
      of medicine ingestion of an educational approach, in which patients were given detailed&#xD;
      additional information about the continuous dopaminergic theory.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients attending a regional movement disorder clinic with idiopathic PD (by UK Brain Bank&#xD;
      criteria) and prescribed one or more antiparkinson drug (including dopamine agonist or&#xD;
      levodopa) were invited to participate. Patients who were unable to manipulate the electronic&#xD;
      pill monitoring bottles, or whose compliance would be adversely affected by using the&#xD;
      electronic pill monitoring bottles (e.g. those reliant on a compliance aid) were excluded.&#xD;
      The study received ethics approval and signed consent was obtained. During the study&#xD;
      medication was adjusted according to clinical need. The increase in levodopa equivalent units&#xD;
      during the study period was calculated according to established formula[12].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline assessments of unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS), Hoehn and Yahr,&#xD;
      Schwab and England, mini-mental state examination, geriatric depression scale and quality of&#xD;
      life score (PDQ 39) were performed. Clinical scoring was blind to patient group and performed&#xD;
      in an 'on' state. The UPDRS 3 and adverse events were recorded at each visit. The quality of&#xD;
      life score (PDQ 39) was repeated at the final visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All antiparkinson drugs were monitored during two 3 month periods (before and after the&#xD;
      educational intervention) using electronic monitoring pill bottles (MEMSÂ®, Aardex,&#xD;
      Switzerland), a device which records the time and date of bottle opening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomly assigned (computer generated and placed in opaque envelopes) to the active&#xD;
      (counselled) group were given verbal and written information about the continuous&#xD;
      dopaminergic theory, and written advice on optimal medicine timing tailored to their own drug&#xD;
      regimen. The counselling explained that in health, brain dopamine is constant, and that&#xD;
      fluctuations from Parkinson's medications should be minimised to simulate normal dopamine&#xD;
      levels. Control patients received standard care, but also had medication intake monitored&#xD;
      using the MEMS device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timing compliance (the percentage of doses taken at the correct time interval) was calculated&#xD;
      using time intervals which optimise the pharmacokinetic profile, plus a 25% allowance, eg. 3&#xD;
      times daily medication is satisfactory at between 6 and 10 hours. Selegiline 5mg twice daily&#xD;
      was excluded from analysis as the second dose is taken at lunchtime to avoid sleep&#xD;
      disturbance.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men or Women between 18 and 80 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has idiopathic Parkinson's Disease according to Brain Bank criteria. Reference&#xD;
             Hughes A J, Daniel S E, Kilford L, Lees A J, Accuracy of Clinical Diagnosis of&#xD;
             Idiopathic Parkinson's disease; A clinical Pathological study of 100 cases, JNNP 1992,&#xD;
             55(3): 181 - 184&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is on stable doses of anti-Parkinson's disease medication, which are not&#xD;
             expected to change during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is taking levodopa and/or dopamine agonist treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient (assisted by a carer where appropriate) is able to take their medication using&#xD;
             the MEMS (electronic monitoring) containers.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients using a dosette box or similar device for their medication are willing to use&#xD;
             the MEMS containers for their PD medication&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The investigator judges that the patient's care and symptom control will not be&#xD;
             adversely affected by entering the study and using the MEMS device.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is taking anti-Parkinson's disease therapy intermittently or on &quot;as required&quot;&#xD;
             basis (such as rescue therapy for off periods). Intermittent Domperidone is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe co-morbid condition such as severe heart, liver, or kidney disease or cancer&#xD;
             diagnosis where the co-morbid condition is of greater health significance than the&#xD;
