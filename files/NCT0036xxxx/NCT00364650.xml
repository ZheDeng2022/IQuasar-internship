  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that the administration of a combination of high numbers of probiotic bacteria&#xD;
      will maintain normal bowel function and significantly moderate or obviate Immunosuppression&#xD;
      Associated Diarrhea following kidney transplantation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Immunosuppression following organ transplantation is associated with a myriad of&#xD;
      gastrointestinal complications including severe diarrhea. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is the&#xD;
      immunosuppressant most often associated with this plaguing symptom. A retrospective study of&#xD;
      patients from 10 US transplant centers receiving MMF immunosuppression after kidney&#xD;
      transplantation showed that nearly 50% of patients suffered from at least one&#xD;
      gastrointestinal symptom within the first 6 months after transplantation. (Tierce 2005) The&#xD;
      majority of these patients have diarrhea. However, Immunosuppression Associated Diarrhea&#xD;
      (IAD) is often observed in association with other immunosuppressive agents as well. It is the&#xD;
      investigator's observation that IAD is equally problematic whether the immunosuppressive&#xD;
      regimen includes MMF or not. When IAD is severe it can be difficult for the recipient to&#xD;
      maintain adequate levels of immunosuppression. Not infrequently, IAD is so distressing that a&#xD;
      recipient's immunosuppressive medications are tapered, changed or stopped. During these times&#xD;
      of drug manipulation, patients are at risk for early acute rejection. Approximately 30% of&#xD;
      renal transplant patients who have their MMF regimen adjusted or discontinued suffer an&#xD;
      episode of acute rejection. Reversing a rejection episode is expensive and adds significant&#xD;
      risks for the recipient and long-term allograft survival. Thus, a strategy to support and&#xD;
      maintain normal healthy bowel function moderating or obviating IAD is highly desirable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repopulation of the normal intestinal microflora in kidney transplant patients after kidney&#xD;
      transplantation may maintain normal bowel function. This study is designed to test the&#xD;
      hypothesis that the administration of a food supplement probiotic consisting of high amounts&#xD;
      of six strains of lactic acid bacteria normally found in the human colon will favorably&#xD;
      support and maintain bowel function moderating or obviating IAD.&#xD;
