  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study offers evaluation and treatment for patients with a spectrum of acute and chronic&#xD;
      pain syndromes. The protocol is not designed to test new treatments; rather, patients will&#xD;
      receive current standard of care treatments. The purposes of the study are: 1) to allow&#xD;
      physicians in NIDCR's Pain and Neurosensory Mechanisms Branch to gain more knowledge about&#xD;
      treating acute and chronic pain and possibly identify new avenues of research in this area;&#xD;
      and 2) to establish a pool of patients who may be eligible for new studies as they are&#xD;
      developed. (Participants in this protocol will not be required to join a new study; the&#xD;
      decision will be voluntary.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 12 years of age and older with an acute or chronic pain syndrome may be eligible for&#xD;
      this study. Women of childbearing potential and women who are pregnant or breastfeeding will&#xD;
      not be enrolled in this study, drugs may have unknown or untoward side effects on the baby.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will provide a medical history, as well as occupational and social information.&#xD;
      They will have a standard neurological examination, including a test of cognitive (thinking)&#xD;
      abilities, muscular function, reflexes and sensory examination. The latter involves testing&#xD;
      with a pin placed on the surface of the skin. Participants will also have routine blood tests&#xD;
      and will fill out questionnaires on their daily functioning and psychological well being.&#xD;
      Additional procedures may include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and possible&#xD;
      referral to a psychiatrist for evaluation of depression or emotional difficulties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be treated according to their individual pain problem. Treatments may&#xD;
      include medicines, exercises, physical therapy, nerve blocks and dietary changes. Medicines&#xD;
      given in this study are commonly used by doctors to treat pain, but for many, there is little&#xD;
      research to back up their use. This study will provide information on the effectiveness of&#xD;
      these treatments. Participants will keep a daily log in which they rate their pain, record&#xD;
      any procedures they undergo outside the study, such as injections and exercises, and record&#xD;
      medication side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in the study will end based on the researcher's assessment of the patient's&#xD;
      response to treatment. The study doctor will provide the patient's referring doctor a report&#xD;
      of medications or other treatments used in the study. At the last visit, patients will fill&#xD;
      out the same questionnaires they filled out during the first visit.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The function of this protocol is to allow the clinic pain research fellows to gain additional&#xD;
      knowledge in the management of acute and chronic pain. Patients enrolled in this protocol&#xD;
      will be evaluated and treated according to available procedures and therapeutic modalities&#xD;
      used in clinical practice. The evaluation and treatment of these patients may lead to ideas&#xD;
      for future protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By allowing for the care of persons with a spectrum of pain syndromes, this protocol will be&#xD;
      valuable for the training of the pain fellow as well. The pain group at the NIDCR is free to&#xD;
      choose those diseases that interest them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in this patient evaluation and treatment protocol will be evaluated for potential&#xD;
      eligibility in any of the new clinical studies of the Pain and Neurosensory Mechanisms branch&#xD;
      of the NIDCR as they are developed. If eligible, patients may be asked to participate in the&#xD;
      new protocol. However they will not be required to enter any new protocol and their decision&#xD;
      to participate will be entirely voluntary.&#xD;
