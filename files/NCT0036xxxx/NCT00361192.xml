      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Temporal arteritis (TA) is the most common primary vasculitis in the adult population. TA is&#xD;
      a systemic multi-organ disease but primarily involves the cranial arteries, especially the&#xD;
      temporal artery. The signs and symptoms of the disease are variable and therefore the&#xD;
      differential diagnosis is often difficult. The annual incidence of the disease in the&#xD;
      population above the age of 50 in Jerusalem is about 10 per 100,000.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosis is based on the clinical findings and confirmed by biopsy of the temporal artery,&#xD;
      positive for histologic findings of arteritis. Though the biopsy procedure is minor and can&#xD;
      be accomplished under local anesthesia, it is not without morbidity. Along with minor pain,&#xD;
      more serious complications - facial nerve injury, ptosis, stroke, and local necrosis of skin&#xD;
      - have been reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A negative biopsy does not completely rule out the diagnosis of TA because of the segmental&#xD;
      nature of the inflammation. Even if one removes an appropriate length of artery (usually 1-2&#xD;
      cm) the possibility exists that an involved segment may not have been included and the biopsy&#xD;
      will be reported as normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has recently been reported that color Doppler ultrasonography can be used to diagnose TA.&#xD;
      Arterial inflammation causing peri-vascular edema appearing as a &quot;dark halo&quot; and segmental&#xD;
      stenosis of the temporal artery are characteristic ultrasound findings suggestive of TA. If&#xD;
      there is no dark halo sign, a diagnosis of TA cannot be supported and temporal artery biopsy&#xD;
      can be avoided in most of these patients. The presence of the dark halo sign has a positive&#xD;
      predictive value of only 50%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As noted above the disease is characterized by segmental involvement of the artery and to&#xD;
      avoid a false negative biopsy, excision of up to 3cm of the artery has been recommended,&#xD;
      thereby increasing the morbidity, and leading patients to refuse the procedure. Use of&#xD;
      ultrasound-guided biopsy of the artery may dramatically raise the sensitivity and specificity&#xD;
      of the biopsy and reduce the requirement for excising long segments of artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to examine the use of ultrasound-guided biopsy of the temporal&#xD;
      artery in the diagnosis of TA. Ultrasound-guided biopsy will be compared to the standard&#xD;
      random biopsy generally in use. Appropriate statistical methods will be employed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Vascular Laboratory in Shaare Zedek Medical Center performs approximately 200 Doppler&#xD;
      ultrasound studies of the temporal artery each year at the request of community-based&#xD;
      physicians. Some of these patients are then also referred for biopsy of the temporal artery&#xD;
      at various surgical facilities in the city. In collaboration with the referring physician,&#xD;
      the patients will be offered a combined diagnostic Doppler ultrasound and guided biopsy on&#xD;
      the basis of clinical guidelines and according to the ultrasound findings as described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients suffering from signs and symptoms consistent with TA and who have not undergone&#xD;
      previous temporal artery biopsy will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients suffering from isolated polymyalgia rheumatica will be excluded. Patients who are&#xD;
      already undergoing steroid treatment will be excluded. Patients with an ultrasound study that&#xD;
      is positive for the dark halo sign will be divided into two groups on a random basis after&#xD;
      obtaining informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One group will undergo ultrasound-guided biopsy, while the other will undergo biopsy as is&#xD;
      the standard practice in our institution - a 1-2cm length of temporal artery will be excised&#xD;
      from the preauricular area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the ultrasound is negative, no biopsy will be done in the setting of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that about 50 patients will be accrued during the 6-month study period.&#xD;
      Differences in outcome will be analyzed using Fishers exact test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approval from the Helsinki committee of Shaare Zedek Medical Center has been requested.&#xD;
