  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether naltrexone, combined with brief coping&#xD;
      skills therapy, is effective in the treatment of heavy drinking.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 12-week, placebo-controlled trial of naltrexone (50 mg orally) in 163 problem&#xD;
      drinkers. Problem drinkers are those individuals whose drinking puts them at risk of a&#xD;
      variety of psychosocial and medical problems, including alcohol dependence, but who are not&#xD;
      physically dependent on alcohol. They are estimated to comprise up to 20% of the general&#xD;
      population. The study employed a factorial design in which the effects of medication&#xD;
      (naltrexone vs. placebo), schedule of medication administration (i.e., daily vs. targeted),&#xD;
      and the interaction of these factors on drinking behavior were examined. Targeted&#xD;
      administration refers to the use of medication to cope with anticipated high-risk drinking&#xD;
      situations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The daily monitoring using interactive voice response technology of mood, desire to drink,&#xD;
      perceived self-efficacy, and drinking behavior will make it possible to examine in depth the&#xD;
      processes by which the study variables exert their effects. Daily monitoring was performed&#xD;
      using automated telephone interviews, with in-person follow-up evaluations conducted at 3 and&#xD;
      6 months post-treatment to provide a measure of the durability of treatment effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pharmacogenetic analysis based on preliminary evidence showing that a functional&#xD;
      polymorphism in the gene encoding the mu-opioid receptor (OPRM1) affects response to&#xD;
      naltrexone will serve to explore an important source of variation in the response to&#xD;
      naltrexone treatment. Exploratory analyses involving other potential genetic moderators of&#xD;
      the response to naltrexone, such as the gene encoding the delta opioid receptor (OPRD1), will&#xD;
      also be conducted, as will the correlation of genotype data with other phenotypes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Careful evaluation of the study hypotheses will provide important information on the efficacy&#xD;
      and mechanism of the effects of targeted naltrexone in problem drinkers. This study will&#xD;
      allow us to model effects across multiple levels of analysis in an effort to understand the&#xD;
      psychopharmacological mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of naltrexone in problem&#xD;
      drinkers and to apply novel genetic findings to understanding the pharmacogenetic mechanisms&#xD;
      underlying the therapeutic effects of naltrexone in problem drinkers.&#xD;
