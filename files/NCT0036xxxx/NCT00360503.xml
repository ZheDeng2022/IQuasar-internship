  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with cystic fibrosis (CF) often develop chronic pulmonary infections which are caused&#xD;
      by a variety of organisms, the most predominant being Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Antibiotics are&#xD;
      important in managing CF lung infections. Antibiotic use in CF was altered about ten years&#xD;
      ago with the approval of inhaled tobramycin, an aminoglycoside which is effective in treating&#xD;
      P. aeruginosa. A decade later, CF clinicians are increasingly concerned about the likelihood&#xD;
      of induction of aminoglycoside-resistance with prolonged use of inhaled tobramycin to treat&#xD;
      chronic P. aeruginosa airway infections. The goal of this study is to examine the current&#xD;
      microbiology and susceptibility of organisms from CF sputum, correlate it with antibiotic&#xD;
      use, and compare it with previous data.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aminoglycosides are one of the mainstays of antibiotic therapy in CF. They are administered&#xD;
      parenterally in synergistic combinations with Î²-lactam antibiotics for acute exacerbations&#xD;
      and used by inhalation as single agents for chronic maintenance therapy. It is well known in&#xD;
      CF and other chronic infections that chronic use of antibiotics results in resistance. Thus,&#xD;
      the increasing use of aminoglycosides could have dramatically changed the microbiological&#xD;
      epidemiology of CF, since it was last examined a decade ago. It will be important to&#xD;
      determine the current prevalence of antibiotic resistance in CF pathogens. Current&#xD;
      antimicrobial strategies may also be contributing to the increased rate of isolation of novel&#xD;
      and difficult to treat organisms, including intrinsically antibiotic-resistant bacteria.&#xD;
      These issues are important both for CF clinicians and for researchers developing new&#xD;
      antimicrobials to be used in CF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine if the prevalence of P. aeruginosa resistance and the prevalence of other CF&#xD;
      pathogens has changed over the past ten years, this multi-center cross-sectional study will&#xD;
      enroll a contemporary cohort of patients with CF and will compare their sputum microbiology&#xD;
      and susceptibility data with corresponding baseline data from an historical cohort consisting&#xD;
      of patients enrolled in the prior phase 3 trials of inhaled tobramycin, conducted by&#xD;
      PathoGenesis Corporation. (A Phase III Placebo Controlled Clinical Trial (PC-TNDS-002) to&#xD;
      Study the Safety and Efficacy of Tobramycin in Inhalation in Patients with Cystic Fibrosis).&#xD;
      The data set from the phase 3 trials which will be used for this research project will be&#xD;
      anonymous.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This current study will be coordinated by the CF research team at CHRMC and aims to enroll&#xD;
      520 patients at approximately 50 participating sites across the United States. The&#xD;
      contemporary cohort will include patients with CF who are ages 6 years and older and able to&#xD;
      expectorate sputum. Patients will be enrolled from many of the same CF centers that&#xD;
      participated in the phase 3 trials of inhaled tobramycin, and eligibility criteria will be&#xD;
      similar to those used in the phase 3 trials. Subjects enrolled in the contemporary cohort&#xD;
      will have a single study visit to obtain a sputum sample that will be sent to a central&#xD;
      laboratory for culture and susceptibility testing.&#xD;
