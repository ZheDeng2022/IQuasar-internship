        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or non-pregnant female subjects with a history of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid&#xD;
             arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis or other medical conditions expected to require&#xD;
             daily NSAID therapy for at least 6 months who are 18-49 years of age and have a&#xD;
             history of a documented, uncomplicated gastric or duodenal ulcer (a mucosal break of&#xD;
             at least 3 mm in diameter with depth, without any concurrent bleeding, clot or&#xD;
             perforation) within the past 5 years OR, who are 50 years of age and older (these&#xD;
             subjects do not require a history of a documented, uncomplicated gastric or duodenal&#xD;
             ulcer within the past 5 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subjects are eligible for participation in the study if they are of:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Non-childbearing potential (i.e., physiologically incapable of becoming&#xD;
                  pregnant); or,&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Childbearing potential, have a negative pregnancy test (urine) at screening, and&#xD;
                  at least one of the following applies or is agreed to by the subject:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Complete abstinence from intercourse for at least 14 days prior to first&#xD;
                       dose of study drug, throughout the study, and for 30 days after completion&#xD;
                       of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Female sterilization or sterilization of male partner; or,&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Hormonal contraception by oral route, implant, injectable, vaginal ring; or,&#xD;

                    -  Any intrauterine device (IUD) with published data showing that the lowest&#xD;
                       expected failure rate is less than 1% per year;&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Double barrier method (2 physical barriers or 1 physical barrier plus&#xD;
                       spermicide); or&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Any other method with published data showing that the lowest expected&#xD;
                       failure rate is less than 1% per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Each subject must be able to understand and comply with study procedures required of a&#xD;
             subject and is able and willing to provide written informed consent prior to any study&#xD;
             procedures being performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of hypersensitivity to omeprazole or to another proton-pump inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reaction or intolerance to any NSAID (including aspirin) and/or&#xD;
             subject has a history of NSAID-induced symptoms of asthma, rhinitis, and/or nasal&#xD;
             polyps.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in any study of an investigational treatment in the 4 weeks before&#xD;
             screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of uncontrolled acute or chronic medical illness, e.g. gastrointestinal&#xD;
             disorder, diabetes, hypertension, thyroid disorder, depression and/or infection that&#xD;
             would endanger a subject if they were to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Gastrointestinal disorder or surgery leading to impaired drug absorption.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of uncontrolled, or unstable cardio- or cerebrovascular disorder, which in&#xD;
             the investigator's opinion would endanger a subject if they were to participate in the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of any excluded concomitant medication (see Section 9.2).&#xD;

             with depth.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Screening laboratory value for ALT, AST &gt;2 times the upper limit of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Estimated creatinine clearance &lt; 30 ml/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other than noted specifically, any screening laboratory value that is clinically&#xD;
             significant in the investigator's opinion and would endanger a subject if they were to&#xD;
             participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of malignancy, treated or untreated, within the past 5 years, with the&#xD;
