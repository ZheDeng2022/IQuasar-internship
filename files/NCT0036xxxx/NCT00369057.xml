    <textblock>
      Our goal is to study the relationship between intraocular pressure during robotic&#xD;
      prostatectomy surgery and visual deficiencies/vision loss after surgery. We believe the risk&#xD;
      of vision loss from this surgery to be due to positioning during the operation, as well as&#xD;
      abdominal carbon dioxide insufflation. As robotic procedures are gaining in popularity, we&#xD;
      should determine whether they are subjecting this patient population, and perhaps more likely&#xD;
      the patient with a preoperative diagnosis of glaucoma, to an increased likelihood of&#xD;
      postoperative visual disturbance.If our hypothesis that intraocular pressure is increased in&#xD;
      these patients is confirmed, future studies will assess therapeutic modalities to maintain&#xD;
      the IOP near baseline.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The frequency of post-operative permanent vision loss has been recently estimated to be&#xD;
      1:61,0001,2 , although the majority of these cases involve surgical trauma to the eye or&#xD;
      brain. Prolonged vision loss not attributable to direct trauma has been estimated to occur&#xD;
      with a frequency of approximately 1:125,0003 and has been given a broad classification termed&#xD;
      ischemic optic neuropathy. This rare but catastrophic outcome has most commonly been&#xD;
      associated with operations performed under circumstances in which there may be increased&#xD;
      intraocular pressure (IOP), either due to positioning4 or due to insufflation of the abdomen&#xD;
      with carbon dioxide (laparoscopy).5&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two factors predisposing the robotic prostatectomy patient to an increase in IOP:&#xD;
      step head-down (Trendelenburg) position and abdominal carbon dioxide (CO2) insufflation. The&#xD;
      Trendelenburg position will increase central venous pressure within the thorax, which may&#xD;
      reduce the drainage of blood flow from the head, thus increasing IOP. The CO2 insufflation&#xD;
      may increase IOP via two mechanisms. First, by increasing intra-abdominal pressure there is a&#xD;
      further increase in intrathoracic pressure. Secondly, insufflation the CO2 may increase the&#xD;
      carbon dioxide content of the blood, to which the brain reacts by vasodilating and increasing&#xD;
      blood volume. Thus while flow into the eye is increased, flow out of the eye is decreased&#xD;
      leading to an increase in pressure inside the eye which eventually may reduce the inflow&#xD;
      enough to cause retinal or optic nerve ischemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because the pressure within the eye is an important factor in determining the blood flow to&#xD;
      the eye, prevention of a dramatic increase in IOP may make patients less vulnerable to&#xD;
      peri-operative ischemic optic neuropathy and vision loss. Because permanent vision loss is&#xD;
      such a rare event after surgery, this study will measure more subtle (and most likely,&#xD;
      temporary) vision changes (subjective blurriness, visual field deficits, decreased acuity),&#xD;
      which occur more frequently and are thus a more easily measured outcome.6&#xD;
&#xD;
      As robotic procedures are gaining in popularity, we should determine whether they are&#xD;
      subjecting this patient population, and perhaps more likely the patient with a preoperative&#xD;
      diagnosis of glaucoma, to an increased likelihood of postoperative visual disturbance.&#xD;
