      The overall aim of this project is to prospectively determine whether MRI can improve the&#xD;
      conventional neuroradiological evaluation (CT with or without cerebral angiography) of&#xD;
      patients with a spontaneous ICH or IVH. The study design will also allow us to identify the&#xD;
      added benefit of specific MR sequences and repeat MRI in the chronic stage, thereby allowing&#xD;
      us to prospectively determine their value in a consecutive series of patients. This&#xD;
      information should have a major impact on the management of these patients by providing data&#xD;
      on the diagnostic yield of routine MRI in patients presenting with a wide variety of causes&#xD;
      for ICH or IVH. These data will help guide the diagnostic evaluation and the management of&#xD;
      brain hemorrhage patients in the future.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) account for&#xD;
      at least 15% of strokes worldwide. There are many possible etiologies for spontaneous (i.e.&#xD;
      non-traumatic) ICH or IVH such as longstanding hypertension and cerebral amyloid angiopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other causes include vascular malformations, intracranial aneurysms, tumors, coagulopathies,&#xD;
      use of thrombolytic or antithrombotic drugs, cerebral venous thrombosis, hemorrhagic&#xD;
      transformation of an ischemic infarct, illicit drug use, endocarditis, and vasculitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identification of the cause of an ICH or IVH typically relies on clinical evaluation&#xD;
      supported by computer tomography (CT) with or without conventional contrast cerebral&#xD;
      angiography in selected patients. While magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has substantially&#xD;
      improved our diagnostic capabilities, the appropriate use of MRI and its effectiveness has&#xD;
      not been studied systematically in these patients. Furthermore, it is unclear whether routine&#xD;
      MRI in ICH yields clinically relevant data. For this reason routine use or MRI in patients&#xD;
      with ICH is highly variable in clinical practice. Furthermore, it is unclear whether the&#xD;
      findings detected on MRI will change management decisions regarding further diagnostic&#xD;
      testing and therapeutic options above and beyond that which can be achieved by CT and&#xD;
      cerebral angiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This question has major ramifications for the care of patients with ICH or IVH. If MRI truly&#xD;
      can categorize patients into specific diagnostic categories better than CT, this would&#xD;
      represent a major paradigm shift in the way that these patients are typically evaluated. On&#xD;
      the other hand, because of the added expense of MRI, its general use could result in a&#xD;
      substantial increase in the cost of neurological care. These added costs must result in&#xD;
      improvements in patient management in order to justify the added financial resources&#xD;
      involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall aim of this project is to prospectively determine whether MRI can improve the&#xD;
      conventional neuroradiological evaluation (CT with or without cerebral angiography) of&#xD;
      patients with a spontaneous ICH or IVH. The study design will also allow us to identify the&#xD;
      added benefit of specific MR sequences and repeat MRI in the chronic stage, thereby allowing&#xD;
      us to prospectively determine their value in a consecutive series of patients. This&#xD;
      information should have a major impact on the management of these patients by providing data&#xD;
      on the diagnostic yield of routine MRI in patients presenting with a wide variety of causes&#xD;
      for ICH or IVH. These data will help guide the diagnostic evaluation and the management of&#xD;
      brain hemorrhage patients in the future. During this 5-year study, 160 consecutive inpatients&#xD;
      presenting with a spontaneous ICH or IVH within 48 hours of symptom onset will be&#xD;
      prospectively categorized into specific hemorrhage subtypes based upon the findings on MRI.&#xD;
      We will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Prospectively assess the value of early MRI in determining hemorrhage etiology in&#xD;
           consecutive patients who present with a spontaneous ICH or IVH diagnosed by CT. We will&#xD;
           test the hypotheses that:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. MRI will more frequently yield a correct specific hemorrhage etiology than&#xD;
                conventional non-contrast CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. MRI will increase the certainty of a specific hemorrhage etiology when compared to&#xD;
                conventional non-contrast CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. MRI will affect management in patients who present with a spontaneous ICH or IVH&#xD;
                diagnosed by CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. The yield of MRI in patients with a spontaneous ICH or IVH varies among diagnostic&#xD;
                categories.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Routine use of MRI in patients with spontaneous ICH or IVH will reduce the need for&#xD;
                conventional (and invasive) cerebral angiography in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Prospectively assess the relative added value of an improved MR protocol (MRA/MRV, GRE,&#xD;
           DWI, TEDS, PROPELLER) in the evaluation and management of patients with ICH or IVH&#xD;
           determined by non-contrast CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
           We will test the hypotheses that:&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. MRI with multi-echo, multi-shot GRE sequences, MRA, MR venography (MRV), SENSE-DWI&#xD;
           and PROPELLER-DWI will more accurately assign patients into appropriate diagnostic&#xD;
           categories than conventional MRI (T1W, T1W post gadolinium, T2W [FSE/FLAIR FSE]) and CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Prospectively identify the added benefit of repeated MRI in the chronic stage in the&#xD;
           evaluation and management of patients with ICH or IVH. We will test the hypotheses that:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Repeat MRI in the chronic stage (at 60 days) will yield a specific ICH etiology&#xD;
                above and beyond early MRI and CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This information will contribute substantially to our understanding of the value of routine&#xD;
      MRI in patients with a spontaneous ICH or IVH both in the acute and in the chronic phase. It&#xD;
      will also allow us to develop practice guidelines for the use of MRI in these patients.&#xD;
