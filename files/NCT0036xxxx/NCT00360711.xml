      This study will examine the experience of moral value conflicts among genetic counselors.&#xD;
      Previous research has shown that value conflicts do exist among genetic counselors, but&#xD;
      little is known about the nature or consequences of these conflicts. This is a sub-study of&#xD;
      the &quot;Manifestations and Consequences of Moral Distress Among Genetic Service Providers: An&#xD;
      Exploratory Study,&quot; which includes genetic counselors, nurses and medical geneticists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genetic counselors are recruited for this value-conflict sub-study from among those&#xD;
      participating in the Moral Distress study. Participants are interviewed in-depth by telephone&#xD;
      about their experiences of moral value conflicts with clients. The interviews cover the&#xD;
      following: situations in which the counselor has disagreed with a client's decision or views&#xD;
      on a moral level; the counselor's thought processes during and after a session in which&#xD;
      conflicts arise; the counselor's feelings and emotions associated with sessions involving a&#xD;
      moral value conflict; the counselor's current and previous work settings; the counselor's&#xD;
      view of his or her role and responsibility in a client's decision; challenging a client's&#xD;
      values or decision; and preparation for value conflicts.&#xD;

      Genetic counselors may be faced with situations in which they disagree on a moral level with&#xD;
      the views or decisions of their clients. These moral value conflicts between counselors and&#xD;
      their clients may have negative emotional consequences for counselors. Little is known about&#xD;
      the range of sources of these conflicts, the approaches counselors take to address them, or&#xD;
      the impact they have on the counselor's life and career. This study seeks to gain insight&#xD;
      into the nature, sources, and consequences of moral value conflicts among genetic counselors&#xD;
      through semi-structured in-depth interviews with approximately 30 genetic counselors.&#xD;
      Interview questions will be nested within interviews for a larger study entitled &quot;Moral&#xD;
      Distress and Suffering of Genetics Professionals&quot;. The discussion will be centered on a&#xD;
      personal experience of moral value conflict that the counselor has had with a client.&#xD;
      Interviews will be transcribed and subjected to thematic analysis. Such analysis will result&#xD;
      in the identification of common themes running through the interviews. An understanding of&#xD;
      value conflicts may allow for future interventions to minimize the negative effects of these&#xD;
      events.&#xD;
