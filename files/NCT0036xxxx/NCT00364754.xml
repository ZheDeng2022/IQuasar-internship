    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, multi-centre, open-label, cross-over pharmacokinetic study designed to&#xD;
      investigate whether the co-administration of a fixed dose of tesmilifene alters the plasma&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of a standard regimen of epirubicin and/or its principle metabolite,&#xD;
      epirubicinol and cyclophosphamide.&#xD;

      This is a Phase I, multi-centre, open-label, cross-over pharmacokinetic study designed to&#xD;
      investigate whether the co-administration of a fixed dose of tesmilifene alters the plasma&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of a standard regimen of epirubicin and/or it's principle metabolite,&#xD;
      epirubicinol and cyclophosphamide. The plasma pharmacokinetics of epirubicin/epirubicinol and&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide when given alone or concurrently with tesmilifene will be examined. Safety&#xD;
      information for the tesmilifene/ epirubicin and cyclophosphamide combination and for&#xD;
      epirubicin and cyclophosphamide alone in this patient population will also be collected.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with documented histological/cytological proof of metastatic and/or recurrent&#xD;
             breast cancer suitable for treatment with epirubicin and cyclophosphamide. Patients&#xD;
             with locally advanced and inoperable lesions are also eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Previous therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If patients have had hormone-responsive disease, randomization is permitted after&#xD;
                  6 weeks off anti-hormonal therapy or 5 half lives (whichever is shorter) unless&#xD;
                  there is evidence of progressive disease in which case patients could be&#xD;
                  randomized earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  No previous exposure to anthracycline/anthracenedione-based chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients may have received non-anthracycline/anthracenedione based adjuvant&#xD;
                  chemotherapy, completed a minimum of 4 weeks prior to randomization. Patients&#xD;
                  must not have had previous chemotherapy for metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Immunotherapy and experimental therapy must stop a minimum of 4 weeks prior to&#xD;
                  randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A minimum of four weeks must have elapsed between the end of prior radiotherapy&#xD;
                  and randomization. Exceptions will be made, however, for palliative radiotherapy&#xD;
                  which involves no more than 30% of bone marrow.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. ECOG status of 0, 1 or 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Female, aged 18 to 55 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Life expectancy of at least 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients must be willing and able to follow instructions and make all required study&#xD;
             visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients must be willing and able to give written consent to participate in this&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Disease free interval less than or equal to 36 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Normal organ and marrow function&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to randomization and must&#xD;
             be on a medically recognized form of birth control that is approved by the&#xD;
             investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Negative blood tests for HIV and Hepatitis B and C within 4 weeks prior to&#xD;
             randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Previous malignancies, excluding curatively treated basal or squamous cell carcinoma&#xD;
             of the skin or in-situ cervical cancer or any other cancer treated more than five&#xD;
             years prior to study entry and presumed cured.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Known brain or meningeal metastases&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Use of chemotherapeutic agents for any malignancy within 4 weeks prior to study entry&#xD;
             or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more&#xD;
             than 4 weeks earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Treatment with any other investigational drug within the preceding four weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Pregnant and breast-feeding females.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. History of seizure disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;

             months, uncontrolled arterial hypertension, unstable angina, cardiomyopathy or&#xD;
             arterial or ventricular clinically significant arrhythmias even if medically&#xD;
             controlled.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Clinically significant cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, endocrine, hepatic,&#xD;
             respiratory, neurologic, psychiatric, immunologic, gastrointestinal, haematologic,&#xD;
             metabolic or any other condition or laboratory abnormality that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             Investigator or Medical Director of YM BioSciences Inc., makes the patient unsuitable&#xD;
             for participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Known allergy or hypersensitivity to test article ingredients.&#xD;
&#xD;

             Vioxx® ) who can not comply with guidelines or concomitant therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Patients on H1 antagonists as detailed in the protocol who can not comply with&#xD;
             guidelines or concomitant therapy&#xD;
