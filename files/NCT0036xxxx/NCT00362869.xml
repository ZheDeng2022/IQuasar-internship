  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) is a bacterium that can cause diarrhea. The purposes of this&#xD;
      study are to: determine how much EAEC is needed to cause diarrhea in a healthy person,&#xD;
      determine if a genetic factor is important in causing diarrhea, and to see how the body's&#xD;
      defenses control EAEC. Participants include 25 healthy adults, ages 18-40. Volunteers will be&#xD;
      assigned to 1 of 4 dose levels in groups of 5 volunteers each. One volunteer in each group&#xD;
      will receive a sodium bicarbonate placebo solution. Volunteers will be admitted to the&#xD;
      University Clinical Research Unit for up to 8 days. Volunteers will receive therapy with&#xD;
      levofloxacin to treat the infection either once they develop diarrhea or at Day 5 if they&#xD;
      remain asymptomatic. Study procedures will include saliva, blood, and fecal sample&#xD;
      collection. An optional study procedure will include an intestinal biopsy. Participants will&#xD;
      be involved in study related procedures for up to 223 days.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) causes diarrhea in travelers from industrialized&#xD;
      nations to developing countries, children of developing countries, and patients with HIV.&#xD;
      Although infection responds to antibiotic therapy, increasing antibiotic resistance and the&#xD;
      widespread nature of the infection limit the utility of antibiotics. The development of an&#xD;
      EAEC-specific vaccine would be useful in the prevention of travel-associated EAEC diarrhea&#xD;
      and in the decrease of EAEC-associated mortality in young children in the US and of&#xD;
      developing countries. The first objective of the study is to perform a dose-escalation study&#xD;
      of EAEC 042 infectivity in healthy adult volunteers who are high producers of IL-8 and&#xD;
      seronegative to EAEC. The study will identify the dose of EAEC 042 needed for future studies&#xD;
      on EAEC 042 such as phase I-II EAEC vaccine studies. The second objective of the study is to&#xD;
      identify the humoral, secretory, and cellular immune response to EAEC 042 specific antigens&#xD;
      that are associated with EAEC infection. Study participants will include 25 healthy&#xD;
      volunteers, ages 18-40, from the greater Houston area. Study participants will be assigned to&#xD;
      1 of 4 possible dose levels in groups of 5 volunteers each. Each study group will consist of&#xD;
      4 volunteers receiving EAEC and 1 volunteer receiving a sodium bicarbonate placebo solution.&#xD;
      Safety data and results will be reviewed by the safety monitoring committee before beginning&#xD;
      the next highest dose group. If a dose results in at least 3 of the 4 infected volunteers of&#xD;
      a given group, the next highest dose will not be administered. Instead, the concentration&#xD;
      will be repeated for validation of the dose. Healthy volunteers will be screened as&#xD;
      outpatients for the presence of the -251 AA SNP genotype in the IL-8 gene promoter. Once a&#xD;
      volunteer has been screened and determined to be eligible to participate in the study, the&#xD;
      volunteer will sign a consent form and be admitted at the University Clinical Research Unit.&#xD;
      The volunteer will ingest a determined concentration of EAEC 042 or placebo and be observed&#xD;
      for symptoms of infection. All volunteers will receive therapy with levofloxacin to eradicate&#xD;
      the infection either once they develop diarrhea or at Day 5 if they remain asymptomatic.&#xD;
      Volunteers will be discharged from the hospital on Day 7+/-1. Saliva, blood, and feces will&#xD;
      be collected for secretory, humoral, and cellular immune responses to EAEC. An optional&#xD;
      procedure will consist of obtaining jejunal and colonic biopsies prior to challenge (Day&#xD;
      -13±2) and Days 4±1 and 24±3 post challenge. Volunteer participation in endoscopy studies&#xD;
      will be optional and will not be a requirement for the rest of the study. The primary&#xD;
      endpoints of the study include: diarrheal illness after exposure to EAEC, shedding of EAEC&#xD;
      after exposure, and IgG and secretory IgA (slgA) seroconversion to EAEC dispersin. The&#xD;
      secondary endpoints of the study include: increase in fecal markers of intestinal&#xD;
      inflammation including cytokines and lactoferrin and description of the jejunal and colonic&#xD;
      immune response to EAEC infection.&#xD;
