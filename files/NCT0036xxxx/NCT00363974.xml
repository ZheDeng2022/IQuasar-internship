  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the drug, called AEG35156, can be safely given&#xD;
      to AML patients and whether it effectively reduces levels of a protein (XIAP) to increase the&#xD;
      sensitivity of cancer cells to chemotherapy (ara-C and idarubicin) in patients with&#xD;
      refractory or relapsed AML.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I/II, single-arm, open-label, study to establish the recommended dose and&#xD;
      activity of AEG35156 administered as a daily x3 two-hour infusion prior to reinduction&#xD;
      chemotherapy with idarubicin and ara-C followed by weekly two-hour AEG35156 infusions.&#xD;
      Subjects eligible for study entry must have confirmed diagnosis of AML in first relapse after&#xD;
      an initial CR that lasted less than 6 months or primary refractory AML. Fixed dose of&#xD;
      idarubicin and ara-C will be given, plus one of eight doses of AEG35156: 12, 24, 48, 75, 110,&#xD;
      165, 250 and 350mg/m2. A maximum of 54 patients will be treated in cohorts of size 3,&#xD;
      starting at 12mg/m2, and not skipping any untried dose level when escalating. Following dose&#xD;
      escalation, approximately 20 patients will be treated at the best acceptable dose as&#xD;
      determined by the method of Thall and Cook (2004).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with relapsed or refractory AML, except those with APL (acute promyelocytic&#xD;
             leukemia), that are about to receive their initial treatment for first relapse after&#xD;
             an initial CR that lasted less than 6 months or for primary refractory AML that have&#xD;
             an expected complete response rate ≤20%. The initial diagnosis of AML has to be based&#xD;
             on the presence of &gt; 10% blasts in marrow or blood, and the diagnosis of&#xD;
             relapsed/refractory AML based on the presence of either &gt; 10% blasts in marrow or&#xD;
             blood or 5-10% blasts in either site together with cytopenia (Hb &lt; 10 g/dL, or&#xD;
             platelets &lt; 100,000 /uL, or neutrophil count &lt; 1000 /uL).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Peripheral AML blast count &lt; 50,000 /uL that is not projected to rise above 50,000 /uL&#xD;
             within 5 days of beginning treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of&#xD;
             ≤2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be &gt;18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;

             months), or surgically or biologically sterile. Females of childbearing potential with&#xD;
             a negative serum pregnancy test 72-96 hours prior to the 1st infusion in the study and&#xD;

             after the last treatment. Adequate methods of contraception should be used by both&#xD;
             male and female subjects.&#xD;
