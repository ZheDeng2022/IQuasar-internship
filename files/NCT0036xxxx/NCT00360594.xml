    <textblock>
      Acamprosate is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of&#xD;
      alcoholism. The purpose of this study is to see if initiating acamprosate early in alcohol&#xD;
      detoxification instead of waiting until detoxification has been completed effects the course&#xD;
      of detoxification, adverse events during detoxification, drop out rate during the&#xD;
      rehabilitative treatment phase, or overall efficacy of acamprosate for those with alcohol&#xD;
      dependence who plan to receive at least two months of rehabilitative pharmacotherapy with&#xD;
      acamprosate.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria for Post-Detoxification Rehabilitative Treatment Phase (RP/Phase 2) with&#xD;
        Open-Label Acamprosate&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Has taken at least 5 days of acamprosate or placebo directly prior to initiating&#xD;
             open-label acamprosate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Successfully completed, within a 14-day period, outpatient detoxification. Successful&#xD;
             completion of detoxification is defined as having a score of 1 or lower on the&#xD;
             Clinical Institutes Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol (CIWA; Shaw et al., 1981), and&#xD;
             has at least 3 consecutive days of abstinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Has reduced medication taken specifically for detoxification (if applicable), i.e.,&#xD;
