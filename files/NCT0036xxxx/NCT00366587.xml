  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cataract is prevalent throughout the world and IOLs are routinely implanted after the&#xD;
      extraction of the cataractous lens. It is the most frequently performed surgery in the United&#xD;
      States with an estimated 2-3 million procedures performed annually. With the aging population&#xD;
      on the rise, as well as the increasing popularity of refractive intraocular lenses, the&#xD;
      number of intraocular surgeries continues to rise. Over the years, the surgical technique has&#xD;
      evolved from intracapsular extraction to modern phacoemulsification. This development has&#xD;
      helped with the evolution of IOLs as well. The IOLs have advanced extensively: different&#xD;
      materials and designs are available, permitting implantation through smaller, sutureless&#xD;
      incisions. Traditional IOLs are of monofocal design providing vision at one distance,&#xD;
      typically far. Patients implanted with traditional monofocal IOLs usually require glasses for&#xD;
      near distance tasks such as reading. The new multifocal IOLs offer the possibility of seeing&#xD;
      well at more than one distance, without glasses or contacts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The AcrySof ReSTOR (Alcon Laboratories) uses apodized diffractive technology - a design that&#xD;
      responds to how wide or small the eye's pupil might be - to provide near, intermediate, and&#xD;
      distance vision. Clinical studies used to support the March 2005 FDA approval showed that 80%&#xD;
      of people who received the lens did not use glasses for any activities after their cataract&#xD;
      surgery; 84% who received the lens in both eyes had distance vision of 20/25 or better, with&#xD;
      near vision of 20/32 or better.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ReZoom (Advanced Medical Optics) is a multifocal refractive zonal IOL that distributes light&#xD;
      over five optical zones to provide near, intermediate, and distance vision. The ReZoom is a&#xD;
      second-generation multifocal and was FDA-approved in March 2005. In a European study of 215&#xD;
      patients, 93% of ReZoom recipients reported never or only occasionally needing glasses. The&#xD;
      combined use of multifocal intraocular lenses is often a solution to best meet the patients'&#xD;
      refractive needs. There has been speculation that the implantation of ReSTOR in one eye and&#xD;
      ReZoom lens in the fellow eye can provide patients a larger range of useful vision in the&#xD;
      near range.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate visual outcome and patient satisfaction after&#xD;
      implantation of a diffractive multifocal IOL (ReSTOR) in one eye and a refractive multifocal&#xD;
      IOL (ReZoom) in the fellow eye after routine phacoemulsification and compare it to a control&#xD;
      group of patients implanted bilaterally with ReSTOR with both eyes targeted for 0 to Â±0.25 D,&#xD;
      and to a group of patients implanted bilaterally with ReSTOR with the non-dominant eye&#xD;
      targeted for +1.00 D and the dominant eye targeted for 0 to +0.25 D.&#xD;
