      Intermittent Preventive Treatment of malaria in infants is a promising strategy to reduce&#xD;
      incidence of clinical malaria in children under the age of 1 year. It is likely to be&#xD;
      implemented as a malaria control strategy in Tanzania using sulfadoxine/pyremethamine SP. SP&#xD;
      is failing as a first line treatment for clinical episodes of malaria and government policy&#xD;
      is driving a change to use Artemesin Combination Therapy (ACT). The main ongoing Kilimanjaro&#xD;
      IPTi study is looking at alternatives to SP for use in IPTi. Currently, as there is no&#xD;
      evidence for the use of other drugs for IPT, SP will be continued for IPT in pregnancy and in&#xD;
      infants. This study proposes to measure the efficacy of SP and chlorproguanil/dapsone (CD),&#xD;
      in symptomatic 6- 59 month old children using standard methodology. These are both study&#xD;
      drugs in the main IPTi study. This will help us to see how the efficacies of SP and CD in&#xD;
      sick children relate to the efficacies for treating asymptomatic children with IPTi. In&#xD;
      addition this proposal aims to test the efficacy of SP given to 2-10 month old asymptomatic&#xD;
      infants (the target group for IPTi). Evidence suggests that asymptomatic malaria infections&#xD;
      with low parasitaemia have a higher cure rate than symptomatic infections with high&#xD;
      parasitaemia even when markers of resistance are highly prevalent. This second study aims to&#xD;
      quantify this difference and will produce evidence to help policy makers know when drugs used&#xD;
      for IPTi should be changed. Both studies will be open label and run concurrently in Hale,&#xD;
      Korogwe district near to the main Kilimanjaro IPTi site in Tanzania.&#xD;

      Introduction and Rational&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is part of a multicentre trial looking into antimalarial resistance within a series of&#xD;
      Intermittent Preventive Treatment of malaria in Infants (IPTi) studies. IPTi is a promising&#xD;
      intervention to reduce malaria in infants in malaria endemic countries. 3 doses of&#xD;
      antimalarial drugs are given in the first year of life to asymptomatic infants at the time of&#xD;
      2nd and 3rd Diptheria, Tetanus and Pertusus immunisation and again at 9 months of age at time&#xD;
      of measles immunisation. In the current Kilimanjaro IPTi study we are comparing 3&#xD;
      antimalarials (Mefloquine MQ, sulfadoxine/pyremethamine SP and chlorproguanil/dapsone CD)&#xD;
      against placebo for IPTi in 2 transmission zones. Two published studies using SP for IPTi&#xD;
      have shown different efficacies for this intervention. The first study (Schellenberg et al&#xD;
      2001) showed a 62% reduction in clinical cases of malaria and the second (Chandramohan et al,&#xD;
      2005) showed only a 25% reduction in clinical cases of malaria. The two sites differ in&#xD;
      several ways, the first was carried out in an area of moderate to low transmission with a&#xD;
      moderate rate of SP resistance in Tanzania and the latter was carried out in an area of&#xD;
      intense but seasonal malaria with a low rate of SP resistance in Ghana. The current IPTi&#xD;
      study is being carried out in a site of high transmission with expected high rates of SP&#xD;
      resistance. Data from a site 100km away indicates SP efficacy to be 55% (Mutabingwa et al,&#xD;
      2001). There is no data on SP or other study drugs at the ongoing study sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition there is evidence (Personal communication Chandramohan 2005) that the outcome&#xD;
      (Adequate Parasite Response (APR)) of asymptomatic parasitaemia in infants is better than&#xD;
      that in symptomatic 6-59 month old children when using SP. For this reason we plan a novel&#xD;
      study examining the efficacy of SP in asymptomatic 2-10 month old infants, the target age&#xD;
      group for IPTi.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this component of the drug resistance study is to understand the&#xD;
      relationship between the efficacy of antimalarial drugs used for IPTi and the long term&#xD;
      effect of IPTi on incidence of clinical malaria. Schellenberg et al (2005). observed a 36%&#xD;
      reduction in the incidence of clinical malaria in the second year of life in the SP IPTi&#xD;
      group compared to the placebo group even though the last course of SP IPTi was given at 9&#xD;
      months of age (Schellenberg et al, 2005). This suggests that SP IPTi in an area with moderate&#xD;
      malaria transmission and moderate levels of resistance to SP (+/-25%) IPTi may enhance the&#xD;
      development of immunity against malaria. In contrast, a study in Ghana in area with very high&#xD;
      and seasonal malaria transmission and very low resistance to SP (&lt;10%) showed a 20% increase&#xD;
      in the incidence of clinical malaria with high parasite density (&gt;5000 parasites/ml) in SP&#xD;
      IPTi group compared to placebo group. The nature of the relationship between drug resistance&#xD;
      and the long term effect of IPTi on malaria remains unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parasite clearance rate depends on the efficacy of antimalarial drug and host immunity. Host&#xD;
      immunity depends on age - immunity in infants is likely to be lower than the immunity in 1-4&#xD;
      year old children. Parasite clearance rate depends on parasite density, multiplicity of&#xD;
      infection, and the type of host response - these factors differ between clinical episodes of&#xD;
      malaria and asymptomatic parasitaemia. The interaction between antimalarial drug and host&#xD;
      response during a clinical episode of malaria is likely to be different from that during&#xD;
      asymptomatic malaria parasitaemia. Although infants with mild illness will not be excluded&#xD;
      from IPTi administration at routine EPI clinics, the majority of infants will be asymptomatic&#xD;
      when they receive IPTi. Thus results of the standard WHO in vivo drug sensitivity studies&#xD;
      conducted in 6-59 month-old symptomatic children are unlikely to be applicable to 2-10 month&#xD;
      old mostly asymptomatic infants receiving IPTi. However, there is no empirical evidence to&#xD;
      support or refute this assertion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to understand the relationship between level of drug resistance and long terms&#xD;
      effects of IPTi, the exact level of drug resistance in the IPTi target infants needs to be&#xD;
      established and related to IPTi efficacy. Thus a modified WHO in vivo drug resistance study&#xD;
      in 2-10 month old asymptomatic infants needs to be conducted as part of the Kilimanjaro IPTi&#xD;
      study and a comparison made with the efficacy of SP estimated from a standard WHO 6-59 month&#xD;
      WHO in vivo efficacy study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      We therefore propose 2 studies that have the following objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Enumerate the drug efficacies of SP and CD in the study area using the standard WHO in&#xD;
           vivo drug efficacy methodology in symptomatic children aged 6-59 months,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Enumerate the efficacy of SP in asymptomatic 2-10 month olds using a modified WHO in&#xD;
           vivo drug efficacy methodology, the target population for IPTi and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determine the difference of efficacy when using SP for the different indications, ie&#xD;
           between its use in symptomatic and asymptomatic children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 1 is a standard in vivo WHO drug efficacy study looking at parasite positive&#xD;
      symptomatic children between the ages of 6 and 59 months treated with SP or CD. They will be&#xD;
      followed up after 1,2 3, 7,14,21 and 28 days. At each visit a blood slide and filter paper&#xD;
      will be collected. Endpoints are day 28 recrudescence rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 2 is a modified in vivo drug efficacy study in the age group directly affected by IPTi,&#xD;
      namely 2-10 months of age. Asymptomatic children will be followed up at days 1, 2, 3,7,14, 21&#xD;
      and 28 only. Endpoint is day 28 recrudescence rate. Blood slide and filter paper will only be&#xD;
      taken on day 7, 14 and 28 unless the child has a fever or has reported fever in the last 48&#xD;
      hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size and study subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Table 1 Study Arm Expected (assumed) rate of adequate parasitological response by day 28&#xD;
      (APR) Acceptable 95% confidence limit (precision) Sample Size needed based on expected APR&#xD;
      and acceptable precision Total sample size (corrected for assumed 10% loss to follow-up and&#xD;
      10% nonadherence) 6-59 month symptomatic children SP 60% +/-6% 292* 330 CD 805 +/-7.5% 131&#xD;
      145&#xD;
&#xD;
      2-10 month asymptomatic children SP 75% +/-7.5% 146* 161&#xD;
&#xD;
      *SP study numbers are calculated to detect a 15% difference of APR by day 28 between&#xD;
      symptomatic 6-59 month old children and asymptomatic 2-10 month old children with 80% power&#xD;
      at the 5% significance level using a ratio of 2 symptomatic cases to 1 asymptomatic case.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children attending a single health dispensary (Hale dispensary, Korogwe District,Tanga&#xD;
      Region, Tanzania) aged between 6-59 months with a fever or history of fever within the&#xD;
      preceding 48 hours will be asked to take part. If they fit the entry criteria (see attached&#xD;
      protocol) and consent, they will be enrolled in the standard WHO in vivo efficacy study.&#xD;
      Asymptomatic children aged between 2 and 10 months attending the MCH clinic for immunisations&#xD;
      and weighing will be invited to take part in the 2-10 month efficacy study and those eligible&#xD;
      for the study and consenting will be enrolled into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Site&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will take place in Hale Dispensary, a government dispensary offering primary care&#xD;
      and MCH services to a population of more than 8,000, with an average of 30 new births a&#xD;
      month. Hale is situated in Korogwe district,Tanga region, northeastern Tanzania and is&#xD;
      lowland with high malaria transmission. It is less than 10 km from the IPTi study site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that first line antimalarial drug policy will change in November 2006 from SP&#xD;
      to lumefantrine/arthemeter. After this date it will not be ethical to continue the 6-59 month&#xD;
      study in symptomatic children. However for the asymptomatic children it will be ethical to&#xD;
      continue as SP use continues in asymptomatic women for IPTp and if adopted as a strategy for&#xD;
      Tanzania, SP will be used for IPTi. Therefore we plan to carry out the SP efficacy in 6-59&#xD;
      month study in symptomatic children as soon as possible and if the national policy changes&#xD;
      before completion of the study we will have to halt it. The 2-10 month old asymptomatic study&#xD;
      will run concurrently until completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the study the second line drug will be lumefantrine/arthemeter for all children should&#xD;
      treatment fail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical safety of subjects is paramount. We will encourage mothers to bring their children&#xD;
      for review during the follow up period when ever the child is sick. We have budgeted for a&#xD;
      transport allowance for the mothers to help them make the journey when necessary. We will&#xD;
      ensure 24 hour access to a member of the study team at all time. This person will be able to&#xD;
      call on medical staff covering all clinical trial activities in Korogwe District Hospital for&#xD;
      advice and possible emergency transfer to the hospital and assessment. An emergency vehicle&#xD;
      is on standby 24 hours a day.&#xD;
