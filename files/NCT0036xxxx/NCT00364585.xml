      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance of the GreenLight™ model 120&#xD;
      delivering higher average power to allow for more flexibility in the working distance of the&#xD;
      delivery device with the same power density to tissue as that of the current GreenLight&#xD;
      model. In addition this study will examine the Laserscope GDD (guided delivery device) that&#xD;
      has been designed exclusively for use with the GreenLight™ model 120.&#xD;

      Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) refers to a medical condition which occurs in aging men&#xD;
      where the prostate gland is enlarged preventing the free flow of urine. This causes symptoms&#xD;
      of frequent urination, constant feeling of urgency to go to the bathroom, and difficulty&#xD;
      passing urine due to the obstruction caused by the enlarged gland. The incidence (number of&#xD;
      new cases) of BPH increases from 40% among males between the ages of 50 and 60 years to 90%&#xD;
      among males older than 80 years of age. Treatment of BPH is currently undergoing intense&#xD;
      scrutiny due to the cost and morbidity (complications and disability due to the procedure)&#xD;
      associated with the &quot;gold standard&quot; treatment, Transurethral Resection of the Prostate&#xD;
      (TURP). The TURP procedure has established its place as a standard of care for BPH due to its&#xD;
      exceptional clinical efficacy and established long-term durability. Despite the clinical&#xD;
      prowess of TURP, there remain significant concerns regarding the relatively high incidence of&#xD;
      postoperative morbidity and the significant economic burden on world healthcare systems.&#xD;
      Laser vaporization prostatectomy, on the other hand, has developed into a relatively new&#xD;
      technological advance that has been utilized with favorable outcomes for more than a decade.&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Subjects with a recent myocardial infarction or coronary artery stent placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects with systemic diseases that cause significant neurogenic lower urinary&#xD;
             dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects who have had major pelvic fractures that involved damage to the external&#xD;
             urinary sphincter.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects who have recently completed definitive radiation therapy for prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects with prostate cancer who are considering brachytherapy (radioactive seed&#xD;
