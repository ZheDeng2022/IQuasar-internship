      Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To confirm the efficacy of intranasal fentanyl titrated to doses 50, 100 or 200 µg for&#xD;
           treatment of breakthrough pain (BTP) in cancer patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To establish long-term safety of treatment with intranasal fentanyl&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To explore the relationship between dose of background opioid treatment and titrated&#xD;
      fentanyl dose&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Has the patient given informed consent according to local requirements before any&#xD;
             trial-related activities? Trial-related activities are any procedure that would not&#xD;
             have been performed during the routine management of the patient&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Is the patient a cancer patient with breakthrough pain?&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Is the patient aged ≥18 years?&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Has the patient received for at least the past month either oral morphine, oxycodone,&#xD;
             hydromorphone or transdermal fentanyl for treatment of background pain?&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Is the current dose of the scheduled background opioid of the patient equivalent to&#xD;
             60-500 mg oral morphine/day or to transdermal fentanyl 25-200 µg/hour? For conversion&#xD;
             table.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Is the background pain generally stable and on average controlled to a mild level&#xD;
             (defined as ≤4 on an 11 point NRS) by the background opioid?&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Is the BTP(s) in general of so severe pain intensity that the patient judges he/she&#xD;
             needs additional analgesics (apart from background pain analgesics) and does it&#xD;
             normally last for more than 15 minutes?&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Does the patient in general while using a stable, fixed-schedule, opioid regimen have&#xD;
             at least three BTP episodes per week but no more than four BTP episodes per day?*&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Has the patient obtained at least partial relief of BTP(s) with his/her usual&#xD;
             immediate-release strong opioid, i.e. oral morphine, oxycodone, hydromorphone or&#xD;
             transmucosal fentanyl?&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Is the patient able to use intranasal drugs?&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Does the patient use adequate contraceptive precaution (contraceptive pill, implant or&#xD;
             injection or intrauterine device) in the trial period?&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Did the patient have a negative pregnancy test at the inclusion in studies FT-016-IM&#xD;
             or FT-017-IM?&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All exclusion criteria must be answered &quot;no&quot; for a patient to participate in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Does the patient have a recent history of substance abuse?&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Is the patient pregnant or nursing during the trial period?&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Has the patient neurological or psychiatric impairment that may compromise data&#xD;
             collection?&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Has the patient severe hepatic impairment? (Investigator's judgement according to&#xD;
             local practice)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Has the patient had any recent therapy, which could potentially alter pain or response&#xD;
             to analgesics to a degree, where the need for background opioid will be less than 60&#xD;
             mg morphine or morphine equivalents/day or less than 25 µg/hour transdermal fentanyl&#xD;
             or the number of BTP episodes will be less than three per week during the trial&#xD;
             period?&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Has the patient had facial radiotherapy?&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Has the patient been treated with MAO inhibitor within the last 14 days?&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Does the patient use Methadone or Buprenorphine?&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Does the patient have an impaired respiratory function to an extent, which may&#xD;
             severely increase the risk of clinically relevant respiratory depression by BTP&#xD;
             fentanyl treatment?&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Does the patient use drugs for intranasal administration?&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Does the patient have nasopharyngeal probe?&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Is the patient known to be hypersensitive to fentanyl or to other opioids or any of&#xD;
             their excipients?&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Has the patient any head injury, primary brain tumour or other pathological&#xD;
             conditions, which could significantly increase the risk of increased intracranial&#xD;
             pressure or impaired consciousness?&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Has the patient concomitant participation in any other trial with an investigational&#xD;
             drug or device apart from cancer treatment and participation in intranasal fentanyl&#xD;
             trials FT-016-IM/ FT-017-IM within 30 days prior to inclusion in this trial?&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Does the patient have pathological conditions of the nasal cavity as contraindication&#xD;
             to intranasal fentanyl?&#xD;
