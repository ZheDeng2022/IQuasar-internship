  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This RCT compares the clinical and non clinical condom failure rate among condom using&#xD;
      heterosexual couples with and without externally applied additional spermicidal lubricant.&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that breakage and slippage rates will be reduced.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A recent retrospective cohort study of 1006 subjects reported a marked reduction in condom&#xD;
      failure amongst users applying additional lubrication. Improving the reliability of condoms&#xD;
      would reduce the incidence of unwanted pregnancies and STI's (and hence health and social&#xD;
      costs). This trial investigates the relative risk reduction amongst couples applying&#xD;
      additional spermicidal lubrication to condoms, other factors associated with condom failure,&#xD;
      the acceptability and side effects of additional spermicide and its cost effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      200 regular condom users will be recruited from family planning clinics and other community&#xD;
      sources. A randomised, controlled investigator blinded, crossover design is being used.&#xD;
      Participants will be reviewed at 3 and 6 months. Couples will be randomised to start either&#xD;
      with latex condoms alone (Durex Extra Safe) or with additional Duragel (nonoxynol-9&#xD;
      contracceptive gel) applied to the outside of the condom prior to initial penetration.&#xD;
      Participants are heterosexual couples using condoms for vaginal non-commercial intercourse in&#xD;
      stable relationships of at least 3 months duration. Those under 18, or unable to provide data&#xD;
      due to communication difficulties will be excluded from the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected by questionnaires for all subjects on their contraceptive and STI&#xD;
      history, key demographic, social and behavioural factors relevant to condom failure risk at&#xD;
      baseline. At crossover and trial end the rate and types of condom failure, side effects and&#xD;
      acceptability of additional spermicide, and health service and subject costs are collected. A&#xD;
      random sample of subjects also participate in a detailed semi-structured interview at the end&#xD;
      of the study, covering their recent experiences of condom failure, and opinions about condoms&#xD;
      in general, including the use of additional spermicide. These qualitative findings will then&#xD;
      be discussed in patient and professional focus groups as a proxy for respondent checking and&#xD;
      data triangulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research will provide valuable, detailed information on factors associated with condom&#xD;
      failure. Confirmation of the previous finding of the protective effects of additional&#xD;
      spermicide would have a potentially major international impact in the fields of family&#xD;
      planning and infectious diseases.&#xD;
