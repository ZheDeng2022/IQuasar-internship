  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Because adherence to postnatal care guidelines across the United States (U.S.) is poor,&#xD;
      newborns and mothers often are placed at undue risk for adverse medical and social outcomes.&#xD;
      This study aims to evaluate an alternative model of care and improve healthcare delivery to&#xD;
      and reduce health disparities for &quot;well&quot; newborns and mothers after hospital discharge by&#xD;
      using single postnatal home nurse visits. The principal investigator has previously shown a&#xD;
      reduction in poor outcomes for infants who receive a home visit after discharge when studied&#xD;
      retrospectively. The proposed research will build on the previous study and prospectively&#xD;
      evaluate the impact of a single home nursing visit on morbidities and health disparities for&#xD;
      newborns and mothers in a randomized, controlled trial involving 1154 mother/infant&#xD;
      breastfeeding dyads. Home visits should guarantee detailed assessment during an at-risk&#xD;
      period of infancy and motherhood, where medical and social problems can be recognized,&#xD;
      anticipated, and/or treated, and can bridge the gap between hospital care and primary care.&#xD;
      The investigators' program, The Nurses for Infants Through Teaching and Assessment after the&#xD;
      NurserY (NITTANY) Initiative, also will consider the cost-effectiveness of home visitation&#xD;
      compared with guidelines-adherent outpatient clinic care.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In the NITTANY Initiative the effectiveness of a single postnatal/postpartum home nurse visit&#xD;
      will be evaluated prospectively and compared with outpatient clinic-based care using a&#xD;
      randomized, controlled study design. We will attempt to reduce morbidity in the&#xD;
      neonatal/postpartum period using a well-timed home visit measured first by a reduction in the&#xD;
      need for additional hospital services (inpatient hospitalization and ED visitation) in the&#xD;
      first 14 days after delivery. While healthcare utilization may not be the most important&#xD;
      health outcome for newborns and mothers from a long-term perspective, the demographic groups&#xD;
      at-risk for these outcomes tend to parallel those at greater long-term risk. Also, in the&#xD;
      short-term these outcomes may be the most costly ones for insurance providers and can be used&#xD;
      in a cost-effectiveness analysis to justify home nurse visits. Readmissions and use of urgent&#xD;
      care also may be the most noticeable outcome for clinicians, which should help to modify&#xD;
      practice patterns and improve compliance with guidelines for healthcare delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over a 3-year period we will prospectively enroll a cohort of 1154 &quot;well&quot; singleton newborns&#xD;
      and their mothers admitted to the hospital nursery that are most at-risk for readmission&#xD;
      based on demographic features. Previous data have indicated those at greatest risk for&#xD;
      adverse health outcomes are infants born to breastfeeding mothers and those with less&#xD;
      parenting experience. Minorities and Medicaid recipients are more likely to suffer from&#xD;
      healthcare disparities. For mothers, morbidities may occur in all socioeconomic groups, but&#xD;
      those undergoing operative delivery or instrument assisted vaginal deliveries tend to suffer&#xD;
      greater morbidity. In this study, patients will be randomized to receive usual, guideline&#xD;
      adherent, post-discharge care with or without a home nurse visit 1-2 days after nursery&#xD;
      discharge. For each newborn and mother, information from the pregnancy, obstetrical record,&#xD;
      and the nursery course will be collected. Data also will be recorded regarding continuity of&#xD;
      care during the perinatal period, hospital readmissions, ED visits, compliance with and&#xD;
      extent of outpatient care, satisfaction with and convenience of care, and costs of&#xD;
      healthcare. Method of infant feeding, maternal confidence, maternal depression and anxiety,&#xD;
      and satisfaction with care will also be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To accomplish the objectives of this project, we will focus on the following 3 specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC AIM 1. Establish that single home nursing visits improve healthcare delivery to and&#xD;
      reduce adverse health outcomes for breastfeeding newborns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This model of home visitation will be shown to reduce postnatal morbidities, improve&#xD;
      compliance with post-discharge guidelines, and reduce disparities in health outcomes for&#xD;
      those enrolled in a prospective trial based on data presented under Preliminary Studies&#xD;
      conducted by the PI. A randomized, controlled trial will be conducted over a period of 36&#xD;
      months to demonstrate that infants that receive a single home visit have a reduced need for&#xD;
      subsequent hospital-based or non-scheduled urgent care services. Secondary outcomes of&#xD;
      importance will include compliance with follow-up guidelines and breastfeeding rates that&#xD;
      also are expected to improve in those receiving a home visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC AIM 2. Establish that single home nursing visits improve healthcare delivery to and&#xD;
      reduce adverse outcomes for mothers who are breastfeeding their newborns. Maternal&#xD;
      readmission, emergency department utilization, and need for non-scheduled urgent care&#xD;
      services will be reduced in the group of women receiving a single, postpartum home visit&#xD;
      compared with standard care. Additionally, parenting sense of competence, satisfaction with&#xD;
      postpartum healthcare, level of perceived social support, and the incidence of postpartum&#xD;
      depression and anxiety will be improved among women randomized to receive a home nursing&#xD;
      visit during the stressful and emotional period following childbirth compared with those&#xD;
      randomized to not receive a home visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC AIM 3. Prospectively evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a single postnatal home&#xD;
      nursing visit after maternity/nursery hospital discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from the trial will be used to perform a stochastic cost-effectiveness analysis to&#xD;
      demonstrate prospectively that a single home nursing visit is cost-effective based upon the&#xD;
      reduction of the need for subsequent hospital or non-scheduled urgent care based services&#xD;
      (inpatient, emergency department, and outpatient) for newborns and mothers in the first 14&#xD;
      postnatal/postpartum days. Again based on the previous retrospective study conducted by the&#xD;
      PI, home visits are expected to be a cost-effective intervention. Other factors including&#xD;
      maternal health outcomes, breastfeeding, and long-term health and social outcomes will be&#xD;
      assessed in terms of their relationship with cost.&#xD;
