  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of CG5503 base Immediate Release(IR) 50&#xD;
      mg or 100 mg taken every 4 to 6 hours as needed over the long-term exposure of 90 days in&#xD;
      patients who have chronic pain.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      CG5503 is a centrally active pain-relieving drug being investigated for the treatment of&#xD;
      acute and chronic pain. This study is designed to assess the safety of CG5503 Immediate&#xD;
      Release (IR) in men and women who are 18 years of age or older and who have had chronic (for&#xD;
      at least 3 months) low-back pain or chronic pain from osteoarthritis of the hip or knee, and&#xD;
      who require daily analgesic medication. In this double blind study (neither patients nor&#xD;
      investigators will know what treatment is given), patients will be randomly (patients are&#xD;
      assigned different treatments based on chance) assigned to receive either CG5503 base IR or&#xD;
      oxycodone IR to begin a 90 day treatment during which each patient will return to the medical&#xD;
      facility every 2 weeks. For the CG5503 IR group, patients will take 50 or 100 mg orally every&#xD;
      4 to 6 hours as needed to a maximum dose of 600 mg per day. Oxycodone IR patients will take&#xD;
      10 or 15 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours as needed to a maximum dose of 90 mg per day. Patients&#xD;
      may continue taking their regular, stable, non-opioid medication throughout the study. The&#xD;
      effectiveness of study treatment (CG5503 base IR or oxycodone) will be assessed with 11-Point&#xD;
      Numerical Rating Scale and Patient Global Impression of Change. Using these scales, patients&#xD;
      will indicate their pain intensity level and overall status of their well-being. Opioid&#xD;
      withdrawal symptoms of CG5503 IR dose of 50 or 100 mg will be assessed with clinical opioid&#xD;
      withdrawal scale [Subjective Opiate Withdrawal Scale (SOWS) and Clinical Opiate Withdrawal&#xD;
      Scale (COWS)] at the end of treatment. Using these scales, patients will indicate the&#xD;
      physical components of drug withdrawal and the severity of symptoms associated with rapid&#xD;
      withdrawal. Safety will be assessed using physical examination, monitoring of adverse events,&#xD;
      clinical and laboratory measures, and 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG) results. Constipation,&#xD;
      vomiting, and sleep assessments will be performed. No formal hypothesis testing will be done&#xD;
      in this study. For the CG5503 IR group, patients will take a flexible dose of 50 or 100 mg&#xD;
      orally every 4 to 6 hours as needed to a maximum dose of 600 mg per day for 90 days.&#xD;
      Oxycodone IR patients will take a flexible dose of 10 or 15 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours as&#xD;
      needed to a maximum dose of 90 mg per day for 90 days.&#xD;
