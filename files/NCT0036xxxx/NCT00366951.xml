  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our purpose was to compare the efficacy and safety of Foley catheter with oxytocin and&#xD;
      extraamniotic saline infusion with oxytocin for induction of labor requiring cervical&#xD;
      ripening.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Induction of labor is indicated when the benefit to either the mother or fetus outweighs that&#xD;
      of continuing the pregnancy. Labor induction in the presence of an unripened cervix is&#xD;
      associated with prolonged labor, chorioamnionitis, and cesarean delivery. Numerous mechanical&#xD;
      and pharmacological methods have been used for cervical ripening. There are limited numbers&#xD;
      of rigorous studies comparing the efficacy of the various methods. One of the most common&#xD;
      mechanical methods for cervical ripening is placement of a Foley catheter with a 30 cc&#xD;
      balloon inside the cervix, with or without the use of oxytocin. The Foley balloon will&#xD;
      disrupt the amniotic membrane surface and cause the release of prostaglandin, a natural&#xD;
      chemical from the cervix, to facilitate the ripening process. Oxytocin will be used&#xD;
      concurrently as the induction agent. Recently, a modification of this method, extraamniotic&#xD;
      saline infusion (EASI) has become more popular. The EASI method involves similar procedure&#xD;
      including the placement of Foley catheter inside the cervix; in addition, saline solution&#xD;
      will be infused through the catheter. This additional step is thought to further facilitate&#xD;
      the disruption of amniotic membrane surface. Both methods are safe and become the standard&#xD;
      treatment for cervical ripening. However, there are no published trials so far comparing the&#xD;
      two methods. The objective of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of Foley&#xD;
      catheter with oxytocin and EASI with oxytocin for induction of labor requiring cervical&#xD;
      ripening. The study is designed to be a single masked randomized trial.&#xD;
