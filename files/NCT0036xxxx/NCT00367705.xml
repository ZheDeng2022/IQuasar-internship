  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Crohn's disease (CD) in childhood is a chronic relapsing and remitting condition that has a&#xD;
      significant impact on growth and development. The disease is characterized by an increased&#xD;
      and unregulated immune response. The main therapy over the last 30 years has been&#xD;
      corticosteroids leading to remission in 50-80% of patients within 2-4 weeks. However, the use&#xD;
      of steroids in children is limited by side-effects including acne, moon-face, hirsutism,&#xD;
      hypertension, metabolic disturbances and above all reduced growth. Hence, pediatricians are&#xD;
      very interested to find alternative therapies. Therapeutic manipulation of gut flora with&#xD;
      probiotics promises to be a useful strategy for several disorders including inflammation of&#xD;
      the gut. The efficacy of the highly concentrated probiotic VSL#3 has been documented in&#xD;
      maintenance and prophylaxis treatment of pouchitis in double blind, placebo controlled&#xD;
      studies in adults. The aim of this study is to compare probiotic therapy with VSL#3 versus&#xD;
      placebo in maintenance therapy of children with mild to moderate CD, treated with either&#xD;
      5-ASA, corticosteroids (local or budesonide), imuran/6 mercaptopurine (MP), as long as no&#xD;
      change in medication dosage has been made in the previous 12 weeks (for imuran/6MP) or 4&#xD;
      weeks (for corticosteroids).&#xD;

      The aim of this study is to compare probiotic therapy with VSL#3 versus placebo in&#xD;
      maintenance therapy of children with mild to moderate CD, treated with either 5-ASA,&#xD;
      corticosteroids (local or budesonide), imuran/6MP, as long as no change in medication dosage&#xD;
      has been made in the previous 12 weeks (for imuran/6MP) or 4 weeks (for corticosteroids). The&#xD;
      primary goal will be to compare their ability to maintain remission and to decrease disease&#xD;
      activity in each of the two study groups. Data will be collected during this 16 week period&#xD;
      regarding the safety and tolerability of VSL#3, as well as data of changes in stool&#xD;
      composition of microflora upon treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The follow up will be continued for up to 6 months with a monthly telephone questionnaire and&#xD;
      a clinical visit at 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be a multinational, double-blind, randomized controlled study (Munich, Paris,&#xD;
      Rotterdam, Porto, Brussels, London, Warsaw, Chicago, Toronto, Boston, New York, Baltimore,&#xD;
      Cleveland, Karachi and Jerusalem).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include 300 children and will last for at least 16 weeks. These children will&#xD;
      receive either 1-2 packet according to their weight; each sachet containing 900 billion&#xD;
      bacteria/day of VSL#3 or an identical placebo, for 16 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients participating in this study will continue regular medications throughout the&#xD;
      study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) patients will be assessed&#xD;
      clinically at regular intervals and will have stool cultured (including lactobacillus,&#xD;
      bifidobacteria and Strep salivarius) as well as a stool calprotectin before and after&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
