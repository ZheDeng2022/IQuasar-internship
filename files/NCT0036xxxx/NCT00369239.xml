  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to see how well patients in an early phase of their&#xD;
      illness respond to treatment and whether this depends on how well they functioned socially,&#xD;
      academically and vocationally before becoming ill. The study also examines whether patients&#xD;
      with more insight into their illness have better outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intervention with antipsychotic medications during the early stages of schizophrenia may&#xD;
      result in a better outcome for patients, with a higher number of patients achieving full&#xD;
      remission, a shorter time to remission and decreased risk of relapse. In addition, there is&#xD;
      evidence to suggest that a critical window of opportunity exists in the early period of&#xD;
      syndromal differentiation, when pharmacological intervention and intensive engagement of the&#xD;
      patient may impact favourably on symptoms in the longer term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long-acting injectable formulation of risperidone has shown improvements in measures of&#xD;
      disease severity over the oral formulation, and demonstrated an improved safety and&#xD;
      tolerability profile because of its lower peak-trough levels. A recent study has demonstrated&#xD;
      that patients in the early phase of their illness (0-3 years) benefit from treatment with&#xD;
      RLAI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although premorbid functioning is accepted to be a predictor of outcome and to affect&#xD;
      treatment adherence, prospective clinical data are scarce. RLAI addresses the problem of&#xD;
      adherence by eliminating the need for daily medication intake. In this study we investigate&#xD;
      whether patients with good premorbid functioning respond better to treatment with RLAI&#xD;
      compared to patients with poor premorbid functioning. Moreover, patients with schizophrenia&#xD;
      often fail to acknowledge their illness and need for treatment - so-called 'lack of insight'.&#xD;
      Previous studies investigating the relationship between acute psychopathology and insight&#xD;
      have produced conflicting results. Multiple administrations of a structured measure of&#xD;
      insight (SAI-E) and symptom measures will provide here a means to evaluate whether insight is&#xD;
      correlated with clinical change, whether insight changes over time and whether changes in&#xD;
      insight are related to changes in psychopathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A physical examination will be performed, including heart rate, blood pressure, and weight.&#xD;
      Interviews and assessments will be made to complete standard rating scales (Positive and&#xD;
      Negative Symptom Score (PANSS), Scale for Assessment of Insight-Expanded version (SAI-E),&#xD;
      Clinical Global Impression (CGI), Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF), and Extrapyramidal&#xD;
      Symptom Rating Scale (ESRS)). The Short-Form-36 questionnaire (SF-36) will be completed by&#xD;
      the patient. Any health problems and medicines of the patient will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypothesis, that patients with &quot;Stable-good&quot; premorbid functioning will have&#xD;
      better outcomes than those with &quot;Stable-poor&quot; premorbid functioning will be examined by&#xD;
      dividing patients into a &quot;Stable-good&quot; and &quot;Stable-poor&quot; premorbid functioning groups based&#xD;
      on their total scores on the Premorbid Adjustment Scale (PAS). Statistically significant&#xD;
      differences between the &quot;Stable-good&quot; vs. &quot;Stable-poor&quot; pre-morbid groups on the combined&#xD;
      change measure at the 5% level will be interpreted as supporting the hypothesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Association of insight and outcomes will be examined using Scale for Assessment of&#xD;
      Insight-Expanded version (SAI-E )and insight item (G 12) from Positive and Negative Symptom&#xD;
      Score (PANSS). Effectiveness [Clinical Global Impression (CGI-S/C), PANSS, retention rate),&#xD;
      functioning [Short-Form-36 questionnaire (SF-36, rehospitalisation rates)] and safety and&#xD;
      tolerability will be assessed. The observation period is 6 months. RLAI is given as&#xD;
      intramuscular injections every 2 weeks. The starting dose of RLAI will be in accordance with&#xD;
      the product label (usually 25 mg). If necessary, the dosage of the injection may be increased&#xD;
      gradually. Treatment duration is 26 weeks. To ensure continued antipsychotic coverage until&#xD;
      the main release of risperidone from the microspheres, previous antipsychotic therapy will be&#xD;
      continued concomitantly during the first three weeks of the study.&#xD;
