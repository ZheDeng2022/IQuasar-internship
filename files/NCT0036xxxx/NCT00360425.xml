      This trial will be conducted in order to provide an evaluation of the potential of&#xD;
      ferumoxytol to cause cardiac arrhythmia in accordance with the International Conference on&#xD;
      Harmonization (ICH) E14 guidance. The purpose of this trial is to define the effects of&#xD;
      ferumoxytol on electrocardiogram (ECG) data. Pharmacokinetics will also be evaluated at&#xD;
      multiple time points as specified. Subject safety will be monitored throughout the study.&#xD;
