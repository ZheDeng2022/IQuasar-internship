  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of treatment with epoetin alfa&#xD;
      (recombinant human erythropoietin) or placebo on anemia related quality-of-life and anemia in&#xD;
      hormone-refractory (not responding to hormone therapy) prostate cancer patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Anemia is a common problem experienced by patients with malignancy. Although cancer treatment&#xD;
      such as systemic chemotherapy is an obvious cause, many cancer patients are anemic at&#xD;
      presentation. Estimates in prostate cancer patients suggest that nearly 40% present with&#xD;
      hemoglobin levels less than 120 g/L. The most common clinical manifestation of anemia is&#xD;
      fatigue, although vertigo, loss of appetite, poor concentration and dyspnea (shortness of&#xD;
      breath) can also occur. Anemia often leads to impairment of physical capacity, lowers&#xD;
      patients' subjective sense of well-being, and diminishes their overall quality-of-life (QoL).&#xD;
      The use of recombinant erythropoietin for patients with chronic anemia of end stage renal&#xD;
      disease, acquired immune deficiency syndrome, or anemia of chronic disease in the setting of&#xD;
      malignancy (cancer) is well established to provide benefit in reducing transfusion&#xD;
      requirements. There exists a number of published data on QoL in cancer patients. Abels et al.&#xD;
      published in 1991 initial results of clinical reports that specifically reported on QoL&#xD;
      outcomes. The study actually consisted of a series of three concurrent randomized, double&#xD;
      blind, placebo controlled trials conducted on groups of patients with a variety of underlying&#xD;
      malignancies. The three studies included 124 patients not previously treated with systemic&#xD;
      therapy, 132 patients treated systemically with cisplatinum containing chemotherapy regimens&#xD;
      and 157 patients treated with non-cisplatinum containing regimens respectively. All patients&#xD;
      had pre-treatment hemoglobins of less than 105 g/L or hematocrits (percentage of red blood&#xD;
      cells in blood) of less than 32%. In each trial, patients randomized to receive recombinant&#xD;
      erythropoietin had significantly greater increases in hematocrit than placebo patients. QoL&#xD;
      parameters (as measured on a visual analog scale) were significantly improved in patients&#xD;
      receiving erythropoietin who demonstrated an increase in hematocrit throughout the three&#xD;
      studies. Overall QoL improved significantly over baseline, although individual studies only&#xD;
      demonstrated a trend towards improvement. Littlewood et al. published in 2001 the results of&#xD;
      a double-blind, placebo controlled multi-center study of 375 cancer patients receiving&#xD;
      non-platinum containing chemotherapy. A baseline hemoglobin of less than or equal to 105 g/L,&#xD;
      or a drop of 20 g/L with chemotherapy was required for eligibility. Patients were randomized&#xD;
      1:2 to either placebo or epoetin alfa, for up to 4 weeks following chemotherapy. Active&#xD;
      treatment demonstrated significant effectiveness in increasing hemoglobin levels and reducing&#xD;
      transfusion requirements. Significant improvement in all primary cancer- and anemia-specific&#xD;
      QoL domains favoured epoetin alfa. Although clinical evidence suggests benefit beyond reduced&#xD;
      transfusion requirements, many studies looking at impact on QoL have been uncontrolled by&#xD;
      design, with variable quality and collection of QoL data. Since they have also involved&#xD;
      patients with a myriad of primary malignancies, and previous therapies, the translation of&#xD;
      results to site and situation specific clinical practice has been difficult. As&#xD;
      erythropoiesis is a complex process that depends on inhibiting or stimulating cytokines,&#xD;
      which may be regulated differently among various neoplastic diseases (i.e. different tumour&#xD;
      types), studies in more homogenous groups of patients were deemed necessary to evaluate&#xD;
      impact on QoL. Prostate cancer is the most common serious cancer in men. Despite advances in&#xD;
      screening and treatment, progression to the incurable metastatic phase of the disease remains&#xD;
      common. Androgen ablation therapy using surgery or drugs remains the standard of treatment,&#xD;
      but inevitably, androgen resistance develops. Hormone refractory prostate cancer represents a&#xD;
      spectrum of disease ranging from asymptomatic patients with only biochemical evidence of&#xD;
      androgen resistance to end-stage disease characterized by extensive bone metastases, pain,&#xD;
      wasting, reduced QoL, and a median survival of less than one year. Treatment of hormone&#xD;
      refractory prostate cancer does not prolong survival, but may improve symptoms and QoL.&#xD;
      Anemia is common in this group of patients, with hemoglobin levels of less than 120 g/L often&#xD;
      seen (in up to 40% patients). Patients are also genrally older, often have co-morbid&#xD;
      conditions, and transfusions for palliation are frequently given. A randomized,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled study evaluating an intervention with epoetin alfa that could&#xD;
      significantly improve QoL was thus carried out in hormone refractory prostate cancer&#xD;
      patients. It was deemed that such an intervention, if successful, could have the potential to&#xD;
      change current clinical practice. Moreover, improved QoL, in response to increased Hb levels,&#xD;
      could also lead to a reduction in hospital admissions and to fewer transfusions in this&#xD;
      patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were to receive either 40,000 IU epoetin alfa weekly or matching placebo&#xD;
      subcutaneously for 16 weeks.&#xD;
