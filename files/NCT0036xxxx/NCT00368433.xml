      This study will investigate how the sensitivity to touch and smell in patients with Tourette&#xD;
      syndrome (TS) may differ from that of people without TS. TS is a neurological disorder that&#xD;
      causes people to have uncontrolled movements called &quot;tics.&quot; A tic can also be vocal, like a&#xD;
      cough or bark or string of bad words. The tic is preceded by a &quot;premonitory urge&quot; that may&#xD;
      feel like an itch or pressure that builds until the tic occurs. To some patients, the tic&#xD;
      feels like a response to an involuntary sensation. In patients with TS, sensory information&#xD;
      may be processed differently than it is in people without TS. This study will compare how&#xD;
      strong a sensation feels in TS patients and healthy volunteers. It will also look for muscle&#xD;
      activity that may be responsible for the feelings in the area of the tic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy normal volunteers and people with Tourette syndrome, 18 to 65 years of age, may be&#xD;
      eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history and brief physical&#xD;
      and neurological examinations. TS patients complete a questionnaire about their tics and are&#xD;
      interviewed by a psychiatrist. Women who can become pregnant will have a urine pregnancy test&#xD;
      prior to any other procedures. Pregnant women cannot participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants undergo sensory testing for touch and smell. They are asked to distinguish&#xD;
      between a scented and scentless object and rate how strongly they feel the scent. Later, with&#xD;
      their eyes closed, they are asked to tell whether or not they are being touched, and to rate&#xD;
      how intensely they felt the touch.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the sensory testing, TS patients, but not normal volunteers, undergo&#xD;
      electromyography (EMG), a test that measures the electrical activity of muscles. For surface&#xD;
      EMG, small metal disks called electrodes are filled with a conductive gel and taped to the&#xD;
      skin. Wire EMG involves inserting a wire into a muscle using a needle. All patients have&#xD;
      surface EMG and those who consent to it will also have wire EMG.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will explore sensory phenomena associated with Tourette syndrome (TS). The first&#xD;
      part will evaluate threshold levels versus perceived intensity of tactile and olfactory&#xD;
      stimuli in areas reported to be hypersensitive in TS patients. The second part will use&#xD;
      electromyography (EMG) to seek correlation between muscle activity and the perceived&#xD;
      intensity of &quot;urge&quot; in focal areas of premonitory sensations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty-six patients and 22 control subjects will be studied. Subjects can be of any race,&#xD;
      gender, handedness, or age from 18 to 65 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine olfactory and tactile threshold, n-butanol and Von Frey hairs will be presented&#xD;
      in forced-choice modified method of limits paradigms. Perceived intensity will be examined&#xD;
      using a generalized labeled magnitude scale (gLMS), whose word values are placed on a ruler&#xD;
      for numerical reporting. Randomly arranged series of 7 stimuli for olfaction and touch will&#xD;
      be presented in 4 sets, and subjects will report a number on the gLMS that corresponds to the&#xD;
      intensity of each sensation. Both threshold and intensity will be measured in the peroneal&#xD;
      nerve territory in all subjects, and at one other variable place, which will be matched 1:1&#xD;
      between patients and controls. The variable spot will consist of a patient's sensory tic&#xD;
      site. Next, EMG activity will be measured from up to 8 muscles in the area of a sensory tic.&#xD;
      Patients will report when a sensory tic is occurring, and will be asked to resist the motor&#xD;
      tic for at least 12 seconds from that point. Total EMG activity will be measured in muscles&#xD;
      surrounding the sensation at 1, 4, and 7 seconds before and after the tic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME MEASURES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures include the sensory threshold values for olfaction and touch and the&#xD;
      reported intensity values. The outcome measures of the EMG study include the power of total&#xD;
      EMG activity at time points before and after a tic.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Healthy Volunteers ages 18 to 65 who have who have given their consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will be ages 18 to 65 and have clinically documented Tourette's syndrome or&#xD;
        chronic motor tic disorder as defined by DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2000)&#xD;
        and evaluation of tic severity using the Yale Tic Scale (YGTS). This criterion will be&#xD;
        established by preliminary screening in the NINDS Movement Disorders Outpatient Clinic.&#xD;
        Structure Clinical Interview for (DSMIV SCID) will be administered to all patients to&#xD;
        ensure that strict DSM-IV criteria for Tourette Syndrome have been met and to assess for&#xD;
        possible comorbid psychiatric disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with at least moderate premonitory urge, as evaluated with the PUTS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;

        prior to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects with acute or chronic upper respiratory illness, nasal allergies, or subjects&#xD;

        steroids, vasoconstrictor nasal sprays, or normal saline sprays.&#xD;
