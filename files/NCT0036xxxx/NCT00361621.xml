  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to begin to collect information and try to learn whether or&#xD;
      not VELCADE, when added to standard chemotherapy with CHOP/Rituxan, works in treating&#xD;
      patients mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma. Recent research has shown that this type of&#xD;
      lymphoma shares features with Hodgkin's lymphoma, including the importance of a particular&#xD;
      pathway in the tumor cells called the NF-kB pathway. VELCADE works in part by blocking this&#xD;
      pathway.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  This is a single arm phase 2 study of CHOP/Rituxan plus VELCADE followed by involved&#xD;
           field radiotherapy designed to evaluate the complete response to chemotherapy as&#xD;
           determined by PET scan following six cycles of therapy. One cycle equals 21 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For each cycle, on Day 1, the patient will receive VELCADE intravenously, followed by&#xD;
           rituxan, and then followed by CHOP chemotherapy. Before receiving these drugs, the&#xD;
           patient will be given standard medications (Tylenol, Benadryl) to help minimize side&#xD;
           effects. They will also continue to take prednisone by mouth on days 2, 3, 4, and 5. On&#xD;
           Day 4, the patient will receive another dose of VELCADE.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Before the beginning of every cycle of study treatment, the following will be performed:&#xD;
           Medical history; physical examination; and routine blood tests. After the 3rd and 6th&#xD;
           cycle of study treatment, the patient will have tests to monitor the status of their&#xD;
           disease. These include PET scan, CT scans, and standard blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After 6 cycles of chemotherapy, approximately 3 weeks of radiation therapy will begin.&#xD;
           One month after completing radiation therapy, the patient will return to the clinic for&#xD;
           a physical exam and blood tests. One month later, the following evaluations will occur:&#xD;
           PET and CT scans; medical history; physical exam; routine blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There will be follow-up visits every 3 months for two years after the study treatment is&#xD;
           completed.&#xD;
