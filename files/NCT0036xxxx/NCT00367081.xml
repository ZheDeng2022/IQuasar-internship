      Neurological manifestations of Cerebral toxoplasmosis or Toxoplasmic encephalitis (TE) in&#xD;
      most advance stage HIV infected patients composed of fever, headache, alteration of&#xD;
      consciousness with focal neurological signs/symptoms such as include hemiparesis, cranial&#xD;
      nerve palsies, and ataxia. Generalised convulsions, in Â¾ of patients. Moreover meningeal&#xD;
      irritation sign or herniation sign may be presented as life threatening condition&#xD;

      Background: Toxoplasmic encephalitis (TE), caused by Toxoplasma gondii, is common in AIDS&#xD;
      patients. TE can result in tissue destruction via massive inflammation and brain abscess&#xD;
      formation. METHODS: Randomized controlled trials were performed in AIDS patients to assess&#xD;
      which drug regimen was optimally effective for the treatment of TE. AIDS patients with TE&#xD;
      were randomly divided into 3 groups that received a 6-week course of either pyrimethamine (50&#xD;
      mg/ day or 100 mg/day) plus sulfadiazine (4 g/day) and folinic acid (25 mg/day) or&#xD;
      trimethoprim (10 mg/kg/day) plus sulfamethoxazole (50 mg/kg/day) (TMP-SMX), and results were&#xD;
      evaluated with respect to clinical response, mortality, morbidity, and serious adverse&#xD;
      events. The primary outcome was defined as death in the first 6-week period. The secondary&#xD;
      outcome was successful treatment within 6 weeks without severe adverse events, bone marrow&#xD;
      suppression, drug-induced rash, or any other event that caused a change in the treatment&#xD;
      regimen. RESULTS: The results from this study showed that in AIDS patients, TE was most&#xD;
      successfully treated with the combination of pyrimethamine (50 mg/day) plus sulfadiazidine (4&#xD;
      g/day) and folinic acid (25 mg/day); failure rates were not significantly different among the&#xD;
      3 treatment groups. Conclusions: Available data suggest that of the currently available&#xD;
      options, treatment of TE with pyrimethamine at 50 mg/day plus sulfadiazidine at 4 g/day&#xD;
      provides the best primary outcome for AIDS patients with TE; however, because this study was&#xD;
      terminated prematurely, we suggest that treatment with intravenous TMP-SMX be further&#xD;
      evaluated to determine its efficacy.&#xD;
