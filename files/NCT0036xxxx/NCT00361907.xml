      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of Pulsatile Intravenous Insulin therapy&#xD;
      on circulating blood markers. These blood markers are selected due to their correlation to&#xD;
      and possible pathogenetic roles in vascular compromise and inflammatory malfunction in&#xD;
      diabetic patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Insulin produces vasodilatory, anti inflammatory and anti thrombotic effects (1-4). . However&#xD;
      the effects of pulsatile intravenous insulin delivery on circulating risk factors for&#xD;
      vascular and metabolic disease is unknown. This study is used to evaluate circulating risk&#xD;
      markers of vascular and metabolic disease compared to a matched control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol Patients selected have diabetes mellitus, 20 years of age and older, and are treated&#xD;
      with oral agents and/or insulin. The study is for a minimum of 12 months and may continue for&#xD;
      2-3 years if a significant difference is shown following the initial 12 months. Blood markers&#xD;
      will be determined every 12 months for the first year, and every 12 months after that. They&#xD;
      may include the following: BNP, fructosamine, PAI-1, fibrinogen, homocysteine, endothelin 1,&#xD;
      aldosterone, VCAM, ICAM, IGF-1, TGF-beta, TNF-alpha, hs-CRP, and IL-6). The results are&#xD;
      compared to an age and fructosamine matched control group.&#xD;

&#xD;
      The respiratory quotient (RQ) is a measurement of CO2 exhaled and O2 inhaled and is&#xD;
      proportionate to the fuel sources being used by the body, primarily the liver over short&#xD;
      periods of time. The higher the RQ, the more glucose and less alternative fuel sources are&#xD;
      being utilized. Following the RQ change helps determine the effectiveness of physiological&#xD;
      insulin administration in increasing anabolic functions in diabetic individuals. By improving&#xD;
      the body's glucose metabolism and thereby causing beneficial effects of anabolic factors, the&#xD;
      possibility of serious complications can be decreased. In addition the use of oral&#xD;
      carbohydrate at the same time along with the physiologic insulin administration stimulates&#xD;
      the appropriate gut hormones which augment this effect, a response which cannot be duplicated&#xD;
      with intravenous glucose. The purpose of our studies is to determine whether the physiologic&#xD;
      administration of pulsatile intravenous insulin along with the augmenting effect of oral&#xD;
      carbohydrates will normalize metabolism in diabetic patients and improve their quality of&#xD;
      life indices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RQ is determined by the use of a metabolic cart. Individuals breathe into a mask for 3-5&#xD;
      minutes after a rest period of 30 or more minutes. The ratio of exhaled volume of CO2 to the&#xD;
      inhaled volume of O2 is determined as the RQ. The physiologic range is 0.7 to1.3. Individuals&#xD;
      using fat as a primary fuel have a ratio of 0.7, protein or mixed fuels is 0.8-0.9 and&#xD;
      carbohydrate is 0.9-1.0. Those taking excessive calories will have RQ's higher than 1.05. The&#xD;
      RQ can be followed serially and this is done twice, before and after each treatment, during&#xD;
      the 3 successive sessions on a single treatment day. The amount of intravenous insulin and&#xD;
      oral glucose given is determined by the RQ changes during the previous session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pusatile intravenous insulin delivery is a process which encourages the glucose metabolism in&#xD;
      diabetics to normalize in multiple organs, especially muscle, retina, liver, kidney and nerve&#xD;
      endings. The process fundamentally requires the administration of high dose intravenous&#xD;
      insulin pulses similar to those found in non diabetic humans by their pancreas into the&#xD;
      surrounding portal circulation. Oral carbohydrates are given simultaneously to augment the&#xD;
      process and prevent hypoglycemia. The process is monitored by frequent glucose level&#xD;
      measurements and respiratory quotients (RQ). RQ is measured by a metabolic cart which&#xD;
      determines the ratio VCO2/ VO2. This ratio is specific for the fuel used at any one time by&#xD;
      the body. The glucose levels are monitored to keep glucose levels appropriate and the RQ&#xD;
      determines the need to readjust the infusion protocol in each patient for subsequent insulin&#xD;
      infusion sessions. Pulsatile intravenous insulin delivery is done over 1-hour periods with a&#xD;
      up to a 1-hour rest period between each session for three courses each day of activation.&#xD;
