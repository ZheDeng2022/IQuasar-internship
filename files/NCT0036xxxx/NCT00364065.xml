      The purpose of this study is to see if the Ferris PainWrap is effective in the treatment of&#xD;
      chronic low back pain.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a phase 4 study to determine if a semipermeable hydrophilic membrane marketed as&#xD;
      Ferris PainWrap can relieve low back pain more effectively than a placebo wrap. In the United&#xD;
      States, the prevalence of low back pain of at least 1 month's duration is about 15% and its&#xD;
      incidence is 5%. It is one of the two most common pain complaints. Low back pain is thus a&#xD;
      major health problem in this country and worldwide. Treatment that relieves low back pain and&#xD;
      restores function would be of great benefit to the individual and the community at large,&#xD;
      particularly if the treatment is convenient and has no significant adverse effects. Ferris&#xD;
      PainWrap was originally developed as a burn dressing and is commercially available for this&#xD;
      purpose. The Food and Drug Administration approved the material as Ferris Hydrophilic&#xD;
      Dressing for marketing in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of&#xD;
      the Medical Device Amendments. The material is classified as a medical device. It was found&#xD;
      to relieve pain, inflammation, swelling, and bruising over traumatized areas. Subsequently,&#xD;
      it appeared to relieve low back pain in informal, open (non-blinded) trials. The proposed&#xD;
      mechanism for low back pain relief is by alteration of cutaneous A-beta receptor and possibly&#xD;
      cutaneous A-delta fiber function through shifts in sodium and water concentrations in the&#xD;
      skin. This study will compare a &quot;no dose&quot; placebo to a &quot;high-dose&quot; back wrap. It is a one&#xD;
      year pilot study which will be randomized, double-blinded, and controlled, comparing Ferris&#xD;
      PainWrap to an identical appearing placebo back wrap in individuals with chronic low back&#xD;
      pain of three months duration or longer.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  English speakers, necessary to understand the protocol and communicate observations to&#xD;
             the investigators&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Low back pain of 3 months or longer. Acceptable conditions include non-specific low&#xD;
             back pain or pain associated with lumbar spondylosis without neurological impairment&#xD;
             associated with the stenosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Numerical Pain Rating Scale value of 4.5 or higher, estimated for the past week where&#xD;
             0=no pain and 10=worst possible pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pain must interfere in some way with daily activities, assessed by Roland and Morris&#xD;
             Disability Survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Beck Depression Inventory score of 20 or less.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Physical examination findings of tenderness, muscle spasm or taut bands, or myofascial&#xD;
             trigger points in the low back region. The low back region is defined as the&#xD;
             lumbosacral region, below the 12th thoracic vertebra down to the sacro-coccygeal&#xD;
             junction, and extending laterally to the plane of the lumbar vertebral transverse&#xD;
             processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  NPR rating score of less than 4.5.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Neurologic impairment in the legs (absent knee or ankle deep tendon reflexes,&#xD;
             dermatome sensory loss or weakness) that indicates lumbar radiculopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of cancer (previous diagnosis of cancer, or treated cancer with no sign of&#xD;
             recurrence for 5 years is acceptable).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of systemic disease that can cause low back pain (endometriosis, prostatitis,&#xD;
             chronic renal disease, recurrent urinary tract infections, or other acute infections,&#xD;
             not including simple upper respiratory infections without significant coughing).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pending litigation involving back injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Back related disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Lumbar laminectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects cannot have participated in other research studies within 3 months of&#xD;
             starting this study.&#xD;
