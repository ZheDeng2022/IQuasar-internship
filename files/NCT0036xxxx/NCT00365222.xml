      A single arm Phase 2 trial with the study drug temozolomide (temodar) for newly diagnosed&#xD;
      glioblastoma in elderly patients (defined as greater than or equal to 70 years old).&#xD;
      Following surgical resection, and confirmation of glioblastoma, patients will proceed to&#xD;
      primary chemotherapy with temozolomide (temodar). Temodar is given for 42 consecutive days on&#xD;
      and 14 days off occurring every 56 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures prior to initial study treatment (&lt;14 Days) are: Neurological/Oncological History,&#xD;
      Neurological Examination, Height, Weight, and Body Surface Area, Performance Status, Quality&#xD;
      Of Life FACT-BR, Labs, MGMT tissue analysis, and Cranial CT/MRI with and without contrast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same procedures are repeated on Day 1 of each treatment cycle with the addition of an&#xD;
      adverse event assessment. And the off study procedures for patients are performance status,&#xD;
      Quality Of Life FACT-BR, MGMT tissue analysis, and cranial CT/MRI with and without contrast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients may continue with each temodar daily dose therapy if clinical and&#xD;
      neuroradiographical exams are stable or improving.&#xD;

      A single arm Phase 2 trial with the study drug temozolomide (temodar) for newly diagnosed&#xD;
      glioblastoma in elderly patients (defined as greater than or equal to 70 years old).&#xD;
      Temozolomide will be administered orally (a capsule) at approximately the same time daily&#xD;
      (bedtime) for 42 days on and then 14 days off; cycles may be repeated every 56 days. Complete&#xD;
      blood counts will be obtained bi-weekly, evaluations monthly and MRI's every 2 months after a&#xD;
      cycle of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures prior to initial study treatment (&lt;14 Days) are: Neurological/Oncological History,&#xD;
      Neurological Examination, Height, Weight, and Body Surface Area, Performance Status, Quality&#xD;
      Of Life FACT-BR, Labs, MGMT tissue analysis, and Cranial CT/MRI with and without contrast&#xD;
      (all disease found at staging must be followed using the same modality used at Pre-treatment.&#xD;
      Tumor assessments are to be repeated every 56 days thereafter until progression). The same&#xD;
      procedures are repeated on Day 1 of each treatment cycle with the addition of an adverse&#xD;
      event assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients may continue on therapy unless one of the following occurs:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Documented or clinical progressive disease at any time&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Unacceptable toxicity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment delay of &gt; 2 weeks for any reason&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study data or other data indicate that the study treatment is not beneficial for the&#xD;
           patients; defined as at least one response in the first 12 patients within each tumor&#xD;
           histology strata&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non-compliance by the patient with protocol requirements (follow-up, treatment,&#xD;
           administration of disallowed therapy)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Changes in medical status of the patient such that the patient no longer meets&#xD;
           eligibility requirements (leptomeningeal spread, change in mental competency) or the&#xD;
           investigator believes that patient safety will be compromised.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient withdrawal of consent for treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Occurrence of one toxic death&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with CR, PR, or stable disease (SD) will be treated for a minimum of 3 cycles [6&#xD;
      months] or until disease progression. For patients responding to treatment, continuation of&#xD;
      therapy beyond 3 cycles is at the discretion of the investigator. Response parameters will&#xD;
      include the MacDonald criteria for evaluating brain tumors. Response is measured by a&#xD;
      reduction in tumor size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After cessation of protocol therapy, patients will continue to be followed for survival at&#xD;
      2-month intervals for up to three years from start of treatment. And the off study procedures&#xD;
      for patients are performance status, Quality Of Life FACT-BR, MGMT tissue analysis, and&#xD;
      cranial CT/MRI with and without contrast.&#xD;
