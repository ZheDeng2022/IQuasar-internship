  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study of a new experimental drug called darusentan. Darusentan is not&#xD;
      currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the United&#xD;
      States, which means that a doctor cannot prescribe this drug. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      determine if darusentan is effective in reducing systolic blood pressure in subjects with&#xD;
      resistant systolic hypertension, despite treatment with full doses of three or more blood&#xD;
      pressure lowering drugs, including a diuretic.&#xD;
