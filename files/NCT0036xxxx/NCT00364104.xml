  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that the Helicobacter pylori bacterium decreases iron from the&#xD;
      stomach and that this effect of the infection can be identified among persons with iron&#xD;
      deficiency as well as among persons with normal iron stores. The aim of this study is to&#xD;
      determine whether Helicobacter pylori eradication in children is followed by an increase in&#xD;
      markers of iron stores after six to twelve months of treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For the last 12 years, scientific evidence has mounted linking Helicobacter pylori infection&#xD;
      with iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia. Reports from around the world on several&#xD;
      cases of iron deficiency anemia refractory to iron supplementation among children infected&#xD;
      with Helicobacter pylori, most without evident ulcers, clearly indicate that such cases have&#xD;
      been cured of their anemia after receiving a course of Helicobacter pylori eradication&#xD;
      therapy. Several studies based on national surveys, including one on the U.S. National Health&#xD;
      and Nutrition Examination Survey data and conducted by the authors of this proposal, have&#xD;
      found an association between Helicobacter pylori infection and the levels of iron stores.&#xD;
      However, these studies fail to demonstrate that anemia follows Helicobacter pylori infection.&#xD;
      Moreover, most previous research has been conducted outside of the contiguous U.S. and has&#xD;
      not included young children, one of the high-risk populations for iron deficiency and iron&#xD;
      deficiency anemia. Data on this age-group is most needed to develop sound public health&#xD;
      interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to conduct such a study among children living in El Paso, Texas, a city located on&#xD;
      the U.S.-Mexico border. A series of studies have been conducted in that city by the authors&#xD;
      of this proposal, including a National Institutes of Health sponsored study aiming to&#xD;
      describe the natural history of Helicobacter pylori infection in children from birth to age&#xD;
      seven years (84 months). We hypothesize that the Helicobacter pylori bacterium decreases iron&#xD;
      from the stomach and that this effect of the infection can be identified among persons with&#xD;
      iron deficiency as well as among persons with normal iron stores. Currently, the clinical&#xD;
      management of the most extreme form of iron deficiency, that is iron deficiency anemia,&#xD;
      relies only on supplemental iron therapy. For ethical reasons, our study will identify&#xD;
      children with anemia from the study, and will assign them to one of the arms receiving iron&#xD;
      supplementation. Our study will determine whether a combination of iron supplementation and&#xD;
      sequential Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy yields higher increases of iron stores&#xD;
      than each of these treatments alone. To summarize, our main hypothesis is that Helicobacter&#xD;
      pylori infection is associated with iron deficiency such that Helicobacter pylori eradication&#xD;
      would result in an increase in the levels of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. serum ferritin,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. transferrin saturation, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. hemoglobin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test these hypotheses we will randomly assign 125 Helicobacter pylori-infected children (3&#xD;
      to 10 years of age) into each of the following four groups: Helicobacter pylori eradication&#xD;
      treatment, iron supplementation, Helicobacter pylori eradication plus iron supplementation,&#xD;
      or placebo. We plan to recruit infected children through a household survey in El Paso,&#xD;
      screen their Helicobacter pylori infection status by a stool test, and invite their parents&#xD;
      to undergo a confirmatory breath test. Infected children randomly allocated to those four&#xD;
      arms of the study will be followed closely during the 6 weeks they are taking the study&#xD;
      medication to record any adverse event, followed by a visit at 45 days after treatment to&#xD;
      tell whether or not those receiving the medication had their infection eradicated, between 6&#xD;
      and 12 months for hematological evaluation to compare with the baseline levels of iron&#xD;
      stores.&#xD;
