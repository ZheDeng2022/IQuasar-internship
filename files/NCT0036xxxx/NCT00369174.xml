  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well rosiglitazone works in preventing oral cancer in&#xD;
      patients with oral leukoplakia. Chemoprevention is the use of certain drugs to keep cancer&#xD;
      from forming, growing, or coming back. The use of rosiglitazone may keep cancer from forming&#xD;
      in patients with oral leukoplakia&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the rate of clinical response of oral premalignant lesions (OPL) to 12 weeks&#xD;
      of therapy with rosiglitazone (Avandia), 8 mg daily, defined as greater than or equal to 50%&#xD;
      reduction in the measured product of perpendicular dimension of the target lesion, or&#xD;
      improvement in the degree of dysplasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the rate and degree of change of putative biomarkers of rosiglitazone&#xD;
      efficacy including:&#xD;
&#xD;
      COX-2, cyclin D1, Ki-67, p21/waf1, PPAR gamma, K1 cytokeratin, involucrin, transglutaminase&#xD;
      expressions, and TUNEL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To estimate the correlation between DNA ploidy measurements in OPL with clinical response&#xD;
      and or response of biomarkers to rosiglitazone therapy, and to estimate the efficacy of&#xD;
      rosiglitazone therapy to normalize aberrant DNA ploidy in OPL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To thoroughly assess smoking patterns among trial participants and to examine the&#xD;
      relationship of smoking to treatment response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To assess the safety of this agent in short-term use in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, open-label, nonrandomized study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive oral rosiglitazone once daily. Treatment continues for 12 weeks in the&#xD;
      absence of unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1 week.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  If the subject is female and of childbearing potential (women are considered not of&#xD;
             childbearing potential if they are at least two years postmenopausal and/or surgically&#xD;
             sterile), she:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  has been using adequate contraception (abstinence, IUD, birth control pills, or&#xD;
                  spermicidal gel with diaphragm or condom) since her last menses and will use&#xD;
                  adequate contraception during the study, AND&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  The effects of rosiglitazone (Avandia) on the developing human fetus at the&#xD;

             has been associated with fetal death and growth retardation in rats and rabbits and&#xD;
             placental pathology in rats, women of child-bearing potential must agree to use&#xD;
             adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior&#xD;
             to study entry and for the duration of study participation; should a woman become&#xD;
