  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A recent survey of trends among the members of the American Society of Cataract and&#xD;
      Refractive Surgery determined that laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) is the leading&#xD;
      surgical procedure for photorefractive corrections ranging from -0 to 3 diopters (D).1 The&#xD;
      same survey, however, showed a clear trend of participating refractive surgeons toward&#xD;
      surface ablation. Photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) was the first refractive surgery&#xD;
      procedure approved and performed using the excimer laser. Several techniques of epithelial&#xD;
      debridement have been tried with PRK-type surgery including mechanical debridement, laser&#xD;
      transepithelial ablation, a rotating brush, and alcohol debridement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Amadeus II microkeratome (Advanced Medical Optics Inc, Irvine, CA, USA) used for the&#xD;
      creation of a LASIK flap has an upgradeable platform that will allow the user to perform&#xD;
      mechanical separation of the corneal epithelium before photorefractive treatments. With the&#xD;
      use of this device, the corneal epithelium can be separated from the underlying stroma&#xD;
      without previous preparation of the corneal surface with alcohol. The separated epithelial&#xD;
      sheet can either be removed or replaced on the operated cornea after photoablation. This&#xD;
      surgical procedure, which has been called Epi-LASIK, represents an advanced alternative&#xD;
      surface ablation photorefractive procedure for the correction of ametropia. The purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to evaluate the clinical visual outcomes, healing rates, and patient&#xD;
      satisfaction when performing surface ablation procedures using mechanical vs. alcohol&#xD;
      separation of the epithelium.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject must be a candidate for surface ablation procedures in both eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ≥ 18 years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Myopia ≤ -6.00 D.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Astigmatism ≤ - 3.00 D.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Manifest refraction spherical equivalent (MRSE) of -6.00 D.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Capable of wearing a bandage contact lens.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing and able to comply with scheduled visits and other study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of ocular pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Very large pupils (greater than 8mm diameter, infrared measurement).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Thin corneas (preoperatively calculated minimal residual bed &lt; 250 um).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If patient fit into the group of the usual exclusionary criteria (e.g. irregular&#xD;
             astigmatism, asymmetric astigmatism, unstable refraction - most of these patients&#xD;
             would not typically be considered LASIK candidates under normal circumstances).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of previous refractive surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Corneal irregularities potentially affecting visual acuity: keratoconus, corneal&#xD;
             dystrophy, corneal opacities.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in (or current participation) any investigational drug or device trial&#xD;
             within the previous 30 days prior to the start date of this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Intraocular conventional surgery within the past three months or intraocular laser&#xD;
             surgery within one month in the operated eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of any systemic or topical drug known to interfere with visual performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or nursing mothers and females of childbearing potential not practicing a&#xD;
             reliable and medically acceptable method of birth control&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability or unwillingness of subjects to give written informed consent.&#xD;
