    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical study is to compare the safety and effectiveness of shockwave&#xD;
      treatment combined with standard-of-care treatment, to standard-of-care treatment alone to&#xD;
      induce healing of a chronic plantar foot ulcer in subjects with diabetes mellitus. For the&#xD;
      purpose of this study, the definition of plantar foot ulcer is a wound or open sore that&#xD;
      involves the plantar(bottom) aspect of the foot, and the definition of chronic is a duration&#xD;
      of 6 weeks or greater with a lack of response to treatment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Diabetic foot complications are the most common cause of nontraumatic lower extremity&#xD;
      amputations in the industrialized world. The risk of lower extremity amputation ranges from&#xD;
      15 to 46 times higher in diabetics than in persons who do not have diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
      Furthermore, foot complications are the most frequent reason for hospitalization in patients&#xD;
      with diabetes, accounting for up to 25 percent of all diabetic admissions in the United&#xD;
      States and Great Britain. The vast majority of diabetic foot complications resulting in&#xD;
      amputation begin with the formation of skin ulcers. Early detection and appropriate treatment&#xD;
      of these ulcers may prevent up to 85 percent of amputations. (Armstrong)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal in the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers is to obtain wound closure. Rest,&#xD;
      elevation of the affected foot, and relief of pressure are basic treatments that are usually&#xD;
      initiated when the patient first presents with a foot ulcer. A postoperative shoe or another&#xD;
      type of pressure-relieving footwear is also often prescribed. Crutches or a wheelchair might&#xD;
      also be recommended to totally off-load pressure from the foot. Necrotic tissue is debrided&#xD;
      to allow full visualization of the extent of the ulcer, to allow detect underlying abscesses&#xD;
      or sinuses, and to support healing. Wet-to-wet dressings are used to provide a warm, moist&#xD;
      environment that is protected from external contamination is most conducive to wound healing.&#xD;
      Additional options include numerous topical medications and gels, and special dressings,&#xD;
      including semipermeable films, foams, hydrocolloids, and calcium alginate swabs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When these more conservative treatments fail, another recently developed nonoperative option&#xD;
      is available. The genetically engineered platelet-derived growth factor becaplermin (Regranex&#xD;
      Gel, OMJ Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) is approved for use on neuropathic diabetic foot ulcers and&#xD;
      can expedite healing. Growth factors stimulate chemotaxis and mitogenesis of neutrophils,&#xD;
      fibroblasts, and monocytes, as well as other components that form the cellular basis of wound&#xD;
      healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When nonoperative treatments fail, skin grafting is often required to achieve wound closure.&#xD;
      In addition to autologous donor tissue for the graft procedure, bioengineered skin (Apligraf,&#xD;
      Organogenesis, P950032/S016) and human dermis (Dermagraft, Smith &amp; Nephew, P000036) are new&#xD;
      types of biologically active implants approved for diabetic foot ulcers that are derived from&#xD;
      fibroblasts of neonatal foreskins. These bioengineered products enhance healing by acting as&#xD;
      delivery systems for growth factors and extracellular matrix components through the activity&#xD;
      of live human fibroblasts contained in their dermal elements. (Frykberg)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the variety of modalities available to treat diabetic foot ulcers, the US Center for&#xD;
      Disease Control reports that the age-adjusted lower extremity amputation rate for persons&#xD;
      with diabetes is 5.5 per 1,000 persons with diabetes, which is was 28 times that of persons&#xD;
      without diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ESWT for Soft Tissue Indications&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of extracorporeal shock waves for clinical applications was introduced in the United&#xD;
      States more than 20 years ago; the first indication for use approved by FDA was for treatment&#xD;
      of renal calculi (kideny stones). Since that time, the clinical applications of&#xD;
      extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) have been expanded to include treatment of chronic&#xD;
      proximal plantar fasciitis (P990086, HealthTronics OssaTron; P000048, Dornier EPOS Ultra;&#xD;
      P040026, Orthospec Extracorporeal Shock Wave Device; P040039, Orthometrix Orbasone Pain&#xD;
      Relief System) and chronic lateral epicondylitis (P990086/S003, HealthTronics OssaTron;&#xD;
      P010039, Siemens Sonocur Basic). In addition, there are numerous reports in the clinical and&#xD;
      pre-clinical literature of shockwave therapy used to treat orthopedic conditions such as&#xD;
      fracture non-unions, femoral head necrosis, and non-orthopedic conditions related to tissue&#xD;
      healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment with extracorporeal shock waves has been shown to be associated with&#xD;
      neovascularization in an animal model. Further, since several shockwave systems have been&#xD;
      approved through the PMA process for treatment of chronic proximal plantar fasciitis and&#xD;
      chronic lateral epicondylitis, there is a large amount of data regarding the safety of these&#xD;
      devices in treating soft tissue. The research done by Meirer et al. (2005) and by Nishida et&#xD;
      al. (2004) suggests that local delivery of shockwave therapy results in increased release of&#xD;
      growth factors and improved circulation in the wound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of the promising association between ESWT and tissue healing, the favorable risk /&#xD;
      benefit profile of the devices approved for treatment of soft tissue indications, and the&#xD;
      European clinical experience with ESWT for wound healing, it is hypothesized that&#xD;
      extracorporeal shock wave treatment (ESWT) could be beneficial in treating diabetic foot&#xD;
      ulcers. Therefore, this IDE describes a clinical study designed to determine the safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness of the DermaGoldÂ® ESW System when used to induce healing of chronic plantar&#xD;
      foot ulcers in patients with diabetic foot ulcers.&#xD;
