      The purpose of this study is to compare modified CI therapy for strokes survivors with very&#xD;
      limited function to an alternative package of conventional physical rehabilitation techniques&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Constraint-Induced Movement therapy or CI therapy is a rehabilitation method, based on&#xD;
      behavioral neuroscience studies of deafferented monkeys, that has been shown in controlled&#xD;
      studies to produce large improvements in real-world upper-extremity use in individuals with&#xD;
      chronic stroke. Up till now, survivors of stroke with plegic hands have been excluded from CI&#xD;
      therapy protocols, whether on a research or clinical basis. Such individuals are estimated to&#xD;
      make up at least 35% of the population with chronic stroke with residual motor deficit.&#xD;
      Furthermore, there are no other interventions for such individuals that have controlled&#xD;
      evidence of efficacy for increasing real-world function. Thus, these stroke survivors&#xD;
      represent a large number of healthcare consumers with limited treatment options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We recently completed a pilot study of a modified form of CI therapy for stroke survivors&#xD;
      with plegic hands, and obtained surprisingly positive findings. Six individuals were enrolled&#xD;
      who had a flicker of active movement at the elbow and at the wrist or a finger and 30° of&#xD;
      active range of motion at the shoulder. Participants received three weeks of CI therapy,&#xD;
      combined with other modes of therapy, for six hours per day. The treatment package included&#xD;
      tone management/movement facilitation, training of more-impaired arm use using shaping,&#xD;
      functional task practice, restraint of the less-impaired arm in the laboratory and at home as&#xD;
      indicated, and a package of behavioral methods for transferring gains from the laboratory to&#xD;
      the home situation. As a group, the patients showed a large improvement in more-impaired arm&#xD;
      use in daily life after treatment (Motor Activity Log or MAL; p's &lt; 05, Effect Size &gt; 1.5).&#xD;
      Improvements in more-impaired arm motor ability, as measured by scores on a laboratory motor&#xD;
      performance test (graded Wolf Motor Function Test; gWMFT) and standardized clinical&#xD;
      examination (Fugl-Meyer), were also substantial (p's &lt; .05).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these initial findings, we propose a randomized, controlled clinical trial to&#xD;
      rigorously test the efficacy of this modification of CI therapy for rehabilitating arm&#xD;
      function in chronic stroke patients with severe upper-extremity impairment. To this end, 40&#xD;
      survivors of stroke with plegic hands will be randomly assigned to receive the intervention&#xD;
      described above or a placebo control procedure of the same duration. Control participants&#xD;
      will receive either 1) tone management, EMG biofeedback and other procedures in alternating&#xD;
      blocks for 6 hr daily for 15 consecutive weekdays or 2) usual &amp; customary care. Measures of&#xD;
      arm motor ability (gWMFT; Fugl-Meyer), arm use in daily life (MAL, accelerometry), and&#xD;
      quality of life (Stroke Impact Scale) will be administered to all participants before and&#xD;
      after treatment and at long-term. If the modified CI therapy participants shows larger&#xD;
      improvements in more-impaired arm function than the control group participants, this will&#xD;
      suggest it is an efficacious treatment and raise hopes of additional recovery for a large&#xD;
      group of healthcare consumers with limited treatment options.&#xD;
