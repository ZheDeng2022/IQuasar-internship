      This study will examine whether transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the brain used in&#xD;
      combination with carbidopa-levodopa is more effective in temporarily improving the speed of&#xD;
      hand movement in stoke patients than TMS alone. In TMS, a wire coil is held on the patient's&#xD;
      scalp. A brief electrical current is passed through the coil, creating a magnetic pulse that&#xD;
      stimulates the brain. The effect of TMS on the muscles is detected with small metal disk&#xD;
      electrodes taped to the skin of the arms or legs. Carbidopa-levodopa is a medication usually&#xD;
      used to treat Parkinson's disease, but it may improve the effect of theta burst stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two kinds of TMS are used in this study. In single-pulse TMS one or two pulses are delivered&#xD;
      at a time in order to measure brain activity at that moment. In repetitive TMS (rTMS), a&#xD;
      series of pulses are given in short bursts, temporarily altering brain activity. The type of&#xD;
      rTMS used in this study is called theta burst stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy normal volunteers and people who had a stroke 6 months or more before entering the&#xD;
      study may be eligible to participate. All candidates must be between 18 and 90 years of age.&#xD;
      Stroke patients must have had significant hand weakness and made a moderate or good recovery&#xD;
      and must be able to move either the thumb or the wrist on the affected hand reasonably well.&#xD;
      Normal volunteers must be right-handed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants complete the testing for this study in four main sessions scheduled at least a&#xD;
      week apart and five short follow-up sessions. At each main session, participants take either&#xD;
      a carbidopa-levodopa tablet or a placebo (a look-alike inactive substance). Stroke patients&#xD;
      have their arm and hand function assessed using two tests. One requires them to insert pegs&#xD;
      into holes; the other includes writing, lifting various objects, and performing activities&#xD;
      like turning pages, feeding or stacking checkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects complete a questionnaire regarding their mood and alertness and then perform&#xD;
      tests of thumb or wrist movement. For this test, a small electrical stimulus is applied to&#xD;
      the side of the hand and the subject must respond to the stimulus as quickly as possible by&#xD;
      making a thumb or wrist movement. This is repeated several times over about 3 minutes. A&#xD;
      second test follows in which the subject moves the thumb or wrist in response to a beep from&#xD;
      a speaker. This test is repeated several times over about 8 minutes. Some measurements are&#xD;
      taken using single-pulse TMS during the beginning, middle and end of this test. In two of the&#xD;
      four sessions, theta burst stimulation is applied after the single-pulse TMS and in the other&#xD;
      two sessions, sham theta burst stimulation is applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Five follow-up sessions are scheduled one day after each main session and one week following&#xD;
      the final one. In these sessions, subjects perform an abbreviated form of the thumb movement&#xD;
      tests.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Theta Burst Stimulation (TBS) is a type of sub-threshold repetitive Transcranial Magnetic&#xD;
      Stimulation (rTMS) which has effects on the excitability of human motor cortex that outlast&#xD;
      stimulation by up to an hour. TBS also affects performance of a motor task for up to 30&#xD;
      minutes after stimulation in healthy subjects, and improves reaction times (and increases&#xD;
      corticospinal excitability) in patients with chronic stroke (Talelli 2005). The advantages of&#xD;
      TBS over other non-invasive brain stimulation strategies are its low intensity, short&#xD;
      duration of application and long lasting effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The spectrum of behavioral effects investigated is so far modest. Evidence is accumulating&#xD;
      that dopaminergic agents enhance synaptic plasticity (Otani 1998) and improve motor training&#xD;
      in healthy humans (Meintzchel 2005). After stroke, Carbidopa-Levodopa has also enhanced the&#xD;
      response to physiotherapy and motor learning (Scheidtmann 2001, Floel 2005). This protocol&#xD;
      aims to test the hypothesis that Carbidopa-Levodopa may enhance the beneficial effect of TBS&#xD;
      on reaction times in patients with chronic stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to investigate 18 patients with motor impairment more than 6 months after ischemic&#xD;
      stroke, and 10 healthy volunteers. Approval is sought for a total of 28 patients and 30&#xD;
      healthy volunteers to account for possible dropouts and pilot experiments (described below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will be asked to participate in 4 sessions, at least a week apart. The&#xD;
      experiment will test simple reaction times in the thumb or wrist of the paretic hand before&#xD;
      and 7 minutes after either genuine or sham TBS. This will be followed by a measure of motor&#xD;
      learning, using a well-characterized paradigm (Muellbacher 2001), which involves optimizing&#xD;
      an externally paced ballistic thumb (or wrist) movement, and TMS measurement of corticospinal&#xD;
      excitability. Performance of the learned task will be further assessed (and TMS measures&#xD;
      made) at 2 hours, 1 day and 1 week following the training session. The experimental design&#xD;
      for the four sessions will be 2x2 with TBS/sham and Carbidopa-Levodopa/placebo. For TBS, the&#xD;
      patient will be given 3 minutes of either genuine or sham TBS to the hand representation of&#xD;
      the motor cortex (Huang 2005). For Carbidopa-Levodopa/placebo, identical preparations from&#xD;
      the NIH pharmacy will be given 1 hour beforehand. TBS has previously been used in 72 healthy&#xD;
      subjects (7 studies) in Europe and in 10 patients with chronic stroke (2 studies) in the Lead&#xD;
      Associate Investigator's lab in London. No side effects or seizures have been reported. Ten&#xD;
      normal volunteers will be studied first to optimize experimental settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME MEASURES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure will be reaction times. Improvement in peak acceleration in the&#xD;
      learning task will constitute a secondary measure. We expect to see improved reaction times&#xD;
      with genuine TBS (vs. sham) and will look for an interaction whereby Carbidopa-Levodopa may&#xD;
      enhance this effect (vs. placebo). This would suggest that synergy between dopaminergic&#xD;
      modulation and TBS may show promise to produce clinical gains after stroke.&#xD;
