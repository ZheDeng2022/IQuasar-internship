  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a state of increased arterial stiffness of extensive vessel&#xD;
      calcifications, compared with the non-renal population. Both arterial stiffness and arterial&#xD;
      calcifications are potent predictors of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in ESRD&#xD;
      patients. Several studies have documented the direct relationship between the extent and&#xD;
      severity of arterial/coronary calcifications and outcome in dialysis patients. The&#xD;
      relationship is strong no matter if arterial calcifications were quantified by electron-beam&#xD;
      computed tomography or a radiological calcification score. Calcifications are early and&#xD;
      progressive events in these patients. PWV is strongly related to the degree of sonographic&#xD;
      determined arterial calcifications and EBCT-derived coronary artery calcium score in chronic&#xD;
      kidney disease patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calcium-based phosphate binders are associated with progressive coronary artery and aortic&#xD;
      calcification, especially when mineral metabolism is not well controlled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to recent studies, sevelamer hydrochloride is a potent non-calcium-containing&#xD;
      phosphate binder, well tolerated in ESRD. Compared with calcium-based phosphate binders,&#xD;
      sevelamer is less likely to cause hypercalcemia, low levels of PTH, and progressive coronary&#xD;
      and aortic calcification in hemodialysis patients. Moreover, sevelamer has a favorable effect&#xD;
      on the lipid profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Less is known about the relationship between sevelamer treatment and progression of arterial&#xD;
      stiffness. To date, there is one single study examining the influence of sevelamer (versus&#xD;
      calcium carbonate) on the evolution of arterial stiffness in a very small number (N=15) of&#xD;
      haemodialysis patients. These study used the same patients as historical controls, thus being&#xD;
      methodologically rather weak. Moreover, the follow-up was quite short - 6 month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the trial is to to quantify, in a randomized opened-labeled controlled trial the&#xD;
      effect of sevelamer hydrochloride on the evolution of arterial stiffness parameters (pulse&#xD;
      wave velocity and the augmentation index) in chronic haemodialysis patients and to correlate&#xD;
      these parameters with arterial calcification assessed by a previous described radiological&#xD;
      score of arterial calcification and echocardiographic parameters (left ventricular&#xD;
      hypertrophy, LV dilatation, systolic and diastolic dysfunction).&#xD;

      End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a state of increased arterial stiffness of extensive vessel&#xD;
      calcifications, compared with the non-renal population. Both arterial stiffness and arterial&#xD;
      calcifications are potent predictors of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in ESRD&#xD;
      patients. Underlying mechanisms for increased stiffness in uremia are not well-defined, but&#xD;
      may include: chronic fluid overload, arterial calcifications, microinflammation, increased&#xD;
      sympathetic hyperactivity, activation of the renin-angiotensin system, increased lipid&#xD;
      oxidation, and abnormalities of the nitric oxide system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have documented the direct relationship between the extent and severity of&#xD;
      arterial/coronary calcifications and outcome in dialysis patients. The relationship is strong&#xD;
      no matter if arterial calcifications were quantified by electron-beam computed tomography or&#xD;

      Sevelamer hydrochloride is a potent non-calcium-containing phosphate binder, well tolerated&#xD;
      in ESRD. Compared with calcium-based phosphate binders, sevelamer is less likely to cause&#xD;

&#xD;
      Less is known about the relationship between sevelamer treatment and progression of arterial&#xD;
      stiffness. To date, there is one single study examining the influence of sevelamer (versus&#xD;
      calcium carbonate) on the evolution of arterial stiffness in 15 HD patients. These study used&#xD;
      the same patients as historical controls, thus being methodologically rather weak. Moreover,&#xD;
      the follow-up was quite short - 6 month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to quantify, in a randomized opened-labeled controlled trial the&#xD;
      effect of sevelamer hydrochloride on the evolution of arterial stiffness parameters (pulse&#xD;

      these parameters with arterial calcification assessed by a previous described radiological&#xD;
      score of arterial calcification and echocardiographic parameters (left ventricular&#xD;
      hypertrophy, LV dilatation, systolic and diastolic dysfunction) 240 chronic clinical stable&#xD;
      (young-to-medium-aged)haemodialysis patients will be included. Follow-up: 12 month After&#xD;
      screening, the patients will enter a washout period for all currently used phosphate binders&#xD;
      for 2 weeks. All patients with hyperphosphatemia (&gt;1.8 mmol/l) during the wash-out period&#xD;
      eligible for randomization into the treatment phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stratification will consider the Framingham calcification score, age, gender, diabetes, HD&#xD;
      vintage The patient will be randomized (computer-generated) in a 1:1 ratio to open label&#xD;
      sevelamer (RenagelR) 800 mg tablets or calcium acetate 670 mg tablets. Because of the size,&#xD;
      appearance and taste of the tablets, neither the subjects nor the investigators will be&#xD;
      blinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adherence to treatment will be assessed by regular bill count. The starting dose of sevelamer&#xD;
      and calcium acetate determined by replacing the phosphate binder used by the patient prior to&#xD;
      the washout period on a gram to gram basis. The dose of phosphate binder should be titrated&#xD;
      to achieve a serum phosphorus level in the target range of 1-1.6 mmol/L and a serum calcium&#xD;
      level &lt;2.6 mmol/L. The maximum elemental calcium dose/day in the calcium acetate arm will not&#xD;
      exceed 1.5 g.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum ionized calcium will be adjusted for the serum albumin concentration using the formula:&#xD;
      adjusted Ca = total measured calcium +0.8 x (4.0-albumin g/dL). After 4 weeks, the dose of&#xD;
      phosphate binder, vitamin D analogue and the dialysate calcium concentration can be titrated&#xD;
      to reach the target range.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study conduction will be conducted strictly in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki&#xD;
      and Committees on Human Research in the participating centers/Universities The K/DOQI targets&#xD;
      for serum phosphate, serum-calcium and PTH are aimed during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data on intact parathormone, serum-calcium and phosphate, Ca-P product will be collected&#xD;
      monthly in the first three month, every 3 month later on.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitamin D allowance only if during the study PTH raise &gt; 500 pg/ml; vitamin D not at all if&#xD;
      serum calcium &gt;2.6 mmol/L&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  correlation between PWV, AIx, calcification scores and Ca-P metabolism parameters, lipid&#xD;
           parameters etc&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  capability of reaching the N/KDOQI guidelines regarding control of secondary&#xD;
           hyperparathyroidism - sevelamer hydrochloride versus calcium acetate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  stratification of PWV and AIx dynamics according to different categories The only&#xD;
           published reference in the literature is by Takenaka et al (NDT 2005); they showed in a&#xD;
           small study that after 6 months of sevelamer treatment PWV decreases from 14.56 m/s to&#xD;
           13.34 m/s i.e. a decrease of approximatively 9% from pre-Sevelamer values. If normalized&#xD;
           to BP (PWV divided by corresponding BP level) than PWV/BP decreased from 10.2 m/s/mmHg&#xD;
           to 9.3 m/s/mmHg - i.e. again a decrease of approximatively 9% from pre-Sevelamer values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of note, in the previous 6 months, while on CaCO3, PWV increased significantly by 30 to 40%&#xD;
      from baseline study values (study of Takenaka has a cross-over design: 6-months on CaCO3&#xD;
      followed by 6-months on Sevelamer). Also there is no information provided on AIx. There is no&#xD;
      information in the literature on the impact of Sevelamer on EID (GTN)- vascular function or&#xD;
      on EDD (flow-dependent hyperemia or beta2 agonist stimulation)-vascular function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our experience, the mean PWV is 7.19+/-1.88 m/s, or if corrected for corresponding BP&#xD;
      values: PWV/BP = 5.14 +/- 1.3 m/s/mmHg. AIx is typically 27.9±11.9% in HD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If we assume that the Sevelamer group (&quot;treatment group&quot;) will have the same 9% decrease in&#xD;
      PWV at 6 months, from baseline, the Ca-binder group (&quot;control group&quot;) will have no change&#xD;
      (i.e. no increase in PWV - &quot;conservative approach&quot;, but different from Takenaka's results&#xD;
      where an increase in PWV was reported - see above), the standard deviation of the PWV is 1.88&#xD;
      m/s in our experience or 1.3 m/s/mmHg, the ratio of 1 between the control and thre treatment&#xD;
      arms, than for a power of 80% and a confidence interval of 95% we need 108 patients in each&#xD;
      arm (105 if PWV/BP is used), 216 total. This will also have sufficient power detect a&#xD;
      decrease in AIx of only 4.6% or 16.5% from baseline in the treatment arm. This is usually&#xD;
      less than that recorded after different acute interventions (GTN, salbutamol, dialysis&#xD;
      session) or after transplantation in HD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compliance is good in our units and transplantation is rare. Therefore we expect only a&#xD;
      dropout rate of 10%. Thus the final study population should be 240 patients. 120 patients&#xD;
      should receive Sevelamer for 6 months.&#xD;
