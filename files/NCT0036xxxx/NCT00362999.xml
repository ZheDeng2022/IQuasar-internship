  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis to be proven is that histamine iontophoresis with measurement of microvascular&#xD;
      blood flow by laser Doppler flowmetry can be used as a reliable marker to characterize the&#xD;
      normal microvascular cutaneous response to histamine.&#xD;

      The specific aim of this study is to validate iontophoresis (with measurement of&#xD;
      microvascular blood flow by laser Doppler flowmetry) in a pediatric cohort as a surrogate&#xD;
      marker capable of reliably characterizing the normal physiologic response of the cutaneous&#xD;
      microvasculature to histamine. In future studies laser Doppler flowmetry ultimately will be&#xD;
      used to assess whether microvascular blood flow determined by a previously validated laser&#xD;
      Doppler technique can be used as a reliable surrogate endpoint capable of functionally&#xD;
      discriminating the effects of polymorphisms in the genes which are quantitatively important&#xD;
      for histamine metabolism. The hypothesis to be proven is that histamine iontophoresis with&#xD;
      measurement of microvascular blood flow by laser Doppler flowmetry can be used as a reliable&#xD;
      marker to characterize the normal microvascular cutaneous response to histamine.&#xD;
