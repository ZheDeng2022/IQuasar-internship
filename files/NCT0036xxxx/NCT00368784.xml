    <textblock>
      This study is designed to identify the cells of the immune system that cause skin disease&#xD;
      such as psoriasis and mycosis fungoides. Blood samples from many patients will be compared in&#xD;
      hopes of finding common cells and molecules responsible for skin diseases. Results of this&#xD;
      study will increase our knowledge about immune mediated skin disease.&#xD;

      The aim of the study is to characterized the T cell repertoire of individuals with immune&#xD;
      mediated skin disease (e.g. psoriasis and mycosis fungoides). Peripheral blood with be&#xD;
      collected from volunteers with psoriasis, mycosis fungoides and age matched controls. Fifteen&#xD;
      tablespoons of blood will be collected prior to the initiation of treatment and again after&#xD;
      the patient shows a clinical response to treatment. The time between blood draws will be no&#xD;
      less than 3 months. There will be no more than two blood draws per patient. Blood samples&#xD;
      will be used to determine the patient's HLA haplotype via PCR and DNA sequencing. After the&#xD;
      patient's haplotype has been established the activated T cell repertoire will be analyzed for&#xD;
      clonal expansions. Clonal expansions in the T cell repertoire will be determined by&#xD;
      immunoscope analysis, which is a PCR based technique.&#xD;
