    <textblock>
      Phase I dose escalation study of Triciribine Phosphate Monohydrate (TCN-PM) in patients with&#xD;
      metastatic cancer whose tumors must be shown to be p-Akt positive. Study patients will be&#xD;
      recruited from a Moffitt Cancer Center companion study (MCC-14474) &quot;Immunohistochemical study&#xD;
      of phosphorylated Akt in solid malignancies.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each treatment cycle will consist of four weeks with TCN-PM being administered weekly (days&#xD;
      1, 8 and 15 every 28 days). Labs, vital signs (BP, HR, Resp Rate, Temp), and hematology and&#xD;
      serum chemistry profile are to be performed weekly and/or prior to each treatment dose. Body&#xD;
      Surface Area (BSA) should be calculated approximately every 8 weeks. Imaging studies (CT/MRI&#xD;
      of chest, abdomen, and pelvis) and tumor response assessments will be performed every eight&#xD;
      weeks or more frequently if indicated. Unless unacceptable toxicity occurs, the duration of&#xD;
      treatment will be based on tumor reassessment.&#xD;

      Phase I dose escalation study of Triciribine Phosphate Monohydrate (TCN-PM) in patients with&#xD;
      metastatic cancer. Study patients will be recruited from a companion study [MCC-14474&#xD;
      &quot;Immunohistochemical study of phosphorylated Akt in solid malignancies&quot;], and potential&#xD;
      subjects tumors' must be shown to be p-Akt positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pretreatment evaluations are chest roentgenogram (CXR) and CT/MRI scans of the sites of known&#xD;
      disease, performance status, tumor biopsy, MUGA (EF only), and a pregnancy test. A CT/MRI&#xD;
      scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis known sites of disease is required at baseline and an&#xD;
      immunohistochemical (IHC) assay for determination of akt expression (positive) prior to study&#xD;
      drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each treatment cycle will consist of four weeks with TCN-PM being administered weekly(days 1,&#xD;
      8 and 15 every 28 days). Labs, vital signs (BP, HR, Resp Rate, Temp), and hematology and&#xD;
      serum chemistry profile are to be performed weekly and/or prior to each treatment dose. Body&#xD;
      Surface Area (BSA) should be calculated approximately every 8 weeks. Imaging studies (CT/MRI&#xD;
      of chest, abdomen, and pelvis) and tumor response assessments will be performed every eight&#xD;
      weeks or more frequently if indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Palliative and supportive care for other disease-related symptoms and for toxicity associated&#xD;
      with treatment will be offered to all patients on this trial. Unless unacceptable toxicity&#xD;
      occurs, the duration of treatment will be based on tumor reassessment done every eight weeks.&#xD;
