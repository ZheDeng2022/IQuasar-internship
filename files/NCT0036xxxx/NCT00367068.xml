      The objective of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of treatment with&#xD;
      intrathecal baclofen for severe spasticity in children with cerebral palsy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Spasticity in cerebral palsy (CP) is a serious problem leading to pain, sleep disturbance,&#xD;
      increased expenditure of energy and/or interference with positioning, transfers, dressing and&#xD;
      body hygiene. In later stages, secondary phenomena, such as contractures, decubitus and&#xD;
      heterotopic calcifications of joints or tendons may create large treatment problems. A&#xD;
      substantial group of children with severe CP does not respond to regular treatments, such as&#xD;
      physical therapy, orthopaedic surgery or oral medication. An effective treatment option for&#xD;
      intractable spasticity is the continuous delivery of intrathecal baclofen (CITB). In 2000,&#xD;
      the American Academy for Cerebral Palsy and Developmental Medicine (AACPDM) published a&#xD;
      systematic review on the body of evidence about intrathecal baclofen (ITB) for spasticity in&#xD;
      individuals with CP. It appeared that only a small and uncertain number of children had been&#xD;
      studied. Except for two case-reports, none of the studies solely concerned children. The&#xD;
      research methodology employed in three quarters of the available studies was not capable of&#xD;
      confirming treatment effect. The AACPDM underlined the need for further high-level research&#xD;
      in the form of prospective, randomized trials that use valid and reliable outcome measures in&#xD;
      well described and homogeneous groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 1998 the Dutch Study Group on Child Spasticity designed the Dutch national study on the&#xD;
      effectiveness and safety of ITB for refractory spasticity in children with cerebral palsy.&#xD;
      The Dutch national ITB study included four phases: 1] the selection phase, 2] the&#xD;
      double-blind, placebo-controlled dose-escalation test treatment phase, 3] the prospective,&#xD;
      randomized, open-label implantation phase and 4] the follow-up phase.&#xD;
