  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      10 healthy volunteers will be enrolled to each receive two subcutaneous injections of ISIS&#xD;
      113715 in the abdomen on Study Day 1. Each subject will receive their two injections within a&#xD;
      5-minute period. On Study Days 2 and 8, each subject's injection sites will be assessed for&#xD;
      dermatologic effects. The Isis Project Physician(s) will observe the injection sites on Study&#xD;
      Day 2 and may also observe on Study Day 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine clinical chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis tests will be performed on Study Day 1&#xD;
      and Day 8. Subjects will be contacted by telephone on Study Day 30 to monitor for the&#xD;
      occurrence of new serious adverse events (SAEs). Thereafter, the subjects will be discharged&#xD;
      from the study.&#xD;

      Following a two-week period for subject screening, 10 eligible subjects will be dosed&#xD;
      subcutaneously with ISIS 113715 on a single calendar date (Study Day 1). Each subject will&#xD;
      receive two subcutaneous injections given within a 5-minute period. The first injection will&#xD;
      be 200 mg ISIS 113715 given in 1.0 mL and will be injected about 7.5 cm to the left of the&#xD;
      umbilicus. The second injection will be 200 mg ISIS 113715 given in 2.0 mL and will be&#xD;
      injected about 7.5 cm to the right of the umbilicus. Both injections will be delivered using&#xD;
      3.0-mL syringes outfitted with 30-gauge, 0.5-inch needles. To further minimize variability,&#xD;
      all injections will be performed by a single individual, the Investigator or his designee,&#xD;
      employing uniform technique for all of the injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dermatologic responses at injection sites will be assessed at 1 and 7 days after the&#xD;
      injections (Study Days 2 and 8, respectively). Effects will be evaluated through completion&#xD;
      of the Injection Site Assessment Questionnaires by the Investigator and the recording of&#xD;
      adverse events reported by the subject or observed by the Investigator. The Isis Project&#xD;
      Physician(s) will observe the injection sites on Study Day 2 and may also observe on Study&#xD;
      Day 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine clinical chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis tests will be performed on Study Days&#xD;
      1 (prior to administration of ISIS 113715) and 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be contacted by telephone on Study Day 30 to monitor for the occurrence of new&#xD;
      serious adverse events. Thereafter, the subjects will be discharged from the study.&#xD;
