  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical activity as treatment for patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Treatment of T2D is&#xD;
      often done by medication, changing the diet and increased physical activity. It is well&#xD;
      established that physical training has a positive effect on the pathology of T2D such as&#xD;
      increased insulin sensitivity and reduced fasting plasma glucose (7) and blood lipids (15).&#xD;
      It is also well known that in healthy subjects endurance training increases mitochondrial&#xD;
      density, lipid oxidation during submaximal exercise, and results in a number of qualitative&#xD;
      changes in the control of OXPHOS (24). However, the effect of physical training on the&#xD;
      mitochondrial function in skeletal muscle of patients with T2D has not been investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this project is to investigate the effect of physical training on the&#xD;
      mitochondrial respiratory function in muscles of patients with T2D. Skeletal muscle biopsies&#xD;
      will be taken before and after 10 weeks of physical training in patients with T2D and matched&#xD;
      control subjects. Mitochondria will be isolated from the muscle biopsies, and respiratory&#xD;
      function, free radical production and UCP3 will be determined. Furthermore, measures of&#xD;
      maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max), heart rate and capillary lactate concentrations and&#xD;
      carbohydrate and lipid oxidation will be determined partly to verify an increased aerobic&#xD;
      capacity and partly to investigate the changes in these factors in T2D patients.&#xD;
