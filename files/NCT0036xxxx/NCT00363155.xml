      The purpose of this trial is to determine the safety, tolerability and effectiveness of&#xD;
      KRN7000 for chronic hepatitis B infection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      KRN7000 is reported to inhibit HBV replication in HBV transgenic mice. Anti-viral effects of&#xD;
      KRN7000 can be expected in HBV, as the compound is able to induce not only IFN-alpha/beta but&#xD;
      also IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha. In two clinical trials, KRN7000 was safe in both healthy&#xD;
      volunteers and solid cancer patients; particularly, the compound has not been reported to&#xD;
      show drug-related serious adverse events. A phase I/II trial is of significance in assessing&#xD;
      the safety and efficacy of KRN7000 treatment for CHB patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 300 microgram/m2 dose level, comparable to 10 microgram/kg, can be considered as the&#xD;
      highest safe dose level for the phase I/II trial for CHB patients with 3 dose levels. Dose&#xD;
      incrementation will be performed in a logarithmic manner: 0.1, 1 and 10 microgram/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the phase I trial for solid tumor patients, weekly administration of KRN7000 did not allow&#xD;
      sufficient time for NKT cell recovery. As KRN7000 is reported to be an activating ligand for&#xD;
      NKT cells, it is logical to assume that a dosing interval that provides time for recovery of&#xD;
      NKT cells is optimal. In fact, cytokine production after repeating dosing, when NKT cells&#xD;
      were hardly detected in the peripheral blood, was not observed. As it took approximately 4&#xD;
      weeks for NKT cells to recover to pre-dose levels after a single administration, monthly&#xD;
      administration is now proposed for this trial.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chronic hepatitis B (confirmed by a liver biopsy performed within 3 years prior to the&#xD;
             screenings visit and HBV DNA in serum &gt;10E5 copies/ml at the screenings visit).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ALT &gt; 1.2 x ULN on two occasions documented within 8 weeks before initiation of&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able and likely to attend regularly for treatment and follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate contraception for males and females during treatment and follow-up (written&#xD;
             confirmation).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with evidence of cirrhosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Decompensated liver disease, as marked by: bilirubin greater than 20 micromol/L or&#xD;
             serum albumin &lt;35 g/L or prothrombin time greater than 3 seconds prolonged or Quick&#xD;
             test below 70% or history of bleeding esophageal varices, ascites or hepatic&#xD;
             encephalopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Systemic IFN treatment, systemic antiviral agents, systemic corticosteroids, immune&#xD;
             suppressive treatment or any investigational drug within 3 months of entry to this&#xD;
             protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with ALT levels greater than 10 times ULN will not be enrolled but may be&#xD;
             followed until three consecutive determinations within 2 months are below this level.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy, or in women of child-bearing potential or in spouses of such women,&#xD;
             inability to practice adequate contraception.&#xD;
