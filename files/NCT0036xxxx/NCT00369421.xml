  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers intend on diagnosing and treating certain inborn errors of metabolism. By doing&#xD;
      this researchers hope to expand their knowledge about these disorders and provide access to&#xD;
      patients of interest for research, teaching, and clinical experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients participating in this study will be examined and treated on an out patient basis, if&#xD;
      practical. However, patients requiring specialized tests or treatments will be admitted to&#xD;
      the NIH Clinical Center as necessary. Researchers will use only accepted medical procedures&#xD;
      in diagnosing (medical history, physical examinations, X-ray studies, eye examinations, blood&#xD;
      tests, and urine tests) and treating the patients involved in this study. Additional tests&#xD;
      may be required on a case to case basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many patients seen in this study will go on to be enrolled in a specific disease-related&#xD;
      research study.&lt;TAB&gt;&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We propose to characterize the etiology and natural history of rare inborn errors of&#xD;
      metabolism and other genetic disorders, both known and yet-to-be discovered. In so doing, we&#xD;
      will expand our knowledge about these disorders and provide access to patients of interest&#xD;
      for research, teaching, and clinical experience. Individual patients seen under this protocol&#xD;
      have prompted the establishment of specific disease-related protocols involving intensive&#xD;
      natural history studies and innovative therapies. In the past, this protocol provided an&#xD;
      avenue for admitting patients as part of the NIH Undiagnosed Diseases Program (UDP).&#xD;
      Currently, this protocol continues its longstanding role in investigating individuals who are&#xD;
      of interest to the Section on Human Biochemical Genetics or to the protocol s Associate&#xD;
      Investigators.&#xD;

        -  Inclusion/Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients enrolled in this protocol will have been referred with a known or suspected inborn&#xD;
        error of metabolism, heritable disorder, or genetic predisposition. Examples include&#xD;
        inherited developmental defects or diatheses toward infections, cancer, or an&#xD;
        environmentally induced disease. The principal investigator, along with consulting&#xD;
        specialists, will review the medical records of prospective subjects and offer admission&#xD;
        based upon the potential to help the individual, to learn from the patient, or to initiate&#xD;
        clinical or basic research suggested by the patient s workup. This protocol is not intended&#xD;
        to serve as an umbrella protocol for small studies of specific disorders. In general, no&#xD;
        more than 5 families known to have the same disorder will be investigated under this&#xD;
        protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Some subjects will be relatives of patients with known diagnoses, and their specimens will&#xD;
        be obtained for the purpose of heterozygote testing or to serve as controls to help&#xD;
        diagnose the proband. All subjects shall be admitted as inpatients or outpatients at the&#xD;
        discretion of the principal investigator, based upon particular research interests and&#xD;
        expertise.&#xD;
&#xD;
        We will not admit patients under one month of age to this protocol. This exclusion occurs&#xD;
        because there is no urgency for a very early diagnosis and care is more readily proffered&#xD;
        to older individuals at the Clinical Center. Patients under two years of age will be&#xD;
        admitted only if they are medically stable and require admission to the Clinical Center for&#xD;
        diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Normal adult volunteers will be enrolled to provide control blood and urine specimens. NIH&#xD;
        employees and members of their immediate families may participate in this protocol as&#xD;
        normal volunteers. We will follow the Guidelines for the Inclusion of Employees in NIH&#xD;
        Research Studies and will give each employee a copy of the NIH information sheet on&#xD;
        Employee Research Participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For NIH employees:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Neither participation nor refusal to participate will have an effect, either&#xD;
             beneficial or adverse, on the participant s employment or work situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The NIH information sheet regarding NIH employee research participation will be&#xD;
             distributed to all potential subjects who are NIH employees.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The employee subject s privacy and confidentiality will be preserved in accordance&#xD;
             with NIH Clinical Center policies, which define the scope and limitations of the&#xD;
             protections.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. For NIH employee subjects, consent will be obtained by an individual independent of&#xD;
             the employee s team. Those in a supervisory position to any -12- employee and&#xD;
             co-workers of the employee will not obtain consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The importance of maintaining confidentiality when obtaining potentially sensitive and&#xD;
             private information from co-workers or subordinates will bereviewed with the study&#xD;
             staff at least annually and more often if warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Vulnerable subjects (e.g., children and adults unable to provide consent) are included&#xD;
        because their investigation under this protocol can lead to diagnosis, prognosis, therapy,&#xD;
        and membership in a community devoted to improving their lives.&#xD;
