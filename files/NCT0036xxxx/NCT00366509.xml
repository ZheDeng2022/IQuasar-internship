  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine bacteria and toxins in the mouth, lung and digestive system that may&#xD;
      be the cause of various diseases or symptoms. H. pylori is a bacterium that produces various&#xD;
      toxins that may contribute to lung problems. This study will examine specimens collected from&#xD;
      the mouth, teeth, lung, digestive tract and blood to measure H. pylori and its toxins and&#xD;
      their effects on cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People 18 years of age and older with or without gastrointestinal disease may be eligible for&#xD;
      this study. These include people without a history of lung disease as well as patients with&#xD;
      any of the following: lymphangioleiomyomatosis, asthma, sarcoidosis, other chronic or genetic&#xD;
      lung disease (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis or eosinophilic&#xD;
      granuloma).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may undergo the following tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urine tests, chest x-ray.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurement of arterial blood gases: A small needle is placed in an artery in the&#xD;
           forearm to collect arterial blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lung function tests: Subjects breathe deeply and occasionally hold their breath. They&#xD;
           may also receive a medication that expands the airways.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fiberoptic bronchoscopy with lavage and bronchial brushing: The subject's mouth and&#xD;
           throat are numbed with lidocaine; a sedative may be given for comfort. A thin flexible&#xD;
           tube called a bronchoscope is advanced through the nose or mouth into the lung airways&#xD;
           to examine the airways. Saline (salt water) is then injected through the bronchoscope&#xD;
           into the air passage and then removed by gentle suction. Next, a small brush is passed&#xD;
           through the bronchoscope and an area of the airway is brushed to collect some cells for&#xD;
           examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mouth rinsing or teeth brushing to collect cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Endoscopy: A small needle and catheter (thin plastic tube) are placed into an arm vein&#xD;
           to administer fluids and medications through the vein. A sedative may be given. The&#xD;
           throat is numbed with lidocaine and a thin flexible tube called an endoscope is inserted&#xD;
           through the mouth and down the esophagus into the stomach and upper part of the small&#xD;
           intestine to examine those areas.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vacuolating cytotoxin A (VacA toxin), an 88-kDa multifunctional protein, and other toxins are&#xD;
      produced by Helicobacter pylori. We hypothesize that H. pylori, VacA toxin, and other toxins&#xD;
      within the gastrointestinal tract and/or oropharynx are also found in the lung and may&#xD;
      contribute to decline in lung function. Analyses of gastrointestinal, oropharyngeal, lung and&#xD;
      blood specimens will improve the understanding of H. pylori, VacA toxin, and other toxins as&#xD;
      well as their potential role in pathophysiology of disease. The objectives of this&#xD;
      exploratory protocol are to procure gastrointestinal, oropharyngeal, lung and/or blood&#xD;
      specimens from healthy research volunteers and subjects with lung disease (e.g.,&#xD;
      lymphangioleiomyomatosis, asthma, sarcoidosis, pulmonary fibrosis) and to analyze these&#xD;
      specimens for H. pylori, VacA toxin, and other toxins. We hypothesize that the toxins may&#xD;
      have a role in the pathogenesis of lung disease and in the subclinical decline in lung&#xD;
      function seen with aging.&#xD;
