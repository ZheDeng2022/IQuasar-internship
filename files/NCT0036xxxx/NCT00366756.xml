      This study involves the use of VisionQuest 20/20 which is a new software program to test&#xD;
      visual acuity in children. The purpose of this study is to compare the results of VisionQuest&#xD;
      20/20 to two other ways to measure visual acuity. The two other tests are a standard eye exam&#xD;
      by an ophthalmologist and electronic visual acuity (EVA) testing, a computerized version of a&#xD;
      standard eye test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is important to identify vision problems in children as early as possible. These problems&#xD;
      include amblyopia (&quot;lazy eye,&quot; or reduced vision due to lack of development in the visual&#xD;
      area of the brain), strabismus (eyes are not aligned correctly due to eye muscle problems),&#xD;
      and refractive errors (when you need glasses to see up close or far away). Early&#xD;
      identification of the vision problems allows them to be treated earlier which makes it more&#xD;
      likely that vision can be improved. VisionQuest 20/20 can be easily distributed to schools,&#xD;
      and it is easy for the child and the vision screener to use. The test can be performed by&#xD;
      volunteers instead of an ophthalmologist.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Assessing visual acuity represents one of the most sensitive techniques for the detection of&#xD;
      eye abnormalities in children. Vision disorders are the fourth most common disability in the&#xD;
      USA and are the most prevalent handicapping condition in childhood. Ocular conditions, if&#xD;
      undetected or untreated, can have substantial long-term implications for the quality of life&#xD;
      of the child and the family and can place a burden on public health resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Important causes of visual impairment in children include amblyopia, strabismus and&#xD;
      significant refractive error. Children with these conditions may benefit from early detection&#xD;
      to allow treatment. Early detection and treatment is the key for successful management of&#xD;
      children with visual disorders. If detected during childhood, treatment for amblyopia is&#xD;
      effective and inexpensive. Although amblyopia is a treatable disorder if detected in&#xD;
      childhood during the brain's &quot;critical period&quot; for vision development, every year the problem&#xD;
      goes undetected and untreated in thousands of US children resulting in permanent visual&#xD;
      disability for the individuals and hundreds of millions of dollars of annual economic loss to&#xD;
      society. Furthermore, other less serious types of childhood vision problems, such as&#xD;
      refractive errors, may contribute to academic underperformance if not identified during&#xD;
      childhood. What ages, venues, and methodologies are best to perform vision screenings and&#xD;
      when full eye examinations are indicated remains to be determined. , Nevertheless, nearly&#xD;
      universal agreement exists among U.S. government agencies, health experts, educators, and&#xD;
      charitable vision organizations that children should be screened for visual disorders, even&#xD;
      if asymptomatic. To date, a combination of scientific, logistical, economic, and legislative&#xD;
      shortcomings have prevented vision screening goals from being met for many U.S. children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ideal vision screening method should be accurate (sensitive and specific for clinically&#xD;
      significant visual problems amenable to treatment), standardized, easy to administer and&#xD;
      interpret with little training, cost effective, universally available to children, and&#xD;
      capable of collecting data to ensure medical follow-up is received by those who need it as&#xD;
      well as to collect epidemiological information and monitor the success of the program year&#xD;
      after year. The Amblyopia Foundation of America (AFA) has conceptualized how automated&#xD;
      computer software which assesses vision while a child &quot;plays&quot; a video game could potentially&#xD;
      meet the requirements for an ideal vision screening system for children old enough to&#xD;
      cooperate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Young children are increasingly familiar with computers and videogames, oftentimes being more&#xD;
      sophisticated in their use than their parents. Vision screening software is easy to&#xD;
      distribute via CDs or the internet. Computers are readily available in virtually all schools&#xD;
      and the cost of computer technology continues to decline even as performance improves.&#xD;
      Computer software applications allow standardization of logic protocols for vision screenings&#xD;
      and the videogame format allow for automated testing. Automated testing eliminates the need&#xD;
      for large scale training and certification of vision screening proctors and instead can allow&#xD;
      vision screenings to be performed by untrained lay volunteers or personnel already available&#xD;
      in schools. Finally, since responses of children being tested are inputted directly into the&#xD;
      computer, results may be printed instantaneously at the end of testing. Computer data may be&#xD;
      warehoused locally or offsite via the internet to help coordinate medical follow-up for those&#xD;
      children identified at risk, monitor the success of the program, and facilitate&#xD;
      epidemiological analysis of vision disorders. Prototype VisionQuest 20/20 software currently&#xD;
      performs standardized visual acuity assessments of each eye and stereopsis testing while a&#xD;
      child &quot;plays&quot; a 2-3 minute video game.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pilot study (O'Neil J.W., et al 2005 unpublished) suggested lay screeners using this an&#xD;
      early version of this prototype vision screening software on laptop computers achieved&#xD;
      similar positive and negative predictive value results to a certified ophthalmic technician&#xD;
      using a professional grade M&amp;S vision tester. Positive predictive values for clinically&#xD;
      significant visual disorders were 54% for M&amp;S and 52% for VisionQuest 20/20 respectively.&#xD;
      Negative predictive values were identical at 97% for each screening method. VisionQuest 20/20&#xD;
      appears to have potential for use as a vision screener for schoolchildren and may allow more&#xD;
      children to be reached than manual vision screening or other methods by relying on lay&#xD;
      personnel already available in schools rather than certified vision screeners or eye&#xD;
      professionals to perform screenings. Additional benefits include use of computers already&#xD;
      available in schools with the potential to simplify vision screening logistics and reduce&#xD;
      costs. Independent validity testing is essential before initiating large scale community&#xD;
      vision screenings with this new vision screening software. The primary aim of the current&#xD;
      study is to validate VisionQuest 20/20 screening software by assessing its ability to screen&#xD;
      for threshold visual acuities as compared to an exact visual acuity obtained with the EVA&#xD;
      tester using ETDRS optotypes. The secondary aim of the current study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      ability of VisionQuest 20/20 software to detect the presence or absence of clinically&#xD;
      significant vision disorders in children as compared to a professional eye examination by a&#xD;
      pediatric ophthalmologist.&#xD;
