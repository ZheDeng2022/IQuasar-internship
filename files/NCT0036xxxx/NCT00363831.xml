      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the efficacy of capecitabine in combination with oxaliplatin (XELOX) in&#xD;
           terms of overall response rate (based on RECIST criteria) in patients with metastatic&#xD;
           NPC without prior chemotherapy for relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the efficacy profile of oxaliplatin (XELOX) in patients with metastatic NPC&#xD;
           in terms of time to progression of disease, survival time, duration of response and&#xD;
           complete response rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study the safety and tolerability of the regimen in patients with metastatic NPC.&#xD;
