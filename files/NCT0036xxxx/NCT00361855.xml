  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Certain types of cells located in bone marrow may help the body recover after an injury.&#xD;
      These cells may be able to help the body repair heart muscle that has been damaged from a&#xD;
      heart attack. NX-CP105 is a new investigational drug that is made up of these special types&#xD;
      of bone marrow cells, which come from another person. NX-CP105 has not been approved for sale&#xD;
      or general use by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and this study will be the first&#xD;
      time that NX-CP105 is given to human beings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is being conducted to see if there are any side effects associated with with&#xD;
      NX-CP105 and whether NX-CP105 may help the body repair heart muscle that has been damaged&#xD;
      from a heart attack. Three different doses of NX CP105 will be tested in this study, starting&#xD;
      with the lowest dose first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who decided to participate in the study will have a heart catheterization procedure&#xD;
      during which a narrow tube is inserted into an artery (type of blood vessel) in the groin and&#xD;
      passed to the heart. A second narrow tube will be inserted into a vein (type of blood vessel)&#xD;
      in the groin and passed to your heart. A device will be passed through the second tube. This&#xD;
      device will be used to inject NX-CP105 cells directly into your heart muscle.&#xD;

      Each patient will go through three phases during the study. The first is the&#xD;
      screening/baseline phase, the second is the treatment phase, and the third is the follow-up&#xD;
      phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The procedures that are required during the SCREENING/BASELINE PERIOD can be done in a&#xD;
           doctor's office outside of the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients will be asked about their past medical conditions and the medicines you&#xD;
                are taking.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients will be asked how often you get chest pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients will have a complete physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patient vital signs (temperature, blood pressure, pulse and breathing rate) and&#xD;
                weight will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients will give blood (about 2 tablespoons) and urine for routine laboratory&#xD;
                tests, to see if you have been infected with certain viruses (HIV, Hepatitis B,&#xD;
                Hepatitis C, CMV) and to test to determine blood type. A pregnancy test will be&#xD;
                done if patients are capable of getting pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients will have an electrocardiogram (ECG - a painless heart beat tracing).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients will be asked to walk as fast as they can for six minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients will have an x-ray type of test called a nuclear scan (SPECT) of your&#xD;
                heart. A very small amount of a radioactive material will be injected into a vein&#xD;
                during this test, which allows the doctor to evaluate blood flow in the heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients will have an echocardiogram, a procedure that uses sound waves to look at&#xD;
                the position, size, and movement of heart valves and heart wall, as well as the&#xD;
                direction of blood flow within the heart chambers. A solution that improves the&#xD;
                ability of the echocardiogram device to look at the heart will be injected into a&#xD;
                vein as part of this procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients will be asked to wear a Holter monitor (a very small ECG machine) for 24&#xD;
                hours that will be worn around the neck in a Velcro pouch or in the shirt pocket.&#xD;
                The monitor will be attached to the chest by three small adhesive patches and will&#xD;
                be used to collect heart beat information. Patients will take off the patches after&#xD;
                24 hours and return the monitor to the study doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the TREATMENT PERIOD patients will be kept in the hospital for at least 3 days&#xD;
           during which they will receive the new investigational drug (NX-CP105).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients will need to be admitted to the hospital about a day before thet receive&#xD;
                the study drug (bone marrow cells). During this time patients will have a procedure&#xD;
                called cardiac catheterization. The study doctor will make a small puncture in the&#xD;
                groin after the area is numbed with a local anesthetic (similar to Novocaine use by&#xD;
                a dentist). Two thin catheters (tubes) will be placed in the groin area, one in a&#xD;
                vein and one in an artery (large blood vessels). Blood thinners will be given&#xD;
                during this procedure to help prevent blood clots. A series of thinner tubes&#xD;
                (catheters) will then be inserted into the first tubes and will be carefully pushed&#xD;
                up into the heart chambers. These catheters will be used to produce a 3-dimensional&#xD;
                colored map (NOGA) that shows where the heart has been damaged. When mapping is&#xD;
                complete, this catheter will be taken out and a new device with a needle in the tip&#xD;
                will be run through the tubes. Using the map of your heart, the doctor will inject&#xD;
                NX CP105 into parts of the heart that look like they were damaged.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  After NX-CP105 is injected, all the tubes will be removed. After these procedures,&#xD;
                patients will have another echocardiogram to look for heart or other problems that&#xD;
                may have happened during the procedure. Patients will then be admitted to the&#xD;
                intensive care unit (ICU) for at least 24 hours. Patients will remain in the&#xD;
                hospital for at least 72 hours (3 days) after receiving NX-CP105.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Before leaving the hospital, patients will have another physical examination,&#xD;
                including vital sign measurements and ECGs. Blood and urine laboratory safety&#xD;
                samples will be collected&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The FOLLOW-UP PERIOD lasts 12 months. Patients will be asked to return to the study&#xD;
           doctor for regular visits on Day 7, Day 14, Day 21, and 2 months, 3 months, 6 months and&#xD;
           12 months after receiving NX CP105. At each study visit, patients will be asked to do&#xD;
           the following things:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Answer questions about any symptoms that you have had since the last study visit,&#xD;
                including any chest pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Have a physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Have vital signs will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Give blood for routine laboratory tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Have an ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Wear a Holter Monitor for 24 hours (except at the 6 and 12 month visits).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Have a six minute walk test (at the 3 and 6 month visits only).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Have a nuclear scan (SPECT) of the heart (at the 3 and 6 month visits only).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Have an echocardiogram (at the 3 and 6 month visits only).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients will also be admitted to the hospital to have another cardiac&#xD;
                catheterization and NOGA mapping procedure when you come back for the 3 month&#xD;
                follow-up visit.&#xD;
