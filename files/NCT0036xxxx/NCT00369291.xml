      RATIONALE: Giving CpG 7909 after an autologous stem cell transplant may make a stronger&#xD;
      immune response and prevent or delay the recurrence of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of CpG 7909 in&#xD;
      treating patients who have undergone autologous stem cell transplant.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine whether CpG 7909 enhances immune function, as measured by the response to&#xD;
           keyhole limpet hemocyanin (neo-antigen) and tetanus toxoid (memory antigen), in patients&#xD;
           who have undergone autologous stem cell transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine if dose escalation of CpG 7909, within a range of previously tested safe doses&#xD;
           of CpG 7909, impacts upon the primary immune readouts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a non-randomized, dose-escalation study of CpG 7909.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive CpG 7909 subcutaneously (SC) on days 1, 7, and 14. Patients receive keyhole&#xD;
      limpet hemocyanin SC and tetanus toxoid SC on day 7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of Cp6 7909 until the maximum tolerated dose&#xD;
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6&#xD;
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. A total of 10 patients are treated at the MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood is collected at baseline and at approximately day 40 for immunological studies,&#xD;
      including immunoenzyme techniques, antibody response assays, and immunophenotyping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have undergone autologous transplantation for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma&#xD;
             (NHL), Hodgkin's disease, acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), germ cell tumors, or&#xD;
             multiple myeloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be eligible for and consent to participate in study MT1999 06 -&#xD;
             Vaccination with tetanus toxoid and Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin (KLH) to assess antigen&#xD;
             specific immune responses (BB-IND 10430).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients will be eligible to receive CpG 7909 and vaccines on or after day 60 post&#xD;
             transplant. No patients are eligible for this protocol beyond day 74 post transplant.&#xD;
             Therefore, all patients will start therapy on this protocol between days 60-74 post&#xD;
             transplant to allow for patient scheduling flexibility.&#xD;

             and IV fluids.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Minimum laboratory values within 2 weeks of entry: Creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dl or CrCl ≥ 50&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with one or more of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active infection, or fever &gt;38.2˚C&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant nonmalignant disease including documented HIV infection, uncontrolled&#xD;
             hypertension (diastolic blood presses &gt;115 mmHg), unstable angina, congestive heart&#xD;
             failure (NY Class II), poorly controlled diabetes, coronary angioplasty within 6&#xD;
             months, myocardial infarction with the last 6 months, or uncontrolled atrial or&#xD;
             ventricular cardiac arrhythmias.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  It is unknown whether CpG 7909 may exacerbate autoimmune disorders by its&#xD;
             immunomodulatory effects. Therefore, subjects with a history of autoimmune disease&#xD;
             should not receive CpG 7909. Controlled thyroid disease is permissible.&#xD;
