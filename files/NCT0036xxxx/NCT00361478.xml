      The study investigates the effect of the 'Mother and Baby' (M&amp;B) program on the psychological&#xD;
      health and well-being of new mothers 6-10 weeks following the birth of their baby. The M&amp;B&#xD;
      program is an 8-week program of group exercise and education sessions provided by various&#xD;
      health professionals. The design of the study is a comprehensive cohort design, including a&#xD;
      randomised controlled trial. The primary outcome measure is the Affect Balance Scale. The&#xD;
      hypotheses are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The M&amp;B program has a positive effect on new mothers' psychological health and&#xD;
           well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The M&amp;B program increases participation in regular physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. the M&amp;B program benefits first time mothers more than women who have had more than one&#xD;
           child.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      The benefits of exercise, in particular group exercise, for women in early motherhood include&#xD;
      improved body image, decreased anxiety, improved energy and building of social networks.&#xD;
      Exercise has also been shown to be beneficial in the management of mood disorders such as&#xD;
      depression and more specifically, postnatal depression. However there has been no suggestion&#xD;
      that exercise may reduce symptoms of psychotic disorders that require medication, psychiatric&#xD;
      therapy and possible hospitalisation. The number of women experiencing postnatal depression&#xD;
      (PND) has increased to one in five women following childbirth. Some of the risks of&#xD;
      development of PND include lack of social support during the childbearing year and lack of&#xD;
      involvement in the community. new mothers have identified that reasons for inactivity include&#xD;
      no child care, limited opportunity to exercise with their baby, reduced self-esteem, poor&#xD;
      body image, or they are too busy. Research to date is limited and qualitative in nature, with&#xD;
      no standardised measurement tools used to assess quality of life in postnatal women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 'Mother and Baby' (M&amp;B) program is an 8-week program involving one hour of group exercise&#xD;
      with mothers and their babies conducted by a physiotherapist and a 30-minute education&#xD;
      session provided by various health professionals (physiotherapist, nutritionist, speech&#xD;
      pathologist, psychologists and midwives). Education topics include baby massage, nutrition&#xD;
      for mothers, introducing solids, adjusting to a new lifestyle, communicating with the baby,&#xD;
      sun care for the baby and play development. The aim of the study is to explore the benefits&#xD;
      of the M&amp;B program on new mothers' psychological and physical well-being as well as the&#xD;
      social benefits of exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      The design of the study is a comprehensive cohort design incorporating a randomised&#xD;
      controlled trial (RCT)of the effects of the M&amp;B program on the health of health women 6-10&#xD;
      weeks following the birth of their baby. The cohort design will complement the results of a&#xD;
      classic RCT by allowing the investigation of outcomes in a setting that simulates the&#xD;
      'real-world' treatment process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women who have had their babies at the Angliss Hospital and are ready for discharge will be&#xD;
      invited to participate in the study. Potential participants will be asked if they have a&#xD;
      preference for the M&amp;B program or Education sessions only, or if they would be willing to be&#xD;
      part of an RCT. Those who agree to be part of the RCT will be randomised to M&amp;B or Education&#xD;
      only sessions. Allocation will be controlled by the chief investigator and will be concealed,&#xD;
      with codes placed in opaque sealed enveloped. Randomisation will be stratified according to&#xD;
      parity (first time mothers vs multiparous) and blocked in groups of 16.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive and complete a questionnaire booklet and will return this in a&#xD;
      pre-paid envelope. Questionnaires include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The Affect Balance Scale. This is the primary outcome measure. It is a highly reliable&#xD;
           scale comprising ten questions indicating psychological reactions (positive and&#xD;
           negative) to events in daily life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. This is a widely used scale for the detection of&#xD;
           risk factors for postnatal depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Questions regarding exercise. Three questions regarding exercise will be asked and&#xD;
           answers will be compared to tables of the number of metabolic equivalents (METS)&#xD;
           required to perform the activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Program evaluation. Participants undertaking the M&amp;B program will complete a&#xD;
           standardised evaluation form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
      A preliminary power calculation has been conducted from studies using the Affect Balance&#xD;
      Scale in similar settings. With 80 subjects per group we will have 80% power to detect a 1.4&#xD;
      unit difference between the two groups. An advantage of 1.4 units (or 7% to 10% across a&#xD;
      scale) is regarded as a clinically important difference. A pilot study will be undertaken to&#xD;
      confirm the sample size.&#xD;
