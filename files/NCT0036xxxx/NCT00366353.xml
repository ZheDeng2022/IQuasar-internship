      An important part of how we decide when a patient is ready to have their breathing tube&#xD;
      removed is to have a person breathe without any machine breaths while the breathing tube is&#xD;
      still in place. We call this a spontaneous breathing trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Commonly, while patients have the breathing tube, they are given medications to keep them&#xD;
      sedated and comfortable so breathing does not bother them. These medicines are often stopped&#xD;
      before the spontaneous breathing trial so they can be more awake for the test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are signs the doctors look for during the spontaneous breathing trial that suggest the&#xD;
      patient might not be ready for the breathing trial to come out. Signs like fast breathing,&#xD;
      small breaths, a fast heart rate, or looking more anxious than usual may mean that the&#xD;
      patient is not ready to come off the ventilator. However, if someone has been given sedation&#xD;
      medicines the entire time they have had a breathing tube and are then woken up, they may&#xD;
      naturally get very anxious. They may show the same signs as someone who is failing their&#xD;
      breathing test, but in their case these signs are only because they are anxious.Doctors may&#xD;
      mistake these signs as failing the breathing test and may not pull the breathing tube out&#xD;
      even though the patient is really ready for it to come out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We wish to try and find out if patients do better during their spontaneous breathing trials&#xD;
      if they are continued on some sedative medicines to treat anxiety or if they do better if the&#xD;
      medicines are stopped before the test.&#xD;

      All intubated patients cared for by the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU)team during the&#xD;
      study period will be evaluated. After 24 hours of mechanical ventilation, patients not&#xD;
      meeting any exclusionary criteria will be considered for entrance into our trial. We will&#xD;
      attempt to obtain consent as soon as the 24 hour period is fulfilled, even if the patient is&#xD;
      not ready for extubation at that point. This is to maximize the success rate for obtaining&#xD;
      consent without delaying the SBT when the patient is clinically ready. Given the nature of&#xD;
      this protocol, we expect that the informed consent will primarily be obtained from the&#xD;
      patient's family member or POA. For all patients who regain competency, they will be&#xD;
      re-consented for permission to use their data that has been collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once patients are consented, they will be followed daily by the study investigators. When the&#xD;
      order is written by the MICU team for the patient to undergo a SBT, the patient's level of&#xD;
      consciousness will be evaluated by the nursing staff using the RASS. If the patient's score&#xD;
      is &lt;(-2), they will notify the study investigators. The patient will then be randomized by&#xD;
      sealed envelope to one of two study groups. Group 1 will immediately undergo their SBT while&#xD;
      still sedated. Group 2 will have their sedation held. Once their RASS score is 0 or higher&#xD;
      and they can follow simple commands (holding up two fingers to command), they will be&#xD;
      initiated on their SBT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard duration of an SBT by protocol is 2 hours. The duration of SBT may be shorter at&#xD;
      the discretion of the ICU attending physician. Additionally, the standard ventilators&#xD;
      settings for an SBT is 10 cm of Pressure Support and 5 cm of PEEP (positive and expiratory&#xD;
      pressure). This may vary some by the attending's preference though we encourage the use of&#xD;
      the standard setting during the study unless there is a clear need to deviate from the&#xD;
      protocol. This is to limit the confounding impact that differing levels of Pressure Support&#xD;
      may have on the parameters tracked. Patients who are felt to be failing the SBt will be&#xD;
      placed back on fill ventilator support at any point directed by the MICU team. Given the lack&#xD;
      of objective criteria to define failure of SBT, there are no clear criteria defined and the&#xD;
      decision that a patient is failing their SBT will be determined by the attending physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nursing staff will be provided with a documentation form (Data sheet 1) and asked to annotate&#xD;
      heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, tidal volume, oxygen saturation, and RASS score&#xD;
      at 0, 15, 30, 60 minutes and at the conclusion of the SBT.They will be inserviced on the&#xD;
      protocol prior to the start of the study. The study investigators will collect demographic&#xD;
      information and record it on Data sheet 2. In addition to the primary endpoint(changes in&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary parameters and RASS collected by the nursing staff), secondary endpoints will&#xD;
      include outcome of first SBT(pass or fail), time from randomization to extubation, outcome of&#xD;
      the first extubation (Data sheet 1). As stated earlier, there are no clearly defined cut-off&#xD;
      values for any of the monitored variables that define failure of an SBT.&#xD;
