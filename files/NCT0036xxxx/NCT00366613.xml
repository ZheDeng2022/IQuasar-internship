  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study involves using both a device that seals the capsular bag (where the lens is&#xD;
      located) allowing safer irrigation of the capsular bag and sodium chloride to irrigate the&#xD;
      capsular bag during cataract surgery on children. The purpose of this study is to determine&#xD;
      if the use of the device, Perfect Capsule, along with sodium chloride reduces the development&#xD;
      of posterior capsule opacification (PCO), a possible complication of cataract surgery. PCO is&#xD;
      the clouding of the rear portion of the natural membrane or capsule that holds the artificial&#xD;
      lens. It requires additional procedures to correct the problem. Sodium chloride is not&#xD;
      usually used during cataract surgery. It will be used to irrigate the capsular bag and remove&#xD;
      any residual cells that contribute to the development of PCO. Perfect Capsule will prevent&#xD;
      the sodium chloride from touching other parts of the eye. The goal of this study is to&#xD;
      determine if irrigation with sodium chloride will lower the incidence of PCO after cataract&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;

      Dramatic advances have occurred in the treatment of childhood cataracts in the last 10 years.&#xD;
      Intraocular lens implantation (IOL) has been universally accepted as standard of care in&#xD;
      children beyond 2 years of age. Despite advances in cataract surgery in children, PCO&#xD;
      remained a significant complication following pediatric cataract surgery. In addition to&#xD;
      being visually disturbing, it also induces amblyopia in children and if not treated at&#xD;
      earliest, irreversible visual changes may occur. The younger the child, more acute is the&#xD;
      problem: PCO occurs faster and effect of amblyopia is more pronounced. PCO generally requires&#xD;
      second surgical intervention, as closure of the opening made by YAG capsulotomy is very&#xD;
      common after pediatric cataract surgery. Many times, children are not cooperative to sit down&#xD;
      for YAG capsulotomy, and that may also be an additional indication for second surgery for&#xD;
      PCO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Removal of residual epithelial cells is one of the key factors to avoid the complication of&#xD;
      PCO. Several chemicals have been suggested in experimental settings to remove or kill these&#xD;
      residual lens epithelial cells. However, they are toxic to other ocular structures.&#xD;
      Researchers are searching for a device which can help to selectively kill these lens&#xD;
      epithelial cells. In the long term, this may help to avoid PCO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perfect Capsule: Perfect CapsuleTM (Milvella ltd) is a sterile single use ophthalmic&#xD;
      instrument used to perform sealed irrigation of the capsular bag during cataract surgery in&#xD;
      order to facilitate irrigation of the capsule without the irrigation fluid contacting other&#xD;
      ocular structures. The device has the FDA approval via 510(k) in the USA, and is CE marked in&#xD;
      Europe. No specific age limit has been listed for FDA approval. The device (see fig) consists&#xD;
      of a 7 mm diameter head, a 3 mm wide body and a 4 mm wide foot that remains external to the&#xD;
      eye. The head of the device comprises a circumferential vacuum channel connected to a vacuum&#xD;
      syringe via a vacuum tube. The central portion of the head forms a plug with an&#xD;
      irrigation/aspiration (I/A) channel (the body) which extend through the cornea allowing&#xD;
      fluids to be injected into the under surface of the plug and thus into the capsule. The&#xD;
      device has an internal diameter of 5 mm, is molded in medical grade silicone, packaged and&#xD;
      gamma sterilized. It can be easily rolled or folded to pass through the standard corneal&#xD;
      incision into the eye and positioned on the anterior surface of the capsule using standard&#xD;
      ophthalmic instrument.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concentrated Sodium Chloride: Concentrated Sodium Chloride injection, USP 23.4% (American&#xD;
      Regent Laboratories, Inc., Shirley, NY) is sterile, preservative free, nonpyrogenic solution&#xD;
      of Sodium Chloride in water for injection. Deionised water has been shown to lyse lens&#xD;
      epithelial cells through osmotic flow. Concentrated Sodium Chloride is not currently&#xD;
      indicated for intraocular use and is also expected to affect the corneal endothelium. Use of&#xD;
      Perfect Capsule will help to avoid the contact of Concentrated sodium Chloride to the&#xD;
      endothelial cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the purpose of this study, Concentrated Sodium Chloride for injection will be colored&#xD;
      with minimal fluorescein so that the flow and location of it can be visualized throughout the&#xD;
      procedure. Viscoelastic within the anterior chamber will provide additional protection for&#xD;
      the corneal endothelium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SCI with Perfect Capsule and Concentrated Sodium Chloride: Perfect CapsuleTM allows for the&#xD;
      empty capsular bag to be irrigated with Concentrated Sodium Chloride. A previous study in&#xD;
      rabbits has shown that toxic solutions can be safely used for SCI. It has also been shown&#xD;
      that the irrigation solution is contained within the capsular bag when SCI is performed in&#xD;
      humans. Dr. Auffarth has presented a summary of the two year Australian study results and one&#xD;
      year European multi-center clinical trial results performing SCI with distilled water in&#xD;
      humans (At American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery meeting, 2005). In 44 patients&#xD;
      studied, the system could be used without complication and the endothelial cell count and&#xD;
      corneal pachymetry was not different from the control eyes. Visual acuity development over a&#xD;
      6-12 months period was similar in both groups. Retro-illumination photographs showed a higher&#xD;
      incidence of fibrosis and anterior capsule whitening in the control group compared to the SCI&#xD;
      group. With the currently available IOLs, PCO is not a significant complication in adult eyes&#xD;
      at 1-2 year postoperative period. Long-term results will be needed to detect the difference&#xD;
      (if any) in terms of PCO in adult eyes. In contrast, PCO is a significant problem in&#xD;
      pediatric eyes. It occurs at a much faster rate and during early postoperative period in&#xD;
      children's eyes as compared to adult's eyes. Younger the child at the time of cataract&#xD;
      surgery, more acute is the problem. Thus, it is possible to see the difference in terms of&#xD;
      PCO (if any) with the use of Perfect Capsule in children's eyes during early postoperative&#xD;
      period, as 1 year postoperatively in this study. We are not aware of any published results or&#xD;
      results presented at the meeting showing use of SCI or distilled water in pediatric eyes.&#xD;
