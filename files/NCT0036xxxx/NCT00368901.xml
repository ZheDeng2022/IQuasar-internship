      To assess the effect of Aranesp_ on the hemoglobin (Hgb) of CRI subjects who are recombinant&#xD;
      human erythropoietin (rHuEPO)-naïve or converting from rHuEPO therapy. To assess the&#xD;
      association between subject self-reported health-related quality of life (HRQoL) as it&#xD;
      relates to Hgb concentration and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in subjects who were&#xD;
      rHuEPO-naïve prior to study enrollment. To characterize the health-related resource&#xD;
      utilization of subjects with CRI. To characterize the subject satisfaction with Aranesp_&#xD;
      compared to previous rHuEPO therapy. To characterize iron treatment in subjects with CRI. To&#xD;
      assess the safety profile of Aranesp_ therapy in subjects with CRI&#xD;

             of ≤ 70 mL/min, or GFR ≤ 60 mL/min (using the MDRD formula):&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cockcroft-Gault formula: CrCl = (140 minus age in years) x (body weight in kg) serum&#xD;
             creatinine (mg/dL) x 72.0 For women, the value will be multiplied by 0.85&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  MDRD formula: GFR = 170 x [SCr]-0.999 x [Age]-0.167 x [0.762 if subject is female] x&#xD;
             [1.180 if subject is black] x [sun] -0.170SAlb]-0.318&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  mean Hgb &lt; 11 g/dL during the screening/baseline period (if subject is not already&#xD;
             receiving rHuEPO therapy)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  for subjects currently receiving rHuEPO therapy, the subject must have: a stable&#xD;
