  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the CF&#xD;
      trans-membrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. CF is the most common inherited disease&#xD;
      of Caucasians, with a carrier frequency of 1 in 25-30 individuals. Even with the impressive&#xD;
      advances achieved in the understanding of the molecular basis and physiopathology of CF, it&#xD;
      remains a life-threatening disorder that causes severe lung damage and nutritional&#xD;
      deficiencies. It is generally accepted that early therapy could delay the progression of lung&#xD;
      disease. A number of non-invasive methods are available to monitor disease activity in CF&#xD;
      patients; however none of the currently used tools are able to monitor real-time events.&#xD;
      Recently high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) has been used to monitor changes in lung&#xD;
      structure. However, HRCT does not allow differentiating between acute and chronic lesions.&#xD;
      Positron emission tomography (PET) with 18fluoro-deoxy-glucose (FDG) has already been used in&#xD;
      a variety of settings to visualize inflammation or infection. FDG-PET imaging appears to be a&#xD;
      promising new tool to quantify inflammation as it can detect clinically relevant changes even&#xD;
      when no changes or minimal ones are detected by morphologic imaging. PET/CT may consequently&#xD;
      be used to evaluate the severity of lung inflammation/infection in CF patients, and therefore&#xD;
      the aim of this study is to evaluate the use of PET/CT for the assessment of the severity of&#xD;
      lung inflammation/ infection in CF patients.&#xD;

      Cystic fibrosis patients with active lung disease will undergo a high resolution&#xD;
      PET-CT.PET/CT scans (GE ST Discovery PET/CT scanner) will be performed 60 to 90 minutes after&#xD;
      injection of 5 MBq/kg of FDG. PET/CT will be repeated at the end of the treatment and&#xD;
      compared with the results of the initial scan. PET and CT will be interpreted by a certified&#xD;
      nuclear medicine physician and by a certified radiologist, respectively, blinded to clinical&#xD;
      data, using the PET severity score (PSS), based on the number and the intensity of FDG uptake&#xD;
      of lung foci. Intensity of uptake will be determined by calculating the mean value for the&#xD;
      maximum standardized uptake values (MSUV) of all foci.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (SUV = Activity concentration in ROI (region of interest) divided by injected dose / patient&#xD;
      body weight). SUV will be measured in normal lungs to receive the normal baseline control for&#xD;
      the calculations. The correlation with clinical data (FEV1% predicted) and sputum&#xD;
      bacteriology will then be performed. Inflammation status will also be followed by cytokine&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
