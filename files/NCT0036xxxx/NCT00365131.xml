    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, prospective study of the efficacy of Cerezyme in treating&#xD;
      patients with skeletal manifestations secondary to Type I Gaucher disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study objective is to evaluate and quantify skeletal responses as compared to baseline in&#xD;
      Type I gaucher disease patients receiving Cerezyme therapy for 48 months. Additional&#xD;
      objectives were to assess the usefulness of various skeletal parameters, such as bone pain,&#xD;
      bone crises, bone mineral density, and serum and urine bone markers, as indicative of&#xD;
      treatment response and may be useful in dose management.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Signed informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Confirmed diagnosis of Type I Gaucher disease, with no prior enzyme replacement&#xD;
             therapy, gene therapy or bone marrow transplantation, and who are ambulatory.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 10-65 (patients 66-70 years of age are considered on a case-by-case basis&#xD;
             following careful medical review).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) of the femoral nech with a T-score ≤ -1.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  One of more of the following signs as documented by X-ray, computed tomography (CT),&#xD;
             or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or symptoms of bone disease as documented in the&#xD;
             patient's medical history or baseline examinations: a). history of at least one bone&#xD;
             crises; b). Erlenmeyer flask deformity of the femora in children (10-17 years old);&#xD;
             c). osteoarticular necrosis; d). medullary infarctions; e). lytic lesions; f).&#xD;
             pathological fractures or fractures related to Gaucher disease; g). marrow&#xD;
             infiltration to a degree such that Rosenthal's Magnetic Resonance Score was ≥ 3; h).&#xD;
             bone density by quantitative computed tomography (QCT) or DEXA ≥ 1.5 standard&#xD;
             deviation (SD) below age-adjusted normal value; and i). fat fraction ≤ 17%.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  More than 1 joint replacement (revision surgery such as repair or replacement of a&#xD;
             previously replaced joint is allowed).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant, lactating or per-menopausal women.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active, uncontrolled infection, such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C or human&#xD;
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major concurrent disorders (i.e. cancer, renal disease) or disorders known to affect&#xD;
             bone (e.g. uncontrolled thyroid disease, hyperparathyroidism, hypoparathyroidism,&#xD;
             gastrectomy, malabsorption, inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis,&#xD;
             ankylosing spondylitis).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Medications known to affect bone homeostasis (e.g. chronic oral corticosteroids,&#xD;
             anticonvulsants, phenytoin and phenobarbital, hyper-physiological doses of estrogen,&#xD;
             defined as &gt; 0.625mg, or androgens, bisphosphates, calcitonin) within the first 2&#xD;
             months of the first Cerezyme infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Emotional, behavioral or psychological problems, which in the judgment of the&#xD;
             principal investigator, would interfere with the patient adequately complying with the&#xD;
             requirement of the study.&#xD;
