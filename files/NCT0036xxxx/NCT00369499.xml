      The primary objective of this Study is to compare the effect of transcatheter device closure&#xD;
      of atrial shunting to a non-closure control group over a period from cessation of procedure&#xD;
      related medication at 3 months until 9 months post randomization by determining the&#xD;
      proportion of patients that experience a 50% or more reduction in the baseline monthly&#xD;
      migraine attack frequency in each group.&#xD;
