    <textblock>
      This is a phase I trial of nimotuzumab that will be conducted in patients with advanced&#xD;
      incurable solid tumors. This is a dose-seeking study to determine the maximum tolerated and&#xD;
      recommended phase II doses of nimotuzumab that can be safely given to patients with advanced&#xD;
      and/or metastatic solid tumors.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, dose-escalating, phase I trial of nimotuzumab in patients with&#xD;
      advanced incurable solid tumors. The objective of this study is to determine the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of nimotuzumab that can be&#xD;
      given in a weekly schedule in patients with advanced and/or metastatic solid tumor cancer.&#xD;
      This study will also examine the safety, pharmacodynamics and preliminary efficacy of&#xD;
      nimotuzumab in this patient population.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Advanced and/or metastatic solid tumors, refractory to standard curative therapy, or&#xD;
             for which no curative therapy exists.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically or radiologically documented disease. Patients must have measurable&#xD;
             disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least&#xD;
             one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as &gt; 20 mm with conventional&#xD;
             techniques or as &gt; 10 mm with spiral CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Archival tumor specimens evaluable for expression of the EGFR (but EGFR positivity is&#xD;
             not a requirement for study entry).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have tumor lesions accessible for biopsy for correlative studies. In&#xD;
             cases where there are medical contraindications to tumor biopsies, exceptions may be&#xD;
             made upon discussion with the Principal Investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt; 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status of 0,1,2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous therapy: Previous chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, radiation and/or surgery is&#xD;
             permitted with certain restrictions as outlined in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hematology and chemistry lab results within specifications outlined in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willingness to give written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be accessible for treatment and follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Protocol treatment is to begin within 2 working days of patient registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or lactating women. Both men and women enrolled on study should be using&#xD;
             adequate birth control measures throughout the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of second malignancy who have a disease-free interval of less than two years&#xD;
             (except cervical cancer in situ or nonmelanomatous skin cancer).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Untreated brain or meningeal metastases. Patients with treated and stable brain&#xD;
             metastases are eligible providing that they have radiologic evidence of disease&#xD;
             stabilisation of at least 3 months duration and are asymptomatic.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Untreated and/or uncontrolled cardiovascular conditions and/or have symptomatic&#xD;
             cardiac dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active or uncontrolled infections, or with serious illnesses or medical conditions&#xD;
             which would not permit the patient to be managed according to the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior therapy with EGFR targeting therapies, including monoclonal antibodies or small&#xD;
             molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Allergy to the antibody.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent treatment with other experimental drugs or anti-cancer therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability or unwillingness to give written, informed consent prior to study&#xD;
             participation.&#xD;
