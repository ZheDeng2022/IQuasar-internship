      diabetic macular edema.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Overall 80% of diabetic patients with low vision are in the nonproliferative stage and the&#xD;
      main cause of decreased visual acuity is macular edema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the early treatment diabetic retinopathy study (ETDRS), the treatment of choice&#xD;
      for diabetic macular edema (DME) is laser therapy, which may be neither effective nor&#xD;
      curative in some patients.There are many cases which are refractory to laser treatment or not&#xD;
      suitable candidates for it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Corticosteroids might have a beneficial effect on DME. They have been used with different&#xD;
      doses and routes (periocular,intravitreal,and slow released implants) for a variety of&#xD;
      retinal diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, a few prospective randomized studies, concerning the effect of intravitreal&#xD;
      triamcinolone acetonide (IVT) on DME have been published. In their two-year results, Gillies&#xD;
      et al. concluded that IVT improved vision and reduced macular thickness in eyes with&#xD;
      refractory diabetic macular edema. They showed that this beneficial effect persisted for up&#xD;
      to 2 years with repeated treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We also conducted a randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial to determine the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of IVT for intractable DME. Besides, we tried to evaluate the effect of this&#xD;
      intervention on angiographic findings of these patients.&#xD;
