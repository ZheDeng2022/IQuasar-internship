  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Biosynthesis of proteins is essential for growth and continued maintenance of the entire&#xD;
      neuron including axons, dendrites, and synaptic terminals, and it is clearly one of the&#xD;
      important biochemical processes underlying adaptive changes in the nervous system. Studies in&#xD;
      experimental animals with the quantitative autoradiographic L [1 (14)C]leucine method have&#xD;
      demonstrated a number of the physiological and pathological conditions in which changes in&#xD;
      regional rates of cerebral protein synthesis (rCPS) occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have recently developed the first fully quantitative method for determining rCPS with&#xD;
      positron emission tomography (PET). The PET method was adapted from the autoradiographic L [1&#xD;
      (14)C]leucine method; it uses L [1 (11)C]leucine as the PET tracer, dynamic scanning, and a&#xD;
      kinetic modeling approach for quantification. This method was validated in nonhuman primates&#xD;
      by comparison of PET measurements with those based on established biochemical and&#xD;
      autoradiographic techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the present study is to examine the degree to which changes in rCPS in human&#xD;
      subjects can be quantified with the L [1 (11)C]leucine PET method. We propose three studies&#xD;
      to be carried out sequentially. In Part I we will establish the L-[1-(11)C]leucine PET method&#xD;
      in human subjects. In Part II we will measure rCPS in normal control subjects in two states:&#xD;
      awake and under deep sedation/general anesthesia with propofol. A difference in rCPS between&#xD;
      these two states may indicate that we can detect activity-dependent protein synthesis with&#xD;
      the PET method. In Part III we will study subjects with fragile X syndrome. This patient&#xD;
      group was chosen since the affected gene in fragile X syndrome codes for a protein that is&#xD;
      thought to be a negative regulator of message translation. Thus an effect on protein&#xD;
      synthesis may be very close to the underlying genetic abnormality in fragile X syndrome.&#xD;
      Regionally selective increases in rCPS have been found in studies in a mouse model of this&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study will establish the sensitivity of the L [1 (11)C]leucine PET method to&#xD;
      detect changes in rCPS in human subjects. A quantitative and sensitive method to measure rCPS&#xD;
      with PET will augment the tools available for investigating the brain and its regional&#xD;
      adaptive responses. Ultimately the method may have widespread applications, not only for the&#xD;
      study of normal development and plasticity but also in clinical medicine, e.g., in the&#xD;
      investigation of disorders of brain development, recovery from brain injury, and&#xD;
      neurodegenerative diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC AIMS&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. &lt;TAB&gt;Establish the L-[1-(11)C]leucine PET method for measurement of rCPS in human&#xD;
           subjects. Evaluate the optimal scan time and the variability of the measurement in an&#xD;
           individual.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. &lt;TAB&gt;Determine the effect of deep sedation with propofol on rCPS in normal human&#xD;
           subjects. We will use the [1-(11)C]leucine PET method to evaluate lambda, i.e., the&#xD;
           fraction of the precursor pool for protein synthesis that is derived from arterial&#xD;
           plasma, and rCPS in the same subjects under awake and deep sedation conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
           I)&lt;TAB&gt;Hypothesis 1a. Deep sedation with propofol has effects on rCPS.&#xD;
&#xD;
           II)&lt;TAB&gt;Hypothesis 1b. Deep sedation with propofol has effects on values of lambda.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. &lt;TAB&gt;Assess the sensitivity of the [1-(11)C]leucine PET method to detect differences in&#xD;
           rCPS in subjects with fragile X syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      I)&lt;TAB&gt;Hypothesis 3a. There are regionally selective changes in rCPS in subjects with fragile&#xD;
      X syndrome compared with age-matched healthy controls. Regions affected include hippocampus,&#xD;
      thalamus, hypothalamus, amygdala, and frontal and parietal cortex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II)&lt;TAB&gt;Hypothesis 3b. In centrum semiovale, cerebellum, striatum and occipital and temporal&#xD;
      cortex rCPS are unchanged in subjects with fragile X syndrome compared with age-matched&#xD;
      healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III)&lt;TAB&gt;Hypothesis 3c. Values of lambda in the brain as a whole and in the regions examined&#xD;
      are unchanged in subjects with fragile X syndrome compared with age-matched healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV) Hypothesis 3d. The average rate of protein synthesis in the brain as a whole is unchanged&#xD;
      in subjects with fragile X syndrome compared with age-matched healthy controls.&#xD;
