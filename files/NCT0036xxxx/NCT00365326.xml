  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I clinical trial will evaluate the safety and efficacy of intra-coronary injection&#xD;
      of AC133 selected autologous marrow-derived stem cells in patients with chronic coronary&#xD;
      artery occlusion. A clinical study to determine the therapeutic potential of marrow-derived&#xD;
      stem cells as an adjunct therapy to current standard therapies for CAD is warranted. The&#xD;
      current initiative is to investigate a model of chronic myocardial ischemia and (1) to&#xD;
      determine whether intra-coronary injection of selected autologous marrow-derived AC133 stem&#xD;
      cells is reasonably safe for use in humans and (2) if this treatment shows any improvement in&#xD;
      coronary perfusion, as assessed using non-invasive imaging. This study is structured to&#xD;
      evaluate the feasibility and safety of autologous AC133+ bone marrow-derived stem cell via&#xD;
      intra-coronary injection into documented ischemic but viable myocardial zones via established&#xD;
      collateral vessels. The epicardial vessel that normally supplies the ischemic zone must be&#xD;
      100% chronically occluded and considered non-revascularizable by percutaneous means.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is composed of one phase. The objective of Phase I is to assess the safety and&#xD;
      feasibility of performing escalating doses of autologous AC133+ selected bone marrow-derived&#xD;
      stem cell with intracoronary infusion via epicardial vessels supplying collateral flow to&#xD;
      areas of viable ischemic myocardium in the distribution of a chronic totally occluded vessel.&#xD;
      Additionally, focus on the assessment of the benefit achieved from the infusion of stem cells&#xD;
      and subsequent angiogenesis at 6 months will be observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential candidates are patients with a known total occlusion of an epicardial vessel, with&#xD;
      a documented chronically ischemic territory supplied by collateral conduits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Improvement in ETT as determined by: total exercise duration on the 6 month ETT in&#xD;
           seconds time to: onset of angina, one mm ST depression, onset of angina or one mm ST&#xD;
           depression (whichever occurs first)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Reduction in the area of ischemia will be evaluated by nuclear (sestamibi) stress&#xD;
           imaging with exercise or pharmacologic stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Improvement in viability within the chronically ischemic zone as measured by nuclear&#xD;
           (sestamibi) stress imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Improvement in angina as per Angina Questionnaire (The Seattle Angina Questionnaire) at&#xD;
           7, 14, 30, 90, 180, and 365 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Major adverse cardiac events (MACE) assessment (composite endpoint including cardiac&#xD;
           death, myocardial infarction, ischemia-driven target vessel revascularization, CABG,&#xD;
           CVA, and rehospitalization for angina), MACE definitions:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Myocardial Infarction (All ST segment elevation MIs as diagnosed on electrocardiogram by&#xD;
           a staff cardiologist and all non-ST segment elevation MIs as defined by elevation in&#xD;
           cardiac enzyme markers per the hospital laboratory guidelines) Cerebral Vascular&#xD;
           Accidents (e.g., acute neurological event).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Concomitant Medication usage (e.g., changes in utilization of PRN or sublingual&#xD;
           nitroglycerin for angina)&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. ECG changes at day of discharge, 7, 14, 30, 90, 180, and 365 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Functional capacity (e.g., exercise duration (time) and changes in METS achieved on&#xD;
           treadmill study at 6 month follow-up).&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Echocardiogram assessment of left ventricular ejection fraction and regional wall motion&#xD;
           abnormalities at 180 days (e.g., changes in regional wall motion score and/or changes in&#xD;
           left ventricular ejection fraction).&#xD;
