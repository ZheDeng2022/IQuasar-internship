  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tongue exercises are described to improved snoring and acid reflux symptoms. Acid reflux&#xD;
      treatment has been found to improve obstructive sleep apnea to a limited degree. Upper airway&#xD;
      resistance syndrome is caused by resistance to breathing, leading to multiple respiratory&#xD;
      event related arousals, leading to daytime fatigue and other various physical ailments.&#xD;
      Tongue base or retrolingual collapse is implicated in upper airway resistance syndrome. We&#xD;
      will measure sleep quality and quality of life indices before and after treatment for&#xD;
      subjects that undergo tongue exercises only, acid reflux treatment only, and those that&#xD;
      undergo both treatments.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Upper airway resistance syndrome (UARS) is a distinct clinical disorder characterized by&#xD;
      repetitive arousals during sleep due to soft tissue collapse of the pharynx. It is associated&#xD;
      with chronic daytime fatigue, insomnia, cold extremities, low blood pressure, orthostatic&#xD;
      intolerance, headaches/migraine/TMJ, and various gastrointestinal condition. Obstructive&#xD;
      sleep apnea (OSA) is different in that once obstruction of the pharynx occurs, there are&#xD;
      multiple periods of complete (apnea) or incomplete cessation of breathing (hypopnea).&#xD;
      Untreated, it has been strongly associated with daytime sleepiness, hypertension, depression,&#xD;
      coronary artery disease, stroke, and even death. One possible mechanism of pharyngeal&#xD;
      obstruction is that the posterior tongue is susceptible to collapse when supine during sleep,&#xD;
      which causes further collapse of the soft palate and related structures. Acid reflux is also&#xD;
      known to frequently coexist with UARS and OSA, possibly by increasing upper airway edema and&#xD;
      inflammation. Treating OSA has been shown to improve reflux symptoms, and vice versa. Tongue&#xD;
      exercises are also found to improve snoring and reflux symptoms. This study aims to validate&#xD;
      via pre and post treatment polysomnograms, the effectiveness of tongue exercises alone, acid&#xD;
      reflux treatment alone, or a combination of both regimens. Twenty-five patients will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to each of the three groups. Measurements include the percent improvement&#xD;
      of major sleep indices within each group, as well as between groups. Quality of life&#xD;
      variables as well as acid reflux symptom scores will be addressed as well.&#xD;
