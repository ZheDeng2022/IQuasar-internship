      The primary purpose of this protocol is to compare PDE4 levels before and after starting a&#xD;
      selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) sertraline, citalopram or escitalopram in&#xD;
      unmedicated depressed patients. The secondary purpose is to compare PDE4 levels between&#xD;
      unmedicated depressed patients and healthy subjects.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Although direct pharmacological effects of antidepressant should manifest rapidly, before&#xD;
      significant symptom relief appears, typically antidepressant treatment needs to be continued&#xD;
      for 2 to 4 weeks. This delayed onset of clinical effects indicates involvement of adaptive&#xD;
      changes in antidepressant effects. Rodent studies have consistently shown upregulation of the&#xD;
      3, 5-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) system induced by different types of chronic but&#xD;
      not acute antidepressant treatment including serotonin and norepinephrine uptake inhibitors,&#xD;
      monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, lithium and electroconvulsions. cAMP&#xD;
      is synthesized from adenosine 5-triphosphate (ATP) by adenylyl cyclase and metabolized by&#xD;
      cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs). Type 4 PDE (PDE4) is selective to cAMP in the&#xD;
      brain. Among components of the cAMP pathway, PDE4 appears to be critical for antidepressant&#xD;
      effects because an inhibitor of PDE4, 4-[3-(cyclopenotoxyl)-4-methoxyphenyl]-2-pyrrolidone&#xD;
      (rolipram), showed antidepressant effects both in animals and humans, and various forms of&#xD;
      antidepressant treatment induced increase in PDE4 in rodents. However, without imaging the&#xD;
      cAMP pathway before and after antidepressant treatment in depressives, it is not possible to&#xD;
      study adaptive changes in the signal transduction system and its role in the symptom relief.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently (R)-[(11)C]rolipram has been successfully used to image PDE4 in animals and humans.&#xD;
      We have confirmed that PDE4 levels can be measured reliably by performing (R)-[(11)C]rolipram&#xD;
      positron emission tomography (PET) with multiple arterial sampling even in rats. The primary&#xD;
      purpose of this protocol is to compare PDE4 levels before and after starting a selective&#xD;
      serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) sertraline, citalopram or escitalopram in unmedicated&#xD;
      depressed patients. The secondary purpose is to compare PDE4 levels between unmedicated&#xD;
      depressed patients and healthy subjects. Baseline scans of patients will be used for this&#xD;
      second comparison. For the first time, these comparisons have become possible with the new&#xD;
      PET agent (R)-[(11)C]rolipram. The findings will advance understanding on the role of cAMP&#xD;
      signal transduction system in the pathology of depression and the mechanisms of&#xD;
      antidepressant effects.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Healthy Volunteers (n = 70)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Healthy Control Sample (n = 70): Sixty of these volunteers will have brain PET scans and 10&#xD;
        of these have only blood sampling to compare (R)-[(11)C]rolipram levels in artery and vein.&#xD;
        Healthy subjects (ages 18-55) will be selected who have not met criteria for any major&#xD;
        psychiatric disorder, have no known first-degree relatives with mood disorders, and have a&#xD;
        current score on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS; 17 item) (Williams 1988) in&#xD;
        the not depressed range (less than or equal to 7). Control subjects will be matched to&#xD;
        depressed subjects for age and gender. Forty of these subjects will have&#xD;
        (R)-[(11)C]rolipram PET scans with blood sampling and 10 subjects have only blood sampling&#xD;
        without PET scan. The healthy volunteers who are used to measure the difference in&#xD;
        (R)-[(11)C]rolipram concentration between the artery and the vein will not undergo&#xD;
        psychiatric assessment because the data will not be compared with those of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        MDD Samples (n = 65)&#xD;
&#xD;
        MDD Sample-Currently Depressed (n = 65): Patients (ages 18-55) will be selected with&#xD;
        primary MDD currently depressed by DSM-IV criteria for recurrent MDD and current 17-item&#xD;
        HDRS score greater than or equal to 18 or Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)&#xD;
        (Noble et al 1991) greater than or equal to 20 indicating the moderately-to-severely&#xD;
        depressed symptoms. All subjects must be physically healthy and aged 18 55 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects will be recruited who are drug-na(SqrRoot) ve or who have not received&#xD;
        psychotropic drugs for at least 2 weeks (6 weeks for fluoxetine) prior to scanning.&#xD;
        Effective medications will not be discontinued for the purposes of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects will also be excluded if they have:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. serious suicidal ideation or behavior&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. psychosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. medical conditions or concomitant medications that are likely to influence PET&#xD;
             measurement or have significant interactions with sertraline, citalopram or&#xD;
             escitalopram.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. a history of drug or alcohol abuse within 1 year or a lifetime history of alcohol or&#xD;
             drug dependence (DSM-IV criteria)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. positive urine drug screen&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. current pregnancy (as documented by pregnancy testing prior to scanning)&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. general MRI exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. major depression that arose following another major medical or psychiatric condition,&#xD;
             and&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. prior participation in other research protocols within a year such that radiation&#xD;
             exposure would exceed the annual guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
        For patients who have two [C-11]rolipram PET scans, one before and another after SSRI&#xD;
        treatment, previous failures of or intolerance to SSRI may not allow for treatment in the&#xD;
        current protocol. In clinical practice, medication can be switched between sertraline and&#xD;
        citalopram/escitalopram because sertraline and citalopram/escitalopram have somewhat&#xD;
        different therapeutic effects and adverse reactions. Along these lines, we will consider&#xD;
        citalopram and its enantiomer escitalopram as being equivalent to each other. Patients will&#xD;
        therefore be excluded from the study with two [C-11]rolipram PET scans if they previously&#xD;
        failed to respond to adequate treatment trials of all medications available for use in the&#xD;
        study, or if they have a history of being unable to tolerate all of the study medications.&#xD;
        Specifically, patients will be excluded from the study with two [C-11]rolipram PET scans if&#xD;
        they:&#xD;
&#xD;
        j) previously proved unresponsive to therapeutic trials of both sertraline and&#xD;
        citalopram/escitalopram.&#xD;
&#xD;
        k) previously developed allergic reactions to both sertraline and citalopram/escitalopram,&#xD;
        or discontinued both sertraline and citalopram/escitalopram due to an adverse effect&#xD;
&#xD;
        l) through any combination of therapeutic unresponsiveness and adverse medication effects,&#xD;
        are unsuitable for treatment with both sertraline and citalopram/escitalopram&#xD;
&#xD;
        m) prolonged QTc in ECG&#xD;
&#xD;
        Please note that the exclusion criteria j, k, and l do not apply to patients who have one&#xD;
        [C-11]rolipram PET without having antidepressant treatment in this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Additional exclusion criteria applied to control subjects are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        n) subjects with a current or past history of other axis I psychiatric conditions&#xD;
&#xD;
        o) subjects with first-degree family members with current or past history of mood disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Please note that these exclusion criteria (with the exception of f and i) do not apply to&#xD;
        the healthy volunteers who are used to measure the difference in (R)-[(11)C]rolipram&#xD;
        concentration between the artery and the vein, without PET scanning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects beyond age 55 are excluded to reduce the biological heterogeneity encompassed by&#xD;
        the MDD criteria, and to reduce the variability of PET data.&#xD;
