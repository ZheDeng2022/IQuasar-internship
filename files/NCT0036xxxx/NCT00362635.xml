&#xD;
          2. Patient is HBV DNA positive with DNA levels at screening &gt;= 3 x 1,000,000 copies/mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient is documented to be HBsAg positive for &gt; 6 months and HBeAg positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patient has AST and ALT levels which are &gt;= 1 times and &lt;= 10 times the upper limit of&#xD;
             normal (x ULN).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patient has bilirubin levels &lt;= 1.5 x ULN or bilirubin levels &gt; 1.5 x ULN with&#xD;
             diagnosis of Gilbert's disease and conjugated bilirubin within normal limits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Women of childbearing age must have a negative urine (b-HCG) pregnancy test before&#xD;
             start of trial treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patient is able to give written informed consent prior to study start and to comply&#xD;
             with the study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient is currently receiving antiviral, immunomodulatory or corticosteroid therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients previously treated with lamivudine, lobucavir, adefovir, famciclovir, or any&#xD;
             other investigational nucleoside for HBV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Previous treatment with interferon must have ended at least 6 months prior to the&#xD;
             screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patient has a history of ascites, variceal hemorrhage or hepatic encephalopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patient is co-infected with HCV or HIV.&#xD;

          6. Patient has evidence of decompensated cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma (alpha&#xD;
             fetoprotein).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patient is pregnant or breast-feeding.&#xD;
