      The present study will use a new type of respirator in premature babies who need help with&#xD;
      their breathing. This new respirator uses signals from the baby's diaphragm - the most&#xD;
      important breathing muscle - to control the timing and the amount of air that the baby needs.&#xD;
      The goal of the study is to demonstrate that this new respirator can synchronize delivery of&#xD;
      air to the baby's efforts, and that synchrony is maintained regardless of whether the baby is&#xD;
      breathing with a tube or a mask.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is an abundance of evidence in the literature suggesting that maintenance of&#xD;
      spontaneous breathing with a synchronized mode of ventilatory assist, and the use of&#xD;
      non-invasive interface to deliver the assist, has the potential to significantly improve&#xD;
      neonatal respiratory care. Conventional modes of mechanical ventilation use pneumatic signals&#xD;
      such as airway pressure, flow, or volume, which are dampened by respiratory muscle weakness,&#xD;
      increased load (impaired respiratory mechanics), and leaks. In order to improve patient&#xD;
      ventilator synchrony, further development over current technology is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study deals with the implementation and clinical evaluation of neural control of&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation in the neonatal intensive care unit. The goal is to demonstrate, in&#xD;
      pre-term newborns with extremely low birth weight, that neural control of mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation, using the electrical activity of the diaphragm (EAdi), can synchronize delivery&#xD;
      of assist to the patient's inspiratory drive, and that synchrony is maintained regardless of&#xD;
      the interface used. This proposal will introduce for the first time technology for neural&#xD;
      triggering and cycling-off as well as neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA) in the&#xD;
      treatment of pre-term infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Project 1, the aim is to demonstrate that neural triggering and cycling-off (i.e.&#xD;
      initiation and termination of ventilatory assist using EAdi) improve infant-ventilator&#xD;
      synchrony, compared to conventional pneumatic trigger systems in pre-term infants with&#xD;
      extremely low birth weight. It is hypothesized that neural triggering and cycling-off of&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation improves infant-ventilator synchrony. This will be evaluated by&#xD;
      comparing the infant's neural timings (inspiratory and expiratory) to ventilator timings,&#xD;
      during conventional pressure support ventilation and during neural triggering and&#xD;
      cycling-off. We expect that patient-ventilator synchrony will be improved in the neural mode,&#xD;
      and that comfort will be lowest with increased asynchrony (conventional modes) and highest&#xD;
      with improved infant-ventilator synchrony (neural triggering and cycling-off).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Project 2, the aim is to demonstrate that administration of NAVA with invasive&#xD;
      (endotracheal intubation) or non-invasive interface (nasal prongs) is equally efficient in&#xD;
      terms of triggering and cycling-off. The hypothesis is that with NAVA, non-invasive&#xD;
      ventilation with nasal prong is equally efficient as invasive ventilation. In premature&#xD;
      infants deemed ready for extubation, NAVA will be implemented prior to and post-extubation&#xD;
      (with single nasal prong). We anticipate that ventilatory assist will be delivered with full&#xD;
      synchrony regardless of invasive or non-invasive delivery of assist, and that there should be&#xD;
      no difference in the delays between the onset of EAdi and ventilatory assist and in the&#xD;
      delays between peak of EAdi and cycling-off. We also expect that due to less airway&#xD;
      resistance during non-invasive ventilation, peak applied pressures and diaphragm activation&#xD;
      levels will be lower.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By improving patient-ventilator interaction and allowing use of a non-invasive&#xD;
      patient-ventilator interface, neural control of mechanical ventilators has the potential to&#xD;
      significantly reduce ventilator-related complications, reduce the incidence of lung injury,&#xD;
      facilitate weaning from mechanical ventilation, and decrease the duration of stay in the&#xD;
      intensive care unit and overall hospitalization. These issues can be addressed in future&#xD;
      randomized clinical trials in the case that the present short-term work has a positive&#xD;
      outcome.&#xD;
