  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate whether intestinal permeability and/or serum&#xD;
      zonulin concentration is increased in children/adolescents with functional dyspepsia (FD).&#xD;
      The study will also explore the relationships between intestinal permeability, mucosal&#xD;
      inflammation and anxiety in FD patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Recurrent abdominal pain is a common complaint among school-age children, being present in up&#xD;
      to 15% at any given time. It represents the most common chronic pain entity in pediatric&#xD;
      patients. The great majority of these patients will have a functional gastrointestinal&#xD;
      disorder (FGID). The most common FGID in these patients is functional dyspepsia (FD), defined&#xD;
      as upper abdominal pain or discomfort unrelieved by bowel movement and in the absence of a&#xD;
      structural or biochemical explanation for the pain. The etiology of FD is multifactorial,&#xD;
      including biological factors, and these factors can be viewed within a biopsychosocial model.&#xD;
      Biological factors include inflammation, dysmotility and increased visceral sensitivity.&#xD;
      These biological factors are influenced by and are interactive with psychosocial factors such&#xD;
      as anxiety, depression and social interaction. This study will evaluate intestinal&#xD;
      permeability as a measure of barrier dysfunction and investigate the correlations between&#xD;
      increased permeability, mucosal inflammation and anxiety scores to provide further insight&#xD;
      into the etiology of FD, thereby assisting in the development and selection of treatment&#xD;
      modalities.&#xD;
