  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many patients who already harbor drug-resistant HIV require interruption of HAART due to poor&#xD;
      compliance, poor quality of life, toxicity or development of resistance. In these patients&#xD;
      interruption of HAART has a negative impact on patient immune status due to the reemergence&#xD;
      of wild-type virus which is in general more pathogenic than HIV isolates containing&#xD;
      resistance mutations. There is a need for &quot;bridging&quot; antiretroviral regimens that might&#xD;
      prolong time off conventional HAART whilst waiting for a new regimen that is either fully&#xD;
      suppressive or less toxic or less demanding for the patient.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Virological failure associated with the appearance of resistant mutations is still common in&#xD;
      patients receiving HAART. When HAART fails patients and clinicians can chose from three&#xD;
      different courses of action:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Switch therapy to a new salvage regimen based on the results of resistance testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Success of the new salvage regimen is maximized if the new regimen includes&#xD;
           antiretroviral drugs without cross-resistance with previous failed drugs or,&#xD;
           preferably,new classes of drugs. In general, rescue regimens are more complicated for&#xD;
           patients due to its higher pill burden; more frequent dosing and sometimes need for&#xD;
           parenteral therapy (Enfuvirtide).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Stop therapy. This strategy is feasible in patient with relatively preserved immune&#xD;
           function. Time off antiretroviral therapy would be highly dependent on previous nadir&#xD;
           CD4 cell count (the lowest the nadir, the more rapidly patients loses CD4 cells). In&#xD;
           patients with multidrug resistant virus this strategy is used with the goal of achieving&#xD;
           virus reversion towards wild-type forms. Reversion towards wild-type virus would&#xD;
           theoretically &quot;resensitize&quot; HIV to prior failed drugs. Unfortunately, a number of&#xD;
           investigations have suggested that the loss of CD4 cell count occurred during the time&#xD;
           off therapy might not be regained after starting rescue therapy. In addition, reversion&#xD;
           towards wild type virus does not appear to be associated with a more favourable outcome&#xD;
           of rescue therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Maintain failing therapy. This strategy has the potential advantage of decreasing the&#xD;
           rate of CD4 cell loss. It is known that certain mutations of HIV decrease viral fitness&#xD;
           and produce a less pathogenic virus. Consequently, compared to wild-type virus, CD4&#xD;
           destruction is decreased in the presence of resistance mutations. The very important&#xD;
           risk inherent to this strategy is the accumulation of new antiretroviral mutations if&#xD;
           the regimen is maintained. Due to cross-resistance among antiretroviral drugs,&#xD;
           accumulation of new mutations decreases the chances of success of a new salvage regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Choosing among these three different strategies depends on a number of important factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Availability of antiretroviral drugs active against resistant HIV isolates. Clinicians&#xD;
           would be more prone to switch to a new salvage regimen if the new regimen contains a new&#xD;
           class of drugs and/or at least three drugs without cross resistance with the&#xD;
           antiretroviral included in the failing regimen. This scenario is very likely after first&#xD;
           or second regimen failure. However, after third regimen failure the possibilities of&#xD;
           including at least three active drugs dramatically decrease. For deep salvage the&#xD;
           possibilities of constructing a viable rescue regimen often depends on enrolling the&#xD;
           patient in a clinical trial of a new antiretroviral (for example CCR5 inhibitors).&#xD;
           Enrolment in the trial very often implies that patients have to wait for an undefined&#xD;
           period of time until the trial starts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Willingness of patient to switch to a more complicated regimen. After second regimen&#xD;
           failure, rescue therapies involve a higher pill burden, more frequent dosing and, in a&#xD;
           substantial number of cases, the need of parenteral therapy with enfuvirtide. In this&#xD;
           situation it is possible that the patient prefer not to start the new therapy due to the&#xD;
           negative impact of the new regimen in his quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Immune status of the patient. In patients with low CD4 cell count stopping therapy can&#xD;
           put the patient at risk of developing an opportunistic disease. In general patients and&#xD;
           clinicians are reluctant to stop therapy if the current CD4 cell count is below 200-250&#xD;
           cells/mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Apart from the setting of virological failure HAART interruption might be needed in patients&#xD;
      with well controlled viral replication (HIV viremia persistently below 50 copies/ mL).&#xD;
      Possible reasons for HAART interruption in this scenario are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Toxicity of current regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patient desire (for example travel abroad).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Poor quality of life related to treatment issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Poor adherence to current HAART regimen and an impending risk of developing resistance&#xD;
           mutations. When a patient stop HAART due to these reasons, wild-type HIV re-emerges with&#xD;
           the consequent loss of CD4 cells. Depending on the immune status of the patient and&#xD;
           prior CD4 cell nadir time off therapy might be quite limited.&#xD;
