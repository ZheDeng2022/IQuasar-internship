    <textblock>
      The precursor study (SCA101469) was an open-label, prospective multicentre study in adult&#xD;
      subjects diagnosed with bipolar disorder consisting of 36 weeks treatment with lamotrigine.&#xD;
      The current study is to provide 12 months post study access to open-label lamotrigine for&#xD;
      participants of the SCA101469 study.&#xD;

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that occurred during the course of the trial after study treatment had started. An adverse event is therefore any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug. An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, are life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization or results in disability/incapacity, and congenital anomaly/birth defect. Only SAEs were recorded and reported in this extension study.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A subject will be eligible for inclusion in this study only if all of the following&#xD;
        criteria apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  completed 32 weeks of open label treatment in study SCA101469 and, in the&#xD;
             investigators opinion, has responded to lamotrigine therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  male or female subject&#xD;
&#xD;
        A female is eligible to enter and participate in this study if she is of:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. non-childbearing potential (i.e., physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant,&#xD;
             including any female who is post-menopausal or sterilised) or,&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. child-bearing potential, has a negative urine pregnancy test at screening, and agrees&#xD;
             to one of the following contraceptive methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Complete abstinence from intercourse from 2 weeks prior to administration of the&#xD;
                  study drug, throughout the study, and for a time interval after completion of&#xD;
                  premature discontinuation from the study to account for elimination of the&#xD;
                  investigational drug (a minimum of 5 half-lives or longer if the pharmacodynamic&#xD;
                  profile of the investigational drug warrants a longer time period); or,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Sterilisation of male partner; or,&#xD;

                  criterion); or,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Any other methods with published data showing that the lowest expected failure&#xD;
                  rate for that method is less than 1% per year; or,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Barrier method only if used in combination with any of the above acceptable&#xD;
                  methods.&#xD;
