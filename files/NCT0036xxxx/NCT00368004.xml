  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will identify the genes responsible for uveal coloboma, an abnormal development of&#xD;
      the eye caused by incomplete closure of a normally-occurring gap in the eye (the optic&#xD;
      fissure) after the fifth week of life in a human embryo. There have been studies of families&#xD;
      in which more than one person has been affected by this disorder. Coloboma occurs in about 1&#xD;
      of 10,000 live births and may cause significant vision loss. Researchers seek a better&#xD;
      understanding of the genes responsible for this disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults and children who have more than one member of the family with uveal coloboma may be&#xD;
      eligible for this study. Patients will undergo a detailed medical history and eye examination&#xD;
      appropriate for their age. The pupils will be dilated, through the use of eye drops. Dilation&#xD;
      will continue for 4 to 6 hours, and wearing of sunglasses can reduce temporary glare that&#xD;
      many patients may experience in brightly lit areas. In addition, pictures will be taken of&#xD;
      the front or back of the eye, a procedure that also involves dilation of the pupils. Patients&#xD;
      who have coloboma will undergo a complete physical examination. Blood samples will be&#xD;
      collected, with a total of about 2 tablespoons from patients ages 10 and older and about 1&#xD;
      teaspoon for each 5 pounds of body weight for younger patients. Also, patients with coloboma&#xD;
      may be asked to undergo X-rays , ultrasound, or other tests that are medically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To have enough DNA to study, the researchers may create a cell line to grow more DNA.&#xD;
      Laboratory samples will be coded so that there is no identifying information about&#xD;
      participants in this study. No other testing or research will be done on blood samples&#xD;
      collected unless patients give permission. The researchers will not provide information about&#xD;
      patients' health to other people without your express permission.&#xD;

      Objective: To describe phenotypes and find genes causing a developmental and potentially&#xD;
      blinding eye condition, uveal coloboma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Families where more than one family member has uveal coloboma. Both&#xD;
      affected and genetically informative, unaffected members of the family will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Observational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: Clinical examination, genetic mapping and mutation identification.&#xD;

        -  This study will enroll 120 adult and children members of families where more than one&#xD;
             individual is reported to have coloboma. Affected and unaffected family members will&#xD;
             be both enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The participant must have any recognizeable form of inherited coloboma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The participant must be a genetically informative member of a family where more than&#xD;
             one person is affected by typical uveal coloboma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The participant must be able to comply with the protocol and provide a blood sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The participant has any syndromic form of coloboma likely due to mutations in a known&#xD;
        gene.&#xD;
