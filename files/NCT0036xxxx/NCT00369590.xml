  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well VEGF Trap works in treating patients with recurrent&#xD;
      malignant or anaplastic gliomas that did not respond to temozolomide. VEGF Trap may stop the&#xD;
      growth of malignant or anaplastic gliomas by blocking blood flow to the tumor.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the therapeutic efficacy of VEGF Trap in patients with temozolomide-resistant&#xD;
      malignant gliomas at first recurrence as measured by 6-month progression-free survival (PFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the safety profile of VEGF Trap in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the efficacy of this regimen as measured by radiographic response, PFS, time to&#xD;
      progression, and overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Characterize the single-dose and repeated-dose pharmacokinetic profiles of VEGF Trap in&#xD;
      these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to histology&#xD;
      (glioblastoma vs anaplastic glioma).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive VEGF Trap IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every 14 days in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.&#xD;
