  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals who are not physically active are at risk for developing heart disease, stroke,&#xD;
      and diabetes. Using motivational print materials is one way to encourage individuals to&#xD;
      increase their physical activity. This study will evaluate the effect that an enhanced&#xD;
      version of an individualized, print-based motivational program has on increasing physical&#xD;
      activity among sedentary individuals.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, only 32% of adults in the United States participate in regular physical activity.&#xD;
      Several healthcare organizations, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,&#xD;
      the National Institutes of Health, and the American Heart Association recommend that adults&#xD;
      engage in a minimum of 2 ½ hours of physical activity each week. In a previous study,&#xD;
      individuals who received motivational print materials in the mail increased their weekly&#xD;
      physical activity more than individuals who received no motivational materials or who&#xD;
      received motivational support over the telephone. However, about half of those who were&#xD;
      mailed the print materials still did not reach the recommended goal of 2 ½ hours of physical&#xD;
      activity per week. The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of an enhanced&#xD;
      version of an individualized, print-based motivational program versus a previously tested&#xD;
      print-based motivational program at increasing physical activity levels in sedentary&#xD;
      individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll healthy, sedentary individuals. Participants will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      to either a print-based, individually tailored motivational program or an enhanced version of&#xD;
      the same program. All participants will attend a baseline study visit, which will include&#xD;
      body measurements, physical activity assessments, and health and psychological&#xD;
      questionnaires. A select group of participants will also take part in an exercise test.&#xD;
      Participants will then document their monthly physical activity. Study researchers will use&#xD;
      this information, as well as the completed questionnaires, to develop individualized reports,&#xD;
      manuals, and tip sheets that include feedback and strategies for increasing physical activity&#xD;
      for each participant. Materials will be mailed to participants 14 times throughout the year.&#xD;
      Participants in the enhanced intervention will receive additional materials that focus on&#xD;
      increasing social support, self regulation, and outcome expectations, as well as materials on&#xD;
      how to effectively monitor physical activity levels. They will also attend one study visit to&#xD;
      assess their goals with the research staff. At Months 6 and 12, baseline evaluations will be&#xD;
      repeated and all participants will be interviewed to assess physical activity levels.&#xD;
