  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the rate of response with the combination of&#xD;
      erlotinib and bevacizumab in previously treated patients with thymoma or thymic carcinoma,&#xD;
      and to determine potential molecular markers that may predict response to therapy in patients&#xD;
      with thymoma or thymic carcinoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We believe that both the EGFR pathway, as well as tumor angiogenesis play an important role&#xD;
      in the pathogenesis of thymic neoplasms. Our previous experience with the EGFR inhibitor&#xD;
      gefitinib showed a promising, though limited activity in this disease. We hypothesize that&#xD;
      combining the novel EGFR inhibitor erlotinib with bevacizumab will have a synergistic effect&#xD;
      on this tumor. We have selected the 15mg/kg q21 days of bevacizumab based on the data&#xD;
      published by Johnson DH et al, in which 99 patients were randomly assigned to bevacizumab 7.5&#xD;
      (n = 32) or 15 mg/kg (n = 35) plus carboplatin (area under the curve = 6) and paclitaxel (200&#xD;
      mg/m2) every 3 weeks or carboplatin and paclitaxel alone (n = 32). The highest response noted&#xD;
      in the high-dose group (31.5%) and 28.1% in the lower dose bevacizumab arm. There was also a&#xD;
      trend to improved TTP and OS in the high dose arm, although the study lacked sufficient power&#xD;
      to make any definitive conclusions regarding a possible relationship between dose and&#xD;
      treatment effect. (105) The safety and efficacy of this dose and schedule was confirmed by&#xD;
      E4599 (43). Herbst et al have confirmed the safety of the combination of erlotinib 150 mg/day&#xD;
      orally plus bevacizumab 15 mg/kg in a published phase I/II trial (74)&#xD;
&#xD;
      This regimen has the potential to provide a new, effective therapy for this malignancy, as&#xD;
      well as teaching us important lessons about the biology of the disease. To this end, we would&#xD;
      also measure surrogate markers of angiogenesis, such as tumor VEGF expression, serum VCAM-1&#xD;
      and bFGF, as well as urine VEGF. We would also determine tumor expression of phosphorylated&#xD;
      EGFR, and analyze the effect of known variant polymorphisms in the VEGF gene on outcomes. We&#xD;
      will test tumor samples for expression of EGFR by IHC and FISH to correlate to response.&#xD;
