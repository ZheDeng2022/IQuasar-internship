  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II study designed to evaluate whether the co-administration of a fixed dose&#xD;
      of tesmilifene and a standard regimen of docetaxel alters the plasma pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      docetaxel. This study will also assess the safety and efficacy of the tesmilifene/docetaxel&#xD;
      combination in metastatic breast cancer patients.&#xD;

      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To evaluate whether the co-administration of a fixed dose of tesmilifene (5.3 mg/kg) with&#xD;
      a standard dose of docetaxel (100 mg/m2) alters the plasma pharmacokinetics of docetaxel&#xD;
      compared to the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel when given alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To correlate plasma tesmilifene levels during and following the infusion with the acute&#xD;
           tesmilifene-related adverse events observed during and after the infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To collect safety information for tesmilifene when administered in combination with&#xD;
           docetaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate response rate, duration of response and overall survival in metastatic&#xD;
           breast cancer patients receiving docetaxel plus tesmilifene.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with documented histological/cytological proof of metastatic and/or recurrent&#xD;
             breast cancer suitable for treatment with docetaxel&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients must have documented hormone receptor status (ER/PR) and Her-2 neu status&#xD;
             determined either by Immunohistochemistry or FISH, within 21 days of randomisation, if&#xD;
             possible, otherwise receptor status from patient history can be used, if determined&#xD;
             from earlier biopsy/surgery. Patients may be randomised whilst results of hormone&#xD;
             receptor status (ER/PR) and Her-2 neu status are pending from the laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Radiological investigations must be conducted within 21 days prior to randomization.&#xD;
             Exceptions will be made only for patients who have had NEGATIVE examinations with 35&#xD;
             days prior to randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Presence of at least one uni-dimensional measurable lesion. 5. Disease free interval&#xD;
             (DFI) less than or equal to 24 months (from the time of initial surgery to&#xD;
             randomization date).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Previous hormone therapy, chemotherapy and radiation therapy allowed as defined in the&#xD;
        protocol 7. Patients with an ECOG status of 0, 1 or 2. 8. Have a life expectancy of at&#xD;
        least 6 months 9. Patients must be female and aged ≥ 18 years and ≤ 65 years 10. Patients&#xD;
        must be willing and able to follow instructions and make all required study visits.&#xD;

        12. Patients must have adequate organ and marrow function as defined in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        13. All women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum or urine&#xD;
        pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity of 25 IU/L of BHCG) within 72 hours prior to&#xD;
        randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        14. Patients must have a negative blood tests for HIV and Hepatitis B and C within 4 weeks&#xD;
