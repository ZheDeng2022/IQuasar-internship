    <textblock>
      Insulin resistance and hyperglycemia contribute to negative outcomes in burned patients. We&#xD;
      will assess insulin sensitivity in traditional terms of glucose metabolism, and with regard&#xD;
      to the responsiveness of both muscle and liver protein metabolism, in severely burned&#xD;
      patients. Plasma free fatty acid (FFA) and tissue TG levels will be manipulated via&#xD;
      inhibition of peripheral lipolysis with nicotinic acid or activation of plasma lipoprotein&#xD;
      lipase activity with heparin, stimulation of tissue fatty acid oxidation and thus reduction&#xD;
      of tissue TG with the peroxisome proliferate-activated receptor (PPAR) alpha agonist&#xD;
      fenofibrate. Methodological approaches will include stable isotope tracer techniques to&#xD;
      quantify kinetic responses of protein, glucose and lipid metabolism in vivo, quantification&#xD;
      of intracellular stores of TG and glycogen by means of magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS),&#xD;
      as well as quantitative analysis of tissue levels of active products of fatty acids, key&#xD;
      intermediates of the insulin signaling pathway, glycogen, the enzyme activities of citrate&#xD;
      synthase and glycogen synthase and the activity of the muscle mitochondria. These studies&#xD;
      will clarify the physiological and clinical significance of the alterations of tissue lipid&#xD;
      metabolism that occur after burn injury, thereby forming the basis for new therapeutic&#xD;
      approaches not only in this specific clinical condition but in other clinical circumstances&#xD;
      in which hepatic and/or muscle TG is elevated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will investigate the general hypothesis that the accumulation of intracellular TG in liver&#xD;
      and muscle either directly causes insulin resistance in those tissues or serves as an&#xD;
      indictor of the intracellular accumulation of active fatty acid products, such as fatty acyl&#xD;
      CoA and diacylglycerol, which in turn disrupt insulin action.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following specific hypotheses will be investigated:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Intracellular TG is elevated in both muscle and liver in severely burned patients. The&#xD;
           reduction of the fat in the liver and the insulin resistance will improve clinical&#xD;
           outcomes, glucose and protein metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The insulin signaling pathway, as reflected by phosphoinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) and PKC&#xD;
           activity, is impaired in tissues with elevated TG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Fatty acids, or their active intracellular products, are the direct inhibitors of&#xD;
           insulin action, rather than the tissue TG itself.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      We will study patients with severe burns, defined as 2nd or 3rd degree burn covering &gt;40% of&#xD;
      total body surface area (TBSA). We propose to study burned children from Shriners Burns&#xD;
      Hospital. The Shriners census is such that approximately 50 children with severe burns are&#xD;
      treated every year. We will study patients immediately prior to their third surgical&#xD;
      procedure, approximately 12-15 days after injury. One half of the patients will be given&#xD;
      fenofibrate (5 mg/kg/day) daily delivered through feeding tube from the time of consent&#xD;
      following admission until 12-14 days post-burn. This length of time after injury will ensure&#xD;
      that untreated patients will have a large accumulation of hepatic TG. Because the &quot;control&quot;&#xD;
      group of patients will have elevated liver TGs, the &quot;experimental&quot; group will have their&#xD;
      hepatic TGs lowered by fenofibrate. By studying the patients the day before the operations,&#xD;
      it will be possible to remove the staples used in skin grafting without risk of loss of&#xD;
      adhesion of the graph, thereby ensuring safety in the MRS. Femoral line inserted for the&#xD;
      surgery can also be utilized, and all patient generally receive a full transfusion during&#xD;
      surgeries, minimizing any study related blood loss. In addition to the liver, we will study&#xD;
      the muscle in burn patients. Patients will be studied during brief fasted state. The will be&#xD;
      fasted four hours prior to the study and then through out the study. Their TPN will be&#xD;
      immediately reconnected following the study. The surgical team at the Shrine places 3Fr, 8 cm&#xD;
      polyethylene catheters (Cook, Inc., Bloomington, IN) into the femoral vein and femoral artery&#xD;
      under local anesthesia the day before surgery. Both femoral catheters will be used for blood&#xD;
      sampling, while the femoral arterial catheter will also used for indocyanine green infusion&#xD;
      for the determination of leg blood flow. Systemic concentration of indocyanine green will be&#xD;
      measured from a central vein, as standard procedure has a multi-lumen subclavian line in all&#xD;
      patients. Patency of all catheters is maintained by saline infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be infused with stable (non-radioactive) isotope tracers of glucose,&#xD;
      phenylalanine and palmitate for up to 8 hours. After 4 hours, without interruption of the&#xD;
      tracer infusion, an infusion of insulin will be started and maintained at the rate of 1.5&#xD;
      mU/kg•min for the final 4 h. Blood glucose concentrations will be measured throughout the&#xD;
      insulin infusion and glucose infused as necessary to maintain the basal plasma glucose&#xD;
      concentration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A biopsy of the quadriceps will be obtained with a Bergstrom needle at the beginning of the&#xD;
      study, 4 h (immediately before the insulin infusion) and at the end of the 4 h insulin&#xD;
      infusion. We will use the A-V balance technique to address the relation between tissue fatty&#xD;
      acid and TG metabolism and the insulin responsiveness of glucose uptake and myofibrillar and&#xD;
      mitochondrial protein synthesis and net protein balance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      b. Subjects Patients are admitted to the burn unit within 48 h of injury. Fluid resuscitation&#xD;
      is provided as previously described (94). Within 48 h of admission, the burn wound is excised&#xD;
      and subsequently grafted by autograft or cadaveric allograft. Patients typically return to&#xD;
      the operating room for reharvesting of donor sites every five to seven days. The experiments&#xD;
      proposed here will be performed the day prior to the third surgery at day 12-15, as femoral&#xD;
      catheters are normally inserted at the time for access during surgery. Enteral feeding with&#xD;
      Vivonex TEN (Sandoz Nutrition Corp, Minneapolis, MN) is started within 24h of admission and&#xD;
      continued until the patient is capable of food by mouth. All patients will be eligible for&#xD;
      the study unless one of the exclusion criterion listed below apply.&#xD;
&#xD;
      c. Procedures From day 1 to day 22 patients will be maintained on enteral feeding of a high&#xD;
      carbohydrate/amino acid mixture (Vivonex, Novartis, Minneapolis, MN). Vivonex contains 300&#xD;
      kcal/serving in the following caloric breakdown: 82.3% carbohydrate, 15% protein, 2.7% fat&#xD;
      (linoleic acid). Patients will be given 25 kcal/kg of Vivonex plus an additional 45 kcal/kg&#xD;
      for each percentage point of total body surface area burned. One half of the patients will be&#xD;
      given fenofibrate (5 mg/kg/day - maximum daily dose) from the time of the first tracer study&#xD;
      until the time of the second tracer study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tracer study subjects can commence once catheters in the femoral artery and vein have&#xD;
      been placed by the surgical team, if necessary, since the majority of patients wil have&#xD;
      pre-existing lines placed for clinical reasons. The catheters will be used for sampling and&#xD;
      in a peripheral vein for infusing, as in our previous studies (e.g., 4). Enteral&#xD;
      administration of a mixture of carbohydrate and amino acids (Vivonex) will be stopped four&#xD;
      hours prior to the study, and will be started immediately following the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day after the tracer infusion the amount of liver and muscle TG and liver glycogen&#xD;
      will be determined by MRS. After metal staples are removed, patients will be transported to&#xD;
      the clinical MRS facilities at UTMB Dept. of Radiology, where measurements will be performed&#xD;
      (see below for details), After obtaining baseline samples, tracer infusions will be started&#xD;
      as described in Figure 2. Half the patients with high tissue TG will be given nicotinic acid&#xD;
      (500 mg orally) at the start of period 2 to lower FFA levels acutely. In the group given&#xD;
      fenofibrate (200 mg/d) or propranolol 0.5mg/kg every 6 hours to lower FFA, half will be&#xD;
      infused with heparin (0.5 U/kg•min, 2.8 U/ kg prime IV) at a dose sufficient to activate&#xD;
      lipoprotein lipase, thereby elevating plasma FFA, while not affecting blood coagulation.&#xD;
      After baseline blood samples from the femoral artery, femoral vein, and peripheral vein are&#xD;
      collected, an 8 hour continuous infusion of primed-constant infusions of 6,6-d2-glucose (0.08&#xD;
      mg/kg•min, prime = 6.8 mg/kg) and d5-phenylalanine (0.20 µmol/kg•min, prime = 8.0 µmol/kg)&#xD;
      will be given in order to quantify hepatic glucose production and protein synthetic rates,&#xD;
      respectively. In addition, 2 hours into the protocol, U-13C16-palmitate (0.16 µmol/kg per&#xD;
      minute) will be started with NaH13CO3 prime (150 µmol/kg) in order to quantify hepatic fatty&#xD;
      acid uptake and oxidation. These tracer infusions will also be maintained throughout the 8&#xD;
      hour tracer study. Blood samples (2- 12 ml) will be taken from the artery, femoral vein and&#xD;
      peripheral vein simultaneously at 120, 180, 210, 225 and 240 minutes (see Appendix 2 for full&#xD;
      timeline). Muscle tissue biopsies will be obtained at the start of period 1, and at 4 hours&#xD;
      of period 1 to measure protein kinetics and also determine biochemical parameters. Then,&#xD;
      period 2 will start. At the start of period 2, a primed, constant infusion of&#xD;
      15N-phenylalanine will be started and maintained throughout period 2. The different tracer of&#xD;
      phenylalanine will be used to quantify the plasma protein synthetic rates using the same&#xD;
      tracer protocol as in period 1. We have previously shown that the two phenylalanine tracers&#xD;
      yield the same results (70). The tracer technique will enable us to measure the primary&#xD;
      endpoints of insulin responsiveness of the liver, i.e., endogenous glucose production and&#xD;
      synthetic rates of albumin and fibrinogen. At 4 hours, hyperinsulinemia will be initiated by&#xD;
      the infusion of insulin at the rate of 1.5 mu/kg•min, which will result in circulating levels&#xD;
      of approximately 200 uU/ml (5). This rate of infusion was based on our previous experience&#xD;
      with insulin infusion in burned patients (e.g., 1-5). We anticipate a considerable variation&#xD;
      in the baseline insulin concentrations, such that if a low rate of infusion were to be used,&#xD;
      the resulting &quot;hyperinsulinemia&quot; in some patients would likely be below the baseline&#xD;
      concentration in others. Consequently, we have chosen a rate of infusion that will result in&#xD;
      a clear-cut difference between the baseline and &quot;hyperinsulinemic&quot; values. Further, although&#xD;
      during the insulin infusion we anticipate that insulin concentrations will also be variable,&#xD;
      our endpoints will be assessed in terms of the magnitude of change from the baseline value in&#xD;
      each subject. This statistical approach should minimize concern regarding subject&#xD;
      variability. The dosage was selected because we have previously shown that protein metabolism&#xD;
      is responsive to this rate of infusion (5), but that it is below the maximally-effective dose&#xD;
      (4). Blood glucose concentration will be monitored throughout the second period, and glucose&#xD;
      will be infused (if necessary) to maintain glucose concentrations at the baseline level.&#xD;
      Since the baseline concentrations of glucose will vary, this means that during&#xD;
      hyperinsulinemia the glucose concentrations will likely differ between subjects, but we have&#xD;
      selected this approach because in this way only the insulin concentration will differ between&#xD;
      periods 1 and 2, thereby simplifying interpretation of the changes in substrate and protein&#xD;
      kinetics from period 1 to 2. The sampling schedule will be the same as in period 1, including&#xD;
      the timing of the biopsy (i.e., at 4 h of period 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Leg blood flow will be measured by indocyanine green infusion, ad described previously (14).&#xD;
      Whole-body indirect calorimetry will be performed to quantify whole-body carbohydrate and fat&#xD;
      oxidation.&#xD;
