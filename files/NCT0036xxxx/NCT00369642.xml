  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic and often disabling illness with&#xD;
      an estimated lifetime prevalence of 1 to 3%. Pediatric OCD is associated with significant&#xD;
      social, educational, and familial impairment, as well as comorbid emotional and behavioral&#xD;
      disturbances that serve to complicate the prognosis of the illness and treatment outcome.&#xD;
      While limited open treatment trials and one controlled trial have demonstrated&#xD;
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to be effective for pediatric OCD, controlled trials are&#xD;
      lacking in the literature. There are a number of incremental benefits that an intensive&#xD;
      program for OCD may offer. First, existing outpatient interventions typically achieve&#xD;
      treatment gains over a 15 to 20 week period. The present program typically lasts between 2 to&#xD;
      4 weeks, and thus may present as a more timely, cost-effective, and efficient means of&#xD;
      treatment for some individuals. Second, given that many children and adolescents may not have&#xD;
      access to mental health professionals who are trained in empirically grounded interventions&#xD;
      for OCD, the present treatment setting allows youth to receive appropriate, state of the art&#xD;
      care. Finally, evidence suggests that daily CBT may be particularly effective in treating&#xD;
      children who have been refractory to prior treatments (e.g., medication or once per week&#xD;
      CBT). Prior to treatment, all consenting families will be randomly assigned to either the&#xD;
      treatment condition or a three-week wait-list control condition. Those families randomized to&#xD;
      the wait-list condition will receive treatment immediately after the three weeks are&#xD;
      completed. The treatment group will be administered all measures immediately before&#xD;
      treatment, immediately after treatment, and three months after treatment. The wait-list&#xD;
      control condition will be administered all measures upon starting the wait-list period,&#xD;
      immediately following the conclusion of the three-week wait-list period, and after the&#xD;
      treatment program has finished. The purpose of the current study is to evaluate the efficacy&#xD;
      of daily cognitive-behavioral treatment for pediatric OCD.&#xD;

      Distressing, intrusive thoughts, images, or impulses and repetitive mental or behavioral&#xD;
      rituals aimed to reduce distress are the hallmark of adult and pediatric obsessive-compulsive&#xD;
      disorder (OCD). Epidemiological studies suggest a prevalence rate of between 1 to 4% in&#xD;
      children and adolescents (Douglass, Moffitt, Dar, McGee, &amp; Silva, 1995; Flament, Whitaker,&#xD;
      Rapoport, &amp; Davies, 1988; Zohar, 1999). If untreated, OCD is related to significant social,&#xD;
      academic, and familial impairment (Koran, Thienemann, &amp; Davenport, 1996; Piacentini et al.,&#xD;
      2003).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is a form of psychotherapy with proven efficacy for OCD&#xD;
      treatment in adult populations (see Franklin &amp; Foa, 2002 for a review). More recently,&#xD;
      several open (Benazon, Ager, &amp; Rosenberg, 2002; March, Mulle, &amp; Herbel, 1994; Piacentini,&#xD;
      Bergman, Jacobs, McCracken, &amp; Kretchman, 2002) and one controlled trial (de Haan, Hoogduin,&#xD;
      Buitelaar, &amp; Keijsers, 1998) have supported the effectiveness of this approach with children&#xD;
      and adolescents diagnosed with OCD. Cognitive-behavioral therapy for adult and pediatric OCD&#xD;
      can be broken down into two general components. First, in exposure and response prevention&#xD;
      (ERP), patients are gradually exposed to anxiety-provoking stimuli while refraining from&#xD;
      engaging in compulsive behaviors or rituals (Meyer, 1966). The extended exposure to&#xD;
      anxiety-provoking stimuli causes anxiety to habituate and provides objective data that&#xD;
      contradicts inaccurate expectations of harm and responsibility (Foa &amp; Kozac, 1996). Second,&#xD;
      cognitive therapy teaches the patient to identify and correct anxiety-provoking cognitions&#xD;
      that often motivate compulsive behaviors. Objective, realistic cognitions that are not linked&#xD;
      to obsessive-compulsive anxiety will result in reduced needs to perform compulsive acts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the results of the above mentioned psychotherapy trials, as well as a number of&#xD;
      pharmacological treatment trials, are promising (Cook et al., 2001; DeVeaugh-Geiss, Moroz,&#xD;
      Biederman, &amp; Cantwell, 1992; Geller et al., 2001; Liebowitz et al., 2002; March et al., 1998;&#xD;
      Riddle et al., 2001), it is important to note that a relatively large number of patients do&#xD;
      not respond to treatment in a clinically significant manner. For example, the treatment&#xD;
      response rates in recent major drug trials ranged from 42 to 67% (Cook et al., 2001;&#xD;
      DeVeaugh-Geiss et al., 1992; Geller et al., 2001; Liebowitz et al., 2002; Riddle et al.,&#xD;
      2001), whereas the treatment response rate in the referenced psychotherapy trials ranged from&#xD;
      63 to 79%. As such, it is important to identify and test potential treatment approaches that&#xD;
      may be suitable for treatment refractory pediatric OCD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One manner of treating children with OCD who do no adequately respond to conventional&#xD;
      medication or psychotherapy interventions is through intensive CBT. The UF OCD Program in the&#xD;
      Department of Psychiatry at the University of Florida utilizes the principles of CBT. Our&#xD;
      intensive program provides CBT services to children on an outpatient basis. Intensive&#xD;
      outpatient treatment involves the child and his/her parent(s) or guardian(s) moving to&#xD;
      Gainesville for three weeks, which usually requires staying in a hotel, unless the person has&#xD;
      friends or relatives living in the area. Patients are seen five days per week for&#xD;
      approximately three weeks. Sessions typically involve exposure and response prevention in&#xD;
      conjunction with cognitive therapy for older children. Family members are involved&#xD;
      extensively in treatment to assist with the completion of daily homework exercises and&#xD;
      generalization of skills to the home environment. In addition to being an alternative&#xD;
      approach for treatment refractory youth, there are a number of other benefits that an&#xD;
      intensive program for pediatric OCD may offer. First, an intensive approach may be well&#xD;
      suited for children with severe symptomatology or functional impairment (e.g., not going to&#xD;
      school; Franklin, Tolin, March, &amp; Foa, 2001; Storch, Gelfand, Geffken, &amp; Goodman, 2003).&#xD;
      Second, existing outpatient interventions typically achieve treatment gains over a 15 to 20&#xD;
      week period. Intensive treatment typically lasts three to four weeks, and thus may present as&#xD;
      a more timely, cost-effective, and efficient means of treatment, particularly when the child&#xD;
      is missing out on important normative events (e.g., school attendance). Third, many people do&#xD;
      not have access to mental health professionals who are trained in empirically grounded OCD&#xD;
      treatment and thus, are unable to receive the most effective care. For example, Flament et&#xD;
      al. (1988) found that only 22% of a sample of children with OCD were receiving mental health&#xD;
      services. Moreover, none of those being treated were receiving appropriate, empirically&#xD;
      validated intervention. Finally, time-limited, intensive programs may enhance the child's&#xD;
      motivation by becoming the primary focus for several weeks, which may not be the case with&#xD;
      standard weekly treatment (Foa &amp; Steketee, 1987).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although several open and controlled trials of intensive psychotherapy for adult OCD have&#xD;
      been published (Abramowitz, Foa, &amp; Franklin, 2003; Cottraux et al., 2001; Foa, Kozak,&#xD;
      Steketee, &amp; McCarthy, 1992; Storch et al., 2003), to date, only two examples of intensive&#xD;
      outpatient treatment for OCD in childhood has been reported (Franklin et al., 2001; Storch et&#xD;
      al., 2004). Franklin et al. (2001) describes a 12-year-old boy with severe OCD who was seen&#xD;
      five days per week for a total of 11 sessions. Results indicated marked improvements in&#xD;
      clinician-rated OCD symptoms and self-reported depressive symptoms. Storch et al. (2004)&#xD;
      provides data on five children with OCD consecutively seen in intensive cognitive-behavioral&#xD;
      psychotherapy. Assessments were conducted at baseline and after treatment. All participants&#xD;
      were classified as treatment responders (much improved or very much improved). Two of the&#xD;
      participants did not meet diagnostic criteria for OCD following treatment. The severity of&#xD;
      clinician-rated OCD symptoms and impairment significantly decreased after the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Under the proposed controlled trial, we plan to examine the efficacy of daily&#xD;
      cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy to 50 consecutive children and adolescents who enroll in&#xD;
      the UF OCD program. Children will be randomized to one of two treatment conditions: one&#xD;
      consists of receiving cognitive-behavioral therapy every weekday for three-weeks; the other&#xD;
      consists of receiving treatment as usual, which consists of once per week outpatient&#xD;
      cognitive-behavioral therapy sessions . As compared to the once per week therapy condition,&#xD;
      we predict decreases in OCD, general anxiety, and depressive symptomatology, and functional&#xD;
      impairment at post-intervention for youth in the daily therapy condition.&#xD;
