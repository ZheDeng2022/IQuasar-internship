  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to analyze the respiratory motion process as relevant in&#xD;
      cardiac MRI imaging and apply the results for development of improved imaging methods and&#xD;
      software correction. To accomplish this, we will develop an imaging protocol for monitoring&#xD;
      respiratory motion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The imaging protocol will be limited to less than five minutes of acquisition time so it may&#xD;
      be performed as &quot;piggyback&quot; acquisition following clinically prescribed imaging studies on&#xD;
      pediatric and adult cardiac MRI patients, but will also be applied to normal healthy&#xD;
      volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis Characterization of respiratory motion will help improve image quality by allowing&#xD;
      optimized scan acquisition and retrospective correction of acquired data.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used heavily in the research setting but its use&#xD;
      is limited in clinical practice, the main reason being artifact (noise) from respiratory and&#xD;
      cardiac motion. To counteract these sources of motion, many different applications have been&#xD;
      applied. For cardiac motion, ECG (electrocardiogram) gating is widely used, while respiratory&#xD;
      motion reduction uses methods of breath holding or respiratory gating techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited based on whether they are a normal healthy volunteer or a patient&#xD;
      already receiving a routine cardiac MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normal Healthy Volunteers Patients will be recruited via a flyer posted in various locations&#xD;
      at Emory University. The contents of this flyer will adhere strictly to Emory IRB&#xD;
      Advertisement guidelines. Subjects will register by contacting Marijn Brunner, PhD, by email&#xD;
      or telephone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients already scheduled for a routine cardiac MRI The MRI technical specialist will review&#xD;
      the laboratory schedule daily. Those who are already scheduled for a routine cardiac MRI will&#xD;
      be approached by a study staff member in the Children's MRI Department. The patient will be&#xD;
      asked if he/she would wish to enroll in this study. The patient will be requested to sign a&#xD;
      consent prior to any study procedures being performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI image data will be collected by the prescribed protocol for respiratory monitoring. All&#xD;
      MRI data will be acquired by standard FDA approved imaging methods. The image data will be&#xD;
      transferred by network to the Pediatrics Imaging Research Laboratory where they will be&#xD;
      stored on a password-protected computer and analyzed.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  We will recruit two groups of patients - 35 healthy volunteers (21 years or older) and&#xD;
             25 cardiac MRI patients of different age groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        We wish to recruit cardiac patients from Children's Healthcare of Atlanta into five (5)&#xD;
        different categories defined by the overall characteristics of breathing motion. The&#xD;
        categories are:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. neonates/infants (shallow belly breathing)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. young children (unable to do controlled breathing or breath-holding on command, up to&#xD;
             approximately 7 years of age)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. older children capable of controlled breathing/breath-holding on command&#xD;
             (approximately 8-12 years of age)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. teenagers/adolescents/young adults (ages 13 through 17)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. adults (18 and older) These categories may be adjusted or modified during the project&#xD;
             as deemed appropriate based on the analysis results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        We will recruit 10 - 35 healthy volunteer subjects for scans to define the MRI imaging&#xD;
        protocol for respiratory motion monitoring. Healthy subjects are defined as those&#xD;
        individuals who do not have a prior history of heart or lung disease nor are currently&#xD;
        diagnosed with heart or lung disease. This information will be obtained verbally during the&#xD;
        subject screening process.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No exclusion criteria will be placed on any sub-population based on age, gender or&#xD;
             race other than the patient not freely giving written informed consent or having a&#xD;
             history or current diagnosis of heart or lung disease. However, the normal exclusion&#xD;
             criteria for MRI exams will still be adhered to:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. subjects with pacemakers, medical implants, aneurysm clips, or imbedded metal&#xD;
                  fragments will be excluded because of potential effects of the magnetic field&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. women who are pregnant or who may be pregnant will be excluded because of the&#xD;
                  potential of a high level of RF power deposition on the fetus&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. subjects who may experience claustrophobia will be excluded because of their&#xD;
                  inability to remain in the magnet for the time required to complete the exam&#xD;
