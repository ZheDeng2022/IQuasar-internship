  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to gather information to better understand the characteristics,&#xD;
      medical management techniques and outcomes of patients with chronic severe Heart Failure&#xD;
      (HF).&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This objectives of this observational registry are: to assess changes in patient quality of&#xD;
      life as a function of medical management and disease progression as measured by the rate of&#xD;
      death and rehospitalization, and assist with the optimization of heart failure (HF)&#xD;
      management by providing information on the use of therapies proven to be effective and to&#xD;
      describe practices of standard of care for chronic treatment of symptoms of HF outside the&#xD;
      hospital and during hospitalization for acute episode with intravenous vasoactive medication&#xD;
      (drugs which affect the blood vessels and muscle of the heart). Additional information which&#xD;
      will be gathered include patient characteristics (age, sex, race, medical history, symptoms),&#xD;
      infusion setting, type of medication, dose and frequency of medication and worsening of&#xD;
      congestive heart failure disease. Participants in the study receive an unique&#xD;
      patient-specific identifier and all available data will be analyzed. Observational Study - No&#xD;
      investigational drug administered&#xD;
