      The purpose of this study is to review patients with E. coli infections at the University of&#xD;
      Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) from September 1, 2006 to August 31, 2007 to determine if&#xD;
      these infections have arisen in the community rather than in hospitals or nursing homes. The&#xD;
      occurrence of such resistant isolates could be devastating if they were associated with&#xD;
      bloodstream infection, such as sometimes accompanies a urinary tract infection, since&#xD;
      antibiotic resistant E. coli is not suspected in isolates coming from the community.&#xD;
      Therefore, the aims of this study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Review whether extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing organisms (E. coli,&#xD;
           Klebsiella species and Proteus species) are hospital-acquired, healthcare-associated, or&#xD;
           community-associated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Investigate the prevalence of ESBL-positive E. coli in foodstuffs (beef, poultry,&#xD;
           turkey, and pork), as a potential source for ESBL producers in the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Compare the clonal relationship of the genome and resistance plasmids carried by the&#xD;
           ESBL-producing isolates (healthcare-associated, community-associated, and of animal&#xD;
           origin) and study the associations of ESBL-mediated resistance with resistance to other&#xD;
           classes of antimicrobials.&#xD;

      The following variables will be followed: age, sex, occupation, hospital location at the time&#xD;
      of positive culture (ER, medical ward, ICU, etc.), prior hospitalization or nursing home&#xD;
      admission, receipt of outpatient dialysis, home care or other regular medical care (eg,&#xD;
      outpatient chemotherapy), presence of invasive devices, receipt of antibiotics, including&#xD;
      their type and whether they were adequate for the resistance profile of the organism, and&#xD;
      prior positive microbiologic cultures. All sites are collecting the following information&#xD;
      that was collected as part of the patient's clinical treatment. The following variables will&#xD;
      be collected at all sites: time and location of positive cultures, underlying diseases and&#xD;
      severity of illness, presence of urinary or intravascular devices, recent immunomodulative&#xD;
      therapies or radiation therapy, physical exam findings, laboratory and radiographical data,&#xD;
      antimicrobial usage within 30 days of onset of the infection, microbiological data and&#xD;
      resistance patterns, choice of antibiotics once the organism is identified, bacteriological&#xD;
      outcomes, laboratory results, demographic information, medications, clinical outcome, gender,&#xD;
      height, weight, ethnicity, and past medical history. We will collect information&#xD;
      prospectively for one year. The bacteria in the patient's cultures will be subcultured (after&#xD;
      the diagnosis has been obtained since the microbiology lab would otherwise destroy the&#xD;
      culture) and provided to the honest broker who will de-identify the specimen and link it to&#xD;
      the medical information collected (which will also be de-identified by the honest broker).&#xD;
      The following evaluation will be performed on these samples. The minimal inhibitory&#xD;
      concentration of the antibiotic used in treatment will be performed by the E-Test method (AB&#xD;
      Biodisk, Solna, Sweden). Specific mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance will be studied with&#xD;
      emphasis on the presence of beta-lactamases produced by the bacteria. This evaluation will be&#xD;
      performed by analytical isoelectric focusing techniques as well as PCR and gene sequencing&#xD;
      analysis to determine genes encoding beta-lactamases. Biologic samples will be under the&#xD;
      control of the principal investigator of this research project. All samples provided to the&#xD;
      investigators are de-identified by the honest broker and will be coded with numbers. The&#xD;
      information linking these code numbers to the corresponding subjects' identities will be kept&#xD;
      in a separate, secure location that only the honest broker has access to. The investigators&#xD;
      on this study will keep the samples indefinitely. Samples will be kept in the investigator's&#xD;
      laboratory located in Scaife Hall, room 812, 3500 Terrace Street. At no time will the&#xD;
      research investigators have access to any patient identifiers. Medical record information and&#xD;
      bacteria samples from facilities outside of UPMC will be provided to the PI de-identified. At&#xD;
      no time will anyone on the research team have access to patient identifiers. All information&#xD;
      and bacteria are collected as part of the patient's clinical treatment.&#xD;

      No genetic testing will be performed on any of the samples being obtained. The biologic&#xD;
      samples will be under the control of the principal investigator of this research project. To&#xD;
      protect confidentiality, all personal identifiers (i.e., name, social security number, and&#xD;
      birth date) will be removed (de-identified) and replaced with a specific code number. The&#xD;
      information linking these code numbers to the corresponding subjects' identities will be kept&#xD;
      in a separate, secure location. The investigators on this study will keep the samples&#xD;
      indefinitely. If a subject withdraws and provides the request in writing, samples collected&#xD;
      and not already processed will be destroyed. All samples will be kept in the investigator's&#xD;
      laboratory located in Scaife Hall, Room 812, 3550 Terrace Street.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients with E. coli, Klebsiella species, and Proteus species infections during&#xD;
             the time period of the study will be reviewed. A community-associated E. coli isolate&#xD;
             will be defined as one which was recovered from a clinical culture from a patient at&#xD;
             UPMC who had no established risk factors for infection with an antibiotic resistant&#xD;
             organism. Established risk factors are defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Isolation of the organism two or more days after admission for hospitalization OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  History of hospitalization, surgery, dialysis, or residence in a long-term care&#xD;
                  facility within one year before the culture date OR&#xD;

               -  The presence of an indwelling catheter or percutaneous medical device (eg,&#xD;
                  tracheostomy tube, gastrostomy tube, or Foley catheter) at the time of the&#xD;
                  culture OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Previous isolation of an antibiotic resistant organism.&#xD;
