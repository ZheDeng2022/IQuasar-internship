  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In summary, the investigators want to investigate whether UTE sequences are capable to&#xD;
      replace imaging techniques involving ionizing radiation for bone imaging in the future. This&#xD;
      would improve patient care greatly and might reduce medical imaging associated cancer risk&#xD;
      drastically from an epidemiological standpoint. This field of research can be considered&#xD;
      cutting-edge. The investigators determine this study promising to provide substantial&#xD;
      generalizable knowledge and hope that this study results will improve patient care worldwide&#xD;
      considerably.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To date, definite depiction of anatomy or pathologies of bony structures requires ionizing&#xD;
      radiation by using radiographs or computed tomography (CT) since conventional magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI) that does not require ionizing radiation cannot depict bony&#xD;
      structures well. Modern MR techniques, collectively referred to as ultrashort time to echo&#xD;
      (UTE) sequences, have overcome this issue by acquiring the signal data much faster and&#xD;
      therefore are able to acquire sufficient MR signal from bony structures. The investigators&#xD;
      want to investigate if UTE sequences are capable to depict bony anatomy and pathology similar&#xD;
      to imaging examination techniques involving ionizing radiation. Healthy adult and minor&#xD;
      participants, as well as adult and minor participants, referred for a clinically indicated&#xD;
      MRI involving the skeletal system will be included.&#xD;
