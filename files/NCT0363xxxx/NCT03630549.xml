      This cluster-randomized trial tests a differentiated care model for HIV-positive individuals&#xD;
      not on ART during a home-based HIV testing campaign in rural Lesotho, Southern Africa. In&#xD;
      intervention clusters, patients are offered a differentiated ART delivery package with two&#xD;
      features. Firstly, drug-refill and follow-up are provided by village health workers (VHW),&#xD;
      reducing clinic visits to twice a year for laboratory assessment. Secondly, participants have&#xD;
      the option of receiving individually tailored adherence reminders and viral load result&#xD;
      notifications via SMS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The VIBRA trial is a cluster randomized controlled, open-label, superiority trial in a&#xD;
      resource-limited setting. The trial is linked to a another trial, the HOSENG (HOme-based&#xD;
      SElf-testiNG) trial, that is described elsewhere (NCT03598686). Together, they consitute the&#xD;
      GET ON (GETing tOwards Ninety) research project. The HOSENG study, with its home-based HIV&#xD;
      testing campaign, provides the recruitment platform for the VIBRA study. The reasons for this&#xD;
      interlinked design are: a) potential study participants for VIBRA trial (HIV-positive&#xD;
      individuals not on ART) are to be recruited during a home-based HIV testing campaign and&#xD;
      hence, it allows us to assess the entire HIV care cascade in one larger project, and b) both&#xD;
      trials rely on interventions involving VHWs, who need to be randomized and specifically&#xD;
      trained. Therefore, it is efficient and feasible to run both trials parallel and randomize at&#xD;
      one time point only. The rational for a cluster randomized design is the reliance of the&#xD;
      trial on the VHWs and, thus, the high risk of cross-contamination between the study arms if&#xD;
      randomization would be done at individual level.&#xD;
