  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression is a prevalent and debilitating disorder. The most common treatments are&#xD;
      antidepressant medications and talking therapies. However, for many individuals, these are&#xD;
      not their treatment of choice. Furthermore, even following a full course of treatment with an&#xD;
      antidepressant or talking therapy, over one third of patients continue to be unwell.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The novel brain stimulation treatment, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), is a&#xD;
      potential first-line treatment for major depression. The present research question is whether&#xD;
      tDCS can be provided as a home-based treatment for major depression for adults with major&#xD;
      depression.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The novel brain stimulation treatment, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), is a&#xD;
      potential first-line treatment for major depression. tDCS generates a small electric current&#xD;
      which modulates how easy it is for active brain cells to discharge. The device is a neoprene&#xD;
      cap worn over the head, and in the cap there are two electrodes, which are small metal discs,&#xD;
      where the current comes from. tDCS does not directly stimulate brain cells to cause a seizure&#xD;
      like electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and it does not induce brain cells to discharge like&#xD;
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical studies have shown that tDCS treatment could help to improve the symptoms of&#xD;
      depression. The main side effects have been redness, skin irritation or sensations (itching,&#xD;
      tingling or burning) under the electrodes. Less commonly reported side effects include&#xD;
      headache or tiredness. tDCS is a portable and safe treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The studies to date have mostly looked at tDCS treatment which has been provided in a&#xD;
      research setting. This is a problem because the treatment requires daily sessions for several&#xD;
      weeks which could limit whether individuals would be able to go every day. As tDCS is a&#xD;
      portable and safe treatment, it could be provided in the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study research question is whether tDCS could be provided as a home-based treatment for&#xD;
      major depression. The study will include adults with major depression.&#xD;
