  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has become the standard procedure for staging of patients&#xD;
      with clinically node-negative breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breast-conserving surgery (BCS) has also been a standard treatment for patients with early&#xD;
      breast cancer. However, approximately 10% of patients with BCS develop ipsilateral breast&#xD;
      tumor recurrence (IBTR), and mastectomy or resection of the recurrent tumor is generally&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no specific guidelines available regarding staging and treatment of the regional&#xD;
      lymph nodes. However, the reported risk of axillary lymph node metastasis among patients with&#xD;
      local recurrence after breast surgery and a previous negative sentinel node biopsy of 26 % is&#xD;
      too high to be ignored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, evaluation of the regional lymph node basins might be helpful to decide on the&#xD;
      indication for adjuvant radiotherapy and systemic treatment. For these reasons it seems&#xD;
      sensible to perform a regional lymph node staging procedure in patients with locally&#xD;
      recurrent breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In general practice, this would mean that patients with recurrent breast cancer and a&#xD;
      previous negative sentinel node biopsy would receive an axillary lymph node dissection (ALND)&#xD;
      and that patients with a previous ALND would receive no additional axillary staging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lymphatic drainage after previous breast surgery and/or radiotherapy would be altered and it&#xD;
      remains questionable whether SLNB at the time of surgery for IBTR (second SLNB) is&#xD;
      technically feasible and ALND can safely be omitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, investigators propose for all patients the realization of SLNB procedure and&#xD;
      systematically ALND whatever the results of SLNB analysis, only on patients previously&#xD;
      treated with breast conservative surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate on a homogeneous prospective multicentric cohort of&#xD;
      patients the feasibility and the accuracy of a second SLNB procedure for IBTR.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      FIGARO is a prospective multicentre phase-2 study that aims to evaluate technical feasibility&#xD;
      and validity of performing second sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) in patients with IBTR&#xD;
      .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to evaluate the feasibility and the accuracy of a second SLNB in&#xD;
      IBTR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective are :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The frequency of lymph node involvement&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The impact of axillary involvement on the therapeutic strategy, in particular&#xD;
           radiotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluation of extra-axillary lymphatic drainage&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The correlation between the detection rate of sentinel lymph node and the delay, in&#xD;
           months, between the end of primary cancer radiotherapy and recurrence&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The occurrence of 5-year-old locoregional lymph node recurrence&#xD;
&#xD;
      To be included, patients must have a biopsy assessing an ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence,&#xD;
      and a diagnosis of invasive carcinoma after a previous diagnosis of breast cancer that has&#xD;
      been treated by breast conservative surgery at least one year before (time between the end of&#xD;
      the previous radiotherapy and the diagnosis of recurrence).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At time of recurrence, the patients must be evaluated by X-ray mammography and&#xD;
      ultrasonography examination of breast and axilla, and a full general assessment to eliminate&#xD;
      distant metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Local recurrences will be operated by breast conservative surgery (BCS) or mastectomy. The&#xD;
      decision between BCS and mastectomy will be carefully considered, in accordance with patient&#xD;
      preference and other clinical features such as tumor location, tumor size, and breast size&#xD;
      taken into account.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will have a second SLNB followed by a systematic complete ALND. Before the SLNB&#xD;
      procedure, each patient will have a lymphoscintigraphy to evaluate axillary and extra&#xD;
      axillary lymphatic mapping. Lymphoscintigraphy will be performed according to previously&#xD;
      reported standard techniques. At 2-20 h after lymphoscintigraphy, SLNB will be performed with&#xD;
      or without a blue dye associated injection. An intraoperative gamma ray detection probe will&#xD;
      be used during surgery to conﬁrm locations of the sentinel nodes and to facilitate their&#xD;
      removal. All sentinel nodes will be removed and sent for histopathologic examination&#xD;
      according to previously described standard techniques. A complete ALND (Berg's stage I and&#xD;
      II) will be realized and the nodes will be sent for standard histopathologic examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further systemic adjuvant therapies will be chosen in a multidisciplinary approach&#xD;
      considering prognostic and predictive indicators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the patients will be followed up for 5 years at 12-month intervals after the second&#xD;
      surgery and undergo annual mammography with or without ultrasonography.&#xD;
