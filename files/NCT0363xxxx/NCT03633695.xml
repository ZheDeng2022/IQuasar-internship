      The purpose of this study is to determine if the IC-8 intraocular lens (IOL) implanted in one&#xD;
      eye and a standard monofocal or monofocal toric IOL implanted in the fellow eye will provide&#xD;
      improved intermediate and near vision with fewer visual symptoms when compared to a standard&#xD;
      monofocal or monofocal toric IOL implanted in both eyes during cataract surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Patient expectations of spectacle independence at all distances following cataract&#xD;
      surgery have substantially increased in recent years.Though most of the contemporary&#xD;
      presbyopia-correcting premium intraocular lenses (IOLs) provide adequate functional vision&#xD;
      and patient satisfaction, each has advantages and disadvantages. Multifocal and trifocal IOLs&#xD;
      provide good functional vision, but they are limited by reduced contrast, visual disturbances&#xD;
      and, with discrete non-continuous range of vision. More recently, extended range of vision&#xD;
      IOLs that are designed to improve vision from far to intermediate or near distances have been&#xD;
      introduced to the market.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The design and mechanism of action of the AcuFocus, Inc., IC-8 IOL is based on the&#xD;
      well-established concept of small aperture (small hole) optics. In cameras, depth of focus is&#xD;
      controlled by reducing the aperture through which light enters; the smaller the aperture, the&#xD;
      greater the depth of focus. This concept also applies to the human eye. If an opaque disc&#xD;
      with a small aperture in the center is placed in front of the eye, the peripheral rays will&#xD;
      be obscured while the central rays pass unaffected. Since peripheral rays enter the eye at&#xD;
      larger angle, they create a larger blur circle at the retinal image plane. Eliminating these&#xD;
      peripheral rays reduces the size of the blur-circle, improving image resolution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IC-8 IOL (AcuFocus, Inc.) is a small aperture IOL that reduces defocus by decreasing the&#xD;
      size of the blur circle to achieve extended depth of focus. The relation between reducing&#xD;
      pinhole size and improving visual acuity in patients with refractive ametropia has been well&#xD;
      established. This principle is currently being used successfully via the KAMRA inlay&#xD;
      (AcuFocus Inc.), which was FDA-approved for presbyopia correction in April 2015. The small&#xD;
      aperture IOL is thought to provide good uncorrected intermediate and near vision with fewer&#xD;
      visual symptoms and potentially a greater tolerance to residual astigmatism as a result of&#xD;
      its extended depth of focus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To determine the safety and effectiveness of the IC-8 IOL implanted in one eye and&#xD;
      a monofocal IOL implanted in the fellow eye, in accordance with the indication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Prospective, multi-center, open-label, parallel-group, non-randomized,&#xD;
      examiner-masked,one-year clinical study. Study Population: 475 patients with bilateral&#xD;
      cataracts who require cataract surgery.&#xD;
