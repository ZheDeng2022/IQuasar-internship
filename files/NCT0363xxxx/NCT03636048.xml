  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigator aimed to compare the effect of anesthesia on overall postoperative outcomes&#xD;
      including post-operative pain score and the fetal well-being (heart rate) in patients&#xD;
      undergoing transabdominal cervico isthmic cerclage(TCIC). The investigator divided the&#xD;
      patients into two groups. The first group was the patients who undergo general anesthesia&#xD;
      with postoperative wound patient-controlled analgesia device(PCA) and the second group was&#xD;
      the patients who undergo combined spinal-epidural anesthesia(CSE) with postoperative epidural&#xD;
      catheter PCA device for pain control.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Transabdominal cervico isthmic cerclage(TCIC) is performed for the pregnants with Incompetent&#xD;
      Internal Os of the Cervix(IIOC) to maintain pregnancy. It is the operation that incise the&#xD;
      lower abdomen and ligate the cervix in pelvic cavity. In our center, the surgery was&#xD;
      conventionally performed under general anesthesia. Also, for pain control, operator has been&#xD;
      inserting a catheter into the incision site and connected the wound PCA. In this way, there&#xD;
      were some limitations that the wound PCA could only control the somatic pain and there were&#xD;
      significant rates of post-operative nausea and vomiting as common complication of general&#xD;
      anesthesia. Thus, the investigator planned to conduct combined spinal-epidural&#xD;
      anesthesia(CSE) with postoperative pain control with epidural catheter and compare overall&#xD;
      postoperative outcomes with conventional general anesthesia.&#xD;

    <description>Spinal anesthesia is used for operation with epidural patient-controlled device for pain control. Bupivacaine Hcl 0.5% Inj. 9-10mg is injected into intrathecal space for anesthesia. 0.2% ropivacaine is used for postoperative pain control with continuous infusion into epidural space.</description>

    <description>General anesthesia is used for operation with wound patient-controlled device for pain control. propofol (10milligram/ML) 1.5-2 mg/ml is used as bolus intravascular injection for induction of anesthesia. 0.5% ropivacaine is used for postoperative pain control with continous infusion through wound catheter.</description>

    <description>The patients undergo surgery under spinal anesthesia and a catheter would be inserted into epidural space during the procedure. 0.5% bupivacaine is injected into intrathecal space for spinal anesthesia. For pain control, 0.2% ropivacaine is continuously infused into epidural space postoperatively.</description>

    <description>The patients undergo surgery under general anesthesia and a catheter would be inserted to abdominal incision site at the end of the operation. Propofol is used for induction of general anesthesia, and sevoflurane is used for maintenance of anesthesia. At the end of the operation, the surgeon inserts wound catheter in the surgical site and connects wound patient-controlled analgesia device filled with 0.5% ropivacaine.</description>
