    <textblock>
      This study assesses the safety of using tissue autograft of a pedicled temporoparietal&#xD;
      fascial (TPF) or pericranial flap into the resection cavity of newly diagnosed glioblastoma&#xD;
      multiforme (GBM) patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to demonstrate that this surgical technique is safe in a small&#xD;
      human cohort of patients with resected newly diagnosed GBM and may improve progression-free&#xD;
      survival (PFS).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary central nervous system malignancy in adults,&#xD;
      and accounts for over half of all malignant brain tumors. The prognosis for newly diagnosed&#xD;
      GBM is extremely poor even with Stupp protocol consisting of surgery followed by temozolomide&#xD;
      and radiotherapy. Present therapies are inadequate, as evidenced by the low 5-year survival&#xD;
      rate for brain cancer patients, with median survival at approximately 12 months and treatment&#xD;
      for GBM remains a significant unmet clinical need in oncology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects included in the study will initially undergo standard surgical resection for&#xD;
      newly diagnosed GBM. Following the resection, the surgical cavity will be lined with a long&#xD;
      pedicled, autologous piece of tissue called a temporoparietal fascial flap or pericranium.&#xD;
      The patient's dura, bone and scalp will be closed as is customary. The permeability of the&#xD;
      blood vessels of the TPF or pericranial flap should allow for improved delivery of&#xD;
      therapeutics and immune cells (macrophages and T cells) into the vicinity, extracellular&#xD;
      space and microenvironment of the resected tumor cavity including the brain adjacent to the&#xD;
      GBM. The TPF or pericranial flap would easily conform to many resected GBM cavities in our&#xD;
      human patients with acceptable risk. The TPF and pericranial flap with its predictable and&#xD;
      rich vascular anatomy have been shown to be an ideal flap for cases of previously irradiated&#xD;
      and/or infected wound beds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that a TPF or pericranial flap that is harvested in our&#xD;
      patients with resected GBM may be used as a readily available and accessible means of&#xD;
      circumventing the blood brain barrier selectively and focally. The investigators aim to prove&#xD;
      that this surgical technique is safe in a small human cohort of patients with resected newly&#xD;
      diagnosed GBM and may improve progression-free survival (PFS).&#xD;

    <time_frame>Study Day 1-180</time_frame>
    <description>Increase in tumor size relative to baseline will be measured using RANO and assessed by MRI throughout study at 24 hours, 7 days, 30 days, 60 days, 90 days, 180 days. Rapidly progressive disease is defined as 25% growth relative to baseline.</description>

    <measure>Safety parameter: proportion of patients experiencing increase in seizures, stroke, and infection</measure>
    <time_frame>Study Day 1-180</time_frame>
    <description>Increase in seizures (defined as 15% relative to baseline), occurrence of a stroke, or occurrence of a severe infection will be determined throughout study at 24 hours, 7 days, 30 days, 60 days, 90 days, 180 days.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of patients who are alive at 6 months from flap implantation and are progression-free will be estimated using standard methods for proportions, along with the associated exact 95% confidence interval. All patients will be followed for a minimum of six months from the time of implantation. For this analysis, patients who are lost to follow-up prior to 6 months will be (conservatively) assumed as treatment failures at 6 months. The investigators will also estimate PFS using the Kaplan-Meier Product Limit Method. For this analysis, subjects who are alive and have not progressed as of the date of last follow-up will be considered censored.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>OS will be calculated as the time from treatment initiation (TPF implantation) to the time of death. Subjects who are alive as of the date of last follow-up will be considered censored for survival. OS will be analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier Product Limit Method.</description>
