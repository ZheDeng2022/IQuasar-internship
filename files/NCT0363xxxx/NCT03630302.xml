    <textblock>
      The current study aims to explore the functional use of LFPs recorded intraoperatively for&#xD;
      the optimization of a directional DBS lead programming&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim-1: To determine whether intraoperative LFPs recorded from the segmented DBS electrode can&#xD;
      predict the optimal stimulation parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim-2: Compare the therapeutic window for stimulation delivered through directional and&#xD;
      conventional leads and determine if the spatiospectral LFP patterns correlate with the&#xD;
      presence of stimulation side effects.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a feasibility study designed to evaluate the usefulness of intraoperative LFP&#xD;
      recordings obtained from the implanted DBS lead to predict ideal stimulation parameters.&#xD;
      Additionally this study will compare the therapeutic window for stimulation delivered through&#xD;
      directional and conventional leads and determine if the spatiospectral LFP patterns correlate&#xD;
      with the presence of stimulation side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 15 subjects will be enrolled in this clinical investigation. The clinical&#xD;
      investigation will be conducted at 2 centers in the USA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects participating in this clinical investigation will monitored during DBS implant&#xD;
      procedure and programming. The expected duration of enrollment is 8 months. The total&#xD;
      duration of the clinical investigation is expected to be 1 year.&#xD;

        In this study the investigators will explore the predictive capacity of LFPs recorded from&#xD;
        STN. In total, 15 patients undergoing bilateral STN DBS will be enrolled for this&#xD;
        investigation over a 1-year period. The current surgical case load at BCM supports this&#xD;
        level of enrollment. The details of implantation procedures and blinded trial design are&#xD;
        given in the following sections&#xD;

Local field potentials (LFPs) were measured intraoperatively during DBS implant. Features such as beta band power (10-30Hz), high-frequency oscillation power (200-400Hz, HFO), as well as the cross frequency coupling between beta band power and HFO (CFC) were extracted from the LFP recordings from all electrodes.

          <title>Number of DBS Leads With Clinical Programming at 3 Months That Were Consistent With Predictions Via LFP Features After DBS Implant Procedure</title>
          <description>From all DBS leads (2 per patient):&#xD;
Local field potentials (LFPs) were measured intraoperatively during DBS implant. Features such as beta band power (10-30Hz), high-frequency oscillation power (200-400Hz, HFO), as well as the cross frequency coupling between beta band power and HFO (CFC) were extracted from the LFP recordings from all electrodes. Electrodes with the most beta band power, most HFOs, and most CFC were documented.&#xD;
At 3 month post-op visit, the clinically programmed stimulation electrodes were documented, and were compared to the electrodes documented from the intraoperative LFP measures. Both matches in the exact contact and the row at which the contacts were in were documented and compared.</description>
