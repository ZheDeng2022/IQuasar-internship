  <brief_summary>

      We are pursuing a pilot study to assess the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of&#xD;
      adapting a critical time intervention (CTI) approach for adults with schizophrenia who have&#xD;
      been admitted for the inpatient treatment of ambulatory care sensitive conditions. These are&#xD;
      common health conditions, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or short-term&#xD;
      complications from diabetes mellitus, in which appropriate ambulatory care prevents or&#xD;
      reduces the need for inpatient treatment. A 2-arm pilot study will randomize 80 eligible&#xD;
      inpatients to receive either: 1) treatment as usual (TAU) (N=20); or 2) CTI and TAU (N=40).&#xD;
      Participants assigned to CTI will meet with a CTI care manger during their inpatient stay and&#xD;
      over a 3-month period following hospital discharge. CTI care managers will assess and address&#xD;
      patient needs and barriers to outpatient medical and mental health care and provide support&#xD;
      and assistance with health and mental health care management. The primary outcome measure&#xD;
      will be all-cause hospital readmissions at 7 and 30 days following discharge. Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes will include follow-up with medical and mental health at 7 and 30 days following&#xD;
      hospital discharge. Patients receiving CTI will also receive 6 and 12 week assessments to&#xD;
      evaluate secondary outcomes including satisfaction with CTI services, psychiatric symptoms,&#xD;
      community function, and involvement in medical care decisions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For adults with schizophrenia, the transition from hospital inpatient to outpatient care&#xD;
      poses substantial risks of treatment disengagement. Traditional case management approaches&#xD;
      for patients with schizophrenia have involved telephonic follow-up after discharge from&#xD;
      inpatient mental health care and have yielded poor results. Much less information exists&#xD;
      regarding outcomes for patients with schizophrenia discharged following inpatient medical&#xD;
      care. Given that these patients often have difficulty accessing and adhering to medical&#xD;
      treatments, patients with schizophrenia who are admitted to a hospital for treatment of a&#xD;
      medical condition are especially vulnerable to failed care transitions. Intensive&#xD;
      interventions involving home visits, social support, motivational interviewing, and&#xD;
      accompanying patients to outpatient appointments have shown positive results for patients&#xD;
      discharged following inpatient mental health care, and may therefore be effective for&#xD;
      patients with schizophrenia discharged following inpatient medical care. Critical Time&#xD;
      Intervention (CTI) is a novel evidence based time-limited intervention that involves ongoing&#xD;
      community-based contacts with patients from trained care managers to facilitate connections&#xD;
      to aftercare providers and community and support systems following hospital discharge. This&#xD;
      pilot study will adapt CTI for use with patients with schizophrenia who are admitted to one&#xD;
      of 2 safety net hospitals in Bronx, New York, for treatment of ambulatory care sensitive&#xD;
      conditions (medical conditions for which appropriate ambulatory care should limit the need&#xD;
      for inpatient treatment). We will randomize 80 eligible inpatients to receive either: 1)&#xD;
      treatment as usual (TAU) (n=20); or 2) CTI and TAU (n=40). During a 3-month period prior to&#xD;
      randomization, an Adaptation Team of research and hospital staff will review data from&#xD;
      qualitative interviews of clinical staff and patients to identify factors likely to&#xD;
      facilitate and impede CTI implementation. The team will then adapt the CTI to increase the&#xD;
      likelihood of successful implementation. In the randomization phase, participants assigned to&#xD;
      CTI will meet with a CTI care manger during their inpatient stay and over a 3-month period&#xD;
      following hospital discharge. CTI care managers will assess and address patient needs and&#xD;
      barriers to outpatient medical and mental health care and provide support and assistance with&#xD;
      medical and mental health care management. For quantitative analyses, the primary outcome&#xD;
      measures will be all-cause hospital readmissions at 7 and 30 days following discharge.&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes will include follow-up with medical and mental health outpatient care at 7&#xD;
      and 30 days following hospital discharge. Patients receiving CTI will also be assessed to&#xD;
      evaluate satisfaction with CTI services, psychiatric symptoms, community function, and&#xD;
      involvement in medical care decisions. The proposed study will test whether a time-limited&#xD;
      novel intervention helps overcome common barriers to adherence with outpatient medical and&#xD;
      mental health care and reduces hospital readmissions for a vulnerable population.&#xD;
