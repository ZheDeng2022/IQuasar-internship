      Plasma concentration data were collected from 37 paedriatic patients and 12 healthy adults&#xD;
      recruited in a single dose, open-label phase II pharmacokinetic study and in a single dose,&#xD;
      randomised, open-label two-peiod crossover bioavailability study, respectively. Data were&#xD;
      analysed using non-linear mixed effect modeling.&#xD;

      In the absence of a licensed formulation in many countries worldwide, ADV6209, an innovative&#xD;
      2mg/ml oral solution of midazolam containing cyclodextrin, has been developed for moderate&#xD;
      sedation in paediatric patients. Population pharmacokinetics for ADV6209 is reported.&#xD;

      randomised, open-label two-peiod crossover bioavailability study, respectively. Data were&#xD;
      analysed using non-linear mixed effect modeling. Plasma concentrations of midazolam were&#xD;
      discribed by a two-compartement model. An additional one-compartement model was added for a&#xD;
      α-hydroxymidazolam.&#xD;

    <description>The Aim of the study was to assess the pharmacokinetic analysis of an oral solution of midazolam (ADV6209) oral formulation in paedriatic patients from 6 months to 18 years ols in order to support dosing recommendations. All subjects received a single 0.3mg/kg midazolam dose of ADV6209, without exceeding a total dose of 10 mg.Population pharmacokinetic modelling was performed to characterise the concentration-time course of midazolam and its main active metabolite, and to evaluate the changes in clearance and volume of distibution in the different age groups.</description>

        The planned enrollment is 36 children, stratified in two groups: 24 children between 6&#xD;
        months and 11 years, and 12 children between 12 and 17 years. Age is considered in years&#xD;
        past by the date of inclusion. Children aged between 6 months and 11 years old should be&#xD;
        homogenous in both age groups 6-23 months and 2-11 years. For example, at least 4 children&#xD;
        in the 6-23 month age group will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Children likely to be included will be hospitalized in the pediatric surgery department at&#xD;
        Amiens University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Children who will be included in this study will not be able to participate in another&#xD;
        study within 3 months of their inclusion in this study.&#xD;
