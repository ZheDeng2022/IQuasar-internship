  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to determine the effect of kefir on appetite in healthy subjects. A&#xD;
      randomized, single-blind, and 3-intervention crossover trial included 22 healthy and&#xD;
      normal-weight (BMI 18.5-25 kg/m2) females aged 21-24 years. Participants were recruited to&#xD;
      three test meals: an LGI-Milk, an LGI-Kefir, and an HGI-Kefir, with a one-week washout&#xD;
      period. Appetite ratings were measured at 0, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 minutes. At&#xD;
      the end of three hours, participants were served an ad libitum lunch meal. Then, the foods&#xD;
      eaten at lunch were recorded and their energy and nutrient analysis was calculated.&#xD;

    <measure>Hunger rating</measure>
    <time_frame>Three hours postprandial period</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective assessment of appetite sensations was performed by using a visual analog scale (VAS) composed of lines (of 100 mm in length) with words anchored at each end, expressing the most positive and the most negative rating. VAS ratings were measured by using a question &quot;How hungry do you feel? (not at all hungry - as hungry as I ever felt)&quot; at time points 0, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 minutes, and hunger rating was quantified as AUC (mm x min), which was calculated according to the trapezoidal rule by using those VAS scores. Total scale score changes in a range of 0-100. Higher values represent a worse outcome.</description>

    <measure>Fullness rating</measure>
    <time_frame>Three hours postprandial period</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective assessment of appetite sensations was performed by using a visual analog scale (VAS) composed of lines (of 100 mm in length) with words anchored at each end, expressing the most positive and the most negative rating. VAS ratings were measured by using a question &quot;How full do you feel? (not at all full - totally full)&quot; at time points 0, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 minutes, and fullness rating was quantified as AUC (mm x min), which was calculated according to the trapezoidal rule by using those VAS scores. Total scale score changes in a range of 0-100. Higher values represent a better outcome.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Desiring to eat</measure>
    <time_frame>Three hours postprandial period</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective assessment of appetite sensations was performed by using a visual analog scale (VAS) composed of lines (of 100 mm in length) with words anchored at each end, expressing the most positive and the most negative rating. VAS ratings were measured by using a question &quot;How strong is your desire to eat? (very weak - very strong)&quot; at time points 0, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 minutes, and desiring to eat was quantified as AUC (mm x min), which was calculated according to the trapezoidal rule by using those VAS scores. Total scale score changes in a range of 0-100. Higher values represent a worse outcome.</description>

    <measure>Prospective food consumption</measure>
    <time_frame>Three hours postprandial period</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective assessment of appetite sensations was performed by using a visual analog scale (VAS) composed of lines (of 100 mm in length) with words anchored at each end, expressing the most positive and the most negative rating. VAS ratings were measured by using a question &quot;How much do you think you can eat? (no food at all - a large amount of food)&quot; at time points 0, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 minutes, and prospective food consumption was quantified as AUC (mm x min), which was calculated according to the trapezoidal rule by using those VAS scores. Total scale score changes in a range of 0-100. Higher values represent a worse outcome.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Composite appetite score</measure>
    <time_frame>Three hours postprandial period</time_frame>
    <description>The separate visual analog scale factors like hunger, fullness, desiring for eat, and prospective food consumption were combined to produce an additional measure termed 'composite appetite score'. This average appetite score was computed for 0, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 minutes using the following equation: [(hunger + desire to eat + prospective food consumption + (100 - fullness)]/4 Total scale score changes in a range of 0-100. Higher values represent a worse outcome.</description>

    <measure>Desiring for sweet</measure>
    <time_frame>Three hours postprandial period</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective assessment of desire for specific food types was performed by using a visual analog scale (VAS) composed of lines (of 100 mm in length) with words anchored at each end, expressing the most positive and the most negative rating. VAS ratings were measured by using a question &quot;Would you like to eat something sweet? (No, not at all - Yes, very much)&quot; at time points 0, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 minutes, and desiring for sweet was quantified as AUC (mm x min), which was calculated according to the trapezoidal rule by using those VAS scores. Total scale score changes in a range of 0-100. Higher values represent a worse outcome.</description>
