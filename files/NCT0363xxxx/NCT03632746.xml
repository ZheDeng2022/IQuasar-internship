  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early gastric cancer is defined as gastric cancer that only invades mucosal or submucosal&#xD;
      layer. The 5-year survival rate of gastric cancer can exceed 90% due to appropriate&#xD;
      treatment. The most important consideration is whether there is lymph node metastasis.&#xD;
      Preoperative examination including gastroscopy, endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) and CT are&#xD;
      not accurate enough to predict lymph node metastasis in early gastric cancer. In a&#xD;
      retrospective study, we created a nomogram to predict lymph node metastasis in early gastric&#xD;
      cancer. In prospective validation, the sensitivity and specificity of the nomogram was 75%&#xD;
      and 91%, respectively. Sentinel lymph node is a promising concept in early gastric cancer.&#xD;
      Using carbon nanoparticles as tracer, the sensitivity and specificity of sentinel lymph node&#xD;
      predicting lymph node metastasis in early gastric cancer were 90% and 100%. Based on these&#xD;
      results, we proposed a new method that combines the Nomogram and sentinel lymph node to&#xD;
      predict lymph node metastasis in early gastric cancer. First, the probability of lymph node&#xD;
      metastasis of early gastric cancer patients is calculated by the Nomogram. Those with low&#xD;
      incidence of lymph node metastasis continue to the sentinel lymph node procedure. A patient&#xD;
      will be considered non lymph node metastasis if his/her frozen pathology of the sentinel&#xD;
      lymph nodes is negative during the surgery. Then the standard radical gastrectomy is&#xD;
      performed with lymphadenectomy. By comparing postoperative pathology and sentinel lymph node&#xD;
      frozen pathology, the specificity of Nomogram combining sentinel lymph node predicting lymph&#xD;
      node metastasis in early gastric patients is calculated. The primary endpoint of this&#xD;
      research is that the specificity of the above-mentioned method is over 95%.&#xD;
