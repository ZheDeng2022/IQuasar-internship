  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Failure to adequately diagnose and treat patients with functional popliteal artery entrapment&#xD;
      syndrome (PAES) leads to continued pain, loss of function and poor quality of life for many&#xD;
      patients nationwide. Currently, the primary treatment for functional PAES involves muscle&#xD;
      resection, sometimes involving large segments of muscle, which itself can lead to functional&#xD;
      impairment. As such, a less invasive treatment for functional PAES is desirable. The focus of&#xD;
      this work is to determine whether Botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) injections into the&#xD;
      gastrocnemius muscle can lessen the mechanical forces placed on the popliteal artery by the&#xD;
      involved muscle, thereby improving symptoms caused by impaired distal blood flow.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ten (10) patients with suspected functional popliteal artery entrapment syndrome will be&#xD;
      recruited for this study. Dr. Michael Fredericson will recruit patients from local sports&#xD;
      medicine clinics and sports teams. Equal men and women will be recruited, between the age of&#xD;
      18 and 50 years. This subcategory will reduce the potential of recruiting patients with&#xD;
      age-related confounding causes for their symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After patients have been identified as having clinical features suggestive of PAES,&#xD;
      confirmation of the diagnosis will involve the following in accordance with standards of&#xD;
      care: 1) Ankle-brachial index testing with provocative maneuvers (maximal passive&#xD;
      dorsiflexion and maximal active plantarflexion, treadmill running at a slope), 2) MRI&#xD;
      angiography with provocative maneuvers (maximal plantar and dorsiflexion).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will also complete at baseline a visual analog scale (VAS) of their pain, a&#xD;
      lower extremity functional scale (LEFS), and lower extremity ultrasound for evaluation of&#xD;
      gastrocnemius muscle size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, treatment of functional PAES involves surgical intervention frequently involving&#xD;
      resection of the gastrocnemius muscle. As part of this study, BTX-A will be administered to&#xD;
      the gastrocnemius. Patients will be informed about the indications, contraindications, and&#xD;
      adverse events associated with BTX-A injections, and they will be informed of current&#xD;
      standard of care options, including surgical intervention. Written consent will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dr. Michael Fredericson will carefully inject BTX-A (Dysport-Ipsen Inc.) into the proximal&#xD;
      third of the medial and lateral gastrocnemius muscles of the symptomatic leg(s). Total dose&#xD;
      per leg will be 400 units, 200 per injection site. Injections will be performed with the aid&#xD;
      of real-time ultrasound (Sonosite, Bothwell, WA) guidance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The premise of the intervention is that hypertrophy of the gastrocnemius muscle leads to&#xD;
      functional entrapment of the popliteal artery at the level of the popliteal fossa with&#xD;
      provocation maneuvers or exercise. By temporarily reducing muscle tone and promoting&#xD;
      localized atrophy through BTX-A-induced chemodenervation, this entrapment can be relieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measures for this study will be VAS scores, LEFS scores, findings of&#xD;
      improved blood flow on ABI with provocative maneuvers, and gastrocnemius size on ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patient's recruited to this study will have failed prior conservative treatment, and&#xD;
      therefore any improvements seen in symptoms from the BTX-A injection will be considered above&#xD;
      and beyond what was provided by conservative care. As such, each patient in this study design&#xD;
      acts as their own case control (i.e. there is no appropriate intervention and/or placebo&#xD;
      control group for these patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 1 month, 3 months and 6 months post-injection, patients will return for clinical&#xD;
      examination, visual analog scale (VAS) score, a lower extremity functional scale (LEFS), and&#xD;
      lower extremity ultrasound for evaluation of gastrocnemius muscle size.&#xD;
