      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of edetate calcium disodium or&#xD;
      succimer in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome&#xD;
      undergoing chemotherapy. Edetate calcium disodium or succimer may help to lower the level of&#xD;
      metals found in the bone marrow and blood and may help to control the disease and/or improve&#xD;
      response to chemotherapy.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To establish the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of Phase 1 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML)&#xD;
      and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients undergoing therapy combined with succimer (DMSA)&#xD;
      and edetate calcium disodium (Ca-EDTA). (Phase I dose escalation) II. To assess the efficacy&#xD;
      information regarding the combined therapy in terms of the overall response rate (ORR)&#xD;
      including complete remission (CR), CR with partial hematological recovery (CRh), CR with&#xD;
      incomplete count recovery (CRi), morphologic leukemia free state (MLFS), and partial&#xD;
      remission (PR). (Phase I dose escalation)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the complete remission (CR), complete remission with incomplete hematologic&#xD;
      recovery (CRi), complete remission with partial hematological recovery (CRh), partial&#xD;
      remission (PR), hematologic improvement (HI), morphologic leukemia free state (MLFS) rates&#xD;
      and the 1-year overall survival (OS) in AML patients and the CR/marrow CR/hematologic&#xD;
      improvement (HI) rate, partial remission (PR) rate and 1-year overall survival (OS) and 6-&#xD;
      month cytogenetic response in MDS patients undergoing MDS/AML therapy combined with DMSA and&#xD;
      Ca-EDTA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II.To assess overall survival and event free survival in AML and MDS patients undergoing AML&#xD;
      and MDS therapy combined with DMSA and Ca-EDTA III. To assess remission duration in AML and&#xD;
      MDS patients undergoing AML and MDS therapy combined with DMSA and Ca-EDTA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To monitor toxic and essential metal levels during AML and MDS therapy combined with DMSA&#xD;
      and Ca-EDTA and to evaluate the reduction in metals in the bone marrow and blood of newly&#xD;
      diagnosed AML and MDS patients undergoing metal detoxification combined with standard AML/MDS&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To evaluate the safety profile in AML and MDS patients undergoing AML and MDS therapy&#xD;
      combined with DMSA and Ca-EDTA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Correlate metal and copper isotopic abundance ratios of AML and MDS patients with&#xD;
      clinical data, conventional cytogenetics, extensive next generation sequencing (NGS)&#xD;
      (300-gene panel), exposure survey data, and clinical outcome data, and to perform a larger&#xD;
      analysis by pooling this data with metal/genomic/survey/outcome data obtained on 2017-0937&#xD;
      and PA15-0302.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. Estimate the progression rate in MDS patients. VIII. To assess other responses of&#xD;
      interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To correlate the degree of metal chelation with the degree of therapeutic response and&#xD;
      minimal residual disease (MRD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To collect environmental exposure data on the environmental health assessment survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess P53 folding before and after the first dose of Ca-EDTA chelation in MDS and&#xD;
      AML patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To study changes in cytogenetic/molecular data during treatment, as well as protein&#xD;
      expression data (by immunohistochemistry and/or proteomics) including for transcription&#xD;
      factors/tumor suppressors (e.g. TP53 and MYC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To perform pre-clinical proof of concept studies of metals and metal chelators in a&#xD;
      variety of AML cells and cell lines including: AML cell lines, primary hematologic malignancy&#xD;
      cells, stromal cell lines, and patient-derived stromal cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT I: During standard of care chemotherapy, patients receive edetate calcium disodium&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) daily over 30 minutes for 4 doses for each cycle. Treatment continues for&#xD;
      up to 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also&#xD;
      receive up to 12 multivitamin capsules PO daily while on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT II: During standard of care chemotherapy, patients receive succimer orally (PO) daily&#xD;
      for 8 or 21 days of each cycle beginning day 1. Treatment continues for up to 6 cycles in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive up to 12&#xD;
      multivitamin capsules PO daily while on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3-12 months for up to 10&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
