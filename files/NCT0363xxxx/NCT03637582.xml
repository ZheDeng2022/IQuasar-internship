    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate how urethral anesthesia impacts voiding efficiency&#xD;
      in healthy women. The investigator hypothesizes that anesthetizing the urethral with&#xD;
      lidocaine gel will decrease voiding efficiency as measured by standard bladder testing&#xD;
      (urodynamic testing).&#xD;

      1. Purpose of the Study&#xD;
&#xD;
           The purpose of this study is to determine whether urethral sensory feedback has a role&#xD;
           in the micturition (bladder emptying) reflex in female controls during routine office&#xD;
           Urodynamic Studies (UDS). UDS are current clinical tests of urethral and bladder&#xD;
           function and consist of several individual studies including filling cystometry,&#xD;
           pressure-flow studies, and urethral pressure profilometry (UPP). Filling cystometry&#xD;
           focuses primarily on sensation and activity of the bladder during the filling (or&#xD;
           storage) phase of the micturition (voiding) cycle. Pressure-flow studies (which include&#xD;
           voiding cystometry) are used to assess the motor activity of the bladder muscle during&#xD;
           bladder emptying. UPP assesses urethral sphincter motor function and has traditionally&#xD;
           been used to evaluate stress urinary incontinence. Perineal patch electromyography (EMG)&#xD;
           is often added to UDS to assess for pelvic floor muscle recruitment during voiding,&#xD;
           which may suggest voiding dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Background &amp; Significance&#xD;
&#xD;
           The storage and elimination of urine is regulated by neural circuits in the brain and&#xD;
           spinal cord to coordinate function between the urinary bladder and the urethra (Fowler,&#xD;
           Griffiths et al. 2008). During the micturition (bladder emptying) reflex, the&#xD;
           elimination of urine is facilitated by bladder wall contraction and urethral wall and&#xD;
           pelvic floor muscle relaxation. Urine that subsequently flows through the urethra also&#xD;
           activates sensory nerves to amplify bladder contractions and maintain efficient bladder&#xD;
           emptying (Jung, Fraser et al. 1999, Bump 2000). Incomplete voiding and urinary retention&#xD;
           occurs when these mechanisms are disrupted or poorly coordinated.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Incomplete bladder emptying due to detrusor underactivity is an understudied health&#xD;
           concern for women in the United States. The overall incidence of detrusor underactivity&#xD;
           in women has not yet been reported in the literature. One study by Wu et al. (2005)&#xD;
           determined that 7.8% of patients in an outpatient rehabilitation facility had symptoms&#xD;
           of incomplete bladder emptying; whereas, 21% of people without symptoms had elevated&#xD;
           post void residuals when universally screened. Their population consisted of 350&#xD;
           patients, of which two-thirds were women. Lower urinary tract symptoms, including&#xD;
           urinary urgency, frequency and incomplete bladder emptying, have been shown to decrease&#xD;
           quality of life, increase healthcare utilization, decrease workplace productivity, and&#xD;
           impact intimate relationships (Richter et al. 2007, Coyne et al. 2003).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The current clinical management options for women with retention are intermittent or&#xD;
           indwelling catheterization, urethral dilation, or reconstructive surgery (Mevcha and&#xD;
           Drake 2010). These treatments, however, often fail to completely resolve lower urinary&#xD;
           tract symptoms and the patients may develop chronic retention complications such as&#xD;
           overflow incontinence, hydroureter, hydronephrosis, infection, or renal failure. In&#xD;
           order to improve therapeutic outcomes, there is still a need to clarify the specific&#xD;
           mechanisms that underlie detrusor underactivity in women. Our proposed studies will be&#xD;
           contributing to the growing body of literature implicating urethral sensory feedback as&#xD;
           a candidate to recover efficient bladder emptying.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Hypothesis and Justification&#xD;
&#xD;
           Overall Hypothesis: Urethral afferent nerve fiber activation augments bladder&#xD;
           contractions for efficient voiding and urethral anesthesia will disrupt sensory feedback&#xD;
           and impair bladder emptying.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Specific Aim 1: To assess voiding efficiency (voided volume/{voided volume + residual&#xD;
           volume}) in women controls with and without urethral anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypothesis 1a: Voiding efficiency will be lower when the urethra is anesthetized during&#xD;
           uroflow studies&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypothesis 1b: Detrusor contraction at maximum flow rate (Pdet@Qmax) and duration of&#xD;
           detrusor contraction will be reduced when the urethra is anesthetized during micturition&#xD;
           pressure-flow studies&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypothesis 1c: Voiding while anesthetized will lead to increased valsalva-voiding&#xD;
           (increased intra-abdominal pressure, Pabd) and an intermittent urinary stream during&#xD;
           micturition pressure-flow studies&#xD;
&#xD;
           Specific Aim 2: To assess whether urethral anesthesia gel improves discomfort during the&#xD;
           UDS&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypothesis 2a: Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores for pain will be lower during the UDS&#xD;
           when the urethra has been anesthetized&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Studies Supporting Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
           i. Micturition with Urethral Anesthesia: Distension and fluid flow in the urethra has&#xD;
           been previously demonstrated to evoke sensory nerve discharge. Nerve firing originating&#xD;
           from the urethra is then able to initiate contractions in the filling bladder and&#xD;
           increase the amplitude and duration of ongoing bladder contractions. This&#xD;
           pudendal-bladder reflex has been shown to be necessary for efficient bladder emptying&#xD;
           because disruption to urethral sensory feedback by transection of the sensory branch of&#xD;
           the pudendal nerve or intraurethral anesthesia reduces voiding efficiency in the rat.&#xD;
           Urethral anesthesia in humans has also been demonstrated to increase post void residual&#xD;
           and alter symptoms experienced during the voiding phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
           This investigator's approach is novel as this study will characterize voiding in healthy&#xD;
           women who will be randomized to placebo versus urethral anesthesia. Investigators will&#xD;
           do this by performing UDS, which will include all clinical tests for bladder function,&#xD;
           with or without urethral anesthesia (4% lidocaine hydrochloride gel or plain aqueous&#xD;
           gel).&#xD;
&#xD;
           ii. Pain Perception During Catheterization: Urethral catheterization elicits mild to&#xD;
           moderate pain in women. The use of lubricant anesthetic on the catheter is one available&#xD;
           option to manage tissue trauma and pain perception. Several studies have reported that&#xD;
           4% lidocaine gel reduces procedural pain during female urethral catheterization. Others&#xD;
           however, have found that lubricant anesthetic and catheter size, does not effect the&#xD;
           perception of pain in urethral catheterization in women. These discrepant reports&#xD;
           suggest a consensus has not been reached on the efficacy of lubricant anesthetic and&#xD;
           pain perception in women.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Subject Recruitment: Subjects will be recruited from Duke Hospital and Duke University&#xD;
           Campus via newspaper advertisements and paper fliers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Design and Procedures: To account for screen failures, it is anticipated that a total of&#xD;
           30 female controls will be screened to achieve n=20 for completed UDS. Participants will&#xD;
           be randomized to their arm of the study using a random number generator. Study staff and&#xD;
           the subjects will be blinded to the treatment regimen; thus, our study design is a&#xD;
           randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visit Questionnaires and Tests: After their phone screen, participants will be&#xD;
      scheduled for the study visit. All study procedures will take place at the Duke Urogynecology&#xD;
      Office at Patterson Place. Participants will undergo informed consent on arrival to their&#xD;
      study visit. They will provide a urine specimen for a point of care urinalysis and pregnancy&#xD;
      test. Pre-procedure vital signs, including height and weight will be obtained. They will fill&#xD;
      out the following questionnaires: Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms Tool, Sociodemographics and&#xD;
      Functional Comorbidity Index and complete a Medication List.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If subjects have a negative urinalysis and pregnancy test they will undergo examination to&#xD;
      ensure no evidence of pelvic organ prolapse. A baseline uroflow study will then be performed.&#xD;
      The subject will be instructed to void on a commode chair. A post void residual urine&#xD;
      measurement will be performed via a bladder scanner. The subject will then complete a&#xD;
      baseline VAS. Provided the subject has a normal baseline uroflow and no reported pain on&#xD;
      baseline VAS, the subject will be randomized to an arm (lidocaine or aqueous gel first) of&#xD;
      the urodynamic study. If either of their point of care tests is positive (per exclusion&#xD;
      criteria), they will be excluded from the study and referred to their primary care physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to performing UDS, the subject's bladder will be scanned transabdominally with a&#xD;
      standard clinic bladder scanner. This will ensure adequate urine is within the bladder prior&#xD;
      to beginning. If the subject has &gt; 250mL and &lt; 650mL in their bladder, they will proceed to&#xD;
      the UDS procedure room. If the subject has &lt; 250 mL, they will be given a bottle of water and&#xD;
      will return to the waiting room for 15-30 minutes. Adequate urine volume will again be&#xD;
      confirmed via bladder scanning. Urodynamic testing will then begin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Order of Studies Performed During Urodynamic Testing: Complex Uroflowmetry, Complex&#xD;
      Cystometry, Urethral Pressure Profilometry, Micturition Pressure-flow Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) will be administered to assess discomfort at the following&#xD;
      times; after uroflow but before PVR (for baseline and the second study condition uroflow),&#xD;
      immediately after the urethral catheter is placed, after 100mL of fluid has been instilled,&#xD;
      and at full bladder capacity (MCC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the completion of both UDS procedures, participants will be given standard&#xD;
      Urogynecology post urodynamics instructions.&#xD;
