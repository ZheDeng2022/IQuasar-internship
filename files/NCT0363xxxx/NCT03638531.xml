  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the proposed research is to determine the influence of transcranial direct&#xD;
      current stimulation (tDCS) on long-term motor learning, transfer of motor learning, and&#xD;
      cortical function in Parkinson's disease (PD). The project comprises a 2 week training study&#xD;
      that will involve tDCS applied during two practice motor tasks with behavioral, clinical, and&#xD;
      physiological evaluations at baseline as well as 1, 14 and 28 days following the 2 week&#xD;
      training and stimulation period. The findings of the proposed studies should have significant&#xD;
      clinical significance and applications to comprehensive intervention therapy development in&#xD;
      the treatment of PD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder and affects&#xD;
      approximately 1 million people in the United States with total annual costs approaching 11&#xD;
      billion dollars. Current medical and surgical treatment approaches for PD are either only&#xD;
      mildly effective, expensive, or associated with a variety of side effects. Therefore, the&#xD;
      development of practical and effective therapeutic adjuncts to current treatment approaches&#xD;
      would have significant benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique&#xD;
      that can modulate cortical excitability and improve motor function in healthy subjects, older&#xD;
      adults, and in stroke. However, there are several crucial issues that currently prevents the&#xD;
      determination of the viability of tDCS as an adjunct intervention in PD. For example, the&#xD;
      magnitude to which tDCS may be able to improve long-term motor learning beyond what can be&#xD;
      achieved by practice alone in PD is unknown. It is also unclear if short-term improvements in&#xD;
      motor function induced by tDCS and measured in the OFF state in PD can be attained over the&#xD;
      long-term in the ON state, which is necessary for real world application. In addition, it is&#xD;
      uncertain if the effects of tDCS generalize to non-practiced tasks and to the ipsilateral,&#xD;
      non-tDCS stimulated hand. Finally, the physiological mechanisms underlying any of these&#xD;
      issues have not been identified because no long-term motor learning tDCS studies in PD to&#xD;
      date have concurrently quantified behavioral, clinical, and physiological measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will be a single-center, double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled, experimental&#xD;
      design. PD patients will practice 2 motor tasks (practice tasks) with their right (primarily&#xD;
      affected) hand in 9 practice sessions over a 2 week period in association with either tDCS or&#xD;
      SHAM stimulation of the left (contralateral) motor cortex. In addition, 4 testing sessions&#xD;
      will be performed and will include a Baseline test, an end of training test (EOT), a follow&#xD;
      up test 2 weeks after the end of training (EOT+14), and a follow up test 4 weeks after the&#xD;
      end of training (EOT+28). The primary outcome variables will be the force error in the first&#xD;
      practice task (precision grip task; PGT) and the stroke amplitude, stroke variability, and&#xD;
      writing speed in the second practice task (handwriting task; HWT). The secondary outcome&#xD;
      variables the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part 3, the Purdue Pegboard&#xD;
      Test (PT), and the Jebsen Taylor Hand Function Test (JTT).&#xD;
