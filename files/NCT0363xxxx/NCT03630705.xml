&#xD;
        1. To describe the antibody titers to the antigens (meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and&#xD;
           W) present in MenACYW conjugate vaccine or Menveo® measured by serum bactericidal assay&#xD;
           using human complement (hSBA), for Groups 1 and 2 when administered concomitantly with&#xD;
           routine pediatric vaccines in healthy infants and toddlers in Mexico&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To describe the antibody titers to the antigens (meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and&#xD;
           W) present in MenACYW conjugate vaccine measured by hSBA, for Group 3, when administered&#xD;
           concomitantly with routine pediatric vaccines in healthy infants and toddlers in the&#xD;
           Russian Federation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To describe the hSBA vaccine seroresponse to the antigens (meningococcal serogroups A,&#xD;
           C, Y, and W) for Groups 1 and 2, 30 days after the last vaccination of the infant series&#xD;
           (Dose 2 of MenACYW conjugate vaccine and Dose 3 of Menveo®), when administered&#xD;
           concomitantly with routine pediatric vaccines in healthy infants and toddlers in Mexico&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To describe the hSBA vaccine seroresponse to the antigens (meningococcal serogroups A,&#xD;
           C, Y, and W) for Group 3, 30 days after the last vaccination of the infant series (Dose&#xD;
           2 of MenACYW conjugate vaccine), when administered concomitantly with routine pediatric&#xD;
