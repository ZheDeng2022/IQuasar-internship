    <textblock>
      Children with functional constipation according to the Rome IV criteria will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to receive prunes at dose 3.5 g/kg/d (prune group) or Polyethylene Glycol 4000 (PEG&#xD;
      group) at dose 0.5 g/kg/d for 4 weeks. Before treatment children with impaction will receive&#xD;
      PEG 4000 at the dose 1.5 g/kg for 3-5 consecutive days. The primary outcome measure will be&#xD;
      treatment success, defined as ≥3 BM per week with no fecal soiling during last week of the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;

      We will conduct a randomized open-label trial at the Department of Paediatrics of the Medical&#xD;
      University of Warsaw. The trial will be initiated by the investigators and conducted&#xD;
      independently of any commercial entities. The aim will be to assess the effectiveness of&#xD;
      dried prunes in the management of functional constipation in children in comparison to PEG&#xD;
      4000. Patients will be included into our study when functional constipation will be diagnosed&#xD;
      according to ROME IV criteria. Those patients which will meet inclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      assigned randomly to receive prunes at dose 3,5 g/kg/d in three portions a day, for 4 weeks&#xD;
      (amount of prescribed prunes will be calibrated with the weight that child ought to have on&#xD;
      WHO growth charts at 50th percentile) or PEG 4000 at dose 0,5 g/kg/d once daily orally, for 4&#xD;
      weeks. Parents of the children allocated to the prunes group will receive written information&#xD;
      from dietician how to introduce prunes into child's diet (i.e. prunes should be introduced&#xD;
      every day in three meals; prunes can be chopped or grinded before eating them; prunes can be&#xD;
      eaten alone or child may eat them as a part of bigger meal (which is prefered version);&#xD;
      prunes can be introduced with yoghurt, cereals, nuts and seeds as a morning meal). All&#xD;
      patients will be asked to discontinue any laxatives if they used them previously. In case of&#xD;
      rectal impaction noted on physical examination, PEG 4000 at dose of 1.5 g/kg for 3-5&#xD;
      consecutive days will be recommended. All subjects parents will receive a stool diary to&#xD;
      record the frequency of bowel movements; stool consistency according to Bristol Stool Form&#xD;
      Scale (which refers to 7 pictures of different forms of stool; 1 for hard lumps to 7 for&#xD;
      watery stools); frequency of episodes of fecal soiling, pain during defecation, or abdominal&#xD;
      pain or flatulence; use of additional laxative treatment; and adverse effects during the 4&#xD;
      weeks of the intervention. All patients or their parents (if child is too young) will be&#xD;
      asked to write down selfreported 3 day food diaries on non-consecutive days, 2 d during the&#xD;
      week and 1 d during the weekend to assess fiber intake during the study period .. All&#xD;
      patients will be informed of rescue therapy -when there will be no defecation for 3&#xD;
      consecutive days during ongoing trail, PEG 4000 will be allowed at the dose of 1.5 g/kg/d&#xD;
      until the child will pass a stool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study period, every week investigator will call the patients parents to assess&#xD;
      compliance with the study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second visit will take place at the end of the trial (4th week). During this visit,&#xD;
      investigators will collect stool diaries. Prunes used in the study will be purchased by&#xD;
      parents of the children. It will be advised for parents to buy prunes under the trade mark of&#xD;
      &quot;Makar&quot; in order to avoid product composition variability bias. Choice of the trade mark was&#xD;
      taken considering the price of a product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed as a randomized, open label controlled trial with 1:1 allocation. In&#xD;
      order to obtain comparable groups, block randomisation will be performed (each block will&#xD;
      contain four patients: two in the intervention group and two in the control group). The&#xD;
      randomisation list will be generated using the statistical program StatsDirect by an&#xD;
      independent person and will be kept by a staff member not involved in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on available data in the literature, we assume that a clinically significant difference&#xD;
      in the effectiveness is 15%. To detect such a difference between the study groups with a&#xD;
      power of 80% and alpha of 5%, a sample of 100 children is needed. Assuming approximately 10%&#xD;
      loss to follow-up, we aim to recruit a total of 110 children for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Ethical Committee of the Medical University of Warsaw will be asked for approval for the&#xD;
      study before recruitment commenced. Any modifications to the protocol that may affect the&#xD;
      conduct of the study will be presented to the Ethical Committee. Verbal and written&#xD;
      information regarding informed consent will be presented to the caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All analysis will be conducted on an intention-to-treat basis, including all patients in the&#xD;
      groups to which they are randomized for whom outcomes are available (including drop-outs and&#xD;
      withdrawals). Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize baseline characteristics. The&#xD;
      Student t test will be used to compare mean values of continuous variables for approximating&#xD;
      a normal distribution. For non normally distributed variables, the Mann-Whitney U test will&#xD;
      be used. The chi-square or Fisher exact test will be used, when appropriate, to compare&#xD;
      percentages. For continuous outcomes, differences in means or differences in medians&#xD;
      (depending on the distribution of the data), and for dichotomous outcomes, the RR and number&#xD;
      needed to treat, all with a 95% CI, will be calculated. The difference between study groups&#xD;
      will be considered significant when the 95% CI for RR does not include 1.0, or when the 95%&#xD;
      CI for MD does not include 0. All statistical tests will be 2-tailed and performed at the 5%&#xD;
      level of significance.&#xD;
