  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study in healthy volunteers.&#xD;
      Twenty four subjects will be enrolled in the study and will be assigned to receive either a&#xD;
      16 mg afamelanotide bioresorbable implant from the current manufacturing process or a 16 mg&#xD;
      afamelanotide bioresorbable implant from the optimized manufacturing process. Implants will&#xD;
      be administered subcutaneously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following procedures will be conducted throughout the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collection of blood samples for analysis of afamelanotide concentrations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurement of skin reflectance for estimation of melanin density, and luminance (L*),&#xD;
           blue/yellow colour hue (b*)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety monitoring&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the proposed study is to confirm that the pharmacokinetic and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic properties of implants eluting 16 mg of afamelanotide produced by this final&#xD;
      optimized manufacturing process are essentially the same as those of implants manufactured&#xD;
      with the same formulation that have been used in earlier clinical studies&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will involve the use of an implant, which comes in the form of a small rod to be&#xD;
      administered under the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study, afamelanotide has been formulated as a controlled release depot injection&#xD;
      (implant). This means that the afamelanotide will be released slowly into the body over a few&#xD;
      days. Once inserted, the implant will remain in the body after afamelanotide has been&#xD;
      released and will slowly dissolve.&#xD;
