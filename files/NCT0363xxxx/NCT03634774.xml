  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Enhancing the mealtime experience through changing the social and physical aspects of dining&#xD;
      holds the potential to not only improve food intake among residents, but enhance their&#xD;
      quality of life. The CHOICE+ Program is designed to support relationship-centred mealtimes in&#xD;
      long-term care (LTC). This current study will pilot the CHOICE+ Program over the course of 18&#xD;
      months in three LTC homes with the support of a single external facilitator. The research&#xD;
      team will collect data at mealtimes and from staff, residents and family members to determine&#xD;
      what changes occurred and how this impacted the mealtime experience. The results of this&#xD;
      study will provide insight into the efficacy of the CHOICE+ Program and if the program holds&#xD;
      potential to improve mealtimes for residents in LTC through relationship-centered dining, as&#xD;
      well as capacity building among those who live and work in the home to identify areas for&#xD;
      improvement and work together to make change.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study employs a stepped wedged design that includes three long-term care homes (Site A,&#xD;
      Site B, Site C) located within Southern Ontario. Each LTC home will have approximately 12&#xD;
      months to implement the CHOICE+ Program and demonstrate sustainability for the last few&#xD;
      weeks; the study will run for 18 months due to the staggered entry of sites into the&#xD;
      intervention (Site A: Month 1; Site B: Month 4; Site C: Month 7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the course of 12 months for each Site, the CHOICE+ Program components will be delivered&#xD;
      to a single care unit using a 4-phase approach. Transitions from one phase to the next will&#xD;
      be entirely dependent upon the context and readiness of those participants involved in the&#xD;
      study (i.e., timing between phases may differ amongst LTC homes). A single external&#xD;
      facilitator from the University of Waterloo will lead this implementation process. The&#xD;
      principal investigator (PI; H. Keller) will assist in guiding the external facilitator&#xD;
      through the implementation process and support debriefing sessions. A blinded trained&#xD;
      assessor will conduct mealtime experience audits (Mealtime Scan Plus) every 12 weeks starting&#xD;
      at Month 1 for Sites A, B, and C, regardless of the implementation start times (i.e., Site A&#xD;
      at Month 1; Site B and Month 4; Site C and Month 7). A physical dining room audit will be&#xD;
      conducted at four time points (Dining Environment Audit Protocol). Staff, resident and&#xD;
      family/volunteer dining experience questionnaires will be completed at four time points as&#xD;
      well. Below is sequential description of the implementation process of the CHOICE+ Program in&#xD;
      a single site, while accounting for pre-implementation activities:&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE 1: PRE-DEVELOPMENT (Week 0)&#xD;
&#xD;
      - PI and facilitator meets with LTC home management/administrators (i.e., Unit Care&#xD;
      Coordinators (UCC), Director of Food Service (DFS), Registered Dietitian (RD), and General&#xD;
      Manager (GM)) to describe purpose of CHOICE+ Program, address questions and ensure&#xD;
      commitment. Once roles and responsibilities are discussed and agreed upon, the researchers&#xD;
      will tour the care unit to obtain an understanding of specific contextual factors. A CHOICE+&#xD;
      Newsletter item for residents, family, and volunteers will be distributed to raise awareness&#xD;
      of the program. A CHOICE+ Information Letter will be distributed to all staff members,&#xD;
      posters with information session dates and times will be posted, and information brochures&#xD;
      will be available around the care unit for care staff, residents, family members, and&#xD;
      volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE 2: DEVELOPMENT (Week 1 - Week 8)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weeks 1-2: In-services and/or informal connections made by the external facilitator to&#xD;
           raise awareness and promote the CHOICE+ Program among care staff, residents, family&#xD;
           members, and volunteers on the care unit. Feedback and knowledge exchange with care unit&#xD;
           will be sought during these information sessions to gain contextual understanding of&#xD;
           specific needs of that care unit's mealtimes.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  MTS+ Audit 1 data collection by assessor using Mealtime Scan for Long-Term Care&#xD;
                PLUS (MTS+), a validated tool to assess the psychosocial and physical environments&#xD;
                of a mealtime. Prior to the start of MTS+ Data Collection, posters notifying&#xD;
                residents, staff, family members, and volunteers that observations are taking place&#xD;
                will be posted in the dining areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The Dining Environment Audit Protocol (DEAP) is completed when the dining room is&#xD;
                empty.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Week 3: CHOICE+ Dining Team (CDT) that includes residents, family members, care staff&#xD;
           (minimum 2), volunteers (if available on unit), and management (minimum 1) will be&#xD;
           formed to work closely with external facilitator and care unit to identify aspects of&#xD;
           mealtimes that need improvement and support. Two Mealtime Champions (MT Champions) will&#xD;
           be identified by the group and/or management as leaders and will act as the key contacts&#xD;
           for the facilitator. As part of the team building process and to raise awareness, the&#xD;
           CDT will complete a questionnaire about their organization's readiness to make change.&#xD;
           As this is a change management step, an information letter and consent for will not be&#xD;
           used. The Team Mealtime Experience Questionnaire (TMEQ) will be administered by the&#xD;
           facilitator to participating care staff to reflect upon their role in the dining room&#xD;
           during meals after informed written consent is provided. Residents, family members, and&#xD;
           volunteers will have the option of completing a Dining Experience Questionnaire (DEQ) to&#xD;
           share their feelings about mealtimes on the care unit. A separate questionnaire will be&#xD;
           available for residents and family members/volunteers and informed written consent or&#xD;
           assent in the event the resident is unable to sign a consent form will be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weeks 4-8: Training and equipping the CDT on CHOICE+ Principles and change management&#xD;
           approaches will take place over 4 meetings hosted by the external facilitator. The&#xD;
           themes of these meetings include Meeting #1: CDT Role and CHOICE+ Program overview;&#xD;
           Meeting #2: CHOICE+ Education Modules; Meeting #3: Feedback of Audit 1 MTS+, TMEQ, DEAP,&#xD;
           and DEQ results. Results will be shared first with the CDT then with the rest of the&#xD;
           care unit for review and reflection using the most appropriate communication methods&#xD;
           identified by the CDT (i.e., bulletin boards, huddles, posters, etc.); and Meeting #4:&#xD;
           Process of making change and priority setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE 3: INTENSIVE (Weeks 9-36)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weeks 9-10: All care staff on the unit and those residents and family members who are&#xD;
           interested in participating in CHOICE+, in addition to the CDT, will complete the&#xD;
           CHOICE+ Education Modules (mobile based short videos). In situations where there are new&#xD;
           members of the care unit (i.e., care staff, residents and their family members) will&#xD;
           also be provided with this education.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weeks 9-12: CDT engages with broader care unit to share Audit 1 MTS+, DEAP, TMEQ, and&#xD;
           DEQ results to obtain feedback. Communication methods that are most suited to the care&#xD;
           unit, for example, posters, meetings, bulletin boards, etc., will be used to share these&#xD;
           audit findings. The CDT will engage with the broader care unit to select those mealtime&#xD;
           areas for improvement that are most important to neighbours, care staff, and family&#xD;
           members.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weeks 12-36: The CDT will take these priority areas and work as a team to identify how&#xD;
           to make changes and improvements using a variety of behaviour change techniques using a&#xD;
           Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycle framework. Once a practice change is becoming embedded, a&#xD;
           new priority for improvement will be worked through by the CDT and PDSA cycles used to&#xD;
           test the improvement. The CDT will be responsible for on-going monitoring of the PDSA&#xD;
           cycles in the care unit with support from the facilitator until Week 36 where the&#xD;
           facilitator will then begin to reduce their role and the CDT will take on full&#xD;
           leadership of the changes being made on the care unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data collection will using the TMEQ, MTS+, DEAP, and DEQ will follow a schedule for all&#xD;
           three sites (see below in &quot;Data Collection&quot;) with results fed back to the CDT and the&#xD;
           unit team to support change in practice. Mealtime Practices Checklist and Dining Room&#xD;
           Checklist will be used as change management activities and self-reflection by the CDT&#xD;
           and unit team. As use of these checklists is part of the change process directed by the&#xD;
           CDT, informed consent will not be used prior to completion and if forms are collected&#xD;
           they will be anonymous for summarization and discussion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE 4: SUSTAINING (WEEKS 37-52)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Week 37-52: The sustaining phase will involve ensuring that any new care staff,&#xD;
           residents and their family members have access to the CHOICE+ Education Modules. CDT&#xD;
           will continue to work the process of change by identifying what needs to improve, how to&#xD;
           make the change and completing small tests with PDSA cycles to work through the&#xD;
           improvement or new process. DEAP, MTS+, TMEQ, and DEQ results will continue to be&#xD;
           provided to the CDT to support change practices and they will continue to use the&#xD;
           Mealtime Practices Checklist and other informal self-monitoring data to embed changes.&#xD;
           The CDT will continue to hold weekly meetings to monitor the progress of the PDSA cycles&#xD;
           and make any necessary modifications to the action plan or its implementation&#xD;
           strategies. The facilitator will help the CDT to develop a sustainability plan for the&#xD;
           CHOICE+ Program, after which the facilitator will remove herself from the care unit and&#xD;
           limit communication either via phone or email with the CDT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data collection will using TMEQ, MTS+, DEAP, and DEQ will follow a schedule for all&#xD;
           three sites (see below) with results fed back to the CDT and the unit tem to support&#xD;
           change in practice. Mealtime Practices Checklist and Dining Room Checklist will be used&#xD;
           as change management activities and self-reflection by the CDT and unit team.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Week 48-52: External facilitator will complete key informant semi-structured interviews&#xD;
           with CDT members including care staff home management residents family members), and&#xD;
           volunteers on the CHOICE+ program. It is anticipated than between 10-15 interviews will&#xD;
           be conducted at each site. Standard informed consent/assent process will be followed for&#xD;
           each potential interview participant.&#xD;
