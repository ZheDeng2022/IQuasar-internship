      A Randomized Control Trial will be conducted with Independent old adults (age 70 years old&#xD;
      and older) who willing to participate in the study. They will be randomly allocated to two&#xD;
      groups: 1) Stationary bicycle riding that includes perturbation balance training during&#xD;
      riding; 2) Stationary bicycle riding that does not includes perturbation balance training&#xD;
      during riding. Balance and Gait assessments will be tested before and after 3 months of&#xD;
      training (2-3 times a week).&#xD;

      Falls and fall-related injuries are common elder health problems. Falls are the leading cause&#xD;
      of fatal and nonfatal injuries among older adults, reducing mobility and independence, and&#xD;
      increase the risk of death. Between 30 to 40% of the community-dwelling older persons fall at&#xD;
      least once a year, usually by falling sideways that is resulting in 95% of hip fractures. In&#xD;
      the U.S. in 2014, the estimated direct medical costs for fall-related injuries were $31.3&#xD;
      billion and is expected to reach $67.7 billion by 2030 Age-related changes in the balance&#xD;
      control system increase the risk of falls. Execute a rapid step, whether voluntary or&#xD;
      compensatory, is the most important balance strategy to prevent a fall. In voluntary stepping&#xD;
      test, the foot contact times (i.e., stepping time) and reaction time (initiation phase) were&#xD;
      able to predict future fall and injury from fall. Studies of the reactive postural control&#xD;
      have shown that older adults initiate stepping at lower levels of instability, use multiple&#xD;
      steps, experience leg collisions or fail to recover balance compared to younger adults. The&#xD;
      Medio-Lateral center of pressure sway range with Eyes Closed is the best single predictor for&#xD;
      future fall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies showed that older adults were able to adapt in a reactive manner after participation&#xD;
      in a Perturbations based balance training (PBBT) that challenged the mechanisms responsible&#xD;
      for dynamic stability. These studies also showed a reducing in rate of falls and diverse&#xD;
      risks of falls in older adults (voluntary stepping times, balance control in standing and&#xD;
      walking, improved function and reduced fear of falls). however, in these studies the training&#xD;
      devices and programs were designed to participants who able to walk independently the whole&#xD;
      training sessions, lasting 20-45 minutes each and appropriate only for a small portion of the&#xD;
      general elderly population. In fact, in 2014 in U.S., the community-dwelling older persons&#xD;
      that reported a fall were divided equally into three health status: poor-fair, good, very&#xD;
      good-excellent with 33% rate of fall each subgroup. This fact motivates us to provide&#xD;
      accessibility PBBT for a wider range of the elderly population, and not for the &quot;strongest&quot;&#xD;
      older subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inspired by the well-known health advantages of cycling and the medio-lateral postural&#xD;
      control demand during two-wheel bicycle riding, encourage us to conduct a preliminary study&#xD;
      for feasibility. In this study we found older adults who aged with bicycle riding habits have&#xD;
      benefits in reactive and predictive aspects of postural control mechanisms (particularly in&#xD;
      the medio-lateral postural control) while standing and stepping, both related to risk of&#xD;
      falling in the elderly (see Preliminary result section). Because the special importance of&#xD;
      the medio-lateral balance control for preventing lateral falls and hip fractures in old age,&#xD;
      considering our preliminary findings, we hypothesize that following exposure to training&#xD;
      program that includes unexpected perturbations exercises during cycling will significantly&#xD;
      improve compensatory and voluntary stepping times as well as the medio-lateral balance&#xD;
      control in older adults, factors that are associated with falls and fall- related injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: firstly, to explore whether training while riding a new bicycle simulator device&#xD;
      providing unexpected perturbations can reduce risks of falls in standing and walking in&#xD;
      independent older adults. Secondly, if so, to examine this bicycle simulator device providing&#xD;
      unexpected perturbations method in a wider range of elderly subjects (i.e., who do not walk&#xD;
      independently or walk for only short distances or with assisted devices or suffering from&#xD;
      fear of falling or in pre-walking rehabilitative phases after stroke or other morbidity).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Study design: A double blinded randomized controlled trial. Participants: Relatively&#xD;
      healthy Community dwelling older adults that are 70 years or older, independent in daily&#xD;
      living activities, walking without assistive devices, without morbidity that influence&#xD;
      balance performance. The study will be approved by the Helsinki committee of Barzilai&#xD;
      University medical center, Ashkelon, Israel. All subjects will sign an informed consent&#xD;
      statement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training programs: We will use two identical exercise bicycles, one will remain a stationary&#xD;
      Bicycle device for the control group, and bicycle simulator device providing unexpected&#xD;
      perturbations during a bicycle simulator riding for the experimental group. The intervention&#xD;
      Group will receive 24 bicycle simulator device providing unexpected perturbations sessions,&#xD;
      twice a week for 12 weeks (about 20 min. each). The subjects will be instructed to &quot;ride on&#xD;
      the bicycle in your preferred pace and try to stabilize yourself&quot;. To prevent injury if loss&#xD;
      of balance occurred during the cycling, the subject will wear a loose safety harness that can&#xD;
      arrest the fall. The bicycle simulator device providing unexpected perturbations program will&#xD;
      have 24 levels of difficulty with increasing levels of perturbations (i.e., increase&#xD;
      displacement, velocity and accelerations of the translations). The control group will receive&#xD;
      24 sessions, twice a week for 12 weeks, about 20 minutes' bicycle riding on the stationary&#xD;
      device, pedaling in subject own preferred pace without perturbations and wearing a loose&#xD;
      safety harnesses. Since both group will train on two identical exercise bicycles, they will&#xD;
      be blinded to the allocation to intervention or control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments: 1) Compensatory Step Execution tests during Standing and Walking: The subjects&#xD;
      will be instructed to react naturally. Ten perturbation levels will be induced through a&#xD;
      device that provides controlled and unexpected anterior-posterior and medio-lateral platform&#xD;
      translations during a single belt treadmill in standing and walking. Four directional&#xD;
      perturbations (right/left/forward/backward) in a random order each level for a total of 40&#xD;
      perturbation trials. Kinematic analysis: Three-dimensional kinematic data will be collected&#xD;
      through the optical motion capture, providing kinematic analysis of a motion sequence.&#xD;
      Sixteen infrared cameras are covered the lab space sample simultaneously, at frequency of 200&#xD;
      Hz, the location of 35 reflective markers placed on anatomical landmarks of the body and&#xD;
      another two on the moving platform. The following Balance compensatory kinematics parameters:&#xD;
      (1) Platform perturbation; (2) First Step initiation time (milliseconds); (3) Foot contact&#xD;
      time (milliseconds); (4) Compensatory Step execution time (milliseconds); (5) Step swing time&#xD;
      (milliseconds); (6) Step length (centimeters); (7) End of Compensatory steps time&#xD;
      (milliseconds); (8) Total distance center of mass made (centimeters); (9) Distance of center&#xD;
      of mass from leg at the step-beginning point (centimeters); 10) Arms lift initiation times&#xD;
      (milliseconds); 11) Maximal arms swing amplitude/length (centimeters); 12) Arms swing times&#xD;
      (milliseconds). Observational analysis: observing each trail video and identifying the&#xD;
      compensatory reactions (see preliminary results). 2) Voluntary Step Execution Test:&#xD;
      Participants are instructed to voluntary step as quickly as possible following a&#xD;
      somatosensory cue, given randomly on one of their feet. A total of 8 trials will be conducted&#xD;
      in singe task and dual task conditions (while performing the modified Stroop task). Specific&#xD;
      temporal events were extracted from the step execution data: (a) Reaction Time; (b) Foot&#xD;
      Contact Time; (c) Preparation Time; (d) Swing Time. 3) Postural Stability: The subjects will&#xD;
      be instructed to stand barefoot as still as possible on the force platform in a standardized&#xD;
      stance. Five 30-s quiet-standing trials with eyes open and five trails with eyes blindfolded.&#xD;
      Evaluation of balance control will be made using both, traditional measure of postural sway&#xD;
      (e.g. medio-lateral-sway, anterior-posterior -sway, sway velocity, and sway area), and&#xD;
      calculating the Stabilogram-Diffusion Analysis parameters from center of pressure data. In&#xD;
      addition, clinical measurements and questionnaires will be conducted as the secondary outcome&#xD;
      measures: Berg Balance Scale (BBS); 6-minute walk test (6MWT); Medical History form; Late&#xD;
      Life Function and Disability Instrument (LLFDI); Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES);&#xD;
      Mini Mental state examination (MMSE).&#xD;
