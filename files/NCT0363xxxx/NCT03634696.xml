  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This work aims to improve late-stage cancer patients' access to high quality,&#xD;
      patient-centered symptom assessment and control via the creation, field test, and outcomes&#xD;
      assessment of a scalable mobile application (mPalliative Care Link; mPCL)-built around a&#xD;
      locally-validated Palliative care Outcome Scale- that links a limited pool of existing&#xD;
      Tanzanian palliative care specialists with patients, lay/family caregivers, and local health&#xD;
      workers.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that a mobile device-based symptom assessment, control and&#xD;
      communication application (m-Palliative Care Link (mPCL) will extend access to palliative&#xD;
      care specialists (hereafter named specialists), resulting in: a) symptom control information&#xD;
      exchange between specialists, patients, and local health workers and b) reduced symptom&#xD;
      burden in late-stage cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This hypothesis will be tested by accomplishing the following specific aims in the two-year&#xD;
      study period:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. In partnership with local palliative care specialists, to design and create a secure&#xD;
      mobile communication application (m-Palliative Care Link; mPCL) for facilitating remote&#xD;
      assessment of and communication about patient symptom control needs among specialists,&#xD;
      patients/caregivers, and local health workers (all of whom are referred to here as user&#xD;
      groups). mPCL will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Regularly deliver the APCA POS (hereafter POS) to the cancer patient/caregiver via&#xD;
           mobile device; allow them to complete the outcome scale on this device; and return&#xD;
           responses to the specialist and local health worker for access via a secure website.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Enable specialist POS review/action in partnership with the local health worker.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Allow the specialist to communicate with the patient/caregiver and local health worker&#xD;
           regarding further symptom assessment and control based on existing standards and the&#xD;
           patient's desires and needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Enable the specialist to generate/update patient records for ongoing review.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Record and track symptom control as a trajectory throughout the patient's illness via&#xD;
           collection, storage, and analysis of POS responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. To usability test an mPCL prototype through a combination of hands-on&#xD;
      observation/feedback and survey-based assessment of ease of use and suggestions for change&#xD;
      among 5-7 participants from each user group. Usability test data will be used to improve mPCL&#xD;
      design for subsequent field test (see Aim 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3. To field test and validate usability of mPCL among 45 late-stage cancer patients.&#xD;
      Late-stage cancer patients, who are eligible for the study, will be enrolled/consented,&#xD;
      trained on mPCL use, and provided with an mPCL-equipped mobile device prior to discharge from&#xD;
      ORCI. An mPCL record and discharge care plan will be generated by the specialist on his/her&#xD;
      personal computer and communicated with the patient's local health worker for review and&#xD;
      ongoing remote care communication and coordination. Field tests will continue for 4 months or&#xD;
      until patient death. Through a combination of surveys and interviews of user groups,&#xD;
      investigators will: determine the feasibility, acceptability, barriers, and facilitators of&#xD;
      mPCL for communication and action regarding symptom assessment, information exchange, and&#xD;
      symptom control; further optimize mPCL for ongoing study; determine the projected per patient&#xD;
      cost of mPCL implementation; and gather rich data on the symptom control needs of Tanzanian&#xD;
      cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4. To collect preliminary data comparing field test symptom outcomes with 45 usual care&#xD;
      patients (ORCI palliative care clinic patients). Patients will be identified, enrolled and&#xD;
      consented during their scheduled outpatient clinic visit. POS responses will be collected at&#xD;
      the time of each clinic visit for up to 4 months. Through examination/between-group&#xD;
      comparisons (mPCL intervention versus usual care) of symptom-based outcomes and medication&#xD;
      type, dose and duration, investigators will collect preliminary data on mPCL impact that is&#xD;
      critical to design of a future large-scale, randomized mPCL outcomes study.&#xD;
