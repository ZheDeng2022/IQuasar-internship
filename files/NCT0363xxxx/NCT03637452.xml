    <textblock>
      The overall aim of the current research is to understand purchasing and product choice&#xD;
      behaviors of tobacco/nicotine users if banning the sale of fully nicotinized cigarettes were&#xD;
      to go into effect. A sample of up to 30 current cigarette users (n=15) and dual e-cigarette&#xD;
      and combustible cigarette users (n=15) who are willing to try an alternative&#xD;
      nicotine-delivery device will be recruited. They will complete the screening visit, visit 1&#xD;
      and 2 preceded by 12 hours of nicotine/tobacco abstinent.&#xD;

      Participants will be provided information about the study and will provide initial consent&#xD;
      for screening via an online screener. Written consent will be completed in person when&#xD;
      participants are present to the laboratory. Eligible participants will include anyone over&#xD;
      the age of 18 years and those who exclusively use combustible cigarettes or those who dual&#xD;
      use e-cigarettes and combustible cigarettes. For the exclusive cigarette group, we will allow&#xD;
      some e-cigarette experimentation. Participants will complete three in-lab study visits (1&#xD;
      screener visit and 2 study visits) separated by a standard minimum 48-hour washout period.&#xD;
      They will be offered an Uber or other rideshare service as transportation to each study&#xD;
      visit, however, they will not be required to use the service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete an in-person screening visit in which they will be rescreened&#xD;
      according to the eligibility criteria. Their exhaled carbon monoxide (eCO) will be checked&#xD;
      prior to their visits as well as breath alcohol and urine pregnancy (for females) test will&#xD;
      be conducted. Participant will also complete baseline assessment measures and Balloon Analog&#xD;
      Risk Task (BART)- computerized task measuring impulsivity. At visit 2, participants will&#xD;
      complete a standard 10 puff bout with the three e-cigarette devices and their usual brand&#xD;
      cigarette. During visit 3, participants will complete three concurrent choice tasks in a&#xD;
      counter-balanced fashion.&#xD;

Serum nicotine will be measured throughout each standardized puffing bout. Greater levels of serum nicotine will be indicative of greater nicotine delivery.</description>

      During their PK (Pharmacokinetics) visits, Blood will be collected during specific time&#xD;
      points and plasma will be extracted from the blood. Plasma will be used to analyze the levels&#xD;
      of nicotine in it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine will be collected from female participants in order to confirm their pregnancy status.&#xD;
      Saliva will be collected during their screening visit to analyze for cotinine levels in order&#xD;

        A sample of up to 30 current cigarette smokers and dual e-cigarette and cigarette users who&#xD;
        are willing to use/try an alternative nicotine-delivery device will be recruited via&#xD;
        advertisements/ recruitment materials (e.g., craigslist, ads on OSU, OU, and UCO campuses,&#xD;
        OUHSC, email) and referrals. Participants will live in the Oklahoma City, OK metro area.&#xD;
        Participants will be provided information about the study and provide initial consent for&#xD;
