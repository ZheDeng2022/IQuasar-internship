  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is the study of the combination of PEGPH20 and Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) for&#xD;
      patients with previously treated Hyaluronan High (HA-high) metastatic pancreatic ductal&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma. This study is an interventional, unblinded, open label study. Approximately&#xD;
      35 subjects will be enrolled. The trial will require approximately a total of 18 months,&#xD;
      including 12 months for enrollment, with an additional 6 months for patient follow-up, data&#xD;
      collection and study closure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will participate in the trial from the time the subject signs the Informed&#xD;
      Consent Form (ICF) through the final contact. After a screening phase of up to 21 days,&#xD;
      eligible subjects will receive PEGPH20 beginning with Cycle 1 Day 1, on Days 1, 8 15 of every&#xD;
      3 week-cycles and pembrolizumab beginning on Cycle 1 Day 1 (2-4 hrs after PEGPH20), every&#xD;
      3-week-cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment with PEGPH20 and pembrolizumab will continue until progressive disease (PD),&#xD;
      unacceptable adverse events (AEs), intercurrent illness that prevents further administration&#xD;
      of treatment, investigator's decision to withdraw the subject, subject withdraws consent,&#xD;
      pregnancy of the subject, noncompliance with trial treatment or procedure requirements,&#xD;
      subject receives 35 treatments (approximately 24 months) of pembrolizumab, or administrative&#xD;
      reasons requiring cessation of treatment. Subjects who discontinue for reasons other than PD&#xD;
      will have post-treatment follow-up for disease status until PD, initiating a non-study cancer&#xD;
      treatment, withdrawing consent, or becoming lost to follow-up. All subjects will be followed&#xD;
      by telephone for overall survival (OS) until death, withdrawal of consent, or the end of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the end of treatment, each subject will be followed for 30 days for AE monitoring.&#xD;
      Serious adverse events (SAE) and events of clinical interest (ECI) will be collected for 90&#xD;
      days after the end of treatment or for 30 days after the end of treatment if the subject&#xD;
      initiates new anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Combination strategies geared towards blocking the PD1/PD-L1 inhibitory pathway, such as with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab, concurrent with stroma depletion (PEGPH20) may induce synergistic anti-cancer&#xD;
      activity and immune responses in pancreatic cancer. Effective harnessing of the immune system&#xD;
      and rational combinations with stroma-targeting biological agents (PEGPH20) is a novel field&#xD;
      that needs to be explored in pancreatic cancer. This phase II trial will determine the&#xD;
      efficacy of pembrolizumab plus PEGPH20 in metastatic pancreatic cancer patients who have&#xD;
      HA-high tumor expression. Stroma and immune-related biomarkers will be tested prospectively&#xD;
      in blood and tumor biopsies at baseline, after 6 weeks of therapy, and at time of cancer&#xD;
      progression. A phase I study with pembrolizumab and PEGPH20 is ongoing in lung and gastric&#xD;
      cancer patients (NCT02563548), and demonstrated safety and tolerability of this combination&#xD;
      at the doses administered in this study (Halozyme data).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunotherapies have the potential to induce durable therapeutic responses although this&#xD;
      typically occurs in a small fraction of patients. Biomarker-guided patient selection can, in&#xD;
      principle, identify those patients most likely to benefit. The investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      stroma remodeling with PEGPH20 will potentiate effector CD8 T cell lymphocyte infiltration&#xD;
      and sensitize pancreatic cancer to immune therapy, and that immunologic, and/or genomic&#xD;
      biomarkers will identify patient subsets most likely to benefit. As examples, MSI-high status&#xD;
      and high tumor mutational burden (hypermutation) have been linked to sensitivity to immune&#xD;
      checkpoint inhibitors (Le et al. 2015, Le et al. 2016).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assays may include but are not limited to: Immunohistochemical analysis, profiling of the&#xD;
      immune transcriptome, circulating cytokine analyses, flow cytometric analyses of peripheral&#xD;
      and intratumoral immune response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open label non-randomized Phase II trial for patients with previously treated&#xD;
      metastatic ductal pancreatic adenocarcinoma with HA-high expression, to assess the&#xD;
      progression-free survival rate (PFS) of patients treated with this combination therapy.&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints will assess safety and tolerability, overall response rate (ORR), disease&#xD;
      control rate (DCR= CR+PR+SD), duration of response and stable disease (DOR), and overall&#xD;
      survival (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be an estimated 35 patients enrolled into the study, using 5 centers in the U.S.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall response rates as well as individual categories of response (CR, PR, SD, and PD) will&#xD;
      be determined using RECIST 1.1. Time-to-event endpoints, including PFS and OS will be&#xD;
      assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Toxicity (adverse events) will be recorded using the&#xD;
      NCI CTCAE, version 5.0 (published Nov 2017, Appendix B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will start treatment with PEGPH20 3 microgram/kg IV weekly x 3, and&#xD;
      pembrolizumab 200 mg IV every 3 weeks, in 3-week cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients may remain on treatment with PEGPH20 in combination with pembrolizumab as long as&#xD;
      they are receiving clinical benefit, until disease progression per RECIST 1.1 criteria, or&#xD;
      until untolerable toxicity develops, whichever comes first. If no disease progression,&#xD;
      patients will be allowed to remain on study treatment for up to 24 months. If no disease&#xD;
      progression, but with unacceptable toxicity from PEGPH20, patients will be allowed to&#xD;
      continue on pembrolizumab alone for up to 24 months if deemed appropriate by the&#xD;
      investigator. If pembrolizumab needs to be discontinued for toxicity, patients may continue&#xD;
      treatment with PEGPH20 alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The estimated duration for accrual is anticipated to be 12 months. Patients will be followed&#xD;
      up for a minimum of 6 months. The overall study duration is estimated at approximately 18&#xD;
      months.&#xD;

             contraception for the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Male subjects of childbearing potential must agree to use an adequate method of&#xD;
             contraception starting with the first dose of study therapy through 120 days after the&#xD;
             last dose of study therapy.&#xD;

&#xD;
         24. Has known active Hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g., HCV RNA&#xD;
             [qualitative] is detected).&#xD;
&#xD;
         25. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy. Note:&#xD;
             Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and&#xD;
