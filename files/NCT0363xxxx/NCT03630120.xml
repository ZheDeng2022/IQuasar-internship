  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants will have been diagnosed with advanced progressive thyroid cancer and are about&#xD;
      to start treatment with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of tyrosine kinase&#xD;
      inhibitor therapy (Lenvatinib or Sorafenib for differentiated thyroid cancer [which includes&#xD;
      papillary thyroid cancer, follicular thyroid cancer, and poorly differentiated thyroid&#xD;
      cancer]; and Cabozantinib or Vandetanib for medullary thyroid cancer) through adaptive&#xD;
      (intermittent) versus conventional (continuous) regimen.&#xD;

      Population: Patients with advanced progressive 131I-refractory DTC or MTC will be enrolled to&#xD;
      this study. Forty-five patients responding to TKI therapy (defined as 50% drop in tumor&#xD;
      marker level within the first two months of treatment) will be randomized to receive TKI&#xD;
      therapy either through adaptive (intermittent) or conventional (continuous) regimen.&#xD;

    <description>The response rate will be estimated using binomial theory with Wilson's method for the 95% confidence interval. Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum longest diameter (LD). Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for partial response nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 48 months</time_frame>
    <description>The median progression-free survival rates will be estimated from the Kaplan-Meier curve with the 95% confidence interval obtained from Greenwood's formula. Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions.</description>

Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum longest diameter (LD). Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for partial response nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started.</description>

          <description>The response rate will be estimated using binomial theory with Wilson's method for the 95% confidence interval. Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum longest diameter (LD). Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for partial response nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started.</description>
