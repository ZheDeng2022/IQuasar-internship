      Full Title: A phase II, randomized, open-label, double-blind, two-center study to evaluate&#xD;
      the tolerability, safety and dose-finding of oil cannabis preparation for pain in Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Short title: Cannabis oil for pain in Parkinson's disease Sample Size: N = 15 Study&#xD;
      Population: Patients with Parkinson's disease and pain, without cognitive impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration: July 2018 - July 2019&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Agent/ Intervention: Cannabis oil: mixed oil cannabis preparation consisting of 3&#xD;
      different formulations of ∆-9THC and cannabidiol - 18:0; 10:10; and 1:20 respectively.&#xD;
      Cannabis oil will be administered orally once per day, as required for pain; or taken 4h&#xD;
      before bedtime, if no pain.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE Pain is a common symptom in PD and is reported in up to 50 % of&#xD;
      patients. Pain in PD has been classified as musculoskeletal, dystonic (particularly in&#xD;
      OFF-periods), radicular and central pain, and is frequently associated with muscle rigidity,&#xD;
      postural abnormalities and bradykinesia. Often, the presence of pain in PD is associated with&#xD;
      the daily fluctuations in the motor symptoms of PD. In addition, some patients experience&#xD;
      'off-dystonia' which affects the toes and feet, with painful cramps and posturing. The&#xD;
      treatment of pain in PD patients with such fluctuating symptoms involves optimizing the dose&#xD;
      of levodopa or other dopaminergic drugs to treat the OFF periods. Frequently, the pain does&#xD;
      not resolve on altering the PD medication and remains difficult to treat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cannabis Sativa (marijuana) and its major psychoactive constituent, delta-9-&#xD;
      tetrahydrocannabinol(Δ9THC) have been used for centuries to treat pain. The mechanism of&#xD;
      action is likely mediated via cannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2) in basal ganglia and spinal&#xD;
      circuits. Because of these potential therapeutic properties, several synthetic and naturally&#xD;
      occurring cannabinoid preparations have been manufactured. Cannabinoids have been&#xD;
      demonstrated to alleviate allodynia or hyperalgesia in animal models of pain; the effect on&#xD;
      pain modulation may be secondary to CB1 receptors in the amygdala, thalamus, spinal cord and&#xD;
      dorsal root ganglion. Several recent clinical studies have demonstrated the potential&#xD;
      efficacy of synthetic and naturally occurring cannabinoids in pain. Synthetic cannabinoids&#xD;
      such as nabilone and nabiximols are now licensed as add-on therapy in multiple sclerosis and&#xD;
      advanced cancer for relief of pain. A Canadian systematic review of randomized clinical&#xD;
      trials of cannabinoids (cannabis, nabilone, dronabinol and nabiximols) for the treatment of&#xD;
      chronic non-cancer pain (neuropathic pain, mixed chronic pain, rheumatoid arthritis,&#xD;
      fibromyalgia) concluded that cannabinoids are modestly effective. Other cannabinoids found in&#xD;
      cannabis sativa include cannabidiol (CBD). CBD potentially lacks a psychoactive effect, and&#xD;
      appears to act via non-CB receptor-mediated actions including ion channels and enzymes.&#xD;
      Pre-clinical studies suggest anti-inflammatory, analgesic, anti-nausea, anti-emetic,&#xD;
      anti-psychotic, anti-ischemic, anxiolytic, and anti-epileptiform actions. Thus, the advantage&#xD;
      of CBD in PD is a potentially lesser risk of cognitive dysfunction and psychosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there is an oil preparation (CanniMed® Oil) in Canada, with the advantage of ease&#xD;
      of administration. CanniMed® Oil is a mixed oil preparation that contains both Δ9THC and CBD,&#xD;
      of varying proportions of Δ9THC (more psychoactive component) and CBD (18:0; 10:10; 1:20&#xD;
      respectively). Investigators of this study have experience in conducting trials using&#xD;
      synthetic cannabinoids in movement disorders, including PD. Investigators have demonstrated&#xD;
      tolerability, but limited efficacy, of short-term administration of clinically available oral&#xD;
      tablet cannabinoids in idiopathic dystonia. More specifically in PD, investigators have&#xD;
      assessed nabilone for the treatment of levodopa-induced dyskinesia with documented efficacy.&#xD;
      Of interest to the current proposal, in this study, investigators also found an improvement&#xD;
      in painful OFF-period limb dystonia in 2 out of 7 subjects. It is unknown if this effect is a&#xD;
      specific analgesic effect or related with an anti-dystonia effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY HYPOTHESIS Despite the major advances in understanding the pathophysiology of the&#xD;
      endocannabinoid system, there are many unknowns in the use of cannabinoids for medical&#xD;
      purposes. To date, clinical studies with cannabinoids in PD have been inconclusive and the&#xD;
      use of cannabinoids remains controversial due to a lack of well-powered confirmatory clinical&#xD;
      studies and obvious safety concerns. However, the known efficacy of cannabinoids in reducing&#xD;
      pain suggests that PD-related pain may also be a reasonable target for cannabinoids. Combined&#xD;
      with the potential rationale for reducing dystonia, we hypothesize that cannabinoids could&#xD;
      reduce pain in PD, regardless of the PD-specific pain cause.&#xD;
&#xD;

    <measure>Changes in the Clinical global Impression of pain severity and improvement</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline (Visit 1) to end of study (Visit 5); total 35 days.</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinical Global Impression - Severity scale (CGI-S) is a 7-point scale that requires the clinician to rate the severity of the patient's illness at the time of assessment, relative to the clinician's past experience with patients who have the same diagnosis. The Clinical Global Impression - Improvement scale (CGI-I) is a 7 point scale that requires the clinician to assess how much the patient's illness has improved or worsened relative to a baseline state at the beginning of the intervention.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) (adjusted for baseline)</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline (Visit 1) to end of study (Visit 5); total 35 days.</time_frame>
    <description>The ESS is a self-administered questionnaire with 8 questions. Respondents are asked to rate, on a 4-point scale (0-3), their usual chances of dozing off or falling asleep while engaged in eight different activities. The ESS score (the sum of 8 item scores, 0-3) can range from 0 to 24.</description>
