      The main aim of this research is to examine the potential of 5HT7 antagonists for the&#xD;
      treatment of cognitive impairment in bipolar disorder by determining the effect of the 5HT7&#xD;
      antagonist JNJ-18038683 on cognitive and emotional processing related brain activity in&#xD;
      cognitively impaired people with bipolar disorder and healthy participants using functional&#xD;
      MRI (fMRI). This study is designed to contribute to the rational validation of 5HT7&#xD;
      antagonists as a treatment for cognitive impairment in bipolar disorder and to support the&#xD;
      development of clinical trials and further drug development in this area. The study will also&#xD;
      examine the effect of 5HT7 antagonism on brain function in healthy participants as this has&#xD;
      never been investigated before, and to use as a comparator to determine whether 5HT7&#xD;
      antagonism effects disease specific impairments in task related brain activity and cerebral&#xD;
      blood flow.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the effect of 5HT7 antagonism on cognition related brain activations and&#xD;
      cognitive performance in people with bipolar disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To examine the effect of 5HT7 antagonism on emotional processing related brain activations in&#xD;
      people with bipolar disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To examine the effect of 5HT7 antagonism on behavioral measures of mood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine whether early behavioural 5HT7 antagonist drug effects can be detected which may&#xD;
      be linked to altered brain activations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To explore whether factors, such as baseline measures of cognitive impairment and polygenic&#xD;
      risk score, predict the extent of JNJ-18038683 related treatment effects on brain activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN The study will use a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, cross-over,&#xD;
      pharmacological functional MRI (fMRI) design to examine the neural and behavioural effects of&#xD;
      one week's treatment with the 5HT7 antagonist, JNJ-18038683, and placebo. Participants will&#xD;
      attend four study visits: a screening visit, a baseline visit and two neuroimaging visits.&#xD;
      Each neuroimaging visit will be identical and comprise structural imaging, perfusion imaging&#xD;
      with arterial spin labelling, resting state and task-based functional MRI. FMRI tasks will be&#xD;
      working memory (N-back), emotional processing (faces), and paired associate visuospatial&#xD;
      learning (PAL). On the neuroimaging visits, a neuropsychological battery will also be&#xD;
      performed, subjective and behavioural effects will be assessed with standard questionnaires&#xD;
      and adverse events will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NUMBER OF SUBJECTS 34 cognitively impaired participants with bipolar disorder and 34 healthy&#xD;
      participants will complete the study. Replacements are allowed in case of drop-out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TARGET POPULATION Male and female patients with a current diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder and&#xD;
      healthy volunteers. All participants will be right-handed. Patients will be primarily&#xD;
      recruited through South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust clinical services, with&#xD;
      other trusts potentially contributing to recruitment. Participants will also be recruited by&#xD;
      public advertising, online and social media and through NIHR Mental Health CRN. Healthy&#xD;
      volunteers will be recruited through advertisement within King's College London, in the local&#xD;
      press, online and through contacting participants from previous studies who have expressed an&#xD;
      interest in further research participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DRUG (DOSE/ROUTE/REGIMEN) Name of product: JNJ-18038683, an investigational drug, a&#xD;
      5HT7 antagonist Dose: 20mg once daily Administration: Oral Duration of dosing: One week&#xD;
&#xD;
      JNJ-18038683 and matching placebos will be provided by Janssen Research and Development, LLC,&#xD;
      the manufacturer of JNJ-18038683.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ASSESSMENTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening visit (Visit 1):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant's cognitive; mood and physical health suitability will be assessed during this&#xD;
      visit. Participants will complete the RAVLT to screen for cognitive impairment. Bipolar&#xD;
      disorder DSM-5 diagnosis will be confirmed using the M.I.N.I. 6.0. Mood and anxiety symptoms&#xD;
      will be assessed using the HAM-D, YMRS, QIDS-CR, C-SSRS, Altman Self-Rating Mania scale and&#xD;
      HAM-A mood rating scales. Substance use will be assessed using the cannabis experiences,&#xD;
      Fagerstrom smoking and AUDIT alcohol questionnaires. All participants will undergo a physical&#xD;
      examination, ECG, urine drug screen, breath alcohol test, pregnancy test for females,&#xD;
      urinalysis and blood will be taken to assess hepatic, renal and haematological function and&#xD;
      to determine bipolar disorder polygenic risk scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline visit (Visit 2) If the screening assessments indicate suitability, participants will&#xD;
      then attend a baseline visit. They will complete a brief physical health examination&#xD;
      including recording vital signs, ECG, urine drug screen, breath alcohol test and a pregnancy&#xD;
      test for females. Mood and anxiety symptoms will be assessed using the HAM-D, YMRS, QIDS-CR,&#xD;
      C-SSRS, Altman Self-Rating Mania scale and HAM-A mood rating scales. Sleep will be assessed&#xD;
      using the PSQI. Cognition will be assessed using the ISBD-BANC cognitive battery and&#xD;
      subjective cognitive impairment will be assessed using the PDQ and FAST questionnaires.&#xD;
      Participants will be provided with the week 1 study medication pack, determined by&#xD;
      randomization code, and a study diary to record taking each day's medication and any adverse&#xD;
      events experienced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging visits (Visit's 3 and 4):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo a brief medical examination, ECG and urine drug screen. Cognition,&#xD;
      mood, psychosocial functioning and sleep will be assessed at each neuroimaging visit using&#xD;
      the ISBD-BANC, PDQ, QIDS-CR, C-SSRS, YMRS, FAST and PSQI. A blood sample will be taken at&#xD;
      each visit to monitor hepatic, renal and haematological functions and so that plasma can be&#xD;
      stored to potentially measure JNJ-18038683 levels. During each imaging session, participants&#xD;
      will complete the n-back working memory, paired associate visuospatial learning (PAL), and&#xD;
      emotional faces recognition fMRI tasks, an arterial spin labelling (ASL) scan to assess&#xD;
      cerebral blood flow, a resting state scan, and a T1 and T2 structural scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROCEDURES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized into the study provided they have satisfied all selection&#xD;
      criteria. Each participant will be assigned to a sequence of treatment administrations by&#xD;
      means of a computer-generated, pseudo random code based on stacks of William's Squares, to&#xD;
      ensure each treatment is equally distributed across each study period. A blinded&#xD;
      randomization list will be provided by the pharmacist or delegate to the investigator and, in&#xD;
      accordance with the randomization list, if a participant is withdrawn from the study, the&#xD;
      replacement participant will be allocated to the same treatment sequence as the subject they&#xD;
      are replacing. Replacement numbers will be discussed and agreed between the investigator and&#xD;
      the pharmacist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analytical Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A brief plan for data analysis is provided in the main body of the protocol. A detailed&#xD;
      Statistical Analytical Plan will be produced before the end of the data collection phase of&#xD;
      the study. A brief description of the main endpoints is provided here:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Change in cognitive task related right superior frontal gyrus and dorsolateral&#xD;
           prefrontal cortex brain activations associated with JNJ-18038683 treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Change in cognitive performance, as measured by change in International Society for&#xD;
           Bipolar Disorders Battery for the Assessment of Cognition (ISBD-BANC) test battery&#xD;

&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Change in emotional processing related amygdala brain activations associated with&#xD;
