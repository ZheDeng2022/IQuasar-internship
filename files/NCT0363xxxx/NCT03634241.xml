    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well pembrolizumab works in preventing lung cancer patients&#xD;
      with stage I-II non-small cell lung cancer or high-risk pulmonary nodules. Immunotherapy with&#xD;
      monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the&#xD;
      cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine whether immune checkpoint blockade using pembrolizumab eliminates persistent&#xD;
      (on two computed tomography [CT] scans at least 3 months apart with no evidence of shrinkage&#xD;
      or regression) high-risk indeterminate pulmonary nodules (IPNs) (estimated risk of being&#xD;
      diagnosed with lung cancer within 2-4 years &gt;= 15% for patients with no history of lung&#xD;
      cancer or &gt; 10% for patients with history of stage I-II non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)&#xD;
      who complete surgery and standard adjuvant chemotherapy if indicated) at 6 months after&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine whether immune checkpoint blockade using pembrolizumab decreases the&#xD;
      incidence of lung cancers confirmed by histology (biopsy or resection).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine whether immune checkpoint blockade using pembrolizumab prolongs cancer free&#xD;
      survival (disease free survival [DFS]) compared with observation in patients with high-risk&#xD;
      IPNs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine whether immune checkpoint blockade using pembrolizumab prolongs lung&#xD;
      cancer-specific survival compared with observation in patients with high-risk IPNs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine whether immune checkpoint blockade using pembrolizumab prolongs overall&#xD;
      survival (OS) compared with observation in patients with high-risk IPNs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To assess the safety and tolerability of pembrolizumab in patients with high-risk IPNs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To assess quality of life patient reported outcomes in patients treated with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab compared with patients under observation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To determine whether immune checkpoint blockade using pembrolizumab decreases the solid&#xD;
      component of high-risk IPNs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. To assess the health-related quality of life (QoL) on subjects enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To explore the radiographic (including radiomic features) evolution of high-risk IPNs with&#xD;
      and without treatment of pembrolizumab and to assess their association with risks of risk of&#xD;
      lung cancer as well as their association with clinical benefit/toxicities in patients treated&#xD;
      with pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To explore the germline deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) profile and genomic evolution of&#xD;
      circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) of patients with high-risk IPNs and assess their association&#xD;
      with risks of risk of lung cancer as well as their association with clinical&#xD;
      benefit/toxicities in patients treated with pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To explore the T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire evolution of patients with high-risk&#xD;
      IPNs and assess their association with risks of risks of lung cancer as well as their&#xD;
      association with clinical benefit/toxicities in patients treated with pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To explore the evolution of serum soluble factors, such as IFN-gamma and interferon&#xD;
      inducible factors (such as CXCL9 and CXCL10), IL-12, TNFalpha, IL-10, TGF-beta, VEGF, IL-6,&#xD;
      IL-8, IL-17, IL-18, C-reactive protein etc. and assess their association with risks of risks&#xD;
      of lung cancer as well as their association with clinical benefit/toxicities in patients&#xD;
      treated with pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To explore the evolution of immunophenotyping or characterization of the immune cell&#xD;
      subsets in the periphery, including, but not limited to, T cells, B cells, natural killer&#xD;
      [NK] cells, or subpopulations of the aforementioned immune cell types and assess their&#xD;
      association with risks of risks of lung cancer as well as their association with clinical&#xD;
      benefit/toxicities in patients treated with pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To explore the evolution of microbiome and assess their association with risks of lung&#xD;
      cancer as well as their association with clinical benefit/toxicities in patients treated with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A: Patients receive standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B: Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Cycles&#xD;
      repeat every 3 weeks for up to 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After conclusion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, at 1.5, 3, and 6&#xD;
      months, and then every 12 weeks thereafter.&#xD;

All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level. Thus a high score for a functional scale represents a high / healthy level of functioning, a high score for the global health status / QoL represents a high QoL, but a high score for a symptom scale / item represents a high level of symptomatology / problems.</description>
