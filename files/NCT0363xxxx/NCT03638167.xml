  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 study of central nervous system (CNS) locoregional adoptive therapy with&#xD;
      autologous CD4+ and CD8+ T cells that are lentivirally transduced to express an EGFR806&#xD;
      specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) and EGFRt. CAR T cells are delivered via an&#xD;
      indwelling catheter into the tumor cavity or the ventricular system in children and young&#xD;
      adults with recurrent or refractory EGFR-positive CNS tumors. The primary objectives of this&#xD;
      protocol are to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and tolerability of CNS-delivered&#xD;
      fractionated CAR T cell infusions employing intra-patient dose escalation. Subjects with&#xD;
      supratentorial tumors will receive sequential EGFR806-specific CAR T cells delivered into the&#xD;
      tumor resection cavity, subjects with infratentorial tumors will receive sequential CAR T&#xD;
      cells delivered into the fourth ventricle, and subjects with leptomeningeal disease will&#xD;
      receive sequential CAR T cells delivered into the lateral ventricle. The secondary objectives&#xD;
      are to assess CAR T cell distribution within the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the extent to&#xD;
      which CAR T cells egress into the peripheral circulation, and EGFR expression at recurrence&#xD;
      of initially EGFR-positive tumors. Additionally, tumor response will be evaluated by magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI) and CSF cytology. The exploratory objectives are to analyze CSF&#xD;
      specimens for biomarkers of anti-tumor CAR T cell presence and functional activity.&#xD;
