  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the largest concerns for patients with Chronic kidney disease&#xD;
      (CKD). At present time the investigators do not have proven effective strategies to reduce&#xD;
      high CVD related deaths in CKD. This study assesses a novel therapy (hydroxychloroquine, HCQ)&#xD;
      for the treatment of CVD in patients with CKD. This is the first human proof-of-concept study&#xD;
      and is planned to be conducted among US Veterans, who suffer from both CKD and CVD at a&#xD;
      disproportionately greater rates. The outcome of this study has the potential to provide an&#xD;
      entirely new line of therapy for the treatment of CVD in CKD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the most prominent cause of morbidity and mortality among&#xD;
      patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), and end stage kidney disease (ESKD).&#xD;
      Unfortunately at the present time, the investigators do not have an effective treatment to&#xD;
      reduce the high CVD mortality in these populations. Accelerated atherosclerosis,&#xD;
      inflammation, and vascular stiffness are prominent factors contributing to CVD in CKD.&#xD;
      Interventions that can effectively counter these factors may provide significant benefits for&#xD;
      the management of CVD in CKD. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is an inexpensive and safe&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drug that has been in clinical use for over 4 decades even in patients with&#xD;
      CKD and ESKD. In recent times, multiple in vitro, in vivo, and human cohort based data have&#xD;
      shown that HCQ benefits multiple parameters of CVD, including inflammation, endothelial&#xD;
      function, metabolic syndrome, insulin sensitivity and atherosclerosis. Recently the&#xD;
      investigators through the animal studies validated that HCQ indeed has significant&#xD;
      anti-atherosclerosis and vasculoprotective effects in CKD milieu. The investigators further&#xD;
      conducted a small, human, feasibility study that shows a potential for HCQ on parameters&#xD;
      relevant to CVD in CKD. As the next step, the investigators propose to conduct a&#xD;
      proof-of-concept, randomized controlled trial (RCT) to ascertain the effects of HCQ on the&#xD;
      structural, functional, and biochemical measures of atherosclerosis and CVD. The&#xD;
      investigators will enroll 100 albuminuric, stage 3b CKD subjects in a with 1:1 allocation&#xD;
      (HCQ : placebo) and treat for a duration of 18 months. The investigators' three specific aims&#xD;
      are as follows: Specific Aim (SA) 1 will evaluate the ability of HCQ, compared to placebo, to&#xD;
      slow the progression, or reverse atherosclerosis through serial examination of carotid&#xD;
      atherosclerosis through non-contrast MRI performed at baseline and after 9 and 18 months of&#xD;
      treatment with HCQ or placebo. The investigators will measure the change in total carotid&#xD;
      plaque volume (TPV) as the primary outcome measure, and changes in total plaque surface area,&#xD;
      maximal stenosis, and the type (fibrous, stable, or unstable), and stability of plaques as&#xD;
      secondary outcome measures. SA2 will evaluate the impact of HCQ vs. placebo on inflammation&#xD;
      (SA2a), and vascular stiffness (SA2b) at baseline, and at 6, 9, 12, and 18 months as&#xD;
      secondary outcome measures. The investigators will quantify inflammation through&#xD;
      high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (SA2a) and vascular stiffness through measurements of&#xD;
      aortic pulse wave velocity (SA2b). Specific Aim 3 will examine the effect of HCQ and placebo&#xD;
      on the trends of hard cardiac and renal outcomes and drug safety. The results of this trial&#xD;
      will provide critical preliminary data to justify and plan a definitive, multicenter RCT to&#xD;
      examine the effects of HCQ on hard outcomes of CVD in CKD. Additionally, this study may&#xD;
      provide insights into the importance of select inflammatory and vascular factors in CVD with&#xD;
      wider future implications for those with CKD and perhaps the general population.&#xD;
