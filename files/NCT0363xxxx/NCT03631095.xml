      Metastatic vertebral disease is a major hazard for oncological patients because the&#xD;
      performance and life quality will substantially deteriorate if presence of neoplastic&#xD;
      compression. And the subsequent treatment and overall survival will be dismal. Restoration of&#xD;
      vertebral stability and prevention of neurological deterioration are treatment goal. Surgical&#xD;
      treatment is an important and effective method for metastatic spinal disease. For aggressive&#xD;
      surgical method, long-term control is better. However, massive bleeding is often encountered&#xD;
      in this surgery, and preoperative evaluation is very important for successful operation.&#xD;
      Imaging play major role in this tasks. MRI, angiography, and nuclear medicine studies are&#xD;
      common modalities, but take longer time and are often suboptimal. Dual-energy CT has the&#xD;
      ability to detect contrast medium enhancement in osseous structure. It therefore is a&#xD;
      potential optimal tool in the evaluate the metastatic spinal malignancy. It also own&#xD;
      advantage of rapid scanning, optimal resolution, and easy reformatting.In this study, we&#xD;
      intend to use this tool to establish the imaging biomarker for tumoural vascularity, to&#xD;
      compare its performance with other modalities, and to investigate its optimal imaging&#xD;
      condition, which will bring valuable information for treatment planning for aggressive spinal&#xD;
      surgery before metastatic disease.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Spinal metastasis is the leading course of vertebral malignancy. It cause neoplastic spinal&#xD;
      cord compression and neurological deficit. The treatment strategy depend on the pathological&#xD;
      type, performance status, and life expectancy.(1, 2) The goal of treatment is to avoid&#xD;
      neurological deterioration, to keep functional life, and to control bone pain. Because&#xD;
      disease cure is rarely the treatment goal in the circumstance of metastatic disease, the&#xD;
      treatment strategy involve multidisciplinary approaches. When evidence of neoplastic&#xD;
      compression, local oncological treatment is often needed to preserve neurological function&#xD;
      and to restore vertebral column stability. Radiation therapy can be applied for some&#xD;
      radiosensitive tumour, but surgery is often required to meet above goal. Simple decompression&#xD;
      and fixation is often applied, but the long-term control rate is suboptimal. Aggressive&#xD;
      spinal surgery has relative longstanding effect to maintain neurological and oncological&#xD;
      outcome in selective patients. (3)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aggressive spinal surgery, including extensive corpectomy, vertebrotrectomy, and even&#xD;
      spondylectomy, however, is a massive procedure and may result in large amount, sometime&#xD;
      life-threatening blood loss. To achieve better surgical outcome and decrease complication,&#xD;
      preoperative evaluation needs understanding the detailed skeleton and vascular anatomy. The&#xD;
      status of vertebral column stability, extent of tumour involvement, condition of neurological&#xD;
      tissue, and vascularity of the tumoural tissue, are all important in determination of the&#xD;
      surgical planning and outcome. In many circumstances, preoperative embolization is often&#xD;
      required to control blood loss as well.(4, 5) Imaging plays major role in the above&#xD;
      information related to the surgical decision and planning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current preoperative imaging evaluation include MRI, angiography, bone scan and PET. (6) The&#xD;
      MRI is paramount in the spinal imaging. It provides outstanding soft tissue differentiation,&#xD;
      which usually depicting the abnormal tumoural tissue clearly. Therefore, MRI stands central&#xD;
      role in the surgical evaluation. Nevertheless, in real world, many patients are frail to&#xD;
      tolerate lengthy MRI study period, and the MR imaging quality is often suboptimal. For&#xD;
      vascular survey, angiography is capable to demonstrate spinal artery and tumour vascularity.&#xD;
      Since its relative invasiveness, it is only reserved for patients when preoperative&#xD;
      embolization is required or detection of spinal artery is warranted. And because the&#xD;
      angiography study for tumour involves selective catheterization of separate segmental artery,&#xD;
      the global evaluation of tumoural tissue is not possible. As for nuclear medicine studies,&#xD;
      including bone scan and PET, they are highly sensitive and very convenient in detecting&#xD;
      multifocal disease. But they are relative non-specific for variable pathology and the spatial&#xD;
      resolution is not adequate for surgical evaluation. Therefore, they provide less information&#xD;
      when diagnosis has been established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CT is an important imaging tool for spinal disease. Because of its rapid acquisition,&#xD;
      adequate resolution, and easy reformatting, it is optimal for intolerable patients. (7)&#xD;
      Nevertheless, osseous structure is extremely radiopaque, evaluation of tumoural enhancement&#xD;
      in vertebrae is not easy. It is reserved in special condition, such as detection of vascular&#xD;
      structure for embolization and surgery. Recently commercialized dual-energy CT (DECT) can&#xD;
      meet the prior result of conventional CT with added value. (8) It uses different energy level&#xD;
      simultaneously to image the object. Therefore, optimal bony removal and contrast-noise-ratio&#xD;
      can be expected.(9, 10) In spinal disease, it has been used in the detection of marrow edema&#xD;
      and compression fracture. (9, 11) On the other hand, material-specific information can be&#xD;
      obtained, quantitative evaluation of tumoural enhancement by contrast medium is possible.&#xD;
      (12) Along with imaging post-processing technique, DECT can highlight the tumoural part in&#xD;
      the background of hyperdense bone. (13) DECT is a promising tool to study the vascularity of&#xD;
      the metastatic vertebral tumour. This information is valuable for the surgeon in the decision&#xD;
      making and planning for the operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We intend to use the dual energy CT in the preoperative evaluation of the vertebral&#xD;
      metastasis before aggressive surgery. The research potential and purposes are manifold.&#xD;
      First, we want to establish imaging biomarker for tumoural vascularity. Many different&#xD;
      enhancement parameters as potential candidate will be measured. Second, we intend to&#xD;
      establish one-stop imaging method; therefore, we will compare the diagnostic performance with&#xD;
      other imaging modalities. Third, the optimal imaging parameter in the evaluation of bony&#xD;
      lesion will be investigated, and many image technical condition will be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purposeï¼š&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To establish the quantitative imaging biomarker for vascularity in metastatic vertebral&#xD;
           tumour&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To obtain the optimal DECT scanning parameter and reformatting method in vertebral&#xD;
           osseous tumour&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To provide detailed anatomical information for embolization and surgery&#xD;
