    <textblock>
      This research study is studying several new investigational drug combinations as a possible&#xD;
      treatment for follicular lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drugs involved are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rituximab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Utomilumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Avelumab&#xD;

      This research study is a Phase 1 clinical trial. Phase 1 clinical trials test the safety of&#xD;
      an investigational intervention and also try to define the appropriate dose of the&#xD;
      investigational intervention to use for further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the&#xD;
      intervention is being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Utomilumab and avelumab are drugs which may stimulate the immune system against tumor cells.&#xD;
      Because they activate the immune system, they are sometimes called immunotherapy drugs. The&#xD;
      FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved utomilumab or avelumab for&#xD;
      treatment of this cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rituximab is approved by the FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) as a treatment&#xD;
      option for this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this research is to learn about the effects of combining the immunotherapy&#xD;
      drugs utomilumab and avelumab with rituximab in follicular lymphoma. The investigators hope&#xD;
      to learn how safe the combinations of treatments are for participants with follicular&#xD;
      lymphoma.&#xD;

    <description>Rituximab works by targeting the CD20 antigen on normal and malignant B-cells. Then the body's natural immune defenses are recruited to attack and kill the marked B-cells. Stem cells (young cells in the bone marrow that will develop into the various types of cells) do not have the CD20 antigen. This allows healthy B-cells to regenerate after treatmen</description>
