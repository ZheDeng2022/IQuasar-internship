  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Duchenne muscular dystrophy(DMD) is the most commonly inherited pediatric muscular disorder.&#xD;
      It is an X-linked genetic progressive and degenerative myopathy characterized by progressive&#xD;
      weakness, which can lead to loss of motor functions in puberty as well as cardiac,respiratory&#xD;
      involvement and premature death. The disease is one of a group of myopathies that differ&#xD;
      depending on the degree of severity and the affected muscle types. It occurs at a rate of&#xD;
      approximately 1:3500 male births and arises due to spontaneous mutations in the Dystrophin&#xD;
      gene (locus Xp21.2); 65% of causative mutations are intragenic deletions, 6-10% are&#xD;
      intragenic duplications and 30-35% are point mutations (along with other sequence&#xD;
      variations). The disease is caused by a deficiency of Dystrophin or the synthesis of&#xD;
      functionally impotent Dystrophin, a critical protein component of the Dystrophin glycoprotein&#xD;
      complex acting as a link between the cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix in skeletal&#xD;
      and cardiac muscles. A consequence of Dystrophin glycoprotein complex inefficiency is muscle&#xD;
      fragility, contraction-induced damage, necrosis and inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glucocorticoid can prolong ambulation by 2 to 3 years, reduce scoliosis, and temper pulmonary&#xD;
      and cardiac decline in the second decade of life. However, glucocorticoids causes well-known&#xD;
      side effects, which are intolerable in more than 25% of patients. Thus, a disease-specific&#xD;
      treatment is a major unmet need. Investigators have proposed various possibilities for the&#xD;
      beneficial effects of corticosteroid based mainly on observations in mouse models of muscular&#xD;
      dystrophy and on a limited number of studies in patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These possibilities include&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Reducing cytotoxic T lymphocytes&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Increasing Laminin expression and myogenic repair&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Retarding muscle apoptosis and cellular infiltration&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Enhancing Dystrophin expression&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Affecting neuromuscular transmission&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some patients with Duchenne Myopathy treated early with steroids appear to have an improved&#xD;
      long-term prognosis in muscle, myocardial outcome, and can help keep patients ambulatory for&#xD;
      more years than expected without treatment. One protocol gives prednisone (0.75 mg/kg/day)&#xD;
      for the 1st 10 days of each month to avoid chronic complications. Deflazacort, administered&#xD;
      as 0.9 mg/kg/day, may be more effective than prednisone. The American Academy of Neurology&#xD;
      and the Child Neurology Society recommend administering corticosteroids during the ambulatory&#xD;
      stage of the disease.Published recommendations suggest starting therapy between 2 and 5 years&#xD;
      of age in boys whose strength has plateaued or is declining, but earlier treatment may be&#xD;
      more beneficial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skeletal muscle has a great capacity to regenerate following muscle wasting caused by trauma&#xD;
      or disease.This regenerative potential is attributed primarily to skeletal-muscle resident&#xD;
      stem cells called satellite cells. In Duchenne Myopathy, satellite cells are exhausted&#xD;
      following many rounds of muscle degeneration and regeneration. Hence, satellite cells and&#xD;
      their progeny (myoblasts) have been considered as a promising candidate for cell replacement&#xD;
      therapy for DMD and other types of muscle disease. Small quantities of adult stem cells exist&#xD;
      in most tissues throughout the body where they remain quiescent for long periods of time&#xD;
      prior to being activated in response to disease or tissue injury. Adult stem cells can be&#xD;
      isolated from cells of the hematopoietic, neural, dermal, muscle and hepatic systems. Adult&#xD;
      stem cells give rise to cell types of the tissue from which they originated, but according to&#xD;
      scientific reports, they can differentiate into lineages other than their tissue of origin,&#xD;
      e.g. transplanted bone marrow or enriched hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) were reported to&#xD;
      give rise to cells of the mesoderm, endoderm and ectoderm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two main types of stem cells usually derived from adult bone marrow are HSCs and mesenchymal&#xD;
      stem cells (MSC). They can sometimes be obtained from fat, skin, periosteum, synovial&#xD;
      membrane and muscle as well. MSCs are multipotent and capable of differentiating into several&#xD;
      connective tissue types including osteocytes, chondrocytes, adipocytes, tenocytes and&#xD;
      myoblasts. They can also impose an additional anti-inflammatory and paracrine effect on&#xD;
      differentiation and tissue regeneration via cytokine pathways and have anti-apoptotic&#xD;
      features. These genetically determined pluripotent cells may be easily isolated from bone&#xD;
      marrow because they have membrane proteins (marker called cluster of differentiation (CD34 +)&#xD;
      and specific marker STRO-I). Compared with pluripotent embryonic stem cells or induced&#xD;
      pluripotent stem cells, mesenchymal stem cell have a greater biosafety profile and lower risk&#xD;
      of tumorigenicity, and perhaps that is why numerous -mesenchymal stem cell based therapies&#xD;
      have made it to the clinical trial stage. Stem cell based therapies for the treatment of&#xD;
      Duchenne Myopathy can proceed via two strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first is autologous stem cell transfer involving cells from a patient with Duchenne&#xD;
      Myopathy that are genetically altered in vitro to restore dystrophin expression and are&#xD;
      subsequently re-implanted. The second is allogenic stem cell transfer, containing cells from&#xD;
      an individual with functional dystrophin, which are transplanted into a dystrophic patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intramuscular route of administration can be considered most appropriate as muscular&#xD;
      dystrophy is primarily a muscle disease. The cells can be injected in several points in the&#xD;
      muscle alternatively they can be injected in the motor point of the muscle. A motor point is&#xD;
      the point at which the motor branch of the innervating nerve enters the muscle. It is the&#xD;
      point with the highest concentration of motor endplates and myoneural synapses. Due to high&#xD;
      numbers of neuromuscular junctions at this point, a muscle contraction can be easily elicited&#xD;
      using minimal electric stimulus. Motor points can therefore be identified as superficial&#xD;
      points directly over the points on the muscles with help of external electrical stimulation.&#xD;
      Limitation of this method is that only superficial muscles can be stimulated using this&#xD;
      method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an open study, Sharma and colleagues demonstrated the efficacy of autologous bone marrow&#xD;
      mononuclear transplantation by intramuscularly to patients with Duchenne Myopathy, Becker&#xD;
      muscular dystrophy and limb girdle muscular dystrophy. However, they did not provide the&#xD;
      molecular diagnosis of these dystrophies. No significant adverse events were noted. An&#xD;
      increase in trunk muscle strength was seen in 53% of the cases, 48% showed an increase in&#xD;
      upper limb strength, 59% showed an increase in lower limb strength and approximately 10%&#xD;
      showed improved gait. Eighty seven percent of 150 patients had functional improvement upon&#xD;
      physical examination and electromyogram studies after 12 month.&#xD;
