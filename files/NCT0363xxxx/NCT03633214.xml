  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of prostate cancer has been rising steadily both globally and in Malaysia.&#xD;
      Besides an ageing population, another reason cited to explain the increase, is the&#xD;
      corresponding increase in the prostate cancer screening rates, especially using non-invasive&#xD;
      tests like the prostate specific antigen (PSA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      General practitioners, being front liners in medicine, play an important role in helping men&#xD;
      make an informed decision on prostate cancer screening. In Malaysia, about 50% of GPs would&#xD;
      routinely screen asymptomatic men and 95% of them would use PSA as a screening tool. Despite&#xD;
      this, the evidence for screening is inconclusive, as evidenced from two major trials on&#xD;
      screening [The European Randomised Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) and&#xD;
      Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening trial (PLCO)]. Furthermore, clinical&#xD;
      practice guidelines globally provide conflicting recommendations on this subject, and none&#xD;
      has been published in Malaysia to date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, our study aims to determine the effectiveness of an online training module in&#xD;
      helping GPs' better understand the controversies surrounding prostate cancer screening, and&#xD;
      in so doing, improve their practice of screening. The investigators hypothesise that GPs who&#xD;
      are randomised to receive their online module will be less inclined to screen unnecessarily&#xD;
      for prostate cancer.&#xD;

      Study design: Randomised controlled trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting: This trial will involve GPs in the Klang Valley, encompassing the Petaling district&#xD;
      and Kuala Lumpur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The healthcare system in Malaysia is divided into public and private sectors. Patients pay a&#xD;
      standard minimal fee for public healthcare system whereas the private sector charges patients&#xD;
      based on the services provided. The study will be conducted in private GP clinics as PSA&#xD;
      testing is readily available compared to the public primary care setting. In public primary&#xD;
      care clinics, PSA screening is not offered as part of a routine screening programme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      With 80% power and 5% (two-sided) significance, with an estimated 40% reduction in PSA&#xD;
      screening from baseline in the intervention group and 10% in the control group, the number of&#xD;
      participants needed for each group is 38 (total 76). Therefore, a total of 96 GPs in the&#xD;
      Klang Valley will be recruited for this study, assuming a non-response rate of 20 GPs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention consists of two phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 The research team will develop 3 self-administered, online surveys, with the input of&#xD;
      family physicians and urologists. The surveys will capture basic demographic information&#xD;
      about the participating GPs (but not any identifiable information), and also their overall&#xD;
      knowledge and perception towards prostate cancer screening. In addition, all 3 surveys will&#xD;
      also contain 5 clinical vignettes that will relate to prostate cancer screening. After&#xD;
      reading the vignettes, the GPs will be asked whether or not they would recommend screening&#xD;
      for the particular patient in the given scenario; and should they choose to screen, which&#xD;
      screening method they would use (PSA, DRE, or both).&#xD;
&#xD;
      GPs will then be randomised to either receive an online training module (intervention) or&#xD;
      none (control).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon successful receipt of the GPs' response to the first survey, a second survey will be&#xD;
      sent to all the GPs via email. The participants will once again be invited to read and&#xD;
      respond to another set of vignettes of similar nature to those in phase 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GPs who have been randomised to the intervention arm will also receive a link in the second&#xD;
      email that will enable them to download an online training module. The participants will be&#xD;
      asked to view the training module prior to answering the second survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GPs in the control group will only receive the second survey and not the training module.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A third and final email will be sent to all the GPs who have successfully answered the second&#xD;
      survey, 3 months after the date of receipt of their second survey response. This final survey&#xD;
      will likewise, contain five clinical vignettes of similar nature to those of the two previous&#xD;
      surveys. The responses of GPs in the intervention group will then be compared before and&#xD;
      immediately after the online training video and also 3-months later; as well as to the&#xD;
      control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team will recruit the GPs from an existing GP database which has been created&#xD;
      from previous studies conducted in the Petaling District and Kuala Lumpur. A researcher and a&#xD;
      research assistant will be responsible for identifying and recruiting eligible participants.&#xD;
      An invitation letter, a study summary, a participant information sheet and consent form will&#xD;
      be sent via email to each GP. Consenting participants will be remunerated for their time and&#xD;
      effort spent in participating in the study. In the event response is poor, a research&#xD;
      assistant may need to arrange an appointment to visit the GPs at their clinics'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The McNemar test will be used to determine the phase differences in the proportion of GPs who&#xD;
      perform screening unnecessarily and the differences between the intervention and control&#xD;
      group. Chi square test will be used to compare the difference in proportions between the&#xD;
      intervention and control groups. GPs' characteristics associated with unnecessary screening&#xD;
      practice will be explored using logistic regression models using phase 1 data. Logistic&#xD;
      regression will be used for binary outcomes and the analyses will be adjusted for baseline&#xD;
      data. SPSS will be used to manage the data sets&#xD;
