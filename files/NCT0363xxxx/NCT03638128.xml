&#xD;
          -  Subject has provided informed consent/assent prior to initiation of any Study 20170534&#xD;
             specific activities/procedures. Subject's legally acceptable representative has&#xD;
             provided informed consent when the subject is legally too young to provide informed&#xD;
             consent and the subject has provided written assent based on local regulations and/or&#xD;
             guidelines prior to any study-specific activities/procedures being initiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is currently/was enrolled in Study 20130173 and completed the 20130173 End of&#xD;
             Study (EOS) visit (regardless of completing or ending investigational product early)&#xD;
             OR subjects who do not reconsent/rassent to transition to 3-Month Dosing Regimen on&#xD;
             Study 20130173 are also eligible for enrollment OR early terminated from Study&#xD;
             20130173 as a result of meeting BMD Z-score investigational product stopping criteria&#xD;
             and was required to early terminate from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with any prohibited proscribed medications while receiving denosumab.&#xD;
             Eligibility into study treatment with alternative osteoporosis medication/s of&#xD;
             investigator's choice, follow guidelines per the specific alternative osteoporosis&#xD;
             medication/s selected. For subjects off-treatment (observation only), no prohibited&#xD;
             medications apply.- Subjects currently receiving treatment in another investigational&#xD;
             device or drug study other than Study 20130173. Other investigational procedures while&#xD;
             participating in this study are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For subjects expected to receive investigational product (denosumab) at study day 1:&#xD;
             Female subject is pregnant or breastfeeding or planning to become pregnant or&#xD;
             breastfeed during treatment and for an additional 5 months after the last dose of&#xD;
             denosumab. Females of childbearing potential (Tanner Stage greater than or equal to 2)&#xD;
             should only be included in the study after a negative highly sensitive urine or serum&#xD;
             pregnancy test. For study treatment with alternative osteoporosis medication/s of&#xD;
             investigator's choice, follow guidelines per the specific alternative osteoporosis&#xD;
             medication/s selected. For Subjects off-treatment (observation only), no exclusion&#xD;
             applies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For subjects expected to receive investigational product (denosumab) at study day 1:&#xD;
             Female subjects of childbearing potential unwilling to practice true sexual abstinence&#xD;
             (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use 1 highly effective method of&#xD;
             contraception during treatment and for an additional 5 months after the last dose of&#xD;
             investigational product (denosumab). For study treatment with alternative osteoporosis&#xD;
             medication/s of investigator's choice, follow contraception guidelines per the&#xD;
             specific alternative osteoporosis medication/s selected. For subjects not receiving&#xD;
             any investigational product (observation only), no contraception required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History or evidence of any other clinically significant disorder, condition or disease&#xD;
             (with the exception of those outlined above) that, in the opinion of the investigator&#xD;
             or Amgen physician, if consulted, would pose a risk to subject safety or interfere&#xD;

    <ipd_time_frame>Data sharing requests relating to this study will be considered beginning 18 months after the study has ended and either 1) the product and indication have been granted marketing authorization in both the US and Europe or 2) clinical development for the product and/or indication discontinues and the data will not be submitted to regulatory authorities. There is no end date for eligibility to submit a data sharing request for this study.</ipd_time_frame>
    <ipd_access_criteria>Qualified researchers may submit a request containing the research objectives, the Amgen product(s) and Amgen study/studies in scope, endpoints/outcomes of interest, statistical analysis plan, data requirements, publication plan, and qualifications of the researcher(s). In general, Amgen does not grant external requests for individual patient data for the purpose of re-evaluating safety and efficacy issues already addressed in the product labelling. Requests are reviewed by a committee of internal advisors. If not approved, a Data Sharing Independent Review Panel will arbitrate and make the final decision. Upon approval, information necessary to address the research question will be provided under the terms of a data sharing agreement. This may include anonymized individual patient data and/or available supporting documents, containing fragments of analysis code where provided in analysis specifications.
