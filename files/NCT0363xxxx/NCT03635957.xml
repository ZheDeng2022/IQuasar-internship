    <textblock>
      The overall objective of the study is to assess the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of the concomitant use of pegloticase with methotrexate (MTX) to&#xD;
      enhance the response rate seen with pegloticase alone in adults with uncontrolled gout.&#xD;

      The study design will include: 1) up to a 2-week Screening Period (screening should be&#xD;
      complete within 2 weeks prior to Week -4), 2) a 4-week MTX Run in Period (Week - 4 through&#xD;
      Day 1); 3) a 52-week Pegloticase + IMM (immunomodulator), (Pegloticase + MTX) Period 4) a&#xD;
      Safety Follow-up (Phone/Email/Site Visit) and 5) a 3 and 6 month Post Treatment Follow-up.&#xD;
