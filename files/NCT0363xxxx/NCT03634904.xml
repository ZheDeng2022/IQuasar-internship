  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is evidence that the current dosing recommendations of ceftazidime in hemodialysis&#xD;
      patients may not reach the critical pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics thresholds associated&#xD;
      with maximal efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to assess whether the standard doses of ceftazidime (1 or 2 g)&#xD;
      administered at the end of the dialysis session (intermittent dialysis) allow to obtain a&#xD;
      trough level equal or superior to 8 mg/L if the causative organism is not identified or 1 x&#xD;
      the MIC if it is identified and its in vitro susceptibility to ceftazidime established. The&#xD;
      secondary objectives will be (i) to assess whether a trough level equal or superior to 32&#xD;
      mg/L (if the causative organism is not identified) and 4 x its MIC (if identified and its in&#xD;
      vitro susceptibility established) can be obtained; (ii) whether the criteria mentioned above&#xD;
      also apply to the free fractions of ceftazidime; (iii) to assess whether reaching the desired&#xD;
      free and total trough concentrations impacts the clinical outcome of the patient; (iv) to&#xD;
      assess whether the main hemodialysis parameters impact on ceftazidime total and free serum&#xD;
      concentrations; (v) to assess the impact of patient's residual renal function on the&#xD;
      ceftazidime serum free and total concentrations; (vi) to assess the impact of potential&#xD;
      drug-drug interactions on ceftazidime serum free and total concentrations; (vii) to assess&#xD;
      how the MIC of the causative organism (if known) affects the expected effectiveness of&#xD;
      ceftazidime.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be prospective and monocentric. Drug assay will be made High Performance&#xD;
      Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and UV photometric detection (confirmed by tandem mass&#xD;
      spectrometry detection[HPLC-MS-MS]). Free concentration will be measured after separation by&#xD;
      membrane sieving.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected number of enrolled patients will be 20 (arbitrarily chosen but compatible with&#xD;
      previous studies and the possibilities of the Institution in which the study will be&#xD;
      performed. The standard dose of ceftazidime will be (i) a loading dose of 2 g followed by a&#xD;
      maintenance dose of 1 g (the dose may be modified by the clinician in charge if deemed&#xD;
      necessary and recorded accordingly).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data obtained will be used for pharmacokinetic modelling and population pharmacokinetics,&#xD;
      followed by Monte-Carlo simulations to obtain population-wide predictions and to draw&#xD;
      conclusions that could be applicable to a larger population.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of severe infections, the first 24h of treatment are critical to limit the severity&#xD;
      and the mortality (1). Thus, the antibiotic treatment must be initiated as soon as possible,&#xD;
      be efficacious against the causative organism, and reach concentrations in the infected&#xD;
      tissues larger than the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC). In case of sepsis,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic parameters are modified (e.g., increase of the volume of distribution [Vd]),&#xD;
      increase [initially] and decrease [later] of the renal clearance), which impacts on the&#xD;
      actual concentration and activity of the antibiotic. For most antibiotics, the adaptation of&#xD;
      the dosages is performed in a very crude fashion in case of renal failure (5). A first study&#xD;
      has demonstrated that the antibiotic doses prescribed in case of sepsis were, in most of the&#xD;
      cases, insufficient to obtain a concentration of 4 times or even 1 time the MIC of the&#xD;
      causative organism during the desired fractions of the time between two successive&#xD;
      administration (70% for ceftazidime) (6). A second study has shown that the doses of&#xD;
      antibiotic prescribed in case of sepsis and of renal failure requiring extracorporeal&#xD;
      hemofiltration are insufficient (7). Both studies showed also that there is a large&#xD;
      interpatient variability in the antibiotic serum concentrations. An additional factor, rarely&#xD;
      taken into account, is that only the free fraction of the antibiotic is active (8). Yet, the&#xD;
      free fraction is rarely measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of ceftazidime in first intention probabilistic antibiotherapy in patients undergoing&#xD;
      chronic hemodialysis is supported by its broad spectrum of activity against the most&#xD;
      frequently observed organisms in this patient population, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa.&#xD;
      The low incidence of adverse effects reported for this antibiotic makes it a better choice&#xD;
      than ciprofloxacin. Moreover, its rather simple and controllable mode of administration (one&#xD;
      intravenous dose administered at the end of the dialysis period) guarantees a better&#xD;
      compliance compared to a daily oral antibiotherapy. Ceftazidime shows a low protein binding,&#xD;
      and its activity is therefore not expected to be grossly affected in patients compared to&#xD;
      what can be measured in vitro in reference media (9). However, mots reported data on&#xD;
      ceftazidime protein binding have been obtained on healthy volunteers and the extent of&#xD;
      binding of beta-lactams to serum proteins may considerably vary according to the type of&#xD;
      subjects (10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Presently, the recommendations for the dosages of ceftazidime in patients undergoing chronic&#xD;
      hemodialysis are based on rather old pharmacokinetic studies assuming a plasma half-life of&#xD;
      ceftazidime reduced to 3.3 h during hemodialysis vs. 33.6 h in anuric patients and&#xD;
      recommending to administer half of the total daily dose at the end of the hemodialysis (11).&#xD;
      But these recommendations do not take into account the progresses made since then in&#xD;
      hemodialysis techniques. The international recommendations and those of the US Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA) recommend to administer 1 g of ceftazidime after each hemodialysis&#xD;
      session (12). Different dialysis parameters modulating the level of removal of ceftazidime in&#xD;
      modern dialyzers have been studied (13). This showed that the ceftazidime clearance increases&#xD;
      with the rate of dialysis fluid flow, the ultrafiltration volume, and the urea clearance.&#xD;
      There is a positive correlation between the increase in blood flow and the ceftazidime&#xD;
      clearance that, however, is observed only in patients for whom an AN69 membrane was used&#xD;
      (14). Another study has examined the impact of the use of membranes with high permeability on&#xD;
      the pharmacodynamics of ceftazidime using mathematical modeling. This study led to a&#xD;
      recommendation that ceftazidime should be administered at a daily dose of 1 g to obtain a&#xD;
      serum trough concentration higher than the MIC of the causative (or suspected) organism&#xD;
      during at least 70% of the dosing interval. A dose of 2 g of ceftazidime after each dialysis&#xD;
      session was effective for isolates for which the MIC of ceftazidime was not superior to 16&#xD;
      mg/L (14). This study, however, is based on data collected in 1983 and included only 6&#xD;
      patients. Thus, there has been no in vivo study looking as to whether a dose of 1 or 2 g of&#xD;
      ceftazidime administered after each dialysis session is sufficient when using contemporary&#xD;
      dialysis equipment. Moreover, no measure of the free fraction has been made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will measure the ceftazidime serum concentrations in patients undergoing&#xD;
      hemodialysis (before the hemodialysis session and at the end of the hemodialysis session,)&#xD;
      and receiving standard doses of ceftazidime in order to determine whether these&#xD;
      concentrations are sufficient based on accepted literature-based criteria concerning&#xD;
      suspected or documented infections (15). The data will be confronted with the evolution of&#xD;
      the patients' clinical conditions in order to draw possible correlations between these two&#xD;
      aspects of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assess whether the standard doses of ceftazidime (1 or 2 g) administered at the end of the&#xD;
      dialysis session (intermittent dialysis) allow to obtain the following serum concentrations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the causative organism is not identified: a trough level equal or superior to 8 mg/L&#xD;
           (1 time the MIC of the least susceptible isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa based on the&#xD;
           interpretative criteria of EUCAST (European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility&#xD;
           Testing; resistance set at &gt; 8mg/L).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the causative organism is identified and MIC determined and lower or equal to 8 mg/L:&#xD;
           a trough level equal or superior to 1 time this MIC&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess whether the standard doses of ceftazidime (1 or 2 g) administered at the end of&#xD;
           the dialysis session (intermittent dialysis) allow to obtain a trough concentration at&#xD;
           32 mg/L if the causative organism is not identified and 4 times its MIC if it is&#xD;
           identified and its MIC determined and lower or equal to 8 mg/L&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess whether the criteria mentioned in the primary objectives also apply to the free&#xD;
           fractions of ceftazidime.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess whether reaching the desired free and total trough concentrations of 8 mg/L or 1&#xD;
           time the MIC impacts the clinical outcome of the patient (as judged by the attending&#xD;
           physician).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess whether reaching the desired free and total trough concentrations of 32 mg/L or 4&#xD;
           time the MIC impacts the clinical outcome of the patient (as judged by the attending&#xD;
           physician).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the impact of main hemodialysis parameters (type of membrane, flow rate of the&#xD;
           dialysis fluid, length of the dialysis session; volume of ultrafiltration) on the&#xD;
           ceftazidime total and free serum concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the impact of patient's residual renal function on the ceftazidime serum free and&#xD;
           total concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the impact of potential drug-drug interactions (based on the record of all drugs&#xD;
           administered to the patient) impact on ceftazidime serum free and total concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Asses how the MIC of the causative organism (if known) affects the expected&#xD;
           effectiveness of ceftazidime, considering both the total and the free serum&#xD;
           concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
             -  total serum concentrations in the laboratory of Biological Chemistry of the&#xD;
                hospital where the study will be conducted (CHU) using a validated High Performance&#xD;

                using an HPLC separation method and a tandem mass spectrometry (MS-MS) detection&#xD;
                method (to mitigate the risk of interferences by other drugs or metabolites in&#xD;
                abnormal quantities). Assay of the free fraction will be made after separation by&#xD;
                membrane sieving.&#xD;

           compatible with (i) previous studies indicating that it is sufficient to provide useful&#xD;
           information; (ii) the present number of patients admitted to the hospital for&#xD;
           hemodialysis per year (from 100 to 120) with a proportion of about 20% needing&#xD;
           antibiotic treatment for an infection for which ceftazidime is indicated.&#xD;

           reactive protein (mg/l), leucocytes count (/µl)); bacteriological data: clinical&#xD;
           outcome: cure - improved - failure - relapse (by the same organism), infection-related&#xD;
           adverse effects: septic metastasis, death; administration-related adverse effects:&#xD;
           catheter-clogging and infection; treatment-related adverse effects: any that could be&#xD;
           related to the drug&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  parameters of the hemodialysis: type of dialysis membrane and membrane area&#xD;
           (Polysulfone. 2 m2, 2,2m2), blood flow (ml/min (350ml/min)), dialysate flow rate (500&#xD;
           ml/min (fixed)), KT/V ratio (at 2d and 5th sessions) (1,2 to 1,5) where K = dialyzer&#xD;
           clearance of urea; T= dialysis time; V = volume of distribution of urea [approximately&#xD;
           equal to patient's total body water], access route: catheter (double lumen) or direct&#xD;
           arterio-venous connection, length of dialysis session (minutes), added solutes&#xD;

           infection by a methicillin-resistant Gram-positive organism [e.g., S. aureus or S.&#xD;
           epidermidis]), antivitamin K, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Modeling and population pharmacokinetics Serum concentration data will be analyzed using&#xD;
      appropriate softwares to determine the pertinent pharmacokinetic parameters for the&#xD;
      population of patients studied. The analysis will focus on&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  median and mean ceftazidime clearances and half-lives out of and during the dialysis&#xD;
           periods&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the extraction rate of ceftazidime during the hemodialysis sessions After establishing&#xD;
           the best model and based on Monte-Carlo simulations, the results will be used to&#xD;
           determine whether the threshold for efficacy defined above holds true when considering&#xD;
           the population of patients routinely undergoing hemodialysis. The general methodology&#xD;
           and calculations approaches will be similar to those described in previous publications&#xD;
           with adaptation if necessary (16, 17).&#xD;
