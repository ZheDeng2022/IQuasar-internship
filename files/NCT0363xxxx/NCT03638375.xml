      The ACTME study is an investigator initiated, single center phase I/II clinical trial for&#xD;
      patients with progressive unresectable stage III or stage IV melanoma. The trial consists of&#xD;
      both a phase I part to determine safety and feasibility and a phase II part to evaluate first&#xD;
      clinical activity of IFN-alpha, nivolumab and TIL. The treatment with IFN-alpha will be added&#xD;
      after the combination of TIL and nivolumab has proven to be safe.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The ACTME is an investigator initiated, single center phase I/II clinical trial for patients&#xD;
      with progressive unresectable stage III or stage IV melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are conditioned by low-dose IFN-alpha and treated with ACT and PD-1 antibodies. With&#xD;
      this approach the investigators hope to solve 4 of the most important aspects curtailing the&#xD;
      efficacy of current immunotherapies in metastatic melanoma:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the lack of sufficient numbers of activated tumor-reactive T cells in patients by&#xD;
           providing ACT; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the inhibition of T-cell effector function through PD-1 signalling by administration of&#xD;
           nivolumab; as well as&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. the toxicity of high-dose IL-2, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. long term hospitalization of patients due to the conditioning-regimen used in most ACT&#xD;
           protocols by replacing it with low-dose IFN-alpha treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial consists of both a phase I part to determine safety and feasibility and a phase II&#xD;
      part to evaluate first clinical activity of IFN-alpha, nivolumab and TIL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment with IFN-alpha will be added after the combination of TIL and nivolumab has&#xD;
      proven to be safe in the first cohort of the phase I part of the trial.&#xD;
