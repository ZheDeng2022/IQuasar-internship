  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II/III trial studies how well anamorelin hydrochloride works in reducing anorexia&#xD;
      in patients with non-small cell lung cancer that has spread to other places in the body.&#xD;
      Anamorelin hydrochloride may help to improve patients' appetite in order to stop weight loss.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To qualitatively examine experiences related to anorexia in advanced lung cancer patients&#xD;
      with anorexia-cachexia and the impact of nine weeks of treatment of oral anamorelin&#xD;
      hydrochloride (anamorelin) (100 mg) and placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To explore changes in anorexia-cachexia (measured by the Functional Assessment of&#xD;
      Anorexia/Cachexia Treatment [FAACT] anorexia/cachexia subscale [A/CS]) in patients with&#xD;
      advanced non-small cell cancer after 9 weeks of oral anamorelin (100 mg) or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To explore changes in anorexia as measured by the 5-item Anorexia Symptom score (derived&#xD;
      from the FAACT A/CS) after 9 weeks of oral anamorelin (100 mg) or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To explore any associations between changes in anorexia with body weight, body&#xD;
      composition (as assessed by InBody, weight scale, and L3 vertebrae compute tomography [CT]&#xD;
      scan), quality of life (Functional Assessment of Cancer Illness Therapy [FACT-G]), Patient&#xD;
      Global Impression of Severity (PGIS), Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC), nutritional&#xD;
      markers (pre-albumin, IGF-1 and IGFBP-3), inflammatory biomarkers (C-reactive protein [CRP],&#xD;
      monocyte IL-6&amp;R, TNF-a&amp;R, IL-10,IL-8, IL-1&amp;RA), and food intake after 9 weeks of oral&#xD;
      anamorelin (100 mg) or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive anamorelin hydrochloride orally (PO) daily for 9 weeks in the absence&#xD;
      of disease progression or unaccepted toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO daily for 9 weeks in the absence of disease progression&#xD;
      or unaccepted toxicity.&#xD;
