  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is for patients with neuroblastoma, sarcoma, uveal melanoma, breast cancer, or&#xD;
      another cancer that expresses a substance on the cancer cells called GD2. The cancer has&#xD;
      either come back after treatment or did not respond to treatment. Because there is no&#xD;
      standard treatment at this time, patients are asked to volunteer in a gene transfer research&#xD;
      study using special immune cells called T cells. T cells are a type of white blood cell that&#xD;
      helps the body fight infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The body has different ways of fighting infection and disease. No single way seems perfect&#xD;
      for fighting cancers. This research study combines two different ways of fighting cancer:&#xD;
      antibodies and T cells. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with&#xD;
      cancers. They have shown promise but have not been strong enough to cure most patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have found from previous research that we can put a new gene into T cells that will make&#xD;
      them recognize cancer cells and kill them. In our last clinical trial we made a gene called a&#xD;
      chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) from an antibody that recognizes GD2, a substance found on&#xD;
      almost all neuroblastoma cells (GD2-CAR). We put this gene into the patients' own T cells and&#xD;
      gave them back to 11 neuroblastoma patients. We saw that the cells did grow for a while, but&#xD;
      started to disappear from the blood after 2 weeks. We think that if T cells are able to last&#xD;
      longer they may have a better chance of killing GD2 positive tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, in this study we will add a new gene to the GD2 T cells that can cause the cells&#xD;
      to live longer. T cells need substances called cytokines to survive and the cells may not get&#xD;
      enough cytokines after infusion. We have added the gene C7R that gives the cells a constant&#xD;
      supply of cytokine and helps them to survive for a longer period of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In other studies using T cells, investigators found that giving chemotherapy before the T&#xD;
      cell infusion can improve the amount of time the T cells stay in the body and therefore the&#xD;
      effect the T cells can have. This is called lymphodepletion and we think that it will allow&#xD;
      the T cells to expand and stay longer in the body, and potentially kill cancer cells more&#xD;
      effectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The GD2-C7R T cells are an investigational product not approved by the Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to find the largest safe dose of GD2-C7R T cells, and also to&#xD;
      evaluate how long they can be detected in the blood and what affect they have on cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To prepare the T cells (GD2-C7R T cells), research staff will take some blood from the&#xD;
      patient. We will grow the GD2.C7R T cells by infecting the T cells with a retroviral vector&#xD;
      (a special virus that can carry a new gene into cells) containing one gene that can recognize&#xD;
      and kill cancer cells (GD2.CAR) and the new gene called C7R that will help these cells&#xD;
      survive longer. After the new genes have been put into the T cells, the cells will be tested&#xD;
      to make sure that they kill GD2-positive cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because we are growing the cells in the laboratory, we will also need to take blood to test&#xD;
      for infectious viruses such as hepatitis and HIV (the virus that causes AIDS), and we will&#xD;
      also ask patients to complete a questionnaire that is given to blood donors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cells generated will be frozen and stored to give back to the patient. Because patients&#xD;
      will have received cells with a new gene in them patients will be followed for a total of 15&#xD;
      years to see if there are any long term side effects of gene transfer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be assigned a dose of GD2-C7R T cells. The assigned dose of cells is based on&#xD;
      body weight and height.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, patients will receive the GD2-C7R cells and may also receive cyclophosphamide&#xD;
      and fludarabine. These two drugs are standard chemotherapy medicines and may be given before&#xD;
      the T cells to make space in the blood for the T cells to grow after receiving them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient receives cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, these drugs will be given&#xD;
      intravenously (through an i.v. needle inserted in a vein or a central line) for 2 days and&#xD;
      then fludarabine alone on the third day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be given an injection of GD2-C7R T cells into the vein through an IV line at&#xD;
      the assigned dose. Before receiving the T cell infusion, the patient may be given a dose of&#xD;
      Benadryl (diphenhydramine) and Tylenol (acetaminophen). The infusion will take between 1 and&#xD;
      10 minutes. We will then monitor the patient in the clinic for about 3 hours. The treatment&#xD;
      will be given by the Center for Cell and Gene Therapy at Texas Children's Hospital or Houston&#xD;
      Methodist Hospital. The patient may need to stay in Houston for up to 4 weeks after the&#xD;
      infusion so we can monitor for side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will have follow-up visits after the T cell infusion at weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8,&#xD;
      then at months 3, 6, 9, and 12, and then twice a year for the next 4 years and annually for&#xD;
      the next 10 years for a total of 15 years. The patient will also have scheduled disease&#xD;
      evaluations after the T-cell injection at week 6 and then as clinically needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After disease re-evaluation, if the patient's disease has not gotten worse, or if in the&#xD;
      future it seems the patient might benefit AND the patient has not had a severe side effect&#xD;
      caused by the infusion of the GD2-C7R T cells, the patient may be eligible to receive one&#xD;
      additional dose of their T cells. The dose will be at the same dose level as the first&#xD;
      infusion and separated by at least 6 weeks such that we can make sure the patient has no&#xD;
      severe side effects between infusions. If the patient receives an additional dose of GD2-C7R&#xD;
      T-cells, then they will need to stay in Houston for up to 4 weeks after the infusion as well&#xD;
      so we can monitor for side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical tests before treatment--&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before being treated, the patient will receive a series of standard medical tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver function&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurements of the tumor by routine imaging studies and/or bone marrow evaluation. We&#xD;
           will use the imaging studies that have been used in the past to best assess the tumor&#xD;
           (Computer Tomogram (CT) or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), and Positron Emission&#xD;
           Tomography (PET/CT), Bone Scan, and/or MIBG scan)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pulmonary Function Tests (PFT) to see how well your lungs are working&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical tests during and after treatment--&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will receive standard medical tests when they are getting the infusions and&#xD;
      afterwards:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exams&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver function&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurements of the tumor by routine imaging studies and/or bone marrow evaluation 6&#xD;
           weeks after the infusion (if the bone marrow showed tumor before the infusion).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn more about the way the GD2-C7R T cells are working and how long they last in the&#xD;
      body, an extra amount of blood will be obtained on the day that chemotherapy starts, the day&#xD;
      of the T-cell infusion(s) and at the end of the T-cell infusion(s), 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks&#xD;
      after the T-cell infusion(s) and every 3 months for the 1st year, every 6 months for the next&#xD;
      4 years and annually for the next 10 years. The amount of blood taken will be based on weight&#xD;
      with up to a maximum of 60 ml (12 teaspoons) of blood to be obtained at any one time. For&#xD;
      children, the total amount of blood drawn will not be more than 3 ml (less than 1 teaspoon)&#xD;
      per 1 kg of body weight on any one day. This volume is considered safe, but may be decreased&#xD;
      if the patient is anemic (has a low red blood cell count).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the time points listed above, if the GD2-C7R T cells are found in the patient's blood&#xD;
      at a certain amount, an extra 5 ml (about 1 teaspoon) of blood may need to be collected for&#xD;
      additional testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient has a procedure where tumor samples are obtained, like a repeat bone marrow&#xD;
      evaluation or tumor biopsy, we will request a sample to be used for research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will receive supportive care for any acute or chronic toxicities, including blood&#xD;
      components or antibiotics, and other intervention as appropriate.&#xD;

             poor lung function based on PFT testing (Patients with FEV 1, FVC and DLCO/diffusion&#xD;
             capacity &lt; 50%) will not be eligible for treatment on protocol. Patients with&#xD;
             intermediate function (FEV 1, FVC and DLCO/diffusion capacity ≥ 50% and &lt; 70%&#xD;
             predicted) will require assessment by a pulmonologist prior to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Evidence of tumor potentially causing airway obstruction&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients must not be pregnant, lactating, or unwilling to use birth control&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients must not be currently receiving immunosuppressive drugs such as&#xD;
             corticosteroids (prednisone dose of &gt; 0.25 mg/kg/day or equivalent), tacrolimus or&#xD;
             cyclosporine&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Active autoimmune disease (requiring immunosuppressive treatment in the past 6 months)&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Primary brain tumor or known brain metastases (on evaluation by MIBG and/or PET if&#xD;
             applicable, CT/MRI/LP not required)&#xD;
