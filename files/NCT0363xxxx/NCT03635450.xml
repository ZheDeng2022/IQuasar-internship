  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety of one and two intravenous infusions of&#xD;
      human umbilical cord tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (hCT-MSC), the first&#xD;
      administered in the first 48 postnatal hours, and the second at two months postnatal age, in&#xD;
      term and near term infants with moderate to severe neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy&#xD;
      (HIE). This is a phase I, prospective, open-label trial designed to assess the safety of one&#xD;
      or two intravenous doses of hCT-MSC in newborn infants with moderate to severe HIE who are&#xD;
      recipients of therapeutic hypothermia. Infants born at 36 0/7 weeks gestation or later who&#xD;
      have moderate to severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy and are receiving therapeutic&#xD;
      hypothermia will be eligible to participate. Investigators project an accrual of 6 patients.&#xD;
      All infants will receive intravenous infusion(s) of hCT-MSCs. The first cohort of three&#xD;
      infants will receive a single dose in the first 48 postnatal hours. If there are no safety&#xD;
      concerns, the second cohort of three infants will receive two doses, with the first dose&#xD;
      given in the first 48 postnatal hours and the second dose given approximately two months&#xD;
      after the first dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The potential risks associated with infusion of MSCs include a reaction to the product (rash,&#xD;
      shortness of breath, wheezing, difficulty breathing, hypotension, swelling around the mouth,&#xD;
      throat or eyes, tachycardia, diaphoresis), transmission of infection, and HLA sensitization.&#xD;
      Another risk of this study is loss of confidentiality or privacy. Every effort will be made&#xD;
      to keep the infant's medical record confidential. The results will be summarized using&#xD;
      descriptive statistics and statistical testing as appropriate. Continuous secondary endpoints&#xD;
      will be summarized using mean, standard deviation, CV%, median, minimum, and maximum.&#xD;

    <description>Infants who meet enrollment criteria for moderate to severe hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy will receive 1 infusion of hCT-MSC within the first 48 postnatal hours. hCT-MSCs are a product of allogeneic cells manufactured from digested umbilical cord tissue that is expanded in culture, cryopreserved and banked. hCT-MSCs are manufactured from umbilical cord tissue donated to the Carolinas Cord Blood Bank, an FDA-licensed, FACT-accredited, public cord blood bank at Duke University Medical Center, after written informed consent from the baby's mother. Cord tissue is harvested from the placentas of male babies delivered by elective C-section after a normal, full- term pregnancy.</description>
