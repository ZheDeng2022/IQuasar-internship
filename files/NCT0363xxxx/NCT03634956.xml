  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thyroidectomy is a frequently performed surgeon by the head and neck and endocrine surgeons.&#xD;
      In recent years, surgical techniques and technological developments have resulted in a&#xD;
      significant reduction in complication rates. Despite these advances, there is still a great&#xD;
      deal of anxiety about the sound problems that can be experienced in patients after surgery.&#xD;
      In the past years,the investigators have tried to prevent recurrent nerve paralysis by using&#xD;
      intraoperative nerve monitoring (IONM). The use of IONM has begun to be preferred by many&#xD;
      surgeons in the investigator's country. However, the use of IONM decreases the number of&#xD;
      recurrent nerve paralysis are still being discussed and many studies have been done. In this&#xD;
      study, it is aimed to prevent the formation of recurrent nerve paralysis in order to safely&#xD;
      carry out the IONM by removing the effects of neuromuscular blockade drugs using sugammadex&#xD;
      sodium medicine in the thyroidectomy operations.&#xD;

      Patients who will undergo thyroidectomy using the IONM in the General Surgery Clinic of&#xD;
      Istanbul, Bakırköy Dr.Sadi Konuk Training and Research Hospital. In this prospective&#xD;
      observational clinical trial, the patients will be divided into two groups and the study will&#xD;
      be performed as randomize. Randomization Patients who arrive consecutively, will be included&#xD;
      in the study group (Group I IONM, group B IONM-sugammadex sodium). In both groups, anesthesia&#xD;
      induction should be done with 3 mg / kg propofol, 2 ugr / kg fentanyl, 0.6 mg / kg rocuronium&#xD;
      bromide, as the intubation tube, the number appropriate for the patient, After reaching the&#xD;
      throat loom, the patient is entrapped and then the operation is started. After reaching the&#xD;
      thyroid loin and hanging the throid with the swab sutures, the lobe is taken out with the&#xD;
      finger maneuver and then the vascular nerve packet is dissected and the vagal nerve is&#xD;
      exposed. IONM(Medtronic-NIM) were detected in the recurrent nerve thyroglossal groove and 100&#xD;
      microvolts or more were measured with nerve monitoring. + Acceptance of resection was started&#xD;
      and IONM After the intubation of the group B-sugammadex sodium was started, the left hand&#xD;
      ulnar sinus TOF-Guard device was placed and operation started. After reaching the thyroid&#xD;
      loops and hanging the throids with hanging sutures and removing the lobe with finger&#xD;
      maneuver, the vascular nerve was disassembled and the vagal nerve was dislocated. Then the&#xD;
      electrical value was recorded with IONM and sugammadex sodium 2 mg / kg was made. and the TOF&#xD;
      response at 4th minute is over 90% of the value to be measured and if the IONM is 100&#xD;
      microvolts higher, the recurrent nerve is found in the troglossal groove and the nerve is&#xD;
      followed with the IONM and the resection procedure is started and the tirodidectomy will be&#xD;
      performed. V0: vagal nerve initial value; V1: value before troid resection; V2: value after&#xD;
      troid resection; R1: value after troid resection, R2: value after troid resection.&#xD;
      Preoperative and postoperative vocal cord examination will be examined by otolaryngologist.&#xD;
      Size, weight, sex, ASA scores, operation times, complications will be recorded. If there is&#xD;
      no signal in RLN with intraoperative IONM and RLN paralysis will be accepted if there is&#xD;
      inactivity in the vocal cord at the 1st postoperative ENT specialist vocal cord examinations.&#xD;
      RLN paralysis will be accepted if there is inactivity in the cord at the vocal cord&#xD;
      examination of the postoperative specialist ENT specialist. The ENT specialist and general&#xD;
      surgeon will follow up and if the vocal cord is still in motion, the permanent RLN will be&#xD;
      considered a paralysis.&#xD;
