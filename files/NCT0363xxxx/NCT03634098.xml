  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Metabolic diseases of the liver are silent affections whose morbidity is important. About 70%&#xD;
      of patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) are concerned. Of these, 50% develop clinically&#xD;
      significant lesions (including non-alcoholic steatohepatitis or NASH) as they are associated&#xD;
      with an increased risk of complications; and 15% progress to severe fibrosis or cirrhosis.&#xD;
      These diseases are slowly progressive and asymptomatic. Their pathophysiology is poorly&#xD;
      known. Management is hampered by the absence of a specific diagnostic marker, the need for&#xD;
      invasive diagnostic procedures (liver biopsy), and the lack of established treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      QUID-NASH aims to develop a virtual liver biopsy in T2D participants, based on the&#xD;
      identification of single or combined, multimodal, non-invasive biomarkers obtained by new&#xD;
      quantitative imaging techniques (magnetic resonance and ultrafast ultrasound UFUS); and /or&#xD;
      extensive clinical-biological phenotyping data; and/or data obtained by different omic&#xD;
      approaches (metabolomics, targeted genetics, transcriptomics). Extracellular vesicle and&#xD;
      immune cell profiling will complement these phenotyping data. This approach will also enable&#xD;
      us to improve our understanding of pathophysiology (new signaling pathways, new therapeutic&#xD;
      targets).&#xD;

      Metabolic diseases of the liver are silent affections whose morbidity is important. About 70%&#xD;
      of patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) are concerned. Of these, 50% develop clinically&#xD;
      significant lesions (including non-alcoholic steatohepatitis or NASH) as they are associated&#xD;
      with an increased risk of complications; and 15% progress to severe fibrosis or cirrhosis.&#xD;
      These diseases are slowly progressive and asymptomatic. Their pathophysiology is poorly&#xD;
      known. Management is hampered by the absence of a specific diagnostic marker, the need for&#xD;
      invasive diagnostic procedures (liver biopsy), and the lack of established treatment.&#xD;
      Non-invasive methods (&quot;first-generation&quot; tests) have recently seen significant growth:&#xD;
      commercialization of FibroTest as a marker of fibrosis; FibroTest, Fibrometer and FibroScan,&#xD;
      for the initial assessment of adult chronic hepatitis C; FibroTest, Fibrometer, and Enhanced&#xD;
      Liver Fibrosis test (ELF-test) for diagnosis of metabolic liver disease and diagnosis of&#xD;
      fibrosis; SteatoTest (APHP patent) for the diagnosis of steatosis. The ActiTest (APHP patent)&#xD;
      is widely used in evaluating the necrotic-inflammatory activity of chronic viral hepatitis C&#xD;
      and B. For the diagnosis of NASH alone the ActiTest is validated. The NashTest (APHP patent)&#xD;
      is little used. Several biomarkers of imaging (liver ultrasound, FibroScan Controller&#xD;
      Attenuated Parameter (CAP), elastography and nuclear magnetic resonance) are widely used for&#xD;
      the diagnosis of steatosis. Two new &quot;second generation&quot; blood tests (APHP patents) are under&#xD;
      development, Non Invasive Test-NASHr (NIT-NASHr), and NIT-A2F2. NIT-NASHr is a new&#xD;
      combination of the components of SteatoTest and NASH-Test to assess the severity of NASH.&#xD;
      NIT-A2F2 is a combination of NIT-NASHr and FibroTest for the diagnosis of clinically&#xD;
      significant liver metabolic disease. These tests will be the subject in the project of a&#xD;
      validation of their performances in the context of use (T2D without other liver disease). At&#xD;
      the same time, significant progress has been made in integrating omic data to characterize&#xD;
      various pathologies and to identify their mechanisms. The transcriptomics and metabolomics of&#xD;
      body fluids are particularly promising for the construction of &quot;third generation&quot; tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      QUID-NASH aims to develop a virtual liver biopsy in T2D participants, based on the&#xD;
      identification of single or combined, multimodal, non-invasive biomarkers obtained by new&#xD;
      quantitative imaging techniques (magnetic resonance and ultrafast ultrasound UFUS); and / or&#xD;
      extensive clinical-biological phenotyping data; and / or data obtained by different omic&#xD;
      approaches (metabolomics, targeted genetics, transcriptomics). Extracellular vesicle and&#xD;
      immune cell profiling will complement this data. This approach will also enable us to improve&#xD;
      knowledge of the pathology (new signaling pathways, new therapeutic targets).&#xD;
