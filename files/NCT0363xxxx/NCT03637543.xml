  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying an immune-based cancer drug as a possible treatment for&#xD;
      prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drug involved in this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Nivolumab&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a&#xD;
      specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved nivolumab for this specific&#xD;
      disease but it has been approved for other uses. Nivolumab is an antibody inhibitor of the&#xD;
      programmed death-1 (PD-1) pathway. By blocking PD-1, this medication may allow the immune&#xD;
      system to recognize and fight cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the investigators are investigating whether nivolumab has any&#xD;
      activity in patients who have a rising PSA (prostate specific antigen) after previously&#xD;
      undergoing surgery or radiation for prostate cancer. Although nivolumab was previously not&#xD;
      found to have significant effect in advanced prostate cancer after all other therapies had&#xD;
      failed, based on new research, the investigators are testing whether nivolumab could have a&#xD;
      greater effect earlier in the disease course and before patients receive hormone therapies.&#xD;
