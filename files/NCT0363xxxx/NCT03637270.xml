  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke patients usually have difficulties with moving and are venerable to secondary problems&#xD;
      such as sarcopenia and strength loss. These problems may accelerate the disability process&#xD;
      during aging. It is well known that exercise helps to maintain or promote human fitness. This&#xD;
      study is conducted to explore the beneficial effects of exercise and protein supplement on&#xD;
      fitness and body composition among patients with chronic stroke.&#xD;

      This is a multicenter randomized control trial. Participants will be recruited from 4&#xD;
      teaching hospitals in Taipei. Participants are randomly assigned to 2 groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. protein supplementation + exercise (PRO group);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. carbohydrate supplementation + exercise (CHO group);&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 1-hour exercise intervention includes aerobic cycling exercise followed by progressive&#xD;
      resisted exercise with TheraBand. PRO group receives PS immediately before and after the&#xD;
      exercise while the CHO group receive sham product (the same calories with no protein). The&#xD;
      Interventions are arranged 3 sessions a week for 10 weeks. The outcome measurements are&#xD;
      performed at 0-week, 10-week, and 20-week.&#xD;
