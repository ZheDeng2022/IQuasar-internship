  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to examine if a shorter palliative radiotherapy fractionation scheme&#xD;
      of 20 Gy / 4 F can reduce the early oesophageal toxicity compared to 30 Gy / 10 F in patients&#xD;
      with lung cancer in performance status (PS) 0-2. Secondary aims are to examine the effect on&#xD;
      lung cancer symptoms, quality of life (QoL) and survival. Furthermore, the investigators aim&#xD;
      at standardizing the quality of palliative thoracic radiotherapy in all Danish centres at the&#xD;
      highest technical level.&#xD;

      1. Background 1.1 Radiotherapy in lung cancer Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the&#xD;
           leading cause of cancer-related death in both men and women [1]. In stage IV disease&#xD;
           platinum-based chemotherapy yields a median overall survival (OS) of 8-10 months [2].&#xD;
           When diagnosed, more than 50% of the patients have distant metastases. Forty percent&#xD;
           have signs or symptoms originating from the thorax: dyspnoea, cough, haemoptysis,&#xD;
           recurrent pneumonia or chest pain [3]. Palliative thoracic radiotherapy can relieve&#xD;
           symptoms originating from intra-thoracic malignancy and improves quality of life (QoL)&#xD;
           in approximately one third of patients [4]. It is increasingly used in daily clinical&#xD;
           practice as an alternative to chemotherapy in patients without local symptoms with the&#xD;
           purpose of prolonging life and avoiding local thoracic symptoms. In addition, palliative&#xD;
           radiotherapy is used to relieve symptoms before initiating systemic treatment&#xD;
           (chemotherapy, targeted agents, immune therapy, etc). In this latter case, it is&#xD;
           important not to delay the systemic treatment unnecessary with long schedules of&#xD;
           radiotherapy. An optimal radiotherapy regimen will thus palliate symptoms with minimal&#xD;
           toxicity and consider the patient's time investment, as well as be compatible with any&#xD;
           additional treatments given. In a recent retrospective study of 159 consecutive Danish&#xD;
           NSCLC patients who received palliative thoracic radiotherapy (2010-11) median survival&#xD;
           was 4.2 months. One third of the patients died within two months and 22% within 30 days&#xD;
           [5]. This further underlines the importance of not subjecting patients to prolonged,&#xD;
           toxic treatments in their final year of life. A recent Cochrane review [6] found that&#xD;
           there was no consistent evidence to support that longer, more fractionated radiotherapy&#xD;
           regimens gave better or more durable palliation than shorter regimens. Furthermore,&#xD;
           there was no significant survival advantage associated with longer regimens with higher&#xD;
           biological radiation doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The most common acute toxicity is oesophagitis. It is often not technically possible to&#xD;
           avoid high dose exposure to the oesophagus because of the target localization in&#xD;
           proximity to the mediastinum. Radiation-induced oesophagitis is most often a reversible&#xD;
           condition. However, it compromises swallowing due to pain, causes weight loss and&#xD;
           deterioration of the performance state (PS) and QoL at a vulnerable time for the&#xD;
           patient, and it may impact the possibility of receiving further anti-neoplastic&#xD;
           treatment. The Cochrane review found that up to 50% of patients receiving palliative&#xD;
           thoracic radiotherapy reported severe oesophagitis. The studies differed widely in terms&#xD;
           of physician- or patient self-assessment, timing, and the method used, and no overall&#xD;
           judgement could be made. The review concluded that toxicity was comparable between&#xD;
           different radiotherapy regimens. However, recording and reporting of early toxicity was&#xD;
           lacking in the included studies. This absence of early toxicity data means that the&#xD;
           current evidence is insufficient for clinical decision making in this patient group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study design The patients will be invited to participate in the study prior to&#xD;
           initiation of palliative radiotherapy. After signing informed consent the patients will&#xD;
           be randomized 1:1 between two different radiotherapy dose fractionations: 30 Gy/10 F or&#xD;
           20 Gy/4 F. Physicians and patients will not be blinded to the randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.1 Systemic therapy Patients can receive chemotherapy, immunotherapy and targeted&#xD;
           therapy during radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.2 Study sample size and time frame According to the Danish Lung Cancer Registry, 50%&#xD;
           of the 4700 lung cancer patients diagnosed yearly are in advanced stage. Of these, one&#xD;
           third is supposed to benefit from palliative thoracic radiotherapy and of these, 400&#xD;
           patients (~50%) are expected to be enrolled on the trial each year. Since 1184&#xD;
           consecutive patients are required (see chapter 7) the study is expected to enrol&#xD;
           patients over a 3-year period. Given the declared support of all Danish radiotherapy&#xD;
           centres, this is considered a realistic time frame.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Following study closure, 3 weeks of follow-up after radiotherapy initiation will be&#xD;
           allowed for all patients, at which point data will be collected for primary analysis.&#xD;
           Further analysis will be performed 1 and 3 years after the last patient is enrolled.&#xD;
           Data will be kept in databases 15 years after the last patient is included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Radiotherapy treatment planning 3.1 Target and organs at risk The gross tumour volume&#xD;
           (GTV) is defined by the referring oncologist based on a planning CT scan, and if&#xD;
           available, a diagnostic PET/CT scan. The oncologist will note in the CRF if the GTV&#xD;
           fully or only partially encompass all active malignant disease in the thorax. The&#xD;
           clinical target volume (CTV) is identical to the GTV, and thus not delineated.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Spinal cord or spinal canal, total lung, heart and the oesophagus are delineated for all&#xD;
           patients based on the guidelines in [5,6]. The heart is cranially limited defined by the&#xD;
           division of truncus pulmonalis. The oesophagus is delineated from cartilago criocoideum&#xD;
           to the gastro-oesophageal junction.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.2 Dose planning Patients are treated with conformal treatment plans, conventional or&#xD;
           intensity-modulated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Treatment verification and quality assurance 4.1 Verification of treatment position&#xD;
           Daily imaging must be performed and used for daily correction of treatment position.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Participants Patients with lung cancer stage III-IV not suitable for curative treatment,&#xD;
           being referred for palliative radiotherapy either alone or in addition to systemic&#xD;
           treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.1 Evaluations during treatment and follow up 5.1.1 Expected side effects Palliative RT&#xD;
           comes with a risk of side-effects including fatigue, pain and soreness in the throat and&#xD;
           chest, reddening of the skin in the irradiated area and dry cough and dyspnoea.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.1.2 Scoring of symptoms and QoL Symptom scores on oesophagitis, cough, pain, dyspnoea,&#xD;
           bronchopulmonary haemorrhage, performance status and QoL will be registered at baseline,&#xD;
           end of treatment, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 8-10 weeks and 6 months after radiotherapy&#xD;
           completion. If the patient has symptoms which need clinical assessment, the patient will&#xD;
           get an appointment with a physician. All complication (side effects) will be evaluated&#xD;
           according to the NCI-CTCAE v 5.0 during all follow-up visits or calls [7]. See appendix&#xD;
           C for an overview of the CTCAE v 5.0. Table 6.1 shows the evaluation plan for the trial.&#xD;
           Symptom scores on oesophagitis, cough, pain, dyspnoea, bronchopulmonary haemorrhage, and&#xD;
           assessment of performance status will be registered during the patient on-site visit at&#xD;
           baseline, end of treatment, 8-10 weeks after treatment and 6 months after treatment&#xD;
           completion. At 2 weeks and 3 weeks, symptom scores will be registered by a phone call.&#xD;
           Questionnaires for registration of QoL will be filled in on-site by the patient at&#xD;
           baseline, end of treatment, 8-10 weeks after completion of treatment and 6 months after&#xD;
           completion of treatment. In addition, two questionnaires for registration of QoL to be&#xD;
           filled in 2 weeks and 3 weeks after completion of treatment will be handed out at end of&#xD;
           treatment. During the phone calls at 2 weeks and 3 weeks, the patient will be reminded&#xD;
           to fill in the questionnaire. The questionnaires will be collected at the on-site visit&#xD;
           at 8-10 weeks after treatment. One or both phonecalls at 2 weeks and 3 weeks may be&#xD;
           substituted by on site visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
           After the end of the study-specified visit, patients will be seen every 3rd month&#xD;
           according to the guidelines by the Danish Health Authorities. Evaluation of toxicity&#xD;
           will be performed at every occasion. End of study is 3 years after commencement of&#xD;
           radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.2 Quality of Life To examine the participants' quality of life (QoL) during follow up,&#xD;
           they will be asked to fill in a QoL questionnaire. The EuroQoL 5D (EQ-5D-5L)&#xD;
           questionnaire will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Statistical considerations and planned data analyses 6.1 Sample size calculation for&#xD;
           primary endpoint - acute oesophagitis The primary study endpoint is reduction in early&#xD;
           oesophageal toxicity, as assessed two weeks after completion of radiotherapy. The&#xD;
           investigators assume that 50% of patients who receive the standard treatment (30 Gy in&#xD;
           10 fractions) will experience grade 2 or worse oesophagitis, compared to their baseline&#xD;
           prior to treatment. A reduction in acute toxicity of 10%-point with the experimental&#xD;
           treatment (odds ratio between arms of 0.67) will be clinically meaningful and will&#xD;
           justify a change of practice for this patient group. This corresponds to an expected 40%&#xD;
           rate of acute oesophagitis in the experimental arm. With 90% power and a 2-sided type 1&#xD;
           error rate of 5%, 1184 patients will be required (assuming 1:1 allocations between&#xD;
           treatment arms, and incorporating a 10% loss to follow-up). There are some clinical&#xD;
           indications that oesophageal-related toxicity will mainly be seen in patients with&#xD;
           centrally located tumours (where palliative radiotherapy results in irradiation of&#xD;
           mediastinal structures). These patients make up approximately two thirds of the&#xD;
           palliative radiotherapy patient population. An incidence of oesophagitis of 70% in these&#xD;
           patients (and ~10% in patients with peripheral tumours) is consistent with the observed&#xD;
           overall toxicity rate. Enrolling 790 patients with central tumours in the study will&#xD;
           result in &gt;95% power to detect a 15%-point reduction of toxicity in this subgroup, from&#xD;
           70% to 55% (consistent with an overall reduction of 10%, assuming very limited effect in&#xD;
           patients with peripheral tumours). Alternatively, there will be nearly 80% power to&#xD;
           detect a 10%-point toxicity reduction in the central tumour subgroup. Any such subgroup&#xD;
           analyses will be completely exploratory. All sample size and power calculations for the&#xD;
           primary endpoint are based on two-group chi-squared tests (continuity corrected) of&#xD;
           equal proportions.&#xD;
&#xD;
           6.2 Non-inferiority of overall survival Current best evidence indicates that overall&#xD;
           survival should not be different with shorter compared to longer palliative treatment&#xD;
           regimens, although the literature is not conclusive. The proposed study will have the&#xD;
           power to test for non-inferiority of the short (experimental) treatment arm compared to&#xD;
           the standard treatment: Assuming a median OS of 4.2 months, inclusion of 1184 patients&#xD;
           over 3 years (with one year of additional follow-up) will give approximately 90% power&#xD;
           to test that median OS in the experimental arm is at most 3 weeks shorter than in the&#xD;
           standard arm (one-sided significance level of 95%). Power calculations for overall&#xD;
           survival are based on Cox's proportional hazards model.&#xD;
&#xD;
           6.3 Planned data analyses All analyses will be conducted on an intention to treat (ITT)&#xD;
           basis. The primary endpoint analysis will take place once all enrolled patients have&#xD;
           reached the primary endpoint assessment (2 weeks after completion of radiotherapy). A&#xD;
           multivariate logistic regression model will be used to compare rates of grade 2+ acute&#xD;
           oesophagitis in the two treatment arms, adjusted for stratification factors. Robustness&#xD;
           of the primary endpoint to the timing of oesophagitis assessment will be examined in&#xD;
           secondary analyses, comparing the two arms with respect to oesophagitis rates at 3 weeks&#xD;
           after end of therapy as well as oesophagitis rates at 4 weeks after the start of therapy&#xD;
           (two weeks after end of therapy in the standard arm and three weeks after end of therapy&#xD;
           in the experimental arm). Significance testing will be two-sided, with a 95%&#xD;
           significance level.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Analysis of secondary endpoints will depend on the follow-up required for each endpoint;&#xD;
           with most endpoints (QoL, response assessment) available at the time of primary&#xD;
           analysis, and initial analysis of overall survival conducted one year after&#xD;
           randomisation of the final patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
           6.4 Randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients are stratified prior to randomization by treatment institution,&#xD;
                performance status 0/1 versus 2, and histology (small cell carcinoma vs squamos&#xD;
                cell carcinoma vs non-squamos cell carcinoma).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients will be randomized 1:1 between the two different radiotherapy dose&#xD;
                fractionations&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Complications All complication (side effects) will be evaluated according to the&#xD;
           NCI-CTCAE v 5.0 during all followup visits.&#xD;
