  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are limited data regarding the biology and treatment of TFE Renal Cell Carcinoma (TFE&#xD;
      RCC). This project provides the infrastructure for acquisition of biological specimens,&#xD;
      imaging, and correlative clinical data to facilitate biology studies and characterization of&#xD;
      TFE RCC. This registry will collect clinical, demographic, and pathological data, specimens&#xD;
      (as available) and imaging from patients with TFE RCC, prospectively. Cases are identified&#xD;
      through:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Existing clinical and/or cancer registry databases&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Referrals from clinicians, surgeons, or pathologists&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Families initiating contact with Registry staff directly&#xD;

      The following data/materials will be collected for this registry study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Data: Demographic data, date of diagnosis, pathology, radiological imaging at&#xD;
      diagnosis and relapse, signs and symptoms at diagnosis, molecular and biological data,&#xD;
      staging details including sites of disease, detailed treatment data (e.g. types and dates of&#xD;
      surgeries/interventional therapy (if any), medical/systemic therapy, radiotherapy), response&#xD;
      to treatment, dates of progression, types of progression (local or metastatic), and follow-up&#xD;
      data. The demographic and clinical data collected are abstracted and entered into an&#xD;
      electronic data system secured by password protection (see section 4.3.3). Collection of&#xD;
      existing molecular and/or genomic data or analysis that has been performed will also be&#xD;
      included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Specimens:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tissue (fresh/frozen/FFPE) will be requested for all enrolled patients and sent for central&#xD;
      review to study pathologist. Then tissue will be stored at CCHMC and future research testing&#xD;
      may be conducted on this tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optional research specimens:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pending consent specification of family/patient, and resources, specimens may be sent&#xD;
      directly to collaborating laboratories to proceed with tumor modeling and drug testing, or&#xD;
      other translational research with PI or designee via an IRB approved project.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumor Modeling (Fresh, frozen,): Prospectively collect or retain left-over tumor tissue&#xD;
           samples and normal tissue (background kidney) as available, for research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood: prospectively collected at time of enrollment and at time of relapse&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine: prospectively collected at time of enrollment and at time of relapse&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Saliva: prospectively collected at time of or at one time point after at time of&#xD;
           enrollment and at time of relapse&#xD;
&#xD;
      Registry clinical data will be correlated with biological/bioinformatic and genomic data.&#xD;
      Data stored in the Registry may be used to provide statistical data for scientific&#xD;
      presentations and for preparation of peer-reviewed manuscripts. For such purposes all data&#xD;
      will be de-identified. Beyond tumor model development and new agent drug testing (if selected&#xD;
      in the consent process), data and specimens will be released for IRB approved research&#xD;
      proposals upon approval from the TFE RCC Steering Committee.&#xD;
