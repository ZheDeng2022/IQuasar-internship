      This trial will be conducted with the aim to investigate the dermal response (skin&#xD;
      irritation, sensitization) and the adhesion of Ibuprofen 200 mg TEPI Medicated Plaster as&#xD;
      compared to a Placebo TEPI Plaster in two phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Induction Phase: multiple dose application of one active and one placebo plaster on 5&#xD;
      consecutive days in which the plasters remain in place for 23 hours ± 30 min a day and&#xD;
      Challenge Phase: single dose application of one active and one placebo plaster which remain&#xD;
      in place for 48 hours ± 30 min.&#xD;
