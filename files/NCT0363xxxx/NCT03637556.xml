  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multicenter, open-label, two-period crossover design that evaluates the&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary evidence of iron chelating activity of&#xD;
      DST-0509 as compared to Jadenu and Exjade in transfusion-dependent thalassemia patients with&#xD;
      transfusional iron overload, requiring iron chelation therapy and demonstrating an inadequate&#xD;
      response to Jadenu or Exjade for greater than 3 months duration. Up to 36 patients will be&#xD;
      evaluated (18 in each treatment arm), however, the balanced randomization may enroll fewer&#xD;
      patients based on recruitment status.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label, two-period cross-over, patient-pilot study comparing&#xD;
      DST-0509 to patient's prior ICT (Exjade or Jadenu) administered orally once daily (QD) for&#xD;
      28-days in each period, with a 6-day washout before the first treatment period, between&#xD;
      treatment periods, and at the end of the study before patients recommence their prescription&#xD;
      regimens. Patients will be randomized to one of two treatment sequences: DST&#xD;
      0509→Exjade/Jadenu or Exjade/Jadenu→DST-0509 (with subjects who were taking Exjade prior to&#xD;
      study start receiving Exjade and those taking Jadenu at study start receiving Jadenu). This&#xD;
      study is designed to assess the safety, tolerability, evidence of iron chelating activity,&#xD;
      and PK profile of DST-0509 compared to Jadenu or Exjade in inadequately responding patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 36 patients will be randomized 1:1 into one of two treatment sequences (study arms), of&#xD;
      which up to 100% may be on Jadenu or Exjade at study entry, or a mix of the two. The planned&#xD;
      randomization will assign up to 18 patients in each of two sequences: Sequence A: DST-0509&#xD;
      crossed to Exjade or Jadenu; Sequence B: Jadenu or Exjade crossed to DST-0509. The comparator&#xD;
      treatment will be the patient's current chelation treatment. At the end of the study,&#xD;
      patients previously on Jadenu or Exjade will revert to receiving their pre-study medication&#xD;
      and dose following a 6-day washout period. A sufficient number of patients will be enrolled&#xD;
      so there will be no need to replace study drop-outs. Study duration is approximately 14 weeks&#xD;
      for each patient.&#xD;

    <description>Exjade is commercially available as tablets and Exjade as tablets for oral suspension and will be provided by the patient with their ongoing prescription. Dosing will be at equivalent (mg for mg) doses of DST-0509 or Jadenu. If converting from Exjade, the dose will be scaled for each treatment by 28 mg/40 mg (treatment/Exjade). Jadenu and Exjade are taken once daily, Jadenu is taken with or without a light meal, and Exjade is recommended to be taken without food. However, either Jadenu or Exjade can be administered according to the patient's current prescription regimen.
