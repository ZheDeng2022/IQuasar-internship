    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate the non-inferiority of the antibody&#xD;
      responses to meningococcal serogroups A, C, W, and Y in terms of hSBA vaccine seroprotection&#xD;
      (antibody titer ≥ 1:8) when MenACYW conjugate vaccine is administered concomitantly with&#xD;
      Bexsero® in the second year of life compared to when MenACYW conjugate vaccine is given alone&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to compare the hSBA antibody response in terms of geometric mean&#xD;
      titers (GMTs) against meningococcal serogroups A, C, W, and Y when MenACYW conjugate vaccine&#xD;
      is administered concomitantly with Bexsero® or when MenACYW conjugate vaccine is given alone&#xD;
      in the second year of life; to describe the hSBA and rSBA antibody responses against&#xD;
      meningococcal serogroups A, C, W, and Y before and after the 1st dose of MenACYW conjugate&#xD;
      vaccine administered at 3 months of age, before and after the 2nd dose of MenACYW conjugate&#xD;
      vaccine administered at 12 to 13 months of age for Group 1 and Group 2; to describe the hSBA&#xD;
      and rSBA antibody persistence against meningococcal serogroups A, C, W, and Y after the 1st&#xD;
      dose of MenACYW conjugate vaccine administered at 3 months of age for Group 1 and Group 2&#xD;
