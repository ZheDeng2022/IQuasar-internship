  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety of etripamil nasal spray (NS)&#xD;
      70 mg when self-administered by patients with an episode of Paroxysmal Supraventricular&#xD;
      Tachycardia in an outpatient setting (i.e., without medical supervision).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The NODE-302 study is an extension of the NODE-301 efficacy study. It is a multi-centre, open&#xD;
      label study designed to evaluate the safety of etripamil NS 70 mg when self-administered by&#xD;
      patients for spontaneous episodes of PSVT in an outpatient setting. All patients randomized&#xD;
      in the NODE-301 study and who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the NODE-302 study&#xD;
      are eligible for the NODE-302 study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After each episode of PSVT, patients will have the option to continue in the NODE-302 study&#xD;
      and manage subsequent episodes of PSVT with etripamil NS 70 mg if they do not meet any&#xD;
      withdrawal criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each episode of PSVT will be documented by an ambulatory cardiac monitoring system (CMS) that&#xD;
      will be placed on the chest by the patient or caregiver when symptoms begin, and will record&#xD;
      at least 5 hours of continuous ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include a Qualification Visit, a Treatment Period(s) , a Follow-up Visit(s) ,a&#xD;
      Final Study Visit and if necessary an Early Termination Visit if the patient withdraws from&#xD;
      the study after taking etripamil NS 70 mg and had a Follow-up Visit, or the patient withdraws&#xD;
      from the study and did not take etripamil NS 70 mg.&#xD;
