  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to assess the impact of the school lunch program and&#xD;
      nutrition education towards the change in knowledge, attitude, and behavior on balanced&#xD;
      nutrition and clean and healthy lifestyle behavior (CHLB) of adolescents living in an Islamic&#xD;
      Boarding School. The secondary objective is to assess the program impact on energy and&#xD;
      nutrient intake, nutrition status, hemoglobin concentration, physical fitness and&#xD;
      concentrating ability of students.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pre-post quasi experimental design is applied to assess the impact. The intervention&#xD;
      includes: 1) provision of nutritious lunch, meeting the nutrient requirements of adolescents&#xD;
      for one meal, for 7 days a week, with the total duration of 220 days, 2) provision of&#xD;
      nutrition education once a week (3 times delivered by teachers, 1 time delivered by research&#xD;
      team) and nutrition education media, 3) capacity building of teachers and food handlers. The&#xD;
      duration of the intervention is 1 academic year or 8 active months after the reduction of&#xD;
      holidays and examination months.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This research will be conducted using pre-post quasi experimental design. Subjects consist of&#xD;
      only intervention group, who are measured before and after the intervention or program&#xD;
      period. The SLP program (intervention) in Darussalam Islamic Boarding School consists of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Balanced Nutrition Education and CHLB for the boarding school students and teachers&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Provision of lunch&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Food processing training, food sanitation hygiene and food safety for food handlers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The location of this activity is determined purposively at the Islamic boarding school, in&#xD;
      the neighborhood of the IPB (Institut Pertanian Bogor) campus with the following basic&#xD;
      criteria for the school:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Has apparent nutritional problems among the students&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. It has a kitchen and dining area for its students in need of improvement&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Has a strong commitment to cooperate in running the program. This activity will be held&#xD;
           at the Darussalam Islamic Boarding School located in Laladon Bogor area. There are 450&#xD;
           students consisting of both male and female students. This Islamic boarding school has a&#xD;
           kitchen that is used to process and cook food for the students. The eating area is&#xD;
           divided into two areas, in the form of a shared dining room for the male students and a&#xD;
           terrace for the female students. The Islamic boarding school also has a garden area that&#xD;
           is used for gardening activities for the students but it has not been managed in a&#xD;
           sustainable manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall project period is 18 months (2017/09-2019/03), which includes design, baseline,&#xD;
      midline and endline data collection (3 times), implementation and reporting activities. The&#xD;
      implementation of the school lunch program will be for 1 academic year (8 active months after&#xD;
      the reduction of holidays and examination months), starting immediately after Institutional&#xD;
      Review Board (IRB) approval of both Bogor University and Ajinomoto co. inc.until the end of&#xD;
      March 2019. Lunch will be served 7 days per week with the total of 220 days The provision of&#xD;
      lunch is designed to meet 30% of the daily nutritional requirements of students and contains&#xD;
      635-776 Kcal of energy with 18-22 grams of protein. The lunch menu is served in the form of a&#xD;
      full menu consisting of staple food, animal products, plant products, vegetables and fruit by&#xD;
      utilizing local food. The menu cycle used is a set menu cycle of 10+1 day cycle Hemoglobin&#xD;
      level and dietary intake data was collected for sub sample of students, meeting the sample&#xD;
      size calculation, which was 150 subjects. Data will be collected at baseline (before the&#xD;
      intervention), midline, and endline.&#xD;
