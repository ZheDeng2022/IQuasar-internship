      Dexamethasone in patients with RRMM and impaired renal function. Received 2 - 4 prior lines&#xD;
      of therapy and a renal function (creatinine clearance by Cockcroft-Gault formula) between ≥30&#xD;
      mL/min to &lt;45 mL/min in Cohort 1,and ≥15 mL/min to &lt;30 mL/min in Cohort 2.&#xD;
