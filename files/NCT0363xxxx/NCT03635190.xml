      To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Cardio Flow FreedomFlow™ Orbital&#xD;
      Circumferential Atherectomy System for atherosclerotic plaque removal and vessel compliance&#xD;
      modification in de novo native target lesions in the peripheral vasculature of the lower&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The FAST II study is a prospective, multi-center, non-randomized single-arm trial designed to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the FreedomFlow™ Orbital Circumferential Atherectomy&#xD;
      System in subjects diagnosed with peripheral arterial disease of the lower extremities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FreedomFlow™ Orbital Circumferential Atherectomy System is a minimally invasive,&#xD;
      catheter-based system designed for improving luminal diameter and modifying vessel wall&#xD;
      compliance in patients with PAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FreedomFlow™ Orbital Circumferential Atherectomy System is indicated to remove&#xD;
      atherosclerotic plaque and modifying vessel wall compliance within peripheral arterial&#xD;
      vessels. The therapy is intended for patients who are acceptable candidates for percutaneous&#xD;
      transluminal atherectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the FreedomFlow™&#xD;
      Orbital Circumferential Atherectomy System for atherosclerotic plaque removal and vessel&#xD;
      modification in de novo target lesions in the peripheral vasculature of the lower&#xD;
      extremities.&#xD;
