  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn more about how to treat patients with a diagnosis of&#xD;
      diagnosis of Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2/neu (HER-2/neu) positive breast cancer&#xD;
      in the past, who were previously treated with HER-2/neu-directed dendritic cells (DC)&#xD;
      vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is evidence that the use of anti-HER2 dendritic cell (DC) study vaccines could improve&#xD;
      response to breast cancer therapy and be an important step in the prevention of recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will use a Dendritic Cell Type 1 (DC1) vaccine which is a HER2-sensitized&#xD;
      dendritic cell (DC) study vaccine. Dendritic cells are immune cells that can tell the&#xD;
      participant's immune system to fight infection. This study vaccine will be made from the&#xD;
      participant's blood cells collected from a procedure called leukapheresis.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a diagnosis of nonmetastatic or metastatic breast cancer in complete&#xD;
             clinicla response classic HER2pos (ie, IHC 3+ or FISHpos) breast cancer (BC) who have&#xD;
             previously been vaccinated with DC1 HER2-pulsed vaccines on any of several prior&#xD;
             clinical trials for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or inflammatory breast cancer&#xD;
             (IBC) are eligible; however, we also allowed HER2 2+ patients in many of these prior&#xD;
             trials and they will also be allowed to participate in this trial. Note: HER2pos BC is&#xD;
             defined by tumor tissue HER2 overexpression and or tumor HER2 amplification. The lack&#xD;
             of HER2 overexpression by IHC is defined as 0 or 1+ whereas overexpression is defined&#xD;
             as 3+. In the event of equivocal IHC, 2+, the tumor must be gene-amplified by&#xD;
             fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) performed upon the primary tumor or&#xD;
             metastatic lesion (ratio &gt; 2 and HER2 copy number &gt; 4 define HER2negdisease).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with nonmetastatic HER posBC must have completed all standard-of-care&#xD;

             antiestrogen therapy is permitted while on trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with diagnosis of metastatic HER2 pos breast cancer must have complete tumor&#xD;
             response to current treatment per RECIST 1.1 and completed all standard-of-care&#xD;
             chemotherapy. Note: maintenance treatment with approved HER2-targeted agents and/or&#xD;
             antiestrogen therapy is permitted while on trial.&#xD;

             states, unless disease has been treated and confirmed cleared.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major surgery within 4 weeks of initiation of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have not recovered to ≤ Grade 1 or tolerable Grade 2 adverse events (AEs) due to&#xD;
             agents administered ≥ 28 days earlier, as documented by the treating investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently enrolled in any other clinical protocol or investigational trial that&#xD;
             involves administration of experimental therapy and/or therapeutic devices, or&#xD;
             investigational drug. Note: patients enrolled on another HER2 vaccine trial but not&#xD;
             receiving active therapy can enroll in this study.&#xD;
