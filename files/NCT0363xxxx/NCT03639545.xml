  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Introduction: Diabetes mellitus is characterized by impaired arterial function and high&#xD;
      incidence of cardiovascular events. Metformin and most recent antidiabetic groups of drugs,&#xD;
      SGLT2 inhibitors, were in previous studies shown to reduce cardiovascular events. Until now,&#xD;
      direct effect of empagliflozin on arterial function and its comparison to metformin was not&#xD;
      studied yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: The aim of the present study is to explore and compare potential direct effects of&#xD;
      empagliflozin and metformin on arterial functional and structural arterial wall&#xD;
      characteristics in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus are randomized into four groups: 1)&#xD;
      empagliflozin (25 mg daily), 2) metformin (2000 mg daily), 3) combination (empagliflozin 25&#xD;
      mg daily and metformin 2000 mg daily) and 4) control (placebo). At inclusion and after 12&#xD;
      weeks treatment, arterial function is assessed: endothelial function (brachial artery&#xD;
      flow-mediated dilation (FMD), reactive hyperemia index (RHI)) and arterial stiffness (carotid&#xD;
      pulse wave velocity (PWV), carotid-femoral PWV (cfPWV) and common carotid artery stiffness&#xD;
      (β-stiffness)).&#xD;

&#xD;

      empagliflozin (25 mg daily), 2) metformin (2000 mg daily), 3) combination (empagliflozin 25&#xD;

      pulse wave velocity (PWV), carotid-femoral PWV (cfPWV) and common carotid artery stiffness&#xD;
      (β-stiffness)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetes mellitus is characterized by chronic hyperglycaemia causing chronic microvascular&#xD;
      and macrovascular complications. Among the microvascular complications, diabetic retinopathy,&#xD;
      neuropathy and nephropathy are included. Macrovascular complications include atherosclerotic&#xD;
      brain-vascular disease, coronary disease and peripheral arterial disease. Chronic&#xD;
      complications of diabetes pose a greater risk of disability, development of blindness, renal&#xD;
      failure, neuropathy and cardiovascular disease. Consequently, a good glycemic control is&#xD;
      crucial to protect the patients from the development of chronic complications. In this&#xD;
      regard, glycemic control is of primary importance, as well as the choice of treatment that&#xD;
      can further improve the functioning of the arteries and thus protect against the onset of&#xD;
      cardiovascular damage or complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the treatment of hyperglycemia patients with type 1 diabetes need insulin. Some oral&#xD;
      anti-diabetics have been found to improve glycemic control, reduce insulin consumption (the&#xD;
      total daily insulin dose), and also protect against the development of cardiovascular&#xD;
      complications. Such effects have been shown in clinical studies for metformin. The latter&#xD;
      improved from endothelium-dependent relaxation of the arteries and reduced insulin&#xD;
      resistance, but most studies were performed in patients with type 2 diabetes and studies in&#xD;
      type 1 diabetes are limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A novel group of oral antidiabetics are SGLT2 inhibitors, such as empagliflozin, reduce&#xD;
      glucose reabsorption in proximal kidney tubules and increase glucose excretion through urine.&#xD;
      Most of the previous studies on the efficacy of empagliflozin basic antidiabetic activity and&#xD;
      additional effects have been performed in patients with type 2 diabetes. They were shown to&#xD;
      improve glyceamia control and also reduced blood pressure body weight. In patients with type&#xD;
      1 diabetes, favorable effects of empagliflozin on the reduction of arterial wall stiffness&#xD;
      and blood pressure reduction were observed, but no systematic studies were performed yet and&#xD;
      the mechanisms behind the beneficial effects are not known yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type 1 diabetes mellitus patients are being recruited. The patients are equally randomized&#xD;
      into 4 groups that receive one of the three drugs in addition to insulin. The groups were as&#xD;
      follows: 1) empagliflozin group (receiving 25 mg daily), 2) metformin group (receiving 2000&#xD;
      mg daily), combination group (receiving empagliflozin 25 mg daily and metformin 2000 mg&#xD;
      daily) and 4) control group (receiving placebo). The duration of the study period is 12&#xD;
      weeks. All subjects are voluntarily participating in this study. The study was approved by&#xD;
      the National Medical Ethics Committee of Slovenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the beginning of the study, a complete history and full medical examination of each&#xD;
      patient are performed. At inclusion to the study and after 12 weeks of treatment, arterial&#xD;
      function measurements are performed, comprising of i) measurements of endothelial function&#xD;
      (brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD), reactive hyperemia index (RHI)); and ii)&#xD;
      measurements of arterial stiffness (carotid artery pulse wave velocity (PWV), carotid-femoral&#xD;
      PWV (cfPWV) and common carotid artery stiffness (β-stiffness)). Additionally, venous blood&#xD;
      samples are obtained at the beginning and at the end of the study period. Automated&#xD;
      sphygmomanometer is used for blood pressure measurements. Ultrasound measurements are&#xD;
      obtained on Aloka ProSound alpha7 machine with integrated high resolution eTracking system.&#xD;
      Endothelial function, by means of brachial artery FMD, was assessed in accordance to the&#xD;
      current guidelines. Reactive hyperemia index is measured using Endopat 2000 device (Itamar&#xD;
      Medical Ltd., Caesarea, Israel), while cfPWV is obtained using SphygmoCor device (AtCor&#xD;
      Medical, Sydney, Australia) with SphygmoCor CvMS software (version 9).&#xD;
