  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine if a short audio clip about mindfulness implemented during NST&#xD;
      appointments can lower pregnant women's levels of anxiety and depression. Subjects will be&#xD;
      placed into either the intervention group or a control group. The intervention group will be&#xD;
      asked to listen to a short audio clip on mindfulness during their NST appointments, and the&#xD;
      control group will receive the standard of care during NST appointments. Subjects will be&#xD;
      asked to take two surveys about anxiety and depression three times throughout the study:&#xD;
      before the intervention, after the intervention, and 6 weeks postpartum.&#xD;

    <measure>Beck Anxiety Inventory Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Over the course of 6 intervention sessions, followed by 6 weeks postpartum</time_frame>
    <description>We are looking for the members of our intervention group to see a change in their scores on the Beck Anxiety Inventory after completing 6 sessions of listening to a mindfulness clip. We expect to see this score change after the full-course of the intervention is complete. We also hope to see this change in score persist at the 6-week postpartum visit. This scale aims to measure anxiety symptoms, and total scores range from 0-36. Lower scores indicate lower levels of anxiety symptoms, and thus a better outcome.</description>

We expect to see this score change after the intervention is complete. We also hope to see this change in score persist at the 6-week postpartum visit. This scale aims to measure depressive symptoms, and total scores range from 0-30. Lower scores indicate lower levels of depressive symptoms, and thus a better outcome.</description>
