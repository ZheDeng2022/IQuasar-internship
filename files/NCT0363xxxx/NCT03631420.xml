          4. Have C-reactive protein (CRP) &gt;30 mg/L; or any infections including pneumonia, sepsis,&#xD;
             or shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Have pre-existing severe intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) (grade ≥3).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Have active pulmonary hemorrhage or air leak syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Have abnormal hepatic (AST, ALT &gt;150 U/L or direct bilirubin &gt;2 mg/dL or total&#xD;
             bilirubin &gt;15 mg/dL) or renal function (serum creatinine &gt;1 mg/dL or oliguria).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Are known to be infected with HIV or CMV.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Are expected to have surgery within 24 hours prior to and/or after UMC119 01&#xD;
             instillation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Are expected to receive any other intratracheal treatments, including surfactant&#xD;
             within 72 hours prior to and/or after UMC119 01 instillation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Are currently participating in any other interventional clinical trial.&#xD;
