      Except for children with HIV, all recommendations for treatment of childhood malnutrition are&#xD;
      for children &lt; 5 years of age. The overall goal of this randomized controlled nutritional&#xD;
      feasibility trial is to identify whether families of children with sickle cell anemia (SCA) &gt;&#xD;
      5 years of age agree to participate over a 12-week period. The investigators will also&#xD;
      establish a safety protocol for monitoring potential complications associated with treating&#xD;
      severe malnutrition in children &gt; 5 years of age with and without SCA, in a low-resource&#xD;
      setting.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this feasibility trial is to determine the acceptability of a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial to ascertain the optimal strategy for the treatment of severe malnutrition&#xD;
      in children with sickle cell disease (SCD) older than 5 years of age. No international&#xD;
      standard or evidence-based guidelines exist for the treatment of severe malnutrition (defined&#xD;
      as BMI Z-score below -3) in children with SCD. With an expanding pediatric population of more&#xD;
      than 75 million in Nigeria, coupled with decreasing childhood infectious disease-related&#xD;
      mortality, the next emerging threats to preventable childhood deaths are non-communicable&#xD;
      diseases. Data from our ongoing NIH-funded randomized controlled primary stroke prevention&#xD;
      trial in Nigeria (NCT02560935), in which the investigators evaluated children with SCD&#xD;
      between 5 and 12 years of age, demonstrated that 29% (230/803) of the cohort met criteria for&#xD;
      severe malnutrition. Approximately 92% of the cohort in northern Nigeria identified as having&#xD;
      severe malnutrition was below the 5th percentile for weight of children with SCD living in&#xD;
      the US, Canada, or Europe. These data indicate older children with SCD living in northern&#xD;
      Nigeria are undernourished when compared to children living with SCD in high-resource&#xD;
      settings. A potentially unique attribute to treating malnutrition in children with SCD is the&#xD;
      use of FDA approved anti-metabolite, hydroxyurea, to prevent vaso-occlusive pain events in&#xD;
      children. The beneficial effects of hydroxyurea include, but are not limited to, decreased&#xD;
      inflammation and increased hemoglobin levels. Preliminary evidence in this cohort of older&#xD;
      children with sickle cell anemia (SCA) in northern Nigeria reveals that moderate fixed-dose&#xD;
      hydroxyurea (20 mg/kg/day) significantly increases BMI in children with severe malnutrition.&#xD;
      The investigators propose a randomized controlled feasibility trial in older children (5 to&#xD;
      12 years of age) with SCA living in northern Nigeria. In preparation for a definitive phase&#xD;
      III trial to determine if a nutritional supplement (SoyaPlus) and moderate fixed-dose&#xD;
      hydroxyurea therapy is superior to a nutritional supplement alone, the investigators will&#xD;
      randomly allocate 100 children between 5 and 12 years of age with SCA and severe&#xD;
      uncomplicated malnutrition to each of the two arms. In aim 1, the investigators will assess&#xD;
      the feasibility (rate of recruitment, retention, and adherence) of a randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial (RCT) in children with SCA and severe malnutrition to a 12-week intervention period.&#xD;
      For aim 2, the investigators will establish the safety protocol to monitor for unknown rates&#xD;
      of complications associated with treating malnutrition in children with SCD. To decrease the&#xD;
      likelihood of sharing limited food resources in a poor family and to determine the&#xD;
      specificity of malnutrition for children with SCD in northern Nigeria, the investigators will&#xD;
      screen and treat up to 100 malnourished non-SCD siblings of the trial participants. After&#xD;
      completion of this feasibility trial, the investigators will use the acquired knowledge to&#xD;
      design a phase III trial to definitively determine the optimal treatment strategy for severe&#xD;
      malnutrition in older children with SCD living in Africa, potentially affecting thousands of&#xD;
      children in this region.&#xD;

Study investigators expect the proportion of serious adverse reactions, as well as refeeding-related morbidity and mortality, to be very small compared to the benefits.
