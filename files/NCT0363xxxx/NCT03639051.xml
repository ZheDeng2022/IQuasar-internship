    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to confirm the safety and efficacy of the Nuvaira Lung&#xD;
      Denervation System (Nuvaira System) in the treatment of COPD.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the superiority of treatment with the&#xD;
      Nuvaira Lung Denervation System (Active Treatment arm) compared to a sham procedure (Sham&#xD;
      Control arm) to decrease moderate or severe exacerbations in subjects with COPD on optimal&#xD;
      medical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to compare long-term safety, and other efficacy assessments&#xD;
      between the Active Treatment arm and the Sham Control arm.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire COPD Version (SGRQ-C) Total score</measure>

    <description>Defined as a comparison between study arms of the mean change in FVC based on a linear model for change in SGRQ-C, adjusted for baseline SGRQ-C.&#xD;
The SGRQ-C is a disease-specific HRQL questionnaire with a total and three component scores for: symptoms, activity and impacts; each score ranges from 0 (no impairment) to 100 (worst possible). A difference in four units in the SGRQ-C score is considered the minimum clinically important difference (MCID).</description>

    <description>Defined as a comparison between study arms of the mean change in SF-36 total score based on a linear model for change in SF-36 total score, adjusted for baseline SF-36 total score.&#xD;
SF-36 is composed of eight multi-item scales (Physical Functioning, Role-Physical, Bodily Pain, General Health, Vitality, Social Functioning, Role-Emotional, Mental Health), with scores for each of these scales (or dimensions) ranging from 0 to 100. Higher scores indicate higher HRQoL.</description>

The CAT is a disease-specific HRQL with eight questions; each score ranges from 0 (no impairment) to 5 (worst possible). The CAT has a scoring range of 0-40. Higher scores denote a more severe impact of COPD on a patient's life. A difference in 2 units in the CAT score over 2 to 3 months suggests a clinically significant difference or change in health status.</description>
