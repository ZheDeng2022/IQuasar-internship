    <textblock>
      Patients with suspected or known coronary artery disease who are scheduled for clinically&#xD;
      indicated SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) and likely will further receive invasive&#xD;
      coronary angiogram will be recruited for a SPECT MBF study. The MBF study will be performed&#xD;
      as an adjunct to MPI utilizing the same rest and stress injections of 99mTc-Sestamibi (MIBI)&#xD;
      tracer, and the same infusion of dipyridamole, adenosine or adenosine triphosphate for&#xD;
      stressing. The MBF study will be completed in single or two days depending on the imaging&#xD;
      protocol of MPI for a site. This is an observational study with no interventions to the&#xD;
      clinical routine whatsoever. Three models of SPECT (GE NM530c) and SPECT/CT (Siemens&#xD;
      Symbia-T16 and -T2) cameras are included to acquire rest/stress dynamic SPECT and MPI data. A&#xD;
      CT scan will be acquired for the purpose of attenuation correction. All dynamic images will&#xD;
      be reconstructed with physical corrections, including attenuation, scatter, resolution&#xD;
      recovery and noise reduction, and processed to quantify MBF with the same kinetic modeling.&#xD;
      The imaging processing of MBF study will be conducted with a SPECT MBF dedicated software&#xD;
      (MyoFlowQ) in a central lab. MPI images will be collected and independently read by three&#xD;
      consensus readers. The angiographic result will be independently reviewed by an&#xD;
      interventional cardiologist. Diagnostic performance of SPECT MBF and perfusion will be&#xD;
      compared utilizing angiographic result as the reference standard.&#xD;
