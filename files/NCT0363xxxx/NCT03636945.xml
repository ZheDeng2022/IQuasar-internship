  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) develops at the expense of calcitonin cells and is often&#xD;
      characterized by lymph node metastases and sometimes visceral metastases. Improvement of&#xD;
      preoperative diagnosis is of major importance in CMT because the quality of the initial&#xD;
      surgery determines the prognosis. In recent years, 18F-fluorodihydroxyphenylalanine&#xD;
      (18F-FDOPA) PET / CT was considered the most sensitive functional imaging tool in the&#xD;
      evaluation of persistent CMT. To date, 18F-FDOPA PET at initial diagnosis has been reported&#xD;
      in a few clinical cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to demonstrate that 18F-FDOPA PET provides additional information&#xD;
      compared to conventional imaging on the initial diagnosis of CMT patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to describe the nature of the information provided by PET / CT&#xD;
      imaging, the main factors influencing tracer uptake and the positivity of PET / CT, and the&#xD;
      impact of the examination on the care of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, multicenter and open study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with TCM who have serum calcitonin&gt; 150 pg / ml at initial diagnosis and have&#xD;
      performed baseline imaging examinations within the last 3 months will be included in the&#xD;
      study . A PET at 18F-FDOPA will be performed according to a very powerful acquisition&#xD;
      protocol. Image analysis will be performed blindly from the results of conventional imaging.&#xD;
      All exams will be compared, in accordance with the gold standard. Therapeutic intentions will&#xD;
      be collected before and after the PET imaging, as well as the actual management in place.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) develops at the expense of calcitonin cells and is often&#xD;
      characterized by lymph node metastases (&gt; 50% of cases) and sometimes visceral metastases (&gt;&#xD;
      5%). Improvement of preoperative diagnosis is of major importance in CMT because the quality&#xD;
      of the initial surgery determines the prognosis. In recent years,&#xD;
      18F-fluorodihydroxyphenylalanine (18F-FDOPA) PET / CT was considered the most sensitive&#xD;
      functional imaging tool in the evaluation of persistent CMT. To date, 18F-FDOPA PET at&#xD;
      initial diagnosis has been reported in a few clinical cases. Preliminary study, which&#xD;
      included 9 CMT patients, 18F-FDOPA PET showed very promising results during the initial&#xD;
      diagnosis, particularly in node staging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to demonstrate that 18F-FDOPA PET provides additional information&#xD;
      compared to conventional imaging on the initial diagnosis of CMT patients. The secondary&#xD;
      objectives are to describe the nature of the information provided by PET / CT imaging, the&#xD;
      main factors influencing tracer uptake and the positivity of PET / CT, and the impact of the&#xD;
      examination on the care of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, multicenter and open study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with TCM who have serum calcitonin&gt; 150 pg / ml at initial diagnosis and have&#xD;
      performed baseline imaging examinations (as recommended by the 2015 ATA) within the last 3&#xD;
      months will be included in the study . A PET at 18F-FDOPA will be performed according to a&#xD;
      very powerful acquisition protocol. Image analysis will be performed blindly from the results&#xD;
      of conventional imaging. All exams will be compared, in accordance with the gold standard.&#xD;
      Therapeutic intentions will be collected before and after the PET imaging, as well as the&#xD;
      actual management in place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of patients expected: 62. Duration of the study: 29 months of inclusion and 7 months&#xD;
      of follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 60 to 70 patients with a CMT are operated annually in the centers involved. Nuclear&#xD;
      physicians, endocrine surgeons, endocrinologists and anatomopathologists work together in&#xD;
      institutional and interinstitutional team meetings (SFE-RENATEN). Some of the centers have&#xD;
      already collaborated on the implementation of a large PHRC-INCa project recently published in&#xD;
      the JCEM.&#xD;
