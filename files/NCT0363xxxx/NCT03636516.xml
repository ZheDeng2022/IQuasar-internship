  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Many studies showed that stone-free rates (SFRs) after extracorporeal shock wave&#xD;
      lithotripsy (SWL) might be related to both the patient (body mass index; BMI, skin-to-stone&#xD;
      distance; SSD), and stone related factors (location, stone size, and stone density). However,&#xD;
      the possible effect of pre-stenting on success as well as complication rates after SWL has&#xD;
      not been evaluated in detail to date. Taking this fact into account, the effect of&#xD;
      pre-stenting on the outcomes of SWL treatment in renal stones must be evaluated in the&#xD;
      absence of possible effects induced by the patient and stone-related factors. Aim: To&#xD;
      evaluate the effect of double J (JJ) stents on SWL treatment of moderate sized (15-25-mm)&#xD;
      renal pelvic stones. Study design: Randomized prospective study Methods: Between January 2016&#xD;
      and December 2017, a total of 152 adult patients who were planned to undergo SWL for a single&#xD;
      radiopaque renal pelvic stone were included in the study. Patients with solitary kidney,&#xD;
      congenital abnormality, skeletal tract abnormalities, previous urinary system surgery,&#xD;
      hydronephrosis (grade 2 or more), untreated urinary tract infection, bleeding disorder, and&#xD;
      suspected pregnancy were excluded. The remaining 114 patients were randomly divided into two&#xD;
      groups; nonstented and stented. Twenty-two patients whose stone could not be fragmented&#xD;
      despite 3 consecutive sessions were also excluded from the study. A total of 92 patients (54&#xD;
      non-stented and 38 stented) were included in the final analysis.&#xD;

      Study design Between January 2016 and December 2017, a total of 152 adult (age &gt; 18 years)&#xD;
      patients who were planned to undergo extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) for a single&#xD;
      radiopaque renal pelvic stone with a largest diameter of 15 to 25 mm were included in the&#xD;
      study. Patients with solitary kidneys, congenital abnormalities, skeletal system&#xD;
      abnormalities, previous urinary system surgery, hydronephrosis (grade 2 or more), untreated&#xD;
      urinary tract infection, bleeding disorder, and suspected pregnancy were excluded from the&#xD;
      study. The remaining 114 patients were randomly divided into two groups as non-stented (n=67)&#xD;
      and stented (n=47). Randomization was performed by flipping a coin. During SWL procedures, 22&#xD;
      patients whose stone could not be fragmented despite 3 consecutive sessions were also&#xD;
      excluded from the study. A total of 92 patients (54 non-stented and 38 stented) were included&#xD;
      in the final analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preprocedural evaluation All patients were evaluated preoperatively using non-contrast&#xD;
      computed tomography (CT). Prior to treatment, a complete urine test, if needed urine culture&#xD;
      and antibiogram test, simple serum biochemistry and coagulation tests were performed in all&#xD;
      patients. The impact of patient-related factors (age, sex, body mass index;BMI),&#xD;
      stone-related factors (laterality, stone size and Hounsfield units; HU), renal parenchymal&#xD;
      thickness (RPT), and skin-to-stone distance (SSD) on fragmentation were analyzed. Body mass&#xD;
      index (BMI) was calculated by dividing the weight (kg) by the square of the height (m2). CT&#xD;
      with 5-mm contiguous sections at 120 kw and 90 milliampere (mA) was performed in all patients&#xD;
      using a multidetector row helical CT scanner (Somatom Plus; Siemens, Germany). The&#xD;
      longitudinal stone dimension was calculated by multiplying collimation thickness and the&#xD;
      number of images in which the stone seen. The transverse dimension was chosen as the diameter&#xD;
      of stone from the image showing its largest width. The maximum dimension of the stone was&#xD;
      accepted as the highest value measured, either the longitudinal or transverse diameter. The&#xD;
      average CT attenuation value as the representative HU was measured by drawing a region of&#xD;
      interest smaller than the stone in the image showing the stone in the largest dimension. The&#xD;
      SSD was calculated by measuring the distance from the skin to the stone at posterolateral&#xD;
      45°. All patients signed an informed consent form for SWL and pre-stenting. Stent size was&#xD;
      4.8 French and 26 cm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SWL technique SWL was performed with an electromagnetic lithotripter Compact Sigma (Dornier&#xD;
      Med Tech System Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung; GmbH, Weßling, Germany) by the same&#xD;
      operator, with the patient in the supine position, and with a standardized treatment angle&#xD;
      under both fluoroscopic and ultrasonic guidance. SWL procedures were performed with analgesic&#xD;
      application (75 mg diclofenac sodium). If needed, a compression bag was used to decrease&#xD;
      stone movement caused by respiration. Each session was completed either after application of&#xD;
      a total of 3000 shock waves or when the stone was completely disintegrated. The degree of&#xD;
      shock wave power delivered during SWL was recorded as 1 to 6 and the shock wave frequency was&#xD;
      90/minute. Individual power settings were adjusted according to the patient's tolerance.&#xD;
      Patients were evaluated 1 week after each session through abdominal kidneys, ureters, and&#xD;
      urinary bladder (KUB) X-ray and repeat treatment was performed in cases of inadequate&#xD;
      disintegration. Management was stopped when there was no disintegration despite 3 SWL&#xD;
      sessions. No patients received medical expulsive treatment (MET) before or after SWL&#xD;
      sessions. JJ stents were removed after 4 weeks. In view of the radiographic assessment with&#xD;
      CT performed 4 months following the last SWL session, treatment results were categorized as&#xD;
      either successful or unsuccessful according to whether there were any residual stone&#xD;
      fragments. During SWL sessions and after treatment, the number of emergency department visits&#xD;
      and analgesic consumption were recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences&#xD;
      software version 19 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA). Descriptive statistics were&#xD;
      determined for the mean, standard deviation, lowest and highest, and ratio values. The&#xD;
      distribution of the variables was measured using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Univariate&#xD;
      (Chi-square or t-test) tests were performed to determine whether there was a statistically&#xD;
      significant difference for characteristics between the stented and non-stented groups. If&#xD;
      parameters did not show normal dispersion, the Mann-Whitney U test, which is the&#xD;
      nonparametric equivalent of the t-test, was performed. The threshold for statistical&#xD;
      significance was accepted as p &lt; 0.05 for all analyses.&#xD;
