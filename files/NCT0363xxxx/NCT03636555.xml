  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To further test the effectiveness of oxytocin in heavy drinkers, half of the cohort in the&#xD;
      proposed study will meet criteria for heavy drinking (&gt;35 standard drinks/week [men], &gt;28&#xD;
      standard drinks/week [women] for at least 4 consecutive weeks). However, the investigators&#xD;
      think it important to expand the cohort of the proposed study to include subjects with&#xD;
      moderate Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) who meet lower drinking criteria so the outcome of the&#xD;
      study will be relevant to a larger percentage of individuals who have AUD. The lower drinking&#xD;
      criteria will be minimum of 14 drinks/week (women) or 21 drinks/week (men) with an average of&#xD;
      at least two heavy drinking days (≥5 standard drinks for men and ≥4 standard drinks for&#xD;
      women) each week in the 4-week period prior to screening. As in the R21-funded Preliminary&#xD;
      Study, individuals recruited from the community who meet study criteria based on assessment&#xD;
      during a screening clinic visit will be randomized to twice a day (BID) intranasal oxytocin&#xD;
      or intranasal placebo during a subsequent clinic visit. After instruction by research staff&#xD;
      during the randomization clinic visit, subjects will self-administer intranasal treatments&#xD;
      from blind-labeled spray bottles that they take home. During clinic visits at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6,&#xD;
      8, 10, and 12 weeks after randomization, drinking since the last visit will be quantified and&#xD;
      other measures summarized above will be obtained. Subjects will self-administer test&#xD;
      intranasal treatments for 12 weeks. Drinking will also be quantified during clinic visits at&#xD;
      6 and 12 weeks after cessation of intranasal treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical trial will be the first adequately powered, double blind, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      trial examining the efficacy and tolerability of BID intranasal oxytocin (40 IU/dose; 80&#xD;
      IU/d) on alcohol drinking in AUD. The trial will also be the first to prospectively examine&#xD;
      the effects of intranasal oxytocin on anxiety symptoms in individuals with AUD.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Design: This will be a randomized, double blind, 12-week clinical trial comparing the&#xD;
      efficacy of intranasal self-administration of oxytocin (Syntocinon Spray [intranasal oxytocin&#xD;
      spray], Novartis) vs. intranasal placebo (containing the same ingredients as Syntocinon Spray&#xD;
      except for oxytocin) to in individuals with moderate Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of&#xD;
      Mental Disorders-V (DSM-V) AUD and individuals with severe AUD who, in both groups, meet&#xD;
      specific drinking criteria. Treatment assignments will be counterbalance within gender and&#xD;
      within the moderate and severe AUD groups. The primary outcomes are measures of drinking:&#xD;
      percentage of heavy drinking days (&gt;5 [men], &gt;4 [women] standard drinks), percentage of&#xD;
      abstinent days, and mean standard drinks per drinking day based on Timeline Followback&#xD;
      interview data collected at each clinic visit after randomization (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, and&#xD;
      12 weeks during the intranasal test treatment period; 6 and 12 weeks after cessation of test&#xD;
      treatments). Secondary outcomes are subject self-ratings of craving for alcohol and anxiety&#xD;
      on standardized questionnaires. Baseline measures of drinking, craving and anxiety will be&#xD;
      covariates in statistical comparisons between the treatment groups of outcomes over the&#xD;
      course of the treatment trial and the follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures Recruitment: Potential participants will be recruited from the Raleigh, Durham,&#xD;
      and Chapel Hill, North Carolina areas by screening subjects who respond to community&#xD;
      advertising. Respondents to advertisements will have a preliminary telephone screening&#xD;
      conducted by the study coordinator. Individuals who appear eligible, as determined by the&#xD;
      investigative team, will be scheduled for more comprehensive in-person screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Clinic Visit: Prospective subjects who appear to meet study criteria based on phone&#xD;
      interviews will come to the Psychiatry outpatient clinic at a scheduled time for in-person&#xD;
      screening procedures to ascertain whether they truly meet study criteria (see Eligibility&#xD;
      Criteria below). Initially individuals will read and sign the informed consent and be given a&#xD;
      copy for their records. A breathalyzer test using an Alco-Sensor III breathalyzer machine&#xD;
      (Intoximeters, Inc., St. Louis, MO) will be administered [breath alcohol concentration (BrAC)&#xD;
      must be 0.00 gms/dL to give informed consent]. Medical personnel will administer the Clinical&#xD;
      Institute Withdrawal Assessment of Alcohol (CIWA) Scale to determine if subjects are&#xD;
      exhibiting significant alcohol withdrawal. The CIWA score must be &lt;6 for subjects to give&#xD;
      informed consent. If the score is &gt;6, the visit will be rescheduled. In addition, blood&#xD;
      pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR), height and weight will be measured and BMI calculated.&#xD;
      Medical personnel will conduct a medical history and examination including a neurological&#xD;
      examination. Over-the-counter and prescription medication use will be recorded. The&#xD;
      Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence will be administered to smokers. Laboratory&#xD;
      evaluations will include complete blood count (CBC) with differential; chemistries including&#xD;
      bilirubin, Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), Gamma-glutamyl&#xD;
      transferase (GGT), sodium, potassium, chloride, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and glucose;&#xD;
      and urinalysis as well as urine toxicology (drug screen). A carbohydrate deficient&#xD;
      transferrin (CDT) sample will be drawn. CDT samples will be stored frozen and then shipped in&#xD;
      batches of 40 to Dr. Ray Anton's lab in Charleston, South Carolina for assay. CDT&#xD;
      demonstrates excellent specificity to detect heavy alcohol use over time and has been shown&#xD;
      to complement self-report measures of consumption. With subjects' permission, a sample of&#xD;
      blood will also be obtained to archive for possible future genetic analyses. Women will be&#xD;
      given a serum pregnancy test (β-HCG) at screening and a urine pregnancy test at wks 4, 8, and&#xD;
      12. Trained interviewers will conduct the psychiatric/substance disorder-screening interview&#xD;
      using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview. The Structured Clinical Interview&#xD;
      for DSM-V Substance Use Disorders Module for AUD will be completed by a study physician to&#xD;
      determine criteria for moderate or severe AUD. The study coordinator will conduct the&#xD;
      pretreatment 90-day Timeline Followback interview (TLFB, Sobell et al, 1988) and potential&#xD;
      participants will complete the entire Spielberger State Trait Anxiety Inventory (SSTAI), the&#xD;
      Drinker's Inventory of Consequences, the Family History of Alcoholism Module (FHAM) to assess&#xD;
      family history of alcohol problems, the University of Rhode Island Change Assessment Scale to&#xD;
      assess motivation level, the Penn Alcohol Craving Scale to assess baseline craving, and the&#xD;
      Insomnia Severity Index to assess baseline sleep problems. Additionally, potential&#xD;
      participants will fill out a short evaluation of their treatment goals. This visit should&#xD;
      take about 3 h.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Clinic Visit: Individuals meeting inclusion but not exclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      informed and scheduled for the initial treatment visit within 10 days. Eligible individuals&#xD;
      will not be required to abstain from drinking alcohol prior to randomization. The study&#xD;
      coordinator will administer a breathalyzer test (BrAC must be ≤0.04 gm/dL; if &gt;0.04 gm/dL,&#xD;
      the visit will be rescheduled), measure BP and HR, conduct the TLFB interview, and ask&#xD;
      participants to complete the PACS, the state portion of the SSTAI (SSAI), and the Fagerstrom&#xD;
      Test. After BrAC reading, but before the other procedures, the study physician will evaluate&#xD;
      withdrawal symptoms using the CIWA and note the use of medications. If the CIWA score is &gt;6,&#xD;
      the visit will be rescheduled. A 60 mL bottle containing 50 mL of test substance (oxytocin or&#xD;
      placebo solution) with an intranasal spray mechanism that ejects 0.1 mL of aerosolized&#xD;
      solution per insufflation as well as written instructions will be dispensed from the UNC&#xD;
      Hospitals Investigational Drug Service according to the randomization schedule provide by Dr.&#xD;
      Robert Gallop, Biostatistical Consultant on the project. The bottle will contain sufficient&#xD;
      solution for the subject to self-administer intranasal test substance for at least 18 days so&#xD;
      he/she will not run out if there is a delay in returning for the next clinic visit. Subjects&#xD;
      will receive instructions for self-administration of intranasal test substance from members&#xD;
      of the Study Team. Subjects will then self-administer their first dose of the intranasal&#xD;
      substance to which they have been randomized [ten insufflations delivering 40 IU of&#xD;
      Syntocinon (oxytocin) Spray in a total of 1.0 mL of solution, or the same volume of placebo&#xD;
      solution which contains all the ingredients in Syntocinon Spray except oxytocin]. Subjects&#xD;
      will pause 30 sec between insufflations and will alternate insufflations between nostrils.&#xD;
      Study Team members will observe subjects' self-administration of their first dose to&#xD;
      determine if their technique is correct and to correct any errors in technique. In our&#xD;
      experience, subjects rapidly learn the self-administration technique. Participants also will&#xD;
      be given a calendar style diary to record times of intranasal self-administration, drinking,&#xD;
      and any side effects and a Self-Administration Instruction Sheet along with a wallet card&#xD;
      informing providers that the subject may be taking oxytocin should the individual require&#xD;
      emergency medical treatment. Finally, participants will receive Medical Management (MM) from&#xD;
      a trained clinician (see details below). This visit should be completed in about 1.25-1.5&#xD;
      hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequent Clinic Visits: Subjects will self-administer intranasal test doses BID (before&#xD;
      breakfast and dinner) for 12 weeks. They will have outpatient clinic visits at weeks 1, 2, 3,&#xD;
      4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 after starting intranasal test treatments. The investigators will accept a&#xD;
      window of ± 3 days for weekly visits and ± 7 days for biweekly visits in cases where a&#xD;
      subject cannot come for the exact visit date. At each visit, the following will be obtained:&#xD;
      breathalyzer (BrAC) reading; CIWA score; TLFB interview; BP; HR; the state portion of the&#xD;
      SSTAI; and PACS. The DrInC will be completed again at week 12. BrAC readings must be &lt;0.04&#xD;
      and CIWA scores &lt;6 for assessments to be done at clinic visits (BrAC readings must be &lt;.08 to&#xD;
      allow subjects to drive themselves home from any clinic visit). New spray bottles will be&#xD;
      given every 2 weeks. The weight of bottles will be recorded when first issued and when&#xD;
      returned during subsequent clinic visits. Change in weight will be our primary measure of&#xD;
      compliance. Blood and urine samples will be obtained for CBC, electrolytes, Blood Urea&#xD;
      Nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, liver function tests, urinalysis, urine drug screen and pregnancy&#xD;
      tests at 4, 8, and 12 weeks. As during the randomization clinic visit, the psychosocial&#xD;
      treatment provided during each subsequent clinic visit will be Medical Management (MM). At&#xD;
      the 12-week clinic visit, subjects will be given information about a wide range of treatment&#xD;
      options as well as contact information and will be offered assistance in making appointments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-Treatment Follow-up: Subjects will return for follow-up clinic visits at 6 and 12 weeks&#xD;
      (2 weeks also for follow-up measures if lab values at the 12-week clinic visit during the&#xD;
      test treatment period are abnormal) after cessation of intranasal test treatments. Assessment&#xD;
      at each follow-up visit will be BrAC, TLFB, PACS, SSAI, and questions about subjects'&#xD;
      enrollment and attendance record in individual, group, and/or medication treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical Management Intervention: The psychosocial treatment for the proposed study will be&#xD;
      Medical Management (MM). Dr. Kampov will be primarily responsible for MM with Drs. Garbutt,&#xD;
      Jordan and Pedersen providing additional coverage. Dr. Kampov and Dr. Garbutt have been&#xD;
      trained and certified in MM by Dr. William Dundon of the University of Pennsylvania and along&#xD;
      with Drs. Pedersen and Jordan have received MM training from Ms. Gail Kempf of the University&#xD;
      of Pennsylvania. MM is designed as a means for physicians and other health care providers to&#xD;
      encourage individuals with an AUD to make progress towards their drinking goals of reduction&#xD;
      or abstinence and to encourage compliance with medication. Whereas the primary goal of MM is&#xD;
      to encourage abstinence, the goal of reduction is acceptable and the investigators have used&#xD;
      this &quot;harm reduction&quot; approach in our clinical trials to date. Many subjects have an initial&#xD;
      goal of reduction that, over the course of trial participation, MM changes to abstinence. MM&#xD;
      does not provide intense counseling methods for reducing drinking or dealing with relapse&#xD;
      triggers and is thought to be an advantage for medication trials as MM does not overpower a&#xD;
      possible medication effect. The average length of MM sessions is 10-15 minutes and an MM&#xD;
      checklist is used in each session that greatly enhances consistency. The investigators will&#xD;
      audio-record 10-20 MM sessions for review by MM providers to enhance fidelity.&#xD;
