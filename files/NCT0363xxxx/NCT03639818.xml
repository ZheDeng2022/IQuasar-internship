    <textblock>
      Despite sustained inhibition of viral replication in plasma undergoing treatment, nearly 30%&#xD;
      of HIV-infected patients have HIV-related cognitive impairment. To date, no therapeutic&#xD;
      strategy has demonstrated clinical efficacy. The initial hypothesis is to use the non-medical&#xD;
      techniques of cognitive remediation commonly practiced in the treatment of Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease to allow improvement or even regression of cognitive disorders in HIV-infected people&#xD;
      (PHAs) who are virologically tested on antiretroviral combination therapy (ART). Some recent&#xD;
      pilot studies using individual computer-based cognitive remediation strategies show improved&#xD;
      test performance. However, none have studied the impact of this strategy on PPHIV with&#xD;
      cognitive impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single-center pilot study evaluating the efficacy of an individual cognitive remediation&#xD;
      program for 6 months on the improvement of cognitive impairment in patients with stable&#xD;
      plasma HIV viral load that is undetectable under stable antiretroviral combination (cART)&#xD;
      cognitive disorders related to HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to demonstrate improvement through a 6-month individual cognitive&#xD;
      remediation program on cognitive impairment (1 standard deviation variations on 2 M6&#xD;
      neuropsychological tests) in controlled HIV-positive individuals under cART with cognitive&#xD;
      disorders related to HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: Monocentric, prospective, pilot study of 40 patients performed in an open period&#xD;
      of 25 months. The inclusion period is 13 months and the participation duration per patient is&#xD;
      12 months. After an inclusion visit, patients start 15 days of individual cognitive&#xD;
      remediation sessions. The cognitive remediation will be led by a psychologist specialized in&#xD;
      neuropsychology, trained and experienced in this method. Cognitive remediation will be&#xD;
      performed at a rate of 1 to 2 sessions per week. Each patient will be assessed initially (M0)&#xD;
      at 6 months (M6) and 12 months (M12: 6 months after stopping cognitive remediation) with a&#xD;
      battery of standardized neuropsychological (NP) tests performed by a neuropsychologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint: Improved cognitive impairment after 6 months of cognitive remediation, with&#xD;
      each patient being their own control, defined by improvement on at least 2 tests of 1&#xD;
      standard deviation minimum.&#xD;

      Background: Despite sustained inhibition of viral replication in plasma undergoing treatment,&#xD;
      nearly 30% of HIV-infected patients have HIV-related cognitive impairment. To date, no&#xD;
      therapeutic strategy has demonstrated clinical efficacy. The initial hypothesis is to use the&#xD;
      non-medical techniques of cognitive remediation commonly practiced in the treatment of&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease or traumatic brain injury to allow improvement or even regression of&#xD;
      cognitive disorders in HIV-infected people (PHAs) who are virologically tested on&#xD;
      antiretroviral combination therapy (ART). If this hypothesis is validated, this study will&#xD;
      develop additional care structures and / or skills for the management of these cognitive&#xD;
      disorders. Some recent pilot studies using individual computer-based cognitive remediation&#xD;
      strategies show improved test performance. However, none have studied the impact of this&#xD;
      strategy on PPHIV with cognitive impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study description: A single-center pilot study evaluating the efficacy of an individual&#xD;
      cognitive remediation program for 6 months on the improvement of cognitive impairment in&#xD;
      patients with stable plasma HIV viral load that is undetectable under stable antiretroviral&#xD;
      combination (cART). cognitive disorders related to HIV infection. Cognitive remediation will&#xD;
      be based on individual face-to-face cognitive remediation sessions with a neuropsychologist&#xD;
      and on patients with severe psychiatric conditions or treatments that may interfere with&#xD;
      neuropsychological (NP) testing. this search.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Objective: The primary objective is to demonstrate improvement through a 6-month&#xD;
      individual cognitive remediation program on cognitive impairment (1 standard deviation&#xD;
      variations on 2 M6 neuropsychological tests) in controlled HIV-positive individuals under&#xD;
      cART with cognitive disorders related to HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Analyze the evolution of cognitive disorders 6 months after stopping cognitive&#xD;
           remediation,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To analyze the evolution of the cognitive disorders in the cases of a duration of the&#xD;
           remediation inferior to 6 months and superior to 2 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determine the most sensitive psychometric tests among those screened for asymptomatic&#xD;
           and minor cognitive impairment in the HIV patient&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Evaluate the impact of these therapeutic treatments on the quality of life, social&#xD;
           autonomy and self-esteem&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Characterize cognitive impairment in HIV patients according to Frascatti criteria,&#xD;
           Glissen criteria and norms routinely used in neuropsychology routinely for each test&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Describe the risk factors and co-morbidities associated with cognitive impairment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: Monocentric, prospective, pilot study of 40 patients performed in an open period&#xD;
      of 25 months. The inclusion period is 13 months and the participation duration per patient is&#xD;
      12 months. After an inclusion visit (inclusion and non-inclusion criteria checks, data&#xD;
      collection, clinical examination, psychometric test battery, Beck's scale and STAI-Y for&#xD;
      evaluation of anode-depressive symptoms), patients start 15 days of individual cognitive&#xD;
      remediation sessions. The cognitive remediation will be led by a psychologist specialized in&#xD;
      neuropsychology, trained and experienced in this method. Cognitive remediation will be&#xD;
      performed at a rate of 1 to 2 sessions per week for the duration of the study. This treatment&#xD;
      will be carried out individually for half in face-to-face session in the clinical&#xD;
      immuno-hematology department, face-to-face with the neuropsychologist, half at home with&#xD;
      computer-based home exercises using PRESCO software ® from HAPPYNEURON®. Each patient will be&#xD;
      assessed initially (M0) at 6 months (M6) and 12 months (M12: 6 months after stopping&#xD;
      cognitive remediation) with a battery of standardized neuropsychological (NP) tests performed&#xD;
      by a neuropsychologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint: Improved cognitive impairment after 6 months of cognitive remediation, with&#xD;
      each patient being their own control, defined by improvement on at least 2 tests of 1&#xD;
      standard deviation minimum.&#xD;
