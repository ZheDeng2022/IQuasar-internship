  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research is to determine a quick, accurate and unobtrusive way to optimize&#xD;
      the performance of powered assistive devices like ankle exoskeleton or prostheses.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lower limb assistive robotic devices, such as active prosthesis, orthoses, and exoskeletons&#xD;
      have the potential to restore function for the millions of Americans who experience mobility&#xD;
      challenges due to injury and disability. Since individuals with mobility challenges have an&#xD;
      increased metabolic costs of transport, the benefit of such assistive devices is commonly&#xD;
      assessed via the reduction in the metabolic work rate of the individual who is using the&#xD;
      device. Currently, metabolic work rate can only be obtained in a laboratory environment,&#xD;
      using breath-by-breath measurements of respiratory gas analysis. To obtain a single steady&#xD;
      state data point of metabolic work rate, multiple minutes of data must be collected, since&#xD;
      the signals are noisy and slow. In addition, the user has to wear a mask and bulky equipment.&#xD;
      The investigators propose an improved way to obtain such estimates of metabolic work rate in&#xD;
      real-time. In this project, the investigators will use various small sensors to optimize&#xD;
      push-off timing for an active ankle prosthesis.&#xD;
