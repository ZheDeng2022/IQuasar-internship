  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, Genocea is evaluating an investigational, personalized adjuvanted vaccine,&#xD;
      GEN-009, that is being developed for the treatment of patients with solid tumors. A&#xD;
      proprietary tool developed by Genocea, called ATLASâ„¢ (Antigen Lead Acquisition System) will&#xD;
      be used to identify neoantigens in each patient's tumor that are recognized by their CD4&#xD;
      and/or CD8 T cells. ATLAS-identified neoantigens will then be incorporated into a patient's&#xD;
      personalized vaccine in the form of synthetic long peptides (SLPs).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This first-in-human study of GEN-009 will be conducted in two parts in adult patients with&#xD;
      cutaneous melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), squamous cell carcinoma of the head&#xD;
      and neck (SCCHN), urothelial carcinoma, or renal cell carcinoma (Part B only). In Part A, the&#xD;
      safety and immunogenicity of single-agent GEN-009 will be evaluated in patients with the&#xD;
      above-noted tumor types who have completed treatment with curative intent for their disease&#xD;
      (eg, surgical resection, neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant chemotherapy, and/or radiation therapy)&#xD;
      and have no evidence of disease (NED) at the time of initiating vaccination with GEN-009. In&#xD;
      Part B, up to 15 patients in each disease cohort will be enrolled and evaluated for safety,&#xD;
      immunogenicity, and preliminary antitumor activity of GEN-009. Patients in Part B will&#xD;
      receive GEN-009 at the schedule selected in Part A, in combination with a PD-1 inhibitor&#xD;
      therapy (nivolumab or pembrolizumab) at the approved dose and schedule per the United States&#xD;
      Package Insert (USPI). In addition, up to 15 patients who enroll in one of the Part B&#xD;
      disease-specific cohorts but whose disease progresses during the screening period therapy may&#xD;
      be enrolled into a separate relapsed/refractory disease cohort.&#xD;
