  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe mental illness is accompanied by cognitive fluctuations that can alter decision-making&#xD;
      skills and lead to coerced care. Taking into account, on the one hand, the health, social and&#xD;
      economic impact of forced hospitalization, on the other hand the importance of&#xD;
      self-determination, the reinforcement of the power to act in the evolution of these&#xD;
      disorders, new strategies to better reflect the views of people have been developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among these, the drafting of Advanced Directives in Psychiatric (ADP), allows people with&#xD;
      mental disorders to write while their decision-making skills are restored care instructions&#xD;
      in case of decompensation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a tool of &quot;advanced therapeutic education&quot; and early prevention of relapses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that the implementation of drafting accompanied by advance directives to&#xD;
      people with severe psychiatric disorders decreases in the short term the number of forced&#xD;
      hospitalization care pathway of these people, compared to the subjects having not benefited&#xD;
      from this device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research will take the form of a randomized controlled trial on 3 sites. The&#xD;
      &quot;quantitative&quot; evaluation component of results and processes will be completed with a&#xD;
      qualitative anthropological and socio-political evaluation component documenting the&#xD;
      trajectories of individuals and the implementation of the program, as well as a&#xD;
      &quot;participatory research&quot; component aimed at a dialogue between users, researchers and&#xD;
      professionals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient who is a beneficiary of the &quot;Advanced Directives in Psychiatric&quot; program will be&#xD;
      encouraged to complete the &quot; Advanced Directives in Psychiatric&quot; document and will receive&#xD;
      support in drafting them. The non-beneficiary patient of the program will follow up with his&#xD;
      psychiatrist unchanged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experimental design of the quantitative component is based on an experimental,&#xD;
      randomized, prospective, controlled, parallel study, comparing two groups of subjects with&#xD;
      severe psychiatric disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research will assess the effectiveness, efficiency and impact of the &quot; Advanced&#xD;
      Directives in Psychiatric&quot; program compared to conventional psychiatric care alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultimately, the objective of describing the effects of the program on health organizations&#xD;
      and on the representations and practices of professionals, caregivers and users is at the&#xD;
      service of a better understanding of the conditions of possibility of the generalization of&#xD;
      this experimentation.&#xD;
