  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatic hemangioma is one of the most common benign tumor of the liver. Although the overall&#xD;
      prognosis is good, active interventions are still needed in high-risk patients. Without&#xD;
      specific drugs, the main treatment methods include surgical treatments, interventional&#xD;
      therapies and radiotherapies. Effective medical treatments are needed urgently. Propranolol&#xD;
      has achieved good results in infantile Facial/hepatic hemangioma, and shows some&#xD;
      effectiveness in adult hemangioma. Here, investigators intend to evaluate the therapeutic&#xD;
      effect of propranolol in adult hepatic hemangioma.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In view of the lack of medical treatment for hepatic hemangioma, investigators chose&#xD;
      hemangioma patients with a diameter of 5-10 cm and no significant risk of rupture, or those&#xD;
      with surgical indications but rejected of surgical, interventional/radiological&#xD;
      interventions. After confirmation of no high risk for drugs, oral propranolol was given. The&#xD;
      tumor size, objective remission rate, disease control rate, drugs related side effects and&#xD;
      other endpoints events were recorded and analyzed, to assess the propranolol could or&#xD;
      couldn't effectively control the progress of hepatic hemangioma.&#xD;
