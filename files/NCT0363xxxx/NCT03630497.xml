  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics of single and multiple doses of BN201 in healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a phase I, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of BN201 in healthy subjects following&#xD;
      single ascending doses and two cohorts of multiple doses. The study will be conducted in two&#xD;
      parts (Part A and Part B). Part A (up to 8 single ascending doses (SD)) will be conducted in&#xD;
      32 subjects (4 interlocking cohorts of 8 subjects). Part B (up to 2 multiple ascending doses&#xD;
      (MD)) will be conducted in 16 subjects (2 cohorts of 8 subjects). Subjects in Part A will&#xD;
      undergo a screening period (Day -28 to Day -2), two in-patient treatment periods compromising&#xD;
      3 overnight stays (from Day -1 to Day 3) with a wash out period of at least 14 days between&#xD;
      dose administrations and a follow up visit 12 to 16 days following administration of IMP.&#xD;
      Subjects in Part B will undergo a screening period (Day -28 to Day -2), an in-patient&#xD;
      treatment period compromising 7 overnight stays (from Day -1 to Day 7) and a follow up visit&#xD;
      12 to 16 days following final administration of Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP).&#xD;

      Screening (Days -28 to -2) Screening assessments will be performed within 28 days of the&#xD;
      first dose to ensure the eligibility of participants. Assessments will include medical&#xD;
      history, demographics, concomitant medication check, physical examination, body weight,&#xD;
      height, BMI, HIV, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C screen, drugs of abuse and alcohol screen,&#xD;
      routine laboratory assessments (biochemistry, haematology and urinalysis), 12-lead ECG, EEG&#xD;
      monitoring, brain MRI scan, vital signs (supine systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse)&#xD;
      and body temperature. Female participants will also be screened for pregnancy and hormone&#xD;
      status. A C-SSRS questionnaire will also be performed at screening for Part B only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Period&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to four cohorts ((SD1), (SD2), (SD3), (SD4)) of eight subjects will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      to receive either two single intravenous doses of BN201, two single intravenous doses of&#xD;
      placebo or one single intravenous dose of BN201 and placebo (per treatment period) over two&#xD;
      treatment periods (Period 1 and Period 2). Within each cohort, 6 subjects will receive BN201&#xD;
      and 2 subjects will receive placebo. Two &quot;dose leader&quot; subjects will be dosed on the same&#xD;
      day, at least 48 h before the remaining subjects in the cohort. Of these two subjects, one&#xD;
      will be dosed with BN201 and the other with placebo. The Chief Investigator (or delegate)&#xD;
      must confirm it is safe to continue with the dosing of the remainder of the cohort following&#xD;
      review of appropriate safety data. The remaining 6 subjects of the cohort (five randomised to&#xD;
      active and one to placebo) will then be dosed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be admitted to the clinical unit in the morning of Day -1 and will remain in&#xD;
      the unit until the 48 h post dose scheduled assessments and procedures have been performed&#xD;
      (Day 3). On Day -1 of each Treatment Period subjects' eligibility will be re-assessed and&#xD;
      blood and urine samples will be collected for laboratory safety tests (including drugs of&#xD;
      abuse and alcohol screen, biochemistry, haematology, urinalysis and serum pregnancy test). A&#xD;
      12-lead ECG, vital signs (supine systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse), body&#xD;
      temperature, adverse event and concomitant medication checks will be performed. The&#xD;
      intravenous dose of BN201 or placebo will be based on body weight measured on Day -1. An&#xD;
      evening snack will be consumed at least 10 hours (h) before (each) dose administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After an overnight fast of at least 10 h, dose administration will occur on the morning of&#xD;
      Day 1 between 08:00 and 11:00 whilst subjects are in a semi supine position. The subjects&#xD;
      will remain in this position until 2 h post-infusion, however other positions are temporarily&#xD;
      allowed for scheduled assessment requirements. Fasting will continue until 4 h after start of&#xD;
      infusion; a standardised meal will then be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be discharged from the clinical unit on Day 3 (48 h post-dose) providing there&#xD;
      are no ongoing safety concerns. There will be a wash out period of at least 14 days between&#xD;
      dose administrations prior to subjects returning for their treatment 2 scheduled assessments&#xD;
      and procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following assessments will be made during treatment Period 1 and Period 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety assessments: Adverse event (AEs) and concomitant medication check, physical&#xD;
           examination, laboratory safety assessments (drugs of abuse and alcohol screen,&#xD;
           biochemistry, haematology, urinalysis and serum pregnancy test), 12-lead ECG, telemetry,&#xD;
           Holter monitoring, EEG monitoring, vital signs (supine systolic and diastolic blood&#xD;
           pressure, pulse) and body temperature, infusion site reaction assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pharmacokinetics (PK) assessments: Blood sample collection for measurement of BN201 in&#xD;
           plasma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pharmacodynamics (PD) assessments: Blood sample collection for measurement of&#xD;
           phosphorylation of N-myc downstream-regulated gene 1 (NDGR1) in peripheral blood&#xD;
           mononuclear cells (PBMCs).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pharmacogenomic assessments: Blood sample will be collected for potential genotyping of&#xD;
           deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequence variants to explore potential relationships with&#xD;
           PK/PD and or tolerability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A follow-up visit (including a brain MRI scan) will be conducted 12 to 16 days following each&#xD;
      administration of IMP. If all follow-up assessments are satisfactory to the Investigator&#xD;
      following Treatment Period 2 the subject will be discharged from the study. If any AEs are&#xD;
      ongoing, or any assessments not satisfactory subjects may be recalled to the unit for&#xD;
      follow-up assessments until the Investigator is satisfied the subject may be discharged from&#xD;
      the study. Subjects will be advised to return or contact the unit at any time if they may be&#xD;
      experiencing any adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolment of the subsequent cohort will only proceed, if blinded PK and safety data from the&#xD;
      previous cohort has been reviewed by the Sponsor and Chief Investigator and is found to be&#xD;
      satisfactory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two cohorts (MD1, MD2) of eight subjects will be randomly assigned to receive either multiple&#xD;
      intravenous doses of BN201 or multiple intravenous doses of placebo once daily for five&#xD;
      consecutive days (Day 1 to Day 5). Within each cohort, 6 subjects will receive BN201 and 2&#xD;
      subjects will receive placebo. Two &quot;dose leader&quot; subjects will be dosed on the same day, at&#xD;
      least 48 h before the remaining subjects in the cohort. Of these two subjects, one will be&#xD;
      dosed with BN201 and the other with placebo. The Chief Investigator (or delegate) must&#xD;
      confirm it is safe to continue with the dosing of the remainder of the cohort following&#xD;
      review of appropriate safety data. The remaining 6 subjects of the cohort (five randomised to&#xD;
      active and one to placebo) will then be dosed. The dose levels to be administered will be&#xD;
      based on the safety, tolerability and PK results of Part A. Cohort MD1 can only be started if&#xD;
      a higher dose level in the SAD part was well tolerated and that simulated PK modelling for&#xD;
      multiple dose administration based on PK data from single doses do not suggest that the Cmax&#xD;
      threshold of 13.3 μg/mL will be exceeded. Enrolment of MD2 will only proceed if blinded PK&#xD;
      and safety data from subjects in MD1 has been reviewed by the Sponsor and Chief Investigator&#xD;
      and is found to be satisfactory. A lower dose may be chosen if deemed appropriate following&#xD;
      review of PK and safety data from Part A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be admitted to the clinical unit in the morning of Day -1 and will remain in&#xD;
      the unit until the scheduled assessments and procedures have been performed on Day 7, 48 h&#xD;
      post-last dose. On Day -1 subjects' eligibility will be re-assessed and blood and urine&#xD;
      samples will be collected for laboratory safety tests (including drugs of abuse and alcohol&#xD;
      screen, biochemistry, haematology, urinalysis and serum pregnancy test). A 12-lead ECG, vital&#xD;
      signs (supine systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse), body temperature, quantitative&#xD;
      sensory testing (QST) and visual analogue scale (VAS) and adverse event and concomitant&#xD;
      medication checks will be performed. The intravenous dose of BN201 or placebo will be based&#xD;
      on body weight measured on Day -1. An evening snack will be consumed at least 10 h before&#xD;
      (each) dose administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After an overnight fast of at least 10 h, dose administration will occur on the mornings of&#xD;
      Day 1 to Day 5 between 08:00 and 11:00 whilst subjects are in a semi supine position. The&#xD;
      subjects will remain in this position until 2 h post-infusion, however other positions are&#xD;
      temporarily allowed for scheduled assessment requirements. Fasting will continue until 4 h&#xD;
      after start of infusion; a standardised meal will then be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be discharged from the clinical unit on Day 7 providing there are no ongoing&#xD;
      safety concerns. The following assessments will be made during Day -1 to Day 7:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety assessments: Adverse event (AEs) and concomitant medication check, physical&#xD;
           examination, laboratory safety assessments (drugs of abuse and alcohol screen,&#xD;
           biochemistry, haematology and urinalysis and serum pregnancy test), 12-lead ECG,&#xD;
           telemetry, Holter monitoring, EEG monitoring*, vital signs (supine systolic and&#xD;
           diastolic blood pressure, pulse) and body temperature, infusion site reaction&#xD;
           assessment, C-SSRS questionnaire, QST and VAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PK assessments: Blood sample collection for measurement of BN201 in plasma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PD assessments: Blood sample collection for measurement of phosphorylation of N-myc&#xD;
           downstream-regulated gene 1 (NDGR1) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pharmacogenomic assessments: Blood sample will be collected for potential genotyping of&#xD;
           deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequence variants to explore potential relationships with&#xD;
           PK/PD and or tolerability.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  EEG monitoring only performed for Part B Cohort 2 if indicated from results from&#xD;
                Part B Cohort 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      A follow-up visit (including a brain MRI scan) will be conducted 12 to 16 days following the&#xD;
      subjects' final administration of IMP. If all follow up assessments are satisfactory to the&#xD;
      Investigator, the subject will be discharged from the study. If any AEs are ongoing, or any&#xD;
      assessments not satisfactory subjects may be recalled to the unit for follow-up assessments&#xD;
      until the Investigator is satisfied the subject may be discharged from the study. Subjects&#xD;
      will be advised to return or contact the unit at any time if they may be experiencing any&#xD;
      adverse effects.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        To be confirmed at screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Healthy male and female subjects between 18 and 55 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. *Healthy subjects as determined by past medical history and as judged by the PI&#xD;
             (including no significant infection in the last 3 months before trial enrolment).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. *Female subject of non-child bearing potential with negative pregnancy test at&#xD;
             screening and each admission to the clinical unit. For the purposes of this study,&#xD;
             this is defined as the subject being amenorrheic for at least 12 consecutive months or&#xD;
             at least 4 months post-surgical sterilisation (including bilateral fallopian tube&#xD;
             ligation or bilateral oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy). Menopausal status&#xD;
             will be confirmed by demonstrating at screening that levels of follicle stimulating&#xD;
             hormone (FSH) fall within the respective pathology reference range. In the event a&#xD;
             subject's menopause status has been clearly established (for example, the subject&#xD;
             indicates she has been amenorrheic for 10 years), but FSH levels are not consistent&#xD;
             with a post-menopausal condition, determination of subject eligibility will be at&#xD;
             Investigator's discretion following consultation with the Sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. *Female subjects of child bearing potential must be non-pregnant and non-lactating&#xD;
             with negative pregnancy test at screening and each admission to the clinical unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. *Female subjects of child bearing potential and male subjects with female partners of&#xD;
             child bearing potential must take one highly effective contraceptive precaution in&#xD;
             addition to one acceptable contraceptive precaution (i.e., barrier precaution) from&#xD;
             first dose until 3 months after last dose of IMP (as detailed in Section 9.4.1).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. *Male subject willing to use an effective method of contraception or 2 effective&#xD;
             methods of contraception, i.e., highly effective method of contraception + condom, if&#xD;
             applicable (unless anatomically sterile or where abstaining from sexual intercourse is&#xD;
             in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject) from first dose until 3&#xD;
             months after last dose of IMP.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. *Subject with a body weight of ≥ 50.0 kg and ≤100 kg and have a body mass index (BMI)&#xD;
             of 18-32 kg/m2. BMI = body weight (kg) / [height (m)]2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. *Subject with no clinically significant history of previous allergy / sensitivity to&#xD;
             BN201 or any of the excipients contained within the IMP.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. *Subject with no clinically significant abnormal serum biochemistry, haematology and&#xD;
             urine examination values within 28 days before the first dose of IMP.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. *Subject with a negative urinary drugs of abuse screen, determined within 28 days&#xD;
             before the first dose of IMP (N.B. a positive alcohol result may be repeated at&#xD;
             Investigator's discretion).&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Subject with negative human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B surface&#xD;
             antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis C virus antibody (HCV) results.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. *Subject with no clinically significant abnormalities in 12-lead electrocardiogram&#xD;
             ((QTcF ≤ 430 ms) and (PR 120 - 200 ms)) determined within 28 days before first dose of&#xD;
             IMP.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Subjects with no clinically significant abnormalities in electroencephalogram (EEG)&#xD;
             determined within 28 days before first dose of IMP.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. *Subject with no clinically significant abnormalities in vital signs (supine systolic&#xD;
             and diastolic blood pressure, pulse) and body temperature determined within 28 days&#xD;
             before first dose of IMP.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Subject must be available to complete the study (including all follow up visits).&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Subject must satisfy the investigator / designee about their fitness to participate in&#xD;
             the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Subject must be willing and able to sign the written informed consent to participate&#xD;
             in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Subjects must not donate sperm for the first dose and for at least 3 months after the&#xD;
             last dose of IMP.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Subject with no clinically significant abnormalities in brain MRI scan determined&#xD;
             within 28 days before first dose of IMP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        To be re-confirmed on Day -1 / prior to dosing:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subject continues to meet all screening inclusion criteria indicated with * (BMI will&#xD;
             only apply to screening).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject with a negative urinary drugs of abuse screen (including alcohol) prior to&#xD;
             dosing.&#xD;

             replacements (i.e., e-cigarettes, nicotine patches or gums).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Inability to communicate well with Investigators (i.e., language problem, poor mental&#xD;
             development or impaired cerebral function).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Participation in a New Chemical Entity clinical study within the previous 3 months or&#xD;

             compromise subject safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Participation in a clinical study since the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Donation of 450 mL or more blood within the 3 months before the first dose of IMP and&#xD;
