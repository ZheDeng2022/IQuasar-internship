      The Exercising Together trial is a single-blind, parallel group, randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      comparing 3 arms: Arm 1 (experimental): Exercising Together where couples perform partnered&#xD;
      exercise in a supervised, group setting versus two comparator conditions where survivors and&#xD;
      partners perform exercise routines separately in either a supervised group setting (Arm 2) or&#xD;
      unsupervised at home (Arm 3). All three arms will train for a 6-month period and then be&#xD;
      followed 6 months later. Data will be collected at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the efficacy of Exercising Together on relationship quality (intimacy,&#xD;
      communication and incongruence) in couples coping with prostate cancer (PC), breast cancer&#xD;
      (BC), or colorectal cancer (CRC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the efficacy of Exercising Together on the physical health (body composition,&#xD;
      lipids, insulin resistance, blood pressure, inflammation, and physical function) and mental&#xD;
      health (anxiety, depressive symptoms, fear of recurrence) of both the survivor and&#xD;
      spouse/partner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Determine how long individual and couple-level benefits from Exercising Together last.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Identify the types of couples that benefit most from Exercising Together.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Study is a 3-group, 12-month (6 months of exercise training + 6-months follow-up)&#xD;
      randomized trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Exercising Together Program: Couples perform partnered exercise over 1 hour, 2 days&#xD;
      per week in a supervised, group setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Exercising Together Program: Couples perform partnered exercise over 1 hour, 2 days&#xD;
      per week in a supervised, group setting&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM III: Survivors and partners undergo 2 training sessions over 1 hour with an exercise&#xD;
      trainer and then perform exercise routines over 1 hour 2 days per week separately&#xD;
      unsupervised at home or a facility following an instructional digital video disc (DVD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The basic training program for all three study arms is a functional strength training&#xD;
      program. Participants will use free weights (weighted vest, dumbbells, elastic bands) while&#xD;
      performing lower body (chair rises, squats, lunges, stepups) and upper body (1-arm row, bench&#xD;
      press, push-ups, triceps extension, bicep curls, shoulder raise) resistance exercise. Volume&#xD;
      of resistance exercise, determined by intensity (weight, tailored to each individual) and&#xD;
      duration (number of repetitions and sets), is gradually increased from low weight and high&#xD;
      repetitions to more weight and fewer repetitions over the training period.&#xD;
