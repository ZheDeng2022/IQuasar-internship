  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 4, randomized, open-label, multicenter trial to evaluate the efficacy of a&#xD;
      single injected dose of Benzathine Penicillin G (BPG) 2.4 MU (Arm 1) compared to three&#xD;
      successive weekly injected doses of BPG 2.4 MU (Arm 2) for treatment of early syphilis in&#xD;
      human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected and HIV-uninfected subjects. The study will&#xD;
      enroll 560 adults (to achieve 420 evaluable subjects) aged 18 years or older with untreated&#xD;
      early syphilis (primary, secondary, or early latent). It will be conducted at 9 sites in the&#xD;
      US and last for 48 months with patient participation duration of 12 months. The primary&#xD;
      objective is to compare the serological response to therapy in subjects with early (primary,&#xD;
      secondary, or early latent) syphilis treated with Benzathine Penicillin G (BPG) 2.4 million&#xD;
      units (MU) once or weekly for three successive weeks.&#xD;

      determine if the difference in response to therapy between treatment arms by Month 6 differs&#xD;
      among subjects with or without HIV infection; 2) to determine the impact of multiple BPG&#xD;
      injected doses on subject compliance with study product and adherence to the corresponding&#xD;
      scheduled visits; 3) to determine the incidence and manifestations of the Jarisch-Herxheimer&#xD;
      reaction among subjects treated for early syphilis with BPG; 4) to collect prospective data&#xD;
      up to Month 12 on the serological response to therapy in subjects treated for early syphilis&#xD;
      with either BPG regimen; 5) to compare epidemiological characteristics of early syphilis&#xD;
      among subjects with or without HIV infection.&#xD;
