  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, Phase 1 study of ABBV-011 given as a single agent and in&#xD;
      combination with budigalimab (ABBV-181) in participants with relapsed or refractory small&#xD;
      cell lung cancer (SCLC). The study consists of 4 parts: Part A is a single-agent ABBV-011&#xD;
      dose regimen finding cohort; followed by Part B, a single-agent ABBV-011 dose expansion&#xD;
      cohort; and then Part C, an ABBV-011 and budigalimab (ABBV-181) combination escalation and&#xD;
      expansion cohort; Part D, single-agent ABBV-011 dose-evaluating cohort for Japan.&#xD;

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. The investigator assesses the relationship of each event to the use of study. A serious adverse event (SAE) is an event that results in death, is life-threatening, requires or prolongs hospitalization, results in a congenital anomaly, persistent or significant disability/incapacity or is an important medical event that, based on medical judgment, may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed above.</description>
