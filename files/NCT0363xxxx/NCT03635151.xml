  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Caring for a family member after a stroke can be very difficult and worsen the physical and&#xD;
      mental health of untrained caregivers. The Telephone Assessment and Skill-Building Kit (TASK&#xD;
      III) intervention is a unique, comprehensive caregiver intervention program that enables&#xD;
      caregivers to develop the necessary skills to manage care for the survivor, while also taking&#xD;
      care of themselves. The long-term goal of this study is to offer training and support for&#xD;
      family caregivers through an efficacious, cost-effective program.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is a leading cause of serious, long-term disability, and has a very sudden onset;&#xD;
      families are often thrust into providing care without any training from health care&#xD;
      providers. Studies have shown that caregiving without training can be detrimental to&#xD;
      caregiver's physical and mental health, which can impede survivor rehabilitation and lead to&#xD;
      institutionalization and higher societal costs. Unlike existing stroke caregiver&#xD;
      interventions that require costly face to face interactions, and that focus primarily on the&#xD;
      survivor's care, the Telephone Assessment and Skill-Building Kit (TASK II) is delivered&#xD;
      completely by telephone, and empowers caregivers to address both their own and the survivor's&#xD;
      needs using innovative skill-building strategies. Aligned with current patient and caregiver&#xD;
      guidelines, TASK II has demonstrated evidence of content validity, treatment fidelity,&#xD;
      caregiver satisfaction, and efficacy for reducing depressive symptoms; however, future&#xD;
      development of TASK II requires a stronger focus on self-management strategies to improve&#xD;
      caregiver health, and enhanced use of other telehealth modes of delivery prior to&#xD;
      implementation into ongoing stroke systems of care. The purpose of this study is to optimize&#xD;
      the TASK III intervention through the innovative leveraging of technologies and&#xD;
      theoretically-based self-management strategies to improve caregiver health. Specific Aim 1&#xD;
      consists of focus groups and individual interviews with 40 experts (10 interdisciplinary&#xD;
      researchers, 10 technology experts, 10 clinicians and clinical leaders, and 10 stroke family&#xD;
      caregivers) to provide preferences about essential areas of new self-management content,&#xD;
      proposed technologies (e.g., iBook, eBook, interactive website, FaceTime, Zoom), and future&#xD;
      implementation strategies to inform a novel TASK III prototype. Specific Aim 2 will determine&#xD;
      feasibility of the TASK III intervention with a pilot study of 74 stroke caregivers&#xD;
      randomized to TASK III or an Information, Support, and Referral (ISR) group in preparation&#xD;
      for a larger randomized controlled clinical trial. Recruitment, retention, treatment&#xD;
      fidelity, satisfaction, and technology ratings will be obtained for both TASK III and ISR&#xD;
      groups who will receive 8 weekly sessions with a booster session 4 weeks later. Outcome&#xD;
      measures will be explored at baseline, 8 weeks (end of intervention), and 12 weeks (after&#xD;
      booster). If TASK III is shown to be efficacious in a future randomized controlled clinical&#xD;
      trial, our next goal will be to translate TASK III into ongoing stroke systems of care; and,&#xD;
      someday to adapt it for use among caregivers with other debilitating/chronic conditions&#xD;
      providing a tremendous public health impact.&#xD;

    <measure>Caregiver satisfaction ratings for both TASK III and ISR programs measured by the Caregiver Satisfaction Scale (CSS).</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Caregiver satisfaction ratings (usability, ease of use, acceptability) for both TASK III and ISR programs are measured using the Caregiver Satisfaction Scale (CSS). The CSS consists of 9 items rated on a response scale ranging from 1 = Strongly Disagree to 5 = Strongly Agree. Items are summed for a total score with a possible range of 9 to 45. Higher scores indicate greater satisfaction.</description>

    <measure>Depressive symptoms measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire Depression Scale (PHQ-9).</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 8 and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Caregiver depressive symptoms are measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire Depression Scale (PHQ-9) consisting of 9 items rated on a response scale ranging from 0 = Not at all to 3 = Nearly every day. Items are summed for a total score with a possible range of 0 to 27. Higher scores indicate higher depressive symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Life Changes (i.e., changes in social functioning, subjective well-being, and physical health as a result of providing care) measured by the Bakas Caregiving Outcomes Scale (BCOS).</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 8 and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Caregiver life changes (i.e., changes in social functioning, subjective well-being, and physical health as a result of providing care) are measured by the Bakas Caregiving Outcomes Scale (BCOS). The BCOS consists of 15 items rated on a response scale ranging from -3 (changed for the worst) to +3 (Changed for the best). The items are recoded (-3 = 1) (-2 = 2) (-1 = 3) (0 = 4) (1 = 5) (2 = 6) (3 = 7) so that positive numbers can be obtained for analysis. The recoded responses to the 15 items are summed for a total score with a possible range of 15-105. Higher scores indicate more positive life changes as a result of providing care.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Unhealthy Days measured by the number of unhealthy days in the past 30 days.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 8 and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Caregiver unhealthy days are measured using the Unhealthy Days (UD) measure consisting of two items: How many days during the past 30 days was your physical health not good?; How many days during the past 30 days was your mental health not good? These items range from 0 = no unhealthy days to 30 = 30 unhealthy days. The two items are summed for a total score, with a cap of 30 days. Higher scores indicate more unhealthy days in the past 30 days.</description>
