    <textblock>
      To explore in a pilot randomized clinical trial, the impact of Home Blood Pressure Monitoring&#xD;
      with patient directed information as compared to usual care on the postoperative management&#xD;
      of blood pressure.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The intervention and control groups will be defined by, 1) preoperative home blood pressure&#xD;
      monitoring with a detailed report sent to the patient, and 2) usual standard of care&#xD;
      including a suggestion during the pre-operative clinic appointment to follow up with Primary&#xD;
      Care. Both groups will receive a brief questionnaire about their blood pressure treatment and&#xD;
      medication adherence. We will examine the rate of primary care follow-up and changes in&#xD;
      hypertension treatment at 60 days post-operative, through a telephone call. This information,&#xD;
      along with information regarding patient acceptance of the intervention will be used to&#xD;
      inform the design of a future clinical trial powered to outcomes, including follow-up visits&#xD;
      and blood pressure management.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  We propose to recruit patients who present for ambulatory surgery, aged &gt;18 years,&#xD;
             with a preoperative blood pressure &gt; 140/90 mmHg taken as the mean of two readings&#xD;
             during the pre-admission testing visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are unable or unwilling to be contacted by telephone, are non-English&#xD;
             speaking, or are unable to operate an automated home blood pressure monitor will also&#xD;
             be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy patients with blood pressure readings that fall within the American Heart&#xD;
