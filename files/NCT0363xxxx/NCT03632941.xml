    <textblock>
      In this phase II study, study subjects will receive the VRP-HER2 immunizations plus&#xD;
      pembrolizumab. There will be an initial Safety Arm during which subjects will receive the&#xD;
      VRP-HER2 immunizations plus pembrolizumab. If there is no dose limiting toxicity in the&#xD;
      Safety Arm, then subjects will be randomized into 3 arms. They will undergo a biopsy of their&#xD;
      tumor and peripheral blood draw for immune cell analyses and be assigned to the applicable&#xD;
      arm of the study. Arm A will consist of the the VRP-HER2 immunizations; Arm B will consist of&#xD;
      pembrolizumab; Arm C will consist of the VRP-HER2 immunizations plus pembrolizumab.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this phase II study is to determine whether pembrolizumab increases&#xD;
      the tumor infiltrating and peripheral blood immune response to the VRP-HER2 vaccine. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that HER2 specific T cell responses and anti-tumor immunity induced&#xD;
      with HER2 vaccination will be augmented by concurrent anti-PD-1 antibody therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will additionally determine whether the administration of pembrolizumab is&#xD;
      safe in patients with recurrent or metastatic HER2+ cancers who are receiving the anti-HER2&#xD;
      vaccine VRP-HER2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be an initial Safety Arm (n=3) during which subjects will receive the VRP-HER2&#xD;
      immunizations plus pembrolizumab and if there is no dose limiting toxicity in the Safety Arm,&#xD;
      subjects will then be randomized 1:1:1 into 3 arms (n=12 per arm). Subjects with metastatic&#xD;
      HER2 overexpressing breast cancer receiving trastuzumab and pertuzumab will continue these&#xD;
      antibodies. They will undergo a biopsy of their tumor and peripheral blood draw for immune&#xD;
      cell analyses and be assigned to the applicable arm of the study. Arm A will consist of the&#xD;
      the VRP-HER2 immunizations; Arm B will consist of pembrolizumab; Arm C will consist of the&#xD;
      VRP-HER2 immunizations plus pembrolizumab. Tumor biopsies and peripheral blood draws will be&#xD;
      performed following the course of immunizations.&#xD;
