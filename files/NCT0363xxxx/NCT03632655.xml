  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized trial will compare the safety and efficacy of TPM versus TRUS biopsies&#xD;
      performed in the outpatient setting. Primary endpoints will be pain as well as detection of&#xD;
      clinically significant disease (defined as Gleason Score &gt;=7 or cancer core length &gt;=6 mm).&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints will be detection of any prostate cancer, hospital re-admissions within&#xD;
      30 days, aborted procedures due to discomfort, procedure time, adverse events including&#xD;
      hematuria, urinary retention, hematospermia, hematochezia, and infection, and&#xD;
      patient-reported outcomes as measured on validated instruments such as International Prostate&#xD;
      Symptom Scores (IPSS) and International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5). In men who&#xD;
      subsequently elect to undergo radical prostatectomy for definitive treatment of their&#xD;
      prostate cancer, Gleason scores at final pathology will be correlated to the Gleason scores&#xD;
      obtained at time of biopsy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The feasibility of outpatient TPM has been well demonstrated.(Bianco &amp; Mart√≠nez-Salamanca,&#xD;
      2016; Merrick et al., 2016; Smith et al., 2014) New technology now allows for fusion of MRI&#xD;
      images with TPM devices, allowing for targeting of cancerous-appearing lesions on MRI. Such&#xD;
      technology that fuses MRI-imaging with TRUS biopsy has become routine in U.S. clinical&#xD;
      practice, with improved cancer detection rates as compared with standard TRUS.(Ahmed et al.,&#xD;
      2017; Robertson, Emberton, &amp; Moore, 2013)&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized trial will compare the safety and efficacy of TPM versus TRUS biopsies&#xD;
      performed in the outpatient setting. Men will be randomized to receiving either TPM or TRUS&#xD;
      targeted biopsy. All men will receive a urine culture within 2 weeks of biopsy and will be&#xD;
      started on antibiotic prophylaxis prior to biopsy in accordance with AUA antimicrobial&#xD;
      prophylaxis guidelines. Men with a positive urine culture will be treated with&#xD;
      culture-specific antibiotics and must have a documented negative urine culture prior to&#xD;
      biopsy.&#xD;

    <description>Detection of clinically significant disease&#xD;
Typical Gleason Scores range from 6-10. The higher the Gleason Score, the more likely that the cancer will grow and spread quickly.&#xD;
Scores of 6 or less describe cancer cells that look similar to normal cells and suggest that the cancer is likely to grow slowly.&#xD;
A score of 7 suggests and intermediate risk for aggressive cancer. Scoring a 7 means that the primary score (largest section of the tumor) scored a 3 or 4. Tumors with a primary score of 3 and a secondary score of 4 have a fairly good outlook, whereas cancers with a primary Gleason Score of 4 and a secondary score of 3, are more likely to grow and spread.&#xD;
Scores of 8 or higher describe cancers that are likely to spread more rapidly, these cancers are often referred to as poorly differentiated or high grade.</description>

    <description>EPIC-CP comprises of 10 questions about the patient within the last four weeks.&#xD;
Questions 1,7,8,9 are each graded on a scale from 0-4 for a total of 12 points. Higher scores indicate worse quality of life with regards to urinary and sexual function.&#xD;
Questions 2-4 grade Urinary Incontinence Symptoms on a scale from 0-4 (max 12 points). Higher scores indicate worse urinary incontinence symptoms.&#xD;
Questions 5a-c grade Urinary Irritation/Obstructive Symptoms on a scale from 0-4 (max 12 poitns). Higher scores indicate worse urinary irritation/obstructive symptoms.&#xD;
Questions 6a-c grade Bowel Symptoms on a scale from 0-4 (max 12 points). Higher scores indicate worse bowel symptoms.&#xD;
Questions 10a-c grade Vitality/Hormonal Symptoms on a scale from 0-4 (max 12 points). Higher scores indicate worse vitality/hormonal symptoms.&#xD;
All scores are summed (max 60 points) to calculate the Overall Prostate Cancer QOL score. Higher score indicates worse patient-reported QOL.</description>

        <description>Detection of clinically significant disease&#xD;
Typical Gleason Scores range from 6-10. The higher the Gleason Score, the more likely that the cancer will grow and spread quickly.&#xD;
Scores of 6 or less describe cancer cells that look similar to normal cells and suggest that the cancer is likely to grow slowly.&#xD;
A score of 7 suggests and intermediate risk for aggressive cancer. Scoring a 7 means that the primary score (largest section of the tumor) scored a 3 or 4. Tumors with a primary score of 3 and a secondary score of 4 have a fairly good outlook, whereas cancers with a primary Gleason Score of 4 and a secondary score of 3, are more likely to grow and spread.&#xD;
Scores of 8 or higher describe cancers that are likely to spread more rapidly, these cancers are often referred to as poorly differentiated or high grade.</description>

Questions 1,7,8,9 are each graded on a scale from 0-4 for a total of 12 points. Higher scores indicate worse quality of life with regards to urinary and sexual function.&#xD;
Questions 2-4 grade Urinary Incontinence Symptoms on a scale from 0-4 (max 12 points). Higher scores indicate worse urinary incontinence symptoms.&#xD;
Questions 5a-c grade Urinary Irritation/Obstructive Symptoms on a scale from 0-4 (max 12 poitns). Higher scores indicate worse urinary irritation/obstructive symptoms.&#xD;
Questions 6a-c grade Bowel Symptoms on a scale from 0-4 (max 12 points). Higher scores indicate worse bowel symptoms.&#xD;
Questions 10a-c grade Vitality/Hormonal Symptoms on a scale from 0-4 (max 12 points). Higher scores indicate worse vitality/hormonal symptoms.&#xD;
All scores are summed (max 60 points) to calculate the Overall Prostate Cancer QOL score. Higher score indicates worse patient-reported QOL.</description>
