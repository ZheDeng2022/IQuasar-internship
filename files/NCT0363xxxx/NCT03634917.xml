      Validation of a Test System to develop new medications for alcoholism (TEMA)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 'TEMA', a progressive-work alcohol self-administration paradigm, can be validated by&#xD;
      reproducing the effect of Acamprosate and prove the effect of Calcium to reduce motivation to&#xD;
      work for alcohol after 14 - 19 days of treatment during a period of 15 - 20 days of alcohol&#xD;
      abstinence in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled three-arm parallel-group design.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Objective of this study is to show that a laboratory alcohol self-administration method can&#xD;
      predict the therapeutic potential of new compounds to reduce relapse in alcohol-dependent&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 'TEMA' translates several animal behavioral paradigms of alcohol self-administration into&#xD;
      corresponding human experiments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      84 at least high risky drinkers (WHO) with at least mild alcohol use disorder perform two&#xD;
      alcohol self-administration experiments, one before and one after 14-19 days of randomized&#xD;
      double-blinded treatment with Acamprosate, Calcium Carbonate or Placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each alcohol request requires prior work in a constant attention task according to a&#xD;
      progressive schedule to earn the next alcohol infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives refer to investigations, whether&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. administration of Acamprosate or Calcium Carbonate in comparison to placebo leads to a&#xD;
           change in perception of subjective alcohol effects&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. effectiveness of Acamprosate or Calcium can be predicted by calcium parameters (baseline&#xD;
           and changes during medication period)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. administration of Acamprosate or Calcium leads to a reduction in alcohol craving&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Frequency of alcohol consumption during the imposed abstinence period differs between&#xD;
           treatment groups and influences primary outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. study participation modifies motivation to change drinking habits and utilization of&#xD;
           addiction care services&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) activities are applicable as biomarker and predictor of&#xD;
           medication effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. safety issues occur due to study medication&#xD;
