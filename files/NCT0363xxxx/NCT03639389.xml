  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is the commonest cancer form in men in Northern Europe. Management of the&#xD;
      cancer often includes surgical removal of the primary tumor. In the last 5-10 years, robot&#xD;
      assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) has become common. Good pain relief is central to&#xD;
      early mobilization and greater patient satisfaction. Randomized controlled studies on pain&#xD;
      relief following RALP are few and the role of spinal analgesia in pain management following&#xD;
      robotic surgery has not been described. Techniques available for pain relief following RALP&#xD;
      include spinal anesthesia with or without opiates, intravenous analgesia with morphine or a&#xD;
      multimodal pain management technique using a combination of several analgesics. Spinal&#xD;
      anesthesia and analgesia reduces the surgical stress and inflammatory response following&#xD;
      laparoscopic colorectal surgery and may offer similar benefit even during RALP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early perioperative complications may cause postoperative morbidity following robotic&#xD;
      surgery, and sometimes delay home discharge. Since all robotic operations in the pelvic&#xD;
      region are performed in a deep Trendelenberg position, this can even have negative&#xD;
      consequences for the heart, brain and the lungs. Cardiac complications in the form of minimal&#xD;
      cardiac injury or mild heart failure have not been previously studied following RALP.&#xD;
      Additionally, patients are sometimes delirious in the early postoperative period following&#xD;
      RALP. The precise cause for this remains unclear and may be related to pain, cognitive&#xD;
      dysfunction or an urge to pass urine despite a urinary catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to good postoperative pain relief, early postoperative mobilization and home&#xD;
      discharge are important milestones in recovery of full function following major surgery. With&#xD;
      improvement in surgical technique, the time has come to evaluate if RALP can be performed on&#xD;
      an ambulatory basis. The main aims of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Can RALP be performed on an ambulatory basis and patients ready to be discharged home at&#xD;
           8 pm?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine if spinal anesthesia reduces pre-discharge pain intensity, stress response&#xD;
           and other perioperative side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Is sufentanil or fentanyl the analgesic of choice when administered spinally together&#xD;
           with bupivacaine as an analgesic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To determine the frequency and severity of cardiac and respiratory complications in the&#xD;
           steep Trendelenberg position during RALP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To assess the quality of recovery, quality of life and activities of daily living&#xD;
           following ambulatory RALP?&#xD;

      Prospective, randomized study blinded to observers (spinal or no-spinal). All formal&#xD;
      approvals will be obtained from different authorities prior to study start. It will be&#xD;
      registered in an international database (clinicaltrials.gov).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients &gt; 18 years, ASA I-III, undergoing RALP will be included into the study. Patients on&#xD;
      chronic opiate medication, those with contraindications to spinal anesthesia or allergy to&#xD;
      any component drugs used during spinal anesthesia or other analgesics used in the study will&#xD;
      be excluded. Patients living alone or having no adult at home to look after them during the&#xD;
      first 24 h after home discharge will also be excluded. Informed written consent will be&#xD;
      obtained from all patients. On the morning of surgery, all patients will receive paracetamol&#xD;
      1 g orally 1 h before planned surgery, and will be randomized to one of two groups as shown&#xD;
      below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) (morning surgery)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Group MM: This group of patients will not receive spinal anesthesia but have multimodal&#xD;
           pain management including COX-2 blockers, pregabalin and oxycontin for pain management&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Group SF (Spinal/Fentanyl): Spinal anesthesia with bupivacaine 12.5 mg+fentanyl 15 ug&#xD;
           Robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) (afternoon surgery)&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Group MM: This group of patients will not receive spinal anesthesia but have multimodal&#xD;
      pain management including COX-2 blockers, pregabalin and oxycontin for pain management 2.&#xD;
      Group SS (Spinal/Sufentanil): Spinal anesthesia with bupivacaine 12.5 mg+sufentanil 5 ug&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthesia will be standardized in all other aspects in all groups and basically include&#xD;
      propofol for induction, rocuronium as muscle relaxant, sevoflurane and remifentanil for pain&#xD;
      management and betamethasone + ondansetron as prophylaxis against post-operative nausea or&#xD;
      vomiting (PONV). Surgery will also be standardized in all patients and follow the routines&#xD;
      already established in the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of surgery, patients will be transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU)&#xD;
      where they will remain for 4 h observation and subsequently transferred to the general&#xD;
      surgical wards for observation and discharge home. All measurement times will be taken from&#xD;
      the end of surgery, which will be considered as t = 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following parameters will be recorded:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Total morphine consumption during 0-4, 4-home discharge and analgesic supplements after&#xD;
           home discharge and up to 1 week will be recorded. Time to first morphine administration&#xD;
           after surgery will be registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Blood tests for measurement of cortisol, glucose, insulin, creatinine, NTproBNP and&#xD;
           hsTnT will be taken at fixed time points before and after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Pain intensity will be registered using NRS after 1, 2, 3, 4 and every 4 h until home&#xD;
           discharge, and thereafter every 24 h for 1 week.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. All side effects (PONV, pruritus, respiratory depression, oxygen saturation and need for&#xD;
           supplementary oxygen) and complications (bleeding, reoperation, pneumothorax etc.) will&#xD;
           be recorded. Postoperative delirium will be assessed 0-2 h postoperatively. Prolonged&#xD;
           PACU stay or re-admission to PACU will be registered. Clavien-Dindo classification for&#xD;
           grade of complication will be registered as also Postoperative Morbidity score (POMS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Respiratory function will be recorded in the following ways: blood gas (after 1 and 4&#xD;
           h), saturation, spirometry, maximum expiratory pressure preoperatively and after 4 h.&#xD;
           Need for supplementary oxygen to maintain SpO2 &gt; 93% will be registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Time to mobilization, time to discharge to the general ward (from PACU), &quot;home&#xD;
           readiness&quot; (primary endpoint) and home discharge will be registered in accordance with&#xD;
           standardized criteria. Criteria for home readiness: normal vital signs, pain intensity &lt;&#xD;
           4 (NRS 0-10), minimal or no postoperative nausea or vomiting, able to sit, walk and go&#xD;
           unhindered, no surgical complication (bleeding, fever), fully awake and able to follow&#xD;
           instructions (normal cognition), normally functioning urinary catheter and an adult at&#xD;
           home during the first 24 h after discharge home).&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Quality of Recovery 15 (QoR 24) will be measured before home-discharge and after 24 h&#xD;
           using a standardized questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Quality of life will be measured preoperatively and after 7 and 30 days using the&#xD;
           questionnaire EQ5D and WHODAS.&#xD;
