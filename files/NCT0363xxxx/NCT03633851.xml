    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to compare the astigmatism reducing effect of a toric intraocular&#xD;
      lens (IOL) (model MX60T - Bausch &amp; Lomb) with that of limbal relaxing incisional surgery&#xD;
      combined with a non toric IOL (model MX60 - Bausch &amp; Lomb) in patients with corneal&#xD;
      astigmatism between 1.0 and 1.5 diopters and also the effect of cylinder reduction on&#xD;
      patient's quality of vision.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised controlled trial with intra-patient comparison (bilateral study) in&#xD;
      which study patients will be randomized by a medical statistician to the implantation of the&#xD;
      toric intraocular lens (IOL) (model MX60T, Bausch &amp; Lomb) in one eye and the non-toric IOL&#xD;
      model MX60 plus LRI in the fellow eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During pre-operative examination, the patient will undergo:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An ophthalmic examination including slit lamp biomicroscopy and retinal examination;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Uncorrected and best-corrected visual acuity (UCVA and BCVA): monocular and binocular;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Optical biometry with IOLMaster (Carl Zeiss Meditec);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Orbscan corneal topography (Bausch and Lomb Orbscan IIz Corneal Analysis System);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of Vision (QoV) questionnaire score). It is a validated, Rasch-adjusted&#xD;
           questionnaire in which patients are asked to rate 10 dysphotopsia items illustrated by&#xD;
           standard photographs, scoring each item (0, 1, 2, 3) in relation to how frequent,&#xD;
           severe, and bothersome their symptoms are (30 items in total).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Catquest 9-SF cataract visual disability questionnaire. It is a Rasch-adjusted cataract&#xD;
           visual disability questionnaire that asks patients to rate difficulty with a range of&#xD;
           vision-related daily activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The appropriate cylinder power of the MX60T toric-IOL as well of its axis of implantation&#xD;
      will be calculated with the calculator provided by the manufacturer Bausch + Lomb&#xD;
      (https://trulign.toriccalculator.com).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequently, the patient will undergo cataract surgery with IOL implantation under local&#xD;
      anaesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The temporal self-sealing incision, injection of viscoelastic substance, capsulorhexis,&#xD;
      phacoemulsification, irrigation/aspiration of cortical material and injection of viscoelastic&#xD;
      substance into the capsular bag will be performed as standard procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to randomisation, each patient will receive the implantation of the MX60T toric-IOL&#xD;
      in one eye and the MX60 non-toric IOL combined with limbal relaxing incisions (LRI) in the&#xD;
      fellow eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The eye that will receive the toric-IOL will have the horizontal meridian marked&#xD;
      preoperatively at the limbus in the sitting position with a blue marking pen and insulin&#xD;
      syringe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IOL will be implanted via injector into the capsular bag using the manufacturers'&#xD;
      recommended IOL loading and injection technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The toric-IOL will be rotated in the capsular bag so that the axis markers on the IOL will be&#xD;
      aligned to the limbal markings (planned axis). Then, the viscoelastic substance will be&#xD;
      aspirated thoroughly from the eye. Final refinement of axis position of the IOL will be&#xD;
      undertaken after removal of viscoelastic material from the capsular bag to ensure that&#xD;
      irrigation/aspiration of viscoelastic does not move the lens off axis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fellow eye will receive a temporal or an on-axis incision with limbal relaxing incision&#xD;
      with a 600Âµm single-use steel blade combined with the MX60 non-toric IOL&#xD;
      (http://www.lricalculator.com).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interval between the first and second eye surgery will be recorded. The location and&#xD;
      length of the LRIs will be made after calculation according to the Donnenfeld nomogram&#xD;
      (www.lricalculator.com).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After one hour postoperatively, a photo of the toric-IOL in retroillumination will be taken&#xD;
      to evaluate if IOL is on axis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At six months and twelve months after the surgery performed in the second eye, patients will&#xD;
      undergo assessement of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  autorefraction;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  unaided and best-spectacle corrected visual acuity (monocular and binocular),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  optical biometry;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  corneal topography;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  photo of the toric-IOL in retroillumination (to evaluate if IOL is on axis);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Catquest 9-SF cataract visual disability questionnaire;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of Vision (QoV) questionnaire score;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Overall satisfaction with vision rating questionnaire (only at 6 months and 12 months).&#xD;
           It will be obtained by asking patients to rate whether they were very satisfied,&#xD;
           satisfied, neither satisfied nor unsatisfied, unsatisfied, or very unsatisfied.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dysphotopsia questionnaire. They are 4 questions regarding dysphotopsia symptoms: &quot;Since&#xD;
           your surgery, have you noticed any&quot; halo, glare or dazzle, unwanted images, or shadows?&#xD;
           Patients were asked to respond by indicating whether they had not experienced these&#xD;
           symptoms at all (&quot;none&quot;) or found them &quot;barely noticeable,&quot; &quot;annoying,&quot; or&#xD;
           &quot;debilitating.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be performed using SPSS for Macintosh software (version 20.0,&#xD;
      International Business Machines Corp.). Normality distribution will be tested with the&#xD;
      Shapiro-Wilk test; data will be considered normal if the p value is less than 0.05. The&#xD;
      central tendency and statistical dispersion of each parameter will be recorded as the mean&#xD;
      and standard deviation (SD) for normal data and as the median and interquartile difference&#xD;
      for nonparametric data. The coordinates of keratometric cylinders and the centroids will be&#xD;
      calculated according to the Alpins method. Double-angle polar plots will be used to display&#xD;
      the astigmatism analysis (Excel 2011 for Macintosh, Microsoft Corp.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Student t test for paired samples and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test will be used for&#xD;
      normal and nonparametric data, respectively, to compare the 2 related samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A statistically significant difference will be defined as a p value less than 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any adverse event will be recorded.&#xD;
