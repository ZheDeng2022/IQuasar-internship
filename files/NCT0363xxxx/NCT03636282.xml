  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hockey Fans in Training (Hockey FIT) is a 12-month (3-month active phase and 9-month&#xD;
      minimally-supported phase) weight loss and healthy lifestyle program for middle-aged,&#xD;
      overweight/obese male hockey fans, delivered by trained coaches in collaboration with major&#xD;
      junior or professional hockey teams and implementation partners (e.g., YMCAs, local fitness&#xD;
      facilities, and universities) in Canada.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the proposed study, a minimum of 32 sites (affiliated with hockey teams and local&#xD;
      implementation partners) will be randomly assigned to either immediate delivery (Hockey FIT&#xD;
      program) or delayed delivery (wait-list control). At each site, male hockey fans at risk for&#xD;
      chronic diseases will be recruited to take part in the study (note: the goal is to recruit&#xD;
      approximately 40 men/site). Sites assigned to the delayed delivery group will offer the&#xD;
      Hockey FIT program to their enrolled participants after 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through the Hockey FIT program, the investigators aim to promote weight loss, increase&#xD;
      physical activity levels, and improve other health measures through a cost-effective solution&#xD;
      that is acceptable and appealing to men who are overweight or obese.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this study is to reduce preventable chronic diseases in Canadian men by&#xD;
      improving health behaviours and health indicators. To achieve this goal, following a&#xD;
      successful pilot study providing strong evidence to proceed with a definitive trial, the&#xD;
      investigators are conducting a pragmatic, cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the&#xD;
      Hockey FIT program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary specific aim is to conduct an outcome evaluation to evaluate the effectiveness of&#xD;
      Hockey FIT in middle-aged Canadian men who are overweight or obese. Specifically, the&#xD;
      investigators will: examine whether Hockey FIT (vs. wait-list control) leads to: greater&#xD;
      weight loss at 12 months (primary outcome), as well as improved health behaviours (physical&#xD;
      activity; sedentary time; eating habits) and health indicators (physiological measures;&#xD;
      health &amp; psychosocial measures) at 3 and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the pilot study, the investigators will use the affiliation of being a fan of&#xD;
      hockey as a powerful draw to engage men. Sites will be selected based on availability of both&#xD;
      a major junior (or professional) hockey team and an implementation partner (e.g., YMCA&#xD;
      branch, fitness facility, University) located in the city. A minimum of 32 Canadian sites&#xD;
      will be randomized to the intervention (Hockey FIT program: immediately delivery) or&#xD;
      comparator (wait-list control: delayed delivery); at each site, men will be recruited to&#xD;
      participate (with the goal of recruiting approximately 40 men/site). Intervention sites will&#xD;
      begin Hockey FIT immediately while comparator sites will offer Hockey FIT after a 12-month&#xD;
      delay. The measurement sessions involving both groups will take place at 0 (baseline), 3 and&#xD;
      12 months.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Trained assessors conducting measurements are not blinded to study allocation in all instances. When a trained assessor is not blinded, potential bias related to measurement of the primary outcome (weight) is being addressed by the requirement of photos of weight (measured via an electronic scale) being taken alongside the study measurement form (including study ID), at all follow-up time points. Furthermore, a study team member will verify that all weights recorded on the study measurement form match what is shown in the photo.</masking_description>
