    <measure>Overall Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>ORR is defined as the percentage of participants with a best confirmed response of Complete Response (CR: disappearance of all target lesions) or Partial Response (PR: ≥30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) as determined by the investigator using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the interval from the start of study treatment until the earlier of the first documentation of disease progression determined by RECIST 1.1 or death from any cause.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response (DOR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>DOR is defined as the interval from the first documentation of response, as determined by RECIST 1.1, to the earlier of the first documentation of disease progression or death from any cause, and calculated for participants with a best confirmed response of CR (disappearance of all target lesions) or PR (≥30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Response (TTR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>TTR is defined as the interval from the start of study treatment to the first documentation of a response, as determined by RECIST 1.1, and calculated for participants with a best confirmed response of CR or PR.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of participants experiencing an Adverse Event (AE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant regardless of its causal relationship to study treatment. An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of the study drug, whether or not it is considered to be study drug related. Included in this definition are any newly occurring events and any previous condition that has increased in severity or frequency since the administration of study drug.</description>
