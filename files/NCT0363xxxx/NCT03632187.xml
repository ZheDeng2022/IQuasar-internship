  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polymyalgia rheumatic (PMR) is a frequent inflammatory disease. It affects the elderly, with&#xD;
      peak incidences at the age of 70 to 80 years; an age &gt;50 years or older, is considered a&#xD;
      criterion for the diagnosis. Polymyalgia rheumatica occurs at a frequency that is 3 to 10&#xD;
      times that of giant-cell arteritis. Disease risk varies according to race and geographic&#xD;
      region. The incidence is highest among whites in northern European populations (about 20&#xD;
      cases per 100,000 persons older than 50 years of age); it is lower in southern European&#xD;
      populations (about 10 cases per 100,000).The diagnosis is based on established ACR/EULAR&#xD;
      classification criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long term low-dose glucocorticoid (GCs) (prednisone or prednisolone started at 15 to 20&#xD;
      mg/day progressively tapered) is the mainstay of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The activity of PMR is evaluated using the PMR-AS, a disease activity score based on morning&#xD;
      stiffness, ability to elevate the upper limbs, physician's global disease assessment and pain&#xD;
      assessment measured by the patient using VAS, and the C-reactive protein (CRP) level. The&#xD;
      PMR-AS is considered as relevant to define relapse and remission but also to decide if&#xD;
      treatment have to be decreased, unchanged or increased (PMR-AS &lt; 10: decrease, PMR-AS &gt; 17&#xD;
      increase to previous dosage, 10 ≤ PMR-AS ≤ 17: stable dose)..&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comorbidity in PMR are due to GCs and 30% of the patients underwent a relapse when tapering&#xD;
      GCs. If the investigators able to start prednisone at a lower dosage (i.e. 8 mg then tapered&#xD;
      for 3 to 4 months), the cumulative dosage of steroid would not have major side effects but it&#xD;
      is not possible without new therapeutic agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TENOR study (Tolerance and Efficacy of tocilizumab iN pOlymyalgia Rheumatica), a phase 2&#xD;
      study, demonstrated efficacy of tocilizumab as first line treatment in PMR without GCs and&#xD;
      its ability to spare GCs. This was the first study demonstrating that a biologic may improve&#xD;
      PMR without steroid, and that also showed that a short treatment by biologic followed by a&#xD;
      low dose GCs therapy may be a new concept in the treatment of PMR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Molecular studies in GCA and PMR suggest that dendritic cells initiate the pathogenic cascade&#xD;
      and recruit T cells. Two major immune-response networks have been identified related to type&#xD;
      1 helper T-cell (Th1) and to helper T-cell (Th17). Abatacept is comprised of the&#xD;
      ligand-binding domain of CTLA4 plus modified Fc domain derived from IgG1. By containing&#xD;
      CTLA4, abatacept blocks the engagement of CD28 with its ligand, thereby inhibiting T cell&#xD;
      activation. It has recently demonstrated its efficacy in Granulomatosis with polyangiitis&#xD;
      (GPA) but also in giant cell arteritis (GCA). Due to its good safety profile in rheumatoid&#xD;
      arthritis and its potential to modulate T cell activation and derived cytokines, abatacept is&#xD;
      an attractive agent to investigate in patients with PMR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this randomized prospective placebo controlled study, the objective is to demonstrate the&#xD;
      ability of abatacept to improve alone PMR and then to allow a steroid sparing effect after&#xD;
      this induction treatment, in early onset PMR.&#xD;
