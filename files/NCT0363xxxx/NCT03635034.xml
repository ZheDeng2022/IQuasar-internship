  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inserting a Bladder catheter during catheter ablation is standard practice at most&#xD;
      Institutions. Unfortunately, bladder catheters are associated with adverse outcomes,&#xD;
      including catheter associated cystitis, hematuria, dysuria, and urethral damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator proposes a prospective, randomized clinical trial comparing group A that&#xD;
      will receive a catheter during the ablation procedure and group B that will not receive the&#xD;
      procedure. The Investigator hypothesizes the group receiving the bladder catheters will have&#xD;
      a higher rate of complications.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      (AF) is the commonest arrhythmia worldwide and accounts for significant morbidity. The&#xD;
      mainstay of treatment for drug refractory AF is catheter ablation. A preponderance of&#xD;
      evidence indicates better outcomes when this procedure is performed under general anesthesia;&#xD;
      this is standard of care at our institution. However, for a variety of reasons including long&#xD;
      procedure time, procedural intravenous fluid administration, and prolonged bedrest following&#xD;
      the procedure, standard of care at our institution and others is for bladder catheter&#xD;
      placement during the procedure (4). Unfortunately, bladder catheters used during cardiac&#xD;
      surgery have been associated with adverse outcomes, including catheter associated cystitis,&#xD;
      hematuria, dysuria, and urethral damage(&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fortunately, the landscape of AF ablation is changing rapidly, and procedure times are&#xD;
      rapidly decreasing. Improvements in three dimensional mapping technology has allowed for less&#xD;
      reliance on fluoroscopy and allows for real time visualization of ablation lesions.&#xD;
      Improvements in ablation catheters have allowed for significantly reduced intravenous fluid&#xD;
      administration during the procedure. The Site has also adopted an expedited protocol for&#xD;
      venous hemostasis following the procedure that involves a figure-of-eight groin stitch,&#xD;
      allowing for earlier mobility and a shorter bed rest following the procedure. Therefore, we&#xD;
      question the need for routine bladder catheter placement during AF ablation procedures&#xD;

    <description>Per patient reported outcomes, subjects will be asked if they experienced any of the following complications: cystitis, hematuria, dysuria, urethral damage and urinary retention. The primary composite outcome of cystitis, hematuria, dysuria, urethral damage or urinary retention will be compared using Chisq or Fisher's exact test. Additional bivariate correlates to the primary outcome will be analysed including age, gender, operator, procedure satisfaction score, procedure duration, procedural fluid administration, total hospital stay fluid administration, and baseline clinical variables. Variables with p value &lt;o.o5 on bivariate analysis will be included in a multivariate regression model.</description>
