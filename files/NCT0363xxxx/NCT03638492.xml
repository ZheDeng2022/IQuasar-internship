      Objectives: The purpose of this study was to assess the long-term follow-up of the overall&#xD;
      and melanoma-specific survival in the randomised, open-lable multicenter trial (NTC&#xD;
      NCT01183936) comparing excision margin of 2 cm versus 4 cm for patients with primary&#xD;
      cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM) thicker than 2 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study hypothesis: The hypothesis is that there is no difference between the two treatment&#xD;
      arms measured as melanoma-specific survival and overall survival.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Historically, CMMs have been excised with wide resection margins of 5-cm or more with the&#xD;
      radical removal of lymph nodes. This treatment emerged from a recommendation from Handley in&#xD;
      1907 based on a single pathological specimen. This &quot;radical&quot; surgical management resulted in&#xD;
      bad cosmetic results, lymphedema, long hospital inpatient stay, frequent skin grafting and/or&#xD;
      complicated skin flap reconstructions. Not until some 60-plus years later did questions arise&#xD;
      in clinical practices whether the need for this extensive surgery was mandated and clinical&#xD;
      practice was not substantially changed until the late 1980's. Retrospective studies published&#xD;
      in the 1980s suggested that narrower excision margins may be appropriate for treatment of&#xD;
      some CMMs, especially thinner lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nowadays, the recommendations for surgical treatment are based on the Breslow thickness of&#xD;
      the CMM, since it is considered the most important prognostic indicator of localized disease&#xD;
      and is therefore the information upon which today's surgical strategies are founded. However,&#xD;
      recommendations vary over the world, especially for thicker tumors which is clearly presented&#xD;
      by Ethun et al. (2016). For CMM of ≤ 1 mm thickness most centers use a 1 cm margin, but for&#xD;
      tumors 1.01 - 4 mm the margins of resection are 1-3 cm depending on the country. Most&#xD;
      patients with primary CMM &gt; 4 mm are operated on with a margin of 2-cm today. The different&#xD;
      national guidelines are thus, somewhat confusing and in a report from 2004 Thomas JM et al.&#xD;
      showed that a 1-cm margin for CMM with a poor prognosis (≥2 mm) is associated with a greater&#xD;
      risk of regional recurrence than in a 3-cm margin, but with a similar survival rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Today, according to Sladden et al. (2018), there have been published six randomized&#xD;
      controlled trials (RCTs) assessing outcomes for surgical excision margins based upon Breslow&#xD;
      thickness of invasive tumors. Three out of those six RCTs have included patients with CMMs&#xD;
      2-4 cm thick. Still, there are controversies and this report points out gaps of knowledge,&#xD;
      e.g. lack of evidence about the optimal depth of excision and the optimal and minimal&#xD;
      excision margins, since 1-cm versus 2-cm resection margins of invasive CMMs have not been&#xD;
      directly compared yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interestingly, out of one of the three RCTs analyzing melanomas with 2-4 mm thickness,&#xD;
      long-term follow up data has recently been published by Hayes et al. 2016. They report an&#xD;
      extended follow-up with a median follow-up of almost 9 years, concluding that 1-cm margin is&#xD;
      not safe for high-risk CMMs compared to 3-cm margin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From this point, based up on those interesting results, the investigators now present&#xD;
      long-term follow-up of survival in patients included in the RCT published 2011 by Gillgren et&#xD;
      al.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The original trial by Gillgren et al. 2011, is a randomized multicenter trial, launched from&#xD;
      the Swedish Melanoma Study Group and the Danish Melanoma Group in 1992, included 936 patients&#xD;
      from January 22 1992 to May 19 2004. Patients were recruited from Sweden (6 centers with 644&#xD;
      pat), Denmark (180 pat), Estonia (80 pat) and Norway (32 pat). Randomization routines were&#xD;
      set up by the steering committee and eligible patients were randomized locally by telephone&#xD;
      calls to national and international cancer centers (upon a histologically proven diagnoses&#xD;
      and signed patient consent form). Only patients with a CMM &gt;2 mm and with localized disease&#xD;
      (who fulfilled the in- and exclusion criteria) were eligible for study inclusion. Patients&#xD;
      with CMM on the hands, feet, head-neck and ano-genital region were excluded. Final surgery&#xD;
      must had been planned within 8 weeks after date of diagnosis. All analyses were conducted&#xD;
      according to the intention-to-treat principle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were followed clinically every 3 months for 2 years and thereafter every 6 months up&#xD;
      to 5 years, with a median follow-up of 6.7 years. Follow-up data was thus collected from&#xD;
      cancer registries, cause of death registries and medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses were made by Kaplan Meier life-table curves. Prognostic factors were&#xD;
      assessed with the use of a uni- and multivariate Cox regression analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the original study, the primary melanomas were removed either by an excisional biopsy&#xD;
      (margin of 1-3 mm) or with a 2-cm margin before randomization. Patients were randomly&#xD;
      assigned (1:1) to either a 2-cm surgical excision margin or a 4-cm surgical excision margin.&#xD;
      The physician enrolled the patients after histological confirmation of melanomas &gt;2 mm.&#xD;
      Patients who had a diagnostic initial excision were randomized to the 2-cm group or to an&#xD;
      additional wide local excision with a margin of up to either 2 cm or 4 cm. Patients who had a&#xD;
      2 cm initial excision were allocated to either no further surgery and randomized to the 2-cm&#xD;
      group. Radical surgery was to be performed within 8 weeks after the date of diagnosis. The&#xD;
      method of surgery was to extend to, or include, the deep fascia. Pathological excision&#xD;
      margins were not registered. The sentinel node biopsy technique was introduced in the end of&#xD;
      the enrolment period and was allocated to the same follow-up as the other patients. There&#xD;
      were no protocol violations since the sentinel node biopsies were all in clinical stage IIA-C&#xD;
      preoperatively. The patients were followed by standard clinical routines within participating&#xD;
      centers at that time every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months until 5 years. Data&#xD;
      on clinical relapse were obtained at the follow-up visits. Outcome data were also assessed&#xD;
      from regional cancer registries, the national cause-of-death registries, and medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the long-term follow-up study, each country collected date of death, primary cause of&#xD;
      death and underlying cause of death from central registries. The entire cohort was&#xD;
      followed-up until Dec 31, 2016.&#xD;
