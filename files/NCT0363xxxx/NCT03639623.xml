      This is a phase 2A, single center, open-label, single-arm, 24-week study to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety, tolerability and efficacy of Saroglitazar Magnesium 4 mg in liver transplant&#xD;
      recipients with NAFLD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted over a period of up to 33 weeks and will include 5 weeks&#xD;
      screening, a 24 week treatment period and 4 week follow-up period. The primary end point of&#xD;
      the study is to assess the safety of Saroglitazar Magnesium 4 mg in liver transplant&#xD;
      recipients with NAFLD over 24 weeks of treatment.&#xD;
