    <textblock>
      Phase III randomized, 2 x 2 design, open label, multi-center study that will assess the&#xD;
      removal of filter ventilation on smoking behavior and biomarkers in a tobacco and nicotine&#xD;
      product marketplace simulation of a real world environment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, open label, controlled multi-site study will simulate a &quot;real world&quot; tobacco&#xD;
      environment by providing access to an experimental marketplace where they will be given&#xD;
      vouchers that can be exchanged for assigned study cigarettes (either ventilated or&#xD;
      unventilated) and two of the groups will also have access to non-combusted tobacco/nicotine&#xD;
      products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects (N=550; N=125 in each group) will be randomly assigned to: 1) Ventilated cigarettes&#xD;
      only; or 2) Unventilated cigarettes only; 3) Ventilated cigarettes + alternative nicotine&#xD;
      delivery systems (ANDS); 4) Unventilated cigarettes + ANDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Smokers will undergo an in person screening and then a 12 week experimental trial consisting&#xD;
      of 2 weeks of baseline; 2 weeks of usual brand cigarettes in the marketplace and 8 weeks on&#xD;
      the study cigarettes in the marketplace, plus a follow-up visit 4 weeks after the&#xD;
      intervention is over. The experimental period will simulate a &quot;real world&quot; environment by&#xD;
      providing participants with vouchers for a specified number of points that can be exchanged&#xD;
      for study cigarettes and/or ANDS. At the end of the study they can exchange unspent points&#xD;
      for money.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biomarker samples (total nicotine equivalents, tobacco specific nitrosamines, volatile&#xD;
      organic compound and inflammation markers), smoking topography and inhalation measures are&#xD;
      taken at baseline and end of trial.&#xD;
