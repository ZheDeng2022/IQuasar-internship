  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is the most common autoimmune bullous dermatosis. It mainly affects&#xD;
      the elderly, and its cutaneous manifestations are extremely varied. Since the publication of&#xD;
      the first case of PB associated with sulfasalazine in 1970, several drugs have been reported&#xD;
      for their potential link with the development of PB. Recently, cases of PB associated with&#xD;
      dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP4) inhibitors, also known as gliptins, have been reported. DPP4&#xD;
      inhibitors are oral antidiabetic agents prescribed to patients with type 2 diabetes, as&#xD;
      monotherapy, in combination with other oral antidiabetic agents or with insulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, an increasing number of cases have been published, describing the potential&#xD;
      role of gliptins in PB induction. All these clinical cases and pharmacovigilance analyzes&#xD;
      tend to show an increased risk of developing BP in case of gliptin exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to evaluate the risk of developing a PB under DPP4 inhibitor treatment,&#xD;
      comparing cases of diabetic patients with BP, to matched diabetic controls for sex and age,&#xD;
      from French departments. Endocrinology in a retrospective study from 1 January 2014 to 31&#xD;
      July 2016.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted using databases of clinical and histological records. The&#xD;
      investigators will perform a retrospective 1: 2 case-control study comparing cases with type&#xD;
      2 diabetes and BP to matched diabetic controls for sex and age, randomly drawn from French&#xD;
      endocrinology departments (Marseille La Conception ) and Switzerland (Bern), between January&#xD;
      1, 2014 and July 31, 2016. the investigators will compare gliptin exposure in the&#xD;
      case-control group versus the control group, adjusting for potential confounding bias using&#xD;
      models. logistic regression.&#xD;

      Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is the most common autoimmune bullous dermatosis. It mainly affects&#xD;
      the elderly, and its cutaneous manifestations are extremely varied. Since the publication of&#xD;
      the first case of PB associated with sulfasalazine in 1970, several drugs (spironolactone,&#xD;
      furosemide, chloroquine, beta-blockers and various antibiotics) have been reported for their&#xD;
      potential link with the development of PB. Recently, cases of PB associated with dipeptidyl&#xD;
      peptidase-IV (DPP4) inhibitors, also known as gliptins, have been reported. DPP4 inhibitors&#xD;
      are oral antidiabetic agents prescribed to patients with type 2 diabetes, as monotherapy, in&#xD;
      combination with other oral antidiabetic agents or with insulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Problem raised:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, an increasing number of cases have been published, describing the potential&#xD;
      role of gliptins in PB induction. All these clinical cases and pharmacovigilance analyzes&#xD;
      tend to show an increased risk of developing BP in case of gliptin exposure, but this&#xD;
      hypothesis has not yet been confirmed by a quality controlled study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goal:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to evaluate the risk of developing a PB under DPP4 inhibitor treatment,&#xD;
      comparing cases of diabetic patients with BP, to matched diabetic controls for sex and age,&#xD;
      from French departments. Endocrinology (Marseille La Conception) and Dermatologie (Marseille&#xD;
      North, Marseille La Timone) and Swiss (Bern), in a retrospective study from 1 January 2014 to&#xD;
      31 July 2016.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in three university departments of Dermatology (Marseille North,&#xD;
      Marseille La Timone, Bern), using databases of clinical and histological records. The&#xD;
      investigators will perform a retrospective 1: 2 case-control study comparing cases with type&#xD;
      2 diabetes and BP to matched diabetic controls for sex and age, randomly drawn from French&#xD;
      endocrinology departments (Marseille La Conception ) and Switzerland (Bern), between January&#xD;
      1, 2014 and July 31, 2016. The investigators will compare gliptin exposure in the&#xD;
      case-control group versus the control group, adjusting for potential confounding bias using&#xD;
      models. logistic regression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for inclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Case: Patients from three university departments of Dermatology (Marseille North,&#xD;
           Marseille La Timone, Bern) with type 2 diabetes, and a diagnosis of PB diagnosed for the&#xD;
           first time between January 1, 2014 and July 31, 2016. The diagnosis of PB is based on&#xD;
           compatible clinical presentation, compatible histology, positive direct&#xD;
           immunofluorescence (IFD), and in some cases positive indirect immunofluorescence (IFI)&#xD;
           and / or the presence of autoantibodies (BP180 and / or BP230) by ELISA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Witnesses: Patients from two university departments of Endocrinology (Marseille La&#xD;
           Conception and Bern) with type 2 diabetes, and matched 1: 2 to cases for sex and age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Case: Patients with another bullous dermatosis, not meeting the inclusion criteria.&#xD;
           Patients biopsied before consultation in University Hospital, or patients seen in&#xD;
           private dermatology practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Witnesses: Patients suffering at the time of inclusion of a chronic dermatosis, in&#xD;
           particular of a bullous dermatosis.&#xD;
