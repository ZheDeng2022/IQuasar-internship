  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gemcitabine plus cisplatin (GC) is more effective than fluorouracil plus cisplatin in the&#xD;
      treatment of recurrent or metastatic NPC (R/M-NPC). GC is the standard first-line&#xD;
      chemotherapy regimen for this population. However, the median progression-free survival was&#xD;
      only 7 months for GC regimen. Anlotinib is a kinase inhibitor of receptor tyrosine with&#xD;
      multi-targets, especially for VEGFR2、VEGFR3、PDGFRβ and c-Kit, which has strong effect of&#xD;
      anti-angiogenesis. This study is aim to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination&#xD;
      regimen of anlotinib plus GC as first-line treatment for R/M-NPC.&#xD;

      In the phase Ib portion, an escalated dose cohort is recruited to determine the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of anlotinib when given in&#xD;
      combination with gemcitabine/cisplatin. The phase II portion is designed to characterize the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of the combination therapy in previous untreated patients with R/M-NPC.&#xD;

    <description>In the phase Ib portion, patients received dose escalation of anlotinb (from 8mg to 12mg orally once daily on days 1-14 of a 21-day) in combination with fixed dose of gemcitabine (1000mg/m2 intravenously on days 1 and 8) and cisplatin (80mg/m2 intravenously on day 1) every 3 weeks.&#xD;
In the phase II portion, patients received anlotinb at recommended phase II dose determined in the phase Ib portion, in combination with fixed dose of gemcitabine and cisplatin every 3 weeks.&#xD;
The combination of anlotinib plus gemcitabine / cisplatin was repeated every 3 weeks for up to six cycles.
