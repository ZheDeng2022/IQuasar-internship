      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a pathologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the biliary tract&#xD;
             (intra-hepatic, extra-hepatic (hilar, distal) or gall bladder) that is not eligible&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients must have received 1st line platinum-based systemic chemotherapy for advanced&#xD;
             BTC for 4-6 months without radiologic or clinical progression. Last systemic infusion&#xD;
             of 1st line platinum-based therapy may not be more than 4 weeks from study informed&#xD;
             consent. Prior peri-operative chemotherapy is permitted provided it was completed &gt; 6&#xD;
             months from start of platinum-based therapy for advanced disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior surgical resection, radiation, chemoembolization, radioembolization or other&#xD;
             local ablative therapies are permitted if completed &gt; 4 weeks prior to enrollment AND&#xD;
             if patient has recovered to &lt; 1 grade 1 toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have measurable disease (as per RECISTv1.1) in at least one site not&#xD;
             previously treated with radiation or liver directed therapy (including bland, chemo-&#xD;
             or radio-embolization, or ablation) either within the liver or in a metastatic site&#xD;
             unless the patient has had complete response to 1st line platinum-based therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age≥18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Child-Pugh score of A or B7 (Scoring system used to assess the prognosis of chronic&#xD;
             liver disease, mainly cirrhosis)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status of 0-1 (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group scoring system used&#xD;
             to quantify general well-being and activities of daily life; scores range from 0 to 5&#xD;
             where 0 represents perfect health and 5 represents death.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and willingness to sign IRB-approved informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Available archived tissue (FFPE block or 20 unstained slides from prior core biopsy or&#xD;

             study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding since rucaparib and/or nivolumab may harm the fetus or&#xD;
             child. All females of childbearing potential (not surgically sterilized and between&#xD;

             months (for men) following completion of study therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with an active, known or suspected autoimmune disease which may affect&#xD;
             vital organ function, or has/may require systemic immunosuppressive therapy for&#xD;
             management. Participants with type I diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism only requiring&#xD;
             hormone replacement, skin disorders (such as vitiligo, psoriasis, or alopecia) not&#xD;

             external trigger are permitted to enroll.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids&#xD;
             (&gt;10 mg daily prednisone equivalent) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14&#xD;
             days of start of study treatment. Inhaled or topical steroids, and adrenal replacement&#xD;
             steroid doses &gt;10 mg daily prednisone equivalent, are permitted in the absence of&#xD;
             active autoimmune disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
