  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to try to understand and explain why HIV-infected and uninfected&#xD;
      women who use cannabis (marijuana) currently, or have used cannabis in the past, have higher&#xD;
      risk of having experienced a fall in our earlier analyses in WIHS. This study will compare&#xD;
      what happens when women are given cannabis compared with placebo, on measures of mobility,&#xD;
      including walking speed under walking conditions that vary in terms of difficulty; for&#xD;
      example normal walking and walking while reciting alternate letters of the alphabet, as well&#xD;
      as measures of balance and cognition (for example attention, memory).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Cannabis is the most prevalent drug used by adults aged 50 and older in the U.S., after&#xD;
      alcohol and tobacco. Recent trends show dramatic increases in cannabis use among older U.S.&#xD;
      adults, and rising cannabis tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) content. Cannabis intoxication acutely&#xD;
      alters short-term memory, attention span, verbal fluency, reaction time, and psychomotor&#xD;
      control. Heavy long term cannabis use has been associated with lasting impairments in verbal&#xD;
      learning, memory, and attention that correlate with duration of use; however, other studies&#xD;
      have found that cognitive deficits from cannabis are reversible and related to recent&#xD;
      exposure. But studies on cannabis exposure and cognition are age limited by including only&#xD;
      adolescents through middle-aged adults; effects of acute and long-term cannabis use on&#xD;
      cognition among older adults are virtually unknown. Given the rising potency and increasing&#xD;
      frequency of cannabis use among older adults, studies systematically examining the risks and&#xD;
      benefits of cannabis use in older adults are urgently needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cannabis use is particularly common in people living with HIV (PLWH), with 12- 56% prevalence&#xD;
      rates compared to 9.5% in the general U.S. population. HIV has detrimental effects on both&#xD;
      mobility and cognition, and similar to normal aging, mobility in patients with HIV may be&#xD;
      influenced by cognitive function. Mild-to-moderate neurocognitive impairments (NCI), notably&#xD;
      in attention and executive functions, remain highly prevalent and persist despite suppressive&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy, affecting almost half of PLWH. Little is known about the combined&#xD;
      effects of cannabis use and HIV infection on cognition and mobility, particularly among older&#xD;
      individuals. As the population of older PLWH continues to grow, co-occurring aging and HIV&#xD;
      related declines in cognition and mobility will coincide; the effects of continued cannabis&#xD;
      use In the Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS), it was found that current cannabis use was&#xD;
      associated with over double the odds of single fall, and over 2.5 times the odds of multiple&#xD;
      falls in 6 months; past cannabis use was associated with over 1.5 greater odds of single fall&#xD;
      and multiple falls. Preliminary data shows that 40% of WIHS women (mean age 48) reported at&#xD;
      least one fall over 2 years; current cannabis users had 1.7 times greater fall risk among&#xD;
      HIV+ but not HIV-women. The hypothesis is that falls are related to acute effects of cannabis&#xD;
      on attention and mobility, and that given subtle, pre-existing deficits associated with HIV&#xD;
      infection, these acute cannabis effects may be more pronounced in HIV+ women, placing them at&#xD;
      increased risks of falls. Whether this observed fall risk associated with cannabis use&#xD;
      represents acute effects, or persistent effects of past cannabis use on cognition, balance,&#xD;
      or mobility, or whether adverse effects of cannabis differ by HIV status merits further study&#xD;
      in this aging population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot;Walking While Talking&quot; (WWT) test requires individuals to walk while performing a&#xD;
      secondary attention-demanding task (dual task), has been used to assess the interactions&#xD;
      between cognition and gait, and provides a framework for evaluating the effect of divided&#xD;
      attention, a facet of executive functions, on mobility. Increased dual task costs measured&#xD;
      using WWT may help unmask subtle and latent cognitive abnormalities before they become&#xD;
      clinically apparent by increasing the complexity of the walking condition, and predict falls,&#xD;
      frailty, disability, and mortality among older community-residing adults. Because both&#xD;
      cannabis use and HIV have been implicated in impairments in attention and executive&#xD;
      functions, the WWT may be a quick and simple mobility stress test to identify subtle&#xD;
      cognitive and motor effects of acute cannabis administration as a function of HIV status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective is to explore the mechanisms that underlie the increased fall risk associated&#xD;
      with cannabis use. The effects of controlled administration of active (7.0% THC) and inactive&#xD;
      (0.0%) cannabis in aging HIV+ women on stable HAART and HIV- controls enrolled on the WIHS&#xD;
      will be compared. Endpoints will be balance, mobility, and cognition, including a&#xD;
      cognitive-motor divided attention task (WWT). Specific aims and hypotheses are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the acute effects of cannabis on balance and mobility among older HIV+ and&#xD;
           HIV- women. These test will be performed within subject comparisons of performance on&#xD;
           balance and mobility tests at two supervised visits, with administration of placebo vs.&#xD;
           active cannabis in counter-balanced order. The hypothesis is that HIV+ women will have&#xD;
           greater impairment on balance and mobility, especially on complex walking conditions&#xD;
           that demand attention, with administration of active cannabis than HIV- women&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the acute effects of cannabis on cognition among older HIV+ and HIV-&#xD;
           women.HIV+ women will have greater impairment on cognitive testing, especially in&#xD;
           attention, with administration of active cannabis than HIV- women.&#xD;
