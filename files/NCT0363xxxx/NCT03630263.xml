  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Consumption of slowly digestible carbohydrates can elicit higher satiety feeling compared to&#xD;
      rapidly digestible carbohydrates, however not all individuals respond the same. The&#xD;
      physiological mechanism that accounts for the satiety effect and the lack of consistency&#xD;
      among subjects is not fully understood. The overall aim of this research is to determine if&#xD;
      consumption of slow digestible carbohydrates can induce non-responding subjects (i.e., with&#xD;
      rapid gastric emptying) to activate the ileal brake and delay rate of gastric emptying.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to understand how diet may affect carbohydrate digestion,&#xD;
      gastric emptying time and overall health. The investigators will be recruiting 32 volunteers&#xD;
      for this study. To be eligible for this study, you need to be between 18 and 50 years old,&#xD;
      have a normal Body Mass Index, have a normal fasting blood glucose level, be free of any&#xD;
      gastrointestinal diseases, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, be free of wheat allergens,&#xD;
      gluten intolerance or sensitivities, and allergy to millet, and not be pregnant or nursing.&#xD;
      If you have any questions about the criteria, please ask the person consenting you.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, participants will consume two test meals at different times to assess gastric&#xD;
      emptying times. Test meals will consist of either corn starch (30 g) or pregelatinized (DE-1&#xD;
      Maltodextrin) starch in applesauce (200 g) with xanthan gum (0.2 g) to equalize viscosity.&#xD;
      Ingredients will be mixed immediately before consumption. For assessment of gastric emptying&#xD;
      time, we will use a non-invasive 13C-labeled octanoic acid breath test. In our proposed&#xD;
      procedure, 13C octanoic acid will be added to test meals, and breath samples will be taken&#xD;
      before and after ingestion up to 4 hours. Breath samples will be collected every 15 minutes&#xD;
      for first 2 hours and every 30 minutes for the next 2 hours. Participants will breathe into&#xD;
      300 mL bags and their content will be evaluated for [13C] using a 13CO2 Urea Breath Analyzer&#xD;
      POCone (Otsuka Electronics Co, Ltd, Osaka, Japan) as measures of gastric emptying. We have&#xD;
      used the labeled substrate and breath collection methods in our lab under previously approved&#xD;
      IRB protocols at Purdue University (IRB Protocols #1102010450, #1104010761, #1209012595,&#xD;
      #1405014904, and #1502015807, #1611018484, #1706019377. In addition, before, during, and&#xD;
      after each session, subjects will also be asked to fill out a short questionnaire with&#xD;
      questions regarding your hunger and fullness at those times. Test meals will be prepared in&#xD;
      the university with trained personnel. All the ingredients will be purchased from approved&#xD;
      food manufacturers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During testing days participants will be required to stay in the laboratory. Testing day&#xD;
      sessions will last about 4 hours. The day prior testing, participants will be provided a&#xD;
      standard meal but are not required to stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For assessment of diet composition, three 24-hour dietary recalls will be used. Participants&#xD;
      will be called on three different days. During these sessions, participants will be asked to&#xD;
      recount quantity and types of foods consumed throughout the day, including two weekdays and&#xD;
      one weekend day, to form a comprehensive picture of their dietary habits. Dietary data will&#xD;
      be collected and stored using no personally identifiable information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the continuous effect of slowly digestible&#xD;
      carbohydrates consumption on gastric emptying and its potential health benefits.&#xD;
