      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      O-GlcNAcase (OGA) is a brain enzyme. It may play a role in brain disorders like Alzheimer s&#xD;
      disease. Researchers want to see if a new drug can be used with positron emission tomography&#xD;
      (PET) scans to show OGA better. Researchers want to learn more about how it acts in healthy&#xD;
      people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test if the new drug [18F]OGA-1 can measure its receptor. To determine whether the same&#xD;
      results occur when scanning a person twice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy adults age 18 and older who are already enrolled in a separate protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some participants will have 1 whole-body PET scan during one 4-hour visit to the clinic. Some&#xD;
      will have 2-3 brain scans (PET and MRI) over 2-3 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the PET scan, a needle will guide a thin plastic tube (IV catheter) into an arm vein. A&#xD;
      small amount of radioactive chemical will be injected through the catheter. The needle will&#xD;
      be removed. Only the catheter will be left in the vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another IV catheter may be placed to draw blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood pressure, heart rate, and breathing rate will be measured. Participants will have an&#xD;
      electrocardiogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will lie on a bed that slides in and out of the donut-shaped scanner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scan will last 2-3 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For brain PET scan, participants will wear a plastic mask to keep their head still.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, participants will lie on a table. The table slides&#xD;
      in and out of the MRI scanner. This is a metal cylinder in a strong magnetic field.&#xD;
      Participants will be in the scanner up to 1 hour.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tau, a microtubule associated protein, regulates axonal structure and function within neurons&#xD;
      of the brain. Neurofibrillary tangles contain hyper-phosphorylated, insoluble tau protein and&#xD;
      are a hallmark of Alzheimer s disease (AD) and other tauopathies. Hyperphosphorylation of tau&#xD;
      is required for its aggregation into tangles. One novel strategy to decrease the&#xD;
      phosphorylation of tau is to increase the number of sugar molecules attached to tau, with the&#xD;
      overly simple mechanism that the presence of the sugar molecules physically blocks&#xD;
      phosphorylation. In this case, the sugar molecule is N-acetyl-Beta-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc),&#xD;
      and increased glycosylation is achieved by inhibiting the enzyme (OGA) that removes these&#xD;
      residues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In collaboration with Eli Lilly, our laboratory recently developed (18F)OGA-1, a novel PET&#xD;
      ligand to image the hydrolase OGA (O-GlcNAcase). Initial PET scans in monkey demonstrated&#xD;
      that (18F)OGA-1 is a promising ligand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol is a first-in-human evaluation of (18F)OGA-1 and has four phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Phase 1: whole body imaging of one (1) subject with a low injection activity of&#xD;
           approximately 2 mCi to confirm that no organ has prominently high uptake of (18F)OGA-1;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Phase 2: kinetic brain imaging in ten (10) subjects with up to 5 mCi injection to&#xD;
           quantify OGA in brain relative to concurrent measurement of the parent radioligand in&#xD;
           arterial plasma and venous plasma;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Phase 3: if (18F)OGA-1 is successful in Phase 2 in the first couple of subjects, we will&#xD;
           estimate the radiation-absorbed doses by performing whole body imaging on a total of&#xD;
           eight (8) subjects, with 5 mCi injection;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Phase 4: test-retest analysis in twelve (12) subjects, of brain binding relative to&#xD;
           concurrent measurement of the parent radioligand in arterial plasma (5 mCi per scan) and&#xD;
           venous plasma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, a total of 9 for whole body imaging and 22 for brain imaging&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy adult female and male volunteers (n= 22, ages greater than or equal to 18) will&#xD;
      undergo brain imaging. An additional nine healthy volunteers will undergo whole body&#xD;
      dosimetry analysis, for a total of 31 healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For quantification of (18F)OGA-1, 22 healthy controls will undergo brain PET imaging using&#xD;
      [18F]OGA-1 an arterial line, and venous line. Of this group of 22 healthy controls having&#xD;
      brain PET imaging, twelve of them will have a test-retest scan. Nine additional subjects will&#xD;
      have a whole body PET scan for dosimetry. For dosimetry, no arterial line will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;TAB&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess quantitation of OGA with (18F)GA-1, we will primarily use two outcome measures,&#xD;
      namely the identifiability and time stability of distribution volume (VT) calculated with&#xD;
      compartmental modeling. In the test-retest study, we will calculate the retest variability.&#xD;
      We will assess whole-body biodistribution and dosimetry of (18F)OGA-1 by calculating doses to&#xD;
      organs and the effective dose to the body as a whole.&#xD;
