  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While adhesive tape is commonly used to secure endotracheal tubes (ETT) during general&#xD;
      anesthesia, its use is also associated with facial skin injuries. Although a variety of&#xD;
      adhesive tapes are used in clinical practice, few studies have investigated the likelihood of&#xD;
      adhesives in producing injury. The purpose of this randomized, controlled, non-inferiority&#xD;
      study was to compare the proportion of facial skin injury with Durapore™ vs. Hy-Tape®.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adhesive tapes are often used on the patient's face during general anesthesia. They are used&#xD;
      to fix the tracheal tube, nasopharyngeal temperature probe, nasogastric tube, and nerve&#xD;
      stimulator electrodes. An adhesive tape used in anesthesia needs to provide fast, secure&#xD;
      adhesion to prevent dislodgement of critical devices. The tape should be secure over time,&#xD;
      with changes over temperature, humidity, or exposure to fluids as occurring in the operating&#xD;
      room. However, the tape should be gentle enough that removal should not cause skin trauma to&#xD;
      the face. While the skin irritation is generally limited to mild erythema that resolves on&#xD;
      its own within a day or two of receiving anesthesia, the irritation may affect patient&#xD;
      satisfaction. Furthermore, serious injury, including full-thickness epidermal loss with&#xD;
      purpura has occurred at Tufts Medical Center with the use of 3MTM Durapore tape, requiring&#xD;
      several doctor visits in follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical adhesive related skin injuries are estimated to impact at least 1.5 million patients&#xD;
      annually in the US with significant costs per incident. (1) At Tufts Medical Center, a&#xD;
      variety of adhesive tapes are used to secure the endotracheal tube during anesthesia,&#xD;
      including 3MTM Durapore (acrylate- based tape) and the Hy-Tape® Pink tape (zink-based tape)&#xD;
      with no preference for one or the other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hy-Tape's zinc oxide-based adhesive is claimed to be soothing to delicate skin, and removes&#xD;
      with minimum trauma, thereby reducing the chance of skin tears and tape burns. It also has&#xD;
      the unique quality of providing maximum adhesion when it reaches body temperature, without&#xD;
      getting more aggressive or breaking down over time as acrylic-based adhesive tapes do.&#xD;
      However, there is no scientific evidence to support this claim.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to compare the proportion of skin erythema after general&#xD;
      anesthesia with the use of DuraporeTM vs. Hy-Tape®.&#xD;
