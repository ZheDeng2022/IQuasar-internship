      To confirm the safety and performance of the DynamX Sirolimus-eluting Coronary Bioadaptor&#xD;
      System (SECBS) in de novo native coronary artery lesions using clinical and imaging&#xD;
      endpoints. Clinical follow-up will be conducted in all patients at 30 days, 6 and 12 months.&#xD;
      Imaging follow-up will be conducted at 6 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The DynamX Sirolimus Study is a prospective, consecutive enrollment, single-arm study&#xD;
      designed to enroll up to 30 patients requiring treatment of up to two de novo lesions ≤ 24 mm&#xD;
      in length in vessels ≥ 2.5 mm and ≤ 3.5 mm in diameter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One or two designated target lesions, located in separate epicardial vessels (RCA, LCX or&#xD;
      LAD), and meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria may be treated with the DynamX SECBS.&#xD;
      Alternatively, one target lesion may be treated with the DynamX SECBS after successful,&#xD;
      uncomplicated treatment of a non-target lesion, located in a separate epicardial vessel, with&#xD;
      any commercially-available DES. Acceptable example: non-target RCA lesion and LAD target&#xD;
      lesion. Not acceptable example: LAD non-target lesion and 1st diagonal target lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary safety endpoint is Target Lesion Failure at 6 months. TLF is a composite endpoint&#xD;
      defined as cardiac death, target vessel MI, and clinically-indicated target lesion&#xD;
      revascularization The primary efficacy endpoint is late lumen loss at 6 months, assessed by&#xD;
      angiography Additional secondary safety and effectiveness endpoints will be evaluated at 30&#xD;
      days, 6 and 12 months Using visual assessment, the target lesion must measure ≥ 2.5 mm and ≤&#xD;
      3.5 mm in diameter and ≤ 24 mm in length able to be covered by a single DynamX Sirolimus&#xD;
      Bioadaptor including 2 mm of healthy vessel on either side of the planned treatment area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be eligible for stent (also called bioadaptor) implantation only after&#xD;
      satisfactory lesion pre-dilatation defined as: ≥ TIMI 2 flow, and no dissection greater than&#xD;
      Grade B (NHLBI) able to be covered with a single DynamX SECBS&#xD;
