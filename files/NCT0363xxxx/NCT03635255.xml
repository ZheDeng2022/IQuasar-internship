  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronary artery disease (CAD) resulting from atherosclerotic obstruction of epicardial&#xD;
      coronary arteries accounts for more than one-third of deaths in subjects over the age of 35&#xD;
      worldwide. The global incidence of CAD is on the rise owing to the international epidemic of&#xD;
      obesity, type 2 diabetes and aging, all of which are potent risk factors for coronary&#xD;
      atherosclerosis. Participants with CAD are at high risk for subsequent adverse cardiovascular&#xD;
      (CV) events and death; it has been estimated that one out of every five CAD patients will&#xD;
      experience at least one adverse CV event during a 5-year follow up period. There is, however,&#xD;
      no reliable diagnostic tool to predict the risk of adverse CV events or death in participanrs&#xD;
      with CAD. Increasing evidence suggests that miRNAs are stably present in serum, plasma,&#xD;
      urine, saliva and other body fluids and are considered a novel class of non-invasive&#xD;
      biomarkers for various diseases including cancer, neurodegenerative and cardiovascular&#xD;
      diseases&#xD;

      Objective：To identify the novel circulating miRNA expression profiles that may serve as a&#xD;
      sensitive and reliable biomarker to predict future adverse CV outcomes and death in patients&#xD;
      with established CAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods：The investigators propose to utilize next-generation sequencing (RNASeq) to identify&#xD;
      the novel plasma miRNA expression signature linked to adverse CV outcomes in participanrs&#xD;
      with CAD. The identified miRNA candidates that are predictive of adverse CV events will be&#xD;
      validated in a larger independent cohort of CAD patients. In addition, miRNAs that are linked&#xD;
      to adverse CV outcomes in CAD patients will be investigated mechanistically in human aortic&#xD;
      endothelial cells to understand their functional contribution to the occurrence of adverse CV&#xD;
      events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What is New or Innovative in this Study? This study could be one of the few studies to&#xD;
      investigate circulating miRNAs as novel biomarkers for risk stratification and the clinical&#xD;
      outcome prediction in patients with established CAD. This report will also demonstrate that&#xD;
      some dysregulated circulating miRNAs might contribute to endothelial dysfunction and adverse&#xD;
      CV events in CAD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scientific or Clinical Implication of the Expected Results：The results from this study will&#xD;
      provide a new prognostic tool to predict CV outcomes in CAD patients using plasma miRNA&#xD;
      expression signature. It will also provide important scientific insights into the complex&#xD;
      non-coding RNA regulatory network involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. The&#xD;
      insights from this study may provide a unique opportunity to improve the risk assessment of&#xD;
      adverse CV events in CAD patients by targeting theses miRNAs.&#xD;

      Blood and Urine Sampling After enrollment, 20 mL of blood from peripheral vessels and 10 mL&#xD;
      urine were collected. Sampling collection was at the time of enrollment, and every 3 months&#xD;
      thereafter in 3-month intervals during outpatient clinic visits. These samples were stored in&#xD;
      a -80°C refrigerator until analysis for biomarkers and metabolomic study. Patients were&#xD;
      excluded if they had ingested any drugs with antioxidant activity, vitamins, or food&#xD;
      additives within the 4 weeks prior to blood/urine sampling.&#xD;
