      This is a pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators propose a pilot randomized, parallel-group, controlled trial comparing the&#xD;
      GoToSleep program (GTS) and controls on change in Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) from baseline&#xD;
      to week 8 in adults with epilepsy and moderate-to-severe insomnia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults with epilepsy and moderate-to-severe insomnia symptoms (ISI ≥15) 17 will be identified&#xD;
      using data collected as part of routine clinical care in the adult epilepsy clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be provided a consent form describing the study and provided sufficient&#xD;
      information to make an informed decision. After a screening visit, subjects meeting study&#xD;
      criteria will be randomized to the computerized cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia&#xD;
      (CCBT-i) using the GoTosleep (GTS) or the control group. Both groups will receive a sleep&#xD;
      hygiene handout that is standard of care in the treatment of insomnia. All subjects will be&#xD;
      contacted by phone every 2 weeks during the intervention to address questions related to&#xD;
      sleep hygiene instructions and use of the CCBT-i in the GoTosleep (GTS) group. All subjects&#xD;
      will complete a series of sleep related patient reported outcomes including the ISI at&#xD;
      baseline 8 weeks post randomization and maintain a diary recording of seizures and sleep&#xD;
      periods. Those randomized to CCBT-i will complete a questionnaire at week 8 assessing&#xD;
      barriers to CCBT-i.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects randomized to the control group will be offered access to the GoTosleep (GTS) at no&#xD;
      charge at the end of the study (week 8).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Growing interest in the relationship between epilepsy and sleep has resulted in a number of&#xD;
      investigations demonstrating the high prevalence of sleep disturbances and disorders in&#xD;
      people with epilepsy (PWE). PWE frequently report daytime sleepiness, insomnia, and other&#xD;
      sleep problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insomnia is among the most common sleep complaint in PWE. The prevalence of&#xD;
      moderate-to-severe insomnia using the ISI ranges from 15% to 51%. A recent case-control study&#xD;
      found an association between insomnia symptom severity and poorer seizure control. Difficulty&#xD;
      maintaining sleep is the most common insomnia presentation followed by difficulty initiating&#xD;
      sleep. Both patterns are accompanied by a decrease in total sleep time and an increase in the&#xD;
      number of awakenings, arousals and wake time after sleep onset, leading to a state of&#xD;
      relative sleep deprivation. Like epilepsy, insomnia disorders are commonly associated with&#xD;
      co-morbid depression in the general population, confirmed in a cohort of adults with epilepsy&#xD;
      from our own epilepsy center. In turn, treatment of depression has been shown to improve&#xD;
      insomnia in the general population. Further, improved seizure control has been observed&#xD;
      following treatment of other comorbid sleep disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea and&#xD;
      poor sleep hygiene. Innovative sleep treatments for PWE are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, there are no studies exploring sleep and seizure outcomes with treatment of insomnia&#xD;
      in PWE. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia(CBT-i) is generally the preferred initial&#xD;
      treatment for most cases of primary insomnia. CBT-i examines and promotes modifications in&#xD;
      thoughts and behaviors that perpetuate insomnia. The validity of CBT-i has been well&#xD;
      established and the American College of Physicians has acknowledged CBT-i as the first-line&#xD;
      therapy for insomnia with treatment effects that outlast those of sedative-hypnotic&#xD;
      medications. Despite its established efficacy, CBT-i is not widely accessible due to the lack&#xD;
      of trained clinicians, stigmatization in receiving psychological services, geographical&#xD;
      remoteness to trained providers and cost. Treatment typically involves a series of up to 10&#xD;
      visits at weekly or biweekly intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, CCBT-i programs have been developed that offer web-based treatment. One such&#xD;
      program is GoTo sleep (GTS), developed and validated by investigators at the Cleveland&#xD;
      Clinic. GTS constitutes 6 weeks of therapy based on the principles and methods of CBT-i&#xD;
      presented as a series of daily lessons, learnable skills, and personalized recommendations&#xD;
      supported by graphics, animations, audio and video. The program includes the basic elements&#xD;
      of CBT-i including sleep hygiene, sleep restriction, stimulus control, cognitive&#xD;
      restructuring and relaxation training. The efficacy of CCBT-i has been demonstrated in&#xD;
      several randomized controlled trials involving patients with primary insomnia including one&#xD;
      using GTS where the program was found to be superior to usual care (sleep hygiene&#xD;
      instruction) after 6 weeks of therapy. Further, we recently conducted a pilot study comparing&#xD;
      GTS and standard sleep hygiene instruction in Parkinson's disease patients with insomnia and&#xD;
      found a greater reduction in ISI scores with CCBT-i (-7.9 vs -3.5; p=0.03).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the prevalence of insomnia in epilepsy and the known association between seizure&#xD;
      occurrence and sleep impairment, the investigators hypothesize that treatment of insomnia&#xD;
      with CCBT-i will improve insomnia symptoms and seizure control in PWE.&#xD;
