    <textblock>
      This study evaluated the safety, tolerance, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of d-methadone in a&#xD;
      limited dose range, in multiple administrations in humans.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a phase 1, single-center study carried out in healthy male and female subjects to&#xD;
      investigate the safety, tolerability, and PK of multiple doses (25mg, 50mg, and 75mg once&#xD;
      daily) of d-methadone for 10 days. It was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      study in sequential cohorts of healthy subjects. Subjects participated in the study for&#xD;
      approximately 7 weeks. Eligible subjects were randomized within 30 days of screening. Of the&#xD;
      8 subjects in each cohort, 2 subjects received placebo and 6 subjects received d-methadone.&#xD;
      The duration of dosing ensured that steady-state plasma concentrations were achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single ascending dose study previously conducted by Relmada Therapeutics, Inc. demonstrated&#xD;
      that the maximum tolerated single dose for oral d-methadone in healthy opiate-naive subjects&#xD;
      was 150 mg. The single doses of d-methadone appeared to be safe, with no indication of&#xD;
      respiratory depression or clinically significant QTc prolongation, and minimal subjective&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic (PD) effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following assessments and procedures ensured the safety of the subjects during the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  continuous cardiac telemetry for 8 hours post-dose to detect any potential cardiac&#xD;
           issues&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  continuous pulse oximetry monitoring for 8 hours post-dose to detect any potential&#xD;
           respiratory distress&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  presence of a safety catheter to administer rescue medication (naloxone), if needed&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following signs of opioid toxicity were deemed to be of special interest:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  sustained respiratory depression that results in oxygen saturation below 92%&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  QTc prolongation (&gt;500 ms or &gt;70 ms above the baseline)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  protracted nausea and vomiting&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  any AE deemed by the investigator to be dose-limiting Safety Analysis Safety and&#xD;
           tolerability parameters were listed by treatment and subject and displayed in summary&#xD;
           tables using descriptive statistics. Original terms used to identify AEs were coded&#xD;
           using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), version 17.1. The&#xD;
           number and percentage of subjects with treatment emergent AEs (TEAEs) were summarized by&#xD;
           system organ class, preferred term, and treatment and for each treatment by maximum&#xD;
           intensity and maximum relationship to study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics for vital signs were calculated and presented for each time point by&#xD;
      treatment group (absolute values and change from baseline). Safety ECG results were&#xD;
      summarized using descriptive statistics; frequencies (numbers and percentages) were&#xD;
      calculated for the overall evaluation by scheduled time and treatment group. Laboratory data&#xD;
      were summarized by the type of test and scheduled visit. Descriptive statistics and number of&#xD;
      subjects with laboratory test results below, within, and above normal ranges were tabulated&#xD;
      by scheduled time. Abnormal findings in laboratory data were listed with a flag for clinical&#xD;
      significance. Medical history abnormalities were coded to MedDRA terms and listed. Physical&#xD;
      examination abnormalities were also listed. Data collected from the C-SSRS were classified&#xD;
      into the Columbia Classification Algorithm of Suicide Assessment (C-CASA) categories and were&#xD;
      listed. Frequency tables were used to summarize the total score from the COWS questionnaire,&#xD;
      by treatment group. The original verbatim terms for concomitant medications were coded into&#xD;
      drug class and preferred term. These data were listed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetic Analysis The PK parameters for d-methadone determined by non-compartmental&#xD;
      analysis were summarized by dose. Graphs of concentration (linear and log-linear) vs time&#xD;
      were generated. Descriptive statistics were calculated by dose and time point for all&#xD;
      d-methadone concentrations. Concentrations below the limit of quantification (BLQ) were&#xD;
      analyzed as outlined in the statistical analysis plan (SAP). Concentrations of l-methadone&#xD;
      were analyzed only if the majority of values were not BLQ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the calculation of the PK parameters, concentration-time data were treated as follows:&#xD;
      BLQ concentrations prior to the first quantifiable concentration were set to zero; BLQ&#xD;
      concentrations after the first quantifiable concentration were treated as missing; pre-dose&#xD;
      sampling times relative to dosing were set to zero. Descriptive statistics were calculated by&#xD;
      dose. The dose proportionality of Cmax and AUC was assessed by the Hummel method. Tmax and t½&#xD;
      for different doses were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacodynamic Analysis The PD data at each time point were summarized by descriptive&#xD;
      statistics and presented graphically (as appropriate). Derived endpoints were summarized&#xD;
      using descriptive statistics. Pupillometry constriction was listed and grouped by treatment&#xD;
      group and subject with descriptive statistics for changes from baseline for different time&#xD;
      points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Holter ECG Analysis (Cardiodynamic Analysis) The analysis of the Holter ECG data was&#xD;
      performed using SAS®. The average of the 3 pre-dose time points on Day 1 was used as baseline&#xD;
      for all post-dose time points. Heart rate and the PR, QRS, QT, and QTcF intervals collected&#xD;
      from all randomized subjects were presented in data listings with the same precision as in&#xD;
      the database. Data listings were sorted by treatment, subject number, day, and time point.&#xD;
      Both absolute and change from baseline values for each subject were provided.&#xD;

    <measure>Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 11 through 13</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS) is an 11-item scale designed to be administered by a clinician. This tool can be used in both inpatient and outpatient settings to reproducibly rate common signs and symptoms of opiate withdrawal and monitor these symptoms over time. The summed score for the complete scale can be used to help clinicians determine the stage or severity of opiate withdrawal and assess the level of physical dependence on opioids. The sum total of the 11 items are ranked by score. Score: 5- 1 2 = mild; 1 3-24 = moderate; 25-36 = moderately severe; more than 36 = severe withdrawal</description>

    <measure>Bond-Lader visual analog scale (VAS) assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-dose and 3 hours post-dose on Day 1 to Day 10 and 72 hours post last dose</time_frame>
    <description>The Bond-Lader visual analog scale (VAS) consists of 16 bipolar, self-rated, 101-point (from 0 to 100) scales between opposite adjectives. This VAS was adapted for computerized assessment. The subject had to indicate how they were feeling at the time of evaluation. Using a mouse, the subject positioned a cursor over a small vertical box (a &quot;slider&quot;) and clicked on it to move it left or right on a horizontal line. To register the response, the subject had to press the &quot;OK&quot; button that appeared below the horizontal line.</description>

    <measure>Pupillometry</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-dose and 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours post-dose from Day 2 to Day 9, and from Day 10 to Day 13</time_frame>
    <description>Pupillometry was used as an objective physiological PD measure as it is a sensitive measure of central opioid action and appears to be resistant to tolerance development with repeated administration. An electronic pupillometer was used to measure pupil diameter. Data from a series of frames were used in the calculation, and the final display showed the weighted average and standard deviation of the pupil size. Measurements were collected under mesopic lighting conditions.</description>
