  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is one of the most common liver malignancies. Surgical&#xD;
      treatment is the first choice. However, for patients without surgical indications, the&#xD;
      benefits of conventional chemoradiotherapy are limited. CART is one of the fastest developed&#xD;
      treatments in recent years. MUC-1 CART can target abnormal glycosylation of MUC-1 and then&#xD;
      killing tumor specifically. Here, investigators intend to evaluate the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      MUC-1 CART in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators chose MUC-1 positive intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma patients with one&#xD;
      measurable lesion at least. After general assessment, MUC-1 CART treatment was given to the&#xD;
      participants. Objective remission rate, disease control rate, duration of overall response,&#xD;
      progression-free survival, overall survival, drugs related side effects and other endpoints&#xD;
      events were recorded and analyzed, to assess the MUC-1 CART could or couldn't effectively&#xD;
      control the progress of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.&#xD;
