  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized clinical study is to confirm the utility of chemosensitivity&#xD;
      (ChemoID) tumor testing on cancer stem cells as a predictor of clinical response in recurrent&#xD;
      epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer, regardless of&#xD;
      platinum sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population studied will be female participants experiencing a 1st, 2nd, or 3rd recurrence of&#xD;
      any stage epithelial ovarian cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed as a parallel group randomized controlled clinical trial to determine&#xD;
      if recurrent Epithelial Ovarian Cancer (EOC) patients treated with Bevacizumab plus drugs&#xD;
      predicted by the ChemoID assay will have better outcomes than patients treated with&#xD;
      standard-of-care control therapy (Bevacizumab plus chemotherapy chosen by the Physician).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon obtaining informed consent, all eligible participants affected by 1st, 2nd, or 3rd&#xD;
      relapse of EOC regardless of platinum sensitivity (both platinum sensitive and resistant)&#xD;
      will have a tumor biopsy or a cancer-positive fluid collection sample to undergo ChemoID drug&#xD;
      response testing with multiple FDA-approved chemotherapeutic agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will be randomized to a standard treatment arm with control treatment&#xD;
      (Bevacizumab plus chemotherapy chosen by the Physician from the provided list), or to a study&#xD;
      arm of Bevacizumab plus FDA-approved drugs selected by the ChemoID drug response assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A stratified randomization approach for treatment arm assignment will be used with strata&#xD;
      based on relapse number, platinum sensitivity, and study site to ensure balance within these&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;

    <description>The ChemoID test is a CLIA-certified and CAP-accredited drug response assay performed by a hospital clinical pathology laboratory that uses patient's live tumor cells to indicate which chemotherapy agent (or combinations) will kill not only bulk of tumor cells, but importantly the cancer stem cells (CSCs) that are known to cause cancer to recur. During the assay, cancer stem cells and bulk tumor cells from an individual patient are exposed to FDA-approved chemotherapy drugs.&#xD;
The test measures the cytotoxic effect of actual doses of standard-of-care chemotherapies. The ChemoID drug response assay reports a prioritized list of effective and ineffective chemotherapies. The test is designed to target cancer stem cells to mitigate tumor relapse.</description>

             select chemotherapy regimens;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  8. Previously participated in this study;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  9. Any condition that would, in the opinion of the investigator, place the participant&#xD;

          -  10. Documented history of ovarian cancer of a low malignant potential phenotype or&#xD;
