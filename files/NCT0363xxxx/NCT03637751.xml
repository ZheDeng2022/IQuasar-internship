  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given the salient role of early-life adversity and the resulting biological embedding in&#xD;
      disease risk, there is a critical need to understand the mechanisms operating at multiple&#xD;
      levels of analysis in order to promote effective clinical treatments and intervention efforts&#xD;
      for survivors. An example for such an effort could be to utilize models of dynamic cellular&#xD;
      markers as individual-level factors to account for variation in intervention response and&#xD;
      clinical outcomes. Results of this study will lead to new knowledge about specific gene&#xD;
      expression pathways in response to stress, and whether the response is moderated by previous&#xD;
      exposure to early adversity, shorter telomere length (a marker of cellular aging) and&#xD;
      self-report mental-health measures. Thus, the long-term effects of this study will advance&#xD;
      our understanding on stress-related transcriptomic changes that play a downstream role in&#xD;
      disease susceptibility and accelerated aging, with the goal of targeting specific pathways&#xD;
      and genes for potential intervention studies and pharmacological treatments to reverse the&#xD;
      effects of exposure to early adversity. For example, considering high failure rates for&#xD;
      depression treatments, and in order to tailor individual interventions, identifying objective&#xD;
      changes in stress-induced gene expression may help to predict intervention efficacy in&#xD;
      clinical and non-clinical settings, as seen, for example, in breast and leukemia cancers.&#xD;
      Thus, findings will have a range of impacts for basic science, intervention studies and&#xD;
      clinical practice that will influence treatments to match the specific cellular processes&#xD;
      operating within an individual.&#xD;

    <description>Testing will be carried out in Penn State's Clinical Research Center (CRC). The CRC has rooms for conducting the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) stress-task and for resting. Participants will make two visits to the CRC, one week apart, on the same day of the weekday. Sessions will be scheduled from 11:00 am to 4:15 pm. We will use a randomized counter-balanced order for the two sessions (i.e., TSST and control conditions) with group membership blind to the subjects and lab personnel.</description>
