    <textblock>
      in more than 60% of premature children processing speed and academic failures are observed,&#xD;
      even in children with a normal cognitive level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to use for rehabilitation an application for training functional&#xD;
      cognitive skills (Intendu®). It is a software which is able to interact with the patient&#xD;
      through a video monitoring feedback (Kinect®), enhancing brain plasticity of patients with&#xD;
      brain dysfunction.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Europe 6.2% of the births are born before 37 weeks of gestation. After a long period in&#xD;
      Neonatal Intensive Care Units, the infants are dismissed but they continue to be examined in&#xD;
      follow-up programs. It is known that advances in care have improved the rate of survival of&#xD;
      premature newborns, but unfortunately they may have disabilities which can be severe&#xD;
      (cerebral palsy) or mild. Mild disabilities (like attention deficit, hyperactivity,&#xD;
      visual-perceptual and coordination disorders), even if mild, can have a significant impact on&#xD;
      school achievements and social life. Follow-up program is dedicated to detect both severe and&#xD;
      minor disabilities, trying to rehabilitate the children before they start formal education in&#xD;
      school. It is well known that more than half of premature children can show impairment of&#xD;
      processing speed and academic failures, even with normal cognitive level. Processing speed is&#xD;
      the result of the action of different executive functions, especially working memory,&#xD;
      planning, attention shift, inhibition and persistence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is growing interest over cognitive rehabilitation with video games. Recently an&#xD;
      application for training functional cognitive skills (Intendu®) has been developed . It is a&#xD;
      software which is able to interact with patients through a video monitoring feedback&#xD;
      (Kinect®), enhancing brain plasticity of patients with brain dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate whether an adaptive motion-interaction video game can improve processing speed&#xD;
      and executive functions in premature children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      35 children born prematurely (23-36.5 W) aged 4-6 year-old with reduced processing speed,&#xD;
      will be invited to participate if they meet the inclusion criteria. They will be submitted to&#xD;
      4-5 weeks intensive training with Intendu®, (4-5 sessions per week, for a total of 20&#xD;
      sessions) lasting 15 minutes each, in the presence of a tutor (a psychologist expert in&#xD;
      premature children). A control group of 35 children (no training) with the same&#xD;
      characteristics (gestational age, cognitive profile, socio-economic status) will be&#xD;
      available. Before and after the training/or no training the participants, in addition to the&#xD;
      scheduled follow-up assessment, will be evaluated with two WPPSI-III®-Wechsler Preschool and&#xD;
      Primary Scale of Intelligence subtests (Coding and Symbol search) and one Nepsy II® domain-A&#xD;
      developmental Neuropsychological Assessment (attention and executive function). Teacher and&#xD;
      parents evaluations will be also considered (school reports and Child Behavior Checklist -&#xD;
      questionnaire)&#xD;
