      Patients and partners undergoing an autologous IVF cycle will be recruited to participate in&#xD;
      this prospective observational study investigating the microbiome and its association with&#xD;
      IVF pregnancy outcomes. During the the controlled ovarian hyperstimulation cycle as well as&#xD;
      the frozen embryo transfer cycle, a number of specimens will be collected for next generation&#xD;
      sequencing of 16S rRNA to evaluate the microbiome profile of the reproductive and&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tracts. Data on pregnancy outcomes will be collected prospectively and&#xD;
      evaluated to identify associations with the microbiome.&#xD;

      PURPOSE OF STUDY&#xD;
&#xD;
      To characterize the microbiome of the female reproductive tract and gastrointestinal tract as&#xD;
      well as the male reproductive tract in patients and partners undergoing IVF and determine if&#xD;
      there are any associations with pregnancy outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Clinical Problem&#xD;
&#xD;
      The microbiome of the reproductive tract and its association with reproductive outcomes is a&#xD;
      topic of evolving interest. Alterations in the vaginal microbiome have been linked to&#xD;
      obstetric complications including miscarriage and preterm birth. More recent data have&#xD;
      emerged linking the vaginal microbiome to assisted reproductive technology (ART) outcomes. A&#xD;
      prospective observational study consisting of 30 patients who had swabs collected at various&#xD;
      time points during the in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET) cycle for sequencing&#xD;
      of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene concluded that the species diversity of the vaginal microbiome&#xD;
      distinguished women who had a live birth from those who did not with increased diversity&#xD;
      being associated with poorer outcomes; however, the patient population was heterogeneous and&#xD;
      small.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Limited information is available regarding the microbiome of the upper genital tract and its&#xD;
      association with reproductive outcomes, particularly in the setting of ART. Studies done&#xD;
      solely for the purpose of characterizing the upper genital tract microbiome have relied on&#xD;
      hysterectomy specimens to assess colonization, thus precluding evaluation of any association&#xD;
      with reproductive outcomes. Perhaps the first study to investigate the association between&#xD;
      the microbiome of the upper reproductive tract and ART outcomes utilized culture-based&#xD;
      technology on embryo transfer catheter tips. However, this study utilized culture-based&#xD;
      technology, with only four major bacteria were reported. Subsequent studies have highlighted&#xD;
      the limitations of culture-based technology, namely that it is reliant upon successful&#xD;
      culture, often resulting in an underestimate of the diversity of organisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As sequencing-based technology has gained popularity and limitations of culture-based&#xD;
      technology have become more evident, there has been an increased interest in using sequencing&#xD;
      to characterize the microbiome. One recent study utilized next-generation sequencing (NGS)&#xD;
      based technology on embryo transfer catheter tips to evaluate the bacteria specific 16S&#xD;
      ribosomal gene for characterization of the upper genital tract microbiome in patients&#xD;
      undergoing embryo transfer. Although it served as proof of concept for this method of&#xD;
      characterizing the microbiome, the limited sample size did not permit any conclusions to be&#xD;
      drawn regarding its association with reproductive outcomes. A subsequent study utilizing&#xD;
      sequence-based technology examined endometrial fluid and vaginal aspirate samples in 35 women&#xD;
      in the cycle prior to IVF and found that the presence of non-Lactobacillus-dominated&#xD;
      microbiota in the endometrium was associated with significant decreases in implantation,&#xD;
      ongoing pregnancy and live birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although there is some data linking reproductive health and the microbiome of the female&#xD;
      reproductive tract, less information exists regarding its association with the microbiome of&#xD;
      the male reproductive tract. One cross-sectional study examining the microbial colonization&#xD;
      of semen demonstrated an association with semen parameters. Another study which examined&#xD;
      vaginal and seminal cultures on 951 couples undergoing IVF found that positive bacterial&#xD;
      cultures from both the vagina and semen decreased clinical pregnancy rate and increased&#xD;
      miscarriage rate more than vaginal infection alone. The microbiome of the male reproductive&#xD;
      tract warrants further investigation in this setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gastrointestinal tract microbiome plays a major role in human health and disease, with&#xD;
      many documented associations to disease states such as obesity, diabetes, and&#xD;
      gastrointestinal disorders. Recent data suggests that alterations in gastrointestinal tract&#xD;
      microbiota are associated with preterm labor. The urinary tract microbiome has been similarly&#xD;
      studied and linked to multiple disease states such as urinary incontinence and chronic&#xD;
      prostatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, there are no published studies that examine the association of the gastrointestinal&#xD;
      tract microbiome or urinary microbiota with pregnancy outcomes following IVF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The human microbiome is thought to modulate the immune system and the presence of systemic&#xD;
      inflammation. There is a growing interest in the association of chronic systemic inflammation&#xD;
      and reproductive disorders. A number of biomarkers that reflect chronic systemic inflammation&#xD;
      have been identified. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is one such biomarker that has documented&#xD;
      associations with PCOS, endometriosis, and infertility. Such biomarkers have not yet been&#xD;
      studied in association with pregnancy outcomes following IVF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this research is to perform a large-scale prospective observational study&#xD;
      seeking to characterize the microbiome of the female reproductive tract (both upper and&#xD;
      lower) at different time points in patients undergoing IVF. Furthermore, we plan to examine&#xD;
      the female gastrointestinal tract microbiome, female urinary microbiota, and the microbiome&#xD;
      of the male reproductive tract by collecting targeted specimens during patients' treatment&#xD;
      cycles. Lastly, we will evaluate female and male serum for biomarkers of inflammation. We aim&#xD;
      to identify any associations with pregnancy outcomes that may serve as a basis for a&#xD;
      subsequent interventional study.&#xD;

&#xD;
      The proposed study is a prospective observational study which seeks to characterize the&#xD;
      microbiome of the female reproductive tract at various time points during an IVF cycle and&#xD;
      determine if there are any differences in the microbiome with respect to pregnancy outcomes.&#xD;
      In addition, samples will be collected to evaluate the microbiome of the female&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract, female urinary microbiota, the male reproductive tract and biomarkers&#xD;
      of systemic inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Related Clinical Procedures and Analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients initiating an autologous IVF cycle at our center will be reviewed for inclusion.&#xD;
      Patients who meet study criteria will be contacted for possible enrollment. Once enrolled,&#xD;
      patients and partners will be consented to participate in the study. They will proceed with&#xD;
      treatment according to routine protocol and specimens will be collected for evaluation of the&#xD;
      microbiome at designated time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The only study-related procedures that deviate from routine care will be the collection of&#xD;
      specimens to be used for characterization of the microbiome and systemic inflammation at&#xD;
      several time points throughout their care:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Female&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  During the fresh IVF cycle: An additional tube of blood will be collected from the&#xD;
                female partner at the time of a routine blood draw for cycle monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Day of oocyte retrieval: A mid-stream urine sample will be provided by the female&#xD;
                partner on the morning of oocyte retrieval. Cervical, vaginal, buccal and rectal&#xD;
                swabs will be collected from the patient while under sedation just prior to the&#xD;
                oocyte retrieval procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  During the FET cycle: An additional tube of blood will be collected from the female&#xD;
                partner at the time of a routine blood draw for cycle monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Mid-proliferative scan during the first FET cycle: After a minimum of 8 days of&#xD;
                estrogen exposure, a second set of cervical and vaginal swabs will be collected&#xD;
                immediately prior to the patient's scheduled ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Day of FET: When the patient presents for embryo transfer, a third set of cervical&#xD;
                and vaginal swabs will be collected immediately prior to performing the embryo&#xD;
                transfer. In addition, the most distal 5 mm portion of the transfer catheter will&#xD;
                be collected after the embryo has been transferred.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Male&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  During the fresh IVF cycle: One tube of blood will be drawn from the male partner.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Day of oocyte retrieval: A swab will be collected from the fresh semen specimen&#xD;
                provided by the partner prior to any processing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood will be allowed to clot prior to centrifugation. The specimens will be aliquoted and&#xD;
      transferred to a -80°C for storage. They will subsequently be thawed as needed to analyze&#xD;
      biomarkers of systemic inflammation. Remaining aliquots will be stored for potential future&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All other specimens will undergo cell lysis, DNA purification, and next-generation sequencing&#xD;
      of the bacteria specific 16S ribosome gene according to previously published protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cycle outcomes will be recorded according to routine practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D. Risk/Safety Information:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main risks of the blood draws are discomfort, bleeding, and bruising. All attempts will&#xD;
      be made to coordinate collection of study blood with routine blood draws performed as part of&#xD;
      the patient's clinical care. The main risk of vaginal/cervical swab collection is discomfort.&#xD;
      Collection of the buccal and rectal swabs will be done under anesthesia at the time of the&#xD;
      oocyte retrieval and therefore does not carry this risk. Collection of the mid-stream urine&#xD;
      sample will be done when the patient empties her bladder prior to oocyte retrieval and does&#xD;
      not pose any additional risks. Collection of the semen specimen does not involve any&#xD;
      additional risk as the partner is providing a specimen as part of the treatment plan and the&#xD;
      swab is collected after provision of the specimen. Collection of the transfer catheter tip&#xD;
      does not involve any additional risk as it is performed after the embryo transfer is complete&#xD;
      and does not directly involve the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E. Data Management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical evaluation of the results&#xD;
&#xD;
      The microbiome at the various time points will be compared for patients with an ongoing&#xD;
      pregnancy (as defined by presence of a fetal heartbeat at time of discharge) and those&#xD;
      without. To characterize the diversity of samples, two alpha diversity metrics will be&#xD;
      utilized: the Shannon diversity index (SDI) and chao1.&#xD;
