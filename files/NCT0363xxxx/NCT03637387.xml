  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of BIIB074 in treating pain&#xD;
      experienced by participants with trigeminal neuralgia (TN).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to investigate the safety and tolerability of BIIB074 in&#xD;
      participants with TN and to evaluate the population pharmacokinetic(s) (PK) of BIIB074.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>A participant who meets all of the following criteria will be classified as a responder: (1) Has a reduction of &gt;=30% in mean pain score compared with baseline; (2) Has not discontinued randomized treatment before the end of Week 12 of the double-blind period; (3) Has not taken prohibited pain medication before the end of Week 12 of the double-blind period.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Experiencing Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) During the Long Term Extension (LTE) Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 52 of the LTE</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product. An SAE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: results in death; in the view of the Investigator, places the subject at immediate risk of death (a life-threatening event; however, this does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death); requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; or results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Classified as Responders Achieving Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) Response at Week 12 of the Double-Blind Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>A participant who meets all of the following criteria will be classified as a responder: (1) Achieving Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) response of &quot;Much Improved&quot; or &quot;Very Much Improved&quot; at Week 12 of the double-blind period; (2) has not discontinued randomized study treatment before the end of Week 12 of the double-blind period; (3) has not taken prohibited pain medication before the end of Week 12 of the double-blind period. PGIC is a 7-item self-report scale depicting a participant's rating of overall improvement. Participants rate their change as &quot;very much improved,&quot; &quot;much improved,&quot; &quot;minimally improved,&quot; &quot;no change,&quot; &quot;minimally worse,&quot; &quot;much worse,&quot; or &quot;very much worse.&quot;</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 1, Week 2, 4, 6, 8, every 12 weeks up to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The Penn-FPS-R is a new 12-item Health-Related Quality of Life outcome measure with content validity that can be used to assess and monitor the impact of Trigeminal Neuralgia and facial pain treatment interventions in both clinical practice and research. This scale uses the 0-10 numeric rating scale (NRS) to quantify the pain impact different activities and quality of life items, where 0 indicates no interference and 10 indicates complete interference. The sum of the rated NRS score will be calculated.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 1, Week 4, 8, every 12 weeks up to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>EQ-5D-5L is a standardized, subject-rated instrument for use as a measure of health outcomes. The EQ 5D-5L includes 2 components: the EQ-5D-5L descriptive system and the EQ-Visual Analog Scale (EQ-VAS). The EQ-5D-5L descriptive system provides a profile of the participant's health state in 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression). For each dimension, the participant is instructed to indicate whether he or she has no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the WPAI Neuropathic Pain (V2.0) Score by Visit During the Long Term Extension (LTE) Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 1, Week 4, 8, every 12 weeks up to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The WPAI questionnaire is a validated instrument to measure impairments in work and activities. The WPAI yields four types of scores: 1. Absenteeism (percentage of work time missed) 2. Presenteeism (percentage of impairment at work/reduced on-the-job effectiveness) 3. Work productivity loss (percentage of overall work impairment [absenteeism plus presenteeism]) 4. Activity Impairment (percentage of overall activity impairment). WPAI outcomes are expressed as impairment percentages, with higher numbers indicating greater impairment and less productivity.</description>
