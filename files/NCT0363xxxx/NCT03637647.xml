      Primary Aim: The present study is a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected&#xD;
      clinical data. Anonymized data from patients collected during routine clinical care from 9&#xD;
      units in the United Kingdom who undertake upper gastrointestinal (UGI) cancer surgery and&#xD;
      perform pre-operative cardiopulmonary exercise testing will be interrogated. Data will be&#xD;
      pooled at a central location (University Hospitals Southampton) and used to investigate the&#xD;
      relationship between selected cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) variables, in-hospital&#xD;
      post-operative and survival outcomes after major UGI cancer surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale: Our primary aim is to establish a reliable relationship between post-operative&#xD;
      1-year survival and oxygen uptake ( o2) at peak exercise ( o2 Peak); a secondary aim is to&#xD;
      explore the multivariable relationship between selected CPET variables especially o2 at the&#xD;
      estimated lactate threshold/anaerobic threshold ( L), together with other selected CPET&#xD;
      derived variables, and other important prognostic variables with post-operative complications&#xD;
      (morbidity and mortality) in an attempt to risk stratify patients before major UGI surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Design: Multicentre observational&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria: We aim to include all patients aged &gt;18 years considered eligible by the&#xD;
      MDT for major curative UGI cancer surgery and undergoing an enhanced recovery programme after&#xD;
      surgery. Patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapies will also be&#xD;
      included. Patients having a CPET and initially scheduled for curative surgery, but end up not&#xD;
      having surgery due to disease progression or other clinical reasons will be included and&#xD;
      analysed separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria: Patients will be excluded if they are physically unable to perform a CPET&#xD;
      on a cycle ergometer, patients having emergency surgery, patients lacking complete&#xD;
      in-hospital morbidity or mortality data and patients undergoing preoperative exercise&#xD;
      interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Trial Endpoints: 1 year overall survival&#xD;

      Study overview and background&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesise that reduced physical fitness (measured objectively using Cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      Exercise Testing (CPET)) will result in worse post-operative surgical outcome (reduced 1-year&#xD;
      overall survival, and increased in-hospital morbidity measured by Clavien-Dindo-Demartines&#xD;
      Score). We propose multicentre patient recruitment and analyses of routinely collected&#xD;
      clinical data, in an attempt interrogate this hypothesis in patients prior to upper&#xD;
      gastrointestinal cancer surgery. Patients undergoing cancer therapies pre-operatively&#xD;
      (neoadjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy) will be included in the analyses. Patients&#xD;
      that become ineligible for an operation, mainly due to metastasis or progression of their&#xD;
      cancer on neoadjuvant cancer treatments will also be included but will be analysed&#xD;
      separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite advances in anti-cancer therapies, surgery remains the most important treatment for&#xD;
      oesophageal and gastric cancer. Major UGI cancer surgery carries substantial morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality, particularly in elderly patients and those with co-morbidities. Recent UK cancer&#xD;
      audits show 30-day mortality of up to 3% for elective surgery and a 90-day mortality rate of&#xD;
      5.2%. Outcomes after major cancer surgery depend on modifiable factors such as peri-operative&#xD;
      medical care and intra-operative technique and what were previously thought to be&#xD;
      unmodifiable components, such as the ability of the patient to tolerate surgical trauma.&#xD;
      Centralisation of services and optimisation of perioperative pathways have led to improved&#xD;
      outcomes, but substantial gains may yet be achieved with accurate and objective preoperative&#xD;
      risk prediction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current approaches to risk prediction include a plethora of prediction scores and tests, but&#xD;
      none have proven efficacy above experienced clinical acumen. More recently reduced physical&#xD;
      fitness (objectively measured using CardioPulmonary Exercise Testing - CPET) has been&#xD;
      associated with increased postoperative morbidity in a variety of major surgical cohorts.&#xD;
      CPET provides an objective method of evaluating physical fitness under stress, partly&#xD;
      mimicking the stress of a major surgical event. Accurate risk prediction methods prior to&#xD;
      surgery or indeed other forms of 'trauma' like pre-operative cancer therapies might allow&#xD;
      better patient selection, permit modification of the patients preoperative status, as well as&#xD;
      improve the optimisation of intra- and postoperative management, and enhances shared&#xD;
      decision-making. Furthermore CPET allows interrogation of the causes of exercise intolerance,&#xD;
      when exercise capacity is reduced, with the exciting opportunity of intolerance modulation&#xD;
      for therapeutic gain (Fit for Surgery).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, 37 cohort studies (including over 7,800 patients) have reported the relationship&#xD;
      between preoperative CPET-derived variables and postoperative outcome. These data have been&#xD;
      brought together in several systematic reviews that, in summary, show a remarkably consistent&#xD;
      positive correlation between physical fitness and postoperative outcome. The Southampton&#xD;
      based Fit-4-Surgery group have clearly demonstrated this in patients undergoing major&#xD;
      colorectal surgery, however the relationship between fitness and post-operative outcomes in&#xD;
      UGI cancer surgery is not yet well defined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in all the recruiting centres will undergo a maximal CPET prior to major UGI cancer&#xD;
      surgery (defined as a procedure involving oesophageal, junctional or gastric cancer&#xD;
      resection) according to the CPET protocol defined in Appendix 1 of protocol. If the CPET&#xD;
      deviates from this protocol, the centre would need to clear their local CPET protocol with&#xD;
      the Chief Investigator (CI). All variables measured by CPET that will be collected are&#xD;
      outlined in Appendix 2 of protocol. If the patient is scheduled to have neoadjuvant cancer&#xD;
      therapies, the recruiting site might elect to test patients pre- and post the neoadjuvant&#xD;
      therapy to estimate the change in fitness. This is based on changes observed in fitness with&#xD;
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy in UGI and chemoradiotherapy in rectal cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following surgery only routine clinically relevant observational data will be collected.&#xD;
      These data will relate to hospital length of stay, the level of care required following&#xD;
      surgery, post-operative morbidity (Postoperative Morbidity Survey - POMS and/or&#xD;
      Clavien-Dindo-Demartins Score) and the recovery process. Most of this information can be&#xD;
      accessed from prospectively maintained enhanced recovery databases, however electronic&#xD;
      patient records that are maintained and recorded prospectively are also acceptable&#xD;
      alternatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each site would also contribute existing data held on the hospital patient database in&#xD;
      addition to recruiting patients as they present at the hospital as per methodology above. All&#xD;
      data from each individual hospital will be anonymized at source by the PI prior to transfer&#xD;
      to the CI and any analyses. CPET variables, post-operative outcome data, and basic patient&#xD;
      demographics (outlined in Appendix 2 of the protocol) cannot be linked back to the original&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients undergoing CPET at each NHS site are given a patient information sheet related&#xD;
      to risks and benefits related to CPET and routinely undergo written consent prior to testing,&#xD;
      also asking for their permission for these data to be used for research purposes.&#xD;

      HYPOTHESIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study tests the hypothesis that selected CPET variables are related to 1-year overall&#xD;
      survival and to in-hospital morbidity in patients undergoing major UGI cancer surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our primary aim is to establish a reliable relationship between 1-year overall survival&#xD;
      (present or absent) and oxygen uptake (Vo2) at peak exercise (Vo2 Peak); a secondary aim is&#xD;
      to explore the multivariable relationship between Vo2 at the estimated lactate threshold&#xD;
      (LT), other selected CPET variables (weight, BMI and Body Surface Area (BSA) adjusted) and&#xD;
      other important prognostic variables with post-operative complications in an attempt to risk&#xD;
      stratify patients before major surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. DATA ANALYSES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiopulmonary Exercise Tests (CPET)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CPET involves cycling on an exercise bike for 8-12 minutes. Starting with a very low&#xD;
      resistance on the pedals the patient will pedal at 60 revolutions per minute. After 3 minutes&#xD;
      of cycling, the resistance will gradually increase until the patient can no longer turn the&#xD;
      pedals at the required speed. The test will be thoroughly explained to the patient beforehand&#xD;
      and trained staff will make the experience as comfortable as possible. CPETs will be stopped&#xD;
      early by the study researcher/doctor in the presence of any adverse events. Each CPET&#xD;
      appointment will last approximately one hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CPETs carry a small risk (1:10,000) of exercise induced myocardial infarction or dysrhythmia.&#xD;
      Patients are continuously monitored using a 12 lead electrocardiograph (ECG) during all tests&#xD;
      and recovery. The CPET test will entail the patient becoming slightly hot or maybe sweaty,&#xD;
      and appropriate clothing should be worn. The patient's heart will be monitored by an&#xD;
      electrocardiogram. The patient will wear a soft rubber mask in order to continuously sample&#xD;
      expired air with an online breath-by-breath gas analyzer. This may cause some mild&#xD;
      claustrophobia. Full detail of the CPET procedure is given in appendix 1. Accredited doctors&#xD;
      or allied health professionals with experience in analysis of exercise tests will analyse all&#xD;
      of the exercise data. Patients will be anonymised and the person performing the data analysis&#xD;
      will be blinded to the outcome data. All data will be stored, processed and analysed on&#xD;
      secure NHS computers on NHS encrypted and password-protected servers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-parametric receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves will be constructed for Vo2 at&#xD;
      LT, Vo2 at Peak, O2 Pulse at LT and ventilatory equivalents for carbon dioxide ( E/ co2 at L)&#xD;
      in order to assess their independent ability to discriminate between patients with and&#xD;
      without post-operative morbidity. All selected CPET variables will be adjusted for weight,&#xD;
      BMI and BSA. Optimal cut-points will be obtained by minimising the distance between points on&#xD;
      the ROC curve and the upper left corner. Variables (to satisfy the 10 events per variable&#xD;
      rule) will be identified as candidates for a multivariable logistic regression model&#xD;
      including but not limited to: Vo2 at LT and at Peak, gender, operation type&#xD;
      (laparoscopic/open), and O2 Pulse at LT and VE/VCo2 at LT. A final multivariable model will&#xD;
      be obtained using forward stepwise selection (minimising Akaike Information Criteria (AIC)).&#xD;
      Its sensitivity to variable exclusion and re-inclusion will also be assessed using AIC. Model&#xD;
      fit will be assessed using the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test. In order to explore the&#xD;
      univariate relationship between CPET variables and length of stay, continuous CPET variables&#xD;
      will be dichotomised at the optimal cut-point for the ROC curve and Kaplan-Meier curves will&#xD;
      be constructed. The log rank test will be used to compare survival curves; patients who died&#xD;
      before discharge will be treated as right-censored. All analyses will be conducted using&#xD;
      Stata (StataCorp. 2011 Stata Statistical Software: Release 12. College Station, TX: StataCorp&#xD;
      LP.). Continuous variables will be reported as mean and standard deviation (SD) or median and&#xD;
      inter-quartile range (IQR) depending on the distribution. Categorical variables will be&#xD;
      presented as frequency (percentage). P-values will be obtained using univariate logistic&#xD;
      regression (continuous) and Chi-squared or Fisher's Exact tests (categorical). Statistical&#xD;
      significance will be taken at 5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We anticipate an overall death rate of 33.5% in 12 months post-surgery. We assumed that the&#xD;
      death event rate would increase in the unfit (control) patient group up to 50% while the fit&#xD;
      group would show the same average of 33.5% rate thus showing a difference of at least 16.5%.&#xD;
      We consider that this size of the effect (50% reduced to 33.5%) is clinically relevant.&#xD;
      Assuming 5% (2-sided) significance and 90% power, 150 events are needed to detect this size&#xD;
      of difference in a log-rank survival comparison of the two trial groups. This requires 376&#xD;
      patients in total in the analysis. We will inflate this total by approximately 20% to allow&#xD;
      for attrition, giving a target recruitment of 470 patients (with complete data on CPET&#xD;
      variables and outcome).&#xD;
