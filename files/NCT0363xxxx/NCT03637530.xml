  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Carbon dioxide insufflations of abdomen are integral part of laparoscopic operations in&#xD;
      minimally invasive surgery era. It does cause splinting effect on diaphragm movement and set&#xD;
      it high inside thoracic cavity too. In turn it will be associated with increase in peak and&#xD;
      plateau airway pressure during positive pressure ventilation. Inverse ratio ventilation has&#xD;
      been shown to improve lung compliance and restrict the peak and plateau airway pressure and&#xD;
      should be useful as one of the lung protective ventilation method to improve respiratory&#xD;
      outcome in laparoscopy surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anaesthesiologists have been ventilating patients in the perioperative period with relatively&#xD;
      large tidal volumes (10-15 ml/kg ideal body weight) to prevent intraoperative atelectasis.&#xD;
      Ventilating patient with large tidal volumes may be a risk factor for development of lung&#xD;
      injury.During surgical procedures, both general anesthesia and high tidal volumes may strain&#xD;
      non injured lungs and trigger inflammation. High tidal volumes that cause alveolar&#xD;
      overstretching can contribute to extra pulmonary organ dysfunction through systemic release&#xD;
      of inflammatory mediators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently protective lung ventilation strategies has been reported to be useful to reduce the&#xD;
      respiratory complications in postoperative period. The use of small tidal volume (Vt),&#xD;
      positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and restricting peak airway pressure have shown&#xD;
      reduced incidence of ventilation induced lung injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been shown that a small tidal volume (VT) and PEEP can reduce the incidence of&#xD;
      postoperative lung dysfunction and improve intraoperative oxygenation. Restricting peak&#xD;
      airway pressure can be achieved by inverse ratio ventilation. Minimizing the risk of&#xD;
      ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), improving oxygenation and alveolar recruitment are all&#xD;
      advantages of inverse ratio ventilation. However, the potential utility of pressure&#xD;
      controlled inverse ratio ventilation (PCIRV) has not been studied in patients undergoing&#xD;
      general anaesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators hypothesized that in patients with normal lungs scheduled for general&#xD;
      anesthesia, PIV might prevent lung function deterioration and lung morphological alterations.&#xD;
      Investiagators aim was to compare the intraoperative protective ventilation strategies on&#xD;
      oxygenation/ ventilation and postoperative lung dysfunction and lung injury among patients&#xD;
      undergoing laparoscopic upper abdominal surgery.&#xD;
