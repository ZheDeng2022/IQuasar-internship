  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The smoke produced by the electric section of the tissues during laparoscopy alters the&#xD;
      vision of the operative field and presents potential risks. A new medical device with CE&#xD;
      marking (Ultravision ©) has been developed to limit electroprecipitation on the wall and&#xD;
      tissues of the abdomen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the work is to evaluate the effectiveness of this medical device in laparoscopic&#xD;
      cholecystectomy for cholecystitis. It is an intervention for a common pathology where smoke&#xD;
      is particularly important due to the tissue inflammation and due to the extensive dissection&#xD;
      necessary to perform the surgical procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized double-blinded study will be conducted in two academic hospitals (Marseille&#xD;
      North Hospital and Timone, APHM) evaluating the use of a smoke electroprecipitation device&#xD;
      (Ultravision ©) during laparoscopic cholecystectomy for cholecystitis operated at the acute&#xD;
      phase. A group of 30 patients using the device will be compared to a control group of 30&#xD;
      patients. The evaluation will last thirty days per patient and the duration of inclusion is 2&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to demonstrate a significant reduction in operating duration by using&#xD;
      the device. The secondary objectives are to reduce the CO2 consumption, the surgical&#xD;
      incidents and the discomfort of the surgeon related to the smoke.&#xD;

    <description>Ultravision © is a medical device that is used during laparoscopy to reduce the discomfort caused by surgical smoke produced by the electrical section of tissue. It works by using the principle of electrostatic precipitation, that is to say it causes the precipitation of suspended smoke droplets on the organs and walls of the abdomen.</description>
