  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is for patients who have previously been treated for Waldenström's&#xD;
      macroglobulinaemia (WM) and their disease has either not responded (known as refractory&#xD;
      disease) or has returned (known as relapsed disease). Through this study, the researchers&#xD;
      would like to find out whether treating these patients with drugs called rituximab and&#xD;
      pembrolizumab is a safe and effective combination for this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, pembrolizumab and rituximab will be given together. In other studies&#xD;
      pembrolizumab has been shown to be effective at treating diseases similar to WM. The&#xD;
      researchers want to test whether giving pembrolizumab and rituximab together is safe and&#xD;
      effective.&#xD;
