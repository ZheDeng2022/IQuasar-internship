&#xD;
      3.Trial design: This is a monocenter, single arm, phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of neoadjuvant chemoradiation plus PD-1 antibody (SHR-1210) in patients with locally&#xD;
      advanced proximal stomach adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.Treatment plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be given the perioperative treatment as below once recruited:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. induction chemotherapy (3w): one cycle of XELOX regimen (capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 bid*14d&#xD;
           + oxaliplatin 130mg/m2, d1, Q21d);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. within one week after the induction, concurrent chemoradiation will be started (5w):&#xD;
           intensity modulated radiotherapy was given for tumors and high-risk lymphatic drainage&#xD;
           areas, total dose:45Gy/25d, 1.8Gy/d, capecitabine (850 mg/m2, bid, po) will be given&#xD;
           during radiotherapy as sensitizer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. consolidation chemotherapy will be started in 2-3w after concurrent chemoradiation: one&#xD;
           cycle of XELOX regimen (capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 bid*14d + oxaliplatin 130mg/m2, d1,&#xD;
           Q21d); From the beginning of induction chemo to 3w before surgery, PD-1 antibody&#xD;
           SHR-1210 will be given（200mg, iv, q3w).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Re-evaluation will be conducted in 1-3w after consolidation chemo, resectable patients will&#xD;
      receive D2 resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adjuvant chemo: We advice starting 4 cycles of XELOX regimen (capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 bid*14d&#xD;
      + oxaliplatin 130mg/m2, d1, Q21d) in 4-6w after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.Number of subjects: 36 patients. Number of centers: 1 sites ( Fudan University Affiliated&#xD;
      Zhongshan Hospital, which has high volume of gastric operations in China, more than 500 per&#xD;
      year).&#xD;

      Backgrounds:&#xD;
&#xD;
      SHR-1210 is a PD-1 antibody developed by Jiangsu Heng Rui Medicine Co. Nowadays, fifteen&#xD;
      clinical trials of this drug have been conducted in patients with different types of advanced&#xD;
      malignant tumor, including one combined with radiotherapy and three combined with&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Until now, SHR-1210 has exhibited favorable safety in recruited patients.&#xD;
      Incidence rate of SAE is only 1%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several big scale clinical research like POET, RTOG 9904 and TOPGEAR have proofed the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant chemoradiation in treating locally advanced GEJ cancer or&#xD;
      gastric cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical trial will be conducted under Simon's optimal two-stage design. The first stage&#xD;
      needs 15 participants, if ≥1 participants acquire remission, then the study will move on to&#xD;
      the second stage and enroll the rest 21 participants. The total sample size will be 36&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will shut down the study in advance, if situations below happens: 1) 1 treatment related&#xD;
      death, &gt;3 disease progression or &gt;2 hyper-progressive disease happen during the first stage;&#xD;
      2) 2 treatment related death, &gt;6 disease progression or &gt;4 hyper-progressive disease happen&#xD;
      during the whole study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with abnormal autoimmune status, unfavorable body function, factors impeding drug&#xD;
      taking, absorption and metabolism will be excluded. Study participants with disease&#xD;
      progression or severe/ intolerant toxicity during treatment will withdraw the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hyper-progressive disease is defined as 1) progression 2) more than doubled growth rate 3)&#xD;
      tumor volume increase &gt;50% in 2 months after initialing the treatment.&#xD;
