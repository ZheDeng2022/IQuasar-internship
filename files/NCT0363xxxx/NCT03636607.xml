      The aim of this study is to make up for this gap by performing a dynamic scan of 18F-FDG&#xD;
      PET/CT on newly diagnosed patients with liver cancer. The lesions and/or metastases are&#xD;
      performed for biopsy. Pathological and genomic studies are performed. The differences between&#xD;
      tumor images and tissues are compared at the same time. 18F-FDG PET/CT dynamic imaging is&#xD;
      explored in primary liver cancer metastases for the diagnostic value.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatic malignancies have a high incidence rate and can be classified into primary liver&#xD;
      cancer and metastatic liver cancer according to their sources. There are three main types of&#xD;
      primary liver cancer: hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), cholangiocellular carcinoma (CCC), and&#xD;
      mixed hepatocellular carcinoma (both hepatocytes and cholangiolar cells). In recent years,&#xD;
      the incidence and mortality of liver cancer have continued to rise. It has high incidence in&#xD;
      Southeast Asia and Africa, and the number of liver cancer patients in China accounts for 55%&#xD;
      of the world. However, the onset of liver cancer is occult; the degree of malignancy is high,&#xD;
      and the progress rate is fast. Most patients have reached late stage or distant metastases&#xD;
      when diagnosed. Imaging examination is an important method for the diagnosis and monitoring&#xD;
      of liver cancer. The routine imaging examination mainly observed the morphological&#xD;
      characteristics and blood supply changes of the liver lesions. The detection rates of CT and&#xD;
      MRI for liver cancer can reach 81-89% and 50-80%, respectively. However, these imaging&#xD;
      studies have limitations and are vulnerable to local anatomical locations and cannot be used&#xD;
      to assess systemic tumor invasion and biological characteristics. Positron emission&#xD;
      tomography (PET) is a molecular-level imaging technique that utilizes relatively specific&#xD;
      tracers for qualitative and quantitative imaging. The good spatial and density resolutions of&#xD;
      computed tomography (X-ray computed tomography, CT) play an important role in the&#xD;
      localization and qualitative diagnosis of HCC. 18F-FDG PET/CT can provide functional imaging&#xD;
      from the point of view of molecular biology. It not only can understand the tumor invasion of&#xD;
      the whole body, but also has become an important means for qualitative diagnosis, staging,&#xD;
      prognosis and therapeutic evaluation of tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a new imaging technology, 18F-FDG PET/CT plays an increasingly important role in the&#xD;
      diagnosis of primary liver cancer. 18F-FDG PET/CT reflects the glycometabolism of tumor&#xD;
      tissues. The diagnosis of benign and malignant tumors is based on the difference in glucose&#xD;
      metabolism between tumor cells and normal tissues. 18F-FDG is an isomer of glucose and is&#xD;
      involved in the glucose metabolism process. Since it is deoxygenated, it cannot generate&#xD;
      diphosphate hexose, and it cannot participate in the next step of metabolism but remains in&#xD;
      the cell. In the tumor cells, due to the high expression of glucose transporter mRNA, the&#xD;
      glucose transporters Glut-1 and Glut-3 levels are increased; the expression of hexokinase is&#xD;
      increased; the level of glucose-6-phosphatase is down-regulated and other common factors make&#xD;
      the tumor cells' 18F-FDG uptake increased.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous researchers have found 18F-FDG PET/CT unsatisfactory in the diagnosis of HCC,&#xD;
      especially for the diagnosis of HCC with well-differentiated tissue. The researchers also&#xD;
      indicates that 18F-FDG PET/CT is not superior to traditional MRI and CT in the diagnosis of&#xD;
      liver cancer. Combined with the current relevant research, it can be roughly stated that the&#xD;
      positive rate of liver cancer using 18F-FDG PET/CT in diagnosing different grades of tissue&#xD;
      differentiation is only about 50-70%. There appears to be a high uptake of FDG in poorly&#xD;
      differentiated HCC. However, there is no such obvious phenomenon in HCC with medium or&#xD;
      well-differentiated tissue. The PET/CT scans reported in all these documents are based on&#xD;
      conventional static scans, i.e. the image data is based on a static take-up image of the&#xD;
      tracer in tissue obtained at a fixed time point after the injection of 18F-FDG. To improve,&#xD;
      the investigators propose to use dynamic data scanning, which captures the dynamic data of&#xD;
      whole body tissues collected from the moment of injecting 18F-FDG to an hour. Dynamic scans&#xD;
      can provide information on the dynamic changes in tracer metabolism and distribution in&#xD;
      tissues over time, so they provide a richer metabolic and distributional pattern of tumor&#xD;
      foci and metastases than static scans. However, the current domestic and international&#xD;
      research on 18F-FDG PET/CT dynamic scan in the metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma is very&#xD;
      rare. Therefore, the aim of this study is to make up for this gap by performing a dynamic&#xD;
      scan of 18F-FDG PET/CT on newly diagnosed patients with liver cancer. The lesions and/or&#xD;
      metastases are performed for biopsy. Pathological and genomic studies are performed. The&#xD;
      differences between tumor images and tissues are compared at the same time. 18F-FDG PET/CT&#xD;
      dynamic imaging is explored in primary liver cancer metastases for the diagnostic value.&#xD;
