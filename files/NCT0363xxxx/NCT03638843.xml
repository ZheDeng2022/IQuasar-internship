  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rapid metabolic improvements seen with sleeve gastrectomy are likely a result of changes in&#xD;
      gastric origin. The gastric mucosa is an endocrine organ that regulates satiation pathways&#xD;
      and is a complex regulator of food intake as well as lipid and glucose metabolism. This study&#xD;
      aims to assess the efficacy and safety of endoscopic selective gastric mucosal devitalization&#xD;
      (GMD) for the management of obesity and its related comorbidities.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopic approaches to obesity may help fulfill the unmet need of over half the US adult&#xD;
      population that would benefit from therapy for obesity but are not receiving it. Endoscopic&#xD;
      approaches to obesity have the potential to be more efficacious than antiobesity medications&#xD;
      and have a lower risk-cost profile compared with bariatric surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endoscopic approaches to obesity need to be increasingly modeled on the proposed mechanisms&#xD;
      contributing to the benefits of bariatric surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators seek to decipher if the gastric mucosa is an independent regulator of food&#xD;
      intake, body weight, lipid and glucose metabolism and serum gut hormones. The investigators&#xD;
      also wish to ascertain if selective devitalization of the gastric mucosa, without alteration&#xD;
      in gastric volume, will improve obesity related comorbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be divided into 3 parts. The purpose of completing the 3 phases is to develop&#xD;
      a minimally invasive weight loss technique that is effective, safe and ready for more&#xD;
      rigorous assessment via a future randomized control trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the efficacy and safety of gastric mucosal devitalization for the management of&#xD;
      obesity and its related comorbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims to confirm that the optimal color of the tissue identified by part 1 corresponds to&#xD;
      selective mucosal devitalization in the in vivo setting by histopathologic examination. For&#xD;
      this, patients will be enrolled in the study after being scheduled to undergo vertical sleeve&#xD;
      gastrectomy (VSG). GMD will be performed three days prior to the VSG, and the excised tissue&#xD;
      including devitalized gastric mucosa will be evaluated. The degree and correlation of&#xD;
      devitalization with mucosal discoloration will be assessed.&#xD;
