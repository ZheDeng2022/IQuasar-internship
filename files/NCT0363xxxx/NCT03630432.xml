  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aim to evaluate the impact of a pulmonary rehabilitation (rehab) programme tailored and&#xD;
      delivered to overweight and obese patients with difficult asthma on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Asthma related quality of life (primary outcome) and asthma control (secondary outcome)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Treatment burden and healthcare usage (secondary outcomes)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Physical activity level, exercise tolerance, lung function and inflammation (secondary&#xD;
           outcome)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Anxiety and depression (secondary outcome)&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Eligible individuals will be identified through Difficult Asthma Clinics or ward admissions.&#xD;
      Those wishing to participate will receive an information sheet and be invited to provide&#xD;
      written informed consent prior to commencing the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Visit&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements taken at the baseline visit will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographics - age, gender, smoking history (current, ex, none, years since stopped, pack&#xD;
      years), age at asthma diagnosis, duration of asthma, atopy, co-morbidities&#xD;

&#xD;
      Questionnaires - Medical Research Council (MRC) dyspnoea scale, Asthma Control Questionnaire&#xD;
      (ACQ6), Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression&#xD;
      Scale (HAD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inflammatory - Blood eosinophils, Fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FENO).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lung Function - peak expiratory flow (PEF) (best of 3), Spirometry (pre- and&#xD;
      post-bronchodilator).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise tolerance - 6 minute walk test (6MWT) (practice test and repeat test), Modified Borg&#xD;
      Dyspnoea Scale, pulse oximetry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical Activity - actigraphy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be provided with a Personalized Asthma Management Plan, and Symptoms Diary&#xD;
      that includes SABA use and other healthcare usage (OCS) boosts, unscheduled GP or A+E&#xD;
      attendances, hospital and ICU admissions); inhaler technique will be corrected if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized 1:1 to Group A and Group B. Group A will enter the 8 week&#xD;
      pulmonary rehabilitation arm of the study immediately while Group B will enter the 8 week&#xD;
      usual care arm. Group A will return for Visit 2 and Group B for Visit 1(2) at 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements taken at Visits 1(2), 2. and 3 will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographics - medications (inhaled/nebulised short acting beta2-agonists (SABA), inhaled and&#xD;
      oral corticosteroids etc), healthcare usage (OCS) boosts, unscheduled GP or A+E attendances,&#xD;
      hospital and ICU admissions since last visit), weight, height, and BMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires - MRC dyspnoea scale, Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ6), Asthma Quality of&#xD;
      Life Questionnaire (AQLQ), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inflammatory - Blood eosinophils, Fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FENO).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lung Function - PEF (best of 3), Spirometry (pre- and post-bronchodilator).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise tolerance - 6 minute walk test, Modified Borg Dyspnoea Scale, pulse oximetry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical Activity - actigraphy&#xD;
&#xD;
      After Visit 2, Group A will discontinue pulmonary rehabilitation; Group A will return for&#xD;
      Visit 3 (48 weeks). Group B will enter the 8 week pulmonary rehabilitation arm and return for&#xD;
      Visit 2 at 16 weeks; Group B will return for Visit 3 (56 weeks). Visits will be postponed by&#xD;
      4 weeks in the event of exacerbation or respiratory infection. Throughout the study period&#xD;
      changes to asthma medications will be allowed as clinically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmonary rehabilitation arm&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pulmonary rehabilitation course will be provided on a rolling basis and for each&#xD;
      individual will be of 8 weeks duration including once weekly, 1.5 hour hospital sessions and&#xD;
      encouragement to perform twice weekly home exercise sessions. Hospital sessions will include&#xD;
      1 hour of supervised exercise and 30 minutes education. Hospital sessions will run in Glasgow&#xD;
      Royal Infirmary every Thursday morning with education (11:15-11:45) and exercise&#xD;
      (12:00-13:00). Sessions will run with minimum 6 participants and aiming for 12-16.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise Component: This will include a combination of aerobic, resistance and flexibility&#xD;
      training. Participants will be screened prior to commencing exercise to confirm stability of&#xD;
      asthma. Pre-exercise administration of bronchodilators (participant's own salbutamol inhaler)&#xD;
      will occur and there will a gradual warm-up with stretches for 7 to 8 minutes. The prescribed&#xD;
      training intensity will be defined by the exercise capacity during baseline 6MWT with&#xD;
      progressive increase in repetitions. Nebulised salbutamol will be available in the venue.&#xD;
      Individuals will then rotate through the following exercises:&#xD;
&#xD;
      12 leg extensions alternating right/left (R/L) +/- weights 12 arm weights (R/L together) 12&#xD;
      step ups Bike 12 Sit to stands 12 pole raises 12 knee lifts (alternating R/L) Walk&#xD;
&#xD;
      Educational Component: This will include the following topics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      What is asthma - and relation to physical activity Medications in asthma Recognizing warning&#xD;
      signs, self management and personalized asthma action plans Inhaler technique and PEF&#xD;
      recording Co-morbidities and asthma Dysfunctional breathing and breathing control exercises&#xD;
      Anxiety management Relaxation Chest clearance Health promotion - smoking cessation, healthy&#xD;
      eating etc Benefits of exercise and maintenance&#xD;
&#xD;
      On completion of the formal pulmonary rehabilitation course, participants will be encouraged&#xD;
      to continue regular exercise sessions by accessing community based &quot;Vitality Classes&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Usual care arm&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this 8 week period, individuals will be asked not to alter their physical activity&#xD;
      level from baseline, and to continue their pre-study asthma management.&#xD;
