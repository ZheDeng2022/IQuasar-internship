  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Arsenicosis is a massive public health hazard in Bangladesh. Prolonged consumption of water&#xD;
      containing high concentration arsenic leads to arsenicosis which is characterized by&#xD;
      dermatological features i.e. diffuse melanosis , spotted melanosis and keratosis. Cock's comb&#xD;
      is rich in hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulfate A, B, C and heparin. Hyaluronic acid is a&#xD;
      hydrophilic molecules and is a constituent of wound extracellular matrix and facilitate wound&#xD;
      healing.This work is aimed to identify the component that is effective in palmar arsenical&#xD;
      keratosis.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Groundwater contamination caused by inorganic arsenic is a massive public health hazard in&#xD;
      Bangladesh. Prolonged consumption of water containing high concentration arsenic leads to&#xD;
      chronic arsenic poisoning which is characterized by dermatological features i.e. diffuse&#xD;
      melanosis followed by spotted melanosis hyperpigmentation and keratosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Until now there is no internationally accepted treatment for arsenical keratosis. Some&#xD;
      authors suggest long-term administration of vitamin and mineral and topical application of&#xD;
      salicylic acid, propylene glycol and neem may be effective. Cock's comb extract contains&#xD;
      hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulfates A, B and C, heparin, hexosamine and water. Study with&#xD;
      cock's comb extract in the treatment of arsenical keratosis was done in the Department of&#xD;
      Pharmacology, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University and was found effective. Therefore,&#xD;
      the purpose of this study will be identification of compound isolated from cock's comb and&#xD;
      its effect on palmar arsenical keratosis. After obtaining Institutional review board&#xD;
      clearance, on the basis of inclusion and exclusion criteria, 40 patients with moderate to&#xD;
      severe palmar arsenical keratosis will be enrolled from arsenic affected area located at&#xD;
      Kamalla Union of Muradnagar Upazilla, Comilla. The study will be open phase II clinical&#xD;
      trial. After enrollment, patients will be informed about the purpose as well as harmful and&#xD;
      beneficial effects of the study. Informed written consent, detail history, clinical&#xD;
      examination, photographs of the palm and water and nail samples will be collected before&#xD;
      starting recruitment to confirm arsenicosis. For identification of compound present in the&#xD;
      cock's comb thin layer chromatography and nuclear magnetic resonance will be done. Cytotoxic&#xD;
      effects of the cock's comb extract will be analyzed by using brine shrimp assay. Cream will&#xD;
      be prepared from cock's comb extract and supplied to the patient at an interval of 2 weeks to&#xD;
      apply on palmar keratotic nodule with clean fingertip by rubbing gently at night for 12&#xD;
      weeks. Adherence of the cream and side effects will be monitored routinely through phone and&#xD;
      during visit at field level. Improvement will be assessed by measuring the palmar keratotic&#xD;
      nodular size with the help of slide calipers. The mean score of the nodular size before and&#xD;
      after treatment will be done. Statistical analysis will be conducted by paired t test. The&#xD;
      result will be presented in tabulated forms and bar diagrams.&#xD;
