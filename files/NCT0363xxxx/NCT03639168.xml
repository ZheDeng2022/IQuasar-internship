  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adenoid cystic carcinomas (ACCs) constitute of 1% of head and neck cancers. This type of&#xD;
      tumor grows slowly with a high potential of local recurrence. Approximately 50% of patients&#xD;
      develop distant metastases, and 33% patients die within 2 years. The initial therapy of these&#xD;
      malignancies consists of surgical resection followed by radiotherapy. Systemic therapy is&#xD;
      crucial in the management of recurrent and metastatic disease. However, nowadays, there were&#xD;
      no standard chemoimmunotherapy regimes. Previous report showed that overall response rate was&#xD;
      only less than 10% using single-agent chemotherapies, and the best results were achieved by&#xD;
      cisplatin. Chidamide is a new benzamide class of histone deacetylase inhibitor with marked&#xD;
      antitumor activity. And a phase I study has showed that one of three patients with&#xD;
      submandibular adenoid cystic carcinoma achieved a partial response treated with Chidamide.&#xD;
      The investigators conducted this study to evaluate the efficacy of Chidamide combined with&#xD;
      cisplatin in recurrent or metastatic head and neck adenoid cystic carcinoma, in order to find&#xD;
      a potential promising way to treat this kind of disease.&#xD;
