  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A large proportion of patients with ABI have cognitive deficits that affect the way they&#xD;
      communicate. Cognitive difficulties with attention, memory, executive functions and so on&#xD;
      affect social communication. Without successful social skills, a person may engage in&#xD;
      conflicts, become isolated and be denied access to social and vocational opportunities.&#xD;
      Internationally, several group interventions have been developed for treating social&#xD;
      communication difficulties during the last years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group Interactive Structured Treatment (GIST) is a validated holistic multidisciplinary group&#xD;
      treatment targeting social communication skills after traumatic brain injury. The main aim of&#xD;
      the present study is to examine the efficacy of GIST for improving social communication in&#xD;
      persons with acquired brain injury, including TBI, stroke, tumor ect. Secondary the study&#xD;
      aims to compare the standard GIST protocol to an newly developed intensive GIST protocol.&#xD;
      Efficacy will be assessed immediately after intervention, but also three and six months after&#xD;
      the intervention. The project is in line with international research efforts aimed to&#xD;
      establish more knowledge about group treatment for persons with social communication&#xD;
      disorders after ABI.&#xD;

    <measure>La Trobe Questionnaire.</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The LaTrobe Communication Questionnaire (LCQ) is a 30-item questionnaire that measures communication ability, a subjective outcome measure. Various communication behaviours are rated on a 4-point scale: 1¼never or rarely, 2¼sometimes, 3¼often and 4¼usually or always, but six items require a reverse in the scoring. Higher scores reflect reduced communications skills. The tool was developed to obtain information from various sources (e.g. self -rating by individual with TBI, rating by support person).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Profile of Pragmatic Impairment in Communication (PPIC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>PPIC is an objective measure of social communication skills designed specifically for use with people with TBI. It includes 10 feature summary scales that assess communication skills on a 6-point scale from normative (0) to very severely impaired (5), with lower scores indicating better performance. These summary scales-logical content; general participation; quantity; quality; internal relation; external relation; clarity of expression; social style; subject matter; and aesthetics.</description>

    <measure>Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS) is a flexible system of measuring outcome goals, based on a 5-point scale.&#xD;
Levels of goal attainment are expressed objectively in terms of concrete behaviors that can be observed and recorded.</description>

Various executive behaviours are rated on a 3-point scale.</description>

    <measure>Social competence checklist</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Is an interview where the participant and close family member answer 6 yes or no answers regarding the participants social communication skills. The interview is found in the GIST protocol developed by Hawley and Newman 2002.</description>

    <measure>CIQ (Community Integration Questionnaire)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Community Integration Questionnaire (CIQ) is a community integration outcome measure developed for TBI subjects; its social integration and productivity subscales were used for this study. Frequency of such activities as shopping, leisure pursuits, visiting friends or relatives, travel, and one's work, school, or volunteer situation, are scored on a 15-item scale; a higher score indicates greater integration.</description>
