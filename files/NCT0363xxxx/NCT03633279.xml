    <textblock>
      Sarcopenia is defined as loss of skeletal muscle mass. In cirrhosis, due to impaired urea&#xD;
      genesis and decreased hepatic ammonia disposal, the skeletal muscle functions as a metabolic&#xD;
      partner for the liver. The proportion of patients with sarcopenia is higher in those with&#xD;
      alcoholic liver cirrhosis (80%) compared to cirrhosis due to other etiologies (31%-71%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sarcopenia is prevalent in &gt; 50% patients with Child C cirrhosis. Sarcopenia increases the&#xD;
      risk for severe infections in patients with cirrhosis. Adequate amino acid supply is needed&#xD;
      for appropriate antibody and cytokine responses, that is impaired when skeletal muscle mass.&#xD;
      The sepsis-related mortality rates in patients with and without sarcopenia are 22% and 8%,&#xD;
      respectively (P = 0.02). In patients with liver cirrhosis is protein-calorie malnutrition,&#xD;
      leading to severe consequences to the general state and clinical evolution of the patient.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Globally, the mortality after any infection in cirrhosis patients is very high. The&#xD;
      cumulative mortality in patients with infections was 43.5% (11,987 patients) where as the&#xD;
      mortality rate without infection was 13.6% (2317 patients). Over the years, variceal bleeding&#xD;
      causing death in cirrhosis has declined substantially but there has been no improvement in&#xD;
      infection causing mortality over several decades. It adversely affects clinical outcomes&#xD;
      including survival, quality of life, development of other complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiological image analysis is currently used to diagnose sarcopenia in cirrhosis. The&#xD;
      European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People and Wilson D et al, recommend using the&#xD;
      presence of both low muscle mass and low muscle function (strength or performance) for the&#xD;
      diagnosis of sarcopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cirrhosis is believed to be a state of anabolic resistance and standard replacement of&#xD;
      nutrients are generally ineffective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with cirrhosis frequently show protein and energy deficiency. Protein deficiency&#xD;
      leads to hypoalbuminemia, inducing ascites and edema, whereas energy deficiency decreases fat&#xD;
      and muscle mass and causes muscle weakness, decreasing the quality of life of patients with&#xD;
      cirrhosis. Moreover, in patients with advanced chronic liver disease, Branched Chain Amino&#xD;
      acids concentrations are low, whereas the concentrations of aromatic amino acids such as&#xD;
      phenylalanine and tyrosine are high, conditions that may be closely associated with hepatic&#xD;
      encephalopathy and the prognosis of these patients. The survival rate of patients with&#xD;
      sarcopenia liver cirrhosis has been found to be significantly lower than that of&#xD;
      non-sarcopenia cirrhotic patients. Long-term Branched Chain Amino acids supplementation&#xD;
      significantly raises the survival rate in sarcopenia liver cirrhosis but not in&#xD;
      non-sarcopenia liver cirrhosis showed that sarcopenia was associated with mortality in&#xD;
      patients undergoing Live Donor Liver Transplantation, and perioperative nutritional therapy&#xD;
      significantly improved overall survival in patients with sarcopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been reported that the longer the duration on a waiting list for liver&#xD;
      transplantation, the more sarcopenia the patient has become, even though their Model for&#xD;
      End-stage Liver Disease scores stay the same. Patients in an advanced state of sarcopenia are&#xD;
      confronted by their vulnerability to infection, and ultimately their imminent death. Patients&#xD;
      with sarcopenia tended to have postoperative complications, especially infectious&#xD;
      complications. Studies differ on the effect of of Sarcopenia on post transplant mortality.&#xD;
      Montano-Loza et al reported that patients with &quot;extreme&quot; sarcopenia exhibited significantly&#xD;
      worse prognosis. Nevertheless, patients with severe sarcopenia must have worse prognoses&#xD;
      because of the vulnerability to infectious problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main immunosuppressants used in liver transplant recipients are calcineurin inhibitors.&#xD;
      Although liver transplant recipients usually gain weight after transplantation, that gain is&#xD;
      mainly caused by the accumulation of fat, while skeletal muscle mass rather decreases. The&#xD;
      state of sarcopenia rather worsen after liver transplantation. reported that sarcopenia&#xD;
      continued to be a risk factor for mortality even in patients who managed to survive their&#xD;
      early post transplant periods. Because sarcopenia continues, or rather worsens in some&#xD;
      recipients, after liver transplantation, their vulnerability to infections, frailty syndrome&#xD;
      in general, caused by sarcopenia should be seriously cautioned in addition to the problems&#xD;
      relating to immunosuppressants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With regard to nutritional intervention for sarcopenia, Branched Chain Amino acids&#xD;
      supplementation is vital because Branched Chain Amino acids are an essential amino acid&#xD;
      substrate for protein synthesis and energy generation in skeletal muscles. Branched Chain&#xD;
      Amino acids are a group of three essential amino acids comprising valine, leucine and&#xD;
      isoleucine; these account for 35% of the essential amino acids in skeletal muscle proteins.&#xD;
      In patients with liver cirrhosis, Branched Chain Amino acids is not only a substrate of&#xD;
      protein synthesis and ammonia detoxification, but is also a source of energy for the skeletal&#xD;
      muscles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the consumption of Branched Chain Amino acids by skeletal muscle is accelerated in&#xD;
      Liver Cirrhosis, leading to muscle protein breakdown, and resulting in sarcopenia As an&#xD;
      effect on cirrhotic patients, Branched Chain Amino acids supplementation has been&#xD;
      demonstrated to improve Protein Energy Malnutrition, raise serum albumin levels, and&#xD;
      subsequently improve quality of life and prognosis The possible effect of Branched Chain&#xD;
      Amino acids on sarcopenia is that leucine primarily activates the mammalian target of&#xD;
      rapamycin signaling pathway involved in muscle protein synthesis, and additionally stimulates&#xD;
      the pancreatic β cells to release insulin, which has an anabolic effect in skeletal muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study demonstrated that Branched Chain Amino acids supplementation significantly&#xD;
      improves the prognosis of sarcopenia liver cirrhosis, but its direct effect on sarcopenia&#xD;
      itself remains unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several clinical trials have suggested that Branched Chain Amino acids supplementation&#xD;
      improves the prognosis of cirrhotic patients. For example, a multicenter randomized trial&#xD;
      from Italy showed that oral Branched Chain Amino acids supplementation in patients with&#xD;
      advanced cirrhosis prevented progressive hepatic failure and improved surrogate markers and&#xD;
      perceived health status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard of care for nutrition in patients with liver cirrhosis are as follows -&#xD;
      Nutritional recommendations target the optimal supply of adequate substrates related to&#xD;
      requirements linked to energy, protein, carbohydrates, lipids, vitamins and minerals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these basic observations, patients with advanced chronic liver disease have been&#xD;
      treated clinically with Branched Chain Amino acids-rich medicines, with positive effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Branched Chain Amino acids will complement frequent feeding with late evening snacks in&#xD;
      reversing muscle loss in cirrhosis. The diet combined with resistance exercises shall&#xD;
      increase skeletal muscle mass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical and laboratory Assessment Complete medical record regarding the cirrhosis, its&#xD;
      aetiology, complications and co-morbidities will be noted. Liver Function test, Renal&#xD;
      function test, Prothrombin time/international normalized ratio will be recorded. The severity&#xD;
      of cirrhosis will be assessed using the Child- Pugh score and the Model of End Stage Liver&#xD;
      Disease score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testing- Assessment of sarcopenia&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will participate in the following 4 procedures to measure sarcopenia:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. L3 Skeletal Muscle Index Skeletal muscle area derived from a single slice CT has become&#xD;
           more easily reproducible, and reduces the radiation exposure required to only 2.6&#xD;
           millisieverts. Measuring cross-sectional muscle area at either the level of the third&#xD;
           (L3) or fourth (L4) lumbar vertebrae has been shown to correlate well with total body&#xD;
           muscle mass (r = 0.71). When adjusted for patient height to take stature into account it&#xD;
           is referred to as skeletal muscle index. Skeletal muscle index will be calculated from&#xD;
           Slice-O-matic software, version 5 (Tomovision), Montreal, QC, Canada). Skeletal muscle&#xD;
           index has been shown to be of higher accuracy in the diagnosis of sarcopenia in&#xD;
           cirrhosis than anthropometry or dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scanning and is&#xD;
           now the most commonly employed method in studies investigating sarcopenia in cirrhosis.&#xD;
           Diagnostic criteria have been extrapolated from Western cirrhosis populations. Multiple&#xD;
           studies in cirrhosis, which have employed this definition, have produced clinically&#xD;
           meaningful results and it is increasingly accepted as the most appropriate definition of&#xD;
           sarcopenia when using cross-sectional imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Muscle strength:It is assessed by grip strength and measured using a Jamar dynamometer.&#xD;
           The summary of measures are as follow.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Posture Subject seated Arm position Shoulders adducted and neutrally rotated, elbow&#xD;
           flexed at 90°, forearm in neutral Wrist position Wrist between 0 and 30° of dorsiflexion&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The participant will be allowed to perform one test trial. After this, three trials&#xD;
           followed and the best score was used for analysis. Handgrip strength will be expressed&#xD;
           in kilogram's (Kg). Three trials for each hand will be carried out and the highest value&#xD;
           for diagnosing sarcopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Muscle Performance [Gait Speed Test (4-metre)]:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The test can be performed with any patient able to walk 4 meters using the instructions&#xD;
      below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Instruct the patient to walk at their normal pace. Patients may use an assistive device,&#xD;
           if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Ask the patient to walk down a hallway through a 1-metre zone for acceleration, a&#xD;
           central 4-metre &quot;testing&quot; zone, and a 1-metre zone for deceleration (the patient should&#xD;
           not start to slow down before the 4-metre mark).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Start the timer with the first footfall after the 0-metre line of the testing zone&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Stop the timer with the first footfall after the 4-metre line of the testing zone&#xD;
&#xD;
      SCORING: Gait speed of longer than 5 seconds to walk 4 meters (&lt;0.8 m/s) suggests an&#xD;
      increased risk of poor muscle performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Muscle Performance-The chair stand test is a physical performance test used to assess&#xD;
      lower-extremity function. A 5 repetition test is a measure of strength; a 10 repetition test&#xD;
      is a measure of strength and endurance. Equipment/Set Up Use a standard chair with arms and&#xD;
      with a seat height of approximately 17 inches for all assessments, regardless of the height&#xD;
      of the subject. Place the back of the chair against a wall to prevent movement during the&#xD;
      test. Procedure Instruct and demonstrate the following protocol before asking the subject to&#xD;
      perform the test:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sit as far back as possible in the chair seat. Keep feet firmly planted on the floor&#xD;
           approximately hip width apart and the back of lower legs away from the chair. Keep knees&#xD;
           bent at a 90-degree angle with arms crossed over the chest. (An individual of average or&#xD;
           taller height will be able to sit with their upper back against the back of the chair.&#xD;
           Individuals of shorter than average height will not be able to touch the chair back&#xD;
           while maintaining proper position and are not required to touch the chair back during&#xD;
           testing).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stand up one time and sit down, returning completely to the correct starting position.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Indicate that any chair stands done with improper technique, e.g. not standing all the&#xD;
           way up, not sitting all the way back, lifting feet off the floor, etc. will not be&#xD;
           counted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Allow the participant the opportunity to try one chair stand to be sure when they stand&#xD;
           up the back of their legs are not touching the chair.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Instruct the subject that the timed assessment will begin on the command, &quot;Ready, Set,&#xD;
           Go&quot; and that they are to stand up and sit back down 5 times as quickly and safely as&#xD;
           possible. At the command &quot;Ready, Set, Go&quot; the tester begins timing by starting the&#xD;
           stopwatch.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Count each chair stand out loud when the subject is in the standing position. Provide&#xD;
           continuous verbal encouragement during the test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the tenth repetition click the stopwatch off while participant is in the standing&#xD;
           position.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Conduct two trials, separated by three minutes. If subjects are unable to stand up one&#xD;
           time without assistance than they can use their hands to assist them in rising and&#xD;
           returning to the seated position while following all other procedures as described&#xD;
           above. Make sure to note that hands were used when recording the assessment data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normative value of Sarcopenia indices and association of Sarcopenia indices and mortality in&#xD;
      child C cirrhosis patients will be also calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up Three months after randomization, data will be collected on the 4 objective indices&#xD;
      of sarcopenia, as outlined above.In addition, event free survival, number of&#xD;
      hospitalisations, combined liver events (variceal bleeds, ascites , Hepato-renal syndrome,&#xD;
      Overt Hepatic encephalopathy, Septic complications - Pneumonias, Urinary Tract Infection,&#xD;
      spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, skin infections and septic shock) and Quality of Life&#xD;
      (assessed using SF 36 questionnaire) will also be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring for Adverse Events:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Branched Chain Amino acids did not increase the risk of serious adverse events, but was&#xD;
      associated with nausea and diarrhoea. Any adverse event will be recorded specifying the time&#xD;
      of onset, the duration, the severity and the relationship to the test medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: The primary objective is to show the superiority of Branched Chain Amino acids&#xD;
      (experimental arm) versus placebo to improve both the muscle mass and muscle strength&#xD;
      (co-primary endpoint) after 3 month of treatment in patients with sarcopeniacirrhosis (Child&#xD;
      C) treated with standard nutrition and exercises. The co-primary endpoint is the 3-month&#xD;
      change in CT Skeletal muscle index and Hand Grip Strength (i.e difference between the&#xD;
      baseline and 3 month values). The study success will be only declared if both primary&#xD;
      endpoints are statistically significant in favor of the experimental arm at two-sided&#xD;
      significant level of 0.05. The sample size will determined as the maximum value of the sample&#xD;
      sizes separately calculated for each endpoint with a 90% power for each comparison&#xD;
      (considering independence between the two primary outcome as conservative approach) in order&#xD;
      to guarantee a power of 0.80 to show the treatment efficacy on both primary outcomes. As&#xD;
      analyzing the changes or values at 3 months are equivalent since the primary analysis will be&#xD;
      adjusted for baseline values,Investigator determined the sample size using the 3-month values&#xD;
      for each primary endpoints obtained in a study carried out in our center. In control arm,&#xD;
      Investigator expect a mean CT Skeletal muscle index of 45.4±5.9 at 3-months and Mean Hand&#xD;
      Grip Strength of 33.7+9. Compared to placebo Investigator expect that Branched Chain Amino&#xD;
      acids will be associated with an increasing in 10% in mean value of CT Skeletal muscle index&#xD;
      (i.e. an absolute mean difference of 4.5) and with an increasing in 20% in mean value of Hand&#xD;
      Grip Strength (i.e. an absolute mean difference of 6.7). With a two-sided test (alpha=5%,&#xD;
      power=90%), 38 patients per arm will be required to detect the effect size on CT Skeletal&#xD;
      muscle index (assuming a standard deviation of 5.9) and 45 per arm to detect the effect size&#xD;
      on Hand Grip Strength (assuming a standard deviation of 9.6). Thus, a total of 90 patients&#xD;
      will be required. To account for an anticipated attrition rate of 20%, a total of 114&#xD;
      patients will be included and randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Plan Statistical analyses will be independently performed by the&#xD;
      Biostatistics Department of University of Lille under the responsibility of Professor Alain&#xD;
      Duhamel. Data will be analyzed using the SAS software (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC, USA) and&#xD;
      all statistical tests will be performed with a 2-tailed alpha risk of 0.05. A detailed&#xD;
      statistical analysis plan will be written and finalized prior to the database lock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All analyses will be performed for all randomized patients based on their original group of&#xD;
      randomization, regardless of the treatment they actually received, study eligibility, or&#xD;
      compliance post randomization, according to the intention-to-treat principle. Nis planned&#xD;
      Baseline characteristics will be described for each arm. Quantitative variables will be&#xD;
      expressed as mean (standard deviation), median (interquartile range) and range. Qualitative&#xD;
      variables will be expressed as frequencies and percentages. Normality of distribution will be&#xD;
      assessed graphically and using the Shapiro-Wilk test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Co-Primary outcome The change in CT Skeletal muscle index and Hand Grip Strength from&#xD;
      baseline to 3 months will be estimated and compared between the 2 arms using the constrained&#xD;
      longitudinal data analysis model that was proposed by Liang and Zeger. The constrained&#xD;
      longitudinal data analysis model will be used for its potential advantages compared to a&#xD;
      conventional longitudinal analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model. In the constrained&#xD;
      longitudinal data analysis, both the baseline and post baseline values are modeled as&#xD;
      dependent variables using a linear mixed model (an unstructured covariance pattern model),&#xD;
      and the true baseline means are constrained to be the same for the 2 treatment arms. Hence,&#xD;
      the constrained longitudinal data analysis provides an adjustment for observed baseline&#xD;
      differences in estimating treatment effects, using all available baseline and post-baseline&#xD;
      values. The mean between-group difference (with a 95% confidence interval(CI)) in the 3-month&#xD;
      change in CT Skeletal muscle index and Hand Grip Strength (BCAA vs. placebo) will be&#xD;
      estimated as an effect size with the time-by-group interaction. If normality of the model&#xD;
      residuals is not satisfied, nonparametric analysis will be used; absolute changes between&#xD;
      baseline and 3-month visits will be calculated and compared between the 2 arms using a&#xD;
      non-parametric analysis of covariance that is adjusted for baseline values. The efficacy of&#xD;
      Branched chain amino acids will be declared only if the comparison in both primary outcome is&#xD;
      significant at p&lt;0.05 (two-sided test).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Missing values in CT Skeletal muscle index and Hand Grip Strength measures will be handled&#xD;
      with a multiple imputation procedure. Missing data will be imputed under the missing at&#xD;
      random assumption (whatever the reason for missing data) by using regression switching&#xD;
      approach (a chained equation with m=20 imputations), with the predictive mean matching method&#xD;
      for continuous variables, and logistic regression models (binary, ordinal or polynomial) for&#xD;
      categorical variables. The imputation procedure will be performed using main baseline&#xD;
      characteristics and allocated arm. Treatment effect estimates that are obtained from multiple&#xD;
      imputed data sets will be combined using Rubin's rules. Sensitivity analyses will be&#xD;
      conducted on the observed data (case-complete analysis) and in per-protocol population. The&#xD;
      per-protocol population will include all randomised patients who remain eligible for the&#xD;
      study and will be 80% compliant to the allocated treatment. Any patients who will withdraw&#xD;
      from the trial or treatment or who will not receive the allocated treatment will be excluded&#xD;
      for per-protocol population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes The same strategy employed to analyze the co-primary outcome will be used&#xD;
      to compare the 3-month change in muscle performance (Measured by change in Chair Stand and&#xD;
      Gait Velocity) and the 3-month change in SF 36 - patient-reported outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3-month event-free survival will be estimated using Kaplan-Meier method treating death or&#xD;
      complications of cirrhosis as a combined events. The treatment effect will be estimated by&#xD;
      calculating Hazard ratio (HR) and its 95% CI by using a Cox proportional hazards regression&#xD;
      model including centers as random effect (frailty model). The proportional hazards assumption&#xD;
      will be assessed by plotting the scaled Schoenfeld residuals of treatment effect against the&#xD;
      rank of survival time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events will be analyzed using descriptive analysis.&#xD;
