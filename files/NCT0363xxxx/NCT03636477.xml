  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study involves an investigational product: Ad-RTS-hIL-12 given with veledimex&#xD;
      for production of human IL-12. IL-12 is a protein that can improve the body's natural&#xD;
      response to disease by enhancing the ability of the immune system to kill tumor cells and may&#xD;
      interfere with blood flow to the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nivolumab is an antibody (a kind of human protein) that is being tested to see if it will&#xD;
      allow the body's immune system to work against glioblastoma tumors. Opdivo (Nivolumab) is&#xD;
      currently FDA approved in the United States for melanoma (a type of skin cancer), non-small&#xD;
      cell lung cancer, renal cell cancer (a type of kidney cancer), Hodgkin's lymphoma but is not&#xD;
      approved in glioblastoma. Nivolumab may help your immune system detect and attack cancer&#xD;
      cells. Ad-RTS-hIL-12 and veledimex will be given in combination with Nivolumab to enhance the&#xD;
      IL-12 mediated effect observed to date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main purpose of this substudy is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single&#xD;
      tumoral injection of Ad-RTS-hIL-12 given with oral veledimex in combination with nivolumab.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible patients will receive one dose of nivolumab, via infusion, one week prior to&#xD;
      standard of care craniotomy and tumor resection (subtotal or total). On the day of surgery,&#xD;
      patients will receive one dose of veledimex before the resection procedure. Ad-RTS-hIL-12&#xD;
      will be administered by free-hand injection. Patients will continue on oral veledimex for 14&#xD;
      days. Following veledimex, patients will receive nivolumab via infusion every two weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is divided into three periods: the screening period, the treatment period and the&#xD;
      follow-up period.&#xD;
