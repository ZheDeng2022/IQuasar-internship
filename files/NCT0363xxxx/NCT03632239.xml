      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genes tell a person s body how to grow and work. All people have variations in their genes.&#xD;
      Some of these cause differences that show up in a person s traits or their health. Others do&#xD;
      not. Researchers want to gather more data on people based on their genes. They want to use&#xD;
      this data to learn more about diseases and possible treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To develop a group of people and their genetic data who can be contacted again for&#xD;
      phenotyping. To share those data with other researchers and make them searchable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People already enrolled in a wide variety of protocols. They will be of varying health&#xD;
      status, age, and gender. They will have had or plan to have exome or genome sequencing under&#xD;
      their protocol. They can be re-contacted by the research team for possible other studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will give basic details like contact and demographic information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may answer questions about their personal health history, their family medical&#xD;
      history, or their thoughts or reactions to data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have basic health tests. Their height, weight, or blood pressure may be&#xD;
      checked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have tests of heart function. They may have an ultrasound or other&#xD;
      non-invasive test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may provide blood, urine, or other samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have scans or other tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get the results of all clinical tests in a letter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If any tests are abnormal, someone from the study will call the participant to explain what&#xD;
      the results mean and what to do about them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get genetic testing results only if researchers think they could affect the&#xD;
      health of the participant or their relatives.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The Genomic Ascertainment Cohort (TGAC) will be a large cohort of individuals with sequence&#xD;
      data unselected for any specific phenotype. TGAC will enable the study of genetic disease&#xD;
      while minimizing the bias of phenotypic ascertainment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TGAC will have a two-tiered system of participation. Tier 1 will be individuals who have&#xD;
      undergone or consented for exome or genome sequencing under separate studies and consented to&#xD;
      data sharing and re-contact by the research team. Sequencing data from all participants will&#xD;
      be aggregated to form the Shared Genomic Ascertainment Cohort (SGAC) which will be available&#xD;
      to NIH investigators and extramural investigators participating in TGAC via a genome browser,&#xD;
      such that it is de-identified and visible as unlinked aggregate genotypes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will be able to use the genome browser to select genetic variants of interest&#xD;
      and formulate hypotheses. Investigators will apply to the TGAC program with a scientific&#xD;
      proposal describing the phenotyping that is requested. These proposals will be reviewed and&#xD;
      prioritized by the TGAC scientific advisory committee (SAC). The TGAC staff will then&#xD;
      facilitate re-contact and sample collection and/or phenotypic studies on individuals based on&#xD;
      genetic variants of interest. These individuals will be offered Tier 2 participation via an&#xD;
      investigator s own protocol or via the Genomic Ascertainment Phenotyping Program (GAPP). The&#xD;
      GAPP will include the ability to perform basic, non-invasive phenotypic studies using the&#xD;
      NIHCC. The GAPP will return results from clinical tests performed and will also be able to&#xD;
      return sequence variants deemed clinically relevant and validated in a CLIA-certified lab.&#xD;
      The specific phenotyping will depend on the nature of the hypothesis regarding the genetic&#xD;
      variant or variants of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SGAC will initially consist of genome or exome sequence data from approximately 8,000&#xD;
      individuals from the ITMI longitudinal study and NHGRI s ClinSeq (Registered Traemark) study&#xD;
      (Biesecker et al., 2009), with planned increases in sample size as additional cohorts are&#xD;
      added to the shared cohort. We anticipate approximately 200 individuals from SGAC will be&#xD;
      enrolled into Tier 2 participation in the first year after establishment of TGAC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a data resource, there are no predefined outcome measures. We expect TGAC to generate&#xD;
      hypotheses regarding phenotypic consequence of genetic variants and enable the study of such&#xD;
      hypotheses without the limits of traditional phenotype-first genetic research.&#xD;
