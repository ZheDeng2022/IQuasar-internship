  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A single-site, prospective, observational clinical study of Cytal® Wound Matrix alone or in&#xD;
      combination with MicroMatrix® for the management of wounds. Up to 100 patients with multiple&#xD;
      wound types including but not limited to, venous ulcers, diabetic foot ulcers, trauma wounds,&#xD;
      and external surgical wounds will be treated either with Cytal® Wound Matrix alone or with&#xD;
      Cytal® Wound Matrix and MicroMatrix® for wounds exceeding 3mm in depth. Wound healing&#xD;
      efficacy, effect of treatment on patient-reported quality of life, complete wound management,&#xD;
      wound-related adverse event, and wound pathology will be measured. The protocol defined&#xD;
      patient follow-up is 12 months.&#xD;

    <description>VAS is a psychometric response scale that measures subjective characteristics or attitudes regarding perceived pain levels from participants. Participants are asked to draw a line on a 10cm horizontal line indicating what their current pain level would be. The distance between the start of the horizontal line to the vertical line is calculated in mm with a higher score (100mm) indicating a greater pain intensity.</description>

    <description>W-QOL is a 17-item Likert style questionnaire that measures 3 subscales in a participant (Body, Psyche, and Everyday to then calculate an overall global score. An overall global score is obtained from averaging all items. Each item is coded with numbers 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much) with a higher score indicating a lower quality of life.</description>
