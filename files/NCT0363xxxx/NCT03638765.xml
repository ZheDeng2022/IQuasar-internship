  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will use an Ommaya reservoir that drains into brain metastases to deliver&#xD;
      activated, autolous dendritic cells to the tumor lesion, for patients who are 18 - 75 years&#xD;
      old who have brain metastases from either lung cancer or breast cancer. The primary objective&#xD;
      of the study is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of administering DCVax-Direct to&#xD;
      patients with metastatic tumors in the brain. The secondary objectives are to determine tumor&#xD;
      response, the rate of intracranial recurrence (IR), the rate of neurologic deaths, decline in&#xD;
      neuro-cognitive functioning and overall survival. Approximately 10 patients with injectable&#xD;
      metastatic brain tumors will be enrolled initially in a dose escalation scheme, with the&#xD;
      expectation to enroll a total of 24 patients.&#xD;
