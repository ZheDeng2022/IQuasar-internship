      Adequate preoperative fasting is critical in preventing pulmonary aspiration of gastric&#xD;
      content. Ultrasonography is considering as a useful test assessing the volume of gastric&#xD;
      contents, but the emptying time of a rice-based meal (Asian foods) in healthy populations was&#xD;
      not clear. The objective of this study was to investigate the minimum fasting time required&#xD;
      for adequate gastric emptying after the ingestion of a rice-based meal.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aspiration of gastric contents into the lungs in surgical patients is a rare, but serious&#xD;
      adverse event. Because a proper preoperative fasting is mandatory before anesthesia to&#xD;
      prevent this severe complication, patients undergoing elective surgery have traditionally&#xD;
      asked to fast overnight to ensure that their stomachs are empty. However, it is difficult and&#xD;
      uncomfortable for patients not to eat or drink, particularly for those scheduled for surgery&#xD;
      later in the day. Fasting may lead to thirst, hunger, anxiety, and tiredness, along with the&#xD;
      potential for hypoglycemia and dehydration. Moreover, prolonged preoperative starvation&#xD;
      triggers a metabolic response that precipitates gluconeogenesis and increases the organic&#xD;
      response to trauma [7,8] and leads to delayed recovery after surgery. Avoiding inordinate&#xD;
      fasting before surgery markedly reduces postoperative insulin resistance which has beneficial&#xD;
      effects on postoperative glucose and protein metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current guidelines by the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) recommend a minimum of&#xD;
      6 hours after a light meal (toast and clear fluid) and 8 hours if the meal includes fried or&#xD;
      fatty foods. In the era of evidence-based medicine, however, these fasting recommendations to&#xD;
      keep a patient in preoperative fasting of 6-8 hours after the intake of solid meal are&#xD;
      derived from survey opinions solicited from 470 active members of the ASA membership despite&#xD;
      insufficient literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies have shown that real-time ultrasonography can provide reliable information&#xD;
      about the nature (clear fluid, solid, or none) and volume of gastric content, being a&#xD;
      non-invasive, inexpensive and safe method. The ultrasonographic measurement of antral&#xD;
      cross-sectional area (CSA) is used for the assessment of gastric emptying in diabetic or&#xD;
      dyspeptic patients and clinical investigations in obstetrical anesthesia. Thus, we designed&#xD;
      this study to evaluate scientifically the gastric emptying time of solid meal using serial&#xD;
      sonographic assessment in healthy volunteers. (Especially, there was no study to evaluate the&#xD;
      gastric emptying time of a rice-based meal.) The objective of this study was to confirm or&#xD;
      confront the minimum fasting time required for adequate gastric emptying for a rice-based&#xD;
      meal (Asian foods), according to the suggestion of current guideline.&#xD;
