      To investigate the advantages and disadvantages of the anterior transversalis fascia approach&#xD;
      versus the preperitoneal approach for inguinal hernia repair in residents from northern China&#xD;
      regarding common postoperative complications (including acute and chronic pain, wound&#xD;
      infection, rates of wound infection, hematoma, seroma, and hernia recurrence) and severe&#xD;
      postoperative complications.&#xD;

      History and current related studies Inguinal hernia is a common surgical disease that&#xD;
      manifests as protrusion of abdominal cavity contents through the inguinal canal because of an&#xD;
      abdominal wall defect. It is more common in males than in females, with an overall incidence&#xD;
      of 5-10%. Methods for surgical repair of abdominal wall defects in the inguinal region are&#xD;
      classified as either 'tension'repairs or 'tension-free' repairs. Herniorrhaphy through repair&#xD;
      of the posterior wall of the inguinal canal was first described by Bassini in 1887, and is&#xD;
      regarded as a classic surgical method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As understanding of the anatomic location and pathophysical characteristics of inguinal&#xD;
      hernia developed, the American surgeon Lichtenstein proposed a new concept of tension-free&#xD;
      herniorrhaphy. This technique was quickly adopted worldwide because of its advantages&#xD;
      including minimal invasion, technical ease, effectiveness, low complication rate, low&#xD;
      recurrence rate, and allowance of resumption of unrestricted physical activity. The most&#xD;
      common technique is open tension-free herniorrhaphy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many surgical repair methods involving patches (of varying types and materials) are available&#xD;
      for inguinal hernia repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tension-free herniorrhaphy methods include anterior transversalis fascia repair,&#xD;
      preperitoneal repair, abdominal cavity patch repair and combined repair approaches.&#xD;
      Lichtenstein herniorrhaphy is the representative technique of anterior transversalis fascia&#xD;
      repair. Preperitoneal repair techniques include transabdominal preperitoneal, total&#xD;
      extraperitoneal, and Kugel repair techniques. The combined repair approaches refer to&#xD;
      tension-free herniorrhaphy using a modified Kugel patch and the Ultrapro hernia system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are few reports on the effects of different inguinal hernia repair approaches on&#xD;
      postoperative complications, particularly regarding severe postoperative complications, in&#xD;
      patients in northern China. The incidence of severe complications after inguinal hernia&#xD;
      repair is relatively low, but this surgery can lead to physical impairment or organ&#xD;
      dysfunction that greatly decreases patient quality of life and places a heavy burden on the&#xD;
      patient's family and society. At present, there is a scarcity of clinical evidence from&#xD;
      large-sample, randomized, controlled trials investigating the effectiveness of inguinal&#xD;
      hernia repair via the anterior transversalis fascia approach versus the preperitoneal&#xD;
      approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events and serious adverse events (SAE) According to the study protocol and clinical&#xD;
      judgment, AE/SAE occurring after herniorrhaphy will be reported to the Department of General&#xD;
      Surgery, the Fourth Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AE refer to any adverse medical events occurring after herniorrhaphy in patients or clinical&#xD;
      subjects. SAE refer to any adverse postoperative medical events involving one or more of the&#xD;
      following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Death, irrespective of the cause Life-threatening event Severe or permanent disability or&#xD;
      organ dysfunction Hemorrhage Malformation, birth defect Hospitalization or extended hospital&#xD;
      stay Re-admission to hospital Recurrence (symptomatic) of inguinal hernia&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Descriptive statistics will be used to analyze the data. For measurement&#xD;
      data, the number of patients (number of missing patients), mean, median, standard deviation,&#xD;
      first quartile, third quartile, and maximum and minimum will be described, and 95% confidence&#xD;
      intervals will be calculated. For counted data, the frequency and relative numbers will be&#xD;
      described, and 95% confidence intervals will be calculated. According to whether the&#xD;
      differences between scores before and after treatments are normally distributed, the paired&#xD;
      t-test or Wilcoxon signed rank test will be used for comparison of measurement data in the&#xD;
      same group. The chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test will be used for analysis of counted&#xD;
      data, and the Wilcoxon signed rank test will be used for analysis of ranked data. The&#xD;
      last-observation-carried-forward imputation method will be used when the effects-related&#xD;
      visit data at the last visit are missing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Full analysis set According to the intention-to-treat principle, patients who receive at&#xD;
      least one treatment according to study protocol and undergo at least one evaluation regarding&#xD;
      curative effects after baseline evaluation will be included in the full analysis set.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Curative effects analysis Full analysis set analysis of curative effects will be performed.&#xD;
      The proportions of patients with no complications, patients with common complications, and&#xD;
      patients with severe complications within postoperative 3 weeks will be analyzed using&#xD;
      descriptive statistics. The chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test will be used for&#xD;
      comparison of differences between groups. If statistical differences exist between groups,&#xD;
      the Bonferroni method will be used to adjust the α value, and pairwise comparisons will be&#xD;
      made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the change in VAS pain score after treatment meets the normality and homogeneity of&#xD;
      variance, analysis of variance will be performed. If the statistical analysis of variance&#xD;
      results are significant, in-depth statistical analysis will be performed, and the Bonferroni&#xD;
      method will be used for pairwise comparisons. Otherwise, the Kruskal-Wallis test will be&#xD;
      performed. If the statistical results of the Kruskal-Wallis test are significant, in-depth&#xD;
      statistical analysis will be performed, and the independent Wilcoxon signed rank test will be&#xD;
      performed. The Bonferroni method will be used to adjust P values for pairwise comparisons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety evaluation Safety analysis and analysis of the incidence of postoperative&#xD;
      complications will be performed using descriptive statistics. The chi-squared test or&#xD;
      Fisher's exact test will be performed for comparisons between groups. If significant&#xD;
      differences exist, the Bonferroni method will be used to adjust the α value, and in-depth&#xD;
      pairwise comparisons will be made between groups. Vital signs and laboratory outcomes will be&#xD;
      analyzed using descriptive statistics. The paired t-test or Wilcoxon signed rank test will be&#xD;
      used to analyze the differences between values before and after surgery. Imaging data and&#xD;
      electrocardiograms will be analyzed using cross tabulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Economic analysis Cost-utility analysis will be used for economic evaluation, and sensitivity&#xD;
      analysis of cost and utility will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interim analysis When an adequate number of patients are enrolled and followed-up, interim&#xD;
      analysis will be performed. When data are included for the full analysis set and recorded in&#xD;
      the database, the first interim analysis during the management period will be performed to&#xD;
      check whether the core data collected are suitable for preliminary significant data analysis.&#xD;
      According to research progression, subsequent interim analysis of all data included in the&#xD;
      database will then be designated. After acquiring approval from the Department of General&#xD;
      Surgery and Scientific Construction Committee, the Fourth Affiliated Hospital of China&#xD;
      Medical University, the data collected in the Department of General Surgery, the Fourth&#xD;
      Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University are likely to be analyzed together with the&#xD;
      data collected from the other research centers. In accordance with applicable laws and&#xD;
      regulations, the information on the subjects in the study will be kept confidential. The data&#xD;
      for interim analysis will be precisely described in a statistical analysis plan. The interim&#xD;
      analysis results will be submitted to the sponsor and the project manager in the form of a&#xD;
      statistical analysis report, and as slides by the co-sponsors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size Investigators hypothesized that anterior transversalis fascia repair can reduce&#xD;
      the percentage of patients with postoperative pain by 15% compared with the percentage of&#xD;
      patients with pain before surgery. Taking α = 0.05 and power = 80%, the final effective&#xD;
      sample size of n = 300 was calculated. Assuming a patient loss rate of 20%, investigators&#xD;
      require 360 patients. This study is planned to be performed in more than nine institutes to&#xD;
      investigate the effectiveness of inguinal hernia repair via the anterior transversalis fascia&#xD;
      approach versus the preperitoneal approach in patients in northern China. Investigators plan&#xD;
      to include at least 2,000 patients.&#xD;
