  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project focuses on prevention of major pregnancy and birth related complications :&#xD;
      pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH), gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), caesarean section&#xD;
      (CS), and large-for-gestational-age (LGA), i.e. the birth weight of the baby exceeds the 90%&#xD;
      percentile of birth weights for the specific pregnancy duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators focus on the pre-conception period, i.e. the pre-conception period of the&#xD;
      2nd pregnancy in women with an excessive weight gain during their 1st pregnancy, aiming to&#xD;
      decrease the complications rate in their 2nd pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women with an excessive gestational weight gain have obtained the extra weight during a&#xD;
      rather short period of time, e.g. 20 kilos in the last 4 or 5 months of their pregnancy. This&#xD;
      characteristic distinguishes the target group from the general population with&#xD;
      overweight/obesity, in whom the extra weight was acquired during many years and independent&#xD;
      from a pregnancy, making a behaviour change more complex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The coaching intervention combines face-to-face counselling with the use of a mobile App&#xD;
      connected to medical devices (scale and pedometer). The app monitors important indicators&#xD;
      (weight, eating behaviour, physical activity, mental wellbeing), provides coaching through&#xD;
      established behavioral change techniques, and is specifically tailored for women with&#xD;
      excessive weight gain during the previous pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal is to decrease the rate of pregnancy and birth-related adverse outcomes in the next&#xD;
      pregnancy by a healthy life style, starting shortly after their 1st delivery and sustained&#xD;
      during the next pregnancy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim is to decrease the prevalence of pregnancy and birth-related complications&#xD;
      (pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH), gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), caesarean section&#xD;
      (CS), and large-for-gestational-age babies (LGA)). These complications occur in 26% of&#xD;
      pregnancies with normal start BMI and adequate weight gain, in 34% in normal start BMI but&#xD;
      excessive gestational weight gain and in up to 66% in obese class III (BMI≥40kg/m²) combined&#xD;
      with excessive gestational weight gain. Moreover, as the prevalence of maternal obesity&#xD;
      continues to rise, increasing numbers of children are exposed to an 'obesogenic intrauterine&#xD;
      environment'. Obesity in pregnancy has therefore the potential to result in an&#xD;
      'intergenerational cycle' of obesity through in utero programming.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators focus on women with excessive weight gain during their 1st pregnancy as&#xD;
      currently, half of them do not return to their pre-pregnancy weight before the next&#xD;
      pregnancy. This results in a complication rate as high as 42% (PIH, GDM, CS, LGA). The&#xD;
      investigators target a healthy BMI at start of pregnancy by intervening during the&#xD;
      pre-conception period- and an adequate weight gain during pregnancy by intervening during&#xD;
      pregnancy in these women. The intervention will be evaluated in a randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      including 1,100 women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed intervention combines face-to-face coaching with the use of a mobile App&#xD;
      (so-called 'inter-act' app) connected to medical devices (scale and pedometer). The app&#xD;
      monitors women's weight, eating behaviour, physical activity, mental wellbeing, and provides&#xD;
      continuously coaching through positive behavioral change techniques. The 'inter-act' App&#xD;
      covers after the 1st delivery breast-feeding support, while during pregnancy, the gestational&#xD;
      weight gain guidelines of the Institute of Medicine (IOM) are included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drop out of less motivated women is avoided as the time points of the four pre-conception&#xD;
      coaching sessions coincide with the existing postnatal follow-up visits for neonates&#xD;
      (Governmental vaccination scheme through the organisation &quot; Kind &amp; Gezin&quot;), and the three&#xD;
      pregnancy coaching sessions coincide with the three routine ultrasound scans during normal&#xD;
      pregnancy (KCE Guidelines).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each year, there are 8,900 singleton pregnancies in Flanders in whom the mother had excessive&#xD;
      gestational weight gain in the prior pregnancy. The current rate of at least one of the four&#xD;
      major pregnancy and birth-related complications (PIH, GDM, CS, LGA) in the 8,900 pregnancies&#xD;
      is 42%. If the complications rate reduces with 1/4, this involves more than 900 pregnancies,&#xD;
      and reduces costs related to caesarean sections, gestational diabetes, obesity in mother &amp;&#xD;
      child.&#xD;

    <description>The existence of pregnancy-induced hypertension and gestational diabetes mellitus are assessed during pregnancy.

    <time_frame>at the time of delivery 2nd pregnancy (max pregnancy duration 44 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Costs related to these complications:&#xD;
caesarean section costs 4,013€ compared to 2,909€ for a vaginal delivery, resulting in a 4,013-2,909= 1,104€ additional cost per caesarean section (Onafhankelijke Ziekenfondsen, 2012).&#xD;
Gestational diabetes has an additional cost 820 € (Danyliv et al., IADPSG 2014, Gestational Diabetes and health care cost).&#xD;
There is also the impact of gestational diabetes on the baby. Intrauterine exposure through gestational diabetes predisposes the off-spring to diabetes: yearly cost for diabetes around 5,800€ (American Diabetes Association).&#xD;
Obesity: yearly additional direct medical cost for obesity approximately 3000 € per person due to increased contacts with health care providers and hospitalisation costs (De Jonghe E and Annemans L, 2009).&#xD;
The costs of the coaching sessions are based on the official nomenclature of midwives (RIZIV - Rijksinstituut voor ziekte- en invaliditeitsverzekering, Belgian institute)</description>

    <description>Pre-conception coaching sessions: We encourage less motivated women to participate to the trial by collaborating with Kind &amp; Gezin from the very beginning, as most timepoints of the counselling sessions coincide with the time points of the Kind&amp;Gezin vaccine scheme (postpartum week 6, week 8, week 12, 6 months). We will organize the coaching in a &quot;mother and baby friendly&quot; community-based setting or in the hospitals, as preferred by the mothers.&#xD;
Pregnancy coaching sessions: take place in hospital, at the time of the three planned ultrasound scans.&#xD;
By consequence, the applied methodology can be applied as such at the moment of global utilisation in Flanders.</description>
