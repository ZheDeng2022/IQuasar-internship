      This study seeks to establish the effect of regular structured feedback on surgical&#xD;
      performance using crowd sourced video assessments with validated objective performance scores&#xD;
      and time to complete a specific surgical procedure through a randomized controlled trial. The&#xD;
      working hypothesis is that regular structured assessment will lead to a greater measurable&#xD;
      improvement in performance, as defined by objective performance scores, than will traditional&#xD;
      feedback methods.&#xD;

      The American Association of Gynecologic Laparoscopists (AAGL) and Accreditation Council of&#xD;
      Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) have endeavored to implement structure and standardization&#xD;
      for the fellowship in minimally invasive gynecologic surgical programs (FMIGS) and obstetric&#xD;
      and gynecology residency programs respectively. Educational objectives are explicitly&#xD;
      delineated. Though the fellowship and residency educational objectives are well rounded, and&#xD;
      include the development of skills to become leaders and educators in the field of minimally&#xD;
      invasive gynecologic surgery (MIGS) and general obstetrics and gynecology, one of the main&#xD;
      objective of the fellowship and residency training is the attainment of surgical skill. This&#xD;
      is ensured by a requirement for a breadth of surgical exposure including vaginal surgery,&#xD;
      hysteroscopy, traditional laparoscopy, management of surgical complications, minimally&#xD;
      invasive hysterectomy, urogynecologic procedures, gastrointestinal surgery, urinary tract&#xD;
      surgery, reproductive surgery, and the surgical management of common gynecologic conditions&#xD;
      such as endometriosis. Minimum case requirements have been implemented to provide guidance&#xD;
      for FMIGS and residency programs. In addition, trainees are required to log surgical cases&#xD;
      and this information is utilized for FMIGS and residency program site inspections as well as&#xD;
      for feedback of surgical competency. Despite standardization efforts by the AAGL and ACGME,&#xD;
      the FMIGS and obstetric and gynecology residency curriculums are still in evolution. There is&#xD;
      likely still great variation in surgical exposure between programs. In addition, though&#xD;
      regular feedback is a requirement of training programs, the process is likely unstructured&#xD;
      and subjective; based on case logs, self-assessments, and feedback by faculty surgeons. There&#xD;
      is thus a critical need to develop a standardized, objective, timely, and actionable feedback&#xD;
      methodology to facilitate program oversight and ensure FMIGS fellows and obstetrics and&#xD;
      gynecology residents are achieving surgical competency throughout their training. In the&#xD;
      absence of such structured feedback models, it will remain difficult to optimize FMIGS&#xD;
      fellowship and obstetrics and gynecology resident training, and provide objective&#xD;
      measurements of the impact of such training on surgical performance and patient outcomes. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long-term goal of this study is to assist in developing methods for surgical assessment&#xD;
      that facilitate program oversight, allow fellows, residents, and program directors to&#xD;
      identify specific skill sets in need of improvement, monitor progress in skill acquisition,&#xD;
      and clearly and objectively document achievement of milestones throughout training. The&#xD;
      study's overall objective is to determine how consistent structured feedback using crowd&#xD;
      sourcing impacts time to complete a task as well as surgical performance as measured by GOALS&#xD;
      and GEARS scores. The central hypothesis is that fellows and residents who receive consistent&#xD;
      structured feedback over a sustained period of time will have shorter task times, overall&#xD;
      improved performance, and greater satisfaction than fellows and residents receiving&#xD;
      traditional feedback. The rationale for this work is that it will provide focus and&#xD;
      supportive data for large-scale studies of surgical skill acquisition and development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study seeks to establish the effect of regular structured feedback on surgical&#xD;
      performance using crowd sourced video assessments with GOALS and GEARS through a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial. The study hypothesizes regular structured assessment will lead to a greater&#xD;
      measurable improvement in performance, as defined by change and GOALS and GEARS scores, than&#xD;
      will traditional feedback methods as well as time to complete a specific procedure.&#xD;
