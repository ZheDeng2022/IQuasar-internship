  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study has been designed to investigate the safety of pembrolizumab treatment for&#xD;
      disease relapse following allogeneic stem cell transplant (alloSCT). Pembrolizumab will be&#xD;
      administered at a fixed dose of 200 mg IV every 3 weeks. Approximately 12-26 patients with&#xD;
      relapsed MDS, AML, or mature B cell (B-NHL, cHL) malignancies that have relapsed following&#xD;
      alloSCT will be enrolled on this trial. Pembrolizumab treatment will be administered for up&#xD;
      to 24 months, provided that neither disease progression, nor development of a dose-limiting&#xD;
      toxicity (DLT), has occurred. Adverse events will be monitored every three weeks throughout&#xD;
      the trial and graded in severity according to the guidelines outlined in the NCI Common&#xD;
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0. This trial will be conducted in&#xD;
      accordance with Good Clinical Practices.&#xD;
