    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of&#xD;
      EXPAREL when administered via local wound infiltration to subjects undergoing open spinal&#xD;
      fusion or reconstructive surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of this study are to assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy&#xD;
      of EXPAREL in this surgical model.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, multi-center, open-label study designed to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of EXPAREL when administered via local wound infiltration to subjects&#xD;
      undergoing open cervical or thoracic spinal fusion or reconstructive surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fifteen subjects are planned for enrollment. Eligible subjects, whose surgical incision must&#xD;
      be at least 8 cm in length, will receive a single dose of EXPAREL (266 mg/20 mL) expanded in&#xD;
      volume with 20-60 mL normal saline, depending on the size of the incision. Incision will be&#xD;
      performed using a posterior surgical approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Administration Technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study drug should be injected in the prescribed locations based on the areas of highest nerve&#xD;
      density. Study drug will be administered using syringes with 22-gauge needles prior to wound&#xD;
      closure. The Investigator must document the size of the incision. Each infiltration site&#xD;
      should be spaced 1.0-1.5 cm apart and should deliver approximately 1-1.5 mL into both deep&#xD;
      and superficial areas (para-spinous fascia, muscle, and subcutaneous layers). As each&#xD;
      incision will have three layers of infiltration, the total volume to be infiltrated can range&#xD;
      from 40-80 mL (please refer to below specifics on how to determine total volume of&#xD;
      expansion). Following infiltration, the tissue should visibly expand with minimal leakage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total Volume of Expansion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigator must document the total volume used for each surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EXPAREL (20 mL) + normal saline (20-60 mL based on the incision size) = total volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For example: If the infiltration sites are 1.5 cm apart, then a 10 cm incision would be&#xD;
           10 × 2 sides × 3 layers = 60 cm. If there is 1 mL infiltrated every 1.5 cm, the total&#xD;
           volume would be 40 mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be screened within 30 days prior to study drug administration. During the&#xD;
      screening visit, which must take place at least 1 day prior to surgery, subjects will be&#xD;
      assessed for past or present neurologic, cardiac, and general medical conditions that in the&#xD;
      opinion of the Investigator would preclude them from study participation. After the informed&#xD;
      consent form (ICF) is signed, a medical/surgical history, physical examination, vital signs,&#xD;
      12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), neurological assessment, alcohol breath test, urine drug&#xD;
      screen, and urine pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trained and qualified Investigators will use their usual standard of care surgical technique&#xD;
      to perform the surgery. The use of fentanyl or analogues will be permitted (during surgery&#xD;
      only). Intraoperative administration of other opioids or any other analgesic, local&#xD;
      anesthetics, or anti-inflammatory agents will be prohibited unless needed to treat an adverse&#xD;
      event (AE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects must remain in the hospital for at least 72 hours after surgery in order to undergo&#xD;
      postsurgical assessments. In addition, subjects must return for the 84 hour and 96 hour study&#xD;
      assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 7 Follow-Up Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will return on Day 7 for a follow-up visit, which will include vital sign&#xD;
      measurements, 12-lead ECG, neurological assessment, blood sample collection for PK analysis,&#xD;
      and an AE assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postsurgical Safety Assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will include a cardiac assessment (i.e., 12-lead ECG), neurological assessment, and&#xD;
      vital signs. Adverse events will be recorded from the time the ICF is signed through Day 30.&#xD;
      If a cardiac or neurological AE of special interest or SAE occurs during the study, an&#xD;
      unscheduled PK blood sample must be collected. In addition, a 12-lead ECG, vital signs, and&#xD;
      any appropriate clinical laboratory tests must be conducted. Cardiac AEs of special interest&#xD;
      include chest pain (angina, myocardial infarction), abnormal/irregular heart rate&#xD;
      (bradycardia, tachycardia, extrasystoles), and shortness of breath requiring intervention.&#xD;
      Neurologic AEs of special interest include altered mental status/altered sensorium, rigidity,&#xD;
      dysarthria, seizure, tremors, metallic taste, tinnitus, perioral numbness, visual&#xD;
      disturbance, and severe or worsening dizziness. Additionally, the following events are of&#xD;
      special interest if they persist or occur beyond 72-hours postdose: dizziness, hyperesthesia,&#xD;
      muscular twitching, and tingling/paresthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postsurgical Efficacy Assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
      Will include pain intensity scores using a 10 cm visual analog scale (VAS) and use of&#xD;
      supplemental opioid rescue medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetic Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples for PK analysis will be obtained predose (on Day 1 prior to study drug&#xD;
      administration); 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, and 96 hours&#xD;
      after the beginning of study drug administration; and on Day 7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Planned Patients for enrollment is 15 adult subjects.&#xD;
