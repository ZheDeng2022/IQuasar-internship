  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite improvements in management, mortality in severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains&#xD;
      25% and only 40% of patients survive without major handicap. Medical/surgical interventions&#xD;
      aim to maintain adequate brain perfusion, which is critically dependent on cerebral perfusion&#xD;
      pressure (CPP); calculated as the difference between mean arterial pressure (MAP) and&#xD;
      intracranial pressure (ICP). Current guidelines aim for a CPP above 50 mmHg, based on&#xD;
      population means. However, this 'one size fits all' approach is flawed, because the relation&#xD;
      between CPP and brain perfusion varies between individuals. Further, this approach takes no&#xD;
      account of autoregulation, a key protective mechanism that maintains cerebral perfusion&#xD;
      despite CPP fluctuations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Autoregulation is variably preserved following TBI, and there are large between patient&#xD;
      variances in the 'optimal' CPP (CPPopt) at which autoregulation operates best. Individual&#xD;
      CPPopt can be retrieved automatically by plotting autoregulation data against the CPP over a&#xD;
      certain time window. The investigators have shown that maintenance of CPP close to CPPopt is&#xD;
      associated with improved outcomes. These data pose the hypothesis that optimisation of&#xD;
      management in individuals may be achieved by using the zone of optimal autoregulation as a&#xD;
      basis for defining individualised CPP targets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose, together with collaborators in the CPPopt study group (Maastricht,&#xD;
      Cambridge, Leuven and Aachen) to set up a pilot (multicenter) feasibility study to develop a&#xD;
      protocol for a definitive outcome randomized controlled trial (RCT). This study aims to&#xD;
      develop protocols for CPPopt guided critical care, and show that they maintain patients&#xD;
      closer to their optimum perfusion levels than standard protocols which keep above a&#xD;
      population CPP threshold of 60 mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence, the main objective is to offer clinicians monitoring and therapy algorithms that&#xD;
      achieve individualized optimal CPPopt targets and potentially improve TBI outcome.&#xD;

    <description>Main feasible endpoint: In pilot studies, we showed that, on average, patients spent a mean (+SD) of 30% ( 8%) of their monitored time with measured CPP within 5 mmHg of CPPopt. The study will be powered to target an increase in this metric to 50% of monitored time.</description>

    <description>Main safety secondary endpoint: A change in daily TIL score of &gt; 3 is representative of a clinical significant escalation of TBI treatment from basic ICP management to second tier therapies known to carry risk of harm and therefore is expected to represent a clinically significant potentially harmful effect of CPPopt guided management.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any adult severe TBI patient requiring multimodality monitoring and ICP-directed&#xD;
             therapy for at least 24 hrs on the assessment of the recruiting team.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Start randomization within 24 hrs after ICU admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Deferred informed consent or deferred proxy assent from relatives/legal representative&#xD;
             (consultee).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Exception for enrolling a patient past the 24 hour window: A patient who is admitted&#xD;
             to the hospital and later experiences neuro-worsening that is not due to a systemic&#xD;
             insult, (e.g. myocardial infarction, arrhythmia, pulmonary embolus, systemic&#xD;
             hemorrhage) but due to a presumptive intracranial cause, and subsequently requires an&#xD;
             ICP monitor, may be screened for enrolment. Consent, randomization, and monitor&#xD;
             placement must be done within 48 hours from injury in order for the patient to&#xD;
             qualify.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients &lt; 18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Moribund at presentation (e.g. bilaterally absent pupillary responses)&#xD;
