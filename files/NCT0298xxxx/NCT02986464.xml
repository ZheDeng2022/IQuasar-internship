    <textblock>
      Procedural pain is the most intense and often undertreated pain associated with burn&#xD;
      injuries. The use of analgesics does not always provide optimal relief and is accompanied by&#xD;
      several side effects. Indeed, children with burn injuries still experience severe pain&#xD;
      intensity during procedures despite the fact that doses of analgesics used with this&#xD;
      population has almost doubled in the last twenty years. Current guidelines on pediatric&#xD;
      procedural pain management recommend the combination of non-pharmacological and&#xD;
      pharmacological interventions to enhance pain management and decrease the numerous side&#xD;
      effects of analgesics. Distraction has been identified among the most effective&#xD;
      non-pharmacological interventions for pain as it diverts the child's attention to an&#xD;
      attractive element, hindering the perception of the painful stimuli. Virtual reality is a&#xD;
      method of active distraction that offers the child a multi-sensory immersive interaction that&#xD;
      found many applications for pain management in adult patients. However, very few studies have&#xD;
      tested the efficacy of distraction by virtual reality on procedural pain and anxiety in&#xD;
      children with burn injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This RCT follows a pilot study (NCT02794103) aimed at assessing the feasibility of a virtual&#xD;
      reality prototype developed specifically for the hydrotherapy room of children under seven&#xD;
      years old for the relief of procedural pain in children with burn injuries. The aim of the&#xD;
      RCT will be to evaluate the effectiveness of the virtual reality prototype in relieving&#xD;
      procedural pain in children from 6 months to 7 years old undergoing hydrotherapy session for&#xD;
      burn injuries.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary data from the pilot study showed that the virtual reality prototype installed&#xD;
      around the tank in the hydrotherapy room is a feasible and acceptable method of distraction&#xD;
      that doesn't interfere with the work of healthcare professionals and could be used as a&#xD;
      non-pharmacological method for pain management. A clinical trial is needed to assess the&#xD;
      effectiveness of this intervention for procedural pain relief. The pilot study was also&#xD;
      informative about the feasibility of the study design and the measurement used. The methods&#xD;
      section was modified and adapted consequently for the upcoming trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Within-subject/crossover study design. Each child will serve as their own control and&#xD;
      will receive both standard and experimental treatment during the same hydrotherapy session&#xD;
      through a randomized order.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample and Setting: Convenience sampling on the surgical-trauma burn unit at CHU Ste-Justine,&#xD;
      of children admitted to the unit or to the day hospital for a burn injury. The intervention&#xD;
      will take place in the hydrotherapy room of the CHU Ste-Justine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions. A) Standard pharmacological treatment as per the unit's protocol. B) VR&#xD;
      distraction through the use of a virtual reality prototype installed around the tank in the&#xD;
      hydrotherapy room. The prototype has been developed in collaboration with the Society of Arts&#xD;
      and Technology (SAT) in Montreal to provide an immersive interactive experience for the burn&#xD;
      child in the hydrotherapy tank. The prototype was developed after several meetings between&#xD;
      the researchers, the designers and engineers and the surgical trauma team of CHU Ste-Justine.&#xD;
      Meetings were followed by an ergonomic study of the hydrotherapy room to meet the unit's and&#xD;
      patients' specifications and ensure that it doesn't interfere with the healthcare&#xD;
      professionals work.The video games were developed by our team with a personalized care&#xD;
      content tailored to the children's developmental stage and to maximize the feeling of&#xD;
      immersion and minimize cybersickness, and approved by a team of healthcare professionals in&#xD;
      pediatric burn care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study proceedings: Hydrotherapy sessions typically last between 20 to 40 minutes. The&#xD;
      duration will be divided into two sequences of the same duration (10 to 20 minutes) where the&#xD;
      participant receives the same care by the same healthcare professional. For one sequence,&#xD;
      only the standard treatment will be administered and for the other sequence, patients will&#xD;
      receive the standard treatment in addition to Virtual Reality via the screen around the tank&#xD;
      in a randomized order.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures: Pain and anxiety measures will be taken before the treatment session at Baseline&#xD;
      (T1), in the middle of the first sequence of the session (T2) and in the middle of the second&#xD;
      sequence of the session (T3) followed by a measure of healthcare professionals' satisfaction&#xD;
      level via a questionnaire developed and pretested by the team after the session (T4). Data&#xD;
      will be collected on the average doses of analgesics administered before and during the&#xD;
      session, and the side effects experienced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis: Quantitative analysis. Mean differences in pain scores between sequences will&#xD;
      be compared using Wilcoxon test.&#xD;
