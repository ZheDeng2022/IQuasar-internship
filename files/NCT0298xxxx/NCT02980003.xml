  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intravascular administration of iodinated contrast media is an essential tool for&#xD;
      cardiovascular imaging and percutaneous coronary interventions. Nonetheless, the increasing&#xD;
      incidence of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) has become an important and prognostically&#xD;
      relevant problem along with the spreading of diagnostic and interventional procedures. CIN is&#xD;
      largely dependent on oxidative damage and represents a considerable cause of renal failure,&#xD;
      being associated with prolonged hospitalization and significant morbidity/mortality. The most&#xD;
      effective treatment strategy of this serious complication remains prevention, and several&#xD;
      preventive measures have been extensively investigated in the last few years. Pre-procedural&#xD;
      hydration is the best known and mostly accepted strategy. The administration of sodium&#xD;
      bicarbonate (HCO3) has controversial effects, and is likely to be ineffective when the&#xD;
      infused dose is unable to achieve adequate urine alkalinization. Since alkaline pH suppresses&#xD;
      the production of free radicals, increasing urine pH would be an attractive goal for CIN&#xD;
      prevention. In a randomized clinical trial the investigators will test the hypothesis that&#xD;
      urine alkalinization with either oral or i.v. bicarbonate on top of hydration alone is the&#xD;
      main determinant of CIN prevention in a population of patients with moderate or severe&#xD;
      chronic kidney disease scheduled for coronary angiography and/or angioplasty. If the&#xD;
      investigators, demonstrate non-significant differences in urine alkalinization (primary&#xD;
      endpoint) and incidence of CIN (secondary endpoint) between the bicarbonate groups, a&#xD;
      practical implication will be that oral administration is preferable for practical reasons&#xD;
      over the administration of i.v. bicarbonate.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Contrast medium-induced nephropathy (CIN) is a recognized complication in coronary diagnostic&#xD;
      and interventional procedures, and is associated with prolonged hospitalization and adverse&#xD;
      clinical outcomes. The frequency of CIN ranges from 2% in low-risk patients to 50% in&#xD;
      high-risk patients. The most important risk factors for CIN development are pre-existing&#xD;
      renal failure, diabetes, age, volume and type of contrast medium. There are two main&#xD;
      pathogenetic mechanisms postulated to cause CIN:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. a direct toxic action of contrast medium on kidney tubule cells, causing a disruption of&#xD;
           mitochondrial function, the generation of reactive oxygen species, and subsequent cell&#xD;
           injury and apoptosis;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. vasoconstriction, reducing the blood flow through the renal medulla and causing ischemia&#xD;
           with cell damage The treatment of CIN is exclusively supportive. Treatment is&#xD;
           particularly recommended in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD - mild, moderate&#xD;
           or severe, according to estimated glomerular filtration rate - eGFR). Several approaches&#xD;
           have been tested in the prevention of CIN with variable success. Adequate hydration is&#xD;
           widely accepted as the best method for prevention of CIN, and is today the only strategy&#xD;
           generally accepted by international guidelines (class of recommendation I, level of&#xD;
           evidence A). The use of N-acetyl cysteine, recommended even in the recent past, is not&#xD;
           supported by a recent randomized trial14 and a meta-analysis. Hemodialysis and&#xD;
           hemofiltration may be effective in preventive CIN, but are reserved to high-risk&#xD;
           patients. Attempts at preventing CIN with various medications, such as furosemide,&#xD;
           vitamin C, statins and numerous other, have been largely unsuccessful. The efficacy of&#xD;
           bicarbonate in the prevention of CIN has been extensively tested; the rationale is here&#xD;
           that urine alkalinization suppresses the formation of free radicals. Actually, studies&#xD;
           on bicarbonate have been controversial, varying from beneficial to toxic effects; this&#xD;
           could bring into question the role of alkalinizing procedures in preventing CIN.&#xD;
           Nevertheless, favorable results of prevention protocols using bicarbonate have been&#xD;
           noted in studies also documenting a significant alkalinization of urines; while a&#xD;
           similar protocol did not prove to be effective when the dose of bicarbonate was&#xD;
           insufficient to such aim. Moreover, Markota et al., in a recent study on patients with&#xD;
           estimated eGFR &gt;15 mL/min/1.73 m2 and scheduled for coronary angiography, after&#xD;
           documenting that Na/K citrate significantly reduced the incidence of CIN when compared&#xD;
           with hydration alone, have shown that patients having a urine pH &lt;6 had a more than&#xD;
           ten-fold higher incidence of CIN compared with patients whose urine pH was &gt;6.28 These&#xD;
           results confirm the potential role of urine alkalinization in preventing CIN and place&#xD;
           the oral administration of alkalinizing drugs as an attractive method compared to the&#xD;
           more complex, and not always effective, i.v. infusion of bicarbonate. Finally, oral&#xD;
           doses of bicarbonate may be sufficient to alkalinize the urine and thus to prevent CIN.&#xD;
           In a study recently published, an oral dose of 4 g was sufficient to obtain, two hours&#xD;
           after administration, an adequate urinary alkalinization with a pH &gt;7 in all&#xD;
           participants without side effects. This value was maintained and even magnified nearly 8&#xD;
           hours after the last dose. Interestingly, the Authors observed an additive effect after&#xD;
           the second dose, showing a nondepleting urine pH, despite the reported short half-life&#xD;
           of sodium bicarbonate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Against this background, the investigators will here test the hypothesis that both oral and&#xD;
      i.v. bicarbonate are adequate strategies for CIN prevention in patients after coronary&#xD;
      angiography. Comparing the incidence of CIN according to urine pH achieved immediately before&#xD;
      angiography, the investigators aim at demonstrating that urine alkalinization is the real&#xD;
      goal, and that results are here largely independent from the strategy adopted to achieve it.&#xD;
      The investigators will therefore compare the efficacy in alkalinizing urine and preventing&#xD;
      CIN of three different strategies: hydration alone; hydration plus i.v. sodium bicarbonate;&#xD;
      and hydration plus oral bicarbonate. Favorable results of the bicarbonate groups compared to&#xD;
      the control group could increase the evidence supporting the use of alkalinizing strategies&#xD;
      to prevent CIN; at the same time, non-inferiority results of the oral group compared to i.v.&#xD;
      bicarbonate group could suggest the more practical oral administration as the preferred&#xD;
      prevention strategy.&#xD;
