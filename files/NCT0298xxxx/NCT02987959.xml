  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label phase II study of TAK-228 for patients ≥ 18 years of age with complex&#xD;
      genomic sarcomas exhibiting Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase (PI3K) pathway dysregulation. Patients&#xD;
      must have surgically unresectable or metastatic disease that is refractory to at least one&#xD;
      prior line of therapy (not including neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy in a curative setting).&#xD;
      Patients disease must also have evidence of progression prior to enrollment. The purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to determine the antitumor activity in this group of patients. Patients must&#xD;
      meet all eligibility criteria as detailed in section 10. A total of up to 33 patients will be&#xD;
      included in the study. Patients will undergo screening evaluations to determine eligibility&#xD;
      within 28 days of the first dose. All patients will be required to submit baseline tumor&#xD;
      samples for analysis. Patients who have had their tumors tested commercially for PI3K/&#xD;
      AKT/mechanistic Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) alterations will be assessed on a case by case&#xD;
      basis for eligibility and for determination as to whether additional tissue is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TAK-228 will be administered orally at 3 mg daily for a 21 day cycle. Clinical and laboratory&#xD;
      assessments will be made on day 1 of each cycle. Disease will be assessed by comparing&#xD;
      unidimensional tumor measurements on pre and peritreatment imaging (CT or MRI) after weeks 6,&#xD;
      12, 18 and every 12 weeks thereafter. Response will be assessed according to RECIST 1.1.&#xD;
      Therapy will continue until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of&#xD;
      consent.&#xD;

TAK-228: TAK-228 is a novel, highly selective, orally bioavailable adenosine 5' triphosphate (ATP)-competitive inhibitor of the serine/threonine kinase referred to as the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR). TAK-228 (formerly INK128) targets 2 distinct mTOR complexes, mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2).</description>
