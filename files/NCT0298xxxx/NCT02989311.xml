  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infants and young children in sub-Saharan Africa have high rates of iron deficiency anemia&#xD;
      (IDA), which adversely affects their growth and cognitive development. In-home iron&#xD;
      fortification of complementary foods using micronutrient powders (MNPs) reduces risk for IDA&#xD;
      by ensuring that the iron needs of infants and young children are met without changing their&#xD;
      traditional diet. In order to optimize iron absorption timing of MNP consumption might as&#xD;
      well be important. This is because hepcidin, a key regulator of systemic iron balance, shows&#xD;
      a circadian increase that may influence morning versus afternoon iron absorption from the&#xD;
      MNP. Furthermore, a single dose of iron can increase hepcidin levels and potentially inhibit&#xD;
      iron absorption from a second dose, consumed close in time to the first dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the difference between i) morning versus afternoon iron absorption and ii)&#xD;
      consecutive versus alternate day iron absorption, investigators will enrol 20 infants from&#xD;
      Kwale County aged 6-14 months and conduct two studies. In study 1, infants will consume 2&#xD;
      test meals consisting of maize porridge containing isotopically labelled Ferrous Sulphate in&#xD;
      the morning and afternoon on 2 days. In study 2, infants will consume 3 test meals consisting&#xD;
      of maize porridge containing isotopically labelled Ferrous Sulphate on two consecutive days&#xD;
      and 1 alternate day. In both studies, fourteen days after the last test meal administration,&#xD;
      a whole blood sample will be collected by venipuncture for iron isotopic analysis. Iron and&#xD;
      inflammation status parameter will be determined at baseline and endpoint. Hepcidin&#xD;
      concentrations will be measured before the morning and afternoon meals (study 1) and after&#xD;
      second consecutive meal (study 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowing the effect of time on the expected iron absorption will inform decisions on the ideal&#xD;
      timing of MNP to cover the infant's requirement for absorbed iron.&#xD;

      20 infants will be recruited from the Msambweni County Referral Hospital in southern coastal&#xD;
      Kenya to participate in both studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline a morning blood sample will be collected from potential study participants for&#xD;
      the determination of the following iron and inflammation status parameters: hemoglobin (Hb),&#xD;
      hepcidin, plasma ferritin (PF), soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), zinc protoporphyrin&#xD;
      (ZnPP), C-reactive protein (CRP), alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AGP). Anthropometrics (height,&#xD;
      weight, mid-upper arm and head circumference) will be measured, and demographics, the medical&#xD;
      history and the feeding habits will be assessed using a questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infants will consume the 1st test meal the next day after enrolment in the morning (day1). On&#xD;
      day 2 a 2nd blood sample (1ml) will be collected in the afternoon quantify afternoon&#xD;
      concentration of hepcidin in plasma and then the infants will consume the 2nd meal on the 3rd&#xD;
      day in the afternoon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two isotopically labelled test meals will be fed to the infants by their caregivers under&#xD;
      supervision of the research team. The morning test meal A will contain 12 mg of iron as&#xD;
      ferrous sulfate given as 2 mg of 57Fe and 10mg of 56Fe. The afternoon test meal will contain&#xD;
      12 mg of iron as ferrous sulfate given as 2 mg of 58Fe and 10 mg of 56Fe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The test meals will consist of maize porridge (5-10% dry weight) and mineral water (8ml) and&#xD;
      will be randomly administered on the two alternate days (AB or BA). Overnight, only breast&#xD;
      milk will be allowed to the infant before coming for the morning meal and no breast milk will&#xD;
      be given at least 3 h before both morning and afternoon test meal administration. Infants&#xD;
      will not be allowed to eat or drink for 2 h after the test meal. Fourteen days after the&#xD;
      second test meal administration, 3 ml of whole blood will be collected by venipuncture for&#xD;
      iron isotopic analysis and iron and inflammation status. Anthropometrics and health status&#xD;
      will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline a blood sample will be collected from potential study participants for the&#xD;
      determination of iron and inflammation status parameters: hemoglobin (Hb), hepcidin, plasma&#xD;
      ferritin (PF), soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), zinc protoporphyrin (ZnPP), C-reactive&#xD;
      protein (CRP), alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AGP). Anthropometrics (height, weight, mid-upper&#xD;
      arm and head circumference) will be measured, and demographics, the medical history and the&#xD;
      feeding habits will be assessed using a questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infants will be randomized to consume the consecutive days or alternate day meal schedule on&#xD;
      day 1. 1ml of blood will be collected after the second consecutive meal to determine hepcidin&#xD;
      level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test meal A will contain 12 mg of iron as ferrous sulfate given as 2 mg of 54Fe and 10mg of&#xD;
      56Fe. Test meal B will contain 12 mg of iron as ferrous sulfate given as 2 mg of 57Fe and&#xD;
      10mg of 56Fe. Test meal C will contain 12 mg of iron as ferrous sulfate given as 2 mg of 58Fe&#xD;
      and 10mg of 56Fe. All test meals will be consumed in the morning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The test meals will consist of maize porridge (5-10% dry weight) and mineral water (8ml).&#xD;
      Overnight, only breast milk will be allowed to the infant and no breast milk will be given at&#xD;
      least 3 h before test meal administration. Test meals plus mineral water will be consumed&#xD;
      completely in the presence of the investigators, and the infant will not be allowed to eat or&#xD;
      drink for 2 h after the test meal. Fourteen days after the third test meal, 3 ml of whole&#xD;
      blood will be collected by venipuncture for iron and inflammation status, and iron analysis&#xD;
      in red blood cells.&#xD;
