  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common peripheral entrapment neuropathy with&#xD;
      involving compression of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel. Rather than other progressive&#xD;
      disease, CTS is characterized by remission and recurrence. Although many conservative&#xD;
      managements of CTS, the effectiveness of these methods is insignificant or only persist for a&#xD;
      short duration. The platelet rich plasma (PRP) is a new and potential treatment for patients&#xD;
      with kinds of musculoskeletal disorders and recent reports showed being beneficial for&#xD;
      peripheral neuropathy in animal studies. Since 2014, three small clinical trials showed the&#xD;
      positive effect of PRP in peripheral neuropathy included CTSin a pilot research. However,&#xD;
      these studies have not entirely proved the effects of PRP on peripheral neuropathy because&#xD;
      these studies enrolled small number of patients and lacked controlled design. The&#xD;
      investigators design a randomized, double-blind, controlled trail to assess the effect after&#xD;
      ultrasound-guided PRP injection in patients with CTS.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After obtaining written informed consent, patients with bilateral CTS will been randomized&#xD;
      into intervention and control side. Participants in intervention group received one-dose&#xD;
      ultrasound-guided PRP injection and control side received one-dose ultrasound-guided normal&#xD;
      saline injection. No additional treatment after injection through the study period. The&#xD;
      primary outcome is Boston Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Questionnaire (BCTQ) and secondary outcomes&#xD;
      include visual analog scale (VAS), cross-sectional area (CSA) of the median nerve, sensory&#xD;
      nerve conduction velocity of the median nerve, and finger pinch strength. The evaluation was&#xD;
      performed pretreatment as well as on the 2nd week, 1st, 3rd, 6th month and one year after the&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
