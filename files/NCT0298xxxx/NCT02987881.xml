      This study will evaluate whether the use of the Jawbone wristband monitor, in connection with&#xD;
      home-based exercise and nutritional counseling can be safely completed and improve&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory fitness (heart and lung health) in women with early stage endometrial&#xD;
      cancer who have undergone surgery.&#xD;
