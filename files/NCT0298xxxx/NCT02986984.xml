      This is a prospective, observational, cohort study of patients with a clinical diagnosis of&#xD;
      diabetes who are undergoing clinically indicated kidney biopsy. The intent is to collect,&#xD;
      process, and study kidney tissue and to harvest blood, urine and genetic materials to&#xD;
      elucidate molecular pathways and link them to biomarkers that characterize those patients&#xD;
      have a rapid decline in kidney function (&gt; 5 mL/min/1.73m2/year) from those with lesser&#xD;
      degrees of kidney function change over the period of observation. High through-put genomic&#xD;
      analysis associated with genetic and biomarker testing will serve to identify key potential&#xD;
      therapeutic targets for DKD by comparing patients with rapid and slow progression patterns.&#xD;
      Each participating clinical site will search for, consent, harvest the biopsy sample, and&#xD;
      enroll the participants as required for the TRIDENT protocol.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Progress in the area of diabetic kidney research leading to new therapeutics development has&#xD;
      been very limited. Indeed, no new medicines indicated for the treatment of chronic kidney&#xD;
      disease (CKD) have been approved since ARB's have become standard of care nearly 15 years&#xD;
      ago. Several factors explain the limited progress including but not limited to; a) animal and&#xD;
      cell culture models do not recapitulate human DKD b) human genetic studies so far have failed&#xD;
      to identify reproducible genetic variants associated with DKD c) the clinical manifestation&#xD;
      of DKD is heterogeneous and might have even changed since the original description d) DKD is&#xD;
      a clinical diagnosis and it is not clear what percentage of patients have histological&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory mice have served as invaluable tools to understand human disease development. As&#xD;
      mouse genetic tools became readily available, it enabled us to perform time and cell type&#xD;
      specific gene manipulation in animals to generate disease models and to understand the&#xD;
      contributions of specific pathways. Unfortunately, mouse models do not recapitulate human&#xD;
      diabetic kidney disease as animals develop only early DKD lesions; mesangial expansion and&#xD;
      mild albuminuria11. Most models do not develop arterial hyalinosis, tubulointerstitial&#xD;
      fibrosis and declining glomerular filtration rate (GFR); hallmarks of progressive DKD. There&#xD;
      are several fundamental differences in gene expression patterns and physiology of human and&#xD;
      murine kidneys. Such differences may explain the lack of translatability between mice and&#xD;
      humans of pharmacological approaches aimed at treating DKD. This seems to be a general trend&#xD;
      in other disease areas as well (for example Alzheimer's disease), leading to a recent&#xD;
      movement toward translational and clinical research with increasing reliance on human&#xD;
      samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human genetic studies made paradigm-shifting observations in relatively rare monogenic forms&#xD;
      of kidney diseases (including polycystic kidney disease and focal segmental&#xD;
      glomerulosclerosis). Diabetic CKD on the other hand follows a complex polygenic pattern.&#xD;
      Currently, the most powerful method to define the genetics of complex diseases such as DKD is&#xD;
      genome wide association (GWAS), where associations between polymorphisms and the disease&#xD;
      state are tested. Prior studies indicate that for complex traits, such as DKD, genetic&#xD;
      polymorphisms that are associated with disease state are localized to the non-coding region&#xD;
      of the genome12,13. Moreover, the genetic architecture of diabetic kidney disease has not&#xD;
      been characterized and several large collaborations are currently addressing this issue14.&#xD;
      Thus, the next challenge is to define target genes, target cell types and the mode of&#xD;
      dysregulation caused by non-coding snips (SNPs15). Such studies require large collection of&#xD;
      human tissue samples from disease relevant organs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) remains a clinical diagnosis. Subjects with CKD in the presence&#xD;
      of diabetes and albuminuria are considered to have diabetic nephropathy. Such definition is&#xD;
      used in clinical practice and in research studies including clinical trials. Studies&#xD;
      performed in 1980 provide the basis for the practice16,17. Investigators stage DKD as a&#xD;
      progressive disease, beginning with the loss of small amounts of albumin into the urine&#xD;
      (30-300mg/day; known as the stage of microalbuminuria, high albuminuria, occult or incipient&#xD;
      nephropathy), then larger amounts (&gt;300mg/day; known as macroalbuminuria, very high&#xD;
      albuminuria or overt nephropathy), followed by progressive decline in kidney function (eGFR),&#xD;
      renal impairment and ultimately ESRD 17-19. This paradigm has proved useful in clinical&#xD;
      studies, especially in type 1 diabetes, for identifying cohorts at increased risk of adverse&#xD;
      health outcomes. However, boundaries between stages of DKD are artificial and the&#xD;
      relationship between urinary albumin excretion and adverse health outcomes is log-linear in&#xD;
      clinical practice. Indeed, the American Diabetes Association recently abandoned staging of&#xD;
      albuminuria (ACR) for a more-straightforward [ACR &gt;30 mg/g, (albuminuria present); ACR &lt;30&#xD;
      mg/g (albuminuria absent)] criterion. Moreover, many patients, and especially those with type&#xD;
      2 diabetes, do not follow this classical course in modern clinical practice. For example,&#xD;
      many subjects with DKD do not manifest excessive urinary albumin loss20. Indeed, of the 28%&#xD;
      of the UKPDS cohort who developed moderate to severe renal impairment, half did not have&#xD;
      preceding albuminuria. In the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT), of the 11%&#xD;
      patients with type 1 diabetes who developed an eGFR&lt;60 ml/min/1.73m2, 40% never had&#xD;
      experienced overt nephropathy21. In addition, most patients with microalbuminuria do not&#xD;
      progressively exhibit an increase in urinary albumin excretion as in the classical paradigm&#xD;
      with treatment-induced and spontaneous 'remission' of albuminuria widely observed22,23.&#xD;
      Consequently, individuals with microalbuminuria may better be regarded as being at increased&#xD;
      risk of developing progressive renal disease (as well as cardiovascular disease and other&#xD;
      diabetic complications), rather than as actually having DKD per se. While over the last 40&#xD;
      years it became evident that the original description of DKD needs revision, no alternative&#xD;
      criteria have emerged given the lack of solid data on the correlation between&#xD;
      histopathological (gold standard) DKD diagnosis and clinical manifestations. It is also&#xD;
      possible that, with the introduction of better glycemic control and anti-renin (RAAS)&#xD;
      blockade, the disease has evolved necessitating new observational cohorts to understand the&#xD;
      clinical disease course and manifestations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetic kidney disease presents with a variable rate of kidney function decline24. Data from&#xD;
      large observational cohorts indicate that GFR decline frequently does not follow a linear&#xD;
      course. Several groups are working on modeling GFR decline patterns in patients. Such studies&#xD;
      contributed to emphasizing patients termed as &quot;rapid progressors&quot;. There is no consensus&#xD;
      definition for rapid progression. Many studies define rapid progressors as patients with&#xD;
      greater than 3 cc/year GFR decrease but alternative cut points such as even 10 cc/year has&#xD;
      also been used. Identification and clinical characterization of rapid progressors became the&#xD;
      center of several large scale efforts as these are the patients who would likely need&#xD;
      intensive clinical management25. Furthermore recent post-hoc analyses of the Diabetic&#xD;
      Nephropathy (IDNT and RENAAL) studies indicate that clinical trial outcomes are mostly driven&#xD;
      by a small number of subjects with unusually rapidly progressive GFR decline i.e. subjects&#xD;
      that display characteristics of rapid progressors. While investigators are still awaiting&#xD;
      accurate descriptions, biomarker and clinical descriptive studies have yielded several&#xD;
      interesting observations. Albuminuria remains one of the strongest risk factor for&#xD;
      &quot;FDA-approved&quot; (hard) renal outcomes; doubling of serum creatinine, dialysis or death. Indeed&#xD;
      some of the latest studies indicate that using a 4 or a 6 variable model, that includes&#xD;
      albuminuria, age, sex, serum phosphate, serum calcium and serum albumin has C-statistics&#xD;
      score of 0.84-0.91 to predict ESRD 26,27. During the last years several new biomarkers have&#xD;
      been identified that can potentially identify patients who are at increased risk for rapid&#xD;
      loss of kidney function. For example blood and urinary levels of kidney injury molecule&#xD;
      (KIM1) shows promise to identify patients who are at risk for kidney function decline.&#xD;
      Recently, investigators showed that circulating levels of tumor necrosis factor receptor 1&#xD;
      and 2 levels can identify patients with rapidly declining renal function 28. While these&#xD;
      markers are generating increased interest; the critical questions remains; why do some&#xD;
      patients follow a rapid decline in kidney function?&#xD;
