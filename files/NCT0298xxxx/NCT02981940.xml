    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a targeted therapy as a possible treatment for recurrent&#xD;
      glioblastoma (GBM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following intervention will be used in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Abemaciclib&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase 0/II clinical trial. Phase 0 clinical trials use only a few&#xD;
      small doses of a drug. Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of an&#xD;
      investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a specific disease.&#xD;
      &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved abemaciclib as a treatment&#xD;
      for any disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many brain cancers show over expression of a protein called cyclin D1. That means that the&#xD;
      body makes too much cyclin D1, which affects enzymes called CDK 4 and CDK 6. Enzymes are&#xD;
      substances in the body that help reactions between cells happen. Too much cyclin D1 triggers&#xD;
      CDK 4 and CDK 6 to make more cells than normal. This extra cell production leads to the&#xD;
      growth of tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In laboratory studies, Abemaciclib was able to enter the brain, stop CDK 4 and CDK 6 from&#xD;
      making cells, and slow growth of mice Glioblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the investigators are looking to see how safe and effect Abemaciclib&#xD;
      is with the participant type of cancer. In the surgical participants, the investigators are&#xD;
      looking to see if Abemaciclib reached the brain tumor.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must be able to understand and willing to sign a written informed consent&#xD;
             document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must be able to adhere to the dosing and visit schedules, and agree to&#xD;
             record medication times accurately and consistently in a daily diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must be at least 18 years old on day of signing informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have a Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) â‰¥ 60&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must be able to swallow capsules/tablets&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment&#xD;
             does not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy of the trial are&#xD;
             eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Nature of illness and treatment history&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must undergo central pathology review to histologically confirm the&#xD;
             diagnosis of glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype; glioblastoma variants; or astrocytoma,&#xD;
             IDH-mutant, WHO grade 4 (1 unstained slide or 1 H&amp;E slide must be submitted to and&#xD;
             reviewed by a pathologist at the DFCI Coordinating Center prior to enrollment of the&#xD;
             participant for central pathology review).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  To be eligible for the study all participants (Cohort 1 and 2) are required to provide&#xD;
             genomic profiling data from assays performed in a CLIA-certified lab. A&#xD;
             sequencing-based assay is required and must include reporting of the RB1 gene in&#xD;
             explicit terms within the report. Only sequencing assays that include coverage of all&#xD;
             exons of the RB1 gene are able to be utilized (most commonly called a targeted exome&#xD;
             assay; e.g. Oncopanel, Impact, FoundationOne). In addition, patients must provide a&#xD;
             report of copy assessment which reports status of RB1. The reporting may be from a&#xD;
             copy array (ideally Oncoscan SNP array or Agilent array CGH) or can also be from&#xD;
             sequencing assay if copy status is explicitly provided with quantitative information&#xD;
             regarding the status of relevant genes. Specifically, the reporting should provide the&#xD;
             following information with respect to relevant biomarkers required for enrollment to&#xD;
             the study as listed below.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Results from genomic profiling must be sent to the DFCI Coordinating Center prior to&#xD;
             enrollment of the participant for central pathology review.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Inactivation of CDKN2A/B or C in the tumor by homozygous deletion (evidence for&#xD;
                  more than single copy loss for any of the genes defined as array CGH/SNP log2&#xD;
                  ratio of &lt;0.3 by array CGH; or from sequencing data with sufficient coverage for&#xD;
                  evaluation). Rearrangement/evidence or intragenic breaks by copy or sequencing&#xD;
                  assay also will be considered eligible for study (any copy status).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  CDK4 or CDK6 high-level amplification. (The amplicon size must be &lt;10Mb and the&#xD;
                  magnitude the gain must be log2 ratio &gt;1.5 or estimated as &gt;10 copies).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AND&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Validation of wild-type RB status (no deletion/losses more than single copy by&#xD;
                  copy number or sequencing data; and/or no inactivating mutations by sequencing).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must be at first relapse of GBM. Relapse is defined as progression&#xD;
             following initial therapy (i.e. radiation+/- chemo if that was used as initial&#xD;
             therapy). The intent therefore is that patients had no more than 1 prior therapy&#xD;
             (initial treatment). If the patient had a surgical resection for relapsed disease and&#xD;
             no anti-cancer therapy was instituted for up to 12 weeks, and the patient undergoes&#xD;
             another surgical resection, this is considered to constitute 1 relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have shown unequivocal evidence for tumor progression by MRI or CT&#xD;
             scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For Cohort 2 subjects, CT or MRI within 14 days prior to study registration. For&#xD;
                  Cohort 2, corticosteroid dose must be stable or decreasing for at least 5 days&#xD;
                  prior to the scan. If steroids are added or the steroid dose is increased between&#xD;
                  the date of the screening MRI or CT scan and the start of treatment, a new&#xD;
                  baseline MRI or CT is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For Cohort 1 subjects, CT or MRI should be performed ideally within 14 days prior&#xD;
                  to study registration, but because the screening MRI for this subset of subjects&#xD;
                  will not be used for evaluation of response, it is acceptable for this MRI/CT to&#xD;
                  have been performed greater than 14 days prior to registration if unavoidable.&#xD;
                  Furthermore, for this same reason, fluctuation in corticosteroid dose around this&#xD;
                  MRI does not warrant repeat scan so long as there is documented unequivocal&#xD;
                  evidence of tumor progression available.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For Cohort 1 subjects, there must be &gt; 2cm2 enhancing tissue available for&#xD;
                  resection and submission for study correlatives as determined by local treating&#xD;
                  team.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Confirmation of availability of sufficient tissue from a prior surgery for correlative&#xD;
             studies is required prior to enrollment; these samples must be sent to the DFCI&#xD;
             Coordinating Center within 60 days of registration. Cohort 1 participants must have&#xD;
             sufficient FFPE tissue from any surgery. Cohort 2 participants must have tissue from&#xD;
             biopsy or resection from the most recent recurrence surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The following amount of archived tissue is required:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  20 unstained formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) sections (standard 4-5&#xD;
                  micrometer thickness)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  NOTE: if the above-mentioned tissue is not available from the most recent surgery&#xD;
                  revealing GBM, participants may be enrolled with tissue available from any prior&#xD;
                  surgery revealing GBM with prospective approval from the Overall PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  An interval of at least 12 weeks from the completion of radiation therapy to start of&#xD;
             study drug unless there is a new area of enhancement consistent with recurrent tumor&#xD;
             outside the radiation field (defined as the region outside the high-dose region or 80%&#xD;
             isodose line) or there is unequivocal histologic confirmation of tumor progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have recovered to grade 0 or 1 or pre-treatment baseline from&#xD;
             clinically significant toxic effects of prior therapy (including but not limited to&#xD;
             exceptions of alopecia, laboratory values listed per inclusion criteria, and&#xD;
             lymphopenia which is common after therapy with temozolomide).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  From the projected start of scheduled study treatment, the following time periods must&#xD;
             have elapsed:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  4 weeks or 5 half-lives (whichever is shorter) from any investigational agent;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  4 weeks from cytotoxic therapy (except 23 days for temozolomide; 6 weeks from&#xD;
                  nitrosoureas);&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  4 weeks from antibodies;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  4 weeks or 5 half-lives (whichever is shorter) from other anti-tumor therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  2 days from Novo-TTF&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with prior therapy that included interstitial brachytherapy or&#xD;
             stereotactic radiosurgery must have confirmation of progressive disease based upon&#xD;
             nuclear imaging, MR spectroscopy, perfusion imaging or histopathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants having undergone recent resection or open biopsy or stereotactic biopsy&#xD;
             of recurrent or progressive tumor will be eligible for Cohort 2 as long as the&#xD;
             following conditions apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  They have recovered from the effects of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Residual disease following resection of recurrent tumor is not mandated for&#xD;
                  eligibility. To best assess the extent of residual disease post-operatively, an&#xD;
                  MRI or CT scan should ideally have been performed no later than 96 hours&#xD;
                  following surgery, or at least 28 days post-operatively, but scans performed&#xD;
                  outside of this window are considered acceptable if no alternative is available.&#xD;
                  In either case, the baseline/screening MRI must be performed within 14 days prior&#xD;
                  to registration. If the participant is taking corticosteroids, the dose must be&#xD;
                  stable or decreasing for at least 5 days prior to the scan. If steroids are added&#xD;
                  or the steroid dose is increased between the date of the screening MRI or CT scan&#xD;
                  and the start of treatment, a new baseline MRI or CT is required.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  The effects of abemaciclib on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason,&#xD;
             women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP) must agree to use a medically approved&#xD;
             contraceptive method during the treatment period and for 3 months following the last&#xD;
             dose of abemaciclib. Men must agree to use a reliable method of birth control and to&#xD;
             not donate sperm during the study and for at least 3 months following the last dose of&#xD;
             abemaciclib. Contraceptive methods may include an intrauterine device [IUD] or barrier&#xD;
             method. If condoms are used as a barrier method, a spermicidal agent should be added&#xD;
             as a double barrier protection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  NOTE: Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they&#xD;
             have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical&#xD;
             profile (e.g., age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or six months of&#xD;
             spontaneous amenorrhea with serum FSH levels &gt; 40 mIU/mL and estradiol &lt; 20 pg/mL or&#xD;
             have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) at least six&#xD;
             weeks ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the&#xD;
             woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not&#xD;
             of child bearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 7&#xD;
             days prior to first dose of abemaciclib .&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
