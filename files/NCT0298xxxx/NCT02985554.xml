  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, dose escalation Phase I study to evaluate the tolerability and&#xD;
      efficacy of single agent of Nivolumab as maintenance treatment to prevent relapse in patients&#xD;
      with hematologic malignancies after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Approximately 29&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled, where about 6-12 patients will be included on the dose escalation&#xD;
      phase and 20 patients will be on the expansion cohort at maximal tolerated dose.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nivolumab will be administrated intravenously. Standard dose escalation will be used for the&#xD;
      intensification phase with starting dose at 1m/kg every 2 weeks for 4 doses. The DLT&#xD;
      observation period is 29 days starting with the first dose taken on Day 1, The study&#xD;
      treatment will continue until one of the discontinuation criteria is met. Each dose level&#xD;
      (1-2) will be tested using the 3+3 design. If level 2 of 3mg/kg is reached without DLTs,&#xD;
      3mg/kg will be used for the dose expansion cohort. After the intensification phase, patients&#xD;
      will start Nivolumab every 12 weeks maintenance phase till 2 years post allo-SCT. Patients&#xD;
      will also receive best supportive care (BSC), including blood product transfusions,&#xD;
      antimicrobials, and (as appropriate) granulocyte colony stimulating factors for neutropenic&#xD;
      infection or poor graft function.&#xD;

          -  Age ≥18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the&#xD;
             use of nivolumab in patients &lt;18 years of age, children are excluded from this study,&#xD;
             but will be eligible for future pediatric trials.&#xD;
&#xD;

          -  The effects of nivolumab on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason,&#xD;
             women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP) and men must agree to use adequate&#xD;
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study&#xD;
             entry and for the duration of study participation. WOCBP should use an adequate method&#xD;
             to avoid pregnancy for 23 weeks) after the last dose of investigational drug&#xD;
             Nivolumab. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine&#xD;
             pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 24&#xD;
             hours prior to the start of nivolumab. Women must not be breastfeeding. Men who are&#xD;
             sexually active with WOCBP must use any contraceptive method with a failure rate of&#xD;
             less than 1% per year. Men receiving nivolumab and who are sexually active with WOCBP&#xD;
             will be instructed to adhere to contraception for a period of 31 weeks after the last&#xD;
             dose of investigational product. Women who are not of childbearing potential (i.e.,&#xD;
             who are postmenopausal or surgically sterile as well as azoospermic men) do not&#xD;
             require contraception. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) is defined as any&#xD;
             female who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone surgical sterilization&#xD;
             (hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy) or who is not postmenopausal. Menopause is&#xD;
             defined clinically as 12 months of amenorrhea in a woman over 45 in the absence of&#xD;
             other biological or physiological causes. WOCBP receiving nivolumab will be instructed&#xD;
             to adhere to contraception for a period of 23 weeks (30 days plus the time required&#xD;
             for nivolumab to undergo five half-lives) after the last dose of investigational&#xD;
             product. Men receiving nivolumab and who are sexually active with WOCBP will be&#xD;
             instructed to adhere to contraception for a period of 31 weeks after the last dose of&#xD;
             investigational product. These durations have been calculated using the upper limit of&#xD;
             the half-life for nivolumab (25 days) and are based on the protocol requirement that&#xD;
             WOCBP use contraception for 5 half-lives plus 30 days and men who are sexually active&#xD;
             with WOCBP use contraception for 5 half-lives plus 90 days. Should a woman become&#xD;
             pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this&#xD;
             study, she (or the participating partner) should inform the treating physician&#xD;
             immediately. 18&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergy to study drug components.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have disease relapse, active GVHD or history of more than Stage 1 skin&#xD;

             toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for&#xD;
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not&#xD;
             recovered from adverse events (AEs) due to agents administered more than 4 weeks&#xD;
             earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known CNS involvement may be excluded because of poor prognosis and&#xD;
             concerns regarding progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the&#xD;
             evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events. However, if CNS disease is cleared&#xD;
             before the treatment with Nivolumab, patients could be allowed if no permanent CNS&#xD;
             damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of severe hypersensitivity reaction to any monoclonal antibody.&#xD;

             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because Nivolumab is an agent with the&#xD;
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but&#xD;
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with Nivolumab, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated&#xD;
             with Nivolumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known history of testing positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)&#xD;
             or known acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) might be enrolled if the viral load&#xD;

             or hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (HCV antibody) indicating acute or chronic&#xD;
             infection might be enrolled if the viral load by PCR is undetectable with/without&#xD;

             and patients with a history of toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson&#xD;
             syndrome, or phospholipid syndrome should be excluded because of the risk of&#xD;
             recurrence or exacerbation of disease. Patients with vitiligo, endocrine deficiencies&#xD;
             including thyroiditis managed with replacement hormones including physiologic&#xD;
             corticosteroids are eligible. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis and other&#xD;
