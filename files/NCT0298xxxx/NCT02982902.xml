  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a specific type of cell-based immunotherapy,&#xD;
      using T-cells from a donor that are specific against cytomegalovirus (CMV) is feasible to&#xD;
      treat infections by CMV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adoptive T-cell therapy is an investigational (experimental) therapy that works by using the&#xD;
      blood of a donor and selecting the T-cells that can respond against a specific infectious&#xD;
      entity. These selected T-cells are then infused to the patient, to try to give the immune&#xD;
      system the ability to fight the infection. Adoptive T-cell therapy is experimental because it&#xD;
      is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the feasibility of the treatment of&#xD;
      opportunistic cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections after hematopoietic stem cell transplant&#xD;
      (HSCT) with virus-specific, antigen-selected T-cells, selected using the CliniMACS prodigy&#xD;
      system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective(s)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the safety profile of the infusion of CMV- specific, antigen selected&#xD;
           T-cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the toxicities related to infusion of CMV- specific, antigen selected&#xD;
           T-cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the rate of eradication of opportunistic CMV infections after HSCT and and&#xD;
           treatment with CMV-specific, antigen-selected T-cells using the CliniMACS Prodigy&#xD;
           System.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This feasibility study will include a single treatment cohort.&#xD;

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Eradication rate of opportunistic CMV infections</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 100 days after transplant</time_frame>
    <description>The eradication rate will be the disappearance of opportunistic CMV infections with the use of CMV-specific, antigen-selected T cells using the CliniMACS Prodigy System over the total number CMV infections.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>response rate</measure>
