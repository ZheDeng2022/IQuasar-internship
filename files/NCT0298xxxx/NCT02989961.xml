  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety of Resticutis for the treatment of&#xD;
      Wagner's Grade II/III diabetic foot ulcers in comparison with Platelet-Poor Plasma as a&#xD;
      placebo comparator.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Grade II and III (According to Wagner's classification system of Ulcer severity) are&#xD;
      considered to be of the most common complications associated with Diabetes, which are mostly&#xD;
      hard to heal using the conventional treatment methods which by consequence severely affects&#xD;
      the quality and lifestyle of the diabetes patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It's thought that the application of Autologous activated platelets &quot;Resticutis&quot; which&#xD;
      secretes huge amounts of growth factors is capable of giving better results of which are: the&#xD;
      stimulation of the healing process that includes contraction, granulation, tissue formation&#xD;
      and epithelialization of the diabetic foot ulcer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resticutis is obtained from an autologous 20 mL peripheral blood withdrawn in tubes&#xD;
      containing 3.8% Sodium Citrate. Blood is then centrifuged to obtain Platelet-Rich Plasma&#xD;
      -PRP- as per established method. PRP is then activated in a closed system by physical methods&#xD;
      to obtain a final product of 5 mL of Resticutis which is injected intra-lesionally at ulcer&#xD;
      margins per each session of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It's hypothesized that a total of six injections throughout the period of the treatment are&#xD;
      enough to achieve full closure of the DFU. The injections are given on days: 0,14,28,42,56,&#xD;
      and 70 of the treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The consenting patients will be randomized into 2 groups: One group will be given Resticutis,&#xD;
      and the second one Platelet-Poor Plasma PPP as placebo. If patients in PPP group didn't&#xD;
      achieve full healing after four-six injections, they're given a two weeks rest after which&#xD;
      they are given Resticutis instead.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is mainly a phase 1 safety study, which means no formal statistical analysis will be&#xD;
      applied to any of the data. Safety assessment will depend on the association of any adverse&#xD;
      events during the course of the study, and efficacy as a secondary objective will be assessed&#xD;
      by observing the healing time of DFUs.&#xD;
