  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mindfulness-based interventions have gained increasing popularity in recent years as&#xD;
      effective treatment for mental illness. Mindfulness is defined as paying attention in a&#xD;
      particular way: on purpose, in the present moment, and non-judgmentally: &quot;Being&quot;, rather than&#xD;
      &quot;Doing&quot;. Such mental states can improve emotional regulation through frontal cortex&#xD;
      inhibition of otherwise dysregulated subcortical emotion-related circuits. Formal mindfulness&#xD;
      approaches such as mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) and mindfulness-based stress&#xD;
      reduction, have been highly effective in a broad range of psychiatric disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mindfulness-oriented interventions, are potentially useful in acute psychiatric&#xD;
      hospitalizations, since they can be delivered as group therapies and are be both&#xD;
      cost-effective and scalable. However, such interventions have rarely been provided to&#xD;
      patients during psychiatric hospitalizations, where patients are treated for a variety of&#xD;
      psychiatric diagnoses, and may have unpredictable lengths of stay. Additionally, there had&#xD;
      been concerns that longer traditional mindfulness based interventions (e.g. 30 minute silent&#xD;
      meditation) may exacerbate acute psychosis. However, strong evidence suggests that patients&#xD;
      with psychotic symptoms appear to be largely unaffected by shorter interventions. Similarly,&#xD;
      MBCT have been helpful to treat other major reasons for hospitalization such as: bipolar&#xD;
      disorder, severe anxiety, substance use disorders, and major depressive disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Few studies have examined mindfulness-oriented treatments in inpatient settings, including&#xD;
      two small studies involving mindfulness groups on an acute psychiatric inpatient ward (n&lt;10)&#xD;
      . Another study (n=23) offered inpatients with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder&#xD;
      mindfulness-based activities. All studies concluded that mindfulness-oriented approaches in&#xD;
      inpatient settings were feasible, although these needed to be brief interventions, given the&#xD;
      risks and lack of efficacy of longer MBI (e.g. 40-minute silent meditation) in severe mental&#xD;
      illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cross-sectional study conducted by our team (n=40) demonstrated that brief group&#xD;
      mindfulness-oriented lasting 10 minutes were very well tolerated by 92.5% of psychiatric&#xD;
      inpatients. The remaining 7.5% of patients left the session before 10-minutes, but had no&#xD;
      symptomatic exacerbations or adverse effects. Moreover, the 50% of patients self- reported&#xD;
      improvements in general well-being and mood after a single 10-minute session. Having been&#xD;
      recently admitted to the psychiatric inpatient or having a diagnosis of acute psychosis (75%&#xD;
      of inpatients) did not affect patients' capacity to tolerate and benefit from the&#xD;
      intervention. In this inpatient psychiatric population, we found that mindfulness-oriented&#xD;
      interventions that were brief and involved physical movement (e.g. seated Tai Chi) were&#xD;
      better enjoyed compared to other interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the growing literature in this field, data is needed on the effectiveness and health&#xD;
      service implications of brief group mindfulness-oriented interventions in inpatient&#xD;
      psychiatry settings. Outcome studies conducted so far cannot be interpreted reliably due to&#xD;
      methodological flaws, including inadequate control groups, very small sample sizes (often&#xD;
      n&lt;10), and lack of randomization. In Canada, the direct cost of treatment for mental illness&#xD;
      is estimated as 42.3 billion. Much of these costs are driven by psychiatric admissions. Thus,&#xD;
      if brief mindfulness-oriented interventions are effective at lowering psychiatric symptom&#xD;
      severity and shortening psychiatric hospitalizations, this could lead to significant&#xD;
      cost-savings.&#xD;
