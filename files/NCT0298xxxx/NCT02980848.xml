  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC) ADVANCE study is a large, observational&#xD;
      pragmatic comparative effectiveness research study using high-quality, prospectively&#xD;
      collected data from BCSC registries to generate evidence on how breast density should be&#xD;
      integrated into decision making around breast cancer screening and preoperative diagnostic&#xD;
      work-up. We will augment existing BCSC registry infrastructure with additional prospective&#xD;
      data collection and collection of patient reported outcomes (PROs), CISNET modeling of&#xD;
      long-term screening outcomes, and qualitative data from focus groups with women represented&#xD;
      in two aims.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aim 1: Compare the effectiveness of breast cancer screening using digital mammography alone&#xD;
      versus digital mammography plus supplemental screening (digital breast tomosynthesis or MRI)&#xD;
      by extent of breast density.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub aim 1: Evaluate whether the performance of tomosynthesis improves with years of&#xD;
      experience, and whether any &quot;learning curve&quot; depends on radiologist specialty (i.e., breast&#xD;
      imaging specialist vs. general radiologist).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Compare the effectiveness of preoperative MRI versus no MRI by extent of breast&#xD;
      density among women with an initial, pathologically confirmed diagnosis of DCIS or invasive&#xD;
      breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Covid-19 Enhancement Aim and Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Develop patient-focused messaging content through focus groups that radiology facilities can&#xD;
      use when scheduling appointments to inform women of the safety to schedule or postpone breast&#xD;
      screening or diagnostic services.&#xD;

        This study will include women age 40-79 undergoing screening mammography (Aim 1) and women&#xD;
        age ≥18 with a first breast cancer diagnosis (Aim 2). We will include women in the BCSC&#xD;
        cohort with mammography from 2005-2017. BCSC participants are identified from seven BCSC&#xD;
        breast imaging registries. The BCSC prospectively collects data during routine clinical&#xD;
        practice through voluntary partnerships with radiology facilities. Women enter the BCSC&#xD;
        cohort when they receive a breast-imaging exam at a participating facility.&#xD;
