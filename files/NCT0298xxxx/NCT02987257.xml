    <textblock>
      The NATIENS study is a phase III randomized study to examine the optimal treatment and&#xD;
      mechanisms of each of two treatments (cyclosporine 5 mg/kg bid for 14 days versus etanercept&#xD;
      50 mg subcutaneously at day 0 and day 3) versus the current standard of care which is&#xD;
      harmonized supportive care for the treatment of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and toxic epidermal&#xD;
      necrolysis (SJS/TEN). SJS/TEN is typically a drug-induced disease in adults with a mortality&#xD;
      of up to 50% or higher in elderly adults. Although progress has been made in elucidating&#xD;
      strong genetic risk factors that have led to pre-prescription screening and prevention the&#xD;
      risk factors for most drugs and ethnicities represented in the United States are currently&#xD;
      unknown. Currently there are a number of small observational studies and a non-blinded small&#xD;
      randomized study however there is no strong or definitive evidence base to support any one&#xD;
      treatment intervention over supportive care alone and this remains considered a standard of&#xD;
      care for SJS/TEN. The primary objective of the study is to conduct a randomized double-blind&#xD;
      double dummy stratified multicenter phase III study across 24 sites across the Unites States&#xD;
      to determine whether two therapeutic interventions (etanercept versus cyclosporine) will&#xD;
      improve short-term outcomes associated with SJS/TEN. The primary hypothesis of this study is&#xD;
      that both etanercept and cyclosporine will show benefit over supportive care alone and that&#xD;
      single dose etanercept 50 mg sc at days 0 and repeated 72 hours following initial dosing will&#xD;
      show significant benefit over cyclosporine 5 mg/kg bid and supportive care alone. Our&#xD;
      secondary outcomes are to determine the clinical outcomes at 3 and 12 months following&#xD;
      initial presentation and to determine the molecular and cellular mechanisms of SJS/TEN&#xD;
      through collection of timed samples to include DNA, RNA, PBMCs, blister cells and supernatant&#xD;
      and skin. We hypothesize that patients will have significant sequelae identified at 3 and 12&#xD;
      months that will differ between treatment arms and that treatment interventions will&#xD;
      significantly impact cytotoxic and cytokine signals with these biomarkers correlating with&#xD;
      primary and secondary outcome. We also hypothesize that significant genetic associations will&#xD;
      be found in association with drug-induced SJS/TEN. Eligible patients are &gt;/= 18 who meet&#xD;
      evidence for SJS/TEN clinical criteria as evidence by erythematous/dusky macules coalescing&#xD;
      or denuded skin and blistering with positive Nikolsky sign which is mandatory criteria&#xD;
      associated with mucous membrane involvement, prodromal symptoms including fever, myalgia and&#xD;
      headache, increasing number of lesions and history of a medication. To continue with the&#xD;
      study patients must meet pathological criteria. Randomization will occur by a secure central&#xD;
      online computer-generated random number system through REDCap. Subjects will be allocated&#xD;
      1:1:1 to cyclosporine plus best supportive care, etanercept plus best supportive care or best&#xD;
      supportive care alone. Patients, treating physician and outcome assessors will be blinded to&#xD;
      the allocated treatment. The primary outcome of the study is time to complete&#xD;
      re-epithelialization as defined by complete absence of erosion and compromised skin. Time to&#xD;
      expected re-epithelialization of 21 days is the maximum healing time with supportive care in&#xD;
      SJS/TEN patients which reflects the healing time of adult skin. The primary outcome will be&#xD;
      independently assessed by the treating team to include any of a burn surgeon, dermatologist&#xD;
      or wound specialist. Disagreement will be solved by independent adjudication by a minimum of&#xD;
      two reviewers. Patients who have to discontinue a study medication will be analyzed by&#xD;
      intent-to-treat analysis and followed for complications of SJS/TEN as per study protocol.&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes of the study include: 1)time to halting of progression of SJS/TEN skin&#xD;
      disease. Progression will be considered significant if there are any new blisters or erosions&#xD;
      and halting of progression is defined as absence of these criteria with any new lesions; 2)&#xD;
      all-cause mortality at 30 days, 3 months and 1 year following symptoms onset; 3) composite&#xD;
      cause-specific mortality - outcome including death from sepsis, multi-organ failure and acute&#xD;
      respiratory distress syndrome; 4) actual mortality versus expected mortality (as calculated&#xD;
      by SCORTEN); 5) Time to cessation of acute ocular involvement (this will be tracked by the&#xD;
      same serial photography evaluated by two independent Ophthalmology experts in SJS/TEN eye&#xD;
      disease; 6) incidence of infections; 7) hospital length of stay; 8) adverse events due to&#xD;
      therapy; 9) serial plasma granulysin, IL-15 concentrations (and other relevant&#xD;
      biomarkers);10) Follow-up 3 months and 1 year from initial presentation for physical and&#xD;
      mental health complications. For aims 2 and 3 a number of mechanistic studies will be&#xD;
      performed on paired samples (DNA, RNA, PBMCs, plasma, blister fluid and skin).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background and Scientific Rationale Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal&#xD;
      necrolysis (TEN), are severe, life-threatening immunologically mediated adverse drug&#xD;
      reactions representing the same disease across a spectrum of severity that affects 60,000&#xD;
      patients per year globally at an incidence of 5 cases per 1,000,000 in the United States.&#xD;
      This study has been preceded by a planning phase to ensure the testing and development of&#xD;
      standardized infrastructure and operating procedures across sites. The scientific rationale&#xD;
      for this study is the lack of evidence-based treatment for SJS/TEN. The study will aim to&#xD;
      establish the most clinically effective therapy for SJS/TEN, as there is currently no level&#xD;
      1A evidence for any treatment above aggressive supportive care which still has equipoise as&#xD;
      to the standard of care. A multi-centered, three-arm, double-blind double-dummy randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial with a planned enrollment of 267 patients over 6 years will be undertaken to&#xD;
      evaluate which of supportive care, cyclosporine or etanercept leads to the shortest time to&#xD;
      complete re-epithelialization. The controlled setting of the clinical trial provides the&#xD;
      basis for which samples can be sequentially collected to answer important mechanistic&#xD;
      questions. Samples collected in the course of the study will include DNA, RNA, plasma, serum,&#xD;
      blister fluid cells and supernatant, sloughed epidermis, and punch biopsies of skin. Samples&#xD;
      will be biobanked to do immediate targeted high-resolution HLA sequencing, cytokine&#xD;
      profiling, and single-cell multidimensional analyses to identify biological markers that have&#xD;
      the potential to predict the risk and outcome of SJS/TEN. A pharmacokinetic study to assess&#xD;
      the disposition of cyclosporine and etanercept will be done on a subset of patients. Samples&#xD;
      will be biobank for later analysis for other transcriptomic, proteomic whole-genome studies.&#xD;
      These mechanistic studies will allow us to gain important insights into the&#xD;
      immunopathogenesis of SJS/TEN. Our study will be the first to examine in a blinded randomized&#xD;
      controlled design both management and mechanisms of SJS/TEN. We anticipate that this will&#xD;
      lead to new ways to prevent, diagnose and treat SJS/TEN, and will create a roadmap and&#xD;
      evidence-based for studies in serious immunologically mediated adverse drug reactions and&#xD;
      other immunologically mediated diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions Supportive care is the currently accepted standard of care of SJS/TEN. Systemic&#xD;
      treatment of SJS/TEN and the preferred agents remain a matter of debate and contention.&#xD;
      Observational studies performed over the last 15 years suggest that cyclosporine and&#xD;
      etanercept may be promising treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Study Hypotheses/Objectives 1.1. Hypotheses Our primary hypothesis is that both&#xD;
           cyclosporine and etanercept will show benefit over supportive care alone and that&#xD;
           etanercept 50 mg subcutaneously given at study day 1 and repeated at day 4. We further&#xD;
           hypothesize that we will discover a number of genetic and biological predictors of both&#xD;
           occurrence and prognosis of SJS/TEN including genetic associations (HLA and others),&#xD;
           cytokine biomarkers that predict that course, and the likelihood of re-epithelialization&#xD;
           and single-cell multidimensional studies that will identify promising targets for&#xD;
           prognosis and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2. Primary Objective(s) Our primary objective is to conduct a 25-site three-arm&#xD;
           randomized double-blind controlled stratified multicenter phase III study to determine&#xD;
           whether two therapeutic interventions - cyclosporine and etanercept will improve&#xD;
           short-term outcomes associated with Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and toxic epidermal&#xD;
           necrolysis (SJS/TEN) over harmonized best supportive care alone. Our hypothesis is that&#xD;
           both etanercept and cyclosporine will show benefit over supportive care alone and that&#xD;
           etanercept 50 mg subcutaneously on study day 0 and repeated 72 hours later on study day&#xD;
           3 for all subjects will show significant benefit over both cyclosporine and supportive&#xD;
           care alone. The justification for a second dose is the short half-life of the drug and&#xD;
           the usual twice a week dosing in other skin conditions such as psoriasis and a recent&#xD;
           non-blinded randomized study of etanercept in SJS/TEN that used repeat dosing of&#xD;
           etanercept.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary Objective(s) Secondary objectives of this study are to determine the acute&#xD;
           secondary outcomes and secondary clinical outcomes at 3 and 12 months (see secondary&#xD;
           outcomes) and to determine the molecular and cellular mechanisms of SJS/TEN through the&#xD;
           collection of timed DNA, PBMC, RNA, blister fluid and blister fluid cells and skin. We&#xD;
           hypothesize that patients will have significant sequelae identified at 3 and 12 months&#xD;
           that will differ between treatment arms. We hypothesis that treatment interventions will&#xD;
           significantly impact cytotoxic and cytokine signals and that these biomarkers will&#xD;
           correlate with primary and secondary outcomes. We further hypothesize that significant&#xD;
           genetic associations (in particular class I HLA) will be found in association with&#xD;
           drug-induced SJS/TEN.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study Design 2.1. Description of Study Design This is a three-arm, randomized,&#xD;
           double-blind double-dummy phase III multicenter placebo-controlled trial comparing&#xD;
           cyclosporine, etanercept, and best supportive care for the treatment of SJS/TEN. A total&#xD;
           enrollment of 267 subjects (89 per arm) over 24 sites is planned. The sample size is&#xD;
           based on a 90% power to determine the primary outcome and a minimum clinically important&#xD;
           difference (MCID) of one day for full re-epithelialization of the skin. The study will&#xD;
           enroll from multiple sites due to the low SJS/TEN incidence at individual sites and the&#xD;
           need to identify patients with very specific inclusion criteria including those who have&#xD;
           had no more than a 5-day window from onset of symptoms to presentation. We aim to&#xD;
           complete enrollment over a period of 6 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Consenting adult subjects (≥18 years of age) who meet clinical criteria for diagnosis of&#xD;
           SJS/TEN will undergo randomization stratified by baseline SJS/TEN prognosis (SCORTEN)&#xD;
           and will be allocated 1:1:1 to cyclosporine plus best supportive care, etanercept plus&#xD;
           best supportive care or best supportive care alone. Randomization will occur by a secure&#xD;
           central online, computer-generated random randomization tool in REDCap using permuted&#xD;
           blocks of sizes 3 and 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The active treatment period is from randomization until re-epithelialization is&#xD;
           achieved. This is expected to be at most 21 days. The primary outcome is time (days) to&#xD;
           full re-epithelialization of the skin. Subjects will be followed in the hospital during&#xD;
           their admission; patients with SJS/TEN in this study will be on active drug or placebo&#xD;
           intravenously for at least 14 days. The plan will be the earliest discharge from the&#xD;
           hospital to occur at the completion of the full 14 days of placebo versus active&#xD;
           treatment if full re-epithelialization has occurred at that time but not until complete&#xD;
           re-epithelialization. Death is a competing risk for the primary outcome (see statistical&#xD;
           plan section 4.4). Subjects will be followed for 3 months and 12 months after complete&#xD;
           re-epithelialization. Under circumstances where patients are inadvertently discharged&#xD;
           prior to complete re-epithelialization appropriate and comparable follow-up to provide&#xD;
           documentation of appropriate wound, eye, and urogynecological care and of the timing of&#xD;
           complete re-epithelialization at a clinical research center at supportive sites and/or&#xD;
           the Hawthorne effect clinical trials services (see operations manual).&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.2. Stratification, Randomization, and Blinding/Masking&#xD;
&#xD;
           Randomization will occur by a secure central online, computer-generated random number&#xD;
           system in REDCap. Randomization will be stratified by baseline SJS/TEN prognosis&#xD;
           (SCORTEN) and will occur in randomly varying blocks of sizes 3 and 6. Subjects will be&#xD;
           allocated 1:1:1 to cyclosporine plus best supportive care, etanercept plus best&#xD;
           supportive care, or best supportive care alone. Patients, treating physicians and&#xD;
           outcome assessors will be blinded to the allocated treatment. All patients will receive&#xD;
           supportive care, either with a double placebo or with their study drug (cyclosporine or&#xD;
           etanercept) plus placebo. The central randomization scheme will provide the site&#xD;
           pharmacist with a unique drug code corresponding to either study drugs and matching&#xD;
           placebos. These will be kept in identical, coded containers. Only the study central&#xD;
           pharmacy and the site pharmacy who will prepare the preparations for blinding will be&#xD;
           aware of the coding scheme. Masking will be carried out as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cyclosporine: The study drug is given as per protocol for 2 weeks. A single SC&#xD;
                injection is given on study day 0 of admission and study day 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Etanercept: Study drug given as per protocol on study days 0 and 3. Receive IV&#xD;
                normal saline for 2 weeks to mimic the cyclosporine schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Supportive therapy: A single saline SC injection on study day 0 and study day 3 of&#xD;
                admission and an additional 14 days of IV normal saline placebo to mimic the&#xD;
                cyclosporine schedule 2.2.1. Procedure for Unblinding/Unmasking Unblinding must be&#xD;
                approved by the study medical monitor unless an immediately life-threatening&#xD;
                condition has developed, and the medical monitor is not available. The site&#xD;
                investigator will notify the protocol chair(s) and the study statistical and&#xD;
                clinical coordinating center of the unblinding event by the next business day. The&#xD;
                emergency unblinding will also be reported to the Data and Safety Monitoring Board&#xD;
                (DSMB). A full account of the event will be recorded, including the date, time of&#xD;
                the unblinding, the reason or the decision to unblind and the name of the&#xD;
                individual who made the decision and the names of the Medical Monitor, and others&#xD;
                who were notified. The reasons for unblinding of a participant's treatment will be&#xD;
                included in the final study report. Unblinding the study due to an approved interim&#xD;
                analysis, final analysis, or study termination will require written approval from&#xD;
                the institute sponsor (NIAID).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Selection of Participants and Clinical Sites/Laboratories 3.1. Rationale for Study&#xD;
           Population Subject enrollment will reflect the population at large in our participating&#xD;
           centers. All subjects who meet inclusion criteria will be screened for enrollment into&#xD;
           the study. We will not discriminate based on sex, race, or ethnicity. Females, including&#xD;
           those of childbearing potential, will be included in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Supportive care High-quality supportive care is always used in the treatment of SJS/TEN.&#xD;
           We know it can decrease the chance of serious complications and death even in the&#xD;
           absence of adjuvant medications to treat the condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
           There are no significant side effects associated with supportive care aside from&#xD;
           possible discomfort with dressing changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.5. Risks of Other Protocol Specified Medications Cyclosporine&#xD;
&#xD;
           The risks of the venipuncture (bruising at the site and very low risk of infection)&#xD;
           apply as cyclosporine is an intravenous medication. There is extensive experience with&#xD;
           this medication in SJS/TEN for the treatment of other conditions. In general, few side&#xD;
           effects have been seen when used for SJS/TEN. When they have occurred, they have had no&#xD;
           long-term impact on the person receiving the medication. Risks include:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Less likely (5% to 20%):&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Mild changes in kidney function: 1-6% had mild changes in their kidney function&#xD;
                that required a change of dose; Serious infections were not more common than those&#xD;
                treated with short-term use, as proposed in this study. Flu-like illness symptoms&#xD;
                and a predisposition for lung infections have been experienced in 8- 10% of&#xD;
                patients with long-term use (months to years).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Rare (1% to 4%):&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Hypertension: 1-3% needed to have their blood pressure lowered. Very rare but serious&#xD;
           (less than 1%): Severe liver or kidney problems may be permanent in those taking&#xD;
           cyclosporine for greater than one 1year. Patients receiving cyclosporine under the&#xD;
           NATIENS protocol will undergo treatment for a short amount of time; therefore, the&#xD;
           chance of this occurring in this study is extremely unlikely. Close monitoring for&#xD;
           hepatic or renal dysfunction is built into the NATIENS study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Discontinuing the study medication in the case of imminently organ-threatening effects,&#xD;
           type I allergy, or rare immune reactions (e.g., thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura] in&#xD;
           the case of cyclosporine) will be documented. Cyclosporine would be the only arm where&#xD;
           this may occur as the protocol is for 2 weeks of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           An investigator and research coordinator will be available 24 hours a day from both the&#xD;
           Vanderbilt Coordinating Center and Ottawa Coordinating Center. The consent form has&#xD;
           contact numbers for reaching study personnel. In the event an investigator or research&#xD;
           coordinator is on vacation or out-of-town, appropriate coverage will be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The safety of the participant will remain of primary importance. All patients will&#xD;
           undergo intensive monitoring while in hospital in accordance with usual ICU and Burn&#xD;
           Unit practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.6. Risks of Study Procedures Venipuncture and Blood Samples: The protocol requires&#xD;
           patients to have blood drawn for research purposes. The risks of drawing blood are&#xD;
           uncommon and may include bleeding, minor infection, and bruising. Blood draws may be&#xD;
           painful. Some people may feel faint or dizzy. The amount of blood drawn represents a&#xD;
           small percentage of the amount of the total blood volume and will not represent a&#xD;
           significant risk to the patient. Samples are planned to align with blood samples taken&#xD;
           in the course of usual clinical care to minimize the need for repeat venipuncture. Blood&#xD;
           sampling is performed by trained nurses or phlebotomists with experience performing&#xD;
           venipuncture. We have also aligned our study-related blood samples with those taken for&#xD;
           usual patient care. Multiple tests are also performed on blood from the same sample&#xD;
           tubes. This minimizes the volume of blood required to complete Aims 2 and 3 as well as&#xD;
           significantly reduces the number of needle sticks.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Tissue Samples: Tissue samples will be taken to understand the disease process of&#xD;
           SJS/TEN. A sample of healthy skin, where possible, will be taken for comparison. Where&#xD;
           samples of normal skin can be taken, this will be discussed with the patient. Some&#xD;
           patients have little healthy skin to sample. Risks primarily include minor bleeding, a&#xD;
           small chance of infection, and a small scar.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All tissue sampling will be done by an experienced physician to reduce the risk of&#xD;
           complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Salivary Swab: There are no significant risks associated with the saliva samples being&#xD;
           collected. In those with oral mucosal involvement due to SJS/TEN, there may be&#xD;
           irritation or a small degree of discomfort while producing a sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Blister Fluid Collection: This process involves aspirating fluid from an intact blister.&#xD;
           There is a very low risk of infection, but there is no discomfort with the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Investigational Agent /Device/Intervention (see investigators brochure, section 5) 4.1.&#xD;
           Drug Accountability Under Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (21CFR §312.62),&#xD;
           the investigator will maintain adequate records of the disposition of the&#xD;
           investigational agent, including the date and quantity of the drug received, to whom the&#xD;
           drug was dispensed (participant-by-participant accounting), and a detailed accounting of&#xD;
           any drug accidentally or deliberately destroyed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Records for receipt, storage, use, and disposition will be maintained by the study site.&#xD;
           A drug-dispensing log will be kept current for each participant. This log will contain&#xD;
           the identification of each participant and the date and quantity of drug dispensed. All&#xD;
           records regarding the disposition of the investigational product will be available for&#xD;
           inspection. Any remaining product will be destroyed in accordance with pharmacy&#xD;
           regulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.2. Assessment of Participant Compliance with Investigational Agent All medications&#xD;
           will be administered by the investigator and/or study staff in the Burn Unit.&#xD;
           Administration of study medication(s) will be witnessed by the investigator and/or study&#xD;
           staff. The total volume of study medication-infused will be compared with the total&#xD;
           volume prepared to determine compliance with each dose administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.3. Toxicity Prevention and Management Etanercept: No modifications are permitted.&#xD;
           Cyclosporine: The study is blinded and the adjustment and stopping rules that primarily&#xD;
           apply to cyclosporine will be carried out by an unblinded pharmacists according to&#xD;
           well-defined rules. A table will be provided for anticipated severe drug interactions&#xD;
           with cyclosporine and for patients where those drugs are necessary these patients may be&#xD;
           excluded from the study. Non-serious medication side-effects such as diastolic&#xD;
           hypertension or mild renal failure will be medically managed while still maintaining&#xD;
           blinding. For example, standard adjustments for cyclosporine will be made based on serum&#xD;
           creatinine and blood pressure monitoring. These orders will be written and carried out&#xD;
           by an unblinded pharmacist. The adjusted dose will appear on the IV bag&#xD;
           cyclosporine/placebo and the treating team will remain blinded as to the treatment arm&#xD;
           of the patient. Creatinine will be monitored daily by a non-blinded pharmacist at each&#xD;
           site for all patients. A standard dose-adjustment algorithm to maintain a target&#xD;
           creatinine of &lt;130% above baseline will be used. Down-dosing of 25-30% will be used if&#xD;
           diastolic blood pressure &gt;100 mm. If &gt;3 dose adjustments, 48-hours apart fail to control&#xD;
           rises in creatinine beyond this threshold, cyclosporine is stopped. Any study treatment&#xD;
           will also be stopped in the presence of any grade 3-4 toxicity (e.g.&#xD;
           leukoencephalopathy) or creatinine &gt;150% of initial value and diastolic blood pressure&#xD;
           &gt;110 or systolic persistently &gt; 160 mmHg which is a common indicator of cyclosporine&#xD;
           toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
           6.5 Premature Discontinuation of Investigational Agent Patients who discontinue any&#xD;
           study medication will be analyzed by intent-to-treat analysis and followed for&#xD;
           complications of SJS/TEN as per study protocol. Stopping for lack of efficacy will occur&#xD;
           according to pre-described stopping rules. Study therapy may be prematurely discontinued&#xD;
           for any participant for any of the following reasons:1. Grade 3 or 4 toxicity 2.&#xD;
           Toxicity that has not responded to clinical management (see cyclosporine above); 3.&#xD;
           Necessary medication that interacts with cyclosporine (as per protocol table) 4. Patient&#xD;
           request. All patients are administered the drug in the ICU and are monitored around the&#xD;
           clock for adverse signs and symptoms by the investigator and/or study staff. If adverse&#xD;
           signs are observed, patients will be evaluated by physicians from various specialties&#xD;
           including intensive care, and dermatology. Following evaluations, decisions will be&#xD;
           taken to decrease, adjust, or stop the dosage. Each site will be individually managed&#xD;
           for treating adverse reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Study therapy may also be prematurely discontinued for any participant if the&#xD;
           investigator believes that the study treatment is no longer in the best interest of the&#xD;
           participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Other Medications 5.1. Concomitant Medications 5.1.1. Protocol-mandated 1% lidocaine&#xD;
           with epinephrine at a dilution of 1:100,000 as local anesthesia at the time of&#xD;
           obtainment of biopsy samples (for research biopsies) 5.1.2. Other permitted concomitant&#xD;
           medications All topical agents for wound and eye care are permitted as outlined in the&#xD;
           respective supportive care protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.2. Prophylactic Medications Any non-interacting medications (as per cyclosporine&#xD;
           protocol) may be administered at the discretion of the clinical team.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.3. Prohibited Medications 1) Medications that interact with cyclosporine where there&#xD;
           are suitable alternatives20,21; 2) immunomodulatory agents other than those used in this&#xD;
           clinical trial&#xD;
&#xD;
           The following medications will be considered to be contraindicated during the course of&#xD;
           the study. If patients are on these medications and an alternative is available it&#xD;
           should be substituted:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Aliskiren, atorvastatin, bosentan, cholic acid, cladribine, conivaptan, crizotinib,&#xD;
           dronedarone, elagolix, enzalutamide, eplerenone, foscarnet, any new drug found to be a&#xD;
           significant CYP3A4 inhibitor or p-glycoprotein/ABCB1 inhibitor). A complete list of&#xD;
           interacting drugs, potentially interacting drugs is included in the operations manual.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.4. Rescue Medications Cyclosporine increases blood pressure. Blood pressure will be&#xD;
           managed by administering non-interacting blood pressure-lowering drugs at the discretion&#xD;
           of the treating physician. Cyclosporine could also decrease renal function. Patients&#xD;
           will be managed as per standard of care protocols for patients with acute renal failure&#xD;
           (see operations manual for detailed procedures).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Study procedures (for laboratory procedures and sampling schedule, see section 5,&#xD;
           comprehensive laboratory plan) Enrollment The research study will be explained in lay&#xD;
           terms to each potential research participant. The potential participant will sign an&#xD;
           informed consent form before undergoing any study procedures. Once informed consent has&#xD;
           been signed and completed by both the participant and key study personnel, the&#xD;
           participant is considered enrolled in the study and will be assigned a unique&#xD;
           participant number. Consent will be obtained at the time of clinical encounter or&#xD;
           diagnosis. To initially identify patients for consent, medical records may be reviewed&#xD;
           for suitability or the admitting service (e.g., emergency, intensive care unit, burn&#xD;
           surgery) may identify suitable patients to the study team. Then, a health care&#xD;
           professional from the research team of key personnel will discuss the study with&#xD;
           prospective participants (or substitute decision-makers) or obtain permission for the&#xD;
           research personnel to discuss the study. In rare cases where emergency treatment is&#xD;
           required (e.g., altered level of consciousness, lack of capacity), enrollment may still&#xD;
           occur; however, confirmation of consent will be required by the research team at the&#xD;
           first opportunity after the patient is initially managed or restoration of capacity&#xD;
           occurs. Consent will be obtained from a substitute decision-maker or the patient at the&#xD;
           earliest possible moment and the subject will be reconsented when their capacity for&#xD;
           medical decision-making returns. A copy of the patient's consent will be kept in the&#xD;
           patient's chart. It is available in English and Spanish. If consent is withdrawn at any&#xD;
           time, it should be determined to what aspect of the study consent is being withdrawn&#xD;
           (e.g., consent to the use of genetic samples or the study itself). In case of full&#xD;
           withdrawal of consent, the treating team may modify any of the study procedures as per&#xD;
           their medical judgment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8.1 Screening/Baseline Visit The purpose of the screening period is to confirm eligibility to&#xD;
      continue in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following procedures, assessments, and laboratory measures will be conducted to determine&#xD;
      participant eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Research staff will screen potential participants upon being notified of their admission&#xD;
           to the ICU or Burn ICU based on the study inclusion/exclusion criteria. (so as written&#xD;
           here - the subjects will be screened and consented here).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A diagnostic punch biopsy will be obtained from the patient on the day of admission by&#xD;
           the institution's appropriate staff. (is this a clinical biopsy or a research biopsy)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The results of the diagnostic biopsy will be reviewed by research staff to determine&#xD;
           eligibility to continue in the study within 2-3 days after admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: will occur by a secure central online, computer-generated random number&#xD;
      system. Randomization will be stratified by baseline SJS/TEN prognosis (SCORTEN) and will&#xD;
      occur in randomly varying blocks of sizes 3 and 6. Subjects will be allocated 1:1:1 to&#xD;
      cyclosporine plus best supportive care, etanercept plus best supportive care, or best&#xD;
      supportive care alone. Continuation of the patient in the study will be contingent on a&#xD;
      compatible clinical picture in combination with supportive pathology. Since pathology can&#xD;
      take 48 hours to come back however subject randomization will occur prior to the availability&#xD;
      of the biopsy results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients, treating physicians, and outcome assessors will be blinded to the allocated&#xD;
      treatment. The central randomization scheme will provide the site pharmacists with a unique&#xD;
      drug code corresponding to either study drugs or matching placebo. These will be kept in&#xD;
      identical, coded containers. Only the study center and site pharmacy will be aware of the&#xD;
      coding scheme. Masking will be carried out as follows: 1) Cyclosporine: study drug given as&#xD;
      per protocol for 2 weeks. A single SC injection is given on Day 1 of admission. With a second&#xD;
      injection given on day 4 of admission.; 2) Etanercept: Study drug given as per protocol.&#xD;
      Receive IV normal saline for 2 weeks to mimic the cyclosporine schedule. Subcutaneous&#xD;
      injection of etanercept given on study day 1 and study day 4; 3) Supportive therapy: A single&#xD;
      saline SC injection on Day 1 and Day 4 to mimic etanercept and normal saline for 14 days to&#xD;
      mimic the cyclosporine schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8.2 Study Visits or Study Assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also as listed in the research plan, facilities, and resources, and detailed laboratory&#xD;
      plan).&#xD;
&#xD;
      8.3 Unscheduled Visits (following discharge between 3 and 12-month follow-ups) Following&#xD;
      discharge, the patient will be discharged to the care of their clinical team that will&#xD;
      generally include follow-up with dermatology and ophthalmology at a minimum and if disease&#xD;
      activity increase or other concerns arise they will be asked to liaise with the clinical team&#xD;
      however study personnel should also be contacted and the participant may be asked to return&#xD;
      for an &quot;unscheduled&quot; visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9. Biospecimen Storage (see comprehensive laboratory plan) 10. Criteria for Participant and&#xD;
      Study Completion and Premature Study Termination&#xD;
&#xD;
      a. Participant Stopping Rules and Withdrawal Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may be prematurely terminated from the study for the following reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The participant elects to withdraw consent from all future study activities, including&#xD;
           follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The participant is &quot;lost to follow-up&quot; (i.e., no further follow-up is possible because&#xD;
           attempts to reestablish contact with the participant have failed). [use specific&#xD;
           criteria to define &quot;lost to follow-up&quot;]&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The participant dies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The participant is withdrawn from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Individual safety stopping rules as defined under the study drugs section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study stopping rules:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan two interim analyses to allow early stopping for efficacy. These analyses will take&#xD;
      place when we have acquired outcome measures for one-third and for two-thirds of the total&#xD;
      target sample. We will use the Haybittle-Peto rule applied to each of the three pairwise&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney comparisons of time to re-epithelialization between arms. As with the primary&#xD;
      analysis, patients who die prior to achieving re-epithelialization will be allocated the&#xD;
      maximum observed time to re-epithelialization plus one, so as to ensure that death is treated&#xD;
      as worse than any time to successful treatment. One arm will be declared inferior to another&#xD;
      if the p-value for the difference is less than 0.001. No adjustment will be made to the final&#xD;
      analysis for interim testing. If one arm is found to be inferior to another arm, the Data&#xD;
      Safety Monitoring Board will be instructed to strongly consider stopping recruitment to that&#xD;
      arm. If one arm is found to be inferior to both other arms, the Data Safety Monitoring Board&#xD;
      will be instructed to immediately stop recruitment in the inferior arm. If the other two arms&#xD;
      also differ with a p-value less than 0.001, the recruitment will be stopped in all arms. We&#xD;
      will have no formal stopping rules for safety outcomes different from time to&#xD;
      re-epithelialization, but the Data Monitoring Committee will be explicitly mandated to&#xD;
      carefully consider any safety signals with a view towards stopping recruitment if any&#xD;
      expected or unexpected safety signal emerges.&#xD;
&#xD;
      b. Participant Replacement If a participant withdraws or is withdrawn from the study, no&#xD;
      further data or samples will be collected. The participant will not be replaced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      c. Follow-up after Early Study Withdrawal Participants who withdraw from the study will be&#xD;
      taken out of the study and no further data or samples will be collected. Study drugs and&#xD;
      interventions will no longer continue after the patient is withdrawn from the study. Data and&#xD;
      samples collected during the time of participation in the study will still be kept for study&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
