  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single arm, multi-site phase Ib/II clinical trial of standard doses of High&#xD;
      Dose Interleukin-2 (HD IL2) (600,000 IU/kg/dose intravenously during two 5-day cycles 9 days&#xD;
      apart) in IL-2 eligible clear cell metastatic RCC (Renal Cell Carcinoma) subjects in&#xD;
      combination with Nivolumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators hypothesize that concurrent PD-1 inhibition synergistically enhances the&#xD;
      anti-tumor immune response to HD IL-2 in metastatic clear cell RCC. Investigators postulate&#xD;
      that the combination of the two therapies would result in an increase in the overall response&#xD;
      rate, complete response rate, and improved survival outcomes compared to either of the&#xD;
      individual therapies.&#xD;
