      Cohort A - neoadjuvant administration of IDH305 at 550 mg BID for 6 weeks followed by&#xD;
      surgical resection at 6 weeks. If there is no evidence of progressive disease at 6 weeks&#xD;
      (clinical, radiographic or histopathologic exam), the patient will continue on IDH305 at 550&#xD;
      mg BID post-operatively for a maximum of 11 additional 28 day cycles. Subsequent assessment&#xD;
      of disease will occur every 2 months starting in Cycle 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort B - patients who have inoperable tumors but measurable 2HG pre-treatment will be&#xD;
      treated with IDH305 at 550 mg BID x 6 weeks. If there is adequate sustained knockdown of 2HG&#xD;
      on MRS and disease is stable or improved, then the patient will continue on treatment for a&#xD;
      maximum of 11 additional 28 day cycles.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      IDH1 mutations are thought to be among the earliest mutations occurring during transformation&#xD;
      of glial cells into gliomas and dependence on the IDH-2HG pathway for survival and growth may&#xD;
      be most relevant during the indolent phase of low grade tumor growth. However, the&#xD;
      preclinical workup of IDH inhibitors was technically unable to assess low grade gliomas&#xD;
      because the cells do not grow in vitro and so cannot be cultured, and the cells have such a&#xD;
      low proliferation rate that they do not grow in mouse in vivo models. Despite this, Dr. Maher&#xD;
      and colleagues have studied low grade metabolism in low grade gliomas in vivo, in patients&#xD;
      undergoing surgical resection and infused with 13C-glucose or 13C-acetate. 13C-labeled tumor&#xD;
      can be studied by 13C-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) ex vivo. 13C-NMR data from IDH-mutated&#xD;
      low grade gliomas demonstrate that these tumors are highly metabolically active, capable of&#xD;
      oxidizing both glucose and acetate while these substrates also contribute carbon to actively&#xD;
      making 2HG (manuscript in preparation). These data strongly suggest that the low grade tumors&#xD;
      may be dependent on the IDH pathway for maintaining the altered metabolic state of the cell&#xD;
      and altered epigenome necessary for tumor growth. Treating low grade gliomas during the&#xD;
      period of indolent growth poses a challenge in terms of evaluating a molecular targeted&#xD;
      therapy for response and survival. Standard MRI assessment for low grade gliomas based on&#xD;
      T2/FLAIR signal can be difficult to quantitate and reflects additional non-specific changes&#xD;
      in the tumor microenvironment including edema and reactive gliosis. This is exacerbated by&#xD;
      the natural history of these tumors for which there may be no change in tumor size over&#xD;
      years. Added to this is the uncertainty that a drug was able to penetrate the blood brain&#xD;
      barrier, enter the tumor and inhibit the target. To date, there is no non-invasive way to&#xD;
      determine target inhibition, leaving the patients on a drug that may not inhibit the target&#xD;
      and the investigator unsure if data being obtained reflects true activity. The current&#xD;
      clinical trial addresses these challenges through a neoadjuvant clinical trial that combines&#xD;
      non-invasive evaluation of 2HG by MRS to assess target inhibition within 1 week of study&#xD;
      entry and direct tumor tissue analysis after 6 weeks on study in the surgical cohort. The&#xD;
      comprehensive planned tissue analysis is designed to assess the impact of IDH305 on metabolic&#xD;
      pathways, the epigenome and transcriptome, in addition to standard assessment of cellular&#xD;
      proliferation and cell kill. A second cohort of patients, the non-surgical cohort, will&#xD;
      include patients with a presumptive diagnosis of IDH-mutated glioma based on elevated 2HG on&#xD;
      screening 2HG MRS but without a surgical resection planned because of perceived high risk of&#xD;
      the procedure. It is anticipated that ~ 93% of these patients will have an IDH1 mutation and&#xD;
      thus treatment with the IDH1 selective inhibitor will knockdown 2HG. For patients with an&#xD;
      IDH2 mutation (~7-8%), we anticipate that there will be no change in 2HG. These patients will&#xD;
      come off study, sparing them any potential toxicity without potential benefit.&#xD;

                  taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive&#xD;
                  status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment Male&#xD;
                  sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). The vasectomized male&#xD;

                  forms of hormonal, for example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone&#xD;
                  contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  In case of use of oral contraception women should have been stable on the same&#xD;
                  pill for a minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  b. Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS). c.&#xD;
                  Barrier methods of contraception: condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or&#xD;
                  cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have&#xD;
             had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile&#xD;
             (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral&#xD;
             oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy), total hysterectomy or tubal ligation at&#xD;
             least six weeks ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive&#xD;
             status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she&#xD;
             considered not of child bearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Sexually active males must use a condom during intercourse while taking the drug and&#xD;
             for 30 days after stopping treatment and should not father a child in this period. A&#xD;
             condom is required to be used also by vasectomized men as well as during intercourse&#xD;
             with a male partner in order to prevent delivery of the drug via semen.&#xD;
