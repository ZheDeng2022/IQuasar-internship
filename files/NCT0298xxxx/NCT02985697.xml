    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intranasal dexmedetomidine&#xD;
      when used in combination with oral midazolam and/or nitrous oxide for moderate sedation&#xD;
      during pediatric outpatient dental procedures.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be organized as a prospective, randomized, double-blind trial in which&#xD;
      children who meet the study criteria are randomly separated into three test groups (IN DEX,&#xD;
      MIDDEX, and NOMIDDEX) and one control group (CTRL). Patients will be scheduled to complete&#xD;
      one quadrant of dental care per sedation. Dental procedures to be performed include composite&#xD;
      restorations, sealants, stainless steel crowns, pulp therapy, and extractions, with the exact&#xD;
      number and type dependant on each patient's individual treatment plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group IN DEX will receive a placebo dose of flavored water followed by 3 mcg/kg intranasal&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine in conjunction with 50/50 nitrous oxide/oxygen at a calculated flow rate. If&#xD;
      adequate sedation is not obtained within 60 minutes of drug administration, the sedation will&#xD;
      be considered a failure and the procedure will be terminated and rescheduled for completion&#xD;
      of care using deep sedation or general anesthesia, in keeping with normal office policy.&#xD;
      Second doses of intranasal dexmedetomidine or placebo will not be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group MIDDEX will receive 3 mcg/kg intranasal dexmedetomidine and 0.5 mg/kg oral midazolam&#xD;
      and 100% oxygen at a calculated flow rate (oxygen administration to function as placebo for&#xD;
      nitrous oxide). If adequate sedation is not obtained within 60 minutes of drug&#xD;
      administration, the sedation will be considered a failure and the procedure will be&#xD;
      terminated and rescheduled for completion of care using deep sedation or general anesthesia,&#xD;
      in keeping with normal office policy. Second doses of intranasal dexmedetomidine or oral&#xD;
      midazolam will not be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group NOMIDDEX will receive 3 mcg/kg intranasal dexmedetomidine, 0.5 mg/kg oral midazolam,&#xD;
      and 50/50 nitrous oxide/oxygen at a calculated flow rate. If adequate sedation is not&#xD;
      obtained within 60 minutes of drug administration, the sedation will be considered a failure&#xD;
      and the procedure will be terminated and rescheduled for completion of care using deep&#xD;
      sedation or general anesthesia, in keeping with normal office policy. Second doses of&#xD;
      intranasal dexmedetomidine or oral midazolam will not be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group, Group CTRL, will receive a placebo dose of normal saline and 0.5 mg/kg&#xD;
      oral midazolam and 50/50 nitrous oxide/oxygen at a calculated flow rate. Midazolam was chosen&#xD;
      as the control due to its well documented history of use in pediatric procedural sedations.&#xD;
      If adequate sedation is not obtained within 60 minutes of drug administration, the sedation&#xD;
      will be considered a failure and the procedure will be terminated and rescheduled for&#xD;
      completion of care using deep sedation or general anesthesia, in keeping with normal office&#xD;
      policy. Second doses of intranasal dexmedetomidine or oral midazolam will not be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial flow rate of nitrous oxide/oxygen will be calculated by multiplying the patient's&#xD;
      respiratory rate by their estimated tidal volume. Tidal volume is estimated at 10 ml/kg. The&#xD;
      flow rate will then adjusted to the patient's pulmonary needs. At the conclusion of the&#xD;
      procedure, all patients will be given 100% oxygen for at least 5 minutes and allowed to&#xD;
      recover to stable vital signs, level of consciousness, motor function, and adequate hydration&#xD;
      and pain control before discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All intranasal drugs and placebos will be administered using the MAD300 Nasal Drug Delivery&#xD;
      Device, manufactured by Wolfe Tory. Typical particle size delivered into the nare is 30-100&#xD;
      microns. The device is 1.65 inches in length, has a tip diameter of .17 inches, and an&#xD;
      internal dead space of 0.07 ml. Dexmedetomidine will be drawn from the manufacturer's vial&#xD;
      and administered non-diluted (200 mcg/ml). The medication will be administered nearly&#xD;
      immediately (less than 1 minute from withdrawal from original vial). A maximum of 1ml will be&#xD;
      administered per nare.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All nasal administration of drugs and placebos will occur approximately 30 minutes before&#xD;
      scheduled procedure start time and all orally administration of drugs and placebos will occur&#xD;
      approximately 15 minutes before scheduled procedure start time. Administration of all inhaled&#xD;
      agents and placebos will begin approximately 5 minutes prior to scheduled procedure start&#xD;
      time. This delay will allow for coincident onset of drug effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In accordance with Bon Secours policy and evidence based guidelines, vital signs of all&#xD;
      patients will be monitored by a Bon Secours nurse from the time of drug administration until&#xD;
      discharge. Pulse oximetry, heart rate, respiratory rate, and end tidal CO2 will be monitored&#xD;
      continuously. Blood pressure will be measured via an appropriately sized arm cuff every 5&#xD;
      minutes, beginning 5 minutes prior to first drug or placebo administration and ending when&#xD;
      the patient meets discharge criteria. The sedating dentist will be present in a supervisory&#xD;
      role for the duration of the sedation and remain immediately available until the patient is&#xD;
      discharged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In accordance with Bon Secours policy, all patients will be required to have a history and&#xD;
      physical completed by their primary care provider a maximum of 30 days prior to date of&#xD;
      procedure. Patients are also required to observe hospital pre-operative fasting guidelines&#xD;
      (NPO solids, milk, formula &gt; 6 hours, breast milk &gt; 4 hours, clear liquids &gt; 2 hours).&#xD;
      Topical and local anesthesia (2% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine) will be administered&#xD;
      prior to operative procedures to facilitate pain control. Patient caregivers will be given&#xD;
      appropriate post-operative instructions. Each patient will be followed up with a phone call&#xD;
      the evening of the procedure and the next day to inquire about any complications and whether&#xD;
      or not the child has returned to baseline activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age, weight, gender, ASA status, dosages of all drugs used, monitoring provider, procedural&#xD;
      times, adverse events, required interventions, and quality of sedation will be recorded.&#xD;
      Apnea, desaturation, airway obstruction, bradycardia, hypotension, fever, and inability to&#xD;
      complete the procedure will be considered minor adverse events. Major adverse events are&#xD;
      defined as death, aspiration, cardiac arrest, unplanned hospital admission, and level-of-care&#xD;
      increase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a patient has 3 consecutive blood pressure readings (taken at 5 minute intervals) that&#xD;
      fall below the 5th percentile for age, the hypotension protocol will be initiated. The&#xD;
      hypotension protocol consists of: (1) Placement of an IV. (2) Administration of 20 ml/kg of&#xD;
      IV normal saline every 5 minutes (maximum of 60 ml/kg over 15 minutes) (3) Concentration of&#xD;
      nitrous oxide will be reduced to 25%, if applicable and no additional sedative agents will be&#xD;
      administered (4) If blood pressure improves with intervention and the patient remains&#xD;
      adequately sedated, the scheduled dental procedures will be completed. (5) If intervention is&#xD;
      unsuccessful and blood pressure does not improve, the procedure will be terminated and the&#xD;
      patient will be transferred to the emergency room for level of care increase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event that a patient experiences rage, agitation, or paradoxical excitation, they will&#xD;
      be restrained using protective stabilization for their safety. Consent for protective&#xD;
      stabilization will be obtained when consent for sedation and study participation is obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient olfaction will be assessed preoperatively and postoperatively using standard&#xD;
      anesthesia olfactory oils when possible (based on pt age and developmental status). Nasal&#xD;
      mucosa will be examined preoperatively and postoperatively by the attending sedationist.&#xD;
      Abnormalities will be referred to the patient's primary care provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sedation quality and patient behavior will be evaluated using the University of Michigan&#xD;
      sedation scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be assessed by analyzing adverse events. Efficacy will be assessed by analyzing&#xD;
      the quality of sedation based on scoring from the University of Michigan Scale.&#xD;
