  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The presence of pain, reduced range of motion and decrease of muscle strength of the upper&#xD;
      limb in the early postoperative period are some of the major deficiencies of the breast&#xD;
      cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this study were to evaluate muscle strength, range of motion (ROM), pain,&#xD;
      perimetry of the upper limbs and applied questionnaires of the upper lim function and quality&#xD;
      of life, in patients after surgical treatment of breast cancer in different postoperative&#xD;
      periods and different groups following rehabilitation: traditional postoperatively exercise&#xD;
      to perform at home versus traditional exercises associated with weekly physiotherapy sessions&#xD;
      to strength training for shoulder movements.&#xD;

      A clinical trial, randomized, blinded study. The groups were divided according to the type of&#xD;
      rehabilitation (weekly sessions of Physiotherapy-F and Orientation -O). The surgical type&#xD;
      (M-Mastectomy and Q-Quadrantectomy) was also taken into account.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Were not included in the study those patients who underwent previous surgeries of breast&#xD;
      cancer, breast reconstruction, those with some neurological deficit or acute orthopedic&#xD;
      shoulder injury, such as tendonitis or bursitis, patients with previous histories of shoulder&#xD;
      fracture with limited range of motion and tumor stage T4b or N3 or patients with bone or&#xD;
      brain metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients underwent preoperative evaluation and guidance of general care; then returned&#xD;
      after one, two, three and six months postoperatively for reassessment and reorientation. The&#xD;
      physiotherapy group, in addition to receiving guidance, had, weekly, physical therapy&#xD;
      sessions with the goal to increase muscle strength in the upper limbs, between one and three&#xD;
      months after surgery.The exercises performed were active-free, with the aid of a stick or&#xD;
      resistance by elastic bands and dumbbells for flexion, extension, adduction, abduction,&#xD;
      external and internal rotation of the shoulder, and elbow flexion and extension, besides&#xD;
      activities to enable movements functional. The mode of execution of the exercises was&#xD;
      isotonic, done slowly and within the joint amplitude reached by the patient, using resistance&#xD;
      according to the muscular capacity of each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All evaluations were performed by the physiotherapy team; the professionals were not aware of&#xD;
      whether the patient belonged to the physiotherapy group or to the guidance group, constituted&#xD;
      by a single evaluator (blinded study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluations were: muscular strength of the shoulder, evaluated by means of a manual&#xD;
      isokinetic dynamometer, which records the peak of force, in kilograms, during five seconds of&#xD;
      muscle contraction duration; range of motion of the shoulder: measured by a goniometer;&#xD;
      function of the upper limb: ascertained by the application of a specific questionnaire, the&#xD;
      Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand Questionnaire (DASH) assesses functional capacity&#xD;
      in upper limb diseases and measures the abilities to perform certain activities; pain:&#xD;
      evaluated by the application of the Verbal Numerical Pain Scale (NVA); perimetry: evaluated&#xD;
      with a tape measure in eight distinct points in the upper limbs and quality of life, analyzed&#xD;
      by a European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life C30&#xD;
      (QLQ-C30) questionnaire with a Specific module for breast cancer (BR) 23 - Breast Specific&#xD;
      Module.&#xD;
