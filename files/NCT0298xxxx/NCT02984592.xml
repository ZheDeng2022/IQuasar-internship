  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Premature ejaculation (PE) is one of the prevalent disorders in men; its leading sequel such&#xD;
      as lack of self-confidence, anxiety, depression and unsatisfactory intercourse in men and&#xD;
      their partners. The current study was aimed to evaluate the relationship between ejaculation&#xD;
      and physical activity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Premature ejaculation (PE) is the most frequent sexual dysfunction in males, and its&#xD;
      prevalence has been reported as 21-33%. Currently, there are no universal criteria for the&#xD;
      diagnosis, or treatment strategies or approaches for PE. Lack of observational studies&#xD;
      directed to PE makes comprehension of this sexual dysfunction difficult. The common point for&#xD;
      definition of PE is a short duration between penetration and ejaculation, little or no&#xD;
      control on voluntary control of ejaculation, and annoying character and negative effect of&#xD;
      this condition on the individual. There are various treatment methods since ejaculation&#xD;
      physiology and neuroanatomy is not yet clearly demonstrated. According to neurobiological&#xD;
      hypothesis of Waldinger, a dysfunction in the serotonin pathway of the central system such as&#xD;
      serotonin-2C hyposensitivity and/or serotonin-1A receptor hypersensitivity is a possible&#xD;
      cause of lifelong PE. These experimental animal models showed that serotonergic activity at&#xD;
      hypothalamic level inhibited ejaculation reflex. Based on this physiological effect,&#xD;
      selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), and serotonin agonists increase intravaginal&#xD;
      ejaculation latency time (IELT). A number of studies showed that exercise increased the&#xD;
      functional effect of serotonin in the human brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effects of physical activity level on human health have attracted interest worldwide.&#xD;
      Lack of physical activity forms the basis of various health problems, however regular&#xD;
      physical act contributes prevention and treatment of a number of disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In current study, investigators will compare the ejaculation control, IELT, and prevalence of&#xD;
      PE between sportsmen that have regular physical activity, and the individuals with a&#xD;
      sedentary lifestyle.&#xD;
