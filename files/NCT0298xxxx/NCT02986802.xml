  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preterm delivery (PTD), together with low birthweight (LBW), is the leading cause of infant&#xD;
      death and illness, affecting 500,000 births with annual medical costs of more than $26&#xD;
      billion in the U.S. each year. Identifying changeable risk factors to reduce PTD is&#xD;
      considered a top research priority. Recent research has shown genital herpes infection (HSV)&#xD;
      is associated with increased risks of PTD and LBW. More importantly, treating this infection,&#xD;
      including infection with no symptoms, using readily available antiviral medications can be&#xD;
      effective in removing the risk due to HSV. Thus, early identification and treatment of HSV in&#xD;
      pregnant women could be an effective way to prevent PTD and LBW. Currently, many pregnant&#xD;
      women with HSV infection, especially those with no symptoms, choose not to treat due to (a) a&#xD;
      lack of demonstrated benefit of treatment and (b) general hesitance to use medications during&#xD;
      pregnancy due to safety concerns for the fetus. Thus, emerging evidence of an increased risk&#xD;
      of PTD/LBW associated with HSV infection, if untreated, and treatment effectiveness by&#xD;
      anti-herpes medications has significantly changed current treatment paradigms among pregnant&#xD;
      women. This evidence also provides new hope that effectively treating HSV infection among&#xD;
      pregnant women, especially before the 3rd trimester, could lead to a new method to reduce PTD&#xD;
      and LBW and reduce racial/ethnic disparities in these risks due to high rates of the&#xD;
      infection in minority groups. To further examine the effectiveness of treating HSV in&#xD;
      pregnant women to reduce adverse pregnancy outcomes, the investigators propose to conduct a&#xD;
      prospective cohort study with a two-stage design combining the large pregnant women&#xD;
      population (N=90,000) in Stage I identified through Kaiser Permanente Northern California&#xD;
      (KPNC) electronic medical records (EMRs), with a Stage II sample to collect detailed&#xD;
      information on additional factors that might muddle our understanding of this issue. This&#xD;
      study will address the following: (1) Does treating HSV infection in pregnant women reduce&#xD;
      the risk of PTD or LBW? (2) Does timing of the treatment during pregnancy influence treatment&#xD;
      effectiveness? (3) Do other factors influence treatment effectiveness? and (4) Does HSV&#xD;
      infection in pregnancy, if untreated, increase the risk of PTD and LBW, compared to no&#xD;
      infection? Answers to these questions will be valuable to pregnant women and clinicians, and&#xD;
      directly address their concerns when making treatment decisions&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preterm delivery (PTD), along with low birthweight (LBW), is the leading cause of perinatal&#xD;
      mortality and morbidity. In the U.S., 12% of livebirths are PTDs, resulting in more than $26&#xD;
      billion in medical costs annually. The impact on infant health and staggering costs makes PTD&#xD;
      one of the top research priorities of PCORI, AHRQ, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) and the&#xD;
      World Health Organization (WHO), due to a lack of effective interventions to reduce PTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genital herpes infection is prevalent, with a recent WHO estimation of 500 million people&#xD;
      worldwide infected. Treating pregnant women with genital herpes infection, especially before&#xD;
      the 3rd trimester, has been shown to reduce the risk of PTD and LBW, thus it can be an&#xD;
      effective intervention to reduce PTD/LBW. However, the effectiveness and benefit of treating&#xD;
      genital herpes to reduce PTD and LBW needs to be further demonstrated in order to be&#xD;
      incorporated into the treatment decision making process. Currently, many pregnant women&#xD;
      choose not to treat genital herpes due to a general aversion to taking medications during&#xD;
      pregnancy for the safety of their fetuses, and a lack of demonstrated evidence of benefits.&#xD;
      Paradoxically, the choice of no treatment for genital herpes may adversely impact fetal&#xD;
      health, leading to PTD and LBW. Given that pregnant women frequently prefer no treatment,&#xD;
      studies are urgently needed to establish the risk-benefit profile between treatment and no&#xD;
      treatment for genital herpes infection in the context of improving fetal health, including&#xD;
      the timing of treatment (before the 3rd trimester). This study is designed to provide clear&#xD;
      evidence of treatment effectiveness in real-world clinical practice, and risk-benefit&#xD;
      profiles to inform both treatment decisions by pregnant women and clinicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposed comparative effectiveness study will address the following questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Does treating genital herpes infection in pregnant women reduce the risk of adverse&#xD;
           pregnancy outcomes including PTD or LBW? (treated vs. untreated)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Does the timing of the treatment during pregnancy influence the treatment effectiveness&#xD;
           on reducing adverse pregnancy outcomes (PTD and LBW)? (head-to-head comparison of&#xD;
           treatment timing: before the 3rd trimester vs. during the 3rd trimester).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Do other treatment metrics, including treatment duration, dosage, and compliance, impact&#xD;
           treatment effectiveness in reducing the risk of PTD and LBW?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Does treatment effectiveness vary depending on the type (or severity) of underlying&#xD;
           genital herpes infection? (e.g., treating symptomatic genital herpes infection vs.&#xD;
           treating latent/asymptomatic genital herpes)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Does genital herpes infection in pregnancy, if untreated, increase the risk of PTD and&#xD;
           LBW, compared to no genital herpes infection? (untreated vs. controls without genital&#xD;
           herpes) In addition, this study is especially relevant in addressing racial disparities,&#xD;
           given that minority pregnant women have higher rates of both genital herpes infection&#xD;
           and PTD: 3 times the infection rate and 150% higher PTD rate among African-Americans&#xD;
           compared to Whites. Thus, demonstrating the effectiveness of treating genital herpes in&#xD;
           reducing PTD could lead to a reduction in the existing racial disparity in PTD rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Description Overall study design: The investigators will conduct a prospective cohort&#xD;
      study with a two-stage design based on more than 90,000 pregnant KPNC members in real-world&#xD;
      clinical practice. Due to the increased fetal risk of untreated genital herpes infection,&#xD;
      randomizing pregnant women with the infection into treated and untreated groups presents&#xD;
      ethical problems, thus is not feasible. Our innovative two-stage prospective cohort design,&#xD;
      leveraging our large membership and comprehensive electronic medical record (EMR) data, is a&#xD;
      robust alternative option for examining the comparative effectiveness of treating genital&#xD;
      herpes infection in pregnant women to reduce PTD and LBW.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparators: Three comparisons will be made:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. When assessing treatment effectiveness, women with the infection who choose not to&#xD;
           receive treatment will serve as the comparator (untreated). This comparator is a&#xD;
           frequently preferred treatment option chosen by pregnant women due to their reluctance&#xD;
           to use medications during pregnancy, based on their predominant concerns for the safety&#xD;
           of their developing fetus as well as a lack of evidence that treating genital herpes&#xD;
           infection is beneficial to their fetus. This comparator will also make the comparison&#xD;
           groups more comparable by controlling for confounding by indication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. When assessing the timing of treatment effectiveness (before vs. after the start of the&#xD;
           3rd trimester), those who receive treatment during the 3rd trimester will be used as the&#xD;
           comparator. Using this comparator will allow a head-to-head comparison between the&#xD;
           timing of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. When assessing the effect of choosing not to treat during pregnancy, women without an&#xD;
           underlying genital herpes infection or receipt of any treatment will serve as the&#xD;
           comparator (normal controls). This comparison will provide evidence of the increased&#xD;
           risk of PTD and LBW if genital herpes infection is not treated during pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our comparators will allow us to control for confounding by indication (genital herpes, its&#xD;
      type and severity). Our EMR contains extensive questions on risk factors, including lifestyle&#xD;
      factors, for all 90,000 mother-infant dyads. Through the unique two-stage study design,&#xD;
      investigators will collect additional information, through interviews, on a subsample of&#xD;
      women that will further allow controlling for additional confounders. Multiple statistical&#xD;
      methodologies, in accordance with PCORI's methodology standards, will be employed in the&#xD;
      analytic plan (e.g., propensity scores, instrumental variable methods) to ensure&#xD;
      compatibility between comparison groups.&#xD;
