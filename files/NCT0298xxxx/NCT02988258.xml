  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will test the hypothesis that CMV TCR-transduced T cells, at a specific T-cell&#xD;
      dose/kg, can generate a functional CMV immune response post-transplant, where CMV-specific&#xD;
      donor T cells cannot be isolated by conventional means. This will be tested in the context of&#xD;
      adult HLA-matched sibling allogeneic HSCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the proposed trial, an HLA-A*0201-restricted CMV pp65-specific T cell receptor (TCR) will&#xD;
      be introduced into donor T cells via ex vivo GMP retroviral transduction. Donor T cells will&#xD;
      be isolated from peripheral blood following a simple venesection procedure. The CMV&#xD;
      TCR-transduced T cells will be tested for TCR expression, CMV-specific cytokine secretion and&#xD;
      microbiological contamination before being frozen and stored at -80C. CMV seropositive&#xD;
      transplant recipients will be tested weekly for CMV reactivation by quantitative PCR on&#xD;
      peripheral blood. On first detection of CMV DNA &gt; 200 copies/ml, 104 (cohort 1) or 105&#xD;
      (cohort 2) bulk CMV TCR-transduced T cells/kg recipient weight will be infused into the&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood will be taken regularly to determine persistence and expansion of the CMV&#xD;
      TCR-transduced T cells. Weekly CMV PCR will be continued. Patients will be examined at&#xD;
      appropriate intervals (daily if inpatients, twice weekly in BMT clinic if outpatients) for&#xD;
      the development of graft versus host disease (GVHD) or other potential side effects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Reactivation of the latent human herpes virus, Cytomegalovirus (CMV), post allogeneic&#xD;
      haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (Allo-HSCT) can result in significant morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality unless treated promptly. Anti-viral therapy is usually effective, but has serious&#xD;
      side effects typically requiring prolonged inpatient admission, such as myelosuppression&#xD;
      (Ganciclovir) or nephrotoxicity (Foscarnet). Cellular immunotherapy for CMV has been tested&#xD;
      in Phase I/II trials in the UK and Europe. In these trials CMV-specific T cells were isolated&#xD;
      from the peripheral blood of CMV seropositive donors and re-infused into recipients following&#xD;
      CMV reactivation resulting in sustained anti-viral responses. It is clear that&#xD;
      post-transplant recovery of CD8+ CMV-specific cytotoxic T-cells (CTL) abrogates the&#xD;
      development of CMV-related disease. An advantage of cellular therapy for CMV reactivation is&#xD;
      the transfer of immunological memory, which can reduce the number of subsequent&#xD;
      reactivations. This is important, as rapidly increasing numbers of highly immunosuppressive&#xD;
      (or T cell depleted) reduced intensity conditioning Allo-HSCTs are being performed in the UK.&#xD;
      These approaches reduce the toxicity of transplantation in older patients with more&#xD;
      co-morbidities. Reduced intensity allogeneic transplants are currently part of the UK MRC&#xD;
      AML15 trial and are to be recommended in the proposed MRC/ECOG UKALL14 study and again in UK&#xD;
      MRC AML17. In addition, a number of NCRN approved UK multicentre extended Phase II studies&#xD;
      have recently started using reduced intensity Allo-HSCT in various lymphoma subtypes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transplant recipients with CMV seronegative donors cannot benefit from currently available&#xD;
      cellular immunotherapy approaches due to the lack of CMV-specific memory T cells in these&#xD;
      donors. At present, there is no reliable strategy to isolate virus specific T cells from&#xD;
      uninfected na√Øve individuals, as the precursor frequency is low or absent and the in vitro&#xD;
      priming of T-cell responses is inefficient. T-cell receptor (TCR) gene transfer offers a&#xD;
      strategy to produce antigen-specific T cells independent of precursor frequency and without&#xD;
      the need for T-cell priming. As approximately 50% of adult individuals have been previously&#xD;
      infected with CMV, there are significant numbers of CMV 'mismatched' Allo-HSCT performed,&#xD;
      where the donor is CMV seronegative and the recipient CMV seropositive. The proposed study&#xD;
      will test the feasibility of generating donor-derived CMV-specific T cells via the ex vivo&#xD;
      introduction of a CMV-specific T cell receptor using a GMP grade retroviral vector.&#xD;
