      To evaluate coblation channeling treatment for chronic tonsillitis. Does Tonsillar ablation&#xD;
      can create changing in the tonsillar medium for recurrent tonsillar infections and stop the&#xD;
      recurrent infections?&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The palatine tonsil consists of an epithelial crypt (invaginated pocket) surrounded by dense&#xD;
      clusters of lymph nodules, each with a germinal center where lymphocytes proliferate. The&#xD;
      nodules are embedded in a mass of diffuse lymphoid tissue that consists of lymphocytes&#xD;
      migrating to and from the germinal centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increasing the surface area of the crypts is one way to facilitate the contact of antigens&#xD;
      (bacteria) with the immune cells. The epithelium may specialize to form an openmeshwork of&#xD;
      cells which allows the infiltration of the epithelium by lymphocytes and macrophages.&#xD;
      Tonsillar lymphoid nodules consist mainly of B-lymphocytes. Other areas are occupied by&#xD;
      T-lymphocytes, activated B-lymphocytes and other cells of the immune system. Inside the&#xD;
      crypts, where cells of the immune system often invade the epithelium, it will be difficult to&#xD;
      find the specific boundary between epithelium and lymphoid tissue. The bacterial material and&#xD;
      biofilms1 sits in crypts and may start a new infection from time to time. The epithelium&#xD;
      lining the crypt corresponds with that on the adjacent surface - stratified squamous in the&#xD;
      tongue and palate or pseudo stratified columnar in the pharynx. In either case, the&#xD;
      epithelium may be heavily infiltrated with lymphocytes, and the crypt may be filled with&#xD;
      lymphocytes and other debris.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tonsillar crypts have an important role in chronic tonsillitis. They are covered by&#xD;
      stratified epithelium and may be initiated via the epithelium to mount immune responses to&#xD;
      various presenting antigens. Go M. et al, investigated the expression and function of tight&#xD;
      junctions in the epithelium of human palatine tonsils from patients with tonsillar&#xD;
      hypertrophy or recurrent tonsillitis. These studies suggested unique expression of tight&#xD;
      junctions in human palatine tonsillar epithelium, and it was suggested that the crypt&#xD;
      epithelium may possess an epithelial barrier different from that of the surface epithelium2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bacteria within biofilms are resistant to host defenses and antibiotics. The presence of&#xD;
      bacterial biofilms within the tissue and crypts of inflamed tonsils may explain the chronic&#xD;
      and recurrent characteristics of some forms of tonsillitis. There is strong anatomical&#xD;
      evidence for the presence of bacterial biofilms in chronically diseased tonsils1. Using a&#xD;
      novel visualization approach in single sections of human mucosal tissue, the presence of&#xD;
      biofilms was demonstrated on tonsils in most (17/24 [70.8%]) patients with tonsillitis3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One study investigated the difference in follicle size and numbers in tonsils for patients&#xD;
      with tonsillar hypertrophy and recurrent tonsillitis using an image analysis method. There&#xD;
      was no significant difference in the mean follicle numbers per counting field between&#xD;
      recurrent tonsillitis and tonsillar hypertrophy. However, they demonstrated that tonsillar&#xD;
      hypertrophy is characterized histologically by an enlargement of follicles compared with&#xD;
      recurrent tonsillitis, indicating a hyperplastic condition of lymphoid cells in the germinal&#xD;
      centers. It may also explain the difference in etiology and immune mechanism between&#xD;
      tonsillar hypertrophy and recurrent tonsillitis4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coblation is a non-heat driven process in which radiofrequency energy is applied to a&#xD;
      conductive medium (usually saline) causing a highly focused plasma field to form around the&#xD;
      electrodes. The plasma field is comprised of highly ionized particles. These ionized&#xD;
      particles have sufficient energy to break organic molecular bonds within tissue. Instead of&#xD;
      exploding tissue, coblation causes a low-temperature molecular disintegration, resulting in&#xD;
      minimal tissue damage to surrounding areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A novel treatment for chronic tonsillitis is now suggested by the inventors, this method&#xD;
      being based on treating the source of recurrent bacterial infections in the tonsillar tissue,&#xD;
      specifically the tonsillar crypts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By treatment of the crypts and tonsillar tissue it may be possible to decrease the possible&#xD;
      antigen-immune system interaction and inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Without being bound to a specific theory, it is suggested that the combination of the radio&#xD;
      frequency energy and the fluid creates a &quot;plasma&quot; field containing highly ionized particles,&#xD;
      which have sufficient energy to break organic molecular bonds that can remove tissue&#xD;
      selectively without excessive heat production and damage the surrounding tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study protocol was approved by the The Hillel Yaffe Medical Center's Ethics and Helsinki&#xD;
      Committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      60 patients suffering from chronic tonsillitis will be treated by Coblation channeling to the&#xD;
      tonsils.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment was conducted using an Arthrocare® Corporation (ArthroCare Corporation, 7500&#xD;
      Rialto Boulevard Austin, Texas 78735) COBLATION electrode ReFlex Ultra 55* for tonsillar&#xD;
      tissue ablation at low temperatures with only one treatment. All the patients underwent&#xD;
      tonsil channeling treatment with coblation, and 4-6 channels were done in each tonsil under&#xD;
      local anesthesia, in the operating room. The patients were observed overnight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A control group included 60 patients with chronic tonsillitis with indication for&#xD;
      tonsillectomy will underwent tonsillectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients selected are older than 18 years old, and were healthy, without any chronic&#xD;
      diseases other than chronic tonsillitis. Diagnosis of chronic tonsillitis was based on&#xD;
      history and medical examination. The criteria were: 1. At least 4 occasions of tonsillitis in&#xD;
      the last year that were treated (positive throat swab for Streptococci Group A will&#xD;
      contribute towards the diagnosis). 2. Recurrent or chronic throat pain. 3. Hypertrophic&#xD;
      tonsils of chronic tonsillitis. Patients that were not included: 1. Disease of the mouth or&#xD;
      pharyngeal mucosa-like ulcers. 2. Allergy to drugs. 3. Gastrointestinal reflux. 4. Any&#xD;
      contraindication for tonsillectomy. 5. Peritonsillar abscess in the past.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Final evaluations were by follow-up of the patients 1,2,4,6 and 12 months after the beginning&#xD;
      of treatment. At each visit, evaluation of the treatment was done by investigating the degree&#xD;
      of throat pain or tonsillitis after the treatment, number of tonsillitis per year,&#xD;
      examination of the tonsils, post treatment pain score by VISUAL-ANALOG-SCALE (VAS) SCORES.&#xD;
      The following parameters were recorded: the size of tonsils before and after treatment,&#xD;
      number of occurrences of tonsillitis after one year, and if there was any post-treatment&#xD;
      bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results will be statistically evaluated .&#xD;
