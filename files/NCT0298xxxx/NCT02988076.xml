  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled study to evaluate&#xD;
      the effectiveness of Psychiatric Electroencephalogram Registry (PEER) Interactive to inform&#xD;
      medication prescription in subjects with a primary diagnosis of depression with comorbidity&#xD;
      of non-psychotic behavioral disorders versus treatment as usual, as determined by the&#xD;
      investigator. The primary measurement for improvement of the subjects depression will be a&#xD;
      self-evaluation questionnaire, the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report&#xD;
      16 , but the investigators will also collect information on their clinical global improvement&#xD;
      and any reduction in adverse events.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is prospective in nature. Subjects in the control group will be treated according&#xD;
      to treatment as usual and best judgment of the treating physician. For the experimental group&#xD;
      the treating physician will follow the guidance of the subject's PEER Interactive Report as&#xD;
      regards sensitivity to on-label medications and classes of medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will be washed out of all current medications prior to having an&#xD;
      electroencephalogram (EEG), which is necessary to generate the PEER Interactive Report. The&#xD;
      wash out period for outpatients is no longer than 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will be followed for 3 months after the initial treatment. The patient will be&#xD;
      seen on a routine basis and assessments will be made at each interaction to evaluate the&#xD;
      patient's improvement in mental health. The subjects will also be closely evaluated to&#xD;
      determine if they are experiencing any psychiatric specific adverse events. The investigator&#xD;
      is allowed to treat the patient according to their best medical judgment, which may include&#xD;
      adding or changing medications, seeing the patient more frequently, or other interventions&#xD;
      such as the use of sleep aids.&#xD;
