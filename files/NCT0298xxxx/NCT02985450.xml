    <textblock>
      (1) Due to missed childhood vaccination programs, the majority of adult patients with NAFLD&#xD;
      in Canada do not have immunity to hepatitis B. (2) Adults with NAFLD who receive the HBV&#xD;
      vaccine have reduced immunogenic responses in the setting of obesity (i.e., protective&#xD;
      anti-HBs titres). Aims: (1) To determine the sero-prevalence of immunity against hepatitis B&#xD;
      in a cohort of prospectively evaluated adult NAFLD patients. (2) To prospectively determine&#xD;
      HBV vaccine responses (anti-HBs titres) in adult NAFLD patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The hepatitis B virus (HBV) is truly a global human pathogen that affects at least 2 billion&#xD;
      people worldwide including ~240 million chronic hepatitis B (CHB) carriers that are at risk&#xD;
      for end-stage liver disease. The diagnosis of CHB is confirmed by the persistence of the HBV&#xD;
      surface antigen (HBsAg) in serum for &gt;6 months. However, a latent form of HBV infection known&#xD;
      as occult hepatitis B infection (OBI) characterized by low-level viremia (i.e., HBV DNA &lt; 200&#xD;
      IU/ml) despite undetectable serum HBsAg has been described with unclear clinical&#xD;
      consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A safe and effective HBV vaccine has been available for ~3 decades and consists of&#xD;
      recombinant HBsAg which contains the major viral antigenic epitopes and induces a protective&#xD;
      neutralizing antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs) response in &gt;85% of children vaccinated. Canada is&#xD;
      a low HBV-endemic region and in Alberta, and Ontario, public health uses maternal screening&#xD;
      for HBsAg to identify babies at-risk for CHB. Thus, all infants born to HBsAg (+) mothers are&#xD;
      given passive-active immunoprophylaxis with hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) and the HBV&#xD;
      vaccine within 12 hours of birth, as well as 2 doses at ~2 and ~6 months of age. Testing of&#xD;
      the infants for anti-HBs is recommended at 9 months to ensure immunity. In the late 1990's, a&#xD;
      universal HBV childhood vaccination program was initiated in all Canadian provinces and&#xD;
      jurisdictions. In Alberta and in Ontario, school-age children are scheduled to receive the&#xD;
      3-dose HBV vaccine series in grade 5. However there remain a significant proportion of adult&#xD;
      Canadians (i.e., born before 1985) who missed childhood vaccination programs. Although&#xD;
      current guidelines recommend that certain high-risk populations receive hepatitis B&#xD;
      immunization, appropriate identification and compliance is generally much lower in adults&#xD;
      compared to children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the most recent Canadian Association for the Study of Liver Disease guidelines,&#xD;
      all adults with diabetes, as well as all patients with chronic liver disease should receive&#xD;
      the hepatitis B vaccine. The basis for these recommendations are two-fold, (1) diabetics may&#xD;
      be at risk of blood-borne virus (BBV) exposure through contact with contaminated blood&#xD;
      glucose monitoring devices and (2) diabetic patients are at increased risk of the metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome and the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The improvement in&#xD;
      blood glucose monitoring devices, and increased knowledge has reduced the risk of HBV&#xD;
      exposure in patients with diabetes. Further, the investigators' initial seroepidemiological&#xD;
      survey of acute HBV outbreaks in Alberta revealed a decreasing prevalence in diabetic&#xD;
      patients. Therefore the main incentive for HBV vaccination in diabetics is due to the&#xD;
      concomitant risk of the metabolic syndrome and advanced liver disease due to NAFLD. There is&#xD;
      limited data on HBV vaccination in NAFLD patients. Further studies are required in a North&#xD;
      American adult (Canadian population).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose that adults with NAFLD should undergo comprehensive screening for&#xD;
      hepatitis B immunogenicity, in addition to screening for infection, and catch up or booster&#xD;
      vaccinations should be administered to non-immunized patients with confirmatory immunity&#xD;
      testing thereafter.&#xD;

    <description>to determine how NAFLD-associated metabolic risk factors and liver inflammation / fibrosis affects vaccine response. Fresh (or cryopreserved in 4 patients) PBMC (~106) were labeled with 1 μM carboxyfluorescein-diacetate-succinimidyl-ester. Labeled PBMC were stimulated with 5 μg HBsAg) in RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS and 2mmol/L glutamine. Anti-CD3 (1 μg/mL) and anti-CD28 (5 μg/mL) stimulated cells served as a positive control.&#xD;
Unstimulated DMSO-treated cells were used as negative controls. Cells were cultured in triplicates and plates incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for ~8 days. Cell proliferation was assessed on day 8. SI was calculated as % CFSE low cells in stimulated cells / % CFSE low cells in the unstimulated control46. SI&gt; 3 was considered positive for HBsAg-specific proliferation. Cells were stained using the memory T-cell panel and analyzed by flow-cytometry</description>

        <description>to determine how NAFLD-associated metabolic risk factors and liver inflammation / fibrosis affects vaccine response. Fresh (or cryopreserved in 4 patients) PBMC (~106) were labeled with 1 μM carboxyfluorescein-diacetate-succinimidyl-ester. Labeled PBMC were stimulated with 5 μg HBsAg) in RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS and 2mmol/L glutamine. Anti-CD3 (1 μg/mL) and anti-CD28 (5 μg/mL) stimulated cells served as a positive control.&#xD;
Unstimulated DMSO-treated cells were used as negative controls. Cells were cultured in triplicates and plates incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for ~8 days. Cell proliferation was assessed on day 8. SI was calculated as % CFSE low cells in stimulated cells / % CFSE low cells in the unstimulated control46. SI&gt; 3 was considered positive for HBsAg-specific proliferation. Cells were stained using the memory T-cell panel and analyzed by flow-cytometry</description>
