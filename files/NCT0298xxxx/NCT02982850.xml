      The prevalence of AF, which is tachyarrhythmia, is approximately 2% of the entire population&#xD;
      and 5% of the population at the age of 60 or older. AF is the cause of approximately 20% of&#xD;
      all events of ischemic stroke, and patients with AF are known to be at 6 to 10% risk of&#xD;
      ischemic stroke per year. Patients with valvular AF are known to have a higher incidence of&#xD;
      stroke than patients with nonvalvular AF. However, the relevant data are insufficient as&#xD;
      large randomized studies comparing NOAC treatment with warfarin, a conventional treatment,&#xD;
      did not include many patients with moderate and severe valvular AF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ischemic stroke is divided into symptomatic stroke with brain lesions on brain magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI) and silent cerebral infarct with lesions on brain MRI but without&#xD;
      stroke symptoms. According to a brain MRI follow-up study, the incidence of silent cerebral&#xD;
      infarct was 17.7% (254 subjects) over a period of 5 years, with 11.4% of 254 subjects&#xD;
      reporting to have experienced symptoms. This means that the incidence of silent cerebral&#xD;
      infarct is approximately 9 times that of symptomatic stroke. In addition, patients with a&#xD;
      history of silent cerebral infarct are known to be approximately twice more likely to&#xD;
      experience stroke in the future than those without a history of silent. Brain microbleed is&#xD;
      easily detected by brain MRI and is a well-known independent predictor of intraparenchymal&#xD;
      hemorrhage and silent cerebral infarct. The prevention of stroke by the study drug can be&#xD;
      indirectly assessed based on the incidence of silent cerebral infarct and brain microbleed on&#xD;
      brain MRI. Investigators tried to compare effect of dabigatran with conventional treatment in&#xD;
      terms of prevention of stroke by comparing incidences of silent cerebral infarct and brain&#xD;
      microbleed and symptomatic stroke using brain MRI.&#xD;

      Amongst different types of cardiac arrhythmia, tachyarrhythmia shows the highest prevalence.&#xD;
      The prevalence of AF, which is tachyarrhythmia, is approximately 2% of the entire population&#xD;
      and 5% of the population at the age of 60 or older. AF is the cause of approximately 20% of&#xD;
      all events of ischemic stroke, and patients with AF are known to be at 6 to 10% risk of&#xD;
      ischemic stroke per year. In addition, AF results in heart failure and doubles mortalities.&#xD;
      With an increase in the elderly population, there is a worldwide trend of increased&#xD;
      hospitalization rate and medical cost caused by cardiac arrhythmia. In addition, whereas AF&#xD;
      has been known to occur mainly in the elderly, the incidence of AF is also increasing in&#xD;
      younger population, which is thought to be associated with the increased prevalence of heart&#xD;
      diseases, dietary changes, and increased environmental pollution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Previous studies related to atrial fibrillation and stroke i. While AF is characterized by&#xD;
      a single electrophysiological abnormality, depending on cases, the risk of stroke varies from&#xD;
      below 1%/year to 20%/year or above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii. New oral anticoagulant (NOAC), left atrial appendage occlusion, etc. have been studied as&#xD;
      treatments to replace warfarin and aspirin and their effects have been also demonstrated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Relevant study trends and limitations i. Patients with valvular AF are known to have a&#xD;
      higher incidence of stroke than patients with nonvalvular AF. However, the relevant data are&#xD;
      insufficient as large randomized studies comparing NOAC treatment with warfarin, a&#xD;
      conventional treatment, did not include many patients with moderate and severe valvular AF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii. The exclusion of valvular AF from the study is based on the assumption that the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of thromboembolism would vary according to the type of AF. However, the&#xD;
      difference in pathogenesis of thromboembolism between valvular AF and nonvalvular AF remains&#xD;
      unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Study features i. Ischemic stroke is divided into symptomatic stroke with brain lesions on&#xD;
      brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and silent cerebral infarct with lesions on brain MRI&#xD;
      but without stroke symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii. According to a brain MRI follow-up study, the incidence of silent cerebral infarct was&#xD;
      17.7% (254 subjects) over a period of 5 years, with 11.4% of 254 subjects reporting to have&#xD;
      experienced symptoms. This means that the incidence of silent cerebral infarct is&#xD;
      approximately 9 times that of symptomatic stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii. In addition, patients with a history of silent cerebral infarct are known to be&#xD;
      approximately twice more likely to experience stroke in the future than those without a&#xD;
      history of silent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iv. Brain microbleed is easily detected by brain MRI and is a well-known independent&#xD;
      predictor of intraparenchymal hemorrhage and silent cerebral infarct.&#xD;
&#xD;
      v. The prevention of stroke by the study drug can be indirectly assessed based on the&#xD;
      incidence of silent cerebral infarct and brain microbleed on brain MRI at the start of study&#xD;
      and at 1 year follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D. Significance of the study i. The incidence of stroke is higher in valvular AF than in&#xD;
      nonvalvular AF. ii. There is lack of data on dabigatran treatment, an NOAC, in valvular AF.&#xD;
      iii. To compare dabigatran with conventional treatment in terms of prevention of stroke by&#xD;
      comparing incidences of silent cerebral infarct and brain microbleed and symptomatic stroke&#xD;
      at the start of study and at 1 year follow-up using brain MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single center, prospective, randomized study to evaluate the effectiveness and&#xD;
      safety of dabigatran versus conventional treatment in patients with valvular AF by comparing&#xD;
      the incidence of silent cerebral infarct and brain microbleed using brain MRI. Aspirin or&#xD;
      warfarin treatment will be continued in patients randomly allocated to conventional treatment&#xD;
      group, and changed to dabigatran treatment in those randomly allocated to dabigatran group.&#xD;
