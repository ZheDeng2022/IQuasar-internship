  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medical scientists have found that people with diabetes who take the drug Metformin have less&#xD;
      age-related disease than those taking other treatments and researchers believe it may prevent&#xD;
      numerous diseases and conditions that effect older people. In addition, metformin extends&#xD;
      lifespan in some animal models of human disease. The purpose of this study is to see if&#xD;
      taking Metformin causes changes in blood cells consistent with improved health and longevity&#xD;
      in people who do not have diabetes. In this study Metformin will be compared to placebo. A&#xD;
      placebo is a substance, like a sugar pill, that is not thought to have any effect on a&#xD;
      participants disease or condition. In this study participants will either receive the active&#xD;
      study medication, Metformin or placebo which is not active. Placebos are used in research&#xD;
      studies to see if the drug being studied really does have an effect.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The number of older adults is projected to increase dramatically by 2050. Aging-related&#xD;
      diseases and conditions still seriously compromise the quality of life among most older&#xD;
      adults. Several pharmaceutical agents, such as metformin, have been tested to extend lifespan&#xD;
      and delay aging-related diseases and dysfunctions in mice. Metformin, a biguanide&#xD;
      antidiabetic drug, reduces the risk for developing type-2 diabetes in persons at risk by over&#xD;
      one-third with few adverse effects (e.g., gastrointestinal irritation). Metformin prevents&#xD;
      type-2 diabetes primarily through decreasing hepatic glucose synthesis, as well as enhancing&#xD;
      insulin sensitivity and increasing peripheral glucose uptake. The molecular mechanisms remain&#xD;
      unclear, although a number of potential mechanism such as activation of AMP-activated protein&#xD;
      kinase (AMPK) and inhibition of mitochondrial glycerophosphate dehydrogenase have been&#xD;
      proposed. The fact that metformin treatment in persons with type-2 diabetes has been&#xD;
      associated with reduced risk of other aging-related diseases and conditions, including&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease, cancer and cognitive decline supports the possibility of the&#xD;
      beneficial effects of metformin on healthy aging. It is imperative to capitalize on these&#xD;
      leads to extend health span among older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To translate animal findings to human intervention trials, appropriate aging biomarkers are&#xD;
      needed. Methylomic and transcriptomic profiles in relevant cells may reflect molecular&#xD;
      features that mediate effects of both genetic and environmental factors on aging-related&#xD;
      functional decline and disease. The roles of monocytes have been implicated in development of&#xD;
      many aging-related diseases such as cardiovascular disease, cancer and neurodegenerative&#xD;
      disease. In a cross-sectional association study of 1,200 monocyte samples, we identified&#xD;
      1,794 age-associated methylation sites and 2,704 age-associated transcripts, which were&#xD;
      over-represented in two networks (autophagy and oxidative phosphorylation) and suggestive of&#xD;
      decline in those functions with age. Both autophagy and oxidative phosphorylation are&#xD;
      considered as key contributors to the aging process, and their dysfunctions have been linked&#xD;
      to aging-related diseases. Changes in these aging-related omic biomarkers may be early&#xD;
      indicators of cellular damage or disruption that eventually leads to age-related&#xD;
      dysfunctions. Assessment of these aging biomarkers in response to therapeutic intervention&#xD;
      may also provide molecular insight for personalizing treatment. The investigators propose a&#xD;
      pilot study to examine changes in aging-related omic profiles after 3 months of metformin&#xD;
      treatment in 35 monocyte samples from older adults using a randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled crossover study design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our overarching goal of the pilot study is to evaluate the utility of using the aging-related&#xD;
      omic biomarkers as an indicator of pharmacologic responses in the anti-aging therapeutic&#xD;
      intervention trials through the following specific aims. Although this pilot study does not&#xD;
      have sufficient power to definitively test all the aims, it will provide essential&#xD;
      preliminary data for developing a full scale research program.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 1A: To test the effects of the metformin treatment on transcriptomic profiles and&#xD;
           related functional changes in human monocytes,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 1B: To explore the effects of the metformin treatment on methylomic profiles in&#xD;
           human monocytes,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 2: To investigate the longitudinal relationship between transcriptional and&#xD;
           functional changes in human monocytes during the metformin treatment and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 3: To test the effects of the metformin treatment on frailty and other aging-related&#xD;
           physical and cognitive measures and investigate the longitudinal relationship between&#xD;
           these changes and transcriptional changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial in 30 participants using&#xD;
      metformin and matching placebo will be used. In the absence of a treatment by sequence&#xD;
      interaction effect, this design can increase study power for evaluating treatment effects by&#xD;
      allowing each participant to be his/her own control. The period effect may be minimum because&#xD;
      the primary outcomes, methylation and transcriptional measures, are relatively stable&#xD;
      overtime.&#xD;

    <description>Metformin dosing at 425, 850 and 1700 mg with GLUCOPHAGEÂ® (metformin hydrochloride) Tablets. Treatment with metformin will be initiated at a dose of 425 mg (half pill) taken orally once a day at night for 7 days. After the week, the participant will be called to assess tolerance and will be asked to increase dose to one pill at night at a dose of 850 mg for one week. At the end of the second week, participants will be called again and if they tolerated the second dose, they will be asked to take two 850 mg pills, one in the morning and one at night, for a total dose of 1700 mg which is within the range of the usual effective dose of 1500 to 2000 mg/day for the remainder of the 3 months. Will then cross over to 3 months on placebo.</description>
