  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is an exploratory prospective, single center study with correlative endpoints. The&#xD;
      study will investigate the association of tumor cGAS STING signaling with SAbR. Tumor core&#xD;
      biopsies will be processed and analyzed as described above. Medical records electronic&#xD;
      medical records will be used to collect demographic and medical information and imaging&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Within 2 weeks of planned SAbR, patients will have a core biopsy of the lesion to receive&#xD;
      SAbR. Laboratory values will be obtained prior to biopsy. Once the laboratory values are&#xD;
      found to be within the safe margin for biopsy, multiple (approximately 5) core biopsies will&#xD;
      be obtained with an 18-guage or 19-gauge needle under CT or US guidance. Tissue will be snap&#xD;
      frozen with liquid nitrogen and immediately transferred to the laboratory of Dr. Zhijian&#xD;
      &quot;James&quot; Chen, PhD, Professor, Department of Molecular Biology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAbR will be administered as per the guidelines of UTSW with a single 24-27Gy or three 10-14&#xD;
      Gy/fraction fractions totaling 33-48Gy. Lesions receiving SAbR will be called &quot;radiated&quot;&#xD;
      lesions. Prior irradiated lesions will be excluded. SABR will be administered within 2 weeks&#xD;
      of the study initial core biopsy. The SAbR dose and fractionation scheme is generated to&#xD;
      deliver a potent dose to ablate the targeted lesions and at the same time maximize an immune&#xD;
      response. Since multiple studies have shown an influx of lymphocytes and monocytes after&#xD;
      tumor irradiation and since these cells play a critical role in antigen presentation and&#xD;
      initiation of an adaptive immune response, multiple fraction irradiation which would kill&#xD;
      these infiltrating immunocytes, is discouraged. Therefore a single fraction or a three&#xD;
      fraction treatment regimen is recommended, and a single fraction treatment is preferred over&#xD;
      three fractions. Due to normal organ toxicity and limits of dose constraints, sometimes a&#xD;
      three fraction treatment must be undertaken and in those cases it is recommended that the&#xD;
      treatment course is completed within 7-10 days-preferably 5 business days. Radiation&#xD;
      dose-immune response studies have shown a linear increase in immune response with increased&#xD;
      dose per fraction of radiation without demonstration of a plateau. Two studies comparing 15Gy&#xD;
      x 1 vs 5Gy x3, and 20Gy x1 vs 5Gy x4 have shown a superior immune response generated by the&#xD;
      single fraction radiation. Clinical experience with oligometastatic patients treated at 1-5&#xD;
      sites of disease has also showed an increase in progression-free survival with the increasing&#xD;
      radiation dose per fraction. A dose of less than 7.5 Gy per fraction has demonstrated lower&#xD;
      induction of systemic IFN-Î³ producing cells, and a previous phase II study of mRCC patients&#xD;
      treated with HD IL-2 and singe fraction of 8Gy irradiation to a single lesion did not show an&#xD;
      overall improvement in response rate. Therefore 8Gy per fraction is the lowest permitted dose&#xD;
      for this study and can be used only when administering the three fraction regimen as&#xD;
      described in the prescription dose table below. Investigators will have discretion in&#xD;
      choosing from either of the biologically equivalent dose levels using one or three fractions,&#xD;
      although a single fraction is preferred over three fraction treatments. Treating physician&#xD;
      will have further discretion in selecting the number and location of sites to treat if&#xD;
      multiple sites of disease are present. Maximum number of lesions treated is deemed as&#xD;
      feasible per the treating radiation oncologist. However, for the purposes of this protocol,&#xD;
      only a single site will be studied and must be safely amenable to repeat core biopsy. Thus,&#xD;
      the single site for the study will be either in subcutaneous tissues, nodes, isolated masses&#xD;
      or liver. The gross target/tumor volume--GTV should be at least 2 cm3 in size, corresponding&#xD;
      to roughly a 1.5 cm diameter tumor. This is to ensure that adequate tumor volume for therapy&#xD;
      and for biopsy and therefore adequate tumor cells roughly 108 -109 cells/cm3 are killed for&#xD;
      antigen presentation. Treating physicians should choose their dose based on established&#xD;
      planning guidelines at their center including their ability to respect normal tissue&#xD;
      tolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 24 + 6 hours of the first SAbR, a second core biopsy of the &quot;target&quot; irradiated lesion&#xD;
      will be performed identically to the first biopsy.&#xD;
