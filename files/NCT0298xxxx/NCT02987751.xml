      This study is a multicentre, randomized, open label on comparison of a Long-Acting Basal&#xD;
      Insulin Analog Glargine plus Glulisine with Premixed Insulin in Adult Patients with Type 2&#xD;
      Diabetes Mellitus in 200 patients that will be conducted in seven centers in Tamil Nadu. The&#xD;
      primary outcome measures will be to compare the change in HbA1c from baseline to week 24&#xD;
      between Glargine OD + Glulisine in comparison with Premixed insulin initiation in insulin&#xD;
      naïve patients with T2DM. The secondary outcomes is to compare the following in the two arms&#xD;
      between baseline and 24 weeks Fasting plasma glucose, Postprandial glucose, 7-point&#xD;
      self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG) profiles, Percentage of participants with HbA1c &lt; 7%,&#xD;
      Insulin dose, Overall adverse events, Symptomatic Hypoglycemia, Severe hypoglycemic, Weight,&#xD;
      BMI and Blood pressure.&#xD;

      The subjects will be invited to the study centre from the local population who are willing to&#xD;
      participate in the trial. Each subject will be informed both orally and in writing about the&#xD;
      study prior to inclusion in the study and only the subjects who give written informed consent&#xD;
      will be included. The selection of the subjects is based on the inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria defined in the protocol. The selected subjects will be given a screening number and&#xD;
      subjected to screening procedure to find out eligible candidates for enrollment. The&#xD;
      screening procedure includes obtaining subject's anthropometric data, baseline&#xD;
      symptomatology, medical history, vital signs, physical examination, laboratory investigations&#xD;
      like blood glucose (fasting &amp; 2hr after meal), HbA1c, Urea, Creatinine, Liver function test,&#xD;
      Lipid profile, Urine albumin/creatinine ratio, urine pregnancy (if applicable) and ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be followed by 2 weeks run in period for eligible patients to ensure patients are&#xD;
      on stable dose of oral therapy and Metformin not &lt; 1500 mg/day. Sulfonylurea will be stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the eligible patients as per the inclusion criteria (HbA1c ≥7.5% to ≤ 10.5%, fasting&#xD;
      blood glucose ≥ 150 mg/dl, and/or Postprandial blood glucose ≥ 200 mg/dl) will be randomized&#xD;
      in two arms. Participants in arm-1 will receive once daily insulin Glargine (12 units) plus&#xD;
      once daily Glulisine (4 units) at breakfast/dinner, along with OHAs at stable dose and&#xD;
      titrated optimally. Participants in the arm-2 will receive once daily premix analogue insulin&#xD;
      (30/70) 16 units at breakfast/dinner, along with OHAs at stable dose and will be titrated as&#xD;
      per the treatment algorithm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the randomization visit, the selected subjects after the run in period will be given a&#xD;
      subject number and randomized between two arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometric measurements and vital sign will be taken. Concomitant medication and adverse&#xD;
      events will be noted. Glucose meter, strips, Insulin and study diary will be dispensed.&#xD;
      Training on Glucose meter usage, hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia symptoms, Insulin injection&#xD;
      technique and dose titration technique will be done. Subjects will be instructed to maintain&#xD;
      the record of dosing details in the patient diary. They will be given Diet and Exercise&#xD;
      counselling. They will be asked to hand over the study diary and Insulin pen (empty or full)&#xD;
      to the coordinator at each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First three months will be an insulin dose titration period in which the subjects will be&#xD;
      asked to visit the clinic at 12 weeks. Telephonic visit at week 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10&#xD;
      and 11. At week 4, and 8 investigator can have an unscheduled visit for training or insulin&#xD;
      dispensing. During the telephonic visit subjects will be asked about concomitant medication&#xD;
      and adverse events. During clinic visit at 12 weeks or unscheduled visit at week 4 or 8&#xD;
      anthropometric measurements, vital signs, concomitant medication and adverse event will be&#xD;
      recorded. Glucometer strips, Insulin and study diary will be dispensed. The Insulin and study&#xD;
      diary given during previous visit will be collected. The dose of Insulin will be titrated&#xD;
      according to the algorithm given in appendix below with the 7 point SMBG done by the subject&#xD;
      ±5 days before the following weeks 4, 8 &amp; 12 and also insulin dose can be titrated by finger&#xD;
      prick FBS and PPBS done at week 2, 6 and 10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 3 months, participants in arm-1 may undergo intensification to 2 injections of&#xD;
      Glulisine if HbA1c is &gt; 7% and/or 2-h postprandial glucose is &gt;140 mg/dL. After 3 months,&#xD;
      participants in arm-2 premix OD can be made BD if HbA1c is &gt; 7% and/or 2-h postprandial&#xD;
      glucose is &gt;140 mg/dL despite effective titration of existing doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The next three months will be an insulin dose maintenance period in which the subjects will&#xD;
      be asked to visit the clinic at 24 week. At week 16 and 20 telephonic visit or an unscheduled&#xD;
      visit will be performed. During the telephonic visit they will be asked about concomitant&#xD;
      medication and adverse events. During clinic visit at 24 weeks or unscheduled visit at week&#xD;
      16 or 20, anthropometric measurements, vital signs, concomitant medication and adverse event&#xD;
      will be recorded. Glucometer strips, Insulin and study diary will be dispensed. The Insulin&#xD;
      and study diary given during previous visit will be collected. The dose of Insulin, if needed&#xD;
      will be titrated according to algorithm given in appendix below with the 7 point SMBG done by&#xD;
      the subjects ±5 days before the following week 16, week 20 and week 24.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the clinic visit at weeks 12 and 24, Medical history, Physical examination, laboratory&#xD;
      investigations like blood glucose (fasting &amp; 2hr after meal), HbA1c, Urea, Creatinine, Liver&#xD;
      function test, Lipid profile, Urine albumin/creatinine ratio, urine pregnancy (if applicable)&#xD;
      and ECG at week 24 will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the end of study visit at week 24 the subject will undergo medical examination,&#xD;
      anthropometric measurements, vital signs, concomitant medication and adverse event will be&#xD;
      recorded. The Insulin and study diary given during previous visit will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects experiencing any hypoglycemia should inform the coordinator or the investigator over&#xD;
      the phone and make an unscheduled visit. In case they experience adverse event should inform&#xD;
      the coordinator or the investigator over the phone and make an unscheduled visit as per&#xD;
      investigator's discretion.&#xD;
