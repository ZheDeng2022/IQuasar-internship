  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-center clinical trial, aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety&#xD;
      of combination of oral Navelbine and Cisplatin followed by metronomic oral Navelbine in&#xD;
      Patients with advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study comprises two stages. In the 1st stage (Week 1-12), all patients will receive&#xD;
      combination chemotherapy. In the 2nd stage (Week 13-25), patients who complete the&#xD;
      combination chemotherapy with acceptable tolerance and have no progressive disease (PD) will&#xD;
      be allocated into 2 arms, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of maintenance chemotherapy&#xD;
      with metronomic oral Navelbine (Arm A) or other regimen (Arm B).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the 1st stage (Week 1-12), all patients will receive combination chemotherapy, i.e.&#xD;
      Platinum and Navelbine, for 4 cycles. The regimen is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Navelbine oral 60mg/m2 d1,8 the first cycle; oral 80mg/m2 day1,8 in sequential cycles q3w&#xD;
      plus cisplatin: 75mg/m2 d1 q3w.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the 2nd stage (Week 13-25), patients who complete the combination chemotherapy with&#xD;
      acceptable tolerance and have no PD will be allocated into 2 arms, to evaluate the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of maintenance chemotherapy with metronomic oral Navelbine (Arm A) or other&#xD;
      regimen (Arm B). The allocation will be done in sequence at each site, i.e., the first&#xD;
      subject who complete the combination chemotherapy with acceptable tolerance and have no PD&#xD;
      will be allocated to Arm A, and the second will be allocated to Arm B, and so on. Arm A will&#xD;
      continue with oral Navelbine 3 times weekly as maintenance therapy, up to 12 weeks, or till&#xD;
      progression, unacceptable toxicity or death occurred. As contrast, Arm B will receive other&#xD;
      therapy as per the physician's choice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm A: Navelbine oral 50mg three times per week (Day 1, 3, 5 of each week ) Arm B:&#xD;
      Physician's choice (other than Navelbine oral) computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI) will be done at the screening visit, Week 7, Week 13 (before the initiation of&#xD;
      maintenance therapy), Week 19 (after 6 weeks of maintenance therapy), and Week 25 (after 12&#xD;
      weeks of maintenance therapy), to evaluate the tumor response. The Disease Control Rate&#xD;
      (proportion of patients in complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease&#xD;
      (SD)) after 6 weeks and 12 weeks of maintenance therapy will be evaluated separately for the&#xD;
      2 arms. And Arm B is for observational study only, and will provide rationale for control&#xD;
      group selecting in future study.&#xD;
