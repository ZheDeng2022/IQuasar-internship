  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I/II, randomized, blinded and placebo-controlled study to test the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of Lomecel-B for improving vaccine immune response.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A pilot phase will consist of a 3 subject safety run-in, followed by 20 subject randomized&#xD;
      phase to evaluate influenza vaccine response at 1 week and 4 weeks post infusion of Lomecel-B&#xD;
      (Formerly LMSCs). This will be followed by a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      phase.&#xD;
