      The purpose of this study is to investigate the short and long term clinical and cognitive&#xD;
      effects of repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) at 5 Hz and/or 10 Hz&#xD;
      frequencies on the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in cocaine dependent patients and to&#xD;
      examine possible changes in brain structure and functional connectivity associated with this&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been shown to reduce craving in&#xD;
      cocaine addicts in the short term. However, there are no studies on the long term clinical&#xD;
      and cognitive effects of sustained rTMS therapy. Moreover, clinical improvement or decline&#xD;
      could be related to long term changes in brain structure and function. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to investigate the short and long term clinical and cognitive effects of repetitive&#xD;
      Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) at 5 Hz and/or 10 Hz frequencies on the left&#xD;
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in cocaine dependent patients and to examine possible changes&#xD;
      in brain structure and functional connectivity associated with this intervention. For this&#xD;
      purpose the investigators will recruit cocaine dependent patients and stimulate them using&#xD;
      rTMS with a acute intervention (twice a day for 2 weeks) and a maintenance intervention&#xD;
      (twice a week for 3 months). The investigators will follow the patients to determine clinical&#xD;
      outcome. The investigators will also measure clinical, cognitive and brain structural and&#xD;
      functional connectivity to asses changes related to the intervention in the short and long&#xD;
      term (measurements at: baseline, 2 weeks and 3 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The projects consists of: Screening Visit, Part 1 and Part 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, there will be a screening visit, where a clinical interview will be conducted and&#xD;
      tests will be applied to select study participants who meet the inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline clinical, cognitive and neuroimaging data will be acquired. The cognitive and&#xD;
      neuroimaging data will be exploratory, to be associated with the outcome measures. Part 1 of&#xD;
      the study entails the determination of the rTMS target frequency (5 or 10 Hz) for Part 2&#xD;
      (long term stimulation). In Part 1, all participants will be randomly assigned to one of the&#xD;
      four treatment legs with rTMS (10Hz, 10Hz-Sham, 5Hz, 5Hz-Sham). Participants will receive 20&#xD;
      sessions of rTMS (intervention or sham), twice per day for 10 consecutive days. Each session&#xD;
      lasts approximately 35 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 2 weeks, the investigators will evaluate the short term effect of treatment by measuring&#xD;
      clinical, cognitive and neuroimaging changes and select which frequency of stimulation is the&#xD;
      most effective in terms of clinical improvement, but also in terms of the rate of secondary&#xD;
      effects. Our hypothesis is that 5 Hz is as effective as 10 Hz without the high rate of&#xD;
      secondary effects (i.e. seizures).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part 2 of the study, the sham groups will end and they will be invited to the treatment&#xD;
      condition although they data not will be considered for later phases. Here the maintenance&#xD;
      phase starts (long term), where rTMS will be performed twice a week for 12 months using the&#xD;
      target frequency (5 or 10 Hz). Clinical, cognitive and neuroimaging data will be acquired at&#xD;
      2 weeks and 3 months.&#xD;

Each patient will receive treatment stimulation in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (lDLPFC) with a frequency of 5 Hz, that includes 2 sessions per day for 10 consecutive business days for 2 weeks.
