      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical activity and tolerability of a&#xD;
      combination of obinutuzumab plus venetoclax in patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse&#xD;
      large B-cell lymphoma.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will have a 6 patient run-in phase to determine safety and to adjust treatment.&#xD;
      Once the sixth patient has completed 21 days of treatment, withdrawn due to toxicity, or&#xD;
      died, a formal review will be undertaken by the sponsor (AGMT). Enrolment will be halted&#xD;
      until review is completed. If one (1) treatment related death is reported or three (3) or&#xD;
      more patients experience CTC grade 4 events other than neutropenia, anemia, or&#xD;
      thrombocytopenia, the study will be stopped for further recruitment. If the stopping criteria&#xD;
      are not met, enrollment will be continued. A futility analysis will be conducted when the&#xD;
      first 10 patients have been evaluated for response: If at least 2 patients had an objective&#xD;
      response (CR or PR), the study will be continued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination treatment will be repeated for up to 3 cycles. The first response assessment&#xD;
      (including PET-CT) will be performed after the first cycle of obinutuzumab-venetoclax and&#xD;
      patients with at least stable disease (SD) or better will be given another 2 cycles of&#xD;
      therapy and then have assessment after a total of 3 cycles. Patients with complete or partial&#xD;
      remission (CR, PR) after 3 cycles of therapy will either go on to transplant or receive 9&#xD;
      further cycles of the combination therapy (if transplant ineligible). Patients with&#xD;
      progressive disease at any time-point or stable disease after 3 cycles will be taken off&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
