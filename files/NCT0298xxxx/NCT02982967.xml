      The purpose of present study was to investigate the effect of 10 weeks of recreational&#xD;
      physical activity program on the irisin levels, progenitor endothelial cells and&#xD;
      cardiometabolic profile in healthy children. Also, we investigated the correlation between&#xD;
      this markers with anthropometric data, body composition, cardiac autonomic balance and&#xD;
      physical fitness parameters. We evaluated eighty children aged 6 to 14 participated in the&#xD;
      recreational physical activity program by 10 weeks (Duration: 60 minutes; Intensity: 65%-85%&#xD;
      heart rate reserve; Frequency: 4 sessions/week). All parameters were evaluated before and&#xD;
      after this approach.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This cross-sectional study was conducted in a representative group of children aged 6 to 14&#xD;
      identified in the Youth Healthcare Centre located near the Federal University of São Paulo&#xD;
      (São Paulo, SP, Brazil). A total of 110 children were identified during the study period.&#xD;
      However, five individuals with respiratory problems and 12 individuals who did not agree to&#xD;
      participate were excluded from the study. In addition, 13 individuals who have not completed&#xD;
      anthropometric, metabolic or physical fitness assessments in the post-training period were&#xD;
      also excluded. Therefore, 80 children (32 girls and 48 boys) were included for this study. No&#xD;
      child had any clinical signs of musculoskeletal or orthopedic disorders that prevented them&#xD;
      from performing the proposed physical fitness tests. The Ethics Committee of the Federal&#xD;
      University of São Paulo approved the study protocol (Number: 795.262). All parents and&#xD;
      children signed written informed consent/assent forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Design: Each child completed the experimental protocol over a period of 10 weeks&#xD;
      consisting of the baseline measurements of anthropometric data, body composition, irisin&#xD;
      levels, metabolic and physical fitness parameters. All these measurements were repeated after&#xD;
      the 10-week recreational physical activity program and were carried out within 72 hours after&#xD;
      the last training session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recreational Physical Activity Program: Participants performed 10 weeks of recreational&#xD;
      physical activity program on circuit training, that consists of exercise program for&#xD;
      flexibility, coordination, strength (upper and lower limbs), aerobic resistance controlled by&#xD;
      use of the Polar S810i monitor (Polar Electro OY, Finland; sampling rate=100Hz) and dynamic&#xD;
      balance to improve the functional capacity. A total of 40 sessions were performed with&#xD;
      duration (60 minutes), intensity (65%-85% heart rate reserve), and frequency (4&#xD;
      sessions/week). Each session consisted of three parts: Warm-up (10 minutes), physical&#xD;
      activity session (45 minutes) and cool down (5 minutes). Moreover, subjective Borg scale of&#xD;
      perceived exertion was applied to all children for control of the training intensity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometry: Body weight and height were measured in light clothing without shoes using a&#xD;
      standard balance beam scale. Waist and hip circumferences were measured using inextensible&#xD;
      tape. Waist circumference was recorded at a level midway between the lower rib margin and the&#xD;
      iliac crest at the end of normal expiration. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body Composition: Body composition was evaluated using bioelectrical impedance with a&#xD;
      single-frequency hand-to-foot (ImpediMed DF50 monitor, Impedimed, Australia). Children were&#xD;
      asked to avoid physical activity and to consume liquids 2 hours before evaluation to prevent&#xD;
      errors in measurement due to fluid imbalances. This evaluation was performed after 5 minutes&#xD;
      of rest in the supine position, and the electrodes were applied to the hand, wrist, ankle and&#xD;
      foot of the right-hand side of the body. Body fat was calculated with prediction equations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiorespiratory Fitness: The 20-meter shuttle run test (20MST) was performed to estimated&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory fitness. The test starts at 8 km/h and increases by 0.5 km/h every minute.&#xD;
      This test was carried out in a plane surface, and explained by the field team member. All&#xD;
      children made adaptations to the 20MST test. The velocity in the last stage completed by each&#xD;
      child was recorded and used to calculate the VO2max (ml/kg/min) according to the equation&#xD;
      proposed by Léger et al.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standing Broad Jump: The child stands behind a line marked on the ground. A two foot take-off&#xD;
      and landing is used, with swinging of the arms, the child jumps as far as possible with both&#xD;
      feet simultaneously. The test item score (better of three attempts) is the distance between&#xD;
      the starting line and the landing position (measured in centimeters).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sit and Reach Test: The flexibility was evaluated by use of the Wells Bench. For this test,&#xD;
      the child performed the movement with hands overlapped, feet rested on the bench and knees&#xD;
      totally extended with aid from the researcher. The result was given by the maximum distance&#xD;
      obtained in three attempts, respecting a one-minute interval between them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Handgrip Strength Test: Grip strength was measured for both hands using a digital dynamometer&#xD;
      (Kern &amp; Sohn, Model MAP 80K1S, Germany). In this test, the child was seated in appropriately&#xD;
      sized chairs, shoulder abducted, elbow in 90 degrees flexion, and wrist in neutral position.&#xD;
      After that, the researcher asked the child to perform the greatest possible force in the&#xD;
      shortest time. The mean of three maximum voluntary contractions was recorded for each hand&#xD;
      and expressed in Kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood Collection and Biochemical Variables: In the morning (7:00 - 9: 00hrs) after overnight&#xD;
      fasting, the blood venous samples (10 ml) were collected by venipuncture of a forearm vein&#xD;
      into separate vacutainer tubes containing spray-dried K2EDTA anticoagulant or with gel serum&#xD;
      separator. EDTA samples were centrifuged within 1 hour after blood collection (4°C - 1,500 g&#xD;
      for 15 min) and plasma aliquots for irisin measurement were stored at -80°C until assay.&#xD;
      Automated enzymatic procedures were used to measure glucose and insulin by routine methods in&#xD;
      Clinical Laboratory of the Kidney &amp; Hypertension Hospital. Insulin resistance was calculated&#xD;
      by the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR) method, according to the following formula:&#xD;
      [glucose (mg/dl)/18 x insulin (mUI/ml)]/22.5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of Irisin: Plasma irisin levels were determined using commercially available ELISA&#xD;
      kit (MyBioSource, Catalog Number: MBS 706887, San Diego, CA, USA). The intra assay and inter&#xD;
      assay coefficients of variation were less than 8%. These assays were performed in duplicate,&#xD;
      and to remove any bias, the researcher devised blind analysis techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemodynamic Variables and Heart Rate Variability: Blood pressure levels were measured twice&#xD;
      in the right arm with the child in a seated position using an automated oscillometric device&#xD;
      (Omron HEM907XL; Omron Healthcare; USA) with an appropriate cuff size. The blood pressure&#xD;
      value was the average of three measurements made at 2-min intervals . After this procedure,&#xD;
      children were asked to lay silently in a supine position on a bed with minimal body movement&#xD;
      and to maintain spontaneous breathing for 10 minutes to record both resting heart rate and&#xD;
      short-term heart rate variability using a Polar S810i monitor (Polar Electro OY, Finland;&#xD;
      sampling rate=100Hz) . The same researcher blinded to the clinical data conducted the&#xD;
      assessment of all children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Processing of the Heart Rate Variability Data: The heart rate variability indices were&#xD;
      calculated as previously described 27, 28. Briefly, normal beat to beat intervals were&#xD;
      transferred from Polar S810i to Precision Performance Software by an infrared interface&#xD;
      device. These data were processed in a specific previous routine designed in MatLab (Math&#xD;
      Works, 6.0 version, USA) for the automatic selection of 5 minutes RR with the smallest&#xD;
      variance. Afterwards, these time series lasting 5 minutes were analyzed in Kubios software&#xD;
      (Biosignal Analysis and Medical Image Group, University of Kuopio, Finland). In this&#xD;
      software, the artifacts were corrected with a moderated filter, and the time-domain&#xD;
      components were calculated. The following time-domain indices were analyzed: heart rate (HR),&#xD;
      MNN (average of all normal RR interval), SDNN (standard deviation of RR intervals), RMSSD&#xD;
      (root mean square of successive differences RR intervals), and pNN50 (percent RR intervals&#xD;
      with a difference in duration higher than 50 ms). The frequency-domain components were also&#xD;
      evaluated by a 2 power spectrum. The classical frequency low frequency (LF= 0.041-0.15 Hz)&#xD;
      and high frequency (HF= 0.15-0.40 Hz) bands were expressed in normalized units (n.u.).&#xD;
      Moreover, the ratio of LF/HF was also calculated. Spectral analysis was estimated as&#xD;
      recommended using the non-parametric method of fast Fourier Transform Algorithms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Isolation of Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells: In this assay 5-6 mL from peripheral blood&#xD;
      were collected in EDTA tubes. Under sterile conditions, tibia and femur cavities were flushed&#xD;
      with DMEM (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's medium, GIBCO, USA) to obtain bone marrow (BM). PB and&#xD;
      BM were fractioned by gradient density centrifugation (2.500 rpm, 25 min, 20-22°C)&#xD;
      (Ficoll-Paque, GE, Germany), and then, mononuclear cells obtained from its samples were&#xD;
      addressed to number quantification and in vitro function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endothelial progenitor cells Immunophenotyping and Quantification by Flow Cytometer:&#xD;
      mononuclear cells was considered endothelial progenitor cells as CD34+/VEGFR2+ cells.&#xD;
      Briefly, 1x106 mononuclear cells were individually incubated (room temperature, in the dark,&#xD;
      30 min) with the following antibodies: anti-CD34-PeCY7 plus VEGFR2-FITC or with isotype&#xD;
      controls anti-IgG-PE-Cy7 plus IgG-FITC . After incubation, cells were washed in PBS and fixed&#xD;
      in 1% paraformaldehyde solution. Fixed cells were kept (4°C, in the dark, for 15-20 hours),&#xD;
      and then analyzed in flow cytometer (FACSCANTO, BD Biosciences, USA) by collecting 1.000.000&#xD;
      events. Data were analyzed using BD FACSDIVA Software . Gates were established on the&#xD;
      forward- and side-scatter (FSC/SSC) plot corresponding to select mononuclear cells followed&#xD;
      by CD34-PeCY7 plus VEGFR2-FITC gate . Number of EPCs (CD34+/VEGFR2+) was calculated as the&#xD;
      percentage of CMNs events30.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endothelial progenitor cells - Functional Capacity in vitro Assay: Mononuclear cells were&#xD;
      individually addressed to colony forming unit in vitro. Briefly, 5x106 MNCs were cultured&#xD;
      (37°C, 5% CO2, 95% humidity) on 6-wells pre-coated fibronectin seeded with EndoCult medium .&#xD;
      After 48 hours, 1x106 non-adherent cells were transferred in triplicate onto 24-wells&#xD;
      pre-coated fibronectin and cultured for 72-96 hours (37°C, 5% CO2, 95% humidity) in EndoCult&#xD;
      medium. Following, the colony forming units were counted manually by 2 blinded observers in&#xD;
      inverted microscope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis: Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS version 21.0 for Windows&#xD;
      (IBM Corporation, USA). Categorical variables were compared using the chi-square test. All&#xD;
      continuous variables were examined for normality with the Shapiro-Wilk test. Since our data&#xD;
      had a nonparametric distribution was used Wilcoxon test for paired data in order to evaluate&#xD;
      the difference between the baseline and post-Recreational physical activity program values.&#xD;
      In addition, we used Spearman's rho correlation coefficient to determine the relationship&#xD;
      between irisin and independent factors. The data were expressed as the mean ± standard&#xD;
      deviation. Statistical tests were two-tailed and the significance level was set at P&lt;0.05.&#xD;
