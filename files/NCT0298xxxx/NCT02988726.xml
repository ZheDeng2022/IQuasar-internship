      RATIONALE: Current therapies for adults with a recurrent/residual Neurofibroma or Schwannoma&#xD;
      provide limited benefit to the patient. The anti-cancer properties of Antineoplaston therapy&#xD;
      suggest that it may prove beneficial in the treatment of adults with a recurrent/residual&#xD;
      Neurofibroma or Schwannoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This study is being performed to determine the effects (good and bad) that&#xD;
      Antineoplaston therapy has on adults with a recurrent/residual Neurofibroma or Schwannoma.&#xD;

      OVERVIEW: This is a single arm, open-label study in which adults with a recurrent/residual&#xD;
      Neurofibroma or Schwannoma receive gradually escalating doses of intravenous Antineoplaston&#xD;
      therapy (Atengenal + Astugenal) until the maximum tolerated dose is reached. Treatment&#xD;
      continues for at least 12 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the efficacy of Antineoplaston therapy in adults with a recurrent/residual&#xD;
           Neurofibroma or Schwannoma, as measured by an objective response to therapy (complete&#xD;
           response, partial response or stable disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the safety and tolerance of Antineoplaston therapy in adults with a&#xD;
           recurrent/residual Neurofibroma or Schwannoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine objective response, tumor size is measured utilizing MRI scans, which are&#xD;
           performed every 8 weeks for the first two years, every 3 months for the third and fourth&#xD;
           years, every 6 months for the 5th and sixth years, and annually thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued to this study.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically confirmed incurable Neurofibroma or Schwannoma. Histological&#xD;
             confirmation is waived for tumor location where biopsy cannot be safely performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  There will be no exclusion based on multifocality, or leptomeningeal or systemic&#xD;
             metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The tumor must be at least 5 mm in size.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Radiologic evidence of residual or recurrent tumor by gadolinium-enhanced MRI&#xD;
             performed no more than 14 days before the beginning of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have previously received radiation therapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy&#xD;
             or cytodifferentiating agents are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who did not receive standard therapy are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may be male or female. If female, the patient must not be pregnant or&#xD;
             breast-feeding an infant, and either incapable of becoming pregnant or currently using&#xD;
             contraceptive methods. Acceptable methods include the birth control pill, use of a&#xD;
             diaphragm, intrauterine device, or condom by the patient's sexual partner. If male,&#xD;
             the patient should use appropriate contraception, such as condoms, during the study&#xD;
             and at least 4 weeks following completion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must sign the Informed Consent Document indicting an awareness of the&#xD;
             experimental nature of this study. In the event the patient has impairment of higher&#xD;
             intellectual function, for example, aphasia, the the patient's legal next of kin or&#xD;
             legal guardian must sign the Informed Consent Document indicating an awareness of the&#xD;
             experimental nature of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must fully recover from the operative procedure and have life expectancy of&#xD;
             two months or more. The patient's performance status should be consistent with&#xD;
             outpatient therapy, i.e., 60% - 100% Karnofsky. The use of corticosteroids is&#xD;
             permitted to reduce symptoms attributed to cerebral edema. It is recommended that the&#xD;
             smallest dose be used compatible with the preservation of optimal neurological&#xD;
             function.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Minimal hematological parameters include a hemoglobin of at least 9 g/dL, a white&#xD;
             blood count of at least 1500, and a platelet count of at least 50,000.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with no evidence of hepatic or renal insufficiency; a total serum bilirubin&#xD;
             and creatinine not higher than 2.5 mg/dL; and a SGOT and SGPT not higher than 5 times&#xD;
             the upper limit of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must recover from the adverse effect of previous therapy. At least eight&#xD;
             weeks must have lapsed since the last dose of radiation therapy and at least four&#xD;
             weeks must have lapsed since the last dose of chemotherapy (six weeks for&#xD;
             nitrosoureas) or immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Failure to meet all inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient either pregnant or breast feeding an infant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is a high medical or psychiatric risk, having non-malignant systemic disease,&#xD;
             which would, in the opinion of the investigator, make therapy with an investigational&#xD;
             agent unwise.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is incompetent to give informed consent to treatment. However, the patient may&#xD;
             be admitted if a legally appointed guardian gives consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of an active infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known chronic heart failure and serious lung disease, such as severe&#xD;
             COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with hypertension are excluded unless the hypertension is adequately&#xD;
             controlled.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had prior Antineoplaston treatment should be excluded from this&#xD;
             protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who do not have adequate hepatic function.&#xD;
