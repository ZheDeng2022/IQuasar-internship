  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is the aim of the present study to compare the immunogenicity induced by a laser-assisted&#xD;
      epidermally administered seasonal influenza vaccine to an intradermally administered seasonal&#xD;
      influenza vaccine.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The skin is an attractive tissue for vaccination due to the impact of the cutaneous&#xD;
      micro-environment on the adaptive and non-adaptive immune responses. Conventionally many&#xD;
      vaccines are administered subcutaneously. Immune-competent cells however are not resident in&#xD;
      the subcutaneous fat tissue, but instead are located in the epidermis and the dermis of the&#xD;
      skin. Depending on the targeted skin layer and administration method, different immunological&#xD;
      outcomes are thus anticipated following vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study, the immunogenicity (in terms of activation of B-cell mediated and&#xD;
      T-cell mediated immune responses) of laser-assisted epidermally administered seasonal&#xD;
      influenza vaccine will be compared to needle-based intradermal administration of the same&#xD;
      seasonal influenza vaccine.&#xD;
