  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of the study drug, atezolizumab, when&#xD;
      combined with the standard chemotherapy drugs, gemcitabine and cisplatin (or GC). This study&#xD;
      will help researchers begin to understand whether combining GC with atezolizumab is better,&#xD;
      the same, or worse than the usual approach of using GC alone.&#xD;
