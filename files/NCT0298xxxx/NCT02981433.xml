    <textblock>
      Vulvodynia is a syndrome of unexplained vulvar pain that is frequently accompanied by&#xD;
      physical disabilities, limitation of daily activities (such as sitting and walking), sexual&#xD;
      dysfunction and psychologic disability. Originally suggested by McKay, the term &quot;vulvodynia&quot;&#xD;
      has also been suggested by the International Society for the Study of Vulvar Disease Task&#xD;
      Force to describe any vulvar pain. The incidence and prevalence of vulvodynia have not been&#xD;
      well studied. Age distribution for the condition may range from the 20s to the 60s, and it is&#xD;
      limited almost exclusively to white women. Obstetric and gynecologic history is usually&#xD;
      unremarkable. Risk-taking sexual behavior is rare, and few patients have a history of&#xD;
      sexually transmitted diseases. Vulvar pain usually has an acute onset, at times associated&#xD;
      with episodes of vaginitis or certain therapeutic procedures of the vulva (cryotherapy or&#xD;
      laser therapy). In most cases, vulvodynia becomes a chronic problem lasting months to years.&#xD;
      Vulvar pain is frequently described as burning or stinging, or a feeling of rawness or&#xD;
      irritation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most patients consult several physicians before being diagnosed. Many are treated with&#xD;
      multiple topical or systemic medications, with minimal relief. In some cases, inappropriate&#xD;
      therapy may even make the symptoms worse. Since physical findings are few and cultures and&#xD;
      biopsies are frequently negative, patients may be told that the problem is primarily&#xD;
      psychologic, thus invalidating their pain and adding to their distress.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a potent anti-apoptotic sphingolipid with potent&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory actions which are driven in most part by activation of the S1P receptor&#xD;
      subtype S1PR158. Biologically active S1P is generated by the phosphorylation of sphingosine,&#xD;
      catalyzed by two sphingosine kinases (SphK1, SphK2). S1P levels are further regulated by its&#xD;
      dephosphorylation by two phosphatases (SGPP1 and SGPP2) and through degradation by one lyase&#xD;
      (SGPL1). Once released S1P initiates signaling through a family of five cognate G&#xD;
      protein-coupled receptors (S1PR1-5), leading to various cellular responses9. S1P signaling&#xD;
      has important roles in inflammation and cancer. S1P acting via the S1PR1 has been implicated&#xD;
      in the development of pain of several etiologies as discovered by Salvemini and coworkers and&#xD;
      subsequently extended by others. FTY720 (fingolimod/GilenyaÂ®) is the first orally available&#xD;
      agent approved by the FDA for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS).&#xD;
      The work by Salvemini's group in providing a mechanistic basis for understanding chronic pain&#xD;
      through the S1P/S1PR1 axis, provides a promising therapeutic target for the use of agents&#xD;
      like FTY720 as a novel treatment for pain. Ongoing work by the Salvemini's lab suggests that&#xD;
      increased expression of S1PR1 in circulating peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) may provide a&#xD;
      relevant biomarker to predict severity and pain induction outcomes as well as predict patient&#xD;
      responses to anti-S1PR1 approaches.&#xD;
