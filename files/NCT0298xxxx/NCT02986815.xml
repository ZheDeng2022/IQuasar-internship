      At each point that the patient will have [11C]-Acetate PET study, this will be compared with&#xD;
      standard clinical MR imaging. Abbreviations: XRT - radiation therapy; TMZ - temozolomide&#xD;
      (chemotherapy)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative Image Data Analysis: The [11C]-Acetate uptake in tumor sites from images will be&#xD;
      analyzed qualitatively by visual assessment, quantitatively using a standard uptake value&#xD;
      (SUV) in the tumor relative to the contralateral normal brain, and the parameters obtained by&#xD;
      compartmental modeling of dynamic data.&#xD;

      1. [11C]Acetate Administration [11C]Acetate will be administered in the Clinical PET Facility&#xD;
      located on the 2nd floor of the Clements Imaging Building at UT Southwestern. Upon arrival,&#xD;
      the patient will have an opportunity to have questions answered regarding the procedure. The&#xD;
      patient will have one intravenous line placed prior to [11C]Acetate administration. The&#xD;
      patient will receive the low-dose CT portion of a PET/CT scan, after which [11C]Acetate will&#xD;
      be administered intravenously over approximately 1 min at a dose of 0.3 mCi/kg (maximum 30&#xD;
      mCi) and followed by a saline flush. The injection and imaging procedure will be terminated&#xD;
      in any patient who exhibits anaphylaxis, significant dyspnea or chest pain. The administering&#xD;
      physician will stay with the patient for at least 15 min after injection and will remain in&#xD;
      the Clinical PET Facility through the duration of the imaging procedure. All adverse events&#xD;
      occurring post [11C]Acetate infusion will be recorded within a 24-hour period. The adverse&#xD;
      events to be specifically monitored during the infusion include localized discomfort at the&#xD;
      IV injection site, pain, respiratory difficulties, flushing, dizziness, pruritus/rash, and&#xD;
      any other symptoms that could be secondary to an anaphylactic reaction. The subject will be&#xD;
      instructed to report any subjective symptoms or sensory changes noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be imaged on a Siemens Biograph 64 slice PET CT scanner. After placing the&#xD;
      patient on the scanner and securing the head in a head restraint, a low dose CT of the brain&#xD;
      will be acquired. Images with 3 mm slice thickness and spaced at 1.5 mm intervals will be&#xD;
      reconstructed in a 300 mm field of view. The purpose of the CT is for image localization and&#xD;
      attenuation correction and it is not considered to be a diagnostic quality CT. Following the&#xD;
      completion of the CT, the [11C]Acetate will be administered as described in Section VI.F.3.b.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A dynamic PET image will be acquired in 3D list mode for a total of 30 minutes. From the list&#xD;
      mode data a flow image series will be constructed as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  12 frames x 10 seconds each (out to 2 minutes post-injection)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  then 6 frames x 30 seconds each&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  then 1 frame x 60 seconds each&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second series will be -reconstructed to demonstrate dynamic brain regional metabolism as&#xD;
      follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  12 frames x 10 seconds each (out to 2 minutes post-injection)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  then 8 frames x 30 seconds each (from 2 to 6 minutes)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  then 4 frames x 60 seconds each (from 6 to 10 minutes)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  then 2 frames of 300 seconds each (from 10 to 20 minutes)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  then 1 frame of 600 seconds (from 20 to 30 minutes) Reconstructions will be performed&#xD;
           with a 128 x 128 image matrix using 3D OSEM (4 iterations, 21 subsets) and a 3 mm&#xD;
           Gaussian filter.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3. Study Procedures and Schedule of Events:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Initial visits prior to [11C]Acetate PET/CT:&#xD;
&#xD;
                Patients who are identified as potential candidates for the study will be&#xD;
                approached to explain the study and to obtain their written informed consent to be&#xD;
                enrolled in the protocol. The following additional patient data will be obtained:&#xD;
                histologic diagnosis (if a surgical procedure has been carried out), IDH mutational&#xD;
                status, age at radiologic diagnosis, weight, full medical and neurological history&#xD;
                and physical exam. Correlative imaging will be performed using MR brain, with and&#xD;
                without gadolinium, within 14 days prior to enrollment. In addition, when&#xD;
                available, 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) MR spectroscopy will be available for review&#xD;
                and determination of 2HG concentration. For patients referred from outside UTSW and&#xD;
                Parkland hospital, patient records and imaging will be reviewed to determine&#xD;
                eligibility for the study and to obtain baseline comparative imaging scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Day of baseline and follow up [11C]Acetate scans:&#xD;
&#xD;
                [11C]Acetate PET/CT scan performed at baseline and at the time of clinical follow&#xD;
                up; 3 months for grade 2 glioma patients on standard follow up, 2-3 months after&#xD;
                treatment for patients being imaged pre- and post-treatment. The patient will be&#xD;
                positioned supine in the PET/CT scanner for a dynamic scan over the brain. Patients&#xD;
                will have two intravenous lines placed, one in each arm. [11C]Acetate PET/CT will&#xD;
                be performed using the standard dose of 0.3 mCi/kg up to a maximum of 30mCi for&#xD;
                [11C]Acetate. A single imaging field over the brain will be imaged dynamically for&#xD;
                30 min following the start of a 1-min intravenous infusion of [11C]Acetate, as&#xD;
                described in Section VI.F.2.&#xD;
&#xD;
                4. General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines Any adverse&#xD;
                effects, related or non-related to the injection of [11C]Acetate, will be treated&#xD;
                as clinically indicated with no study-related restrictions.&#xD;
&#xD;
                5. Duration of Therapy and Follow-up: This is an observational study and patients&#xD;
                will remain on study for the duration of their clinical follow up, as determined by&#xD;
                their treating physician. [11C]Acetate PET scan timing will be determined based on&#xD;
                their individual clinical course.&#xD;
