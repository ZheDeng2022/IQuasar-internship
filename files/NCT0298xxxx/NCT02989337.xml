      The purpose of the study is to determine serum inflammatory adhesion molecules levels in&#xD;
      hyperemesis gravidarum&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>

      The study population consisted of 2 groups; (1) the hyperemesis gravidarum group, consist of&#xD;
      25 pregnant women who developed dehydration due to HG between 6 and 13 gestational weeks and&#xD;
      between 18 and 35 years (2) the normal pregnancy group, consisting of 25 pregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HG was defined according to the fallowing American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists&#xD;
      (ACOG) criteria; severe nausea and vomiting resulted in 5% weight loss with regard to&#xD;
      pre-gestation or vomiting more than 3 times and 3-5 % weight loss with ketonuria. The&#xD;
      diagnosis of dehydration was clinically defined and patients with moderate and severe&#xD;
      dehydration were included in the study. As clinical findings; Weight loss, capillary recall&#xD;
      time, dry mucous membranes, dry eye, pulse rate, systolic blood pressure, respiration, skin&#xD;
      turgor deterioration and urine output were evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other pathologies causing nausea and vomiting like; gastroenteritis, gastroparesis, gall duct&#xD;
      diseases, hepatitis, peptic ulcers, appendicitis, pyelonephritis, ovarian torsion, urinary&#xD;
      tract stones, diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperthyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, migraine, pseudo&#xD;
      tumor cerebra, vestibular diseases were excluded from the study.Patients were excluded from&#xD;
      the study in the presence of pregestational diabetes chronic hypertension, chronic liver and&#xD;
      renal failure, preeclampsia history, multiple pregnancy, hyperlipidemia,&#xD;
      hypercholesterolemia, obesity, tobacco use, NSAID drug use, infection within the last three&#xD;
      months and surgery within the last month that could cause endothelial dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and urine specimens were collected from the patients with HG during hospitalization and&#xD;
      during regular clinic visits in control group. The 2mL of blood samples were withdrawn into&#xD;
      serum-separating tubes for the measurements of serum biochemical parameters and 2 mL blood&#xD;
      samples were withdrawn into EDTA containing tubes for measurement serum hemoglobin and&#xD;
      hematocrit levels. Early-morning urine samples were collected from study population. These&#xD;
      blood and urine samples were analyzed in same day for Kayseri Education and Research hospital&#xD;
      biochemical clinics. In addition 2mL of blood samples were withdrawn into serum-separating&#xD;
      tubes for analyzing serum sVEGFR-1, sVCAM-1, sE-selectin and sICAM-1 levels. All of the serum&#xD;
      were stored at -80°C in nonadsorbable tubes. After three months for stored first blood&#xD;
      sample, serum sVEGFR-1, sVCAM-1, sE-selectin and sICAM-1 levels were determined by an enzyme&#xD;
      linked immunosorbent assay.&#xD;
