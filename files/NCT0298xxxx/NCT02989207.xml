  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim is to perform a randomised feasibility trial preceding a large prospective randomised&#xD;
      controlled trial (RCT) comparing three surgical methods - trabeculectomy with Mitomycin C&#xD;
      (MMC), primary Baerveldt tube with MMC and Baerveldt tube without MMC - in black&#xD;
      African/African Caribbean patients with Primary Open Angle Glaucoma (POAG) living in London.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The UK Office of National Statistics estimated that among the population of England in 2007,&#xD;
      approximately 4.3% were of African/African-Caribbean background, while in large cities such&#xD;
      as London and Birmingham about 20% of the population is of African/African-Caribbean origin.&#xD;
      For eye units in these cities, managing glaucoma in this population is challenging and we&#xD;
      need to identify a better alternative to our current standard surgical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is now evidence from one RCT which shows better overall outcomes from tube surgery in&#xD;
      comparison to trabeculectomy for glaucoma. However, this study did not address black&#xD;
      populations specifically and did not address the potential role of MMC in tube surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This feasibility study will enable us to design a fully powered RCT with the aim of&#xD;
      determining how best to optimise the surgical treatment of POAG in black populations, by&#xD;
      comparing outcomes in three types of glaucoma surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An audit performed at St Thomas's Hospital in 2008 showed that 52 trabeculectomy and 50&#xD;
      Baerveldt tube procedures were done in one year, with 60% of the patients being of 'black'&#xD;
      ethnicity. This audit provides the basis for teh recruitment target. Assuming that the&#xD;
      majority of the trabeculectomies performed were for POAG then most of these 'black' patients&#xD;
      would have been eligible for the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Tube versus Trabeculectomy Study (PTVT) St Thomas' Hospital is the leading recruiting&#xD;
      centre for this multinational study. The investigators have recruited over 50 patients in the&#xD;
      last 2 years despite the lack of a dedicated research team. The trial retention rate has also&#xD;
      been very good with less than 5% loss to follow-up rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Feedback and Involvement The proposed research was reviewed in a feedback session in&#xD;
      2012 with 5 black African-Caribbean/African patients with glaucoma attending St Thomas'&#xD;
      Hospital. All were very positive about the potential trial and all understood that there is a&#xD;
      'unique' problem for glaucoma surgery in this group of patients. Suggestions for the trial&#xD;
      included more emphasis on the importance of treatment for glaucoma, disseminating information&#xD;
      about the trial in community centres, and the possibility of expert patients who can act as&#xD;
      patient advocates and help with recruitment in the glaucoma clinics and present the study in&#xD;
      local community centres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility study This protocol is for a randomised feasibility trial which will compare&#xD;
      standard treatment (trabeculectomy with MMC) with primary Baerveldt tube surgery with or&#xD;
      without MMC in black African/African-Caribbean patients with POAG living in London. The study&#xD;
      will look at the feasibility of recruitment for a proposed larger scale RCT and will also&#xD;
      help the investigators to refine the methodology for the proposed trial in terms of outcome&#xD;
      measures and analysis. It will also help the investigators to recruit a patient user group&#xD;
      for input into the conduct and monitoring of the main trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information the study will provide&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are conducting this feasibility study in order to get an estimate of the&#xD;
      likely recruitment rate for the main study and to collect information that will help the&#xD;
      investigators to refine the outcome measures for the main study and to allow a valid&#xD;
      calculation of the sample size needed for a definitive study to answer the primary research&#xD;
      question. The investigators will use questionnaires to gather data on patients' quality of&#xD;
      life for health economic analysis but it is also our hope that the questionnaires will give&#xD;
      the investigators information on the perspectives of patients, including their preferences.&#xD;
      This feasibility study will help the investigators to explore how they can gather useful&#xD;
      information on the patient perspective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The feasibility study will also inform their planning for the main trial and data management&#xD;
      and help them to develop their community engagement and recruitment strategies, including&#xD;
      theri strategy for publicising the trial and enhancing recruitment. In addition, the&#xD;
      investigators intend to use the feasibility study to recruit a patient representative group&#xD;
      for input into the conduct and monitoring of the proposed main study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks and benefits The potential risks and benefits for patients participating in the&#xD;
      feasibility study are similar to those for standard clinical care. All participants will have&#xD;
      been identified as in need of glaucoma drainage surgery. Both trabeculectomy (currently as&#xD;
      first line treatment) and Baerveldt tube surgery (currently as second line treatment) are in&#xD;
      routine use for the treatment of POAG. Evidence on the beneficial effect of MMC is equivocal.&#xD;
      First line treatment with Baerveldt tube surgery may be associated with less failure and&#xD;
      complications than first line treatment by trabeculectomy but there is as yet no definitive&#xD;
      evidence on this question that is specific to the population included in this study.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to understand the information sheet and give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Black African Caribbean or African (defined as a person having origins in any of the&#xD;
             black racial groups of Africa). The identification of African or African-Caribbean&#xD;
             ethnicity will be based on patients' self-reported ethnicity classification in their&#xD;
             NHS case notes. In our recent audit, almost 90% of the case notes had data on&#xD;
             patients' self-reported ethnicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 18 to 85 years, inclusive. Inclusion criteria for study eye&#xD;
&#xD;
        All of the criteria listed below must be present in the study eye in order for the patient&#xD;
        to be eligible for enrolment in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        • Glaucoma that is uncontrolled on tolerated medical therapy with IOP ≥18 mmHg and ≤40 mmHg&#xD;
        in the study eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
        • No previous incisional ocular surgery in the study eye except for: i) Clear corneal&#xD;
        phacoemulsification surgery. ii) Previous conjunctival sparing minimally invasive glaucoma&#xD;
        surgeries (MIGS) more than 6 months ago. This may include procedures that do not involve&#xD;
        the conjunctiva such as Hydrus Microstent, iStent and endoscopic cyclophotocoagulation&#xD;
        (ECP) laser.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The authors do not think it likely that pseudophakia will influence the outcomes but&#xD;
        randomisation will be stratified by lens status to ensure balance in the treatment arms.&#xD;
