    <textblock>
      Colonoscopy outcome is strictly related to the adenoma detection rate (ADR). An endoscopy&#xD;
      withdrawal time &gt;6min has been suggested to increase the ADR since it allows for thorough&#xD;
      evaluation of the several hidden areas of the colon. The FUSE, full spectrum endoscopy&#xD;
      system, has been demonstrated to reduce the rate of missed lesions due to its wide-angle&#xD;
      view. In the present study the authors evaluate the impact of WT on ADR for High Definition&#xD;
      Standard Endoscopes with just a single imager to the FUSE endoscope.&#xD;

      Introduction Colonoscopy outcome is strictly related to the adenoma detection rate. An&#xD;
      endoscopy withdrawal time &gt;6min has been suggested to increase the adenoma detection rate&#xD;
      since it allows for accurate evaluation of the several hidden areas of the colon. The FUSE&#xD;
      endoscope has been demonstrated also to reduce the rate of missed lesions due to its wide&#xD;
      angle view.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study to evaluate the impact on the adenoma detection rate either of the use of a&#xD;
      FUSE endoscope or of interventions directed at optimizing withdrawal time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      to assess the impact of different factors in influencing the withdrawal time&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods A prospective non-randomized observational single-center study involving consecutive&#xD;
      outpatients, aged 18-85 yr, undergoing colonoscopy with different indications. Previous&#xD;
      abdominal colon resection, obstruction, inadequate preparation and incomplete examination&#xD;
      were exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a 3-month period 4 expert endoscopists will performed 500 colonoscopies either with&#xD;
      standard endoscope or with FUSE without a dedicated withdrawal time protocol. Colonoscopy&#xD;
      withdrawal times will be measured without the endoscopists' knowledge of being monitored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During a subsequent 3-month period the same endoscopists will perform further 500&#xD;
      colonoscopies with standard and FUSE scopes using dedicated inspection techniques and a&#xD;
      minimum 6-minute withdrawal time. In this second phase withdrawal times will be again&#xD;
      measured, but endoscopists will be aware of being monitored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following parameters will be recorded:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographic and general characteristics&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Indications to colonoscopy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Colonoscopy findings&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of preparation: Boston scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time to reach the coecum&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Withdrawal time The adenoma detection rate and the mean adenomas per patients will be&#xD;
           calculated.&#xD;
