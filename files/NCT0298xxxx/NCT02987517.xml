      This study will use a comparative effectiveness design of two interventions known to reduce&#xD;
      running impacts. The study will be conducted at the Spaulding National Running Center. A&#xD;
      total of 40 male and female participants, between ages 18-50 years, running 10- 30 miles per&#xD;
      week will be recruited from the local running community. All potential subjects will be&#xD;
      cleared for physical activity using a Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PAR-Q) and&#xD;
      screened via high-speed video to determine their habitual footstrike pattern. Those who are&#xD;
      rearfoot strikers will be included and will then be randomized to either an increased cadence&#xD;
      (CAD) or a forefoot strike (FFS) intervention group. Standardized running shoes will be&#xD;
      provided to both groups for the duration of the study. All participants will attend 2&#xD;
      strength-training instruction sessions with a physical therapist prior to gait-retraining&#xD;
      intervention. They will be instructed to perform the learned exercises daily for 4 weeks to&#xD;
      prepare the body tissues for forces associated with new gait methods. Subjects will then&#xD;
      attend 8 gait-retraining sessions over 2-3 weeks. Sessions will be scheduled as two&#xD;
      sequential days of training followed by a day of rest. The gait retraining protocols will be&#xD;
      conducted on a treadmill. 3D Motion Capture analysis will be conducted at baseline and at 3&#xD;
      points following intervention (1 week, 1 month, and 6 months).&#xD;

      SUBJECT ENROLLMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
      When potential participants are contacted (or contact investigators), they will be screened&#xD;
      by phone or email to ensure they meet the study inclusion or exclusion criteria. If they do,&#xD;
      details of the study procedures will be explained and they will be given the opportunity to&#xD;
      ask questions and take as much time as required to decide if they would like to participate.&#xD;
      In addition, once consent is obtained, subjects will undergo an initial screening treadmill&#xD;
      run to ensure foot strike and cadence inclusion criteria are met.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the study begins, participants will be provided with a written consent form and be&#xD;
      given the opportunity to ask any further questions. Prior to initiation of initial screening,&#xD;
      data collection, or treatment, participants must sign the consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned via computer to one of two treatment conditions: 1)&#xD;
      increased cadence running gait or 2) forefoot strike running gait.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PROCEDURES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will have 13 visits to the Spaulding National Running Center for screening,&#xD;
      interventions, and biomechanical analyses. Each visit is outlined below: Visit 1 (2.5 hours)&#xD;
      determine if subject uses habitual heel strike and cadence less than or equal to 170, color&#xD;
      vision test measure subject's weight, height, leg length, and arch height Baseline&#xD;
      biomechanical analysis on instrumented treadmill Physical therapist-researcher will instruct&#xD;
      strengthening exercises for feet and legs Subjects told to perform exercises daily and keep&#xD;
      journal for 4 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2 (30 minutes) One week after exercise instruction, subjects meet with a&#xD;
      physical-therapist researcher to review and perform strengthening exercises and voice any&#xD;
      questions or concerns&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits 3-10 (1 hour each) Gait retraining on a treadmill using auditory feedback (metronome&#xD;
      for cadence or Noraxon system for forefoot strike) and verbal instruction from a physical&#xD;
      therapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These visits will be distributed over a 2-3 week time period. Subjects may run 2 days in a&#xD;
      row, but never 3 days in a row.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 11 (1 week after final gait retraining) (2 hours) Measure subject's resting heart rate,&#xD;
      weight, height, leg length, and arch height Biomechanical analysis of running gait on&#xD;
      instrumented treadmill Biomechanical analysis of running gait on instrumented treadmill until&#xD;
      either 85-90 percent of age predicted heart rate is reached or a Borg Rating of Perceived&#xD;
      Exertion score of greater than or equal to 17 is reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects instructed in use of REDCap secure web application for journal of running frequency&#xD;
      and distance (in miles), any discomfort or injuries that occur with running over the next 6&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 12 (1 month after final gait retraining) (2 hours)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measure subject's weight, height, leg length, and arch height Biomechanical analysis on&#xD;
      instrumented treadmill Remind subjects to continue to keep journal&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reminder via email or phone call Physical therapist-researcher will contact subjects 1 time&#xD;
      per month over the next 5 months to remind them to continue keeping journal of running&#xD;
      frequency and distance (in miles), and any discomfort or injuries that occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 13 (6 months after final gait retraining) (2 hours) Measure subject's weight, height,&#xD;
      leg length, and arch height Biomechanical analysis on instrumented treadmill&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcomes to be measured may include any combination of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Structural measures: Height, weight, leg length, arch height. Video analysis: Digital video&#xD;
      will only record the waist and below. Motion analysis: recording 3 dimensional movements&#xD;
      using a computerized system with reflective markers attached to the body and high-speed&#xD;
      cameras.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ground reaction forces: gathered through force sensing platforms embedded in the treadmill&#xD;
      Impact: an accelerometer attached to the body to record the impact experienced by the body&#xD;
      with each footstrike.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Devices to be used The data will be collected using 3D motion capture (Vicon Motion Systems)&#xD;
      in conjunction with 2 force plates (AMTI), which are embedded in the treadmill. Other devices&#xD;
      to be used are foot calipers for arch height, a digital metronome, and an accelerometer with&#xD;
      auditory feedback (Noraxon). These are all minimally invasive procedures that involve&#xD;
      attaching sensors or markers to the skin and recording the output from the sensor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      d) Procedures/interventions All study procedures will take place at the Spaulding National&#xD;
      Running Center in the Instrumented Treadmill Lab and clinic. Biomechanical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      All biomechanical analyses of running gait will take place in the Treadmill Lab using an&#xD;
      instrumented treadmill (AMTI) and a 3D motion analysis system. Four biomechanical analyses&#xD;
      will be conducted over the duration of this investigation. These will occur at baseline, 1&#xD;
      week after the final gait retraining session, 1 month following gait retraining, and 6 months&#xD;
      following gait retraining. Procedures for each analysis are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will run for a 3 minute warm up and be allowed to adjust to a speed of their&#xD;
      preference. An investigator will control treadmill speed, but both participant and&#xD;
      investigator can stop the treadmill at anytime via the emergency stop buttons. After warm up,&#xD;
      data collection will occur for 4000 frames (15-20 steps). To minimize or prevent any&#xD;
      laboratory performance effects, subjects will be distracted during data recording. The&#xD;
      distraction technique is based on the Stroop Color and Word Test, and involves subjects&#xD;
      reading aloud words on a screen directly in front of the treadmill. The correctness of the&#xD;
      test is of no interest; rather, it only serves as a distraction technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fatigue run One week after the final gait retraining session, subjects will be asked to run&#xD;
      until they feel fatigued. Fatigue will be defined as either of the following two criteria:&#xD;
      when the subject reaches 85-90 percent of age predicted heart rate max or when they report a&#xD;
      score greater than or equal to 17 on the Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion scale. Once&#xD;
      fatigue is reached, data will be collected for 4000 frames (15-20 steps).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strengthening exercises During the first visit, a physical-therapist investigator will&#xD;
      instruct subjects in strengthening exercises for the feet and legs. These activities will&#xD;
      prepare musculoskeletal tissues to adapt to new forces they will experience during gait&#xD;
      retraining. Subjects will be instructed to perform the exercises daily for 4 weeks, and will&#xD;
      be given a journal to record their exercise performance. One week after exercise instruction,&#xD;
      subjects will meet with the physical therapist-investigator to review the strengthening&#xD;
      exercises and report any questions or concerns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gait Retraining&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be 8 gait-retraining sessions over a 2-3 week time period. Subjects will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to either an increased cadence gait or a forefoot strike gait. The gait&#xD;
      retraining protocols will be conducted on a treadmill (Woodway) in the clinic of the&#xD;
      Spaulding National Running Center in the following manner:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increased cadence (CAD) Protocol: After a 3-minute warm up, subjects' preferred step rate&#xD;
      will be determined during their self-selected moderate intensity run for an additional 3&#xD;
      minutes using a visual count of footstrikes. Subjects will then be asked to increase their&#xD;
      normal cadence by 7.5 percent while maintaining their speed. This will be accomplished by&#xD;
      having subjects match their footstrikes to the beat of an audible digital metronome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forefoot strike (FFS) Protocol: Subjects will wear an accelerometer on the right anterior&#xD;
      distal tibial. After a 3-minute warm up run, subjects will continue running for an additional&#xD;
      3 minutes and a baseline rearfoot strike accelerometer value will be recorded. Next, subjects&#xD;
      will be instructed to land gently on the ball of their foot and lower their heels to the&#xD;
      ground. They will be guided with verbal cues and visual inspection from a physical therapist.&#xD;
      A forefoot strike accelerometer value will be recorded. If this value is exceeded, the device&#xD;
      will provide audible feedback when a heel strike is detected signaling the runner to land&#xD;
      with a FFS pattern.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For both groups, run time will be gradually increased from 10-30 minutes over 8 sessions. The&#xD;
      auditory feedback will be provided constantly for the first 4 sessions and then gradually&#xD;
      decreased in a systematic manner for the last four sessions. This feedback schedule has&#xD;
      produced successful outcomes in a number of gait retraining studies.4,5,6 The feedback&#xD;
      schedule for both groups is detailed as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session 1 - 10 minute treadmill run with metronome auditory feedback 100 percent of the time&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sessions 2,3,4 - Time of run will be gradually increased over sessions 2,3,4 to 12, 15, and&#xD;
      18 minutes respectively. Auditory feedback 100 percent of the time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sessions 5,6,7,8 - Time of run will be gradually increased over sessions 5,6,7,8 to 21,24,27,&#xD;
      and 30 minutes respectively. Auditory feedback will be gradually reduced and given only at&#xD;
      the beginning, middle, and end of a run.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be 4 minutes for sessions 5; 3 minutes for session 6; 2 minutes for session 7; and&#xD;
      1 minute for session 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be instructed not to run at any other time outside of the gait-retraining&#xD;
      period. After completion of gait retraining, subjects will be encouraged to continue their&#xD;
      new gait pattern as they run independently in the community. They will be instructed to&#xD;
      increase running distance by no greater than 10 percent per week until they reach their&#xD;
      desired running duration or distance. Subjects will be asked to keep journals of running&#xD;
      activity after gait retraining until they return for the final gait analysis. This will be&#xD;
      done via the REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) secure web application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data to be collected and when the data is to be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biomechanical outcomes as described above will be collected during each of the 5&#xD;
      biomechanical analyses that participants attend at the Spaulding National Running Center.&#xD;
      Every effort will be made to accommodate participants' schedules for these sessions. Data&#xD;
      collection will occur at the first visit (baseline), 1 week following gait retraining&#xD;
      (approximately 7 to 8 weeks from baseline), 1 month after gait retraining (approximately 11&#xD;
      weeks from baseline), and 6 months after gait retraining (approximately 35 weeks from&#xD;
      baseline).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Journals of daily strengthening exercise performance will be collected at Visit 3 (4 weeks&#xD;
      from baseline). Journals of running frequency and distance and any discomfort or injuries&#xD;
      will be collected throughout the 6 month follow up period using REDCap secure web application&#xD;
      (9 to 35 weeks from baseline).&#xD;
