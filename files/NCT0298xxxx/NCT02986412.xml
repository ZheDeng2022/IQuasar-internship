      We would suggest to conduct &quot;VOLUME-2&quot; study, as an extension of the ongoing &quot;VOLUME&quot; study&#xD;
      with all subjects already included. After completion of VOLUME study, the study will be&#xD;
      directly extend with an &quot;open-label design&quot;. All participants, who agreed to pursue, with&#xD;
      either &quot;Placebo&quot; or &quot;CG428&quot;, will receive CG428 treatment for an additional six-month period.&#xD;
      VOLUME-2 study would be ideal and timely by enabling no interruption of product use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Primary Objective is to observe for a longer period the efficacy of CG428 (12 months :&#xD;
      6months Volume + 6 months Volume-2) in order to better discriminate later or non-responder&#xD;
      populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives are :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate how far CG428 can improve hair-pattern (reach a plateau or constant&#xD;
           progression)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate motivation and adherence of subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Long term safety&#xD;

      The research team at Cancer Education Center at Samsung Comprehensive Cancer Center has&#xD;
      studied CIA and its impact on distress and psychosocial well-being since 2008. We found that&#xD;
      more than half of the breast cancer patients experienced higher distress due to CIA, during&#xD;
      cancer treatment, and this distress was strongly associated with negative body image, overall&#xD;
      health status, and psychosocial well-being. In a recent prospective cohort study, we assessed&#xD;
      skin and hair change patterns before, during and 6 months after chemotherapy in 61&#xD;
      volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We found that the majority of the patients still experienced CIA at 6 months after completion&#xD;
      of chemotherapy. Actually, hair diameter at 6th month after chemotherapy had not recovered to&#xD;
      baseline level. Permanent chemotherapy-induced alopecia, defined as absent or incomplete hair&#xD;
      regrowth at ≥6 months post-chemotherapy, was reported from 53 to 74%. Like CIA, permanent CIA&#xD;
      also lacks recognition and has been underserved regardless of patients' needs. The first&#xD;
      botanical blend Legacy Healthcare developed and patented is Cellium. Cellium is composed of 4&#xD;
      botanicals (Allium cepa L., Citrus limon L., Theobroma cacao L., Paullinia cupana).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first product derived from Cellium is a topical lotion for male and female alopecia,&#xD;
      CG210. Based on the safety and efficacy data, the EMA (European Medicines Agency) has&#xD;
      considered CG210 eligible for a European centralized herbal medicine registration. CG428 is&#xD;
      the second product derived from Cellium. CG428 contains the exact same ingredients as CG210,&#xD;
      in a different dosage. Legacy Healthcare have conducted a pilot studies with CG428 in Japan.&#xD;
      The trial included female cancer survivors experiencing permanent/persistent CIA for more&#xD;
      than 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the results, several cancer treatment centers in Japan have started to recommend the&#xD;
      product on a compassionate basis.We therefore hypothesize that the investigated topical&#xD;
      lotion may mitigate the impact of protracted or permanent CIA in cancer survivors by&#xD;
      restoring a normalized apoptotic process of hair follicular cells and reducing the acute, as&#xD;
      well as chronic inflammation in the scalp, two issues that may remain unsettled following&#xD;
      anticancer treatment. While considering the subjects included in the &quot;VOLUME&quot; study, it&#xD;
      appears that a majority of cancer survivors did not recover a full hair pattern even 3 years&#xD;
      after cancer treatment. This is per se an interesting data, and a new and significant&#xD;
      knowledge revealing that persistent chemotherapy induced apopecia (CIA) is more common than&#xD;
      anticipated.&#xD;

&#xD;
      The &quot;VOLUME&quot; study could have in fact two major repercussions: in addition to give&#xD;
      information on CG428 efficacy, it will help to better define persistent CIA and improve&#xD;
      thereby our scientific knowledge of this condition. Considering the high prevalence and poor&#xD;
      literature on persistent CIA, it appears important to study this condition further.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To this end, we would suggest to conduct &quot;VOLUME-2&quot; study, as an extension of the ongoing&#xD;
      &quot;VOLUME&quot; study with all subjects already included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to evaluation of Longer observation (12 months : 6months Volume + 6 months&#xD;
      Volume-2) permitting to better discriminate later or non-responder populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a open-label, single center, observation study in breast cancer survivors of VOLUME&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hair condition and parameters of 31 breast cancer survivors who were previously included in&#xD;
      VOLUME study (a randomized controlled trial to evaluate effect of CG428 which is topical hair&#xD;
      lotion for chemotherapy induced alopecia completed in December, 2016) will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participation du extension Volume-2 study will be proposed to patients during the last&#xD;
      visit of Volume study (Month 6)&#xD;
