  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to create a registry (collect data and keep it in a research&#xD;
      database) to learn more about two methods of taking small tissue samples from your esophagus&#xD;
      (the esophagus is the tube that carries food and liquid from your mouth to your stomach.).&#xD;
      The two methods of sampling are: 1) Using forceps that take biopsies (small tissue samples)&#xD;
      from your esophagus, and 2) Using a brush that also takes biopsies from your esophagus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By recording the results of all of your biopsies over many years, it may be possible to find&#xD;
      out if the brush biopsy, forceps biopsy, or both can predict which patients with heartburn&#xD;
      develop Barrett's esophagus, (an abnormality in the esophagus that may lead to cancer), and&#xD;
      which patients with Barrett's esophagus develop precancer and cancer. The data from your&#xD;
      biopsies will be used to determine the best way to diagnose esophageal disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You are being asked to participate in the study because you are receiving an upper endoscopy&#xD;
      (a procedure where a tube with a light and camera are inserted in your mouth and down your&#xD;
      throat) with forceps and brush biopsies of your esophagus as part of your standard clinical&#xD;
      care, and you are between the ages of 18 and 80.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Meet one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with heartburn or regurgitation undergoing a screening EGD, who undergo&#xD;
             WATS3D sampling and forceps biopsies for suspicion of BE, or&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known BE with or without dysplasia undergoing a surveillance EGD with&#xD;
             WATS3D biopsies and forceps biopsies, or&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have undergone endoscopic eradication therapy(including, but not limited&#xD;
             to endoscopic mucosal resection, endoscopic submucosal dissection, radiofrequency&#xD;
             ablation and/orcryoablation/spray cryotherapy)who are undergoing surveillance EGD&#xD;
             following the establishment of complete eradication of intestinal metaplasia (CEIM)&#xD;
             with accompanying WATS3D sampling and forceps biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients meeting any of the following criteria will be excluded from this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who on their enrollment endoscopy have a visible highly suspicious lesion,&#xD;
             such as a nodule or ulcer, (noted while undergoing endoscopy) that requires targeted&#xD;
             biopsy will be excluded from the study.Patients requiring a targeted biopsy on&#xD;
             follow-up endoscopies will be allowed to remain in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who do not undergo both biopsy forceps and WATS3D biopsy of the esophagus on&#xD;
             their initial evaluationfor routine care will be excluded from this study. Subsequent&#xD;
             endoscopicevaluation may include forceps biopsies alone, WATS3D biopsies alone, or&#xD;
             both forceps and WATS3D biopsies.&#xD;
