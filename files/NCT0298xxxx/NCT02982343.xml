  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Charcot Marie Tooth (CMT) is the most common inherited neuropathy. It affects the nerves of&#xD;
      the hands and feet first, slowly progressing towards the centre of the body. It causes&#xD;
      varying degrees of weakness and reduced feeling, usually affecting the feet and ankles first.&#xD;
      High incidence of falls and knock on effects in quality of life are common. This is a&#xD;
      lifelong condition which, though not life limiting, does not have a cure. Research into the&#xD;
      effect of balance rehabilitation in people with CMT has been limited to traditional&#xD;
      exercises, which do not address the complex nature of balance impairments in this condition.&#xD;
      Multi-sensory rehabilitation has proved beneficial in improving balance in people with&#xD;
      sensory neuropathy. Research shows that strengthening trunk muscles can improve balance in&#xD;
      older people. Trunk and muscles close to it are largely unaffected in people with CMT,&#xD;
      therefore these muscles could be strengthened in these patients. This study proposes to&#xD;
      assess the feasibility of multi-sensory balance training, strength training with a focus on&#xD;
      the trunk and muscles close to the trunk, and falls management education. This comprehensive&#xD;
      approach is reflective of a clinical physiotherapy programme. Though a life-long condition,&#xD;
      many people with CMT lead full lives. A home based programme is proposed to so that patients&#xD;
      can fit it into their lives without having to travel for treatment. Therapists will use&#xD;
      self-management principles within treatment. Measurements will be taken prior to and&#xD;
      following treatment including physical measures, questionnaires and interviews. The&#xD;
      physiotherapy interventions will be taught home and data collection will be at the National&#xD;
      Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, University College London Hospitals (UCLH).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A recent, unpublished focus group study of people with CMT found that they reported more&#xD;
      falls than healthy people. They reported problems walking on uneven surfaces, difficulty&#xD;
      getting off the floor and a necessity to consciously think about every step to avoid falling&#xD;
      while walking (GM Ramdharry et al., 2015). A retrospective survey of people with CMT found&#xD;
      that 89% of the 94 respondents reported falls to the ground. Half of them reported falling at&#xD;
      least once a month with 5% falling every day (Ramdharry et al., 2011). We have just completed&#xD;
      an exploratory study of factors predicting falls risk. Preliminary analysis of prospective&#xD;
      falls data for 32 people over 6 months showed that they fell a median of 4 times (range 0 -&#xD;
      54 falls) and functional balance performance may be predictive (Ramdharry et al., 2015). A&#xD;
      study of people with CMT1a found that sensory impairment increased visual dependence for a&#xD;
      static balance task (van der Linden et al., 2010). There has only been one small study of&#xD;
      balance training in people with CMT, comparing a novel rehabilitation device with more&#xD;
      traditional exercises (Matjacić and Zupan, 2006). Both interventions showed improvement in&#xD;
      functional balance scores. Studies of proximal strength training in CMT have shown&#xD;
      improvements in walking parameters (Chetlin et al., 2004; Lindeman et al., 1995), but the&#xD;
      effect on balance has not been explored. Because of the mixed sensori-motor presentation of&#xD;
      people with CMT, a combined approach of multi-sensory balance training and proximal&#xD;
      strengthening will be delivered. A home-based model has been proposed as CMT is a life-long&#xD;
      condition that needs to be managed by the individual outside of the medical or therapy&#xD;
      environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN &amp; JUSTIFICATION A single blinded randomised controlled design has been chosen in&#xD;
      this feasibility study. The intention is to see if there is an effect of the intervention to&#xD;
      later be explored in a larger randomized controlled trial. A blinded assessor will measure&#xD;
      balance performance prior to randomisation and following the 12 weeks of either intervention&#xD;
      or control. They will also undertake qualitative interviews prior to randomization and&#xD;
      following final measurement session. Interviews will inform the intervention and its&#xD;
      acceptability. All participants will receive a falls assessment and falls education.&#xD;
      Following randomisation, participants will either receive the 12-week intervention or control&#xD;
      period. The intervention will include a holistic programme of physiotherapy including&#xD;
      strength training of muscle groups unaffected by the condition and multi-sensory exercises to&#xD;
      target balance. The program will be delivered by a physiotherapist trained in delivering&#xD;
      treatment under the principles of self-management. Exercises will be carried out by the&#xD;
      patients in their own homes and monitored by the research physiotherapist, progressing as&#xD;
      appropriate. Those randomized to the control arm will receive monitoring telephone calls&#xD;
      throughout this 12-week period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RECRUITMENT Patients will be recruited from outpatient neurology clinics at Queen Square&#xD;
      which specialise in the diagnosis and management of CMT. Patients who fit the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria will be approached and the trial will be described to them. Written information will&#xD;
      be provided and arrangement made for a way to make contact once they have decided about&#xD;
      whether they wish to proceed with screening. All patients who agree to proceed will go&#xD;
      through a screening which will take place over the telephone. Those who pass screening will&#xD;
      be provided with falls diary postcards or arrangement for falls diary emails, which they will&#xD;
      be asked to monitor and report for one month. A sample will be invited for a qualitative&#xD;
      interview. Arrangement will be made for them to attend a baseline measurement session, falls&#xD;
      assessment, and falls education following the month-long falls monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient reported questionnaires of balance confidence, mood, walking ability and physical&#xD;
      functioning 10m walk test / 6 minute walk test Berg Balance Scale Bruininks Oseretsky Test&#xD;
      (BOT) BESTest Functional balance tests using force plate and movement analysis equipment&#xD;
      Strength testing of the lower limbs and hands Charcot Marie Tooth Examination Score (CMTES) A&#xD;
      block randomisation will occur following the baseline measurement and falls education session&#xD;
      with allocation either being to a control arm or an intervention arm. This will be done by&#xD;
      the PI or research physiotherapist who will remain un-blinded. Contact with the blinded&#xD;
      assessor will cease until the final measurement session 12 weeks later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If randomised to the control arm of the study, participants will be advised that the research&#xD;
      physiotherapist will contact them monthly to monitor any falls or issues. For those&#xD;
      randomised to the intervention arm, a home visit will be arranged with the research&#xD;
      physiotherapist as soon as possible. During this session, the research physiotherapist will&#xD;
      provide the participant with exercises to strengthen the muscles of the trunk and proximal&#xD;
      muscles using body weight and graded ankle weights. Strength training will be performed 4&#xD;
      times per week. They will also give a selection of exercises targeting balance to challenge&#xD;
      stability and sensory feedback. Participants will be asked to perform balance exercises&#xD;
      daily. A risk assessment will be undertaken with guidance on how to ensure safety when doing&#xD;
      the exercises. An exercise diary will be provided for the participants to monitor exercise&#xD;
      frequency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arrangements will be made for weekly telephone calls with the research physiotherapist to&#xD;
      monitor progress and a provisional date set for the first monthly home monitoring visit.&#xD;
      Participants in the intervention arm will be contacted weekly for 12 weeks on the study. The&#xD;
      research physiotherapist will visit them at home to monitor and progress exercises once a&#xD;
      month during this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      QUALITATIVE RESEARCH At the consent meeting all patients will be invited to take part in&#xD;
      interviews conducted after the consent meeting and following completion of the final&#xD;
      measurements. They will be made aware that participation in the interviews is supplementary&#xD;
      to the main study and they are free to decline. Purposive sampling will be used to ensure a&#xD;
      sample of maximum diversity of age, gender, and symptom severity. Potential qualitative&#xD;
      interview participants will be given written details of the qualitative study and asked to&#xD;
      give their consent to be interviewed if they are willing to take part. The interview will be&#xD;
      audio recorded and consist of a dialogue between the interviewer (the researcher) and the&#xD;
      participant. A topic guide will be used during the interviews, but the participant will be&#xD;
      invited to raise issues of importance to them. Data analysis will be iterative, in that it&#xD;
      will be continually analysed throughout the data collection process and used to inform&#xD;
      following interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROCEDURES TO DEAL WITH RESEARCHER EFFECTS AND BIAS Assessments will be carried out by a&#xD;
      blinded assessor to standardise treatment during tests. Falls assessment and falls education&#xD;
      will be provided at the baseline measurement session by the blinded assessor, prior to&#xD;
      participant randomisation. In this way participants will be given the same treatment. The&#xD;
      blinded assessor will perform final measurements. The participant will be reminded prior to&#xD;
      the start the final session to not mention what they may or may not have been doing in the 12&#xD;
      weeks prior to maintain blinding throughout the session&#xD;
