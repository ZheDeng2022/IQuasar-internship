  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the perception of the effectiveness of Hidrafemme® gels, Vagidrat®, Lubrinat and&#xD;
      Antrofi cream in improving vaginal moisture in postmenopausal women who are currently&#xD;
      registered options most current and available in the market in order to assess the&#xD;
      differences between them, subsequently conduct a clinical study larger.&#xD;

      Before any procedure of the study, the researcher should have undertaken a detailed&#xD;
      discussion on the Consent and Informed remedying any questions the patient may present. Then&#xD;
      the principal investigator and the patient must sign all pages of the Consent and Informed&#xD;
      (two-way), each one with a copy. Female patients aged above 40 years postmenopausal and who&#xD;
      are diagnosed with vaginal dryness, will be invited to participate in this study. After the&#xD;
      selection, through the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and signing the consent form&#xD;
      Clarified, research participants will be evaluated by clinical examination (VHI), pH&#xD;
      evaluation (using pH tape), questionnaire application IFSF and subjective evaluation of the&#xD;
      patient. All the above procedures will be performed in own research center for the study&#xD;
      team. The study in question has four (4) treatment groups with fourteen (14) patients each,&#xD;
      totaling fifty-six (56) patients. The allocation of these patients will occur blind, parallel&#xD;
      to the first group use the Hidrafemme, the second uses the Vagidrat, uses the third and&#xD;
      fourth Lubrinat use the Antrofi. All groups conduct the use of those products, twice a week&#xD;
      for four (4) consecutive weeks. After the addition, the research participant will receive the&#xD;
      product under study and will be oriented as their dosage, correct application form and the&#xD;
      records in the patient diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the Visit 1 (initial) the research participant must return for another visit in person,&#xD;
      Visit 2 (final), the research center, which will take place 28 calendar days after the date&#xD;
      of Visit 1 (initial). During all the above visits, the participants research will be assessed&#xD;
      by the principal investigator and will be conducted the subjective evaluation of the patient,&#xD;
      VHI evaluation (attached), pH control and will fill the IFSF form (attached). At the final&#xD;
      visit will be also evaluated the acceptability of the product and adherence to treatment&#xD;
      through the patient diary. The adverse event occurrences will be evaluated during the final&#xD;
      visit. If any research participant submit an adverse event, it will be accompanied by&#xD;
      research center staff to its resolution. The variables related to the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      product will be studied by VHI scale, which indicates the score of each item under study. The&#xD;
      score should be evaluated for each variable. Daily application for registration throughout&#xD;
      the period of four (4) weeks, and the product will be dispensed after the inclusion /&#xD;
      randomization of the patient during the initial visit, sufficient to twenty-eight (28) days&#xD;
      of treatment.&#xD;

    <description>The efficacy parameter: intensity of vaginal moisture; It will be measured by the VHI: 1 = no / inflamed surface; 2 = no / not inflamed surface; 3 = minimal, 4 = moderate, 5 = Normal. They will be described by mean and standard deviation or median and interquartile range, as well as minimum and maximum. If there is a normal distribution and equal variance will be held the Split-Plot ANOVA measures and where there are significant differences will be a post hoc Tukey and Dunnet. 95% confidence intervals for the mean difference will be calculated</description>
