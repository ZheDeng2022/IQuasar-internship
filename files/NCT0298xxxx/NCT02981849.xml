      The purpose of this study is to address the needs for efficient and informative measurement&#xD;
      for evaluating adolescent Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT)&#xD;
      strategies. The investigators will undertake a longitudinal cohort study to build and&#xD;
      validate a substance specific measurement battery that includes patient-centered and&#xD;
      intermediary outcomes which can be integrated into a range of healthcare and research&#xD;
      settings. The results of this project will enable evaluation of SBIRT trials and clinical&#xD;
      efforts by validating a parsimonious set of measurement tools that can be incorporated into&#xD;
      electronic health records. The primary goal of the proposed project is to develop a set of&#xD;
      brief, valid tools that will allow both researchers and clinicians to collect information&#xD;
      that enables evaluating and refining brief interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to define and disseminate a set of brief and easy to administer&#xD;
      measures that accurately detect 1) substance use frequency, 2) substance-specific patient&#xD;
      centered outcomes and 3) intermediate measures of impact of adolescent SBIRT. The specific&#xD;
      aim addressed in this project is to develop and administer an assessment battery that&#xD;
      includes novel questions assessing substance use to be validated against criterion standard&#xD;
      measures both cross-sectionally and longitudinally.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A policy level mandate now exists to deliver screening, brief intervention, and referral to&#xD;
      treatment (SBIRT) to all adolescents in primary care. This mandate is spurred by the&#xD;
      imperative to reduce the enormous and preventable morbidity and mortality caused by&#xD;
      adolescent substance use. Despite this mandate and the opportunity to reach large cohorts of&#xD;
      youth early within primary and specialty pediatric care, SBIRT is not routinely delivered nor&#xD;
      used in ways that optimize outcomes. The National Institute on Drug Abuse, National Institute&#xD;
      on Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse, the Substance Use and Mental Health Services Administration&#xD;
      and the Hilton Foundation have all included adolescent SBIRT in their research, training and&#xD;
      service project portfolios. Lacking validated measures that can be used to assess impacts and&#xD;
      guide early action, opportunities to glean the most effective strategies and components of&#xD;
      brief interventions are hampered despite these considerable investments. This threatens the&#xD;
      relevance and sustainability of this work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address the needs for efficient and informative measurement for evaluating adolescent&#xD;
      Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) strategies, the&#xD;
      investigators will undertake a longitudinal cohort study to build and validate a substance&#xD;
      specific measurement battery that includes patient-centered and intermediary outcomes which&#xD;
      can be integrated into a range of healthcare and research settings. This is a construct&#xD;
      validity study in which the investigators will be interested in seeing whether a brief set of&#xD;
      questions will accurately measure substance use when compared to lengthy gold standard&#xD;
      measures. This is also a predictive validity study, in which the investigators are interested&#xD;
      in seeing whether proposed patient-centered and intermediary outcomes are relevant in&#xD;
      predicting future substance use risk or patterns of use. The results of this project will&#xD;
      enable evaluation of SBIRT trials and clinical efforts by validating a parsimonious set of&#xD;
      measurement tools that can be incorporated into electronic health records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project is one component of a two part study in which the investigators will enroll a&#xD;
      total of 900 adolescents. The investigators will enroll a total of 450 participants from the&#xD;
      Adolescent/Young Adult Medical Clinic for this study and will attempt to follow participant&#xD;
      for one year. Accounting for attrition at 6 months and 12 months follow-up, the investigators&#xD;
      expect 300 participants will complete the entire study.&#xD;
