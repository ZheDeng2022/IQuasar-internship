  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will perform a diagnostic accuracy study comparing tracheal breath sound&#xD;
      recordings in awake individuals to the STOP-Bang screening questionnaire, using the&#xD;
      apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) score determined by polysomnography as the gold standard.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a breathing disorder with numerous health effects including&#xD;
      a greater risk of peri-operative anesthetic complications. Numerous screening tools exist but&#xD;
      are not without limitations. Diagnostic overnight sleep studies are resource-intensive and&#xD;
      difficult to obtain in the short time period between pre-operative clinic assessment and the&#xD;
      day of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project aims to test the diagnostic performance of a new screening technology,&#xD;
      Awake-OSA, for screening of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). &quot;Awake-OSA&quot; uses a small external&#xD;
      microphone placed on the neck, to record and analyze tracheal breath sounds at the bedside&#xD;
      while the patient is awake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using polysomnography (PSG) as a gold standard, the investigators will compare Awake-OSA&#xD;
      (breath sound recording) and the STOP-Bang screening questionnaire in their ability to&#xD;
      accurately identify patients with OSA, as well as classify OSA in terms of severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early, point-of-care diagnosis has the potential to provide a low-cost, convenient&#xD;
      alternative to traditional screening questionnaires and enable more selective use of PSG. Our&#xD;
      goal is to improve peri-operative patient safety while improving use of resources and&#xD;
      streamlining patient care.&#xD;
