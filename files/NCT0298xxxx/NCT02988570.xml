  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, several studies confirm that some of preterm children have language&#xD;
      developmental disabilities, in production, in comprehension, or in written language. These&#xD;
      language impairments lead to learning disabilities. There are, however, contradictions&#xD;
      concerning the origin and nature of language dysfunctions. Some studies find lexical&#xD;
      disorders (number of words used by the child), others preferentially phonological disorders&#xD;
      (sounds used in the language), others also disorders of the morphosyntaxe (organization of&#xD;
      the sentences) and fragilities that affect pragmatics (understanding situations).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The computer-evaluation of the language is carried out at five and a half year coupled with&#xD;
      the medical and neuropsychological examinations. The language assessment lasts 30 to 45&#xD;
      minutes per child. It is carried out using a laptop computer that allows the submission of&#xD;
      stimuli and recording of the child's responses. The language evaluation scale is the battery&#xD;
      CléA (Pasquet F et al, 2014), standardized reference tool for the realization of a language&#xD;
      evaluation. The assessment includes three tests: comprehension of words and phrases,&#xD;
      production of words and phrases, and judgment of sentences. Each time, the child sees images&#xD;
      and hears words or phrases. Sometimes he has to say what he sees on the computer screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As usual, a speech-language assessment is not carried out, routinely, at the age of 5 years&#xD;
      in the context of the follow-up of children born very preterm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation proposed to the child in this research will be carried out at a significant&#xD;
      period of development, before writing. This assessment will not only assess the structure of&#xD;
      the child's language, but also determine if there are possible difficulties in learning to&#xD;
      read and write.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected benefits for the health of the children included in the trial therefore concern&#xD;
      the detection or characterization of any developmental fragilities affecting the language.&#xD;
      These screenings or characterizations will make it possible to advocate a speech&#xD;
      rehabilitation if necessary.&#xD;
