      Prospective open-label, uncontrolled clinical study to assess the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      autologous cultured epidermal grafts containing epidermal stem cells genetically modified&#xD;
      with the aid of a gamma-retroviral vector carrying COL7A1 complementary DNA (cDNA) for&#xD;
      restoration of the epidermis in patients with recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to demonstrate the safety and efficacy after one or more treatments&#xD;
      with genetically corrected cultured epidermal autograft (Hologene 7) in patients suffering of&#xD;
      recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) with COL7A1 mutation.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a monocentric, prospective, open label, uncontrolled clinical trial, phase I/II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be screened according to the Study Inclusion and Exclusion criteria and will be&#xD;
      candidate for the treatment if all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria are met.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After confirmation of eligibility, patients will undergo biopsy for the collection of the&#xD;
      autologous epidermal cells to be used to produce the tissue for the treatment. In case all&#xD;
      criteria are met, the transplantation of the new cultured transgenic epidermis will be&#xD;
      planned according to the procedures and the need of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study treatment consists of a surgical intervention for new restored stem cells&#xD;
      implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgery will be carried out in 2 stages, the first aims at taking biopsy to isolate&#xD;
      epidermal cells including stem cells. The biopsy will be processed in a laboratory of a&#xD;
      regenerative medicine manufacturing site where they will be corrected, expanded and prepared&#xD;
      as final sheets to be implanted. Therefore, the patient can have his second intervention. In&#xD;
      this second surgery, genetically corrected cultured epidermal autograft (Hologene 7) will be&#xD;
      implanted into the selected area. The specialist surgeon will either use a local or general&#xD;
      anaesthetic for the implant operation. The treated area will be immobilized for some days&#xD;
      after this operation. Antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs will be administered (if&#xD;
      necessary) to prevent infections and to minimise swelling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three months after the transplantation, primary endpoint will be evaluated by the&#xD;
      Investigator. The study completion will be reached when 1 year (secondary endpoint) of&#xD;
      follow-up after the last transplant in the last patient will be accomplished.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The end of the trial is defined as the last visit of the last patient after the last&#xD;
      treatment if any.&#xD;

    <description>Genetically corrected cultured epidermal autograft (Hologene 7) is intended for transplantation onto surgically prepared blistering skin areas of RDEB patients and permanent regeneration of a healthy, functional and renewing epidermis sustained by the engraftment of transduced epidermal stem cells.&#xD;
By taking some autologous epidermal cells, a new layer of transgenic tissue is grown in the laboratory. This layer of tissue is then implanted by a surgeon into the damaged area. The implantation can be done in one or more areas and repeated in case of failure of the first surgery.</description>
