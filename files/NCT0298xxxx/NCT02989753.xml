  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed as a pilot study in order to estimate the effect of VAL070-A and&#xD;
      VAL070-B products and their variability on LDL cholesterol and lipid metabolism since these&#xD;
      data are still unknown for these products and in this specific population. Collected data&#xD;
      will provide more reliable information which may be used to plan a subsequent larger main&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

      Main objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the present trial is to assess the beneficial effect of VAL070-B&#xD;
      compared to a placebo, on blood LDL cholesterol level in moderate hypercholesterolemic and&#xD;
      hypertriglyceridemic subjects after 12 weeks of consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives of the study are to assess the effects of VAL070-A and VAL070-B,&#xD;
      compared to a placebo and to each other, in moderate hypercholesterolemic and&#xD;
      hypertriglyceridemic subjects after 12 weeks if consumption through the following parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood level of LDL cholesterol (VAL070-A compared to placebo and VAL070-A compared to&#xD;
           VAL070-B),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lipid profile: Blood levels of triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and&#xD;
           non- HDL cholesterol,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Glycaemia,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood hsCRP,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fructosamine,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood total free fatty acid levels,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anthropometrics assessed by body weight (BW), waist circumference (WC), hip&#xD;
           circumference (HC) and waist to hip ratio (WHR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following parameters, analyzed at baseline and after 12 weeks of consumption,&#xD;
      participated to the safety objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood levels of urea and creatinine,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood levels of GGT, AST and ALT,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete blood count,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hemodynamic measurements: heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic&#xD;
           blood pressure (DBP),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse events.&#xD;
