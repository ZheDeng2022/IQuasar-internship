      Background: Platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) and bioactive glass putty has been shown to be&#xD;
      effective in promoting reduction in probing depth, gain in clinical attachment, and defect&#xD;
      fill in intrabony periodontal defects. The individual role played by bioactive glass putty in&#xD;
      combination with PRF is yet to be elucidated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM: To compare the clinical effectiveness of the combination of Plaltelet Rich Fibrin and&#xD;
      Bioactive Glass Putty and Bioactive glass putty regenerative techniques for intrabony defects&#xD;
      in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and methods: Ten pairs of intrabony defects were surgically treated with PRF and&#xD;
      Bioactive glass putty (Test group) on one side or bioactive glass putty (Control group) on&#xD;
      other side. The primary outcomes of the study included changes in probing depth, attachment&#xD;
      level and bone fill of Osseous defect. The clinical parameters were recorded at baseline, 3,&#xD;
      6, and 9 months. Radiographic assessment was done using standardized intra oral periapical&#xD;
      radiographs. Comparisions were made within each group between baseline, 3 months, 6 months&#xD;
      and 9 months using the ANOVA test followed by Bonferroni test.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periodontitis is an infectious disease that causes destruction of the attachment&#xD;
      apparatus.[1].The mainstay aim of periodontal treatment is the regeneration of the lost&#xD;
      attachment apparatus of the teeth. Variety of treatment modalities are available for&#xD;
      periodontal regenerative therapy including bone grafts, bone substitutes, Guided Tissue&#xD;
      Regeneration, growth factors, application of tissue engineering or the combination of two or&#xD;
      more of the above listed approaches. [2] Alloplasts, may be an effective alternative to&#xD;
      allograft and xenografts as there is no risk of disease transmission and the supply is&#xD;
      unlimited.[3] The Bioactive glass promotes osteogenesis by adsorption and concentrations of&#xD;
      protein utilized by osteoblast to form a mineralized extracellular matrix. [4] The advantage&#xD;
      of the putty form of bioactive glass is the glycerine and polyethylene glycol which makes the&#xD;
      glass particle coherent and thus enhancing handling characteristics and minimal migration of&#xD;
      graft particles from the defect site. [5] Histological evaluation of material has shown that&#xD;
      the particulate tends to retard the down growth of epithelial tissue. [6,7,8,9] Growth&#xD;
      factors play a pivotal role in periodontal regeneration. Platelet Rich Fibrin is believed to&#xD;
      release polypeptide growth factors, such as transforming growth factors-ÃŸ, platelet derived&#xD;
      growth factors, vascular endothelial growth factors and matrix glycoproteins (such as&#xD;
      thrombospondin -1) into the surgical wound in a sustained fashion for at least 7 days as&#xD;
      shown in vitro. [10] Thus, given the unique graft with osteoconductive, osteoinductive and&#xD;
      osteostimulative properties and properties of autologous PRF, application of combination&#xD;
      approach was attempted for the assessment of their additional benefits to the healing&#xD;
      mechanisms and periodontal regeneration in intrabony defects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods Patient Selection This randomized control trial was carried out in the&#xD;
      Department of Periodontics and Oral Implantology, Santosh Dental College and Hospital,&#xD;
      Santosh University, Ghaziabad. Ten patients suffering chronic localized periodontitis aged&#xD;
      between 20 -50 years (7 males and 3 females) with 10 pairs of contalateral intraosseous&#xD;
      defects (n=20) comprised the study population. A total of 20 bone defects (10 pairs) were&#xD;
      decided by the statisticion to be of statistical strength. Convenient sampling design was&#xD;
      used for the enrolment of study patients. Ethical approval was taken from the institutional&#xD;
      ethical committee The patients were explained in detail about the procedure and a written&#xD;
      informed consent was taken. The intrabony defects were diagnosed clinically with moderate to&#xD;
      deep periodontal pockets &gt; or = 5mm and with clinical and radiographic evidence of&#xD;
      vertical/angular osseous defects. [3] Patients with systemic diseases, on anticoagulants,&#xD;
      those with habit of smoking and alcohol, with known history of allergy to graft material and&#xD;
      who have undergone periodontal surgical treatment for chronic periodontitis within twelve&#xD;
      months for the same defects were excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRESURGICAL THERAPY Patients underwent phase I therapy. The selected defects were evaluated&#xD;
      after 2 weeks, and persistent pockets &gt; or = 5mm and patients with clinical radiographic&#xD;
      evidence of angular osseous defects were scheduled for surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Parameters :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral hygiene status was recorded using the gingival index of Loe &amp; Sillness,[11];&#xD;
&#xD;
      with score 0 indicating absence of inflammation and score 3 indicating severe&#xD;
&#xD;
      inflammation and plaque index of Silness &amp; Loe. [12]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Probing pocket depth and Clinical attachment level were recorded at baseline on the&#xD;
&#xD;
      day of surgery, 3, 6 and 9 months intervals using UNC-15 probe and customized&#xD;
&#xD;
      acrylic occlusal stents grooved in the area of defect to provide reproducible insertion&#xD;
&#xD;
      axis-&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following measurements were recorded with customized&#xD;
&#xD;
      acrylic stent:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fixed reference point (FRP) to the base of pocket (BP)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fixed reference point (FRP) to the cemento-enamel junction (CEJ)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fixed reference point (FRP) to the gingival margin (GM)&#xD;
&#xD;
      PPD and CAL were calculated from these probing measurements as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PPD = (FRP to BP) - (FRP to GM)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CAL= (FRP to BP) - (FRP to CEJ)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiographic measurements: Standardized intra-oral periapical radiographs of the defects were&#xD;
      taken using a paralleling technique.[13]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amount of defect fill: Defects were measured from the fixed reference point (distance between&#xD;
      the cemento-enamel junction to the radiographic base of the bone defect ) with the help of&#xD;
      1.1 mm grid and the following radiographic features were recorded on the day of surgery, 3, 6&#xD;
      and 9 months intervals.&#xD;
