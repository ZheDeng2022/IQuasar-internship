  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Synopsis: In most countries, there is an increase in the number of parents who refuse some,&#xD;
      most or all vaccines or who adopt delayed vaccination schedule. Vaccine hesitancy (VH) is a&#xD;
      global phenomenon that needs to be measured and addressed. However, to this date, no&#xD;
      effective strategy has been identified. Dr Gagneur have developed and validated a new&#xD;
      approach to educate parents of newborns about vaccination, based on motivational interviewing&#xD;
      (MI) techniques. MI is a method to elicit and strengthen motivation for change based on the&#xD;
      person's own arguments for change that has been shown effective for the adoption of many&#xD;
      preventive health behaviors. This approach has been validated for vaccination during a pilot&#xD;
      study as well as in a provincial RCT in Quebec. Now that a proof of concept has been made in&#xD;
      Quebec, the investigators will validate the approach in other contexts (e.g. English-speaking&#xD;
      provinces and settings with different ways to deliver maternity care and childhood vaccines).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: An educational strategy, based on MI techniques, delivered in the maternity ward&#xD;
      increases parents' intention to vaccinate their infant, reduces VH scores and increases&#xD;
      infants' vaccine uptake in Quebec. This approach may be applicable across the country in&#xD;
      order to tackle VH and thus improve infants' vaccine coverage (VC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To evaluate the impact of the MI intervention on parents' intention to vaccinate&#xD;
      their child and their VH score and on infants' VC at 3 months of age, in a pan-Canadian&#xD;
      context.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Multicentre RCT in maternity wards of 5 provinces (QC, BC, ON, NS/PE). Parents will&#xD;
      be randomized to receive the MI intervention (intervention group) or to receive an&#xD;
      information flyer on vaccines (control group). MI intervention will be delivered by research&#xD;
      assistant that will have first received a standardized training session on the content and&#xD;
      techniques of MI. Parents will complete a self-administered questionnaire to measure&#xD;
      knowledge and vaccination intention as well as VH before and after the intervention.&#xD;
      Immunization data will be collected through an online questionnaire sent when the child will&#xD;
      reach 3 months of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected benefits: The strategy will be validated across different immunization programs from&#xD;
      5 Canadian provinces to take account of the differences in logistics and cultural contexts.&#xD;
      Results from this study will provide to the provincial and national public health authorities&#xD;
      an effective strategy to tackle VH.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objective: To evaluate the impact of the motivational interviewing (MI) intervention on&#xD;
      parents' intention to vaccinate their infant and their vaccine hesitancy (VH) score in a&#xD;
      Pan-Canadian context. In order to explore differences in the intervention's impact according&#xD;
      to cultural and organizational factors, all analysis will also be conducted at the level of&#xD;
      each center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess parents' intention to vaccinate their infant before the intervention and&#xD;
           immediately after the intervention, globally and at each center level.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess parents' VH scores before the intervention, immediately after the intervention&#xD;
           and when their infant is 3 months of age, globally and at each center level.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess parents' knowledge, attitudes and beliefs (KAB) about vaccination before the&#xD;
           intervention, immediately after the intervention and when their infant is 3 months of&#xD;
           age:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Descriptive analysis according to a composite model inspired from the Health Belief&#xD;
                Model (HBM), the Theory of Planned Behavior, and the VH measures (based on a&#xD;
                validated questionnaire);&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Research of the determinants of vaccination intention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To compare vaccine coverage (VC) at 3 months of age of infants whose parents has&#xD;
           received (intervention group) or not (control group) the intervention in the maternity&#xD;
           ward during the recruitment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a multicentre randomized controlled trial (RCT) with single unit of&#xD;
      randomization that will be conducted in maternity wards of 5 provinces: Quebec (QC), British&#xD;
      Columbia (BC), Ontario (ON), and Nova Scotia (NS)/ Prince Edward Island (PEI). In each&#xD;
      center, parents will be randomized to receive the MI intervention (intervention group) or to&#xD;
      receive an information flyer on childhood vaccines (control group). The flyer that will be&#xD;
      given to mothers of the control group will be the one that is usually given to parents at the&#xD;
      maternity ward or at the first home visit after birth during the first week. Thus, flyers&#xD;
      will be different according to the participating regions in this study. Randomization will be&#xD;
      stratified by center and will be made in blocks of 4, 6 and 8 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will include 1,600 mothers of infants born in the participating&#xD;
      maternity wards during the recruitment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study centers&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in 6 maternity wards located in 4 different centers:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Centre hospitalier universitaire de Sherbrooke (CHUS), Sherbrooke, QC;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. B.C. Women's Hospital &amp; Health Centre, Vancouver, BC and Surrey Memorial Hospital,&#xD;
           Surrey, BC;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. North York General Hospital, Toronto, ON;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. IWK Health Centre, Halifax, NS and Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Charlottetown, PE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The choice of these 6 maternity wards is the best compromise between the study feasibility&#xD;
      and the diversity of the Canadian population. More than 2,500 deliveries per year occur in&#xD;
      each maternity ward (except for Queen Elizabeth Hospital with approximately 1200 annual&#xD;
      births), which ensures the feasibility of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONDUCT OF STUDY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject must participate in the informed consent process and sign and date the informed&#xD;
      consent form before any procedures specified in this protocol are performed. Mothers&#xD;
      attending the participant maternity wards will be entirely free to participate in the study.&#xD;
      Benefits of the study will be the chance for the parents to discuss childhood immunizations&#xD;
      in a non-confronting and non-judgemental climate and the improvement of their knowledge.&#xD;
      Participation in the study will not involve risk, besides the risk of breach of&#xD;
      confidentiality for which precautions will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regulatory considerations&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be registered with ClinicalTrials.gov.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mothers will be approached to participate during the postpartum stay at the maternity ward.&#xD;
      The MI intervention will be delivered by a research assistant (RA) (or a research nurse) that&#xD;
      will have first received a standardized training session on the content and techniques of MI.&#xD;
      Since the postpartum stay may last less than 24 hours in some provinces, RAs will recruit&#xD;
      mothers in a chronological way according to the birth time of the mother to ensure to meet&#xD;
      the highest number of mothers as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recruitment will be conducted during 4 to 6 months. In the Quebec RCT, 25 participants&#xD;
      were recruited in average each week, so it is feasible to recruit 400 participants within 4&#xD;
      to 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the mothers agree to participate, they will have to complete an initial questionnaire&#xD;
      (Q1) to assess their intention to vaccinate, their VH scores and their KAB about vaccination,&#xD;
      as well as their socio-demographics characteristics. RAs will collect this questionnaire and&#xD;
      proceed to the randomization of the participating mother to receive the MI intervention or to&#xD;
      receive a flyer on childhood immunizations. Depending on the randomization result, RAs will&#xD;
      perform the MI intervention with the parents or only give the information flyer. RAs will&#xD;
      then distribute a similar questionnaire (Q2) to parents of both groups to assess their&#xD;
      intention to vaccinate, their VH scores and their KAB about vaccination, as well as their&#xD;
      satisfaction of the intervention received (MI or flyer). Before leaving the maternity ward,&#xD;
      parents will have to return their completed questionnaire to the RA or in a designated place.&#xD;
      When the child is 3 months of age, an online survey (Q3) will be sent to participants by&#xD;
      email to assess their VH score and their KAB as well as the child's vaccine status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standardization of the intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      To ensure that the content of the information sessions will be standardized and similar for&#xD;
      each center or RA, a reference document on the primary vaccination (vaccines administered&#xD;
      before the age of 1 year) will be made according to the provincial recommendations for each&#xD;
      center and will be used for the training of RAs. This training will be conducted over 3 days&#xD;
      including supervision via audio recordings (2 days + 1 day). First, RAs will participate in a&#xD;
      2-day centralized training seminar in Montreal on the MI techniques given by a certified&#xD;
      trainer before the beginning of the study. Subsequently, RAs will practice their MI skills&#xD;
      during a 4 to 6-week trial period in their respective maternity ward. During this time, RAs&#xD;
      will send an online audio recording of their MI intervention with a mother in the maternity&#xD;
      ward (a separate informed consent form will be signed by these mothers to authorize the&#xD;
      record and the sending of the MI intervention). The audio recordings will be securely&#xD;
      transferred to the certified MI trainer through a web-based application named REDCap&#xD;
      (Research Electronic Data Capture). Based on this recording, the certified MI trainer will&#xD;
      assess their MI skills and offer them support and feedback to improve their practice. After 6&#xD;
      weeks of trial, the study coordinator and the certified MI trainer will visit each center to&#xD;
      give individual feedback and coaching to each RA. They will observe and validate the MI&#xD;
      intervention performed by the RAs and identify possible barriers to the implementation of the&#xD;
      study according to each maternity ward. This training framework is consistent with the&#xD;
      literature since MI training indeed requires training in 2 steps with feedback training and&#xD;
      coaching in real situations after the initial training. Data collected during the 6-week&#xD;
      trial period will be discarded since the RAs will be practising conducting the study. Data&#xD;
      will only be used to monitor good clinical practices (GCPs) in each center during the audit&#xD;
      by the study coordinator. After this training, RAs will officially start the recruitment in&#xD;
      the maternity wards. The MI trainer will be available to answer questions and offer support&#xD;
      to the RAs regarding their MI techniques throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality protection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Source documents containing names, addresses and other contact information of participants&#xD;
      will be stored at each local site in individual folders, identified by the assigned&#xD;
      participant identification number (PID) number. These documents are stored in locked filing&#xD;
      cabinets in a secure research facility, with controlled access, limited to authorized staff&#xD;
      and investigators. No personal identifiers will appear in any summary or report of the study&#xD;
      data and will not be sent to the coordinating center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to identify a statistically significant amelioration of 8% in parents' intention to&#xD;
      vaccinate, and taking account of a basic intention to vaccinate of 78%, a risk of alpha error&#xD;
      of 0.05 and a power of 80%, a total of 400 parents by center will be included. This sample&#xD;
      size will also allow detect a minimum of 5% reduction in VH scores in each center. The total&#xD;
      sample of 1,600 families will allow detecting a significant amelioration of 6% in infants'&#xD;
      VC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      A descriptive analysis of responses from Q1, Q2 and Q3 will be conducted. Q1 and Q2 responses&#xD;
      as well as Q1 and Q3 responses (KAB, vaccination intention and VH scores) will be compared&#xD;
      for mothers belonging to the intervention group in order to assess intervention's&#xD;
      effectiveness, globally and for each participating center. Q1, Q2 and Q3 responses (KAB,&#xD;
      vaccination intention and VH scores) will be also compared between intervention and control&#xD;
      groups in order to demonstrate the MI intervention's effectiveness compared to the&#xD;
      information flyer. Parents' intention to vaccinate their infant measured before the&#xD;
      intervention will be dichotomized as &quot;certainly&quot; vs. &quot;probably&quot;; &quot;probably not&quot; and&#xD;
      &quot;certainly not&quot; and compared to all covariates measured before the intervention. Multivariate&#xD;
      logistic regression analysis will be conducted to identify independent determinants&#xD;
      influencing vaccination intention. Regarding VC, it will be defined as the proportion of&#xD;
      children having a complete vaccine status on the total of participating children. A child is&#xD;
      considered having a complete vaccine status if he has received all vaccines and antigens&#xD;
      recommended by his respective provincial immunization schedule at 3 months of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Q1 and Q2 responses (KAB, vaccination intention and VH scores) will be first compared using&#xD;
      McNemar's test and Wilcoxon's signed rank test for paired data for mothers belonging to the&#xD;
      intervention group. Thereafter, Q1, Q2 and Q3 responses (KAB, vaccination intention and VH&#xD;
      scores) will be compared between intervention and control groups using the Chi-square test or&#xD;
      the Fisher's exact test as appropriate while continuous variables will be compared using the&#xD;
      Student's t-test or the Mann-Whitney U test as appropriate. Moreover, covariates will be&#xD;
      compared with vaccination intention using the appropriate tests mentioned. In multivariate&#xD;
      analysis, collinearity of the variables included in the model will be checked and the model&#xD;
      adequacy will be assessed by the Hosmer-Lemeshow test and the deviance test. Finally, VC will&#xD;
      be analyzed globally, comparing proportion of properly vaccinated children between&#xD;
      intervention and control groups using the Chi-square test. The SAS software (version 9.4, SAS&#xD;
      Institute, Inc., Cary, NC) will be used for all statistical analysis.&#xD;
