      Optiflow can be used to prolong the apnoea period under anaesthesia without falls in blood&#xD;
      oxygen saturation. This study is designed to assess whether the Optiflow system can&#xD;
      efficiently replace conventional anaesthetic mask and circuit preoxygenation so that it could&#xD;
      be used in emergency anaesthesia. If so, it would be then be in place in the case of&#xD;
      difficult or failed intubation to maintain oxygenation ie: it could preoxygenate and then&#xD;
      maintain oxygenation seamlessly.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Optiflow device is used to deliver high flow humidified oxygen/air via nasal cannulae to&#xD;
      patients who have respiratory problems. More recently it has been used in patients having&#xD;
      surgery on their larynx who are intentionally paralysed under anaesthesia where the surgeon&#xD;
      does not want any tubes in the airway. This makes access for surgery easier/possible. Perhaps&#xD;
      surprisingly, these patients can be left apnoeic for 30 minutes without falls in blood oxygen&#xD;
      levels. The lungs are oxygenated despite there being no in and out breathing/ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose that applying Optiflow at the start of an emergency anaesthetic may be beneficial&#xD;
      when an anaesthetist finds that tracheal intubation is impossible - a &quot;failed intubation&quot;&#xD;
      scenario. Optiflow might maintain oxygenation during further attempts at intubation or until&#xD;
      more skilled anaesthetists arrive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another alternative technique presently in common use is for the patient to breathe 100%&#xD;
      oxygen via a facemask and conventional anaesthetic circuit for 3 minutes before anaesthesia&#xD;
      starts (preoxygenation). This fills the functional residual capacity of the lungs to about&#xD;
      90% oxygen giving an oxygen reserve when the breathing stops until the anaesthetist breathes&#xD;
      for them after intubating the trachea. This can result in the maintenance of normal blood&#xD;
      oxygen saturation for several minutes longer than would be the case if the lungs had only&#xD;
      been exposed to air before anaesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research question that we ask is whether we can just use Optiflow instead of the&#xD;
      conventional mask/circuit to preoxygenate patients to a similar extent and as quickly as&#xD;
      using a facemask so that, in emergency surgery, Optiflow could be used to preoxygenate and&#xD;
      then already be in place in case there is a failed intubation. This would enable Optiflow to&#xD;
      be used for both purposes seamlessly without the need to switch between the two methods of&#xD;
      oxygenation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research to date has not yet identified how long Optiflow needs to be in place before&#xD;
      anaesthesia for it to be able to produce adequate preoxygenation of the lungs before the&#xD;
      patient stops breathing. The 3 minute timing for preoxygenation is important in emergency&#xD;
      cases e.g. when there is an emergency caesarean section to be done and every minute before&#xD;
      the baby is delivered matters. If it were not possible to preoxygenate a patient's lungs&#xD;
      within 3 minutes using Optiflow we would suggest that it is inappropriate to replace&#xD;
      conventional mask pre-oxygenation and that its value in emergency anaesthesia might be&#xD;
      reduced (although it may still have potential for less urgent anaesthesia when it could be&#xD;
      applied for a longer duration before anaesthesia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a pilot study with 20 healthy volunteer students as subjects who will undergo an&#xD;
      up / down sequential analysis of Optiflow pre-oxygenation. They will be recruited from&#xD;
      posters inviting them to consider enrolling in the project. They will receive a subject&#xD;
      information sheet and will provide written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the study day an individual subject will lie supine on a trolley and the Optiflow device&#xD;
      will be fitted ready to administer humidified 100% oxygen at 45 l/min via the device's nasal&#xD;
      cannulae. The subject will be asked to breathe normally with a closed mouth and the device&#xD;
      will be switched on.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial test period will be for 3 minutes and at the end of that time the device will be&#xD;
      turned off with the subject holding their breath in inspiration and the subject will then&#xD;
      exhale and then breathe normally via a mouthpiece which has a side sampling port connected to&#xD;
      a standard gas monitor (as used during anaesthesia) which will measure and display the&#xD;
      expired oxygen percentage. This is known to equate very well to the alveolar oxygen fraction&#xD;
      in healthy subjects and the target value will be 85%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the initial test the subject will be asked to walk around breathing room air for at&#xD;
      least 15 minutes to return their lung gases to pre test normality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The process will then be repeated as before but for a different duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the target of 85% had not been reached within 3 minutes the 2nd test would be for 5&#xD;
      minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the 85% target had been reached the 2nd test would be reduced to 2.5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The test runs would continue in the same up/down fashion until the minimum time required to&#xD;
      reach 85% had been identified (to the nearest 30 seconds) or the subject had done test runs&#xD;
      up to 10 minutes long without reaching the target.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the subject wished to split the test runs over more than one session that would be&#xD;
      accommodated. They would also be free to leave the study at any time if they so desired.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequent subjects will have an initial test duration adjusted to the average of the&#xD;
      previous subjects so that they may not be required to undergo as many tests (this presumes&#xD;
      that there is not too much variation within the population) and will be less inconvenienced.&#xD;
