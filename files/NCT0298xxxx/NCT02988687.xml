      This PILOT, NON-INTERVENTIONAL STUDY will follow patients about to start rhGH for a period of&#xD;
      six months and collect valuable pilot data to evaluate feasibility of a larger study and&#xD;
      treatment tolerability and compliance. The effect of rhGH on cognitive function, depression,&#xD;
      fatigue, sleep quality, and QOL will also be collected. This exploratory study will also&#xD;
      provide important information about recruitment and AGHD screening procedures in military&#xD;
      settings.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Growth hormone replacement has consistently shown improvements in body composition, exercise&#xD;
      capacity, endothelial function, inflammatory biomarkers, bone mineral density, lipoprotein&#xD;
      metabolism, and self-reported quality of Life (QOL) in patients suffering from adult growth&#xD;
      hormone deficiency (AGHD). One of the causes for AGHD is traumatic brain injury (TBI), a&#xD;
      condition that affects approximately 20% of Veterans from Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF),&#xD;
      Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF), and Operation New Dawn (OND). Because OIF/OEF/OND Veterans are&#xD;
      a new population, there is a paucity of data regarding the effects of rhGH in these patients.&#xD;
      The investigators propose to perform a pilot observational study of Veterans with confirmed&#xD;
      adult growth hormone deficiency (AGHD) due to TBI who have been prescribed recombinant human&#xD;
      growth hormone (rhGH) replacement in order to determine changes in metabolic parameters and&#xD;
      QOL induced by rhGH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that GH replacement will improve QOL and metabolic parameters (glucose,&#xD;
      insulin resistance, lipids, inflammatory markers, and body composition) in patients with&#xD;
      confirmed AGHD due to TBI.The primary aim for this proposal is to determine the effects of&#xD;
      rhGH treatment given daily for 6 months to Veterans with TBI and AGHD on QoL measured by the&#xD;
      Quality of Life Assessment for GHD in Adults questionnaire (QoL-AGHDA, primary outcome).&#xD;
      Secondary specific aims for this proposal are to gather high quality pilot data of the&#xD;
      effects of 6 months of rhGH replacement in Veterans with TBI and AGHD.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Other untreated pituitary deficiencies [patients with other hormone deficiencies will&#xD;
             have to be on stable replacement for at least three months before including them on&#xD;
             the study; two months of stable replacement is required for hydrocortisone therapy for&#xD;
             adrenal insufficiency]&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. tumors, or other causes of AGHD (e.g. childhood onset GHD, pituitary surgery, tumors,&#xD;
             radiation)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. history of neurologic or psychiatric disorder such as stroke, spinal cord injury,&#xD;
             bipolar disorder, or schizophrenia that has a significant impact in the Veteran's&#xD;
             functional status and QoL&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. contraindication to rhGH therapy (e.g. hypersensitivity to rhGH or any of the&#xD;
             components of the supplied product, including metacresol, glycerin, or benzyl alcohol)&#xD;

             (TOMM)&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. due to the decreased specificity of the AGHD diagnostic tests in this setting and&#xD;
             weight/size limitations of the DEXA scanner, we will exclude morbid obese subjects&#xD;
