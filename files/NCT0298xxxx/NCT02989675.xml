      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of dextrose administration in severely&#xD;
      sick children admitted to hospital with low-glycaemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The problem: Mortality in children remains high in sub-Saharan African hospitals. While&#xD;
      antimalarial drugs, antibiotics and other definitive treatments are well understood, the role&#xD;
      of emergency care with supportive therapies such as maintaining normal glucose and&#xD;
      electrolyte balances, has been given limited attention. Hypoglycaemia is common in children&#xD;
      admitted to hospital in low-income settings. The current definition of hypoglycaemia is a&#xD;
      blood glucose level of less than 2.5mmol/l. Outcomes for these children are poor, with a&#xD;
      mortality rate of up to 42%. An increased mortality has also been reported among acutely ill&#xD;
      children with low-glycaemia, defined as a blood glucose level of 2.5-5.0mmol/l. The reason&#xD;
      for increased mortality rates is not fully understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study objective: To determine the impact on mortality of a raised treatment cut-off level for&#xD;
      paediatric hypoglycaemia, from 2.5mmol/l to 5.0mmol/l.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: Severely ill children admitted to two central Malawian hospitals; Queen&#xD;
      Elisabeth Central Hospital, Blantyre and Zomba Central Hospital, with low-glycaemia&#xD;
      (2.5-5.0mmol/l) will be randomised into intervention or control groups. The intervention&#xD;
      group will be treated with an intravenous bolus of 10% dextrose 5ml/kg followed by a dextrose&#xD;
      infusion in addition to standard care while the control group will receive standard care&#xD;
      only. Children will be followed until discharge from hospital or death. Primary end-point is&#xD;
      in-hospital mortality.&#xD;

      Enrolment started at Queen Elisabeth Central Hospital on Dec 5th 2016. Due to a slow&#xD;
      enrolment rate a second site at Zomba Central Hospital has been opened to start enrolment on&#xD;
      October 17th, 2017 in order for the project to be completed in December 2019.&#xD;

    <description>Children in the intervention group will immediately receive intravenous 5ml/kg 10% dextrose, Dextrose administration will continue as a maintenance infusion of intravenous 10% dextrose for 24 hours at standard maintenance rates.
