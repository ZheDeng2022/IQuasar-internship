      Objective: To determine the Overall Response Rate (ORR) to Imprime PGG + pembrolizumab in&#xD;
      subjects with advanced melanoma or metastatic TNBC&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety: To characterize the safety of Imprime PGG + pembrolizumab given in combination&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Restore (for melanoma) or enhance (for TNBC) sensitivity to checkpoint inhibitors&#xD;
      (CPI) by appropriate and effective stimulation of the subject's innate and adaptive immune&#xD;
      systems in those subjects who have failed 1st line therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will incorporate Simon's optimal 2-stage design with sample size fixed at 12&#xD;
      subjects each in Stage 1 for advanced melanoma and for Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC)&#xD;
      subjects. The safety criterion of ≤ 4 (or ≤ 33%) subjects with Grade 3/4 adverse events in&#xD;
      Cycle 1 within either tumor type must be met in order to proceed to Stage 2. The starting&#xD;
      dose is 4 mg/kg for Imprime PGG. In the event there are a total of &gt; 4 (or &gt; 33%) of subjects&#xD;
      with Grade 3/4 adverse events in Cycle 1, the dose of Imprime PGG will be reduced to 2 mg/kg,&#xD;
      and Stage 1 will be repeated at a dose of 2 mg/kg with an additional cohort of n=12 subjects.&#xD;
      For the dose that meets the safety criterion in Stage 1, at least 1 response in melanoma&#xD;
      subjects and 2 responses in TNBC subjects amongst the 12 subjects within each tumor type must&#xD;
      be observed in order to proceed to Stage 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2 will enroll an additional 17 subjects with melanoma, and 30 subjects with TNBC. For&#xD;
      the dose that meets the Stage 1 safety criterion, success will be declared if at least 4&#xD;
      amongst the total of up to 29 subjects with melanoma, and 13 amongst the total of up to 42&#xD;
      subjects with TNBC achieve an objective response.&#xD;
