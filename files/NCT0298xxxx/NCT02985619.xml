      Background: Diabetic macular edema (DME) shows a sustained functional and morphologic&#xD;
      response to anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) drugs, but the optimal approach&#xD;
      for persistent macular edema still in debate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: To evaluate 24-week visual and anatomical effects of intravitreal bevacizumabe or&#xD;
      triamcinolone in patients who had residual edema after 24-weeks to &quot;pro re nata&quot;(prn)&#xD;
      intravitreal bevacizumabe therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This study enrolled a total of 100 DME eyes. Each patient received &quot;prn&quot;&#xD;
      bevacizumabe therapy throughout 24 weeks. At week 24, patients who had recurrent or&#xD;
      persistent edema were randomized 1:1 to Group 1 (prn bevacizumane) or Group 2 (prn&#xD;
      triamcinolone). Patients with no recurrent or persistent edema at week 24 were comprised&#xD;
      Group 3 and continue received prn bevacizumabe. Prn treatment was administered when central&#xD;
      subfield thickness of the macula (CST) &gt; 300 µm and/or there were intraretinal cystoid spaces&#xD;
      in the fovea. Study visits occurred every 4 weeks with the endpoint at week 48. At each&#xD;
      visit, patients had an eye exam and CST, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), and intraocular&#xD;
      pressure (IOP) were assessed. Fundus photography and fluorescein angiography were also&#xD;
      performed at baseline, week 16, week 40, and week 48. Rescue therapy using laser&#xD;
      photocoagulation could be administered at the discretion of the Investigators. All patients&#xD;
      resumed standard care after exiting.&#xD;

      Methods Study Design. The current study is a prospective randomized clinical trial registered&#xD;
      at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02985619). The study protocol adhered to the tenets of the&#xD;
      Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the local Institutional Review Board, research&#xD;
      ethics committee of School of Medicine of Ribeirão Preto at University of Sao Paulo. All&#xD;
      patients gave written informed consent before entering one year study and were evaluated in&#xD;
      the Retina Section of Department of Ophthalmology, School of Medicine of Ribeirao Preto of&#xD;
      the University of Sao Paulo with center-involved DME in at least 1 eye between June 21, 2016&#xD;
      and December 22, 2017 were invited to participate in the study. Recruiting phase considered&#xD;
      the first 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population. Inclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) Eligible&#xD;
      participants were aged 18 years with diabetes mellitus (type 1 or 2); (2) center-involved&#xD;
      DME, defined as a central subfield thickness &gt;300 µm on SB-OCT, despite of macular laser&#xD;
      photocoagulation, cataract surgery and intraocular injection performed at least 4 months&#xD;
      previously; (3) best-corrected ETDRS visual acuity (BCVA) measurement between 0.3 logMAR&#xD;
      (Snellen equivalent: 20/32) and 1.3 logMAR (Snellen equivalent: 20/400); (4) signed informed&#xD;
      consent. Exclusion criteria. Exclusion criteria were: (1) vitreo-macular traction on SB-OCT;&#xD;
      (2) proliferative diabetic retinopathy needing panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) or&#xD;
      anticipated to need PRP in the next 12 months; (3) macular capillary dropout on fluorescein&#xD;
      angiography; (4) history of glaucoma or ocular hypertension (defined as an intraocular&#xD;
      pressure higher than 25 mm Hg); (5) an ocular condition (other than diabetes) that, in the&#xD;
      opinion of the investigator, might affect macular edema or alter visual acuity during the&#xD;
      course of the study (eg, retinal vein occlusion, uveitis or other ocular inflammatory&#xD;
      disease, neovascular glaucoma, etc); (6) systemic corticosteroid therapy; (7) any condition&#xD;
      that, in the opinion of the investigator, might preclude follow-up throughout the study&#xD;
      period; (8) Recent (within 3 months) thromboembolic events including acute myocardial&#xD;
      infarction (MI) and cerebrovascular accident (CVA); (9) Other Clinical trial participation in&#xD;
      the last 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and Intervention. After eligibility was determined, subjects with&#xD;
      center-involving DME were enrolled and underwent comprehensive ophthalmologic evaluation at&#xD;
      baseline and every 4 weeks up to week 48. Patients received monthly prn 1.25 mg (0.05 cc) IVB&#xD;
      throughout 24 weeks if central subfield thickness (CSFT) was greater than 300 µm. At week 24,&#xD;
      patients who had recurrent or persistent edema (CSFT&gt;300) were randomized 1:1 to Group 1 (prn&#xD;
      IVB therapy) or Group 2 (quarterly IVT therapy). Randomization was done from binomial&#xD;
      distribution with parameters that it enters as function arguments. Patients with no recurrent&#xD;
      or persistent edema (CSFT≤300µm) at 24-week were comprised to Group 3 and continued receiving&#xD;
      prn IVB therapy. If patient had edema in both eyes and the patient agreed to treat both eyes,&#xD;
      1 eye received the randomized treatment according to a computer-generated sequence and the&#xD;
      contralateral eye received the other therapy option on the next day; thus if an eye was&#xD;
      randomized to the IVB group I, the contralateral eye was allocated to the IVT group II and&#xD;
      the reverse was also true.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Examination Procedures and follow-up. Each patient received a detailed ophthalmologic&#xD;
      examination including measurement of BCVA according to the standardized ETDRS refraction&#xD;
      protocol using a retroilluminated Lighthouse for the Blind distance visual acuity test chart&#xD;
      (using modified ETDRS charts 1, 2, and R; Precision Vision, IL), as well as applanation&#xD;
      tonometry, slit-lamp biomicroscopic examination, indirect fundus examination, and fluorescein&#xD;
      angiography using high-resolution angiography (HRA; Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg,&#xD;
      Germany). Spectralis B-scan OCT evaluation (HRA-OCT; Heidelberg Engineering) was performed in&#xD;
      all patients, and retinal thickness measurements were acquired using a standard 20, 15-degree&#xD;
      raster scan protocol. CSFT values were calculated automatically as the average thickness of a&#xD;
      central macular region 1000 mm in diameter centered on the patient's foveola by built-in&#xD;
      Heidelberg software using retinal map analysis. Patients were scheduled for follow-up&#xD;
      examinations at monthly intervals. At these visits the BCVA was determined after ETDRS&#xD;
      refraction and complete ophthalmic examination similar to baseline valuations with the&#xD;
      exception of fluorescein angiography scheduled at baseline and week 36.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antiglaucomatous eyedrops criteria. Intraocular pressure (IOP) ≥ 25 mmHg and/or 10mmHg&#xD;
      increased from baseline measurement were adopted to initiate anti-glaucomatous eyedrops.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intravitreal Injection. All injections were performed using topical proparacaine drops under&#xD;
      sterile conditions (eyelid speculum and povidone-iodine). Topical antibiotics were not used&#xD;
      before the day of injection. Before the injection was performed, the eyelids were scrubbed&#xD;
      with 10% povidone-iodine, and 5% povidone-iodine drops were applied to the conjunctiva. The&#xD;
      time between application of 5% povidone-iodine solution to the conjunctiva and administration&#xD;
      of the intravitreal injection was 2 minutes. Povidone-iodine was applied to the conjunctiva&#xD;
      directly over the intended injection site.21-24 Care was taken in all cases to insure that&#xD;
      the needle did not touch the lids or lashes. Bevacizumab (1.25 mg/0.05 cc; F. Hoffmann- La&#xD;
      Roche Ltd., Basel, Switzerland) or Triamcinolone (1.20 mg/ 0.03 cc; Opthaac, Ophthalmos, São&#xD;
      Paulo, Brazil) was injected into the vitreous cavity using a 29-gauge 0.5- inch needle&#xD;
      inserted through the superotemporal pars plana 3.0-3.5 mm posterior to the limbus.25 After&#xD;
      the injection, central retinal artery perfusion was confirmed with indirect ophthalmoscopy.&#xD;
      Patients were instructed to instill 1 drop of 0.3% ciprofloxacin into the injected eye 4&#xD;
      times daily for 1 week after the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retreatment Protocol. Retreatment with the originally assigned treatment was performed&#xD;
      monthly if central subfield thickness was greater than 300 µm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rescue Therapy. If, after 3 consecutive injections, there was not a reduction in central&#xD;
      subfield thickness of at least 10% and/or an increase in BCVA of at least 5 letters compared&#xD;
      with baseline, the patient could continue to receive the same intravitreal medication for an&#xD;
      additional 3 consecutive visits or quit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes. Primary outcome measure: Mean change in CSFT from baseline to week 48. Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes measures: Mean change in BCVA from baseline to week 48; mean change in IOP at any&#xD;
      visit; lens status changes, mean number of intravitreous injections Sample Size. Sample size&#xD;
      and powering were based on a previous clinical trial on bevacizumab use for diabetic macular&#xD;
      edema30, where a mean change observed in central subfield thickness from baseline was 130 mm&#xD;
      with a standard deviation of 122 μm. Therefore, to have 80% power to detect a difference of&#xD;
      50 μm between central subfield thickness change found in both groups, the sample size&#xD;
      required in each group was 25 eyes. Thirty eyes per treatment group were required if one&#xD;
      assumed a 10% dropout rate. With this sample size, there is a 20% chance for a failure to&#xD;
      detect a true mean difference of at least 50 μm between the treatment groups (type I error),&#xD;
      or for an incorrect conclusion that a difference of at least 50 μm exists between the&#xD;
      treatment groups (type II error).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis. BCVA and central subfield thickness measured at each follow-up visit&#xD;
      were compared with baseline BCVA and CSFT values for within- and between-group comparisons,&#xD;
      which were performed using multiple analysis of variance (MANOVA) for repeated measurements.&#xD;
      Proportions of eyes with central subfield thickness ≤ 300 mm were compared using the&#xD;
      likelihood ratio x2 test. In addition, a multivariate analysis comparing BCVA and CSFT&#xD;
      outcomes in the prn-IVB group and qIVT group was performed, considering number of injections,&#xD;
      baseline BCVA, and CSFT as effects. A statistically significant effect was defined if P &lt;&#xD;
      .05, and a trend towards significance was reported if P &lt; .1. Statistical analyses were&#xD;
      performed using JMP 10.0.0 (2010; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, North Carolina, USA) software.&#xD;
