  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with functional features of diffusion weighted imaging (DWI)&#xD;
      are advancing imaging technologies that have potential to overcome limitations of&#xD;
      conventional staging methods, radiation treatment planning and the assessment of tumor&#xD;
      response in esophageal or esophagogastric cancer. This study aimed to explore the value of&#xD;
      MRI for the prediction of tumor response to chemoradiotherapy and accurate target volume&#xD;
      delineation as compared to CT simulation for patients with unresectable or potentially&#xD;
      resectable esophageal or esophagogastric cancer undergoing chemoradiotherapy. The average CT&#xD;
      texture features are also extracted before and during treatment to establish a model to&#xD;
      predict the prognosis or side effects (e.g. radiation pneumonitis or esophagitis) of&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

      1. Both DW-MRI and CT simulation will be performed before chemoradiotherapy and after 18-22&#xD;
           fractions. Also MRI will be performed after treatment. The investigators will contour&#xD;
           based on the MRI image and compare this with the standard CT plan before and during&#xD;
           treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The predictive potential of initial tumor ADC, and change in ADC during and after&#xD;
           treatment for tumor response will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The average CT texture features not only in the present study but also of those who&#xD;
           treated previously in our department (since 2014) will be extracted before and during&#xD;
           chemoradiotherapy to establish a model to predict the prognosis of patients.&#xD;
