      Target of the research Based on change of Brain-derived neurotrophic factor and other&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory cytokine along with symptom improvement following treatment, the&#xD;
      investigators are trying to find the new treatment target molecule. The investigators will&#xD;
      follow up the subjective and objective cognitive dysfunction with psychiatric symptom&#xD;
      profiles and compare the neuroimaging related to these change.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Recently the investigators reported the association between childhood trauma and refractory&#xD;
      depression, which related to Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF). Even though level of&#xD;
      peripheral BDNF is closely related to depression treatment, the investigators still have&#xD;
      little idea on role of BDNF. In this research, the investigators are going to find the&#xD;
      genetic variation affecting treatment response and process, figure out specific role of BDNF&#xD;
      in depressive patient correlated with Neuroimaging. Along with BDNF, many kinds of&#xD;
      proinflammatory cytokine showed increased amount related to depressive patient. Leptin,&#xD;
      adiponectin, and plasma tryptohphan are also seen to be related to response of depression.&#xD;
      Here, the investigators are trying to see specific difference on neuroimaging shown in&#xD;
      depressive patient related to peripheral marker. The investigators will evaluate the 36&#xD;
      depressive patients compared to 24 normal control. For depressive patients, after excluding&#xD;
      other bipolar spectrum disorder, psychotic disorder, other neurocognitive disorder, subjects&#xD;
      who have organic brain lesion, tested as HAM D score above 16, will be included in this&#xD;
      research. As a psychiatric evaluation, the investigators will do the MINI International&#xD;
      Psychiatric Interview Plus (MINI Plus), Suicidal ideation evaluation, Hamilton Depression&#xD;
      Inventory 17 (HAM D 17), Hamilton Anxiety Inventory (HAM A) to get the information of their&#xD;
      clinical severity. As a neuroimaging evaluation, the investigators will do the magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI) with diffusion tensor imaging and amyloid Positron Emission&#xD;
      Tomography(PET) to see the specific deposition. For peripheral marker for inflammation and&#xD;
      other neurotrophic factor, the investigators will do the platelet BDNF level,and other&#xD;
      pre-inflammatory factors. The investigators will also check for genotyping for BDNF. For&#xD;
      follow up evaluation, the investigators will keep up the psychiatric evaluation with HAM D,&#xD;
      HAM A and peripheral proteinomic evaluation with platelet BDNF level, and other&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory cytokines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research will figure out the correlation between neurotrophic factor as BDNF, and&#xD;
      inflammatory factor seen in peripheral blood assay with treatment response in depression.&#xD;
      Also the investigators are trying to integrate the peripheral change along with BDNF&#xD;
      genotyping and specific change seen in neuroimaging. Replicating this research with high&#xD;
      statistical power would be promising to find 'reliable peripheral marker for prognosis of&#xD;
      depression'.&#xD;
