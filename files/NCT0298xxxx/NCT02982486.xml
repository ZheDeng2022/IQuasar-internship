  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether nivolumab plus ipilimumab are effective and&#xD;
      safe in the treatment of sarcoma and endometrial carcinoma patients with somatic deficient&#xD;
      MMR as a selection tool.&#xD;

      The expected duration of this study is 36 months (18 months accrual period and 18 month&#xD;
      follow up period). Enrollment into the screening or treatment phase of the study will be&#xD;
      stopped when the actual subject numbers have been achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This single arm single institution, open label, prospective, phase II trial will evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of Nivolumab 240 mg IV every 2 weeks plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 6&#xD;
      weeks in patients with nonresectable/metastatic sarcoma or endometrial carcinoma with somatic&#xD;
      deficient MMR as a selection tool.patients. Number of patients in the study will reflect the&#xD;
      reconciliation between statistical requirements and incidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will continue until disease progression, development of unacceptable toxicity,&#xD;
      noncompliance or withdrawal of consent by the patient or investigator decision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All screening requirements must be completed within 28 days of the visit (except for Patients&#xD;
      will be examined on cycle 1 day-1 and every 2 weeks, including complete blood count (CBC) and&#xD;
      chemistry, until disease progression. CT/MRI imaging (contrast) will be performed every 6&#xD;
      weeks for response evaluation for the first 48 weeks and every 12 weeks thereafter. Clinical&#xD;
      benefit as well as individual categories of response (complete response (CR), partial&#xD;
      response (PR), stable disease (SD) and progressive disease (PD) will be determined using&#xD;
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 (RECIST). Response duration endpoints,&#xD;
      including median PFS, PFS at 12 and 24 weeks and OS will be assessed using the Kaplan-Meier&#xD;
      method. Toxicity (AEs) will be recorded using the NCI- Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse&#xD;
      Effects v 4.03 (NCI-CTCAE). Screening procedures will include immunostaining for MLH1, MSH2,&#xD;
      MSH6 and PMS2 all performed on formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue sections. In&#xD;
      addition tumor DNA, extracted from FFPE tissue (after choosing optimal area by a&#xD;
      Pathologist), will be submitted to FoundationOne for a later exploratory analysis.&#xD;
