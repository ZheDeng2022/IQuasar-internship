  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the Kentucky LEADS Lung Cancer Survivorship Care Program is to develop,&#xD;
      administer and evaluate the impact of a comprehensive psychosocial survivorship care program&#xD;
      for individuals diagnosed with lung cancer and their caregivers to improve lung cancer&#xD;
      survivorship and delivery of high-quality lung cancer care. The investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that the Kentucky LEADS Lung Cancer Survivorship Care Program will demonstrate improved&#xD;
      quality of life, better symptom control, increased tobacco treatment, and reduced distress&#xD;
      among lung cancer survivors and their caregivers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study design is a single-arm clinical trial, or a prospective cohort design, where a&#xD;
      longitudinal series of data will be collected from participants. Participants will be&#xD;
      consented and asked to complete a baseline questionnaire (PRE) which includes topics&#xD;
      measuring quality of life, distress, symptom management, social support, healthy behaviors,&#xD;
      demographics and health history. Two similar questionnaires will be administered after&#xD;
      exposure to the Survivorship Care Program (POST and FOL). In addition, the consent form&#xD;
      requests permission from survivors to collect clinical data from medical records and the&#xD;
      Kentucky Cancer Registry regarding diagnosis and treatment for lung cancer. The study will&#xD;
      enroll 300 participants, with an estimate of approximately 30 participants enrolled at each&#xD;
      site. However, if a participating site enrolls 30 participants and the overall study accrual&#xD;
      has not yet been met, the study PI may allow that respective participating site to continue&#xD;
      to enroll participants. Study accrual is competitive across participating sites until the&#xD;
      overall study accrual has been met.&#xD;
