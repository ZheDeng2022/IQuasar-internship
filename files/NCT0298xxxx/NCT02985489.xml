      Malnourished patients with IBD that receive pre-operative parenteral nutrition therapy will&#xD;
      have fewer post-operative complications compared to malnourished patients that receive&#xD;
      standard of care nutritional therapy.&#xD;

      Primary Objective To determine the impact of pre-operative PN therapy in malnourished&#xD;
      patients with IBD compared with standard of care nutritional therapy on the development of&#xD;
      total post-operative complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives To assess the impact of pre-operative PN therapy in malnourished&#xD;
      patients with IBD compared with standard of care nutritional therapy on the incidence of&#xD;
      post-operative infectious complications Primary Endpoint The primary endpoints will be the&#xD;
      incidence of post-surgical complications in malnourished patients receiving pre-operative PN&#xD;
      therapy compared with standard of care therapy Secondary Endpoints The secondary endpoints&#xD;
      will be the cumulative incidence of post-operative infectious complications in IBD patients&#xD;
      receiving surgery and hospital length of stay in patients receiving pre-operative PN therapy&#xD;
      compared to standard of care nutritional therapy METHODS Study Design This is a prospective&#xD;
      multi-center randomized controlled study. Allocation to either intervention or control group&#xD;
      will be randomized based on blocks system (size of 4). The randomization sequence will be&#xD;
      computer generated. Conjoint Ethics Review Board Approval for the study protocol will be&#xD;
      sought in conventional manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Withdrawal Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      (a) If there is any catheter - related complications (including infection) resulting in&#xD;
      catheter removal; (b) If the patient does not meet the goal therapeutic PN rate; (c) If the&#xD;
      duration between the PN initiation and the surgery is less than 7 days (e.g. if the patient&#xD;
      needed an emergency surgical intervention)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and Consent The overwhelming majority of patients with IBD are admitted to the&#xD;
      Gastroenterology Inpatient Service. As such, recruitment to this study will take a&#xD;
      multi-pronged approach and be stream-lined. All Gastroenterologists and Gastroenterology (GI)&#xD;
      Fellows in training at the FMC and PLC will be made aware of the protocol and as they are&#xD;
      rounding, they will be aware to ask any eligible patients if they would be willing to speak&#xD;
      with our research assistant about study participation. In addition, the research coordinator&#xD;
      assigned to the study will review the inpatient electronic medical record, Sunrise Clinical&#xD;
      Manager (SCM) daily to identify newly admitted inpatients to both study sites with IBD. The&#xD;
      research coordinator will review the study eligibility of the newly admitted inpatients with&#xD;
      the GI Fellows rotating on the GI service, and approach patients for protocol review and&#xD;
      consent once deemed eligible. All participants will undergo prospective consenting via a&#xD;
      written informed consent either by themselves or their family members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Intervention Experimental Group Participants assigned to the experimental group will&#xD;
      commence PN therapy delivered through central venous catheter (CVC) access within 24-48 hours&#xD;
      of admission. For the study, Olimel will be used as the PN formulation of choice.&#xD;
      Specifically, Olimel 5.7% with electrolytes will be the preferred study product. CVC access&#xD;
      is readily obtained at the FMC and PLC within this duration through a central venous access&#xD;
      team designated team for this purpose. A registered dietitian (RD) will be specifically&#xD;
      recruited for this study and will prescribe PN for eligible patients based on individualized&#xD;
      nutritional assessment. Eligible patients will be malnourished by definition, resulting in&#xD;
      conservative initial PN dosing to minimize the risk of refeeding syndrome . The study RD will&#xD;
      calculate energy requirements based on predictive equations, such as the Harris Benedict&#xD;
      Equation to determine target goals. The target protein and calorie requirements will be met&#xD;
      within 48-72 hours of PN initiation. The optimal duration of delivery of PN preoperatively&#xD;
      was defined by Klein et al , supported by an earlier meta-analysis by Detsky et al. The Klein&#xD;
      meta-analysis of 14 prospective randomized trials showed a consistent benefit from&#xD;
      preoperative PN, showing a 10% reduction in overall postoperative complications. Thirteen of&#xD;
      14 studies in this meta-analysis provided PN for at least 7 days , leading the Klein&#xD;
      suggestions that use of PN should not be considered unless the duration of therapy was&#xD;
      anticipated to be a minimum of 7 days. In accordance, PN will be administered for a minimum&#xD;
      of 7-days prior to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Group Participants assigned to the control group will receive standard of care (SOC)&#xD;
      nutritional therapy. Control group patients will be assessed by the RD assigned to the&#xD;
      medical unit to which the patient has been admitted (independent RD assessment). The unit RD&#xD;
      will follow standard nutrition screening processes to determine nutrition risk, followed by a&#xD;
      complete nutrition assessment in the presence of nutrition risk. Conventionally, patients&#xD;
      will complete calorie counts with clinical observation by the unit RD, with nutrition&#xD;
      support, typically enteral nutrition recommended when oral intake is inadequate. Failure of&#xD;
      EN to meet goal calorie intake may result in PN therapy at the discretion of the unit RD and&#xD;
      treating team.&#xD;
