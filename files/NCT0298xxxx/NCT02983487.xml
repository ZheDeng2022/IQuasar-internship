    <textblock>
      Due to waning of infectious as well as vaccine immunity and lack of vaccination boosters, a&#xD;
      large number of adolescents and adults are no longer immunized against Bordetella pertussis,&#xD;
      the agent of whooping cough and consequently may contract whooping cough. Furthermore, these&#xD;
      populations represent a reservoir of the infectious agent from which the dissemination to&#xD;
      non-immune infants is possible, causing severe illness, or even death, in this age group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Few studies have been carried out on whooping cough in developing countries (incidence,&#xD;
      contaminator's age, etc.) and, specifically, none have assessed the duration of protection&#xD;
      induced by the whole cell pertussis (wP) vaccine mainly presently used in these countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, data on the duration of vaccine induced protection are essential to determine i) the&#xD;
      usefulness of vaccine boosters and ii) the target age group for these boosters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of the present study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the proportion of confirmed pertussis cases in infants presenting whooping&#xD;
           cough syndrome (WP1a)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the proportion of confirmed pertussis cases or healthy carriers among&#xD;
           contact cases&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine origin of the infant's contamination (WP1b)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the duration of protection induced by the wP vaccines used in contact cases&#xD;
           and the child population aged 3 to 15 yo (WP1b and WP2)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To bring new scientific evidences documenting the potential need for initiating boosters&#xD;
           (WP1b and WP2)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To allow a comparison of the results with those obtained using the same methodology for&#xD;
           the acellular pertussis vaccine and/or in other contexts. Potential implications for the&#xD;
           use of pertussis vaccines in low and moderate income countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To increase local capabilities by the transfer of materials and expertise that will make&#xD;
           the diagnosis of pertussis possible in the centres of reference and strengthen a&#xD;
           pertussis monitoring network in the implicated countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To improve children's health through a better match of the vaccination schedule&#xD;
           according to the reality of the situation.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vaccination of infants and young children with a whole-cell pertussis (wP) vaccine&#xD;
      dramatically decreased the mortality and morbidity due to B. pertussis. However, twenty-five&#xD;
      years of &quot;honeymoon&quot; period, after the introduction of high vaccination coverage,&#xD;
      reappearance of whooping cough cases in industrialized countries was observed in infants&#xD;
      contaminated by adolescents and adults. This modification in transmission of the disease&#xD;
      after the introduction of the wP vaccine indicated that the immunity provided by the vaccine&#xD;
      is not lifelong, just like that provided by natural infection, and that it decreases7-9 years&#xD;
      after the first vaccination and the first booster. Due to secondary effects, wP vaccines&#xD;
      cannot be used for boosters. Moreover, the wP vaccines have been shown to be different in&#xD;
      terms of efficacy (varying from 30 to 95%). Acellular pertussis (aP) vaccines consisting of&#xD;
      purified and inactivated bacterial proteins, have therefore been developed and&#xD;
      commercialized. These vaccines induce much fewer side effects and may therefore be used for&#xD;
      primary-vaccination as well as for vaccine boosters. They are expensive but have more&#xD;
      reproducible manufacturing. The humoral and long-term cell-mediated immunities granted by the&#xD;
      aP vaccines have been shown to be comparable to the immunity granted by the wP vaccines,&#xD;
      effective for 6-7 years after the booster vaccine in the second year of life, also inducing&#xD;
      different cell immunity. Since 2007, the proportion of B. pertussis and B. parapertussis&#xD;
      isolates no longer producing vaccine antigen(s) has increased in the industrialized countries&#xD;
      that use aP vaccines. These isolates may decrease the efficacy of the aP vaccines. Does this&#xD;
      type of isolates circulate in the Low income countries still using wP vaccines ? Does it&#xD;
      reduce the efficacy of the wP vaccines? Moreover, the wP vaccines used in the Southern&#xD;
      countries have not been assessed like the ones used in the Northern countries. In particular,&#xD;
      the duration of protection after the primary-vaccination and a vaccine booster is not known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rational:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For various reasons, a large difference exits between the monitoring systems across the&#xD;
      world: awareness of the disease is variable depending on the population; differences in the&#xD;
      immunization coverage and strategies; diverse compositions of the vaccines used; but overall&#xD;
      the large differences between the vaccines in terms of immunity against the disease,&#xD;
      protection against infection and/or decrease in the transmission of the pathogen. The&#xD;
      underestimation of pertussis is recognized by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the&#xD;
      (Global Pertussis Initiative) who highlight the problem of the reliability of the declared&#xD;
      data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This situation is the result of i) limited use of biological diagnostics (problems in&#xD;
      isolating the bacteria in the laboratories); ii) diagnostic errors due to the fact that&#xD;
      diagnosis is mainly clinical ; iii) inadequate monitoring of the illness ; iv) a lack of&#xD;
      awareness among physicians. Pertussis is not considered when it is comes to identifying the&#xD;
      respiratory pathogen: most clinicians continue to consider it as only a child illness and&#xD;
      ignore adult infections. The absence of an available tool allowing a reliable diagnostic to&#xD;
      be made makes difficult to assess the real impact of this pathogen in child respiratory&#xD;
      syndromes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have been performed on the duration of protection induced by the wP and aP&#xD;
      vaccines in Australia, the USA and in Europe. However, few studies have been performed on the&#xD;
      wP vaccines used in middle and low income countries and none in Cambodia, Madagascar and&#xD;
      Togo. This is one of the objectives of our study. This will allow the vaccination strategy of&#xD;
      each region concerned to be adapted when needed, as recommended by the WHO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impact on vaccination strategy:This study, as well as the analysis of data from other&#xD;
      national programs for the surveillance of Pertussis, may raise public health authorities'&#xD;
      awareness and help them adapting their assessment method for national vaccination programs by&#xD;
      including the duration of protection induced by their national wP vaccine and their data on&#xD;
      vaccine coverage, on the basis of the information in vaccination booklets, as recommended by&#xD;
      WHO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impact on the improvement the children's health: The results of our study should raise the&#xD;
      public health authorities' awareness on vaccine-preventable diseases, especially whooping&#xD;
      cough. This raising of awareness will focus on the surveillance/monitoring and diagnosis of&#xD;
      this disease. Moreover, the development of reliable biological diagnostic tools for pertussis&#xD;
      will help the clinicians to confirm pertussis diagnosis and to adapt the therapeutic approach&#xD;
      accordingly, thus improving the care of the infected person and to stop transmission of the&#xD;
      disease which is very contagious.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impact on the surveillance of the disease by developing an hospital-based&#xD;
      surveillance,Training, technology transfer and strengthening of the surveillance network: For&#xD;
      the first time, the detection and identification techniques for the other species of&#xD;
      Bordetella genus (i.e. B. parapertussis and B. holmesii) will be transferred to laboratories&#xD;
      in low income countries. The diagnosis of the different Bordetella species by real time&#xD;
      polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and the measure of anti-pertussis toxin Immunoglobulin G&#xD;
      (IgG) level by serological tests will be set up in the laboratories participating in this&#xD;
      study. These laboratories could further be used by the national surveillance network and thus&#xD;
      improve the quality of the data available for the local health authorities and for WHO. Thus,&#xD;
      this study will allow the establishment of an effective monitoring of pertussis in the&#xD;
      countries participating in the study through the raising of the population's awareness, the&#xD;
      training of local doctors on the clinical screening of this disease, and finally via the&#xD;
      transfer of diagnostic techniques within the laboratories.&#xD;
