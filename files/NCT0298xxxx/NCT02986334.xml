  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to examine brain properties for placebo response in chronic back pain&#xD;
      patients. The investigators have preliminary data indicating that, in blinded clinical trial&#xD;
      studies with neutral instructions regarding treatment, chronic back pain (CBP) patients can&#xD;
      be subdivided into placebo responders and non-responders, and these differences are&#xD;
      PREDICTABLE a priori, by brain activity. The results imply that CBP placebo may have clinical&#xD;
      utility and that its properties can be studied by human brain imaging techniques. In Phase I&#xD;
      of the study, the investigators seek to identify brain imaging parameters that predict the&#xD;
      propensity for the placebo response in an independent CBP cohort. In Phase II, the&#xD;
      investigators will evaluate the interaction between placebo response and medication treatment&#xD;
      in individuals stratified as placebo responders versus non-responders. This research is&#xD;
      designed to critically assess the neurobiology of placebo analgesia for chronic pain in a&#xD;
      partially-blind clinical trial.&#xD;

      Visit 1 (week -3): Screening visit (90 min):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be evaluated with inclusion/exclusion criteria and complete the informed&#xD;
      consent documents. A medical/pain history will be taken and physical exam will be completed&#xD;
      by a physician and participants will be asked to rate their current back pain intensity.&#xD;
      Participants will complete a set of 10 questionnaires that will ask about health and medical&#xD;
      history, past and current pain levels, personality, and emotions. Participants will be&#xD;
      allowed to take breaks and walk around during this time so that participants don't get tired&#xD;
      while filling out questionnaires. Finally, participants will have blood drawn for screening&#xD;
      purposes including to see if kidneys and liver are functioning as they should (the&#xD;
      investigators will take 40 mL or about 8 teaspoons). Participants will be asked to return in&#xD;
      2 weeks for baseline magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Participants will be asked to&#xD;
      discontinue current pain medications 14 days prior to Visit 2 and take only the rescue&#xD;
      medication (&quot;rescue&quot; medication that is also known as acetaminophen/Tylenol Â®), given for&#xD;
      pain during this time (see below) - this is so that the investigators can assess baseline&#xD;
      amount of pain. Participants will be informed that they may be randomized in the placebo&#xD;
      group and/or the no-treatment group (Visit 3) once one qualifies to continue in the study.&#xD;
      Participants must, therefore,a be willing and able to stop taking the medication for pain for&#xD;
      up to a maximum of 12 weeks during this study. Participants will be given acetaminophen (500&#xD;
      mg, up to 4 times per day) to take for pain relief (as rescue medication), a dose that can be&#xD;
      continued throughout the study. Participants are free to stop participation at any point in&#xD;
      the study. Participants randomized into the treatment arm may receive the anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      drug naproxen, since it is known to increase the risk of stomach and intestinal side effects,&#xD;
      a combined naproxen/esomeprazole drug regimen will be given to participants to provide some&#xD;
      protection for these types of side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2 (week -1): Baseline Scan (90 min):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will rate their pain intensity, complete questionnaires, and undergo brain&#xD;
      scanning (anatomical and functional scans). Participants will receive medication, which can&#xD;
      be used if the pain becomes too much to handle (500 mg four times per day maximum). The&#xD;
      researcher will ask participants about how often participants used the &quot;rescue&quot; medication&#xD;
      and any changes in health they may have experienced since the last visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3 (week 0): Start of Treatment Period and Randomization (30-45 min):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will rate their pain intensity and complete questionnaires. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomized into either a drug (placebo or naproxen and esomeprazole) treatment group or no&#xD;
      treatment group; if participants are assigned to a treatment group (active or placebo),&#xD;
      neither participants nor the clinical coordinator/assistant will know which group&#xD;
      participants are allocated in. Enough medication will be given to participants to last until&#xD;
      the next visit. The placebo group will receive two placebo capsules twice daily and the&#xD;
      active drug group will receive one naproxen capsule (500mg) and one esomeprazole capsule&#xD;
      (20mg) twice daily (morning and night) for the treatment period. The medication (Naproxen or&#xD;
      Placebo) needs to be taken with at least one full glass (8 oz) of water and the other&#xD;
      medication (Esomeprazole or Placebo) should be taken one hour before a meal. The researcher&#xD;
      will provide the study medication; if participants were randomized into the no treatment&#xD;
      group, participants will only receive rescue medication. The researcher will ask participants&#xD;
      about how often participants used the &quot;rescue&quot; medication and any side effects participants&#xD;
      experienced since Visit 2 took place. Additional &quot;rescue&quot; medication will be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 4 (week 3): Continuing Assessment (30-45 min). The procedures described for Visit 3&#xD;
      will be repeated during this visit. The researcher will ask participants about how often they&#xD;
      used the &quot;rescue&quot; medication and any side effects experienced since Visit 3 took place. As&#xD;
      well, the researcher will ask how often participants took the study medication (if in a&#xD;
      treatment group) and document the total pills ingested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 5 (week 6): End of Treatment/Start of Washout and Final Scan (60-90 min):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedures described for Visit 2 will be repeated during this visit. The researcher will&#xD;
      ask participants about how often and reliably participants took the medication (if in a&#xD;
      treatment group), as well as how often they used the &quot;rescue&quot; medication and any side effects&#xD;
      experienced since Visit 4 took place. Participants will only receive the &quot;rescue&quot; medication&#xD;
      for the upcoming 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 6 (week 9): Final Visit/End of Washout (30-45 min):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will return to complete questionnaires, but no brain scans will be done. The&#xD;
      researcher will ask participants about how often they used the &quot;rescue&quot; medication and any&#xD;
      side effects experienced since Visit 5 took place. If participants are in one of the&#xD;
      treatment groups, participants will be asked to return all of the study medication and rescue&#xD;
      medication at this time, and all treatment will be stopped at this visit.&#xD;
