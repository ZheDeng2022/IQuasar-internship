      Clinical studies so far have been limited, and larger volume and multi-center studies studies&#xD;
      are needed. The purpose of this pilot study is to look for a clinical correlations between&#xD;
      the aggressivity panel developed from biomarkers thought to affect the progression or&#xD;
      aggressivity of endometriosis, pain and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our goal with the study is find a correlation between the &quot;aggressivity&quot; of endometriosis&#xD;
      with clinical factors determined in our study questionnaires. The &quot;aggressivity panel&quot; was&#xD;
      pioneered by the EndoDiag lab in France, and was created using markers thought to affect the&#xD;
      activity or progression of endometriosis. This information could lead to a better&#xD;
      understanding of the disease, and ultimately lead to more targeted therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a patient returns for a second surgery we will ask their permission to use their slides&#xD;
      from their first and seconed surgery to compare. The tissue that is being removed during the&#xD;
      surgery as standard of care to make slides for the research study (there will not be an&#xD;
      endometrial biopsy performed for research purposes with the second surgery). The slides from&#xD;
      surgery 1 &amp; surgery 2 will then be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a clinical correlation is found with the aggressivity panel, the goal would be to create a&#xD;
      local lab and tissue bank here in the United States that could provide a basis for&#xD;
      collaborative national (even international) research. Also, if a correlation is found, future&#xD;
      investigation will look at correlations of the aggressivity panel and fertility outcomes.&#xD;
      Results of this pilot study will help to direct studies of treatment protocols of the various&#xD;
      stages of aggressivity of endometriosis.&#xD;

      The study design is an investigator-initiated pilot, prospective cohort study (Canadian Task&#xD;
      Force, II-3). Patients will not be randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consecutive subjects from age 14-55 will be recruited and included in the study if they are&#xD;
      seeking treatment of pain and with suspected or known endometriosis. Patients who are&#xD;
      menopausal (either chemically-induced, natural or surgical) will not be included in the&#xD;
      study. Patients who are pregnant are not eligible for surgery, and not eligible to be in the&#xD;
      study. Subjects will be excluded if they are found not to have endometriosis confirmed by&#xD;
      histology. All surgeries are performed at a single institution, St. Mary's Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An ad hoc sample size calculation is not possible for this pilot study, since we have no&#xD;
      historic data on which to base such a calculation. The goal is to acquire 45 panel results,&#xD;
      as a reasonable amount of data for a pilot study, and given the funding available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life (measured by the 100-point scale and by the EHP-5) and pain indices (measured&#xD;
      by the VAS scale) will be measured at up to six different time points: before surgery, six&#xD;
      months after surgery, and one year after each surgery. At each time point you will compare&#xD;
      quality of life and each pain index across the four aggressivity groups of low, moderate,&#xD;
      medium, and high using analysis of variance (ANOVA) or the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test&#xD;
      depending on the normality of the distributions. Pairwise comparisons will also be made using&#xD;
      independent students t test or the non-parametric Kolmogorov-Smirnov test depending on the&#xD;
      normality of the distributions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The follow-up time frame for each surgery will be 1 year. Patients will receive&#xD;
      questionnaires pre op and at 6-months and 1 year for both the first surgery and the second&#xD;
      surgery( if needed). The entire study will take about 4 years, including data analysis and&#xD;
      publication. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is related to IRB #20900. Subjects who consent to participate in this study may&#xD;
      also be consented to participate in 20900. The pre-operative and follow-up questionnaires,&#xD;
      and the standardized tools relating to QOL and depression are the same as in IRB#20900.&#xD;
