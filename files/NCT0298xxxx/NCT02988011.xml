  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this explorative randomized clinical study, the investigators aim to study metabolic,&#xD;
      cellular, and molecular changes that occur during weight loss in obese subjects with and&#xD;
      without type 2 diabetes. Using novel &quot;imiomics&quot; (imaging technique using PET/MR&#xD;
      bioinformatics) analyses to examine possible metabolic differences between energy restricted&#xD;
      diet and gastric by-pass surgery on whole-body and tissue specific insulin sensitivity,&#xD;
      glucose tolerance, metabolite and protein profiles, fatty acid metabolism, ectopic fat&#xD;
      content, and gene expression in adipose tissue. This study aims to identify novel biomarkers&#xD;
      and drug targets for type 2 diabetes as well as validate promising and established biomarkers&#xD;
      in an interventional model for improved glucose metabolism.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      By using omics platforms such as genomics, proteomics and metabolomics we can have large&#xD;
      amount of information about metabolic changes at both tissue and whole body level. In&#xD;
      parallel to this, clinical imaging modalities such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and&#xD;
      Positron Emission Tomography (PET) have developed rapidly, allowing for whole-body studies of&#xD;
      how different tissues are involved in systemic diseases. Furthermore, new hybrid systems such&#xD;
      as integrated PET-MRI provide combined information of human morphology and function. The&#xD;
      integration of PET with MRI reduces the radiation dose compared with PET-CT to acceptable&#xD;
      levels for metabolic studies. To handle the large amounts of data from these examinations we&#xD;
      are currently developing an image analysis concept, &quot;Imiomics&quot;, that allows holistic analysis&#xD;
      of whole-body imaging data with integration of non-imaging data. In the current study, we&#xD;
      plan to use PET-MRI as well as imiomics methodology, together with gold standard methodology&#xD;
      to assess insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance in vivo. We aim to conduct a randomized&#xD;
      study (CRUDOS study; Caloric Restriction Using Diet Or Surgery) to study glycometabolic&#xD;
      effects before and after gastric bypass surgery and low-calorie diet in subjects at different&#xD;
      stages of glucose tolerance (i.e. obese subjects with and without T2D).&#xD;
