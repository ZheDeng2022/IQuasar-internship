  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infections are a major and prevalent life-threatening complication among patients with&#xD;
      myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Currently, the role of prophylactic antibacterial agents&#xD;
      after chemotherapy in MDS patients remains controversial and there are no clinical guidelines&#xD;
      for infection prophylaxis in this clinical setting. We will conduct a prospective study to&#xD;
      evaluate the potential benefit of prophylactic antibacterial (Levofloxacin) on the rate of&#xD;
      febrile episodes/infections in Azacytidine treated MDS patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a national, multicenter, phase III, randomized, parallel arms, double blind, placebo&#xD;
      controlled clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of antibacterial prophylaxis -&#xD;
      Levofloxacin 500mg/d given p.o.in newly diagnosed MDS patients who are more than 18 years of&#xD;
      age and fulfil an indication for Azacytidine treatment. Patients will be treated for up to 4&#xD;
      cycles of Levofloxacin, or placebo. Subjects allocated to the treatment arm of the study will&#xD;
      be administrated Levofloxacin 500mg/d given p.o. once a day, starting on day 10 from&#xD;
      beginning of each cycle until day 28. Subject allocated to the placebo arm will be treated&#xD;
      with placebo once a day, starting on day 10 from beginning of each cycle until day 28.&#xD;
      Levofloxacin and placebo treatment will be continued in the first 4 Azacytidine cycles. This&#xD;
      study consists of 3 periods for each study subject: pre-treatment period, treatment period&#xD;
      and follow up period. Expected duration of subject participation is 6 months Pre-treatment&#xD;
      period: Assessments: MDS evaluation by bone marrow examination including cytogenetics/ FISH&#xD;
      must be performed within half a year of the first dose of study drug.&#xD;
