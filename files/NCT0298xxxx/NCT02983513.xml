  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preterm infants, during their stay in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), face a period&#xD;
      of stressful environment, which may negatively impact early brain development and subsequent&#xD;
      neurobehavioral outcomes. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of training parents in&#xD;
      reducing stressful experiences early in life and in enhancing brain development and long term&#xD;
      developmental outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Very preterm birth is associated with motor, cognitive and behavioral problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Micro-structural brain abnormalities, even in the absence of focal lesions, have been&#xD;
      documented by neuroimaging studies in preterm infants at term corrected age and later in&#xD;
      childhood. These alterations in brain maturation occurring during the neonatal period may be&#xD;
      implicated in long-term neurobehavioral disorders later experienced by preterm babies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there is increasing evidence that also negative environmental factors (intensive&#xD;
      care, excessive sensory stimulation, paucity of parental contact etc.) can affect later&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential benefits of early dyadic interaction and preterm baby massage in reducing the&#xD;
      effects of the NICU stressor environment have been demonstrated. More recently, few studies&#xD;
      have investigated visual function in preterm infants focusing on the potential role of early&#xD;
      visual interaction to enhance attention and improve later neurodevelopment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of early intervention strategies to improve neurodevelopment has been recently&#xD;
      emphasized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early intervention programs based on the concept of &quot;individualized care&quot; have proved to be&#xD;
      effective in promoting brain maturation and neurodevelopmental outcome. In this context,&#xD;
      early interventions as the Mother Infant Transaction Program (MITP) and the Premie Start,&#xD;
      both targeting parenting, have the greatest potential to have sustained effects on child&#xD;
      development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, recent studies have shown that exposure to stressful events in the neonatal&#xD;
      period can cause epigenetic modifications in children born preterm; in particular alteration&#xD;
      of serotonergic tone was observed, associated with methylation of the serotonin transporter&#xD;
      gene, which could be implicated in the etiology of behavioral disorders observed in these&#xD;
      children. In animal models these epigenetic effects appear to be influenced by maternal care&#xD;
      that can epigenetically modulate the offsprings' stress response.&#xD;

    <time_frame>40 weeks postmenstrual age</time_frame>
    <description>Neonatal Visual Function is assessed using the Visual Assessment Battery developed by Ricci et al. The assessment evaluates the following items: Ocular spontaneous motility, ability to fix and follow a target, reaction to colour, visual acuity and visual attention at distance. Each item is scored as normal (score 0) or abnormal (score 1). The global score is then calculated as the sum of all the individual items, as designed by the authors.</description>

    <description>The early intervention program is delivered during the NICU stay, according to the MITP and Premie Start Protocol, in order to train parents to: recognize signs of infant stress and alert-available behavior to promote mother-infant interaction; adopt principles of graded stimulation; optimize interactions and avoid overwhelming infants through facilitation strategies (for example, engage and support the visual attention of the newborn). The program is held in eight main sessions and one additional post-discharge session.&#xD;
In addition parents are trained and invited to daily promote preterm baby massage therapy and visual attention according to a detailed protocol.</description>
