  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Remote monitoring of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) for patients has led to&#xD;
      efficient, safe, and satisfying analysis of their device and cardiac status; resulting in an&#xD;
      overall improvement in the quality of care for such patients. Despite the efficacy of remote&#xD;
      monitoring of ICDs and the satisfaction of patients and providers with the process, there is&#xD;
      a desire from patients to have access and view ability of the data their ICD is transmitting.&#xD;
      However, methods for making ICD device data directly available to the patients are not&#xD;
      currently in place. This study aims to elicit the impact of standardized remote monitoring&#xD;
      ICD data to patients through an electronic personal health record (ePHR) on patient&#xD;
      engagement, healthcare utilization, and patient-provider communication. For this study,&#xD;
      patients with an ICD manufactured by St. Jude Medical and that are undergoing remote&#xD;
      monitoring through the remote management system, Merlin.net™, will receive a standardized&#xD;
      format of their electronic remote monitoring ICD data in MyChart, the ePHR used at Parkview&#xD;
      Health. The standard format for the electronic remote monitoring ICD data, as it is delivered&#xD;
      to the patient, will be termed the ICD Patient Notification Summary. Additionally, provider&#xD;
      attitudes and perceptions regarding the value of the Patient Notification Summary, its impact&#xD;
      on clinic workflow, and patient-provider communication will be collected.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, patients receive a letter by postal mail from their physician's office with a&#xD;
      statement about their ICD status. The St. Jude Medical ICD data is managed by the Merlin.net™&#xD;
      remote monitoring system and maintained in the database with periodic transfer to the&#xD;
      healthcare providers EHR system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is the first large study that will evaluate the impact of transferring information from&#xD;
      the ICD manufacturer's remote monitoring system directly into a patient's ePHR for the&#xD;
      purpose of making select information readily available to patients in the form of a report,&#xD;
      called the ICD Patient Notification Summary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ICD Patient Notification Summary will be transmitted to the healthcare providers' EHR&#xD;
      system (Epic) from Merlin.net™ as part of the data flow pathway to the patients' ePHR&#xD;
      (MyChart). This will ensure that the Arrhythmia Diagnostic Center (ADC) clinic and other&#xD;
      healthcare providers will be able to view the same information that the patients will&#xD;
      receive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients from the intervention group and control groups will answer a baseline survey. The&#xD;
      baseline survey will assess socio-demographic characteristics, patient engagement, and&#xD;
      patient satisfaction with the current standard of care as well as patient perceptions about&#xD;
      receiving remote monitoring ICD data in their ePHR. The survey will be administered either&#xD;
      paper-based or online, using a secure online survey program, Survey Monkey. Patient&#xD;
      engagement will be assessed using the short form Patient Activation Measure (PAM) survey&#xD;
      copyrighted by Insignia Health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Patient Activation Measure (PAM) is a validated survey tool developed by Judith Hibbard,&#xD;
      PhD, MPH of the University of Oregon, which assesses the degree a patient acts as an active&#xD;
      agent in their own health care. PAM is associated with improved health outcomes6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will respond to two follow up surveys in approximately 3 months and 6 months from&#xD;
      the baseline survey. The follow up surveys will assess patient engagement, patient&#xD;
      satisfaction and perceptions with the ICD Patient Notification Summary or current standard of&#xD;
      care as well as technology acceptance, depending on the group randomization. Technology&#xD;
      acceptance will be assessed using the Technology Acceptance Model as a framework and will&#xD;
      explore patient attitudes regarding ease of use, usefulness and intentions to use the ePHR&#xD;
      and ICD Patient Notification Summary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Technology Acceptance Model is a commonly used model, originally developed by Fred Davis&#xD;
      and Richard Bagozzi, which predicts technology acceptance based on the user's perceived&#xD;
      usefulness and perceived ease of use of the technology for a specific purpose 7,8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chart review will be performed to collect past and current data regarding patient's&#xD;
      socio-demographic characteristics, comorbidities, laboratory and interventions, and&#xD;
      healthcare utilization. These data points will help provide background and descriptive&#xD;
      information to supplement the other components of the study. ICD-related data and events as&#xD;
      well as measurement and classification of clinic calls will be assessed starting six months&#xD;
      prior to the study period and continuing throughout the study period. The amount and type of&#xD;
      healthcare utilization in relation to cardiac care will be collected. Data related to the use&#xD;
      of MyChart will also be collected.&#xD;
