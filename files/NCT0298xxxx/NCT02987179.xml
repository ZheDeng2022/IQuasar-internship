    <textblock>
      The clinical diagnosis of sleep apnea is difficult among ESRD patients since the&#xD;
      characteristic clinical features of sleep apnea may be absent and since sleep-related&#xD;
      symptoms, such as fatigue and sleepiness, may be attributed to kidney failure. However, the&#xD;
      evaluation of patients with possible sleep apnea is the same among ESRD patients as in the&#xD;
      general population.&#xD;
