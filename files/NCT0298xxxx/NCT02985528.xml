  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinical risk assessment and management is mostly relevant in emergency. Thoracic ultrasound&#xD;
      (TUS) has been proposed as an easy-option replacement for chest X-ray (CXR) in Emergency&#xD;
      diagnosis of pneumonia, pleural effusion and pneumothorax. Investigators investigated CXR&#xD;
      &quot;unforeseen diagnosis&quot;, provided by TUS, exploring usefulness and sustainability of&#xD;
      telementoring aimed at the management of clinical risk. This observational report includes a&#xD;
      period of six months with a proactive concurrent adjunctive telementoring in TUS diagnosis&#xD;
      using freely available smartphone applications for the transfer of images and movies.&#xD;

      The present study describes a six months period of specialist activity of an Emergency&#xD;
      Department physician. The aim is to display the performance in the subsets of difficult or&#xD;
      unexpected thoracic ultrasound imaging performed by TUS, in a context with the prompt&#xD;
      availability of all radiological facilities. The interaction of TUS telementoring, using&#xD;
      WhatsApp® or Skype®, provided by another colleague, in another city and hospital, with a&#xD;
      greater specific expertise in TUS, was devised to assure a concurrent mentorship by the&#xD;
      School. This training has included a subsequent revaluation of clinical cases by the&#xD;
      Ultrasound Course Lecturer in TUS and by the Director of the School of Clinical Ultrasound,&#xD;
      with a reappraisal overview of all the available information. The approach was clinical and&#xD;
      instrumental, and included:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. clinical history; B. clinical examination of chest, neck, joints and abdomen; C.&#xD;
      sequential ultrasound examination of the abdomen, thorax, pericardium; D. focus on pain&#xD;
      symptoms: of chest, abdomen (with or without distention), lumbar region, neck; E. focus on&#xD;
      dyspnea and/or cough and/or fever with detection of humid or dry lung sounds, chest dullness,&#xD;
      of heart and/or pleura-pericardial sounds, and/or jugular congestion, checking also the&#xD;
      mobility of the diaphragm and evaluating the collapsibility of the cava vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TUS was generally conducted with the patient in a sitting position, although the few patients&#xD;
      (predominantly children), likely to experience severe discomfort during the procedure, were&#xD;
      scanned in a semi-supine position. A systematic examination of all intercostal spaces was&#xD;
      performed and TUS images, if present, were assessed for the number, location, shape, size,&#xD;
      and breath-dependent changes in consolidation areas. Two main types of pattern of lung&#xD;
      consolidation attributable to pneumonia were defined: hypoechoic consolidation and mixed&#xD;
      consolidation. The presence of air bronchogram, fluid bronchogram, and basal pleural effusion&#xD;
      was also reported. The size of the consolidation area was measured longitudinally and&#xD;
      transversally, using the longest measurement, i.e., the maximal length of the consolidation&#xD;
      area visible by TUS, for data analysis. For the purpose of this report, details on the&#xD;
      measurements are not detailed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second opinion was provided outside the Hospital facility by a mentor (FMT), expert in&#xD;
      Clinical Ultrasound, answering to the questions related to the images of videoclips of the&#xD;
      actual patient in emergency. Images and movies were sent by WhatsApp. Reappraisal was&#xD;
      performed subsequently, using all the available imaging - photos and videoclips, the clinical&#xD;
      records and the outcome information, as obtainable by a short-term follow-up.&#xD;
