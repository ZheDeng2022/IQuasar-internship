      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the correlation of the Compensatory Reserve Index&#xD;
      (CRI) numeric and graphical trend readings to intravascular volume changes as compared to&#xD;
      graded blood loss (removal of 20% of estimated total blood volume in ~333 mL aliquots) and to&#xD;
      stroke volume as measured by the Nexfin monitor during the same graded blood removal period.&#xD;
      Enrollment includes both men and women.&#xD;

      Sequential Blood Loss: Blood loss will be simulated by withdrawal of 20% of estimated total&#xD;
      blood volume. Estimated total blood volume for men = 75 mL/kg and for women = 65 mL/kg. The&#xD;
      calculated target withdrawal volume is also consistent with an allowable estimated blood loss&#xD;
      equation assuming a starting hematocrit (hct) of approximately 45% in males and 40% in&#xD;
      females, where the expected drop in hct for this volume withdrawn is 7 percentage points in&#xD;
      males and 6 percentage points in females. An actual drop in hct may not be observed in this&#xD;
      study due to the relatively expedient removal of blood and no simultaneous administration of&#xD;
      fluids (i.e., no &quot;hemodilution&quot; with crystalloid). Blood will be removed in aliquots up to&#xD;
      ~333 mL. For safety, men will have no more than 4 units of blood removed (1,333 mL) and women&#xD;
      will have no more than 3 units of blood removed (1,000 mL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blood will be withdrawn via the venous catheter and we anticipate that it will take 15-20&#xD;
      min for each stage of blood withdrawal to occur. A total of 3 aliquots will be withdrawn over&#xD;
      approximately sixty minutes in women and 4 aliquots withdrawn over 80 minutes in men. The&#xD;
      blood will be stored using preservatives and anticoagulation procedures similar to those used&#xD;
      for perioperative hemodilution and/or intraoperative cell saver. The blood will remain in the&#xD;
      study room until it is re-infused. We will use standard &quot;auto-transfusion&quot; blood collection&#xD;
      equipment identical to that used in the ORs for perioperative hemodilution techniques. The&#xD;
      blood will be drained by gravity from an indwelling vascular catheter into anti-coagulant&#xD;
      preservative solution using tubing and bags systems provided by the autologous transfusion&#xD;
      team that we routinely work with in the ORs. For the first several studies we will schedule&#xD;
      them at a time when auto-transfusion OR personnel can be present and after that the&#xD;
      anesthesiologists will be directly involved in drawing the blood, subsequent handling and&#xD;
      reinfusion. The blood will never leave the autologous transfusion bag and a closed system&#xD;
      will be used. The blood will be held at room temp with gentle agitation for ~60-80 minutes&#xD;
      and then re-infused over 60-80 minutes via a large bore IV; monitoring will continue during&#xD;
      reinfusion. Following completion of the reinfusion subjects will de-instrumented and observed&#xD;
      in the physiology lab for two hours.&#xD;
