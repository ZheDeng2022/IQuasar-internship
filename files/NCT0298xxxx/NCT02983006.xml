  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety profile, tolerability, and&#xD;
      immunoregulatory (pharmacodynamic; PD) activity of DS-8273a administered in combination with&#xD;
      nivolumab (anti-PD-1 antibody) to subjects with unresectable Stage III or Stage IV melanoma.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Principal investigator hypothesize that TRAIL D5 antibody DS-8273a administered in&#xD;
      combination with nivolumab will be well tolerated and that the addition of DS-8273a will&#xD;
      augment the clinical efficacy of nivolumab.&#xD;
