    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of d-cycloserine (DCS) treatment for&#xD;
      Gulf War Illness (GWI). Gulf War veterans with Gulf War Illness experience numerous chronic&#xD;
      health symptoms, including cognition and fatigue, which reduces their quality of life. Gulf&#xD;
      War veterans are in urgent need of novel treatment plans to tackle elusive symptomatology of&#xD;
      Gulf War Illness. By using the literature of previous studies, the investigators have chosen&#xD;
      to investigate d-cycloserine as a possible candidate for treating GWI, specifically cognitive&#xD;
      symptoms. DCS has been shown to reduce neuroinflammation, regulate glutamate levels, and&#xD;
      improve synaptic functioning in key areas of the brain.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our study is a pilot study for the novel treatment of d-cycloserine to treat GWI. Our study&#xD;
      will consist of two experimental groups of equal size (n=28): DCS treatment group and a&#xD;
      placebo group. Participants will be randomized into either group; with a double blind study&#xD;
      design. Participants will be instructed to self-administer their treatment pills once per day&#xD;
      for 28 days. There will be a total of 6 study visits that will include medical and&#xD;
      neuropsychological assessment. The first visit will be for establishing eligibility and&#xD;
      baseline functioning. Three visits (visits 2-4) will occur during the medication trial (day&#xD;
      1, day 2 and two weeks into medication/placebo). Visit 5 will occur around the time&#xD;
      medication/placebo is finished. Visit 6 (follow up) will occur one month after&#xD;
      medication/placebo is complete.&#xD;
