  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is a life-threatening medical condition that occurs due to a sudden disruption of&#xD;
      blood supply to the brain. Although it may affect all age groups including children, the&#xD;
      elderly are at a greater risk of having strokes. Indeed, three-quarter of all strokes are&#xD;
      seen in people over the age of 65. Unfortunately, due to short therapeutic window (4.5 h of&#xD;
      stroke onset), only 2-3% of patients can receive the currently available single medical&#xD;
      therapy with rt-PA, a clot-busting agent. As recent studies show that bone marrow-derived&#xD;
      endothelial progenitor cells, a type of stem cells, may migrate to the site of injury to&#xD;
      repair the damaged brain vessels and tissue, it is possible that their numbers and functional&#xD;
      capacity may determine the clinical outcome of stroke patients i.e. severely disabled,&#xD;
      moderately disabled or no signs at all. This study will assess these parameters in elderly&#xD;
      stroke patients compared to their age-matched stroke-free counterparts and healthy young&#xD;
      volunteers.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ischaemic stroke develops through an interference with blood supply to the brain and&#xD;
      continues to be one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the World. Global&#xD;
      medical statistics reveal that ~75% of all stroke patients are older than 65 years and that&#xD;
      the stroke occurrence more than doubles every 10 years after the age of 55 in both men and&#xD;
      women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although various mechanisms may alter the structure and function of the adult brain during&#xD;
      the aging process, endothelial dysfunction is regarded as the main pathology that renders&#xD;
      cerebral vessels susceptible to atherosclerosis and subsequent vascular events. Endothelial&#xD;
      dysfunction also constitutes the main cause of vascular abnormality in most lacunar strokes&#xD;
      which result from occlusion of one of the penetrating arteries deep within the brain.&#xD;
      Cortical strokes represent another common form of ischaemic stroke and develop from an&#xD;
      embolism from the heart or large arteries. As the endothelium maintains vascular balance&#xD;
      through regulation of many distinct functions like vascular permeability, tone and&#xD;
      inflammation, it is of crucial importance to preserve its integrity and function at all times&#xD;
      to prevent age- and stroke-related vascular damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies show that bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) play a key&#xD;
      role in sustaining appropriate endothelial function by re-endothelialisation of blood vessels&#xD;
      in adult brain and ischaemic settings. Like embryonic angioblasts, EPCs are equipped with an&#xD;
      inherent capacity to circulate, proliferate and differentiate. Hence, the markers of&#xD;
      endothelial maturity (KDR), immaturity (CD133) and stemness (CD34) must be simultaneously&#xD;
      detected in relevant studies to identify all endothelial-committed and undifferentiated&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is likely that environmental changes, like oxidative stress, inflammatory responses and&#xD;
      nitric oxide availability, evoked by ischaemic injury and aging may also suppress the&#xD;
      generation and function of EPCs. As mobilisation, recruitment and homing of EPCs to sites of&#xD;
      vascular injury are mediated by various growth factors like the SDF-1 (stromal cell-derived&#xD;
      factor-1), VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) and GCSF (granulocyte-colony stimulating&#xD;
      factor), it is likely that the diminished expression of these factors may also negatively&#xD;
      influence the number and function of EPCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interestingly, while there is little data on functional and numerical alteration of EPCs&#xD;
      during the chronic phase of stroke, current data regarding EPC levels during acute and&#xD;
      subacute phases of disease are inconsistent in that stable, increased or decreased numbers&#xD;
      have been reported as compared to healthy subjects.The time course of EPC release after acute&#xD;
      cerebral infarction also remains inconclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In light of the above, the aims of the current study are to reveal whether 1- variations in&#xD;
      circulating EPC levels and/or their functional aspects may be used as markers to identify&#xD;
      ischaemic stroke subtypes and predict patients' outcome; 2- differences in EPC&#xD;
      number/function during acute, subacute or chronic phases of stroke correlate with severity&#xD;
      and functional outcome of ischaemic stroke; 3- EPC counts and function are affected by aging&#xD;
      process; and 4- levels or activity of key pathophysiological elements like VEGF, inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines and nitric oxide, known to affect EPC count and function, differ between patients&#xD;
      with lacunar and cortical strokes and between stroke patients and healthy counterparts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY MANAGEMENT Independent outcome assessments (mRS, BI, NIHSS) will be performed on&#xD;
      admission and days 7, 30 and 90 after stroke. The laboratory procedures will be carried out&#xD;
      by a post-doctoral research fellow who will collate and analyse the data. The Chief&#xD;
      Investigator has overall responsibility for the study and shall oversee all study management.&#xD;
      The data custodian will be the Chief Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PARTICIPANT DURATION Each participant with stroke will be followed-up for 90 days from the&#xD;
      time of recruitment. Elderly and young healthy volunteers will be seen only once.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RECRUITMENT Participants will be recruited from Nottingham University Hospitals Stroke&#xD;
      Services. The initial approach will be from a member of the patient's usual care team (which&#xD;
      may include the investigators) who will inform the participant or their nominated&#xD;
      representative of all aspects pertaining to participation in the study. It will be explained&#xD;
      to the potential participant that entry into the study is entirely voluntary and that their&#xD;
      treatment and care will not be affected by their decision. It will also be explained that&#xD;
      they can withdraw at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PARTICIPANT WITHDRAWAL Participants may be withdrawn from study in cases of disease&#xD;
      progression and withdrawal of consent. The participants will be made aware that this will not&#xD;
      affect their future care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INFORMED CONSENT No patient will be recruited into the study without obtaining their written&#xD;
      informed consent. In cases of incapacity, the consent of an appropriate personal consultee&#xD;
      will be sought. The Investigator will explain the details of the study and provide a&#xD;
      Participant Information Sheet. Participants will be offered 24 hours to consider&#xD;
      participation. However, they will be allowed to consent at an earlier time, if they prefer.&#xD;
      In cases where stroke patients regain capacity, they will be re-consented for their ongoing&#xD;
      participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICS All results including subject characteristics will be reported as meansÂ±SD.&#xD;
      Continuous variables, including age and circulating EPC level will be analysed by independent&#xD;
      t-test among groups. Circulating EPC levels at different time points (within 48 h and on days&#xD;
      7, 30 and 90 post-stroke) will be compared using the repeated measures of ANOVA. Scheffe's&#xD;
      multiple comparison will be used to analyse the intra-individual courses of parameters over&#xD;
      time. These will then be compared among patients with lacunar and cortical strokes. Multiple&#xD;
      logistic regression analyses will determine the independent impact of different predictive&#xD;
      variables on functional outcome and neurological deficits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size have been calculated to allow for failures of patient attendance on days 30 and&#xD;
      90 (~15% for each time point) and possibility of patients illness/death during the course of&#xD;
      the study (~5%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADVERSE EVENTS As this is not an interventional study, no adverse event is anticipated to&#xD;
      develop because of it. Adverse events of venepuncture will be dealt with according to&#xD;
      standard practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA PROTECTION The study form will only collect the minimum required information for the&#xD;
      purposes of the study. Study forms will be held securely, in a locked room, or locked&#xD;
      cupboard or cabinet. Access to the information will be limited to the study staff and&#xD;
      investigators and relevant regulatory authorities. Computer held data including the study&#xD;
      database will be held securely and password protected. All data will be stored on a secure&#xD;
      dedicated web server. Access will be restricted by user identifiers and passwords (encrypted&#xD;
      using a one way encryption method). Information about the study in the participant's medical&#xD;
      records / hospital notes will be treated confidentially in the same way as all other&#xD;
      confidential medical information. Electronic data will be backed up every 24 hours to both&#xD;
      local and remote media in encrypted format.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DATA Monitoring of study data shall include confirmation of informed consent; source&#xD;
      data verification; data storage and data transfer procedures; local quality control checks&#xD;
      and procedures, back-up and disaster recovery of any local databases and validation of data&#xD;
      manipulation. The Academic Supervisor, or where required, a nominated designee of the&#xD;
      Sponsor, shall carry out monitoring of study data as an ongoing activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Entries on study forms will be verified by inspection against the source data. A sample of&#xD;
      study forms (10% or as per the study risk assessment) will be checked on a regular basis for&#xD;
      verification of all entries made. In addition the subsequent capture of the data on the study&#xD;
      database will be checked. Where corrections are required these will carry a full audit trail&#xD;
      and justification. Study data and evidence of monitoring and systems audits will be made&#xD;
      available for inspection as/when required.&#xD;
