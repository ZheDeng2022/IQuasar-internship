      Obesity among Hispanic children in the Lower Yakima Valley of Washington State is alarmingly&#xD;
      high. This study proposes to implement a comprehensive, multi-level intervention among&#xD;
      children, families, the schools, and the community to combat this problem. The two year&#xD;
      intervention will be measured by examining changes in children's body mass index.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Childhood obesity rates in the Lower Yakima Valley of Washington State are alarming: 34% of&#xD;
      youth are obese compared to the state average of 23%. A large proportion of those children&#xD;
      are Hispanic; Hispanics represent 47% of the population in Yakima County and 67% of the&#xD;
      population in the Lower Yakima Valley. In January 2013, the investigators study received a&#xD;
      planning grant from the National Institute of Minority Health and Health Disparities to build&#xD;
      and enhance community capacity and infrastructure on childhood obesity initiatives in the&#xD;
      Lower Yakima Valley. This project began with the community as they expressed concern at the&#xD;
      high incidence of obesity among Hispanic children in the Valley. In the ensuing two and a&#xD;
      half years, the investigators and the community used community-based participatory research&#xD;
      (CBPR) to 1) form a community advisory board (CAB); 2) build a Steering Committee; 3) conduct&#xD;
      a comprehensive multi-level needs assessment; 4) develop and institute a pilot study; and 5)&#xD;
      evaluate our activities. In response to RFA MD-15-010, the investigators and the community&#xD;
      are now prepared to implement the intervention activities that were successful in our pilot&#xD;
      study into a large-scale quasi-experimental intervention trial. The multi-level interventions&#xD;
      will include activities at the individual level, family level, school level, and community&#xD;
      level. Activities include distributing comic books to students about healthy eating and&#xD;
      physical activity, a multi-generational level family intervention that teaches families about&#xD;
      healthy eating and cooking skills as well as physical activity, a variety of school events to&#xD;
      teach children about the food industry as well as encourage them to be physically activity at&#xD;
      small intervals in the classroom, and community activities to foster the idea of the&#xD;
      community being a healthy place for kids. The overall goal of this project is to continue to&#xD;
      use a CBPR approach; in so doing, test the effectiveness of the comprehensive, multi-level&#xD;
      intervention on reducing children's BMI z-scores, the primary endpoint. BMI z scores will be&#xD;
      assessed by taking height and weight measures of the children at baseline, 12 months, and 24&#xD;
      months. This study will recruit and enroll a total of 900 Hispanic children in grades 3rd to&#xD;
      5th (ages 8-12 years) who attend the four elementary schools in the intervention community&#xD;
      and the four elementary schools in the comparison community. Schools in both communities will&#xD;
      be matched based on student standardized test scores, percent of students eligible to receive&#xD;
      free or reduced-price lunch, and school size. Secondary outcomes include dietary patterns and&#xD;
      accelerometer data of physical activity in a subgroup of 180 Hispanic children. Community&#xD;
      participation in this project has been extraordinary and our letters of support indicate the&#xD;
      communities' enthusiasm for this project.&#xD;
