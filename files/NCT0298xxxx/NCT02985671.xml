  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the fixed combination of orphenadrine,&#xD;
      acetaminophen, caffeine and diclofenac sodium is more effective in the treatment of an acute&#xD;
      episode of mechanical postural low back pain than Voltaren®. Will be randomized 110&#xD;
      participants of both sexes, aged 18 years or older and less than 65 years of age with an&#xD;
      acute episode of mechanical postural low back pain and they will be allocated to one of two&#xD;
      treatment groups: Group 1: Fixed combination of orphenadrine, acetaminophen, caffeine and&#xD;
      diclofenac sodium; or Group 2: Voltaren®&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The fixed combination of orphenadrine 35mg, acetaminophen 325mg, caffeine 65mg and diclofenac&#xD;
      sodium 50mg aims to provide patients with anti-inflammatory, analgesic and myorelaxant action&#xD;
      with adequate safety and tolerability profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diclofenac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory with analgesic, anti-inflammatory and&#xD;
      antipyretic action and is effective in the treatment of a variety of acute and chronic&#xD;
      inflammatory and painful conditions. Its anti-inflammatory effect occurs by inhibiting the&#xD;
      synthesis of prostaglandins by inhibiting COX-1 and COX-2 in an equipotent manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Orphenadrine, on the other hand, is a central acting muscle relaxant that has analgesic and&#xD;
      anticholinergic effects. It presents clinical efficacy in the treatment of painful conditions&#xD;
      associated to pictures such as strains and sprains, especially of acute character, among&#xD;
      other musculoskeletal conditions that present with pain and muscular contracture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concerning acetaminophen, its a drug with analgesic and antipyretic action as well as&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory properties. It is widely used in a wide variety of pathologies with a focus&#xD;
      on the treatment of mild to moderate pain. It is a non-opioid analgesic with action in the&#xD;
      inhibition of cyclooxygenase and consequently in the production of prostaglandins, with&#xD;
      potency similar to that of aspirin. It is the analgesic of choice for children, the elderly&#xD;
      and pregnant women. It has been used successfully in the treatment of back pain. The&#xD;
      association between acetaminophen and orphenadrine is known and clinically effective in&#xD;
      analgesia, as well as the combination of acetaminophen and diclofenac, which also provides&#xD;
      clinical efficacy in the management of acute postoperative pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lastly, caffeine, an alkaloid belonging to the group of methylxanthines, is an agonist that&#xD;
      competes with adenosine receptors, acting in these receptors in very varied areas, such as&#xD;
      throughout the peripheral circulation and in the cerebral cortex. Caffeine enhances the&#xD;
      effects of other analgesics, improves acetaminophen pharmacokinetics, and induces mood&#xD;
      changes. All these mechanisms may contribute to improve the analgesic action of&#xD;
      acetaminophen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The association of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory, muscle relaxant, analgesic and caffeine&#xD;
      in the symptomatic treatment of painful conditions associated with the musculoskeletal system&#xD;
      is quite old.&#xD;
