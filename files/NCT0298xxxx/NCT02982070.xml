  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aims of this study are to (1) assess the extent of psychological distress for incoming&#xD;
      first-year students at the University of Tulsa (Part 1), (2) assess the impact of &quot;mental&#xD;
      toughness&quot; training on the trajectory of psychological well-being and academic success (Part&#xD;
      2), (3) assess the impact of mental toughness training on neural and behavioral reactivity to&#xD;
      affective stimuli and decisions (Part 3), and (4) examine genetic markers of resiliency in&#xD;
      college populations and interactions between genetic markers and response to mental toughness&#xD;
      training (Part 2).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Part 1 will consist of an online survey, sent by email. This email will be sent through the&#xD;
      TU (University of Tulsa) Student Affairs office to all incoming freshman students and will&#xD;
      also be sent by study personnel to students who indicate interest in the study through the&#xD;
      other recruitment efforts (i.e., flyers on campus). This survey will also allow students to&#xD;
      indicate whether or not they would be interested in being involved in future research&#xD;
      regarding mental toughness and strategies for college success. The second aim will be&#xD;
      accomplished via Part 2 of the study. Part 2 is the longitudinal portion that assesses&#xD;
      students' well-being (i.e., happiness, distress, anxiety, satisfaction, etc.) and academic&#xD;
      success (i.e., retention at TU, GPA, etc.) before and after completion of either mental&#xD;
      toughness training or &quot;college as usual&quot;. These participants will be selected from the group&#xD;
      of participants who complete Part 1 and/or via ongoing courses within each college at the&#xD;
      university (see recruitment section). Part 2 will enroll a maximum of 300 participants/year&#xD;
      for the first 3 years, each of whom will then be asked to remain in the study for 5 years.&#xD;
      These participants will be contacted via phone, text message, or email to determine whether&#xD;
      they are interested and meet criteria. Those who meet criteria will be scheduled for an&#xD;
      in-person session at TU (Part 2) to complete written informed consent, provide the saliva&#xD;
      sample, obtain instructions regarding the completion of survey sessions and the training&#xD;
      protocol. Those who enroll in this study will then be asked to complete survey sessions&#xD;
      repeatedly over the next 5 years: (1) During the first semester, Part 2 participants will be&#xD;
      asked to complete three survey sessions, one pre- and one post- training phase, and one&#xD;
      during finals week. (2) During the Spring semester of the first year, each participant would&#xD;
      complete three surveys (within the first two weeks; mid semester; and during finals week),&#xD;
      followed by one survey mid-Summer. (3) For Years 2-5, survey sessions would occur once per&#xD;
      semester (Fall, Spring, Summer), allowing examination of how training may impact longer-term&#xD;
      trajectories of academic success and psychological well-being. Each online surveys will&#xD;
      assess for psychological well-being, demographics and medical history, and academic&#xD;
      activities. For those who provide consent for us to access limited information from academic&#xD;
      records (as specified in the consent and in the research protocol section of this document),&#xD;
      the information will be combined with the collected survey data. For Part 3, data will be&#xD;
      collected from a subset of participants during two neuroimaging sessions at LIBR (Laureate&#xD;
      Institute for Brain Research). The first neuroimaging session will be completed within one&#xD;
      month of beginning the training phase (mental toughness or &quot;college as usual&quot;) and the second&#xD;
      will be completed within one month of the end of the training phase. Each neuroimaging&#xD;
      session will last approximately 3-4 hours and will involve completion of self-report measures&#xD;
      regarding current affective state, a behavioral measure of exploratory behavior, and a&#xD;
      functional MRI session during which participants will complete tasks related to processing of&#xD;
      emotional faces, emotional images, and reward. The fourth aim will also be accomplished via&#xD;
      Part 2 of the study, which involves the collection of DNA saliva collection once during the&#xD;
      first semester of their first year. Samples will be collected in-person at their first&#xD;
      baseline session, after written informed consent is obtained. This data will be used to&#xD;
      assess any genetic markers of resiliency that exist in college populations and to determine&#xD;
      if there are genetic markers that interact with the impact of mental toughness training&#xD;
      (i.e., if individuals with specific genetic markers do better or worse with training).&#xD;

&#xD;
          5. Able to provide informed consent (or, if 17, to have their parents complete informed&#xD;
             consent and the minor complete informed assent).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Have sufficient proficiency in English language to understand and complete interviews,&#xD;

             hematologic, rheumatologic, or metabolic disturbance; or any other condition that, in&#xD;
             the opinion of the investigator, would make participation not be in the best interest&#xD;
