      The aim of this study is to establish whether patients with mild primary hyperparathyroidism&#xD;
      (PHPT) have an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases. The primary outcome is to determine&#xD;
      whether arterial stiffness and blood pressure will decrease in patients with mild PHPT&#xD;
      3-month after parathyroidectomy (PTX).&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cardiovascular manifestation of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) has been debated in&#xD;
      many years. PHPT was once a highly symptomatic disease with severe symptoms. Today, the&#xD;
      clinical presentation of the disease is often asymptomatic or with few symptoms at diagnose.&#xD;
      This may be the reason why the literature regarding this area is conflicting. Studies have&#xD;
      observed an increased mortality cause by cardiovascular diseases (CVD) in moderate to severe&#xD;
      disease, whereas other studies with focus on mild disease observed no increased risk of&#xD;
      mortality. A shift in the clinical presentation of the disorder to a more asymptomatic&#xD;
      appearance makes it pivotal to investigate CVD risk in patients with PHPT before and after&#xD;
      surgery. Large-arterial stiffness is known to be a predictor of cardiovascular events and&#xD;
      all-cause mortality. Measurement of carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) is considered&#xD;
      as the gold standard for non-invasive measurement of arterial stiffness. To date, only few&#xD;
      studies have investigated the relationship between PWV and PHPT. In three prospective studies&#xD;
      the authors reported a significant increase in PWV preoperative in PHPT patients compared to&#xD;
      controls. 6-month after parathyroidectomy two of the studies observed a significant decrease&#xD;
      in PWV, where one study observed a non-significant decrease. Another study by Ring et al&#xD;
      observed only a slightly, but significant increased PWV in PHPT patients compared to controls&#xD;
      and no changes after surgery at 1-year follow-up. However, a study by Tordjman et al observed&#xD;
      no differences in PWV among PHPT patients compared to controls. In addition, other studies&#xD;
      have explored the relationships between arterial stiffness and PHPT using either augmentation&#xD;
      index (AIx) or carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) as predictors for arterial stiffness.&#xD;
      Three studies with focus on AIx reported an increased AIx in PHPT patients, whereas two other&#xD;
      studies observed no increased AIx in PHPT patients compared to controls. Using the IMT&#xD;
      methods, two studies reported a significant increased IMT in PHPT patient preoperative&#xD;
      compared to controls and a significant decrease after parathyroidectomy. Furthermore, a study&#xD;
      by Walker et al observed an increased IMT in PHPT patients compared to controls but in a&#xD;
      subsequent follow-up study there was no changes in IMT after surgery. In contrast, one study&#xD;
      reported no differences in IMT in PTHP patients before and after surgery. Most research so&#xD;
      far has focussed on different methods for measurements of arterial stiffness which makes a&#xD;
      comparison among studies difficult. More research with focus on one of the methods is&#xD;
      necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another clinical aspect of PHPT is the increased prevalence of hypertension compared to the&#xD;
      general population. Previous research findings into parathyroidectomy's effect on&#xD;
      hypertension have been inconsistent and contradictory. Four studies reported no effect of&#xD;
      parathyroidectomy on preoperative hypertensive patients and in two studies they observed an&#xD;
      increased incidence in hypertension after surgery. However, in four other studies they&#xD;
      observed a significant postoperative reduction in systolic and diastolic BP among known&#xD;
      hypertensive patients at follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevertheless, much uncertainty still exists and more research investigating the relationship&#xD;
      between BP and arterial stiffness pre- and postoperative is required. PWV is considered the&#xD;
      gold standard for non-invasive measurements of arterial stiffness and a predictor for&#xD;
      cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality. It is therefore the best approach to assess&#xD;
      the association of PHPT and cardiovascular risk in combination with BP. In addition, until&#xD;
      now study design has been prospective with small population sizes. Therefore, we need to&#xD;
      perform a randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing arterial stiffness and blood pressure&#xD;
      (BP) in patients with mild PHPT pre- and post-operative. This study will be the first&#xD;
      performed randomized controlled trial (RCT) investigating arterial stiffness and BP in&#xD;
      patients with PHPT. Hopefully, this study will be able to establish the cardiovascular risk&#xD;
      in patients with mild PHPT and have an influence on future international guidelines for&#xD;
      management of PHPT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to establish whether patients with mild PHPT have an increased risk&#xD;
      of cardiovascular diseases. The primary outcome is to determine whether arterial stiffness&#xD;
      and BP will decrease in patients with mild PHPT 3-month after parathyroidectomy (PTX).&#xD;
      Arterial stiffness will be assessed as PWV and BP as sitting- and 24-hour BP. In addition,&#xD;
      the study will evaluate the effect of PTX on serum cholesterol and other markers of&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients with PHPT have an increased cardiovascular risk assessed by BP, PP (central&#xD;
           pulse pressure) and arterial stiffness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. PWV, PP and BP in patients with PHPT will decrease 3-month after PTX.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be performed as a RCT enrolling patients with PHPT. Participants will be&#xD;
      assessed at baseline and subsequently randomized to one of two study groups, i.e., a group in&#xD;
      which PTX is performed as soon as possible (&quot;early PTX group&quot; [EPTX-group]) and a group in&#xD;
      which PTX is performed three months after study inclusion (&quot;late PTX group&quot; [LPTX-group]).&#xD;
      Follow-up will be performed 3 months after PTX in the EPTX-group and after 3 months of&#xD;
      observation in the LPTX-group. All enrolled participants will undergo PWV, PP, BP and blood&#xD;
      samples at baseline and at 3-month follow-up. Since women are affected by the disease&#xD;
      substantially more often than men are, the randomization will be performed as a bloc&#xD;
      randomization with 4 participants in each bloc. In each bloc two participants will be&#xD;
      randomized to either EPTX or LPTX. With a minimum of 80 participants (see statistic section&#xD;
      for power calculation) enrolling in the study 20 blocs will be created. Four of the blocs&#xD;
      will be allocated to the men in the study. The first man included will start with the&#xD;
      randomization number 64 and then the following men will be given numbers up to 80. If the men&#xD;
      included in the study are an unequal number, a bloc with a mix of women and men will be&#xD;
      constructed. Because of the inclusion criteria in the intention to treat analysis (see below)&#xD;
      more than 80 people will be included to calculate for drop outs. The same principle for bloc&#xD;
      randomization as describe above will be followed creating additional blocs with four&#xD;
      participants in each. If more than 16 men are included they will continue receiving numbers&#xD;
      from 81. For the likelihood to demonstrate an effect of PTX on the cardiovascular risk in&#xD;
      PHPT patients, the analysis will be restricted only to the population that obtain a normal&#xD;
      p-calcium after PTX.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aarhus University Hospital is the primary center for diagnostic and treatment of PHPT in the&#xD;
      Region of Central Denmark. Hence, all referred patients with possible PHPT will be contacted&#xD;
      during their hospital visit. Participants fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for PHPT will be&#xD;
      asked for participation in the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHPT is defined as elevated p-calcium of minimum 3 measurements and parathyroid hormone in&#xD;
      the upper one-third of or above the reference range.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires: Height and weight will be measured on all participants. Additional&#xD;
      information about each participant will be collected through interview/questionnaires which&#xD;
      concerns: previous and current diseases, history of fractures, smoking status, consumption of&#xD;
      alcohol and use of medications. Medications covers all prescribed medication, calcium and&#xD;
      vitamin-D supplementation and natural medicine. Regarding females we will collect information&#xD;
      about age at menarche, pregnancy, labour, menopause, and previous and current use of hormonal&#xD;
      contraceptives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For assessment of quality of life all participants will be asked to fill out 36-Item Short&#xD;
      Form Survey (SF-36) either in written form or online at baseline and at 3-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood pressure: After 5 minutes of rest in sitting position BP will be measured in both right&#xD;
      and left upper arm. Recorded BP will be measured in the arm with the lowest BP with three&#xD;
      following measurement performed with 2 minutes rest in between. The average of the last 2&#xD;
      measurement will be recorded. Furthermore, a 24-hour BP measurement will be performed on each&#xD;
      participant in the non-dominant arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tonometry: In a supine position after 10 minutes of rest PP and PWV are assessed using the&#xD;
      SphygmoCor system (AtCor Medical, cuff-based system) with applanation tonometry. The test&#xD;
      will be performed on fasting participants in the morning both at baseline and at follow up to&#xD;
      avoid diurnal variation. A cuff is placed around right thigh while measurements will be&#xD;
      performed on the right carotid arterial. The carotid-femoral PWV is estimated as the distance&#xD;
      traveled divided by transit time. A minimum of 2 readings are performed and where there is&#xD;
      more than 0.5 m/s difference in the two measurements a three one is performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biochemistry: Blood samples will be collected in the morning fasting, through a venepuncture,&#xD;
      at baseline and at 3-month follow-up. The concentrations of albumin, total and ionized&#xD;
      calcium, creatinine, hbA1C, total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides, P-PTH, P-25(OH)D will&#xD;
      subsequent be determine. Plasma will be frozen down for later analysis of apolipoprotein&#xD;
      (Apo-A and Apo-B), high-sensitive CRP, interleukin-6, TNF-alfa, VCAM-1, fibrinogen, von&#xD;
      Willebrand factor and CD40L.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistic:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The difference between the two groups will be assessed using either a paired t-test or&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney U-test depending on distribution for continuous variables. Pearson's&#xD;
      correlations coefficient will be used to determine relationships between variables.&#xD;
      Multiple-linear regression analysis with PWV, PP and BT as the dependents variables will be&#xD;
      performed adjusting for age, BP, height, smoking status, BMI, anti-hypertensive medications&#xD;
      and hyperlipidaemia. With a sample size of 40 participants in each group the study has an 84&#xD;
      % power to detect a significant difference in PWV of 1 m/s between treatment and control&#xD;
      groups. This is under the assumptions that a healthy person have a mean PWV of 8.4 m/s and a&#xD;
      standard deviation of 1.5 m/s. Assuming a mean arterial blood pressure of 91 (±8) mm Hg, a&#xD;
      sample size of 40 participants in each group will allow for a 80 % statistical power to&#xD;
      detect a between group difference of 5 mm Hg (p&lt;0.05).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the analysis only will be restricted to the participants in the EPTX group obtaining&#xD;
      normal p-calcium, we will aim to recruit 80-100 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical aspects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is performed under the current guidelines developed in the Helsinki-declaration&#xD;
      concerning research with humans. Participants will be informed orally and in written about&#xD;
      the project's aim, execution and possible side effects. The project is entirely voluntarily&#xD;
      and the participants can withdraw their consent anytime during the study, without any&#xD;
      reasons. It will not affect their ongoing and future treatments if a participants decide to&#xD;
      withdraw. Only participants given full consent orally and in written will be enrolled in the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The waiting period for a PTX operation at the Aarhus University Hospital is normally 2-3&#xD;
      month and therefore the enrolled participants in the control group will maximum wait an extra&#xD;
      2-4 week. As PHPT most often is a disease which develops over several years, postponement of&#xD;
      the treatment by surgery for a few weeks in the LPTX-group is not presumed to carry any risk&#xD;
      for the participants.&#xD;
