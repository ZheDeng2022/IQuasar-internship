  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if an investigational treatment (teduglutide) is&#xD;
      safe and effective in Japanese children (age 4 months through 15 years of age) with SBS who&#xD;
      are dependent on parenteral support. This study will also evaluate how teduglutide moves&#xD;
      through the body (pharmacokinetics) and how it affects the body (pharmacodynamics).&#xD;
