      The study is designed as a single center, post-market, non-randomized, open-label,&#xD;
      observational clinical study with retrospective and prospective enrollment to evaluate the&#xD;
      2-year post implantation survivorship of the PyroTITAN™ HRA device following the&#xD;
      implementation of a new proof test to identify and eliminate devices with sub-standard&#xD;
      mechanical integrity.&#xD;

      The study is designed as a single center, post-market, non-randomized, open-label,&#xD;
      observational clinical study with retrospective and prospective enrollment to evaluate the&#xD;
      2-year post implantation survivorship of the PyroTITAN™ HRA device following the&#xD;
      implementation of a new proof test to identify and eliminate devices with sub-standard&#xD;
      mechanical integrity. The results will be compared to data collected in a prior study&#xD;
      conducted before implementing the new proof test. The PyroTITAN™ HRA Shoulder prosthesis&#xD;
      device configuration will include humeral resurfacing CAP without cement. Patients will be&#xD;
      selected retrospectively and prospectively for recruitment into the study based upon the&#xD;
      normally accepted criteria for primary shoulder resurfacing arthroplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      137 subjects with PyroTITAN™ HRA Shoulder prosthesis arthroplasties will be implanted and&#xD;
      followed for up to 60 months.&#xD;
