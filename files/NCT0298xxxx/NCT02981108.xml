  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2, open-label, multicenter study of HS-10296 with dose escalation, dose&#xD;
      expansion and extension cohorts in locally advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer&#xD;
      (NSCLC) patients who have progressed following prior therapy with an epidermal growth factor&#xD;
      receptor(EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) agent. The study is designed to evaluate&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and anti-tumor activity of once-daily and orally&#xD;
      (PO) administered HS-10296. The overall study design is shown in the flow chart below, which&#xD;
      consists of 3 phases: dose escalation, dose expansion and extension cohort.&#xD;

             procedures, sampling, and analyses. If a patient declines to participate in any&#xD;
             voluntary exploratory research and/or genetic component of the study, there will be no&#xD;
             penalty or loss of benefit to the patient and he/she will not be excluded from other&#xD;
             aspects of the study.&#xD;

                  EGFR TKI sensitivity (including G719X, exon 19 deletion, L858R, L861Q) OR must&#xD;
                  have experienced clinical benefit from EGFR TKI, according to the Jackman&#xD;
                  criteria (followed by systemic objective progression (RECIST or World Health&#xD;

&#xD;
          6. For the dose expansion and extension cohorts, patients also must have confirmation of&#xD;
             tumor T790M+ mutation status from a biopsy sample taken after disease progression on&#xD;

             for biopsy during the study Screening period,and that can be accurately measured at&#xD;
             Baseline as ≥ 10mm in the longest diameter (except lymph nodes which must have short&#xD;
             axis ≥ 15mm) with computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),&#xD;
             which is suitable for accurately repeated measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Females of child-bearing potential should be using adequate contraceptive measures&#xD;
             throughout the study, should not be breast feeding at the time of screening, during&#xD;
             the study and until 3 months after completion of study, and must have a negative&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Treatment with any of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  An EGFR TKI (e.g., erlotinib, gefitinib, or osimertinib) within 8 days or&#xD;
                  approximately 5 times the half-life of the specific drug, whichever is longer, of&#xD;
                  the first dose of study treatment. (If sufficient wash-out time has not occurred&#xD;
                  due to scheduling or PK properties, an alternative appropriate wash-out time&#xD;
                  based on known duration and time to reversibility of drug-related adverse events&#xD;
                  must be agreed upon by Hansoh and the Investigator).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Any cytotoxic chemotherapy, investigational agents, or anticancer drugs for&#xD;
                  advanced NSCLC used for a previous treatment regimen or clinical study within 14&#xD;
                  days of the first dose of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Major surgery (excluding placement of vascular access) within 4 weeks of the&#xD;
                  first dose of study treatment.&#xD;

                  the first dose of study treatment, with the exception of patients receiving&#xD;
                  radiation to more than 30% of the bone marrow or with a wide field of radiation&#xD;
                  which must be completed within 4 weeks of the first dose of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Previously untreated NSCLC patients. To be eligible for this study, patients must have&#xD;
             received and progressed on EGFR TKI therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Any unresolved toxicities from prior therapy greater than Common Terminology Criteria&#xD;
             for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Grade 1, at the time of starting study treatment with the&#xD;
             exception of alopecia and Grade 2, prior platinum-therapy related neuropathy.&#xD;

             compliance with the protocol such as active infection (e.g., hepatitis B, hepatitis C&#xD;
             or human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]). Screening for chronic conditions is not&#xD;
             required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Any of the following cardiac criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Mean resting corrected QT interval (QTc) &gt; 470 msec obtained from 3&#xD;

                  events such as heart failure, hypokalemia, congenital long QT syndrome, family&#xD;
                  history of long QT syndrome or unexplained sudden death under 40 years of age in&#xD;
                  first degree relatives or any concomitant medication known to prolong the QT&#xD;
                  interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Past medical history of interstitial lung disease, drug-induced interstitial lung&#xD;
             disease, radiation pneumonitis which required steroid treatment, or any evidence of&#xD;
             clinically active interstitial lung disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Inadequate bone marrow reserve or organ function as demonstrated by any of the&#xD;

                  demonstrable liver metastases or &gt; 5 times the ULN in the presence of liver&#xD;
                  metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Aspartate aminotransferase &gt; 2.5 times the ULN if no demonstrable liver&#xD;
                  metastases or &gt; 5 times the ULN in the presence of liver metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;

                  (measured or calculated by the Cockcroft - Gault equation); confirmation of&#xD;
                  creatinine clearance is only required when creatinine is &gt; 1.5 times the ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Refractory nausea, vomiting, or chronic gastrointestinal diseases, inability to&#xD;
             swallow the study medication, or previous significant bowel resection that would&#xD;
             preclude adequate absorption of HS-10296.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. History of hypersensitivity to any active or inactive ingredient of HS-10296 or to a&#xD;

             the patient is unlikely to comply with study procedures, restrictions, and&#xD;
             requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Any disease or condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would compromise&#xD;
             the safety of the patient or interfere with study assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. The following are considered criteria for exclusion from the exploratory genetic&#xD;
             research:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Previous allogenic bone marrow transplant.&#xD;
