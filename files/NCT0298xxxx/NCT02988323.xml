  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sport concussions are among the most commonly occurring injuries in sport and recreation and&#xD;
      pose significant public health implications for Canadians. Many individuals who sustain a&#xD;
      concussion recover in the initial 7-10 days but up to 74% of youth and 31% of adults may&#xD;
      suffer from persistent symptoms. Little research is currently available evaluating the&#xD;
      effects of treatment for individuals who are slower to recover following sport-related&#xD;
      concussion. An initial RCT identified a significant treatment effect in individuals with&#xD;
      persistent symptoms of dizziness, neck pain and/or headaches following sport-related&#xD;
      concussion when treated with a combination of cervical and vestibular physiotherapy compared&#xD;
      to a typical protocol of rest followed by graded exertion (Schneider et al, 2014). Low level&#xD;
      aerobic exercise in combination with sport specific training may also be of benefit to&#xD;
      facilitate recovery in children and youth following concussion (Gagnon et al, 2009, 2016).&#xD;
      Further evaluation of these treatments is required to better understand the effects of each&#xD;
      treatment in isolation and in combination. This trial will have the ability to inform future&#xD;
      multifaceted clinical trials as well as clinical practice. Ultimately, identification of&#xD;
      optimal treatment paradigms will lead to a decrease in persistent symptoms and functional&#xD;
      alterations in children and youth from this commonly occurring injury.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although awareness regarding sport-related concussion is growing, rehabilitative strategies&#xD;
      for this commonly occuring injury have been a focus of very little research. With the&#xD;
      exception of our pilot RCT, no RCTs to date have evaluated the efficacy of cervical spine&#xD;
      physiotherapy in combination with vestibular rehabilitation in sport-related concussion.&#xD;
      Current evidence has suggested positive effects of low-level aerobic exercise in youth and&#xD;
      adults who are slow to recover following a concussion (Gagnon et al, 2016). However,&#xD;
      low-level aerobic exercise has not yet been compared to cervicovestibular physiotherapy. A&#xD;
      shift in clinical practice (to implement cervicovestibular physiotherapy or low level aerobic&#xD;
      exercise) is occurring, but a direct comparison of the effects of low level aerobic exercise&#xD;
      and multimodal physiotherapy treatment has not yet been conducted. A combination of these two&#xD;
      forms of treatment may be more beneficial than either in isolation. Thus, the combination of&#xD;
      physiotherapy and low level aerobic exercise treatment also requires evaluation.&#xD;
      Identification of management strategies for individuals with persistent symptoms following&#xD;
      concussion is urgently required to inform practice and optimize treatment strategies in this&#xD;
      commonly occuring health problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Research Question:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Does cervical and vestibular rehabilitation (CVPT) 1) result in a greater proportion of&#xD;
      individuals medically cleared to return to sport (yes/no); 2) improve quality of life&#xD;
      compared to a control group of low level aerobic exercise (LLAE) (following an 8-week&#xD;
      intervention in individuals with persistent symptoms of dizziness, neck pain and/or headaches&#xD;
      following concussion)?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Research Questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Does a combination of CVPT and LLAE 1) result in a greater proportion of individuals&#xD;
      medically cleared to return to sport; 2) Improve quality of life compared to CVPT or LLAE&#xD;
      alone (following an 8-week intervention in individuals with persistent symptoms of dizziness,&#xD;
      neck pain and/or headaches following concussion)?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Research Questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Does cervical and vestibular rehabilitation (CVPT) result in a greater proportion of&#xD;
           individuals medically cleared to return to sport compared to a control group of low&#xD;
           level aerobic exercise (LLAE) (following an 8-week intervention in individuals with&#xD;
           persistent symptoms of dizziness, neck pain and/or headaches following concussion) when&#xD;
           stratified by subgroups based on time since injury, previous history of concussion, sex&#xD;
           and age?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Does a combination of CVPT and LLAE result in a greater proportion of individuals&#xD;
           medically cleared to return to sport compared to CVPT or LLAE alone when stratified by&#xD;
           subgroups based on time since injury, previous history of concussion, sex and age?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. What clinical characteristics predict response to treatment?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. What changes in symptoms and clinical measures of cervical and vestibular function occur&#xD;
           with treatment?&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. What changes in measures of disability, self-efficacy, neuropsychological and&#xD;
           psychosocial function occur with treatment?&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. What other factors may affect treatment outcome (i.e. medical clearance) and quality of&#xD;
           life in youth with persisting symptoms following concussion?&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design is a single blind randomized controlled trial (RCT). Participants will be&#xD;
      recruited through the University of Calgary Acute Sport Concussion Clinic and through&#xD;
      community sport medicine offices, family physicians and allied health in the City of Calgary&#xD;
      and surrounding areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will undergo an initial physiotherapy assessment at inclusion into the&#xD;
      study. This assessment will be repeated at the time of medical clearance to return to sport&#xD;
      (if less than 8 weeks) or at 8 weeks following initiation of treatment. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomized into a cervicovestibular physiotherapy intervention (CVPT) group, a low level&#xD;
      aerobic exercise group (LLAE), or a combination of cervicovestibular physiotherapy and low&#xD;
      level aerobic exercise group (combination). All study participants will meet weekly (30&#xD;
      minute appointment) with a study physiotherapist for eight weeks (or until the time of&#xD;
      medical clearance to return to sport if clearance occurs prior to 8 weeks). All groups will&#xD;
      follow a protocol of graded exertion as per the 4th International Consensus Guidelines&#xD;
      (Zurich 2012, McCrory et al, 2013).&#xD;

    <description>The primary outcomes of interest will be: 1) Medical clearance to return to sport by 8-weeks (as per the 4th International Consensus Guidelines on Concussion in Sport). Medical clearance was selected because it is the most clinically relevant measure and will reflect not only symptom resolution but also functional improvement. We have chosen to further standardize this outcome as follows to minimize risk of bias:&#xD;
Asymptomatic a rest&#xD;
Able to complete all steps of the return to play protocol with no recurrence of symptoms&#xD;
Able to return to school full time without accommodations&#xD;
No other clinical findings suggesting an inability to return to play Some individuals may choose not to return to sport (i.e. retire) or to have coaching decisions influence their return to sport (i.e. may return prior to medical clearance). Therefore, medical clearance to return to sport (as opposed to actual return) is felt to most accurately reflect recovery.</description>

    <description>In addition to the standard protocol of rest followed by exertion, the CV PT group will participate in a combination of cervical spine and vestibular rehabilitation as per a standardized treatment algorithm based on individual assessment findings. This form of therapy combines treatment techniques for both the cervical spine and vestibular system that are commonly used in physiotherapy practice. Cervical spine treatments may include neuromotor retraining, sensorimotor retraining, manual therapy, soft tissue techniques, and range of motion exercises. Vestibular rehabilitation may include gaze stabilization, habituation, standing balance, dynamic balance and canalith repositioning maneouvers.</description>

    <description>Participants will exercise at 60% maximum heart rate for 15 minutes. This heart rate will be calculated by taking 220-age (in years) and multiplying by 0.6 to determine the target heart rate while performing the low level aerobic exercise. Aerobic exercises may include treadmill, walking or stationary cycling. Exercise will be performed 5-6 times per week independently at home and monitored by their parents. Individuals will be taught how to monitor their heart rate. This protocol has previously been found to be feasible and of minimal risk to participants.</description>
