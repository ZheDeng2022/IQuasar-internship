  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent changes in medical training environments and restrictive work-hour regulations have&#xD;
      greatly impacted trainees, limiting the number of opportunities to gain proficiency in&#xD;
      procedural skills. Reports suggest that medical residents lack confidence in their ability to&#xD;
      perform certain medical procedures, and program directors often do not believe their&#xD;
      residents can operate independently in major procedures. Simulator based task training (SBTT)&#xD;
      has provided a safe and ethically appropriate method of skill acquisition but training&#xD;
      opportunities remain limited. Methods to enhance motor learning during these training&#xD;
      opportunities have not been described. Transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) is an&#xD;
      emerging form of non-invasive brain stimulation that has been shown to improve motor&#xD;
      learning. tDCS has been shown to enhance increasingly complex skill acquisition. The&#xD;
      investigators propose to examine if tDCS can improve the acquisition and retention of&#xD;
      neurosurgical skill. The investigators propose a double blind, sham-controlled randomized&#xD;
      trial applying tDCS during evidence-based SBTT of medical students, to determine if brain&#xD;
      stimulation can enhance training skill acquisition and retention. Even a modest enhancement&#xD;
      carries the potential to transform medicosurgical skills training.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Rationale: Recent changes in medical training environments have resulted in many trainees&#xD;
      lacking sufficient opportunity to acquire specific skills necessary for their specialty. New&#xD;
      methods to enhance the acquisition and retention of medical and surgical skills are required&#xD;
      to ensure the quality of the future physician workforce. Transcranial direct-current&#xD;
      stimulation (tDCS) is an emerging method of non-invasive brain stimulation that has been show&#xD;
      to safely enhance motor learning in adults and children. Even a modest enhancement of&#xD;
      acquisition and retention of medical-surgical skill with tDCS carries the potential to&#xD;
      accelerate skill training for health care providers, thereby contributing to greater training&#xD;
      efficiency and improved patient outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The objective of this study is to assess whether tDCS can enhance the acquisition&#xD;
      and retention of neurosurgical ability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics:This study has been approval by the University of Calgary Research Ethics Board&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Randomized, double blind, sham-controlled trial to evaluate the ability of tDCS to&#xD;
      enhance learning and retention of neurosurgical skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcranial Direct-Current Stimulation: The tDCS methods used are based on best-available&#xD;
      evidence and practices, and will be applied in a standardized fashion by experienced&#xD;
      investigators. Anodal tDCS will be delivered through saline-soaked sponge electrodes using a&#xD;
      NeuroConn Direct-Current Stimulator (NeuroConn, Ilmenau, Germany). The anode will be centered&#xD;
      over the left primary motor cortex (localized using the 10-20 EEG System), with the cathode&#xD;
      over the contralateral supraorbital area. Both anodal and sham tDCS groups will have the&#xD;
      current ramped-up to 1milliamp over 30 seconds. In the anodal tDCS group, the current will be&#xD;
      held for 20 minutes. In the sham tDCS condition, the current will be held for only 60 seconds&#xD;
      (no changes in cortical excitability) followed by a 30 second ramp-down.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Medical students (years 1-3) from the Cumming School of Medicine (University of&#xD;
      Calgary) will be recruited. To ensure comparable baseline skills, trainees will be excluded&#xD;
      if they have undergone formal neurosurgical training in the past 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculations are based on the performance measures for the percentage of virtual&#xD;
      tumor resected, determined through pilot studies. Based on 20% more tumor being resected at&#xD;
      post-training, power of 90% and type-1 error of 0.05, the investigators estimate a sample&#xD;
      size of a minimum of 24 participants (n=12 per stimulation condition).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: A short questionnaire will be completed to determine demographic&#xD;
      characteristics, including: gender, age, level of training, how many times participants have&#xD;
      performed on a virtual surgical simulator, how often participants play video games, and how&#xD;
      often participants play a musical instrument.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited at the Project NeuroArm Laboratory (University of Calgary) and&#xD;
      be oriented to the workspace. Participants will complete virtual tumor resections on a&#xD;
      NeuroTouch (National Research Council of Canada) surgical simulator. Participants will view a&#xD;
      standardized training video, created by an expert in neurosurgery, demonstrating a virtual&#xD;
      tumor resection using the simulator. Participant will have 3 minutes to resect a virtual&#xD;
      tumor, avoiding resection of healthy tissue. Recorded outcome metrics will include: % tumor&#xD;
      resected, volume of healthy tissue resected, time of excessive force on tumor and time of&#xD;
      excessive force on healthy tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will perform one resection at baseline, establishing baseline skill.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to receive sham or active tDCS by blinding selecting a code&#xD;
      from the envelope, corresponding to a particular stimulation condition. Participants will&#xD;
      perform eight training repetitions, taking approximately 30 minutes. Following approximately&#xD;
      30 minutes of training (eight training repetitions) the tDCS electrodes will be removed, and&#xD;
      a final resection will be performed. Six weeks following the training the participants will&#xD;
      return to assess retention of skill, performing a single resection. Emerging evidence&#xD;
      suggests that a significant decay in surgical skill is present six weeks following training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis: Independent samples t-test will evaluate difference in outcome metrics at&#xD;
      post-training between stimulation conditions. Two-way repeated-measures ANOVA for factors&#xD;
      &quot;stimulation type&quot; and &quot;training block&quot; will explore the interaction between tDCS and&#xD;
      training for each outcome metric. Retention of skill will be assessed using a paired t-test&#xD;
      for each stimulation group.&#xD;
