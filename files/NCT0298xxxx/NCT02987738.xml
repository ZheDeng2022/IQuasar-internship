  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dapagliflozin has a unique mechanism of action that does not directly affect either insulin&#xD;
      resistance or insulin secretion, but rather improves glycemia by reduction of glucose&#xD;
      re-absorption from proximal renal tubules. Dapagliflozin is expected to reduce mean daily&#xD;
      glucose, improve glycemic control and reduce overall insulin requirements. Improved glycemic&#xD;
      control with reduced variability may also lead to reduced frequency of hypoglycemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In youth with T1D, Dapagliflozin led to a significant reduction of insulin needed to achieve&#xD;
      target glucose irrespective of preexisting HbA1c levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this pilot study data will be collected to investigate the effect on glucose of two doses&#xD;
      of 10mg (each) dapagliflozin within range for the ensuing 24 hours during the DreaMed&#xD;
      automated insulin delivery in patients with type 1 diabetes dosing with dapagliflozin in an&#xD;
      in-patient setting combined with an automated sensor based CE marked insulin delivery system&#xD;
      to data if dapagliflozin is a suitable add-on therapy. This will provide optimal monitoring&#xD;
      of subject safety and assessment of the effects of dapagliflozin in a structured setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If this inpatient study shows evidence that Dapagliflozin is a suitable add on therapy and&#xD;
      leads to an increase of time within the target glucose range when using a sensor based&#xD;
      insulin pump therapy (closed-loop) further outpatient studies are planned to be conducted.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to collect clinical data of two doses of 10mg (each)&#xD;
      dapagliflozin as add-on to night and day closed-loop control using the DreaMed automated&#xD;
      insulin delivery on the time [%] within glucose range 70-180 mg/dl (3.9-10mmol/l) for the&#xD;
      ensuing 24 hours with two oral mixed-meals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aimed to patients who have different degrees of inadequate glycemic control despite&#xD;
      insulin use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A maximum of 45 patients will be screened until 30 Type 1 Diabetes mellitus patient (15&#xD;
      adults, 15 adolescents) will completed the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will consist of six visits: a screening visit (Visit 1), two dosing visits (Visit 2&#xD;
      and Visit 4), two phone visits (Visit 3 and Visit 5) and a follow-up visit (Visit 6).&#xD;
      Furthermore, an information visit will take place prior to the screening visit in order to&#xD;
      obtain patient's informed consent. Screening will take place 2-21 days prior to Visit 2 and&#xD;
      the follow-up visit will take place 5-21 days after the end of Visit 4. The dosing visits&#xD;
      will be separated by a wash-out period (5-30 days between the end of Visit 2 and begin of&#xD;
      Visit 4) during which the subjects will resume their normal insulin treatment. Each phone&#xD;
      visit (Visit 3 and Visit 5) will take place 3-5 days after the end of dosing Visits 2 and 4.&#xD;
      The planned total duration of the trial is 18-78 days per subject (rescheduled visits&#xD;
      excluded). Each subject will be randomised to a treatment sequence consisting of two&#xD;
      treatment periods in which the subjects will receive 2 times 10mg dapagliflozin and placebo&#xD;
      on two separate dosing visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects metabolic control will be achieved by using the DreaMed system (closed loop). The&#xD;
      procedure will be used in order to aim and maintain blood glucose levels between 70 and 180&#xD;
      mg/dl thereby.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two standardized mixed-meals will be given 12 hours and 18 hours after dosing. Blood glucose&#xD;
      measurements will be performed every 30min for 120min after the mixed-meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples for determination of dapagliflozin concentration in serum will be taken 14times&#xD;
      in 24hours as well as ß-Hydroxybutyrate and every urine sample will be collected for 24 hours&#xD;
      after first dosing for the determination of 24hour urinary glucose and creatinine for&#xD;
      efficacy measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition a full blood gas analysis will be drawn if an elevated β-hydroxybutyrate of &gt;1.0&#xD;
      mmol/L will be detected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      24 hours after first dosing with dapagliflozin/ placebo of each dosing visit the subjects&#xD;
      will resume their usual insulin treatment and can leave the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After conclusion of the trial the documented insulin doses over time will be summed up for&#xD;
      calculation of the total insulin dose and the insulin dose per kg body weight per 24 hours.&#xD;
