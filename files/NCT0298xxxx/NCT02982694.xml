  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the anti-tumor activity, as measured by&#xD;
      overall response rate (ORR) of atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab in patients with&#xD;
      chemotherapy resistant CRC and positivity for MSI-like molecular signature. This is an&#xD;
      international, open-label single arm (non-randomized), one-stage phase II trial.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    The results of the interim analysis showed that the efficacy in the MSS subgroup (MSI like) is&#xD;
    inferior to the expected, and this situation is very unlikely to be reversed if the trial is&#xD;
    fully completed.&#xD;
