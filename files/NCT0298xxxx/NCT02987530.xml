      The purpose of this study is to compare the impact of two combination of two tablets once&#xD;
      daily: dolutegravir associated with emtricitabine / tenofovir versus darunavir / cobicistat&#xD;
      associated with emtricitabine / tenofovir on DNA HIV measured in PBMC at 48 weeks in patients&#xD;
      with primary HIV-1 infection.&#xD;

      Phase III, randomized (1: 1), comparative, superiority, open-label, parallel assignment,&#xD;
      national multicenter trial evaluating two treatments in patients with primary HIV-1&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;

      Comparison of the two combinations regarding:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Viral reservoir at W48&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Early inhibition of viral replication,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Plasmatic and cellular cumulative viremia at W48,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Immune reconstitution with CD4, CD8 levels and CD4 / CD8 ratio,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Activation parameters decrease,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adherence to treatments,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatments tolerance,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse events,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of life (by self-administered questionnaires). Study of the pharmacokinetics /&#xD;
           dynamics relationship of the decay of plasma, cellular and spermatic compartments' viral&#xD;
           loads.&#xD;
&#xD;
           50 participants per group will be enrolled in 40 sites in France. Co- inclusion in ANRS&#xD;
