    <textblock>
      Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To evaluate the pharmacodynamic effects on metabolic endpoints (malonyl carnitine and&#xD;
      tripalmitin levels) following short-term treatment with TVB-2640 in patients with resectable&#xD;
      cancers&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if short-term treatment with TVB-2640 decreases cancer cell proliferation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine other biological endpoints and determine if TVB-2640 inhibits cell survival&#xD;
           signaling and lipid biogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To perform comprehensive metabolomic analysis in tumor tissues to identify metabolic&#xD;
           alterations induced by TVB-2640 treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To correlate FASN levels in tumor with metabolic and biological endpoints to determine&#xD;
           if FASN inhibition has more pronounced effects in patients with increased expression.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the hypothesis that inhibition of FASN activity blocks tumor lipid&#xD;
      biosynthesis and alters the cellular metabolism in colon and other resectable cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pharmacodynamic study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Potentially eligible patients will be screened in the University of Kentucky Markey&#xD;
           Cancer Center clinics. Eligible patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed&#xD;
           resectable cancers without any distant metastases will be identified. Upon obtaining&#xD;
           informed consent, patients will be enrolled into the study and randomized to TVB-2640 or&#xD;
           placebo in a 2:1 fashion. Subjects and clinical investigators will be blinded to&#xD;
           treatment group assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline blood samples will be collected on Day 0 for all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All enrolled patients will receive the study drug (TVB-2640 or placebo) at a BSA-derived&#xD;
           flat dose, orally once daily, starting Day 1. They will receive the study drug for 10-21&#xD;
           days (minimum of 10 days and a maximum of 21 days), i.e. from Day 1 to Day 10-21. The&#xD;
           last dose of the study drug will be on the day before the surgical resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For patients in both randomization groups, surgery will be performed anytime during the&#xD;
           window of Day 11- Day 22. On the day of surgery, surgical resection specimen and blood&#xD;
           samples will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients will be evaluated and graded for adverse events according to the NCI Common&#xD;
           Terminology for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.03.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be followed for 4 weeks after the last dose of the study drug to monitor&#xD;
           for any drug-related adverse events.&#xD;
