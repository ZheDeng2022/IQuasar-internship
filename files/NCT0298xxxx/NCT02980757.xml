  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to assess comparative bioavailability of two test&#xD;
      formulations of Gliclazide 120 mg Modified Release tablets (120 mg gliclazide per modified&#xD;
      release tablet) Manufactured By Indeus Life Sciences Pvt. Ltd., Mumbai India (An Affiliate Of&#xD;
      Disphar International B.V., The Netherlands) Relative To DIAMICRON MR® 60 mg 2 × (60 mg&#xD;
      gliclazide per modified release tablet) Of Les Laboratories Servier Industrie, France in 15&#xD;
      healthy adult subjects under fasting conditions. The second aim is to asses the safety of&#xD;
      subjects and to determine other pharmacokinetic data.&#xD;
