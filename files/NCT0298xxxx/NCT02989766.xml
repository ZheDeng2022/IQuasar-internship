    <textblock>
      This intervention would be a series of self-help-style educational and motivational activity&#xD;
      sheets for patients to complete independently. This will be a randomized clinical control&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will complete a pre delivery questionnaire and a postpartum questionnaire. Subjects&#xD;
      in the intervention arm will complete 3 activity sheets prenatally during their wait time at&#xD;
      the clinic. The first worksheet can be completed the day of recruitment after consent is&#xD;
      signed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be contacted by phone at 3 and 6 months postpartum to assess long term duration&#xD;
      of breast feeding.&#xD;

      As the benefits of human milk become evident, the investigators are striving to improve the&#xD;
      breastfeeding (BF) rate among new mothers. In April and May of 2014, 73 (71%) of well babies&#xD;
      received human milk at discharge from our postpartum unit, with 40 (35%) and receiving human&#xD;
      milk exclusively. In the neonatal intensive care unit, 83 (89%) received human milk during&#xD;
      those months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many of the patients at the teaching institution share risk factors for failure to BF,&#xD;
      including poverty, obesity, unplanned pregnancy and being African American. Efforts have had&#xD;
      limited effect in improving initiation and duration among these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies examining the efficacy of various modalities of antenatal education produced modest&#xD;
      results in improving initiation and duration of BF. Several studies examined group BF&#xD;
      education versus routine prenatal care without significant differences in initiation,&#xD;
      exclusivity (the practice of using human milk exclusively and not supplementing with formula)&#xD;
      or duration. Conversely, other study showed a difference in initiation with group education&#xD;
      and showed a difference in exclusivity. Formalized education compared to routine clinical&#xD;
      practice education did not result in a difference in exclusivity in several studies and&#xD;
      neither did a program that included a video showed a difference in initiation with formal&#xD;
      education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A few studies compared peer counseling to routine prenatal care. One small study of 59 women&#xD;
      found an increase in initiation rate, while a larger study of 2511 women did not find a&#xD;
      difference in initiation or duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other studies found no significant difference in initiation, duration or exclusivity with an&#xD;
      educational program on practical BF skills nor a program on BF attitudes. A small study that&#xD;
      paired BF education with material incentives increased exclusivity. Three studies comparing&#xD;
      interventions by lactation consultants found no difference in initiation or duration,&#xD;
      although one study showed improvement in exclusivity. Postpartum BF self-efficacy correlates&#xD;
      with BF duration and two studies showed improvement in exclusivity with a BF class based on&#xD;
      principles of self-efficacy. These studies based their intervention on Bandura's theory of&#xD;
      self-efficacy, which proposes that an individual's expectation of personal efficacy will&#xD;
      determine her initiation of coping behavior, effort expenditure and duration of persistence.&#xD;
      This theory recognizes four components that contribute to an individual's sense of self-&#xD;
      efficacy, and these include performance accomplishment, vicarious, or social, experience,&#xD;
      verbal persuasion and psychological state. developed a validated scale at measuring prenatal&#xD;
      maternal self-efficacy in breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These two studies used a teaching approach that assumes that pregnant women are adults who&#xD;
      are self-motivated and have past experience that shapes their learning and are a component to&#xD;
      their perception of self-efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Printed self-help materials are appealing as a low cost intervention that could be widely&#xD;
      implemented. Furthermore, a large study among pregnant women showed that a self-help guide&#xD;
      that is particularly tailored towards pregnant women could be effective in promoting another&#xD;
      healthy behavior modification: smoking cessation. Potentially this method could be effective&#xD;
      when used to prepare mothers for breastfeeding.&#xD;
