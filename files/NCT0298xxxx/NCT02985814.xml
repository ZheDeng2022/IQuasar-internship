      Background: Asthma and COPD are considered different diseases but many patients share&#xD;
      characteristics of both entities. This has been termed &quot;COPD-asthma overlap syndrome&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study objective: To examine: (a) the frequency of the overlap phenotype among patients&#xD;
      referred for pulmonary function testing and, (b) the impact of this phenotype on the&#xD;
      therapeutic management and the quality of life of these patients as compared with patients&#xD;
      with COPD only and asthma only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type of study: Observational, cross-sectional. Study subjects: Patients referred for&#xD;
      pulmonary function test diagnosed with airway obstruction (FEV1/FVC &lt; 0.7) willing to sign an&#xD;
      informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures: Spirometry will be performed before and after the administration of a&#xD;
      bronchodilator. Respiratory questionnaire: Questionnaires about smoking habits, past history&#xD;
      of asthma and wheezing, current medications and history of exacerbations will be administered&#xD;
      at inclusion. Questionnaire on medication utilization will be administered by telephone one&#xD;
      month after inclusion. Quality of life: Will be assessed using the Saint George Respiratory&#xD;
      Questionnaire (SGRQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Working definitions: The following definitions will be adopted: a) COPD only: smoking history&#xD;
      &gt; 10 pack/years and post-bronchodilator (BD) FEV1/FVC ratio of &lt; 0.70; b) Asthma only: (1)&#xD;
      presence of wheezing in the last year plus a minimum post-BD increase in FEV1 or FVC of 12%&#xD;
      and 200 ml; (2) prior physician diagnosis (before age 40); and c) both COPD-Asthma (the&#xD;
      overlap group) - the combination of the two.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: The clinical outcome is the prevalence rate of the phenotypes.&#xD;
      Patient-reported outcomes will include the utilization of medication, the number of&#xD;
      exacerbations, and quality of life.&#xD;

      and 200 ml; (2) prior physician diagnosis (before age 40); and c) both COPD-Asthma (the&#xD;
      overlap group) - the combination of the two.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: The clinical outcome is the prevalence rate of the phenotypes.&#xD;
      Patient-reported outcomes will include the utilization of medication, the number of&#xD;
      exacerbations, and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical plan: Sample size: For an estimated prevalence rate of 20%, 246 patients should&#xD;
      be recruited with 5% imprecision and 95% degree of confidence. To round up, 250 patients will&#xD;
      be included. Statistical methods: Multiple comparisons will be carried out using the one-way&#xD;
      ANOVA for continuous variables and chi-squared test (or Fisher Exact Test) for qualitative&#xD;
      variables. Multiple logistic regression models will be tested to examine the relation between&#xD;
      the &quot;COPD-asthma overlap&quot; phenotype and various independent or predictor variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected benefits: Data collected could serve to advance the medical community's knowledge&#xD;
      pertaining to the COPD-asthma overlap syndrome. Most importantly, however, they will&#xD;
      encourage reflection on the best therapeutic options for the patients with the overlap&#xD;
      syndrome. Indeed, recommendations on this matter are noticeably absent from the current&#xD;
      guidelines proposed to treat and monitor obstructive lung diseases.&#xD;
