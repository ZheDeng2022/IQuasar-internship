    <textblock>
      The MR308-3501 study is a multicenter, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group study in male&#xD;
      and female adult subjects to demonstrate the efficacy of MR308 in the treatment of acute&#xD;
      moderate to severe pain after the extraction of at least two third molars requiring bone&#xD;
      removal.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter double-blind, randomised, phase III study in male and female subjects&#xD;
      with acute pain after third molar tooth extraction. The dental procedure must have involved&#xD;
      extraction of at least two impacted third molars requiring bone removal. If only two impacted&#xD;
      third molars are extracted, they must be ipsilateral and both require bone removal under&#xD;
      local anaesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Screening Visit (Visit 1) can take place up to 28 days before the planned third molar&#xD;
      extractions. The randomisation visit (Visit 2) consists of three different sections, a part&#xD;
      before the surgery, the part with the surgery and before randomisation, and a part with the&#xD;
      randomisation and post-randomisation assessments. The visits 3 and 4, one respectively two&#xD;
      days after the randomisation can be performed by telephone if the subject does not&#xD;
      participate in the pharmacokinetic sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The last dose of IMP should be taken by the subject about 72h after the initial dose and&#xD;
      before the Completion/Discontinuation Visit (Visit 5) is performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Adverse Event (AE) Follow-up Visit (Visit 6) is the last study visit and should not be&#xD;
      done earlier than seven days after the subject's last dose of IMP. It can be performed by&#xD;
      telephone.&#xD;

    <measure>Efficacy of MR308 doses in the treatment of moderate to severe acute pain, based on the Sum of Pain Intensity Differences (SPID).</measure>
    <time_frame>0-4 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The primary efficacy endpoint is the Sum of Pain Intensity Differences over 0-4 hours (SPID4). SPID4 is derived as the weighted Sum of Pain Intensity Differences (baseline pain - current pain), measured at different time points via the PI-VAS. Time between two consecutive measurements will be used for weighting. Larger values indicate larger pain relief.</description>

          1. Male/female subjects ≥ 18 years on the day of consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Willing and able to provide written informed consent for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects must have a planned elective dental procedure i.e. extraction of at least two&#xD;
             impacted third molars (one of them must be mandibular) requiring bone removal, within&#xD;
             28 days after the Screening Visit. If only two impacted third molars are extracted,&#xD;

             of contraception throughout the study, not breastfeeding, and have negative pregnancy&#xD;
             tests prior to receiving IMP. A highly effective method of birth control is defined as&#xD;
             one which results in a low failure rate (i.e. less than 1% per year) when used&#xD;
             consistently and correctly such as sterilisation, implants, injectables, combined oral&#xD;
             contraceptives, some IUDs (Intrauterine Device, hormonal), sexual abstinence or&#xD;
             vasectomised partner).&#xD;

&#xD;
          9. Significant neurological or psychiatric disorders including mental instability&#xD;
             (unrelated to the pain) that could interfere with pain assessment; other pain that&#xD;
             might impair the assessment of the nociceptive pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Any medical history of significant and/or inadequately controlled cardiovascular&#xD;
             (uncontrolled high blood pressure, high risk of cardiovascular events, severe heart&#xD;

&#xD;
         11. Previous randomisation in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Subjects who participated in a clinical research study involving a new chemical entity&#xD;
             or an experimental drug within 30 days of study entry (defined as the start of the&#xD;
             Screening Period).&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Subjects who were treated regularly with opioid analgesic or NSAIDs within 30 days&#xD;
             prior to screening or who have received a long-acting NSAID within three days prior to&#xD;
             the start of the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Subjects who have received any analgesic medication (e.g. NSAIDs, oral opioid&#xD;
             preparations etc.) other than short-acting preoperative or intraoperative local&#xD;
             anaesthetic agents within 12 hours before the start of the surgery or peri operatively&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Post-operative medications or treatments that can have an analgesic effect or cause&#xD;
             sedation or have amnesic effect are not permitted as these may interfere with the&#xD;
             study assessments. These include use of ice packs, corticosteroids, nitrous oxide,&#xD;
             benzodiazepines, alcohol, hypnotics, analgesics, opioids, other psychotropic medicinal&#xD;
             products and any other analgesia except the provided study treatments&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. If in the Investigators opinion there are any factors that may confound the analysis&#xD;
             of the study regarding efficacy and safety (e.g. a PI-VAS score greater than 90).&#xD;
