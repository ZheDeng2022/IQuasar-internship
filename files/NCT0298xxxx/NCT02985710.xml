  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sudoscan™ (Impeto Medical, Paris France) uses electrochemical skin conductance as a novel&#xD;
      noninvasive method to detect sudomotor dysfunction. Several small studies have recently shown&#xD;
      that Sudoscan use in the assessment of small fiber polyneuropathy (in diabetes mellitus) can&#xD;
      be performed non-invasively, quickly and effectively. The investigators aim to study the use&#xD;
      of Sudoscan in rare disease condition associated with small fiber polyneuropathy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Small fiber polyneuropathy (SFPN) is diagnosed through a combination of symptoms, signs and&#xD;
      confirmatory diagnostic testing. Nerve conduction studies are not sensitive enough in most of&#xD;
      the cases leaving the ankle skin biopsy with measurement of intraepidermal nerve fiber&#xD;
      density (IENFD) as the main diagnostic tool. Despite its utility and reproducibility, skin&#xD;
      biopsy is invasive, expensive and requires a central laboratory for processing and&#xD;
      interpretation. Quantitative sudomotor axon reflex testing (QSART) is also routinely used for&#xD;
      evaluation of small fiber neuropathy as sudomotor axons can also be involved. This test&#xD;
      however remains technically challenging and requires testing conditions in specialized labs&#xD;
      that are not always suitable for all patients' population. By comparing findings on skin&#xD;
      biopsy and/or QSRT, accepted gold standard for diagnosing SFPN, the investigators seek to&#xD;
      find faster, less-invasive ways to diagnose and monitor small-fiber polyneuropathy in rare&#xD;
      diseases using Sudoscan measurement.&#xD;

    <description>The internal software of the Sudoscan will allow analysis of skin conductance in all patients and quantification into normal or abnormal. Correlation of an abnormal conductance measurement with clinical symptoms and signs of small fiber neuropathy will be evaluated for accuracy of Sudoscan measurements</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Patients in Whom a Specific Skin Conductance (ESC) Signature Pattern Was Detected in the Hands and/or Feet on Sudoscan Measurements.</measure>
    <time_frame>48 months</time_frame>
    <description>Distribution of the electrochemical skin conductance (ESC) in both hands and feet was reviewed as an indirect measure of the subject's capacity to sweat. Normative scales of adult sweat function are preloaded in the device and compared to actual measurements to determine if a subject's sweat response is reduced, which is associated with neuropathy. A positive outcome is the identification of a lower ESC in either hands or feet that distinguishes Fabry disease from other disorders and would be a reflection of the presence of SFPN.</description>

          <title>Small fiber polyneuropathy questionnaire</title>
          <description>The SFPN questionnaire has a one week recall period and is composed of 5 domains: Miscellaneous (10 questions), Sensation (8 questions), Circulation (6 questions), Gastrointestinal (6 questions), Pelvic (4 questions) as well as a pain rating scale and clinical questions. Participants who specifically agreed to respond to the SFPN questionnaire are included and the numbers reported represent the number of participants who have responded to the questionnaire.</description>

        <description>The internal software of the Sudoscan will allow analysis of skin conductance in all patients and quantification into normal or abnormal. Correlation of an abnormal conductance measurement with clinical symptoms and signs of small fiber neuropathy will be evaluated for accuracy of Sudoscan measurements</description>

Skin biopsy: For subjects that give additional consent, skin biopsy will be done in standard fashion under sterile conditions. Assessment of nerve fiber density typically involves a 3-mm punch biopsy of skin from the leg (10 cm above the external malleolus).&#xD;
QSART: QSRT (quantitative sudomotor axon reflex test) testing involves having a technician wipe the subject's arms and leg with alcohol, then tissue to wipe it dry. Electrodes filled with acetylcholine are put on three areas of the leg and one on the wrist, stimulators are turned on and sweat responses are measured.</description>

        <title>Number of Patients in Whom a Specific Skin Conductance (ESC) Signature Pattern Was Detected in the Hands and/or Feet on Sudoscan Measurements.</title>
        <description>Distribution of the electrochemical skin conductance (ESC) in both hands and feet was reviewed as an indirect measure of the subject's capacity to sweat. Normative scales of adult sweat function are preloaded in the device and compared to actual measurements to determine if a subject's sweat response is reduced, which is associated with neuropathy. A positive outcome is the identification of a lower ESC in either hands or feet that distinguishes Fabry disease from other disorders and would be a reflection of the presence of SFPN.</description>
