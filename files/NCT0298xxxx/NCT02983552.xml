    <measure>Mean Change in Amblyopic-eye Visual Acuity (VA) Older Cohort</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The primary objective is to compare the efficacy of 4 weeks of treatment with 1 hour/day of binocular game play 5 days per week plus spectacle correction to treatment with spectacle correction alone (control). Monocular distance visual acuity (VA) in current refractive correction (if required) in each eye by a certified examiner using the Electronic Early Treatment Diabetic Retinoscopy Study (E-ETDRS) visual acuity protocol for children ≥ 7 years on a study-certified acuity tester displaying single surrounded optotypes.&#xD;
For the analyses in the older cohort, the level of VA is measured as letter scores (approximate range: 0 to 97 letters, lower scores indicate poorer VA) and change in VA from baseline is measured in letters (positive values indicate improvement), defined as the difference in letter scores between enrollment and follow-up.&#xD;
Adjusted values have been adjusted for amblyopic-eye visual acuity at randomization.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The treatment effect after 4 weeks in subgroups based on baseline factors will be assessed in exploratory analyses and used to suggest hypotheses for further investigation in future studies. The following baseline factors are of interest: amblyopic-eye VA, stereoacuity, the presence of a tropia at near, and prior amblyopia treatment (other than spectacle correction). In accordance with NIH guidelines, subgroup analyses of treatment effect according to gender and race/ethnicity will be conducted. Positive values for visual acuity change indicate improvement.</description>

             NOTE: Subjects with cycloplegic refractive errors that do not fall within the&#xD;
             requirements above for spectacle correction may be given spectacles at investigator&#xD;
             discretion but must follow the study-specified prescribing guidelines, as detailed&#xD;
             below.&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Spectacle prescribing instructions referenced to the cycloplegic refraction&#xD;
                  completed within the last 7 months:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  SE must be within 0.50D of fully correcting the anisometropia.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  SE must not be under corrected by more than 1.50D SE, and reduction in plus&#xD;
                       sphere must be symmetric in the two eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Cylinder power in both eyes must be within 0.50D of fully correcting the&#xD;
                       astigmatism.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Axis must be within +/- 10 degrees if cylinder power is ≤1.00D, and within&#xD;
                       +/- 5 degrees if cylinder power is &gt;1.00D.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Myopia must not be undercorrected by more than 0.25D or over corrected by&#xD;
                       more than 0.50D SE, and any change must be symmetrical in the two eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Spectacle correction meeting the above criteria must be worn:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  For at least 16 weeks OR until VA stability is documented (defined as &lt;0.1&#xD;
                       logMAR change by the same testing method measured on 2 consecutive exams at&#xD;
                       least 8 weeks apart).&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  For determining VA stability (non-improvement):&#xD;
&#xD;
                         -  The first of two measurements may be made 1) in current spectacles, or&#xD;
                            2) in trial frames with or without cycloplegia or 3) without correction&#xD;
                            (if new correction is prescribed),&#xD;
&#xD;
                         -  The second measurement must be made without cycloplegia in the correct&#xD;
                            spectacles that have been worn for at least 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
                         -  Note: since this determination is a pre-study procedure, the method of&#xD;
                            measuring VA is not mandated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. VA, measured in each eye without cycloplegia in current spectacle correction (if&#xD;
             applicable) within 7 days prior to randomization using the ATS-HOTV VA protocol for&#xD;
             children &lt; 7 years and the E-ETDRS VA protocol for children ≥ 7 years on a&#xD;
             study-approved device displaying single surrounded optotypes, as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. VA in the amblyopic eye 20/40 to 20/200 inclusive (ATS-HOTV) or 33 to 72 letters&#xD;
                  (E-ETDRS)&#xD;

&#xD;
          6. Heterotropia with a near deviation of ≤ 5∆ (measured by SPCT) in habitual correction&#xD;
             (Angles of ocular deviation &gt;5∆ are not allowed because large magnitudes of the&#xD;
             deviation would compromise successful playing of the game.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subject is able to play the Dig Rush game (at least level 3) on the study iPad under&#xD;
             binocular conditions (with red-green glasses). Subject must be able to see both the&#xD;
             red &quot;diggers&quot; and blue &quot;gold carts&quot; when contrast for the non-amblyopic eye is at 20%.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Investigator is willing to prescribe computer game play, or continued spectacle wear&#xD;
             per protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Parent understands the protocol and is willing to accept randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Parent has phone (or access to phone) and is willing to be contacted by Jaeb Center&#xD;
             staff or other study staff.&#xD;

             weeks is not anticipated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Prism in the spectacle correction at time of enrollment (eligible only if prism is&#xD;
             discontinued 2 weeks prior to enrollment).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Myopia greater than -6.00D spherical equivalent in either eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Previous intraocular or refractive surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Any treatment for amblyopia (patching, atropine, Bangerter filter, vision therapy or&#xD;
             previous binocular treatment) during the past 2 weeks. Previous amblyopia therapy is&#xD;
             allowed regardless of type, but must be discontinued at least 2 weeks prior to&#xD;
             enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Ocular co-morbidity that may reduce VA determined by an ocular examination performed&#xD;
             within the past 7 months (Note: nystagmus per se does not exclude the subject if the&#xD;
             above VA criteria are met).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. No Down syndrome or cerebral palsy&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. No severe developmental delay that would interfere with treatment or evaluation (in&#xD;
             the opinion of the investigator). Subjects with mild speech delay or reading and/or&#xD;
             learning disabilities are not excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subject has demonstrated previous low compliance with binocular treatment and/or&#xD;
             spectacle treatment (as assessed informally by the investigator)&#xD;

          <title>Stereoacuity (Seconds of Arc)</title>
          <description>Stereoacuity was tested at near in current refractive correction. Stereoacuity scores (measured as seconds of arc) were calculated based on the Randot Butterfly (scores: 2000, Nil) and Randot Preschool (scores: 800, 400, 200, 100, 60 and 40) stereoacuity test methods as previously described. Lower scores indicate better stereoacuity.&#xD;
A logarithm base 10 transformation was used to convert stereoacuity scores (Nil was assigned a score of 4000) to the log scale to calculate descriptive statistics (reported as seconds of arc).</description>

Monocular distance visual acuity (VA) in current refractive correction (if required) in each eye by a certified examiner using the Electronic Early Treatment Diabetic Retinoscopy Study (E-ETDRS) visual acuity protocol for children ≥ 7 years on a study-certified acuity tester displaying single surrounded optotypes.&#xD;
For the analyses in the older cohort, the level of VA is measured as letter scores (approximate range: 0 to 97 letters, lower scores indicate poorer VA) and change in VA from baseline is measured in letters (positive values indicate improvement), defined as the difference in letter scores between enrollment and follow-up.&#xD;
Adjusted values have been adjusted for amblyopic-eye visual acuity at randomization.</description>

          <population>Two participants (1 per group) were not included with the 8-week visual acuity data. One participant in the control treatment group had visual acuity tested using a non-protocol method and another participant in the binocular treatment group completed the 8-week exam outside of the analysis window (49 to &lt;105 days from randomization).</population>

        <description>Stereoacuity will be tested at near in current refractive correction using the Randot Butterfly and Randot Preschool stereoacuity tests. Stereoacuity scores (measure as seconds of arc) were calculated based on the Randot Butterfly (scores: 2000, Nil) and Randot Preschool stereoacuity (scores: 800, 400, 200, 100, 60 and 40) test methods.&#xD;
Lower scores indicate better stereoacuity. Results of the Randot Butterfly test were analyzed as 2000 seconds of arc (if correct response). Nil was assigned a score of 4000 seconds of arc and was defined as (1) an incorrect response on the butterfly in absence of a correct response on the 800 seconds of arc level of the Randot Preschool stereoacuity test or (2) an incorrect response on the 800 seconds of arc level if the butterfly was not attempted.</description>

        <title>Distribution of Change in Stereoacuity Scores From Baseline</title>
        <description>Stereoacuity was tested at near in current refractive correction. Stereoacuity scores (seconds of arc) were calculated based on the Randot Butterfly (scores: 2000, Nil) and Randot Preschool stereoacuity (scores: 800, 400, 200, 100, 60 and 40) test methods. Lower scores indicate better stereoacuity. Results of the Randot Butterfly test were analyzed as 2000 (if correct response). Nil (4000) was defined as (1) an incorrect response on the butterfly in absence of a correct response on the 800 seconds of arc level of the Randot Preschool stereoacuity test or (2) an incorrect response on the 800 seconds of arc level if the butterfly was not attempted. For each visit, stereoacuity scores were ordered and assigned a rank score. Change in stereoacuity was calculated as the difference in ranked score between the enrollment and 4-week stereoacuity scores.</description>

        <population>Change was only calculated if data was available at both baseline and 4 week time points. Some baseline data was missing in the younger cohort, leading to the numerical inconsistency.</population>

Stereoacuity scores (seconds of arc) were calculated based on the Randot Butterfly (scores: 2000, Nil) and Randot Preschool stereoacuity (scores: 800, 400, 200, 100, 60 and 40) test methods. Lower scores indicate better stereoacuity. Results of the Randot Butterfly test were analyzed as 2000 (if correct response). Nil (4000) was defined as (1) an incorrect response on the butterfly in absence of a correct response on the 800 seconds of arc level of the Randot Preschool stereoacuity test or (2) an incorrect response on the 800 seconds of arc level if the butterfly was not attempted. For each visit, stereoacuity scores were ordered and assigned a rank score. Change in stereoacuity was calculated as the difference in ranked score between the enrollment and 8-week stereoacuity scores.</description>

          <title>Distribution of Change in Stereoacuity Scores From Baseline</title>
          <description>Stereoacuity was tested at near in current refractive correction. Stereoacuity scores (seconds of arc) were calculated based on the Randot Butterfly (scores: 2000, Nil) and Randot Preschool stereoacuity (scores: 800, 400, 200, 100, 60 and 40) test methods. Lower scores indicate better stereoacuity. Results of the Randot Butterfly test were analyzed as 2000 (if correct response). Nil (4000) was defined as (1) an incorrect response on the butterfly in absence of a correct response on the 800 seconds of arc level of the Randot Preschool stereoacuity test or (2) an incorrect response on the 800 seconds of arc level if the butterfly was not attempted. For each visit, stereoacuity scores were ordered and assigned a rank score. Change in stereoacuity was calculated as the difference in ranked score between the enrollment and 8-week stereoacuity scores.</description>
          <population>Change was only calculated if data was available at both baseline and 4 week time points. Some baseline data was missing in the younger cohort, leading to the numerical inconsistency.</population>

        <description>Stereoacuity was tested at near in current refractive correction. Stereoacuity scores (measure as seconds of arc) were calculated based on the Randot Butterfly (scores: 2000, Nil) and Randot Preschool stereoacuity (scores: 800, 400, 200, 100, 60 and 40) test methods.&#xD;
Lower scores indicate better stereoacuity. Results of the Randot Butterfly test were analyzed as 2000 seconds of arc (if correct response). Nil was assigned a score of 4000 seconds of arc and was defined as (1) an incorrect response on the butterfly in absence of a correct response on the 800 seconds of arc level of the Randot Preschool stereoacuity test or (2) an incorrect response on the 800 seconds of arc level if the butterfly was not attempted.</description>

        <description>Data from the automated iPad log files will be used to provide an objective measure of compliance with binocular treatment (participants completion of &gt;75% of prescribed game play). The total amount of game play will be computed for the initial 4 weeks of treatment for the binocular treatment group, as well as throughout 8 weeks. Secondary analyses will evaluate the relationship between the total amount of game play with (1) change in VA and (2) change in stereoacuity after the first 4 weeks of binocular treatment.

The total amount of game play will be computed for the initial 4 weeks of treatment for the binocular treatment group, as well as throughout 8 weeks. Secondary analyses will evaluate the relationship between the total amount of game play with (1) change in VA and (2) change in stereoacuity after the first 4 weeks of binocular treatment.

        <description>The treatment effect after 4 weeks in subgroups based on baseline factors will be assessed in exploratory analyses and used to suggest hypotheses for further investigation in future studies. The following baseline factors are of interest: amblyopic-eye VA, stereoacuity, the presence of a tropia at near, and prior amblyopia treatment (other than spectacle correction). In accordance with NIH guidelines, subgroup analyses of treatment effect according to gender and race/ethnicity will be conducted. Positive values for visual acuity change indicate improvement.</description>
