  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Flexible bronchoscopy is one of the most widely performed procedures for diagnosis of various&#xD;
      bronchopulmonary diseases. Most patients tolerate the procedure well although cough is often&#xD;
      reported as a distressing symptom. It is likely that the acceptance of bronchoscopy would be&#xD;
      significantly improved with control of cough. Use of sedation during bronchoscopy has been&#xD;
      reported to improve procedure tolerance. However, awake(no sedation) bronchoscopy is&#xD;
      routinely performed at many centres including ours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Topical lignocaine is administered during bronchoscopy for local anaesthesia. There is&#xD;
      limited literature on the efficacy of transtracheal/transcricoid injection versus spray as&#xD;
      you go method for lignocaine delivery to the airways during bronchoscopy. This study would&#xD;
      help to determine the procedure comfort for the patient while using the&#xD;
      transtracheal/transcricoid method vs the spray as you go method.&#xD;

      For all patients meeting the inclusion criteria, the demographic profile including age, sex,&#xD;
      weight, smoking history and the type of procedures performed during bronchoscopy shall be&#xD;
      recorded. A written informed consent will be obtained from all participants. The patients who&#xD;
      undergo flexible bronchoscopy would be randomised in a one is to one ratio either to&#xD;
      transcricoid or spray as you go group. Prior to the bronchoscopy blood pressure, pulse rate,&#xD;
      respiratory rate and pulse oximetry saturation will be recorded at the baseline Patients in&#xD;
      both the groups shall be prepared in a similar fashion except for the initial route of&#xD;
      lignocaine delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the procedure, 1.5 ml aliquots of 2% lignocaine solution will be delivered through the&#xD;
      bronchoscope when using spray-as-you go technique. Patients in the transcricoid group shall&#xD;
      initially receive 5 ml of 2% lignocaine solution instilled transtracheally along with two&#xD;
      baseline 1.5 cc bronchial spray aliquots of lignocaine, and additional aliquots of 2%&#xD;
      lignocaine using the spray as you go method. The total lignocaine dose during the procedure&#xD;
      will be recorded. The patients would be monitored for any adverse effects throughout the&#xD;
      procedure. The bronchoscopist doing the procedure will be provided 2 VAS charts to mark the&#xD;
      severity of cough and overall procedure satisfaction. Cough count shall be noted.&#xD;
