      Probiotics are commercially available live bacteria thought to have health benefits when&#xD;
      ingested. A literature review of probiotic studies in the intensive care unit (ICU) found&#xD;
      that in patients who receive probiotics, there is a 25% reduction in lung infection, known as&#xD;
      ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). There is also an 18% reduction in the chance of&#xD;
      developing any infection in the ICU. However, the studies reviewed were small and not well&#xD;
      done. Therefore, whether probiotics are really helpful or not is unclear. Before a large&#xD;
      carefully performed study is done to evaluate the effects of probiotics in critically ill&#xD;
      patients, a pilot trial was needed. The Investigators completed a multicenter pilot RCT for&#xD;
      which the primary outcomes relate to feasibility. Feasibility goals were met. 1) Recruitment&#xD;
      for the Pilot was achieved in 1 year; 2) Adherence to the protocol was 96%; 3) There were no&#xD;
      cases of contamination; 4) The VAP rate was 15%. This study is very important in the ongoing&#xD;
      search for more effective strategies to prevent serious infection during critical illness.&#xD;
      Probiotics may be an easy-to-use, readily available, inexpensive approach to help future&#xD;
      critically ill patients around the world.&#xD;

      Background:Probiotics are live microorganisms thought to have health benefits when ingested.&#xD;
      Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have documented favourable impact on a range of clinical&#xD;
      problems, including prevention of upper respiratory tract infections, antibiotic-associated&#xD;
      diarrhea, Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea, and irritable bowel syndrome. Our recent&#xD;
      meta-analysis of probiotic RCTs in the intensive care unit (ICU) also suggests 25% lower&#xD;
      rates of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and 18% lower infection rates overall when&#xD;
      administered to critically ill mechanically ventilated patients. However, these estimates&#xD;
      arise from small, modest quality single-center RCTs yielding imprecise estimates of effect&#xD;
      and uncertain generalizability, and require confirmation in a large methodologically&#xD;
      rigourous RCT. Before launching a complex costly RCT testing whether probiotics confer&#xD;
      benefit, harm, or have no impact on infectious and non-infectious outcomes, a pilot trial was&#xD;
      needed. The investigators completed a multicenter pilot RCT for which the primary outcomes&#xD;
      relate to feasibility: 1) recruitment success in 1 year; 2) &gt;90% adherence to the probiotic&#xD;
      protocol; 3) &lt;5% contamination; 4) an estimated VAP rate. Patients have been randomized in 14&#xD;
      centers in Canada and the US, with an informed consent rate of 84%. Feasibility goals were&#xD;
      met. 1) Recruitment for the Pilot was achieved in 1 year; 2) Adherence to the protocol was&#xD;
      96%; 3) There were no cases of contamination; 4) The VAP rate was 15%. This will be an&#xD;
      internal Pilot which will be incorporated into the main trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting: 13 ICUs in Canada, 2 ICUs in United States&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Patients age 18 years or older, admitted to the ICU, with an anticipated duration of&#xD;
      ventilation of ≥72 hours are included. Patients are excluded if they have increased risk of&#xD;
      iatrogenic probiotic infection or endovascular infection, primary diagnosis of severe acute&#xD;
      pancreatitis, percutaneous gastric or jejunal feeding tubes already in situe, strict&#xD;
      contraindication or inability to receive enteral medications, have hopeless prognosis,&#xD;
      withholding or withdrawal of advanced life support is planned, or if previous enrolment in&#xD;
      this or a related trial. Following informed consent, patients are randomized in variable&#xD;
      unspecified block sizes in a fixed allocation ratio of 1:1, stratified by ICU and&#xD;
      medical/surgical/trauma status. Twice daily, patients receive either 1x1010 colony forming&#xD;
      units (CFU) of L. rhamnosus GG (Culturelle, Locin Industries Ltd) in 1 capsule or an&#xD;
      identical placebo capsule. Both are suspended in water administered via nasogastric tube or&#xD;
      by capsule. Research Nurses notify local Study Pharmacists after obtaining informed consent.&#xD;
      Study Pharmacists obtain the allocation from the PROSPECT website. Only the Database Manager&#xD;
      and Study Pharmacists will have access to the randomization schedule; everyone else remains&#xD;
      blinded. Patients receive the intervention until:1) ICU discharge; 2) death; or 3) isolation&#xD;
      of Lactobacillus spp. in a sterile site, or if cultured as the sole or predominant organism&#xD;
      from a non-sterile site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RCT Trial Outcomes: The primary outcome is VAP; secondary outcomes include ICU-acquired&#xD;
      infections, diarrhea (total, antibiotic-associated and CDAD), antibiotic use, length of stay&#xD;
      and mortality in the ICU and hospital, and acquired L. rhamnosus GG infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevance: Despite clinical uptake of some existing VAP prevention strategies, the morbidity,&#xD;
      mortality and cost of VAP underscore the need for further cost-effective interventions to&#xD;
      reduce its impact. Whether probiotics impact on VAP, other infections such as CDAD,&#xD;
      antibiotic-associated diarrhea or antibiotic use is unclear. When rigorously evaluated,&#xD;
      probiotics may have salutary effects decreasing nosocomial infections as prior RCTs suggest;&#xD;
      alternatively, probiotics may have no demonstrable effect, or actually cause infections in&#xD;
      critically ill patients with impaired immune function.&#xD;
