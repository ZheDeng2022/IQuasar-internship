  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative illness (after&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease) affecting 1-2% of people over age 65.3 Although PD is traditionally&#xD;
      characterized by its motor symptoms (e.g. tremor, stiffness, slowness), research demonstrates&#xD;
      that cognitive dysfunction has a greater impact on patient suffering and caregiver burden&#xD;
      despite being under-recognized. Cognitive dysfunction is a significant risk factor for&#xD;
      psychosis, dementia, nursing home placement and affects 20- 40% of PD patients even at the&#xD;
      time of initial diagnosis.4,5 In patients with PD surviving 20 years or longer, cognitive&#xD;
      dysfunction is the leading cause of nursing home placement and three fourths of PD patients&#xD;
      ultimately develop dementia.6&#xD;
&#xD;
      We know that neurons in the brain communicate with each other by firing at certain&#xD;
      frequencies. A growing literature shows that high frequency (30-50 Hz) brain activity called&#xD;
      gamma activity is particularly important for communication between distant brain areas and is&#xD;
      critical to normal cognition.7 Prior studies also show that gamma activity is reduced in PD.8&#xD;
      However, we do not know why gamma activity is reduced in PD or the relationship between&#xD;
      changes in gamma activity and cognitive dysfunction. We hypothesize that reductions in gamma&#xD;
      activity are a key mechanism underlying cognitive dysfunction in PD and that interventions to&#xD;
      increase gamma activity will improve cognition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test this hypothesis we propose to use a novel combination of research methods including&#xD;
      magnetoencephalography (MEG) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). MEG&#xD;
      measures magnetic activity over the scalp to determine brain activity. We will use MEG to&#xD;
      determine whether reductions in gamma activity are related to cognitive dysfunction in PD.&#xD;
      TMS uses a magnetic coil placed over the scalp to stimulate brain activity. While there is&#xD;
      evidence that repetitive TMS (transcranial magnetic stimulation) increases gamma activity and&#xD;
      may improve cognition, it has not been studied for this purpose in PD. We will apply&#xD;
      repetitive TMS to PD patients to determine whether gamma activity and/or cognitive function&#xD;
      may be improved non-invasively.&#xD;

    <description>The primary cognitive outcome will be the error rates on the N-back task measured before and after real or sham TMS as a measure of working memory.&#xD;
A negative number indicates that error rate was higher (working memory skills were worse) in the sham than the real condition.&#xD;
A positive number indicates lower error rates (better working memory skills) in the sham vs real stimulation.</description>

    <description>TMS: Repetitive TMS will be administered using a 70-mm diameter air-cooled figure-of-8 coil and SuperRapid2 Stimulator (Magstim, Jali Medical US distributors, Woburn, MA). Repetitive pulses will be delivered to the right and left pre-frontal cortex (Brodman area 46) using a frameless stereotactic navigation system and the subject's MRI in Brainsight software. Stimuli will be delivered at 20 Hz at 90% of the subjects resting motor threshold (rMT) for 25 trains of 30 pulses per train, inter-train interval of 30 seconds for a total of 750 pulses per hemisphere. The same TMS parameters as active stimulation but with the coil held at 90Â° to the scalp to induce similar somatic sensations and noise as in the active group with minimal direct brain effects.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  We will recruit 60 PD patients through the University Colorado Hospital (UCH) Movement&#xD;
             Disorders Clinic diagnosed with probable PD using United Kingdom (UK) Brain Bank&#xD;

      <pre_assignment_details>PI withdrawal of subjects during MEG screening:&#xD;
Several participants have ferromagnetic compounds on their body, that they cannot remove (dental work, pins or screws in bones...) but cause artifacts in the data, which prevents proper data analysis.

        <title>Differences in Error Rates on the NBack Task Between Real and Sham Stimulation Trials</title>
        <description>The primary cognitive outcome will be the error rates on the N-back task measured before and after real or sham TMS as a measure of working memory.&#xD;
A negative number indicates that error rate was higher (working memory skills were worse) in the sham than the real condition.&#xD;
A positive number indicates lower error rates (better working memory skills) in the sham vs real stimulation.</description>

            <title>Parkinson's Disease Subjects</title>
            <description>Participants performed a working memory task during MEG recording. Then PD subjects were randomized to receive a course of either real (rTMS) or sham TMS on a separate day (max 1 week after first MEG). 20 min after TMS subjects again performed the same working memory task while having MEG data recorded REAL: Repetitive TMS was delivered at 20 Hz at 90% of the subjects resting motor threshold (RMT) for 25 trains of 30 pulses per train, inter-train interval of 30 seconds for a total of 750 pulses per hemisphere.&#xD;
SHAM: stimulation was delivered with the same TMS parameters as active simulation but the coil held at 90 degree to the scalp to induce similar somatic sensations and noise as in the active group with minimal brain effects.</description>
