  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is common, may progress to cirrhosis and is predicted to&#xD;
      become a leading indication for liver transplantation in the near future. Though often&#xD;
      associated with obesity and the metabolic syndrome, our current understanding of disease&#xD;
      development is limited and there are few therapeutic options. Imbalance of gut bacteria is&#xD;
      suspected to play a key role driving the progression of fatty liver disease and there is hope&#xD;
      manipulation of these bacteria may be beneficial. This study will determine if fecal&#xD;
      microbiota transplantation, using stool from lean donors, is an effective and safe treatment&#xD;
      for NASH.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH), a severe form of fatty liver disease, is highly&#xD;
      prevalent and can lead to cirrhosis, liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma. It is&#xD;
      strongly associated with obesity and the metabolic syndrome. The impact of the gut microbiota&#xD;
      on obesity and the metabolic syndrome is potentially large and increasing evidence suggests&#xD;
      that dysbiosis might contribute to the development of NASH. There is a fundamental gap in&#xD;
      understanding how alterations in the intestinal microbiota lead to a wide range of metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome associated conditions including fatty liver disease in humans. The long-term goal of&#xD;
      this project is to better understand the mechanisms linking intestinal dysbiosis and&#xD;
      extra-intestinal clinical phenotypes, in particular obesity and NAFLD. Compositional shifts&#xD;
      in gut bacteria from antibiotic use can perpetuate diseases such as Clostridum difficile&#xD;
      infection, and manipulation of the microbiota through stool transplant from healthy donors&#xD;
      can be used to cure disease. The objective of this application is to determine whether&#xD;
      restoration of beneficial gut microbiota via fecal microbiota transplantation using stool&#xD;
      from lean donors (FMT-L) improves NASH. The central hypothesis for this project is that&#xD;
      transfer of gut microbiota from lean donors will result in reduced hepatic steatosis, and&#xD;
      improved histological and biochemical features of NASH, all of which will correlate with&#xD;
      observed changes in the small bowel and distal gut microbiome. This hypothesis will be tested&#xD;
      by pursuing 3 specific aims: 1) determine the effect of FMT-L in patients with NASH on&#xD;
      hepatic steatosis and markers of NASH; 2) perform microbiome analyses on pre- and post-FMT-L&#xD;
      small bowel &amp; stool samples; and 3) investigate mechanistic correlates linking dysbiosis with&#xD;
      histologic changes in NASH after FMT-L. The study will be a pilot open labeled trial&#xD;
      examining the effect of FMT-L in patients with biopsy proven NASH. The primary outcome&#xD;
      measure will be a change in MRI-determined hepatic fat fraction,12 weeks after&#xD;
      transplantation. Differences in the microbiota after FMT-L in the small bowel and distal gut,&#xD;
      including the durability of microbiota changes, will be examined using advanced metagenomic&#xD;
      techniques. Clinical and laboratory features of the metabolic syndrome and obesity as well as&#xD;
      hepatic and systemic inflammatory markers will be examined for mechanistic correlates linking&#xD;
      dysbiosis with histologic changes in the liver. In addition to understanding how the gut&#xD;
      microbiota affects fatty liver disease progression, study findings will provide a framework&#xD;
      for future microbiome research on metabolic syndrome related diseases such as diabetes,&#xD;
      obesity, and other inflammatory disorders. An increased understanding of how the human gut&#xD;
      microbiota is altered in metabolic disease may open a new avenue of therapeutics based on&#xD;
      manipulation of gut bacteria.&#xD;
