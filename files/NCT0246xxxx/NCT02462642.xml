  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Indian Ayurvedic herb Brahmi (Bacopa monniera) has been used to improve cognitive&#xD;
      functions in Indian sub-continent for many years and previous intervention studies have shown&#xD;
      positive effects of Brahmi on cognitive performance in adults. However, the studies are&#xD;
      conducted on various fractions and extracts and there is high likelihood of variability of&#xD;
      composition amongst the fractions/extracts tested in these studies. Furthermore, although the&#xD;
      findings of the previous studies overlap to some extent, they are not consistent and there is&#xD;
      a need to replicate these findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further, even though Brahmi has been studied for its chemical composition and its therapeutic&#xD;
      benefits as a whole, there are still severe gaps with respect to the complete composition of&#xD;
      the Brahmi plant or its extracts. No published data exist on the Pharmacokinetics (PK)&#xD;
      properties of Brahmi components. Hitherto, the evidence and the mechanistic details are still&#xD;
      speculative and the biological activity is still phenomenological. Because of this severe&#xD;
      knowledge gap, this study will try to repeat the findings on cognitive performance and at the&#xD;
      same time also explore the plasma levels of its components in order to initiate the&#xD;
      understanding of ADME aspects and its linkages to the biological effect.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is proposed to be a randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled study with&#xD;
      parallel groups. The duration of the study will be 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For cognition and Anxiety part, each selected subject will be paying 4 visits to clinical&#xD;
      site for the whole study. Screening/selection will be done on visit 1, baseline on visit 2&#xD;
      and post-intervention assessment on visit 3. Subjects will be asked to appear for an&#xD;
      interview before the investigators once more within one month of completion of intervention&#xD;
      to take care of issues, if any. This will be 4th and last visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will be assessed at baseline (Week 1, Day 1); while post intervention assessment&#xD;
      will be carried out immediately on the completion of the 12 weeks. Considering the 84 days&#xD;
      duration of the study, + 3 days for the intervention period will be acceptable. The exact&#xD;
      intervention duration will be documented in days for each subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On each of the two measurement days (baseline and post intervention), the same test battery&#xD;
      will be administered by the same examiner. The outcome measures of this battery include&#xD;
      Verbal Learning and Memory, Information Processing, Attention and Interference and Anxiety.&#xD;
      The test battery will be administered in English.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On each of the measurement day the subject will spend a maximum of 1Â½ hours at the clinical&#xD;
      site. Subjects will be examined in the morning at approximately the same time during both&#xD;
      measurement days to keep conditions constant across the subjects and for baseline and post&#xD;
      intervention assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject participating in Pharmacokinetics (PK) part, will pay 6 visits. Visit 1 will be&#xD;
      screening, Visit 2,3 and 4 for initial blood withdrawal and visit 5 will post intervention&#xD;
      blood sampling. Subjects will be asked to appear for an interview before the investigators&#xD;
      once more within one month of completion of intervention to take care of issues, if any,&#xD;
      which will be visit 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood sampling will be done at 0,1,2,4,8,24,48 hours and one sample at the endo of 12 weeks&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
