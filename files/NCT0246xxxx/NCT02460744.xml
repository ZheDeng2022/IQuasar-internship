  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators at PGIMER have been practicing hypofractionation radiotherapy with a dose&#xD;
      of 35Gy/15#/3wks to the chest wall in post mastectomy and 40Gy/16#/3wks in breast&#xD;
      conservation in breast cancer patients for the last 4 decades. It is also a routine practice&#xD;
      in UK and few centers in Canada. Hypofractionation reduces treatment time to half while&#xD;
      maintaining cosmesis and gives control rates equal to conventional fractionation. As breast&#xD;
      cancer is a leading cancer in females and radiation therapy is an important part of its local&#xD;
      management, hypofractionation help the radiation centers worldwide to meet the growing need&#xD;
      for radiation in breast cancer, particularly in developing countries where resources are&#xD;
      limited. It also reduces the financial burden on the patient and family.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the investigators want to reduce the treatment duration from 3 weeks to 2&#xD;
      weeks. The study will include 20 patients with breast cancer post mastectomy or after breast&#xD;
      conservative surgery to be treated with a radiotherapy dose of 34Gy in 10 fractions over 2&#xD;
      weeks. Patients will be assessed for acute radiation toxicity weekly during treatment and&#xD;
      after one month of completion of treatment.&#xD;

      Patients to be included in this study will be pre-operatively staged according to American&#xD;
      Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 7th edition, International Union against cancer ( which uses&#xD;
      TNM staging ) as stage I , stage II of breast carcinoma. Twenty patients of histologically&#xD;
      proven post lumpectomy/mastectomy cases of carcinoma breast suitable for radiotherapy will be&#xD;
      enrolled in this study. Patients would be evaluated at the Department of Radiotherapy PGIMER,&#xD;
      Chandigarh by doing a thorough clinical examination followed by routine investigations which&#xD;
      will include hemogram, liver function tests, kidney function tests, chest X-ray. Patients&#xD;
      will be treated by standard rectangular tangential fields.The study will include 20 patients&#xD;
      with breast cancer post mastectomy or after breast conservative surgery to be treated with a&#xD;
      radiotherapy dose of 34Gy in 10 fractions over 2 weeks followed by a boost of 10Gy/5#/1wk in&#xD;
      cases with intact breast. Acute toxicity will be assessed using a RTOG grading system. This&#xD;
      will be carried out weekly during radiotherapy and for 4 weeks after treatment. If symptoms&#xD;
      persist the patients will be assessed weekly until their reaction settles to RTOG grade 1 or&#xD;
      less (Annexure I).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses The principle end point of the study is an analysis of acute toxicities,&#xD;
      cosmetic score analysis. Skin, subcutaneous toxicity and cosmetic assessment will be done&#xD;
      before treatment and then in regular follow up of the study. Chi-square test will be used to&#xD;
      compare radiation toxicity parameters. Descriptive statistics including mean and standard&#xD;
      deviation will be obtained for all variables. p values of &lt;0.05 will be taken as significant.&#xD;
      All tests would be performed using SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) v.12.0.&#xD;
