      The major goal of this study is to establish a National PAP Registry to help make reliable&#xD;
      new research tests available to doctors to improve the diagnosis of PAP, increase awareness&#xD;
      and knowledge of PAP, and give patients a 'seat at the table' in planning and conducting PAP&#xD;
      research including the clinical testing of several new potential therapies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PAP is a rare syndrome of surfactant accumulation and resulting hypoxemic respiratory failure&#xD;
      that occurs in a number of diseases classified pathogenically into three groups: primary PAP&#xD;
      (caused by disruption of GM-CSF signaling - autoimmune PAP, hereditary PAP), secondary PAP&#xD;
      (caused by reduction in alveolar macrophage numbers and/or functions), and surfactant&#xD;
      dysfunction-related PAP (caused by mutations in genes required for normal surfactant&#xD;
      production). In current clinical practice, PAP is diagnosed based on a lung biopsy; an&#xD;
      approach that is not able to identify the PAP-causing disease in anyone. Current therapy&#xD;
      involves the physical removal of surfactant by a procedure in which the lungs are repeatedly&#xD;
      filled with saline and emptied - whole lung lavage, which is invasive, inefficient, and not&#xD;
      widely available, especially for children. Importantly, research advances have elucidated the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of diseases causing PAP in most patients and have identified new diagnostic and&#xD;
      therapeutic approaches. Simple blood-based research tests can now identify the PAP-causing&#xD;
      disease in about 95% of patients. Further, several promising potential disease-specific&#xD;
      therapies are currently in development. The long-term goals of the Rare Lung Diseases&#xD;
      Consortium include improving the diagnosis and therapy of people with PAP. A major goal of&#xD;
      this protocol is to establish a National PAP Registry. Our central hypothesis is that a&#xD;
      nationwide campaign to enroll and communicate with a large cohort of PAP patients will have&#xD;
      important benefits including 1) accelerating the translation of research diagnostics into&#xD;
      clinical practice, 2) increasing knowledge among patient and healthcare communities about&#xD;
      PAP, and 3) engagement of PAP patients and doctors in planning and conducting PAP research.&#xD;
      The specific objectives of this study are to: 1) determine the ability of the DBSC GMAb Test&#xD;
      to correctly identify autoimmune PAP among people with PAP of any type, 2) estimate the&#xD;
      prevalence of autoimmune PAP, 3) increase communication and knowledge about PAP-causing&#xD;
      diseases, PAP research advances, and future research studies among PAP patients, healthcare&#xD;
      providers, the medical community, the PAP Foundation, the Translational Pulmonary Science&#xD;
      Center (TPSC) and the general public, 4) evaluate the ability of DBSC-based test to correctly&#xD;
      identify genetic factors that increase the risk of developing PAP; and 5) to evaluate the&#xD;
      ability of the DBSC GMAb Test to correctly identify autoimmune PAP among people with PAP of&#xD;
      any type, or another lung diseases, and healthy controls. The target population is any person&#xD;
      diagnosed with PAP. The study design will involve recruitment, screening, and enrollment of&#xD;
      Participants via short telephone-based study visits, completion of questionnaires, and&#xD;
      collection of capillary blood from the fingertip by Participants in their home using a DBSC,&#xD;
      which are then sent by US mail to the TPSC for evaluation. The experimental approach will&#xD;
      compare GMAb levels from DBSCs from Participants diagnosed with PAP and determine the&#xD;
      fraction of autoimmune PAP patients among individuals with PAP. DBSC-based genetic testing&#xD;
      will be compared to current blood-based methods for identification of known genetic risk&#xD;
      factors for developing PAP. Lastly, DBSC GMAb values will be compared to GMAb values from&#xD;
      healthy and lung disease controls to determine the ability of the DBSC GMAb test to identify&#xD;
      patients with autoimmune PAP. Anticipated results will establish a National PAP registry,&#xD;
      validate tests for diagnosis of diseases causing PAP in more than 90% of patients, increase&#xD;
      awareness and understanding of PAP among patients and healthcare providers, and provide for a&#xD;
      patient voice in PAP research. These results will impact the field by: 1) transforming how&#xD;
      PAP is diagnosed, 2) increasing access to diagnostic testing - of special importance to those&#xD;
      in remote locations, and 3) engaging PAP patient and healthcare communities in planning and&#xD;
      implementing PAP research including a prospective natural history study and clinical trials&#xD;
      evaluating several potential, disease-specific therapies.&#xD;
