      RATIONALE: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype shown to have a high&#xD;
      risk of locoregional recurrence (LRR) and distant metastasis (DM). The equivalent impact of&#xD;
      breast-conserving therapy (BCT) and mastectomy on disease-free survival in patients with&#xD;
      early breast cancer has been established by a number of large randomized controlled trials&#xD;
      and meta-analysis. However, ongoing dispute exists on whether TNBC is a good candidate for&#xD;
      BCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This prospective, randomized, open, single-center Phase III clinical study is&#xD;
      conducted to compare efficacy and safety of breast-conserving therapy and mastectomy in&#xD;
      treating Chinese patients with early TNBC.&#xD;

      STUDY POPULATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operable patients with T1-2N0-1M0 triple-negative breast cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary To assess the impact of breast-conserving therapy on disease-free survival compared&#xD;
      with mastectomy in patients with T1-2N0-1M0 triple-negative breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary To assess the impact of breast-conserving therapy on locoregional recurrence-free&#xD;
      survival (LRRFS) and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) compared with mastectomy in&#xD;
      patients with T1-2N0-1M0 triple-negative breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, randomized, open, single-center Phase III clinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo either lumpectomy or mastectomy with surgical axillary staging with all&#xD;
      lesions resected to negative margins based on the results of randomization generated by&#xD;
      computer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with stage I and II receive adjuvant chemotherapy using TC and TAC regimen&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since all tumors are smaller than 5cm and metastatic lymph nodes are less than 4, patients&#xD;
      undergoing mastectomy do not receive radiation therapy. On the hand, within 4-8 weeks after&#xD;
      completion of chemotherapy, patients undergoing breast-conserving surgery receive radiation&#xD;
      therapy as follows: (1) N0: Radiation therapy to whole breast (+boost to tumor bed) or&#xD;
      consideration of partial breast irradiation in selected patients; (2) N1: Radiation therapy&#xD;
      to whole breast (+boost to tumor bed), infraclavicular region, and supraclavicular area with&#xD;
      or without radiation therapy to internal mammary nodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and&#xD;
      then 6 months for years 3-5.&#xD;

    <description>Patients undergo lumpectomy with surgical axillary staging with all lesions resected to negative margins.&#xD;
