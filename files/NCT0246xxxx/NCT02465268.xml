  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine if an investigational dendritic cell&#xD;
      vaccine, called pp65 DC, is effective for the treatment of a specific type of brain tumor&#xD;
      called glioblastoma (GBM) when given with stronger doses of routine chemotherapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dendritic cells (DC) are involved in activating, or turning-on, your body's immune system.&#xD;
      Your immune system helps guard your body from germs, viruses, and other threats. Although&#xD;
      dendritic cells are very strong, the number of them in the body is not high enough to cause a&#xD;
      powerful immune response; therefore, more DC are made in a laboratory with cells collected&#xD;
      from an individual's blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we will make a vaccine that we hope will educate immune cells to target the&#xD;
      pp65 antigen, a type of immune marker in GBM, thus resulting in what we call the pp65 DC&#xD;
      vaccine. Use of a vaccine that activates your immune system is a type of immunotherapy. It is&#xD;
      hoped that by giving the pp65 DC vaccine as a shot under the skin, the immune system will be&#xD;
      activated to attack tumor cells in the brain while leaving normal cells alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if the pp65 DC vaccine is effective for the treatment of GBM, subjects will be&#xD;
      assigned to different treatment groups. Two groups of subjects will receive the pp65 DC&#xD;
      vaccine and one group will receive a placebo.&#xD;
