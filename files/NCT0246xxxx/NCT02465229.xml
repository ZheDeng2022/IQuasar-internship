  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Biliary strictures present a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge to clinicians due to&#xD;
      unsatisfied accuracy of sampling modality. The major problem is very difficult to discern&#xD;
      malignant from non-malignant strictures, such as patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis&#xD;
      (PSC). With the poor prognosis and high mortality rate of advanced stage of&#xD;
      hepatopancreaticobiliary malignancies, early and accurate diagnosis impacts patients' outcome&#xD;
      and possible surgical candidacy. Therefore, a pre-operative determination of malignancy to&#xD;
      help plan appropriate treatment is highly desirable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before 2000s, several diagnostic modalities, including laboratory tests, ultrasonography&#xD;
      (US), computed tomography (CT) scan, cholangiography by percutaneous transhepatic&#xD;
      cholangiography endoscopic (PTC) and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP),&#xD;
      and brushing cytology disclosed 13% to 24% false positive rate for suspicious malignant hilar&#xD;
      strictures. Compared to recent studies, ERCP brushings still suffer from low sensitivity&#xD;
      (41.6% ± 3.2% (99% CI)) and negative predictive value (58.0% ± 3.2% (99% CI)). In order to&#xD;
      increase diagnostic accuracy, at least two sampling methods, including brushing cytology,&#xD;
      biopsy, and fine-needle aspiration is therefore recommended. One article showed multimodal&#xD;
      tissue-sampling (Brushing + Biopsy + Fine-needle aspiration) increased the sensitivity for&#xD;
      diagnosis of malignant biliary stricture to 62%. However, no any literature demonstrate the&#xD;
      best sequence of combined sampling modalities to yield the highest diagnostic accuracy.&#xD;
      Besides, the role of stricture dilation before or after different tissue sampling modality is&#xD;
      still uncertain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators want to compare stricture dilation before or after&#xD;
      multimodal tissue-sampling, including brush cytology, intraductal suction and forceps biopsy&#xD;
      for the diagnosis of malignant biliary stricture and also assess which kind of the sequence&#xD;
      of combined tissue-sampling modalities could offer the highest diagnostic accuracy.&#xD;
