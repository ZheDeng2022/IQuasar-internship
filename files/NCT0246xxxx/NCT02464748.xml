  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Motor neurone disease (MND) is a rare but debilitating neurological condition that causes&#xD;
      paralysis of the body's muscles leading to severe disability and eventually death. Patients&#xD;
      often struggle to travel the long distances to specialist clinics to receive the care they&#xD;
      require whilst this expert care is often unavailable in the community. Telehealth has the&#xD;
      potential to enable a specialist team to monitor the health and wellbeing of patients and&#xD;
      their carers whilst they are at home. This could improve the patient's health, improve the&#xD;
      quality of life of both patients and their carers, and lead to more effective use of health&#xD;
      resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomised controlled pilot study that will involve 40 patients who are cared for&#xD;
      by the Sheffield Motor Neurone Disease care centre and their main informal carer (a total of&#xD;
      80 participants). Half of the participants will use the telehealth system for a minimum of&#xD;
      six months and maximum of eighteen months and information will be collected from patients,&#xD;
      carers and their care team. This will include collecting clinical outcome measures, health&#xD;
      resource use and the opinions and experience of using the system. All participants will&#xD;
      continue to receive their usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pilot study. It aims to determine the feasibility and acceptability of the&#xD;
      telehealth system to patients, carers and their health care providers. It also aims to&#xD;
      determine how a larger trial could successfully evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness&#xD;
      of the system.&#xD;

        Patient Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients aged 18 years or over who have attended the MND clinic at the Royal&#xD;
             Hallamshire Hospital, Sheffield.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis diagnosed by a consultant neurologist with&#xD;
             symptom onset within the last three years.&#xD;
&#xD;
             o Or&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, primary muscular atrophy or progressive&#xD;
             lateral sclerosis diagnosed by a consultant neurologist with a deterioration in their&#xD;
             condition as evidenced by a deterioration in the ALS functional rating score&#xD;
             (ALSFRS-R) by at least two points during the previous 18 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Live within 120 minute drive from Sheffield&#xD;
