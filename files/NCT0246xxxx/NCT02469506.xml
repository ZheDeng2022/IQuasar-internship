  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Situations such as fractures of the lower extremity can necessitate a prolonged&#xD;
      period of immobilization in otherwise healthy individuals. Long-term immobilization of the&#xD;
      lower extremity has shown to cause significant reductions in skeletal muscle mass, already&#xD;
      occurring during the early stages of disuse. Accordingly, feasible strategies for attenuating&#xD;
      this loss of muscle during disuse need to be pursued. Local neuromuscular electrical&#xD;
      stimulation (NMES) offers such a potential strategy but, as yet, remains untested during&#xD;
      prolonged muscle disuse in a clinical setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To investigate whether twice daily local (gastrocnemius/soleus) NMES attenuates&#xD;
      muscle loss during 2 weeks of unilateral ankle immobilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Randomized, parallel (two groups) study design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: 30 adults (18-65 y) with any form of closed ankle fractures needing&#xD;
      surgical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Twice daily neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) or no intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: Primary: Calf muscle (gastrocnemius) cross sectional area&#xD;
      (CSA) as determined by CT scan. Secondary: type I and II muscle fiber CSA and SC content,&#xD;
      intramuscular triglyceride content and mRNA and protein expression of anabolic signaling&#xD;
      proteins.&#xD;
