    <textblock>
      Heart failure (HF) remains to have a poor outcome. Even though recent advances in HF led to a&#xD;
      reduction of morbidity and mortality, improvement in outcome is much less than expected based&#xD;
      on large randomized trials. Various reasons may be responsible, such as complexity of disease&#xD;
      and comorbidities, inadequate diagnosis and inappropriate treatment. So far, little attention&#xD;
      has been paid on patients seen in primary care. Also, HF care mainly focuses on the&#xD;
      individual patient-doctor relationship. However, the increasing complexity prevents&#xD;
      individual physicians from covering all aspects of care. Consequently, multiple stakeholders&#xD;
      are involved, including both general practitioners and specialists. Still, the relative role,&#xD;
      the interaction between them and the processes included are hardly defined. These aspects may&#xD;
      not only be relevant for patient care, but also for the setup of health care systems. Whereas&#xD;
      multidisciplinary team should resemble a seamless system across primary and hospital care,&#xD;
      there is a scarcity of research considering how these disease management programs perform, in&#xD;
      what form they should be offered, and what care and support patients and caregivers would&#xD;
      benefit most.The INTERACT-in HF (Improving kNowldege Transfer to Efficaciously RAise level of&#xD;
      Contemporary Treatment in Heart Failure) study is set up to determine and assess relevant&#xD;
      factors of the quality of HF care. The study evaluates processes of HF care, role of relevant&#xD;
      care givers and interactions between them. It collects data from individual patients to&#xD;
      assess characteristics and management of contemporary HF patients. This is performed in&#xD;
      different countries (the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany) to analyze decision making with&#xD;
      respect to diagnostics and treatment.Cross-sectional mixed-methods are used. Patients and&#xD;
      their caregivers are interviewed. The patient is the central starting point. Then, the&#xD;
      treating GP, cardiologist and HF nurse are interviewed. In parallel, retrospective data based&#xD;
      on records from these patients are reviewed to verify data from interviews and to determine&#xD;
      characteristics of them. Retrospective data of additional patients are collected to complete&#xD;
      the picture of the current situation. These data will be used to define bottlenecks that&#xD;
      prevent best clinical practice to be used in daily care at all levels, comparing practice in&#xD;
      different countries.Thus, the proposal aims to better understand HF care, which will lead to&#xD;
      a better care and finally to improved outcome.&#xD;

        Patients with the following inclusion criteria are suitable for participation in the study:&#xD;
        age ≥18 years, signs, diagnosis or suspicion of heart failure and are contractually capable&#xD;
        and mentally able to understand and follow the instructions of the study personnel (i.e.&#xD;
        speaking and understanding the local language, being able to have a conversation for about&#xD;
        an hour, being able to hear and speak). All subjects have to be able to give informed&#xD;
        consent. Patients who had undergone heart transplantation are excluded. Otherwise, no&#xD;
        exclusion criteria apply. The health care providers of these patients (cardiologists, GP's&#xD;
        and HF-nurses) are also contacted to participate in this study.&#xD;
