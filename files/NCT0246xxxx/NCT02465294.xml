  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the addition of two different probiotic&#xD;
      interventions to a comprehensive behavioral lifestyle intervention on body weight loss and&#xD;
      overall health in overweight adults.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study. After obtaining informed&#xD;
      consent, healthy overweight adults aged 18 to 75 years (n=76/intervention group with n=228&#xD;
      total/study) will be randomized to one of three groups: Lactobacillus, a blend of&#xD;
      Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus, or placebo. Participants will consume 1 capsule per day of&#xD;
      probiotic or placebo for 12 weeks. Participants will attend weekly behavioral lifestyle&#xD;
      intervention meetings, which will address dietary and physical activity contributions to&#xD;
      weight loss, in groups of approximately 20 subjects during the 12 intervention weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete daily questionnaires throughout the week before and during the&#xD;
      intervention period which address subject compliance and bowel habits. A dual X-ray&#xD;
      absorptivity scan will be done to measure body composition during the week before the&#xD;
      intervention and during the 12th week of the intervention period (± 1 week). Blood samples&#xD;
      will be collected via a finger prick at the baseline and final time points. Blood samples&#xD;
      will be used to measure cardiovascular and metabolic markers of health. Stool samples will be&#xD;
      collected from 25 subjects per intervention group during the week before the intervention&#xD;
      period and the 12th week of the intervention period. Dietary intake will be assessed during&#xD;
      the week before the intervention period and during the week of the final appointment (± 1&#xD;
      week). Gastrointestinal symptoms and physical activity questionnaires will be completed upon&#xD;
      providing consent to the study, being randomized to an intervention, and during the last week&#xD;
      of the intervention period. Questionnaires regarding income, weight control strategies, and&#xD;
      quality of life will be completed during randomization and during the last week of the&#xD;
      intervention period. Stool samples will be collected from a subgroup of participants during&#xD;
      the week before the intervention period and during the 12th week of the intervention period.&#xD;
      These samples will be used to detect the presence and/or abundance and/or survival of the&#xD;
      probiotic microorganisms at the end of the digestive tract.&#xD;
