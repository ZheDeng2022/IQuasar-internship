      Formula contains significantly higher total protein concentrations than breast milk.&#xD;
      Therefore formula-fed infants have a significantly higher total protein intake in the first&#xD;
      few months compared to exclusively breast-fed infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to examine the nutritive efficacy and safety of a modified infant formula with a&#xD;
      reduced protein content and improved protein quality in a prospective, double-blind,&#xD;
      controled, randomized study. Primary outcome measures are weight gain and growth of young&#xD;
      infants under 12 weeks of dietary intake of the new infant formula. Metabolic effects of the&#xD;
      qualitative and quantitative changes in the protein content of the new formula will be&#xD;
      recorded. Two groups of healthy bottle-fed infants will be compared. The treatment group will&#xD;
      be fed for 3 months with an infant formula with decreased protein content. At the same time&#xD;
      the protein body of the new formula is modified by enrichment with bovine alpha-lactalbumin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A control group receives a isocaloric conventional infant formula and a protein body&#xD;
      consisting of whey protein and casein in a ratio of 60:40, without specific accumulation of&#xD;
      alpha-lactalbumin over the same time-period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A group of breastmilk fed infants will serve as a reference group. In regular anthropometric&#xD;
      controls growth and thriving of the study participants is documented and compared between the&#xD;
      different groups.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast milk is considered the gold standard for early childhood nutrition, it is optimized in&#xD;
      terms of ingredients to the needs of the infant in the first months of life. Formula differ&#xD;
      in many ways in their composition to breast milk, e.g. in the structure and concentration of&#xD;
      the protein contained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To ensure adequate supply of the infant with all essential and semi-essential amino acids&#xD;
      conventional infant formula contains significantly higher total protein concentrations than&#xD;
      breast milk. Therefore formula-fed infants have a significantly higher total protein intake&#xD;
      in the first few months compared to exclusively breast-fed infants, and individual amino&#xD;
      acids are therefore fed in excess.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The increased intake of protein, and thus the increased intake of some insulinogenic amino&#xD;
      acids in infancy (e.g. the branched chain amino acids leucine, isoleucine and valine), is now&#xD;
      considered as a possible co-factor for later disposition to overweight and obesity.&#xD;
      Breastfeeding induces slower growth of the infant and is proven to be associated with a lower&#xD;
      risk of being overweight or obese at the time of school entry (von Kries 1999). The higher&#xD;
      protein intake in bottle-fed babies seems to contribute significantly to the differences that&#xD;
      can be observed in the growth behavior between breast-fed and bottle-fed children in the&#xD;
      first years of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obvious approaches to optimize infant formula are therefore the reduction of protein content,&#xD;
      while ensuring an adequate supply of all relevant amino acids similar to breast milk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrichment with alpha-lactalbumin enables the reduction of total protein content in the&#xD;
      formula through the qualitative upgrading of the protein body and the high content of&#xD;
      essential amino acids, thereby limiting a surplus of protein intake, but at the same time to&#xD;
      supply adequate amounts of essential amino acids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to examine the nutritive efficacy and safety of a modified infant formula with a&#xD;
      reduced protein content and improved protein quality. Primary outcome measures are weight&#xD;
      gain and growth of young infants under the 12 weeks of dietary intake of the new infant&#xD;
      formula, and metabolic effects of the qualitative and quantitative changes in the protein&#xD;
      content of the new formula. Two groups of healthy bottle-fed infants will be compared. The&#xD;
      treatment group will be fed for 3 months with an infant formula with decreased protein&#xD;
      content. At the same time the body of experimental protein infant formula was modified by&#xD;
      enrichment with bovine alpha-lactalbumin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A control group receives a isocaloric conventional infant formula and a protein body&#xD;
      consisting of whey protein and casein in a ratio of 60:40, without specific accumulation of&#xD;
      alpha-lactalbumin over the same time period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A group of breastmilk fed infants will serve as a reference group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In regular anthropometric controls growth and thriving of the study participants is&#xD;
      documented and compared between the different groups. In addition, laboratory tests are&#xD;
      carried out, which will examine the influence of diet on insulin response, protein metabolism&#xD;
      and specific growth factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a follow-up long-term effects of nutrition on body composition will be recorded by&#xD;
      comparing body fat measurements (skinfold thickness-Calipometrie) during the first year of&#xD;
      life.&#xD;
