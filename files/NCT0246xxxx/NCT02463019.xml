    <textblock>
      This open-label study is an roll-over extension of a randomized trial &quot;Efficacy of Tenofovir&#xD;
      Disoproxil Fumarate in Chronic Hepatitis B Patients with High Viral Load but Slight&#xD;
      Aminotransferase Elevation&quot; (NCT01522625).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After finishing the 3-year therapeutic trial, all patients receive open-label TDF for another&#xD;
      3 years. All patients undergo liver biopsy to evaluate the stage of fibrosis after the 3-year&#xD;
      open-label therapy. During the 3-year period, patients were followed up every 12 weeks for&#xD;
      the biochemical, serological, virological parameters, and adverse reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is the progression of liver fibrosis. Safety issues such as change of&#xD;
      renal function and bone mineral density are 2nd outcomes.&#xD;

      Background The indication to start NUCs remains controversial in non-cirrhotic compensated&#xD;
      patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). Specifically, it has not been clarified whether high&#xD;
      serum concentration of HBV DNA warrants treatment despite only mild elevation of serum&#xD;
      alanine aminotransferase (ALT). In order to elucidate this unresolved issue, we've conducted&#xD;
      a double blind placebo controlled randomized trial to investigate the efficacy of Tenofovir&#xD;
      Disoproxil Fumarate (TDF) in CHB patients with high viral load but only mildly elevated serum&#xD;
      ALT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This open-label rollover study is an extension of the aforementioned randomized trial. For&#xD;
      those who are initially randomized to placebo and later receive open-label TDF, there is a&#xD;
      rare opportunity to study the efficacy of TDF by using the same patient as his/her own&#xD;
      control. For those already randomized to TDF in the trial, the investigators will be able to&#xD;
      closely monitor all aspects of therapeutic responses (i.e., biochemical, virological,&#xD;
      serological, and histological) during a 6-year treatment course in an Asian cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regardless of their initial treatment assignment, these enrolled patients offer a unique&#xD;
      opportunity to further explore the effectiveness of TDF in CHB in that they have paired&#xD;
      biopsied liver tissue and comprehensive information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of this study is the evolution of liver fibrosis during the therapeutic&#xD;
      course. The secondary endpoints are virological response including not only serum viral load&#xD;
      but also intracellular HBV markers such as viral covalently closed circular (ccc) DNA,&#xD;
      serological response including HBsAg seroconversion, HBeAg seroconversion, and quantification&#xD;
      of HBsAg, biochemical response such as AST, ALT, and adverse reactions with particular&#xD;
      attention to clinical events regarding bone and renal safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Occurrence of drug resistance is also an important end point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After enrollment, all patients are interviewed with a structured questionnaire to obtain&#xD;
      information regarding demographic data, social-economic status, life style, and medical&#xD;
      history. Physical checkup, hemogram, blood biochemistry, serology of HBV, serum viral load,&#xD;
      HBV genotype, and abdominal sonography are performed at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled patients are followed up by telephone or interview every 4 weeks and physically&#xD;
      examined every 12 weeks. At each follow-up visit, patients are instructed to return the&#xD;
      untaken drugs. A patient is defined as compliant if she or he completes at least 80% of the&#xD;
      drugs. AST, ALT, HBV DNA, and quantitative HBsAg will be measured every 12 weeks. Serum&#xD;
      biochemistry (bilirubin, PT, P, K, Cre), urinalysis, alpha-fetoprotein, HBeAg, and anti-HBe&#xD;
      and abdominal sonography are measured every 24 weeks. Hemogram and anti-HBs will be checked&#xD;
      annually.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Percutaneous liver biopsy will be performed at the beginning of this project and after&#xD;
      completing the 3-year (156 weeks) trial period. Serology of HBV (HBsAg, anti-HBs, HBeAg, and&#xD;
      anti-HBe) is determined by commercially available immunoassays (ABBOTT GmbH&amp; Co., Wiesbaden,&#xD;
      Germany). Serum HBV DNA is measured quantitatively by quantitative polymerase chain reaction&#xD;
      method (Roche COBAS TaqMan Assay). Histopathological specimens obtained by liver biopsy will&#xD;
      be evaluated independently by two central histopathologists who are unaware of patients'&#xD;
      clinical information. The final report of liver histology is based on the agreement of these&#xD;
      two pathologists and if necessary a third pathologist may be invited to settle disagreement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis Both Intent-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) analyses will be performed to&#xD;
      assess therapeutic efficacy. All randomized patients are included in the ITT analysis and all&#xD;
      protocol violators (compliance less than 80%, loss to follow-up, withdrawal from study) will&#xD;
      be excluded from PP analysis. Quantitative data are summarized as mean Â± standard deviation&#xD;
      (SD) and categorical variables as percentages. Fisher's exact test is used to compare&#xD;
      proportions of categorical variables. Unpaired and paired student's t-tests are used to&#xD;
      compare means of continuous variables between groups and within groups respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will apply a multiple logistic regression analysis to investigate factors&#xD;
      associated with therapeutic efficacy. All tests are two-tailed and a p value less than 0.05&#xD;
      is considered as statistically significant.&#xD;
