    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted by Bassett Healthcare Network in coordination with Bassett&#xD;
      Cancer Institute. Patients prescribed oral chemotherapies will be approached to consider&#xD;
      consent to this study. This study will try to establish if nursing interventions can help&#xD;
      improve patients' adherence to taking their oral chemotherapies as prescribed by their&#xD;
      doctor. Oral chemotherapies are emerging as a growing treatment of choice for many cancer&#xD;
      diagnoses. Adherence to the prescribed treatment plan is very important to gain the best&#xD;
      response to these types of treatments. The study will examine if nursing intervention via&#xD;
      weekly phone calls may help improve adherence to oral chemotherapy treatment plans.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to investigate which nursing intervention will help to improve&#xD;
      adherence in adult patients who are receiving oral chemotherapy. This study will identify the&#xD;
      barriers to adherence, interventions that will increase patients' adherence, and the role of&#xD;
      nursing in promoting oral chemotherapy adherence. Oral chemotherapy adherence is important in&#xD;
      the setting of cancer care as many new chemotherapy medications being approved for use are&#xD;
      oral chemotherapies. Nursing responsibility in this study is to help promote interventions&#xD;
      that would improve adherence. The literature shows that the best intervention to promote&#xD;
      adherence to oral chemotherapy is education that patients receive prior to them starting&#xD;
      their treatment. The interventions such as the MEMS system, AVR, and the generic diary were&#xD;
      studied and found to be somewhat effective in improving adherence, but not reliable. The&#xD;
      literature supports the use of individualized and personalized education for patients. The&#xD;
      education should be in terms that they can understand and absorb, and it should be&#xD;
      information that they need related to their treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral chemotherapy has emerged as the growing treatment of choice in the cancer treatment&#xD;
      specialty; accounting for a quarter of the 400 anticancer medications currently under&#xD;
      development (Simchowitz et al., 2010). There are now more than 20 oral antineoplastic agents&#xD;
      approved for use in the United States alone; and dozens more under development (Ruddy, Mayer,&#xD;
      &amp; Partridge, 2009). Chemotherapy treatments are moving in the direction of conveniences for&#xD;
      patients. Oral chemotherapies can be given to patients to take home and be administered in&#xD;
      the convenience of their homes. This process works for some patients, but not all.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the biggest issues that health care providers find with oral chemotherapy is the&#xD;
      non-adherence with the regimens. Without nursing education and follow up interventions,&#xD;
      adherence is even more difficult to obtain. Although some patients want to experience having&#xD;
      the same care and intervention as a patient receiving intravenous chemotherapy, the mindset&#xD;
      of receiving oral chemotherapy is that it is just a pill and not taken seriously by some&#xD;
      patients. In a study conducted at Dana Farber, most patients would prefer oral chemotherapy&#xD;
      to intravenous (IV) chemotherapy for its convenience, ease of use, and painless&#xD;
      administration (Simchowitz et al., 2010). Although most patients realize the importance of&#xD;
      taking their medication and adhering to the regimen, they are still non-adherent and suffer&#xD;
      unneeded side effects due to that non-adherence. Not to mention that they do not get the full&#xD;
      therapeutic effect of the oral chemotherapy regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard process for treatment with oral chemotherapy agents start with the providers&#xD;
      request for the agent via prescription. Once patient has received approval and has the drug&#xD;
      available, the patient will call the cancer center to set up a formal educational appointment&#xD;
      with an oncology certified chemotherapy nurse (OCN). The OCN meets with the patient to review&#xD;
      potential side effects, how to manage those side effects, and how to properly take the oral&#xD;
      chemotherapy. It will be at this education appointment that, the patient will be approached&#xD;
      for interest in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be identified as any patient that has an oral chemotherapy prescribed that&#xD;
      meets the inclusion criteria (please see inclusion/exclusion criteria list later in this&#xD;
      document). If the patient expresses interest informed consent process will begin.Once patient&#xD;
      has given informed consent, the OCN will confirm eligibility. Once consented and eligibility&#xD;
      verified, they will be randomized to either the control group (no intervention, standard of&#xD;
      care [SOC]) or to the study group (the intervention group). The initial sample size is 60.&#xD;
      All eligible patients' prescribed oral chemotherapy will be approached until sample size of&#xD;
      60 participants has been reached. An interim analysis will be completed after 60 patients&#xD;
      have completed the study to assess adequacy of the sample size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If randomized to the study arm, the OCN will follow-up with that patient at week one, two,&#xD;
      three via phone,. At week four, follow-up will occur at the patients routinely scheduled&#xD;
      medical oncology visit. For the control group, data will be collected at initial education&#xD;
      visit and again at the 4 week physician visit. At the initial education visit both the study&#xD;
      group and the control group will receive the standard chemotherapy education, and complete a&#xD;
      QOL questionnaire. For the study group, at the initial education visit, a time for each phone&#xD;
      call that is convenient for the patient will be scheduled. At each phone call, the OCN will&#xD;
      get a pill count and discuss reasons for missed doses if applicable; grade any adverse events&#xD;
      (AE's) experienced and interventions for those side effects; and answer any questions or&#xD;
      concerns that they patient may be having.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group will not receive contact by the OCN at week 1, 2 and 3. At week four, both&#xD;
      the control group and the study group will have a complete physical, pill count, QOL&#xD;
      completion and document any AE experienced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The quality of life (QOL) survey tool will be a questionnaire that is self-reported by the&#xD;
      patient. This will be done at the initial education session and again at the four week follow&#xD;
      up session, for both the control and the intervention group. The sample size will be 60&#xD;
      participants, 30 for the control group and 30 for the intervention group.&#xD;
