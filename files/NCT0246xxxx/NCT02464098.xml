  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diarrhea is a common problem in the pediatric population. Children with cancer are especially&#xD;
      at increased risk for gastrointestinal infection-related morbidity and mortality due to their&#xD;
      ongoing immunosuppression. However, the epidemiology of diarrheal illnesses in&#xD;
      immunocompromised children is poorly understood. In the past, many or most cases of&#xD;
      gastroenteritis have gone undiagnosed, largely due to a lack of sensitive diagnostic tests&#xD;
      and a presumption that a large proportion of cases are due to treatment, rather than&#xD;
      infections. The availability of new diagnostic tests that detect many gastrointestinal&#xD;
      pathogens simultaneously offers the first opportunity to gain a comprehensive picture of the&#xD;
      causes of infectious diarrhea in children with cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital want to learn about the epidemiology of&#xD;
      diarrheal diseases in pediatric oncology patients utilizing broadly multiplexed, automated&#xD;
      PCR.&#xD;

      This study plans to enroll participants in two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  GROUP 1: Participants with hematologic malignancies or solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Participants who agree to take part in this research study will have stool samples&#xD;
                collected at diagnosis (baseline sample) and each month thereafter for 12 months&#xD;
                from the time of enrollment. Stool samples will be screened for different types of&#xD;
                microbes that may be present. For participants who develop diarrhea during these 12&#xD;
                months, three additional stool samples will be collected on Day 0, Day 7 and Day&#xD;
                14; two blood samples and mid-turbinate nasal swab will be collected as well on Day&#xD;
                0 and Day 7 of the first observed diarrheal episode to screen for additional&#xD;
                microbes that may be the cause of the diarrhea.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  GROUP 2: Participants who are hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Participants who agree to take part in this research study will have stool samples&#xD;
                collected within one week prior to conditional chemotherapy (baseline sample) and&#xD;
                weekly thereafter for a total of 16 weeks (pre- and early post-engraftment&#xD;
                periods), followed by monthly for 8 months. Stool samples will be screened for&#xD;
                different types of microbes that may be present. For participants who develop&#xD;
                diarrhea, three additional stool samples will be collected on Day 0, Day 7 and Day&#xD;
                14; two blood samples and mid-turbinate nasal swab will be collected as well on Day&#xD;
                0 and Day 7 of the first observed diarrheal episode to screen for additional&#xD;
                microbes that may be the cause of the diarrhea. For GROUP 2 participants, two&#xD;
                diarrheal episodes will be studied per patient: the first diarrheal episode during&#xD;
                the pre-engraftment period, and the first diarrheal episode during the&#xD;
                post-engraftment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with a change in cancer treatment plan enrolled on study: Group 1 participants&#xD;
      who experience a change in their cancer treatment plan necessitating an allogeneic stem cell&#xD;
      transplant will be taken off study for group 1 and offered the opportunity to consent to&#xD;
      group 2 Participants who chooses to then enroll on group 2 will complete the 12-month study&#xD;
      requirements as defined in the protocol for group 2 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General health information from participant medical records and other health-related&#xD;
      information about symptoms will also be obtained at the time of collection of the samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the prevalence of microbial pathogens in the stool of pediatric oncology&#xD;
           patients with diarrheal illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the clinical course, symptomatology, morbidity and mortality associated with&#xD;
           diarrheal diseases in pediatric oncology patients at St. Jude Children's Research&#xD;
           Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the performance of the multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for the&#xD;
           diagnosis of infectious diarrhea in comparison to the standard of care methods.&#xD;
