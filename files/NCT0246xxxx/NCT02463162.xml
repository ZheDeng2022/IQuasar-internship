  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Canadian population is aging and more people are living with advanced chronic diseases.&#xD;
      At the end of life (EOL), the use of invasive medical treatments in hospitals is increasing&#xD;
      and associated with worse outcomes. Advance Care Planning (ACP) may help improve care at EOL&#xD;
      to be the way patients want it. ACP is a process where people think about the various options&#xD;
      related to future health care decisions and they may communicate with a verbal or written&#xD;
      plan of what care they would want in the EOL. Also, they may nominate a substitute decision&#xD;
      maker if they become unable to speak for themselves. A national poll found that few Canadians&#xD;
      have thought about or made an ACP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alberta Health Services has developed two videos (Videos) to help with decision making about&#xD;
      ACP and goals of care designations(GCD). GCD are medical orders of care that (a) serve as a&#xD;
      communication tool for HCP to assist in rapid decision making; and (b) guide HCP and patients&#xD;
      regarding the general intent and locations of care, and interventions that are to be&#xD;
      provided. This study will compare ACP behaviours and GCD preferences for participants who&#xD;
      have seen the Videos with those who have not and measure the change in those behaviours and&#xD;
      preferences at 1, 2 and 3 months. It will also look at the impact of the Videos on health&#xD;
      care costs and service use. Participants from five patient groups (metastatic lung cancer,&#xD;
      colorectal cancer, gynecological cancer, renal failure, and heart failure) were selected as&#xD;
      representative of where ACP should ideally be occurring, and where data on ACP implementation&#xD;
      is presently most lacking, and as venues in which this research is most feasible. Collecting&#xD;
      information about patients' ACP and GCD preferences may help improve AHS decision making&#xD;
      tools and more generally help healthcare leaders plan ways to better engage patients in the&#xD;
      ACP process.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background: Respecting patients' preferences for treatment is a key component of high quality&#xD;
      end of life care. Alberta Health Services (AHS) has developed tools for public, patient and&#xD;
      healthcare provider (HCP) engagement and education (such as guidebooks, videos, and HCP&#xD;
      training modules) to support widespread engagement in advance care planning (ACP) and&#xD;
      determining Goals of Care Designation (GCD). However, none of these knowledge translation&#xD;
      (KT) tools have been validated and they have not been tailored to reflect barriers in the&#xD;
      local context.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ACP is defined as a communication process where people plan for a time when they cannot make&#xD;
      medical decisions for themselves. It includes thinking about and communicating their&#xD;
      preferences for future healthcare, which can include conversations with family and healthcare&#xD;
      providers, choosing and documenting an alternate decision maker, and/or documenting&#xD;
      preferences for healthcare for use in the event that person loses capacity for medical&#xD;
      decision-making. These discussions can occur both informally and formally. Goals of Care&#xD;
      Designations (GCD) are medical orders of care that (a) serve as a communication tool for HCP&#xD;
      to assist in rapid decision making; and (b) guide HCP and patients regarding the general&#xD;
      intent and locations of care, and interventions that are to be provided. Decisions about&#xD;
      goals of care usually arise over time through conversations between patients, family members&#xD;
      and the health care team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized controlled trial (RCT) will focus on the two Conversations Matter Video&#xD;
      decision-aids developed by AHS for people and their families. The first video is an 8-minute&#xD;
      video that describes the 5-steps of the ACP process. The second video is a 8-minute video&#xD;
      that illustrates the resuscitative, medical and comfort levels of care outlined in the&#xD;
      Alberta GCD policy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scope: This protocol relates to two of the research activities designed to evaluate the&#xD;
      impact of ACP/GCD. The first is an RCT to evaluate the effectiveness of two videos about ACP&#xD;
      and GCD. Participants will be recruited from settings where ACP should ideally be occurring,&#xD;
      and where data on ACP implementation is presently most lacking. The overall aim of the RCT is&#xD;
      to evaluate and refine these existing knowledge translation (KT) tools to optimize the&#xD;
      quality and frequency of patient education about and engagement in ACP and determining goals&#xD;
      of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second activity measures the economic impact of the Videos in these patient populations.&#xD;
      A significant proportion of health care resources are consumed at end of life. ACP, which&#xD;
      emphasizes discussions, combined with GCD, may have a greater impact than advance directives&#xD;
      alone. To be clear, the primary goal of ACP is not about cost containment, but rather, to&#xD;
      shift a culture of care toward a patient- and family-centered approach to medical&#xD;
      decision-making. Prospective data collection and analysis will give insight into personal and&#xD;
      intangible costs. It will allow for relatively precise measurement of health care savings,&#xD;
      and thereby inform health care systems on anticipated savings and prescribe shift of funding&#xD;
      necessary for appropriate resourcing in parts of the health care system that may see&#xD;
      increased activity because of ACP, while also improving quality of patient-centred outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The RCT will be an in-person intervention and survey at baseline, follow-up&#xD;
      telephone survey at one month and two months, and in-person survey at three months. At&#xD;
      baseline, researchers will assess function and ask about demographic information, quality of&#xD;
      life, advance care planning (ACP), and goals of care (GC) preferences and goals of care&#xD;
      designation orders (GCD). Participants will then be randomized between two arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. control or &quot;usual care&quot;; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. intervention whereby participant views two videos about ACP and GCD, respectively&#xD;
           (Videos).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surveys will be administered by research staff. The baseline intervention and survey will&#xD;
      take approximately 30 to 65 minutes, depending on which arm the participant is randomized to,&#xD;
      and be collected from up to 240 participants. At one, two and three months, follow up surveys&#xD;
      will be administered to collect data about health care services utilized, health care costs&#xD;
      incurred, and discussions about ACP and GC with their health care providers, lawyers,&#xD;
      financial advisors and/or clergy in the preceding month. The one and two month surveys will&#xD;
      be approximately 10-20 minutes in length. Three-month follow-up surveys will collect data&#xD;
      about ACP, GC preferences and GCD and will be approximately 20-40 minutes in length.&#xD;
      Researchers will also collect data from participants' electronic medical health records about&#xD;
      their diagnosis and co-morbidities, health services utilization and costs at 12 months prior&#xD;
      to baseline, baseline and approximately 12 months after baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine the effectiveness of the Videos by comparing the change from baseline to 1, 2&#xD;
           and 3 months of the number of participants who have had a conversation with a health&#xD;
           care provider about ACP or GCD between two groups, namely: those who receive no&#xD;
           intervention (usual care) and those who watch the Videos.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine the cost and economic consequences of the Videos by comparing the change from&#xD;
           12 months prior to baseline to and including baseline, to 1 month, 2, months, 3 months&#xD;
           and 12 months following baseline in health care utilization and costs between the two&#xD;
           groups described in Objective 1.&#xD;
