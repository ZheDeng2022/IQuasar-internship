    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, baseline and blinded controlled, one arm clinical study showing&#xD;
      the performance and safety of the UltraShape treatment for non-invasive fat and circumference&#xD;
      reduction at the flanks area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 60 Healthy subjects in up to 4 investigational sites will be enrolled in this study.&#xD;
      All subjects will undergo an assessment of their general health. During the treatment period,&#xD;
      subject's circumference and fat thickness will be measured and three successive bi-weekly&#xD;
      (two weeks interval) UltraShape treatments will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study subjects will undergo UltraShape treatments on the flanks area using the U-Sculpt&#xD;
      /VDF Transducer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the follow-up period visit will be conducted as follow: 4 weeks (4wk FU), 8 weeks (8wk&#xD;
      FU) and 16 weeks (16wk FU) post last treatment (Tx.3). Subject's circumference will be&#xD;
      measured in the measurements points according to the flanks treated area, circumference&#xD;
      reduction will be assessed at each visit. Additionally, a subject questionnaire will be&#xD;
      completed in each follow-up visit. Finally, photography will be performed under visible light&#xD;
      conditions of the front, right, left and back view. Most of the assessments will occur at&#xD;
      each of the visits to the clinic.&#xD;
