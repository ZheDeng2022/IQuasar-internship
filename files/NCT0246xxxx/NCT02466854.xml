    <textblock>
      The BleeMACS (Bleeding complications in a Multicenter registry of patients discharged with&#xD;
      diagnosis of Acute Coronary Syndrome) registry is an international observational database of&#xD;
      bleeding outcomes for patients who are discharged with diagnosis of ACS and underwent&#xD;
      Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI), including myocardial infarction or unstable angina.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BleeMACS registry enrolls a total of more than 15,000 patients, including data from 16&#xD;
      hospitals in 11 countries: North America (Canada), South America (Brazil) Europe (Germany,&#xD;
      Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Italy, Macedonia, Greece), and Asia (Japan and China).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The end-point of this study is to characterize patients at high risk of bleeding and to&#xD;
      develop a risk score to accurately predict the risk of major bleeding within the first year&#xD;
      after discharge from the hospital for an ACS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In December 2014, given the actual need for rigorous multicenter clinical investigation to&#xD;
      test the safety of antithrombotic and contemporary therapies in patients with acute coronary&#xD;
      syndromes (ACS), Dr. Sergio Raposeiras-Roubín and Dr. Emad Abu-Assi launched the BleeMACS&#xD;
      (Bleeding complications in a Multicenter registry of patients discharged with diagnosis of&#xD;
      Acute Coronary Syndrome) project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antithrombotic medication is commonly used for secondary prevention in patients following an&#xD;
      ACS. This therapy, along with the invasive strategies, has been proved as effective, although&#xD;
      it increases the risk of bleeding, which may counteract its benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A growing body of evidence has demonstrated that the risk of death in patients with ACS is&#xD;
      affected not only by recurrent ischemic events but also by major bleeding. Bleeding&#xD;
      complications is the downside of antithrombotic therapy, as they were consistently associated&#xD;
      with short- and long-term mortality, in addition to increase the risk of new thrombotic&#xD;
      events particularly due to temporary or permanent modification/suspension of antithrombotic&#xD;
      therapy, which is especially relevant in the first year after an ACS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, there are several risk scores for predicting bleeding at short-term (during the&#xD;
      hospitalization stage and at 30 days). However, at medium and long-term (i.e., ≤ 1 year),&#xD;
      there is no available predicting systems to help clinicians quantify the bleeding risk of&#xD;
      their patients. How could physicians predict the risk of bleeding after hospital discharge&#xD;
      for ACS?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this project was focused on helping clinicians to estimate the patient's&#xD;
      baseline risk of major bleeding within the first year following an ACS. The investigators aim&#xD;
      to identify the independent predictors of major bleeding at 1-year in order to develop a&#xD;
      user-friendly bleeding risk score. The scoring system that the investigators intended to&#xD;
      design using the data from the present registry would help clinicians in the decision-making&#xD;
      process by identifying the optimal antithrombotic strategy, focusing closer attention to the&#xD;
      patients with high risk of bleeding.&#xD;
