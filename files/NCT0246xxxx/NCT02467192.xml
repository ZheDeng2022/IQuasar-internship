  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diagnosis of pneumonia in the elderly is difficult because of the poor sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity of clinical signs as well as images from chest radiography (RT). New diagnostic&#xD;
      tools such as thoracic low-dose computed tomography (CT), which exposes the patient to a weak&#xD;
      dose of irradiation, could improve diagnosis. Moreover, low-dose CT could provide additional&#xD;
      accuracy in the etiological clarification of pneumonia in elderly people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a first step, the investigators aim to perform a 1 year (12 months of inclusion + 3 months&#xD;
      of follow-up) prospective study including the Divisions of Internal Medicine, Rehabilitation,&#xD;
      Geriatrics and Radiology of the University Hospitals of Geneva. In this study, patients &gt;65&#xD;
      years old with a clinical suspicion of low respiratory tract infection (LRTI) will be&#xD;
      included. They will be prescribed antimicrobial therapy. Both chest radiography and low-dose&#xD;
      thoracic CT will be performed within the first 72 hours after admission, as will blood tests&#xD;
      and a nasopharyngeal swab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinician's diagnosis, both before and after the results of the CT, will be compared at&#xD;
      the end of the study to the adjudication committee's diagnostic opinion which will have&#xD;
      access to all available clinical, laboratory and chest X-ray data and which will be&#xD;
      considered the gold standard. At the end of the study, all the CT images will be&#xD;
      blind-reviewed by two experts in radiology. The impact of CT scanning in the diagnosis of&#xD;
      pneumonia will be assessed, both for its sensitivity and specificity in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first 12 months of the study, all patients will undergo a systematic&#xD;
      nasopharyngeal swab at admission and at discharge, from which eluates will be conserved.&#xD;
      During the next 12 months, virological and bacteriological polymerase chain reactions (PCR)&#xD;
      will be performed, using new diagnostic tools, in order to determine the etiological&#xD;
      diagnosis in this population and to evaluate the impact of the new tools in the management of&#xD;
      pneumonia for this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of these data will allow clinical, radiological and microbiological correlation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The project's principal aim is to assess the impact of low-dose CT scanning versus chest&#xD;
      radiography in the diagnosis of pneumonia in elderly patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the secondary objectives is to estimate sensitivity and specificity of CT scanning in&#xD;
      pneumonia diagnosis in the elderly (gold standard: adjudication committee advice).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective study should be considered a preliminary feasibility study in preparation&#xD;
      for a future randomized clinical trial comparing patient management, antibiotic prescription&#xD;
      and clinical outcomes between one group of patients with LRTI randomized to routine thoracic&#xD;
      CT scan and one group randomized to usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second phase of this study will explore the etiologies of pneumonia in the elderly using&#xD;
      new diagnostic tools. This will lead to identify radiological patterns associated with&#xD;
      clinical presentation and microbiological results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: to estimate the impact of CT scanning in the diagnosis of pneumonia in&#xD;
      elderly patients, in a monocentric study (but within two sites, Service de Médecine Interne&#xD;
      Générale and Hôpital des Trois-Chêne).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives: to estimate sensitivity and specificity of CT scanning in pneumonia&#xD;
      diagnosis (gold standard: adjudication committee advice), and to identify microbiological&#xD;
      etiologies of pneumonia in the elderly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study-design: prospective interventional study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be managed according to HUG guidelines. Frontal (and lateral if possible) chest&#xD;
      radiography (RT) will be interpreted by the physician; he will assess the level of certainty&#xD;
      for a diagnosis of pneumonia on a Likert scale, as well as its localization. Subsequently, a&#xD;
      thoracic CT scan will be performed within the first 48-72 hours of admission, with conclusion&#xD;
      by a radiologist (on a Likert scale). After the CT scan, the physician will get the result&#xD;
      and assess a new level of certainty of diagnosis (on a Likert scale). If the clinician&#xD;
      changes his therapy, this will be noted on the case report form (CRF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo two nasopharyngeal swabs (on admission and discharge) for storage in a&#xD;
      biobank, and microbiological (bacteriological and viral) PCR will be performed at a later&#xD;
      date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed until day 90. Information concerning rehospitalization and death&#xD;
      will be obtained by review of the patient's medical chart and the civil registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the study, chest radiographs (RT) and CT will be blinded-analyzed by two&#xD;
      referring radiologists (MS and XM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      An adjudication committee (one internist, one infectiologist, one pneumologist) will review&#xD;
      patients' data in order to provide a gold standard diagnosis which will be made according to&#xD;
      international guidelines (8, 9): clinical symptoms, recent new abnormalities on chest&#xD;
      radiograph and outcome under antimicrobial therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the end of the clinical study, the virology group will analyze the eluates from the&#xD;
      nasopharyngeal swabs using new PCR tests. After completing routine PCR (Adenovirus,&#xD;
      Bocavirus, Coronavirus, Enterovirus, Influenza A and B viruses, Parainfluenza virus,&#xD;
      Parechovirus, Picornavirus, Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Mycoplasma&#xD;
      pneumoniae), two different bacterial PCR kits will be used to test each eluate (admission and&#xD;
      discharge): the Fast Track Diagnostics (FTD) Bacterial pneumonia CAP (for Community Acquired&#xD;
      Pneumonia) kit (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis,&#xD;
      Staphylococcus aureus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Legionella spp) and the&#xD;
      FTD Bacterial pneumonia HAP (for Hospital Acquired Pneumonia) kit (Klebsiella pneumoniae,&#xD;
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expenses of additional examinations will not be charged to the patient or to his health&#xD;
      insurance company, but will be paid for by the HUG within the framework fixed price for&#xD;
      hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessments by the physician, before and after CT scanning, will be compared: number of&#xD;
           upgraded or downgraded diagnoses; sensitivity and specificity of chest radiography RT&#xD;
           and CT; correlation between the physician and the radiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Descriptions of the etiologies of pneumonia, with number of viral and bacterial&#xD;
           pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical, radiological, microbiological correlations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Outcome (re-hospitalization, mortality) at 30 and 90 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that chest CT will upgrade the certainty of diagnosis in 19% of&#xD;
      cases (14). To significantly increase the level of diagnosis of pneumonia, 46 patients with&#xD;
      suspicion of pneumonia are needed (α = 0.05, β 0.1). The investigators estimate the rate of&#xD;
      pneumonia in this population to be 45% (15); this implies that 100 participants should be&#xD;
      enrolled in order to significantly increase the accuracy of diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion in this study could begin in June 2015, for 12 months, with the last follow-up for&#xD;
      the last patient coming after a total of 15 months (12 months plus 90 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated results:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators anticipated that low-dose CT scan will improve the diagnosis of pneumonia&#xD;
      in the elderly. The study's final objective is to prepare a second randomized study measuring&#xD;
      the impact of chest CT scans on the management of patients in two cohorts of patients - one&#xD;
      which only undergoes a chest X-ray, and one which only undergoes a CT scan - for assessing&#xD;
      diagnosis and treatment.&#xD;
