  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep deprivation slows reaction time, reduces vigilance and impairs judgment and information&#xD;
      processing. Chronic effects include metabolic dysfunction, cardiovascular disease and cancer.&#xD;
      Sleep deprivation affects quality of life when it causes errors in judgment, whether these&#xD;
      occur behind the wheel of an automobile or in a hospital. Armodafinil, a non-amphetamine&#xD;
      wakefulness promoting medication, indicated for excessive sleepiness associated with&#xD;
      obstructive sleep apnea, narcolepsy, and shift work sleep disorder is used to mitigate the&#xD;
      effects of sleep deprivation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will characterize the effect of armodafinil on driving simulator performance. The&#xD;
      effects of armodafinil compared to placebo will be studied in a double blind crossover trial&#xD;
      involving 10 healthy subjects with serial assessments at baseline and after extensive sleep&#xD;
      deprivation. Using simultaneous electroencephalogram (EEG) recording during simulated driving&#xD;
      and neurocognitive assessments of vigilance, the relationship between brain activity and&#xD;
      cognitive performance will be established.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      On the first study day, the subjects will come to the Clinical Research Center (CRC) early in&#xD;
      the morning. In the first 90 minutes (acclimation session) of the study day EEG electrodes&#xD;
      will be applied and EEG signals will be measured continuously throughout the session.&#xD;
      Subjects will be instructed of the controls and operation of the driving simulator and&#xD;
      perform a 10 minute test drive to familiarize with it. Afterwards they will perform a battery&#xD;
      of cognitive tests including the Motor Praxis Task, the Visual Object Learning Test, the&#xD;
      Fractal-2-Back, the Abstract Matching, the Line Orientation Test, the Digit-Symbol&#xD;
      Substitution Task, the Balloon Analog Risk Test, and the Psychomotor Vigilance Test to get&#xD;
      familiar with the cognitive tests. The cognitive battery will last approximately 25 minutes.&#xD;
      The collected data of the conditioning session won't be part of the analysis. The purpose of&#xD;
      the session is that subjects adapt to the measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the acclimation session, the resting baseline for the subjects will be measured&#xD;
      which will consist of a simultaneous assessment of cognitive performance and brain activity.&#xD;
      The subjects will first drive for 30 minutes on the driving simulator to establish a resting&#xD;
      baseline of the driving performance. Afterwards a resting baseline for cognitive tests will&#xD;
      be established to measure attention, vigilance, risk-taking and decision-making. EEG will be&#xD;
      recorded concurrently during driving and cognitive tests. No blood samples will be taken&#xD;
      during the assessment of the resting baseline. Subjects will be discharged from the CRC after&#xD;
      completion of the baseline session (approximately 2 hours) until the evening. During this&#xD;
      time subjects are not allowed to sleep and they will be informed to not consume any caffeine&#xD;
      containing products (e.g. Red Bull, coffee). Upon return to the CRC, the subjects will be&#xD;
      sleep deprived and supervised by at least one of the study coordinators and at least one&#xD;
      additional person to make sure the subjects don't fall asleep during the night.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following day, 24 hours after the resting baseline session, the fatigue baseline session&#xD;
      will start. Sessions of resting baseline and fatigue baseline will be scheduled for the same&#xD;
      time of day on two consecutive days to account for circadian alignment. The testing procedure&#xD;
      will be identical to the resting baseline session that means subjects will drive for 60&#xD;
      minutes on the driving simulator and perform the same cognitive tests as in the baseline&#xD;
      session. After completion of the fatigue baseline session, the study drug (armodafinil 250 mg&#xD;
      or placebo) will be administered. To determine the pharmacokinetics, blood samples will be&#xD;
      obtained prior to drug dosing and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 10 hours post-dose&#xD;
      through an intravenous catheter placed in the arm vein of the subjects. After study drug&#xD;
      intake subjects will perform 5 sessions on the driving simulator consisting of 30-minute&#xD;
      drives. The same battery of tests performed at baseline will be performed between the drives.&#xD;
      The tested cognitive abilities play an important role during driving and the investigators&#xD;
      will investigate to what extent sleep deprivation alters these abilities and how armodafinil&#xD;
      is able to counter the deteriorating effects of sleep deprivation on these capabilities.&#xD;
