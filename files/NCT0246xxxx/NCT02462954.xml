      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of ContraGel versus the&#xD;
      hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC) Universal Placebo gel when used with the Caya diaphragm during&#xD;
      two 7-day periods of daily use, the first without intercourse and the second with&#xD;
      intercourse.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This single-center randomized, parallel, Phase I study will compare the safety of ContraGel&#xD;
      delivered by the Caya diaphragm versus HEC universal placebo gel delivered by the Caya&#xD;
      diaphragm in approximately 24 healthy premenopausal women protected from pregnancy by female&#xD;
      sterilization. Women will use the assigned product during two 7-day periods of daily use, the&#xD;
      first without intercourse and the second with intercourse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each woman will be seen in approximately 6 visits and will be contacted via one scheduled&#xD;
      follow-up call after Visit 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Visit 1, volunteers will be consented and undergo procedures to confirm they are eligible&#xD;
      to continue in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Visit 2, once it has been confirmed that the participant meets all of the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria and none of the exclusion criteria, baseline genital tract samples will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Visit 3,baseline genital tract samples will be taken for Test Cycle 1 (before product use&#xD;
      with no intercourse). Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to insert the Caya&#xD;
      diaphragm to deliver either ContraGel or the HEC placebo every day for two 7-day periods in&#xD;
      two separate menstrual cycles. The participant will receive study supplies. She will be&#xD;
      instructed to refrain from intercourse during the first 7-day period and to insert the Caya&#xD;
      each day for between 6-12 hours. She will be instructed to return to the clinic at Visit 4&#xD;
      with the diaphragm in place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Visit 4, genital tract samples will be taken after 7 days of product use without&#xD;
      intercourse (Test Cycle 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Visit 5, baseline genital tract samples will be taken for Test Cycle 2 (before product use&#xD;
      with intercourse). The participant will receive study supplies and will be instructed to&#xD;
      engage in two sex acts during this 7-day period, the second sex act to take place using the&#xD;
      study products 6-12 hours prior to Visit 6. Participants will be instructed to return to the&#xD;
      clinic at Visit 6 with the diaphragm still in place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Visit 6, genital tract samples will be taken after 7 days of product use with intercourse&#xD;
      (Test Cycle 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A follow-up call/contact will be scheduled for 1 to 2 weeks after Visit 6. The participant&#xD;
      will be asked about any adverse events (AEs) experienced and medications taken since the last&#xD;
      visit. The participant will then be exited from the study, unless she has symptoms that&#xD;
      require follow-up.&#xD;
