      The purpose of this study is to determine which Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) tools&#xD;
      patients with medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) find most helpful. The study will compare a&#xD;
      generic cancer QoL tool with those developed for thyroid cancer patients and neuroendocrine&#xD;
      tumour (NET) patients. The study will also evaluate clinicians' opinions on the clinical&#xD;
      usefulness of the QoL tools.&#xD;

      Background Currently available thyroid cancer quality of life (QoL) tools tend to be focused&#xD;
      on issues more relevant to patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) rather than&#xD;
      medullary thyroid cancer (MTC). As MTC is a neuroendocrine tumour (NET) patients often have&#xD;
      symptoms more in common with patients with these types of tumours rather than patients with&#xD;
      other types of thyroid cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MTC presents as a sporadic tumour in approximately 75% of cases and as an inherited disease&#xD;
      in 25%. The inherited forms of MTC constitute part of the Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia&#xD;
      disorders. Patients with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia (MEN) may therefore have a number of&#xD;
      medical conditions which can impact on their quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with rare diseases can face additional barriers and concerns such as limited patient&#xD;
      information resources, the potential for lack of understanding amongst family and friends and&#xD;
      they will inevitably encounter healthcare professionals who do not have experience of&#xD;
      managing their rare condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It can be difficult to fully appreciate the impact of a cancer diagnosis or an inherited&#xD;
      syndrome, raised and rising tumour markers and disease symptoms on a patient's quality of&#xD;
      life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life is multi faceted and is affected by emotional, social and functional issues&#xD;
      as well as disease related problems. Quality of life tools can increase the information a&#xD;
      healthcare professional obtains about a patient thus facilitating the consultation as well as&#xD;
      improving the patient's satisfaction with the consultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with raised or rising tumour markers (calcitonin and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA))&#xD;
      often remain physically well and of good performance status but there can be a significant&#xD;
      amount of distress associated with the awareness of abnormal or worsening biochemical&#xD;
      results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once MTC has spread beyond the neck, curative options are lacking and the aim of treatment&#xD;
      switches to maintenance of quality of life and palliation of symptoms. Therapeutic&#xD;
      interventions may include somatostatin analogue therapy, radiolabelled therapy such as mIBG&#xD;
      therapy or targeted therapy using tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as vandetanib and&#xD;
      cabozantinib. It can be difficult to decide when to start systemic targeted therapy as the&#xD;
      drugs themselves can have significant toxicities which can impact on quality of life and they&#xD;
      have only been shown to achieve a modest increase in progression free survival and not&#xD;
      overall survival. These agents are taken orally on a daily basis and treatment can extend for&#xD;
      years in some cases. If the investigators had a robust tool to assess MTC related QOL&#xD;
      clinicians may find it easier to select those patients who will benefit most from systemic&#xD;
      anti cancer therapies as opposed to more simple supportive symptomatic measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to determine which Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) instruments&#xD;
      patients with sporadic and inherited MTC and early and advanced stage medullary thyroid&#xD;
      cancer patients find most helpful in facilitating communication of their health problems to&#xD;
      their clinicians. The study will attempt to ascertain if this patient cohort's symptoms and&#xD;
      quality of life is better assessed by a thyroid cancer specific questionnaire, a general&#xD;
      symptom questionnaire or a neuroendocrine tumour specific questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will also ascertain clinician's views on the quality of life tools in terms of&#xD;
      their ability to highlight problems not otherwise ascertained by a standard clinical review&#xD;
      appointment along with the relationship between quality of life tool score, performance&#xD;
      status and disease burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomised to complete four quality of life questionnaires in different&#xD;
      sequences and then will be asked questions about which questionnaire they prefer in a final&#xD;
      brief questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questionnaires will be presented to the participant in random order to counterbalance the&#xD;
      effects of boredom and habituation. A trained nurse or researcher will be available to assist&#xD;
      with the completion of the questionnaires when required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A small cohort of study participants (approx 10-15) will undergo cognitive interviews. This&#xD;
      will help test the functionality of the survey questions. The interviews will take the format&#xD;
      of retrospective probes i.e. directed questions undertaken by a member of the research team&#xD;
      after the participant has completed all the questionnaires. The aim is identify problems not&#xD;
      covered by the questionnaires, problems with terminology and comprehension as well as&#xD;
      assessing the ability of the participants to successfully rank the 4 quality of life tools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      o Primary outcome measure: Identification of medullary thyroid cancer patients' preferred&#xD;
      quality of life instrument for describing their concerns and for facilitating communication&#xD;
      with their health care professional. Assessed by patients' ranking of the questionnaires from&#xD;
      1-4 (with 1 representing the most favoured tool).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  assess if there are differences between preferred quality of life tools amongst sporadic&#xD;
           and inherited MTC patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  correlate quality of life questionnaire scores with performance status, disease stage&#xD;
           and burden, calcitonin doubling time&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  assess clinicians' views on the quality of life tools in terms of their ability to&#xD;
           highlight problems not otherwise ascertained by a standard clinical review appointment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility: 200 patients required&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients 16 years old or over who have a diagnosis of medullary thyroid cancer&#xD;
           (inherited or sporadic)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients can be included at any time point after diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who have differentiated (papillary or follicular) thyroid cancer or anaplastic&#xD;
           thyroid cancer or lymphoma of the thyroid.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who do not sufficiently understand the English language or patients with&#xD;
           learning disabilities, as these are standardised and validated questionnaires that are&#xD;
           in English.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of Life Questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will utilise both generic quality of life instruments as well as disease specific&#xD;
      ones. The generic instrument will be EORTC QLQ-C30 and the disease specific tools will be the&#xD;
      MD Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI) thyroid module and the City of Hope Quality of Life&#xD;
      Scale/THYROID (amended) which assess thyroid cancer issues and EORTC QLQ-GINET21 which&#xD;
      assesses issues relevant to neuroendocrine tumours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) EORTC QLQ-C30 core quality of life questionnaire is designed to measure cancer patients'&#xD;
      physical, psychological and social functions. The questionnaire is composed of multi-item&#xD;
      scales and single items. It focuses on the QoL consequences of physical limitations and on&#xD;
      clinical symptoms. It is a generic measure, as opposed to one that targets a specific&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii) MD Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI) thyroid module is a patient reported outcome&#xD;
      measure that assesses the severity of multiple symptoms and the impact of symptoms on daily&#xD;
      functioning during the last 24 hours. The 1-10 point rating scale is comprised of the 13 core&#xD;
      items, 6 thyroid specific symptoms and 5 psychosocial items. Completion of the measure is&#xD;
      simple and takes only a few minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii) The City of Hope Quality of Life Scale/THYROID (amended) Questions relate to specific&#xD;
      issues of concern to thyroid patients regarding the condition itself, treatment and side&#xD;
      effects. Items cover physical, psychological, social and spiritual domains. It is an&#xD;
      established instrument specifically designed for use with thyroid patients. The original tool&#xD;
      used some questions relevant to differentiated thyroid cancer treatment which are not&#xD;
      relevant to MTC patients so these have been substituted for questions specific to the&#xD;
      management of MTC. These amendments are not therefore part of the validated tool but are&#xD;
      believed to be important and relevant to this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iv) EORTC QLQ-GINET21This has been reported to be a responsive tool for assessing quality of&#xD;
      life for neuroendocrine tumours arising in the gastrointestinal tract, pancreas and liver. A&#xD;
      significant proportion of patients with advanced medullary thyroid cancer experience&#xD;
      gastrointestinal symptoms related to hypercalcitoninaemia so this study is an opportunity to&#xD;
      assess if this QOL tool is relevant and helpful in describing quality of life concerns for&#xD;
      MTC patients who have a different form of neuroendocrine tumour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients Preference&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completing each of the four questionnaires, patients are asked to answer a few&#xD;
      additional brief questions to assess whether they found that particular questionnaire useful,&#xD;
      as well as questions regarding questionnaire characteristics (length, ease of understanding&#xD;
      and relevance to health problems). There is also a free text area for comments on areas&#xD;
      patients may consider important but which are not covered by the questionnaires. After&#xD;
      completing all 4 questionnaires patients are asked to evaluate all of the quality of life&#xD;
      tools in a final short series of questions and to rank the QoL tools in order, 1-4, with 1&#xD;
      being the QoL tool they found most helpful and 4 for the QoL tool which was least helpful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Publication&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of the trial will be shared with the clinical community via publications in&#xD;
      peer-reviewed journals and presentations at national/international meetings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any publications or presentations arising directly as a result of this project will&#xD;
      acknowledge all contributing investigators and funders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Support&#xD;
&#xD;
      The QaLM protocol has been reviewed by members of the NCRI Thyroid Cancer Subgroup, Thyroid&#xD;
      Cancer Support Group Wales, Butterfly Thyroid Cancer Trust and AMEND. Widespread support has&#xD;
      been expressed from clinicians and patient representatives alike and to date 16 leading UK&#xD;
      thyroid cancer teams have expressed interest in participating in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is anticipated that the QaLM study would be eligible for inclusion in the National Cancer&#xD;
      Research Institute's (NCRI) Thyroid Cancer Trial portfolio which would facilitate the&#xD;
      multicentre participation and recruitment required for successful completion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study proposal was presented at a NCRI Thyroid Cancer Subgroup research meeting in&#xD;
      October 2014 and leading UK clinicians requested that the number of patients recruited be&#xD;
      increased from 100 to 200 to take in to account the unique opportunity to offer a study to&#xD;
      this patient group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biochemical monitoring (calcitonin and CEA) forms a routine part of the investigation and&#xD;
      follow up of patients with medullary thyroid cancer and it is known that the rate of change&#xD;
      in biochemical markers can predict likely survival. It is not known however if there is any&#xD;
      association between biochemical marker changes and quality of life. This project would be a&#xD;
      unique opportunity to compare and contrast issues faced by patients with MTC arising as part&#xD;
      of Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia and those where MTC arises sporadically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the era of new systemic therapies in the form of oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor drugs,&#xD;
      that are potentially taken long term, require frequent monitoring when initiated and have&#xD;
      significant potential toxicities, it would be beneficial to try and quantify and compare the&#xD;
      problems caused by the disease and those caused by systemic therapy. Quality of life is&#xD;
      paramount and the investigators currently lack information on the burden of disease and&#xD;
      treatment. This information could help commissioners appraise new therapies and be used&#xD;
      alongside clinical and cost effectiveness data.&#xD;
