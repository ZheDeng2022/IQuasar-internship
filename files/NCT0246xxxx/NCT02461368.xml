      The investigators compared the results of the ultrasound-guided anterior and posterior&#xD;
      approaches to administer glenohumeral steroid injections to patients with primary adhesive&#xD;
      capsulitis of the shoulder joint by a single experienced provider.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study was a randomized controlled trial of 50 patients, who underwent history taking,&#xD;
      physical examinations, x-rays, and MRI or ultrasonography, and were diagnosed with primary&#xD;
      adhesive capsulitis of the shoulder from December 2012 to November 2013. The 50 patients were&#xD;
      assigned to Group I (anterior approach) or Group II (posterior approach) under double-blinded&#xD;
      randomization. The randomization was performed by an independent nurse using a computerized&#xD;
      random sequence generator. The operators who participated in the procedure were blinded to&#xD;
      the participant's information. The injection mixture for both groups was: 1 mL triamcinolone,&#xD;
      4 mL lidocaine, 4 mL normal saline, and 3 mL Omnipaque (Iohexol, General Electronics&#xD;
      Healthcare). After the injection, anteroposterior, scapular lateral, and axillary x-rays of&#xD;
      the shoulder were taken of all patients within 15 min, and leakage was classified into three&#xD;
      categories by a musculoskeletal radiologist with 18 years experience: 1) no leakage; 2)&#xD;
      leakage; and 3) cannot be determined. Injection accuracy was defined as [number of 1) ÷&#xD;
      {number of 1) + number of 2) + number of 3)}] × 100 (%). The frequency of needling until the&#xD;
      injection had been completed was checked. A visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, range of&#xD;
      motion (ROM), patient's satisfaction (SAT), the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES)&#xD;
      shoulder score, and the Constant score were recorded before, and 3, 7, and 13 weeks after the&#xD;
      injection. VAS scores range from 0 to 10, with 0 being no pain and 10 being the most severe&#xD;
      pain ever experienced. Internal rotation was measured from buttock to T5 in this study, with&#xD;
      the range between L5 and T5 being allocated a sequential value between 2 and 13 and the range&#xD;
      below the first sacral vertebra being allocated 1. SAT was also selected from a scale of 0 to&#xD;
      10, with 0 being unsatisfactory and 10 being very satisfactory. Stick exercises were started&#xD;
      at 3 weeks, and theraband exercises were started 7 weeks after the injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two patients of 54 patients who had been assessed for eligibility in this study were excluded&#xD;
      due to proximal humerus fractures of the affected shoulders. And another two participants&#xD;
      were excluded because they had declined to participate. One Group I patient was excluded due&#xD;
      to an additional subacromial injection 3 weeks after the study injection. And another Group I&#xD;
      patient was excluded due to loss of follow-up before 13 weeks. Also, two patients were&#xD;
      excluded from Group II because of loss to follow-up. Finally, 46 patients were included in&#xD;
      the study (n = 23/group). The demographic data of the two groups were not significantly&#xD;
      different.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnostic ultrasonography was performed by a musculoskeletal radiologist with 18 years&#xD;
      experience using ultrasound (Philips Healthcare) before the injection. The ultrasound-guided&#xD;
      glenohumeral steroid injection was administered by a shoulder and elbow surgeon who performed&#xD;
      more than 2,000 similar procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 21-gauge spinal needle was used for all of the ultrasound-guided steroid injections. The&#xD;
      patient was supine with the shoulder slightly rotated externally for the anterior approach.&#xD;
      The shoulder was draped in sterile fashion using 70% alcohol and povidone-iodine solution.&#xD;
      The linear ultrasonography probe (General Electronics Healthcare) was prepared with 70%&#xD;
      alcohol and a thin layer of sterile ultrasonographic transmission gel (Republic of Korea).&#xD;
      The needle was inserted at the level of the coracoids, from lateral to medial, and was aimed&#xD;
      at the medial border of the humeral head, parallel to the longitudinal axis of the probe. The&#xD;
      posterior approach was performed with the patient in the lateral decubitus position on the&#xD;
      unaffected side, leaning 45 degree anteriorly and hugging a pillow. The needle was inserted&#xD;
      from lateral to medial, parallel to the longitudinal axis of the probe, and into the joint&#xD;
      between the humeral head and the posterior glenoid labrum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants took off their coats and shirts in the injection room. Females wore a skirt&#xD;
      at the axillary level exposing the shoulder for injection. The provider entered the injection&#xD;
      room and positioned the patients appropriately. Just after positioning, the operator put on&#xD;
      gloves, prepared the injection mixture, and administered the injection. Positioning time&#xD;
      (from operator entering the room until the end of positioning) and injection time (from&#xD;
      putting on gloves until just after the injection) were recorded by an independent nurse. The&#xD;
      sum of the two times was recorded as the total time, and the frequency of needling during the&#xD;
      injection for one patient was also recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A power analysis indicated that a sample size of 46 patients (23/group) would provide a&#xD;
      statistical power of 80%, with a two-sided α level of 0.05 to detect a significant difference&#xD;
      in the improvement of ASES score between initial and 13 weeks after injection, assuming an&#xD;
      effect size of 0.85 (mean difference, 16.1; standard deviation, 19.0). This was based on the&#xD;
      mean and standard deviation of the improvement of ASES score between initial and 13 weeks&#xD;
      after injection observed in a pilot study of 20 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare preoperative and postoperative data.&#xD;
      Normally distributed data between the groups were analyzed using the independent sample&#xD;
      t-test. Otherwise, the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U-test was used. Statistical analyses were&#xD;
      performed with SPSS ver. 13.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA). A p value &lt; 0.05 was&#xD;
      considered statistically significant.&#xD;

    <description>Injection material includes 3cc Omnipaque, therefore, the accuracy of injection can be checked just after the injection. After the injection, anteroposterior, scapular lateral, and axillary x-rays of the shoulder were taken of all patients within 15 min, and leakage was classified into three categories by a musculoskeletal radiologist with 18 years experience: 1) no leakage; 2) leakage; and 3) cannot be determined.</description>
