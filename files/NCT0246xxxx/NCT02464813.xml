  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the incidence of longterm pain after spinal fusion surgery in&#xD;
      children and adolescents. In the second part of the study a randomized double-blind clinical&#xD;
      trial will be conducted. We compare the effect of pregabalin versus placebo on postoperative&#xD;
      pain and oxycodone consumption. We will also be able to evaluate the effect of pregabalin on&#xD;
      neurophysiological monitoring during surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is the most common indication for major surgery during&#xD;
      adolescence. Postoperative pain is a major concern in these adolescents with major surgical&#xD;
      trauma. Spinal cord monitoring is an essential part of spinal deformity correction, but the&#xD;
      effects of pregabalin on these measurements are not known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to evaluate the incidence of longterm postoperative pain in children after spinal&#xD;
      surgery the first part of our study will be retrospective. We will send a symptom and pain&#xD;
      questionnaire to all children, who have been in spinal fusion surgery at our university&#xD;
      hospital between the years 2009-2015. The questionnaire will include Oswestry Low Back Pain&#xD;
      Questionnaire, pain drawing and SRS-24. The Oswestry Disability Index is currently considered&#xD;
      by many as the gold standard for measuring degree of disability and estimating quality of&#xD;
      life in a person with low back pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second part of our study a randomized double-blind clinical trial will be conducted&#xD;
      comparing the effect of pregabalin and placebo on postoperative pain and oxycodone&#xD;
      consumption. In addition the effect of pregabalin on neurophysiological monitoring in&#xD;
      adolescents undergoing surgery for spinal deformities will be assessed. Finally, the&#xD;
      prevalence of persistent postsurgical pain will be evaluated at 6, 12 and 24 months after&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To obtain statistical power of 80% and a type I-error level of 0.05, 60 adolescents (30 in&#xD;
      control and 30 in active treatment group) will be recruited according to CONSORT guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of pregabalin given twice preoperatively and&#xD;
      for five days postoperatively on postoperative pain. Pain will be measured using visual&#xD;
      analogue scale (VAS). Oxycodone administered using patient controlled anesthesia (PCA) will&#xD;
      be used for analgesia. Persistent pain at 6, 12 and 24 months will also be evaluated. In&#xD;
      addition, the effect of preoperative pregabalin on motor evoked potentials (latency,&#xD;
      amplitude, currency needed to evoke potentials) during spinal cord monitoring as well as&#xD;
      perioperative EEG findings and on the consumption of anesthetics.&#xD;
