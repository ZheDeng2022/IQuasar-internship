    <textblock>
      This study was designed to determine the heal rate of diabetic foot ulcers at 4 weeks, and&#xD;
      complete closure at 8 and 12 weeks of patients treated with either NuShield or Affinity&#xD;
      compared to standard care alone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a three (3)-arm evaluation in 100 patients over 3 facilities with diabetic foot&#xD;
      ulcers (DFU). Patients will be treated with NuShield or Affinity together with standard&#xD;
      therapy or with standard care alone. For the purposes of this evaluation, standard therapy&#xD;
      will consist of extensive debridement of nonviable tissue, saline-moistened non-occlusive&#xD;
      dressing, off-loading to decrease pressure on extremity, aggressive treatment of infection&#xD;
      and arterial revascularization if indicated. The patients will receive NuShield or Affinity&#xD;
      plus standard therapy to determine optimal application method. The evaluation duration is 4&#xD;
      weeks with 8-week and 12-week follow-up visits. Patients with diabetic neuropathic foot&#xD;
      ulcers of at least 4 weeks duration and free of clinical signs of infection at the time of&#xD;
      treatment may be eligible for inclusion. At Week -1, each patient will undergo aggressive,&#xD;
      surgical debridement. The site should be free of fibrin, necrotic and callous tissue. Digital&#xD;
      imaging and planimetery of the target ulcer will be performed pre- and post initial&#xD;
      debridement and at each subsequent visit as per the evaluation schedule. This evaluation is&#xD;
      designed to investigate the potential of an allogeneic placental-derived amniotic membrane to&#xD;
      accelerate healing of lower extremity DFU when used in conjunction with standard therapy.&#xD;
      This potential will be measured as an increase in the rate of healing (daily decrease in&#xD;
      percent wound area/volume compared to initial debrided ulcer area/volume) of patients treated&#xD;
      with NuShield or Affinity plus standard wound care compared to patients treated with standard&#xD;
      good wound care alone. Studies by Margolis and co-workers have demonstrated that the use of&#xD;
      this surrogate marker, measured at 4 and 8 weeks of care, is predictive (&gt;70%) of wound&#xD;
      healing in patients with DFU at the 20th week of care. [Kantor 1998; Margolis 2003] The&#xD;
      secondary endpoint will be patients achieving complete closure (100%) by week 12.&#xD;
