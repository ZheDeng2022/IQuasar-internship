  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending (SAD), and multiple&#xD;
      ascending dose (MAD) study conducted at a single clinical site within the UK. Healthy male&#xD;
      and female subjects (on non-child bearing potential) will be enrolled to investigate single&#xD;
      inhaled doses of molgramostim at 3 dose levels (Part 1) and multiple inhaled doses at 2 dose&#xD;
      levels (Part 2). The 2 doses in the multiple ascending dose regimens will be administered&#xD;
      once daily (QD) for 6 consecutive days. The clinical indication for inhaled molgramostim is&#xD;
      the treatment of respiratory diseases such as aPAP, bronchiectasis and cystic fibrosis. The&#xD;
      Clinical trial will involve 42 healthy participants. The trial is expected to last&#xD;
      approximately 4 months.&#xD;
