      1. To determine the lowest nasal cannula flow rate in which upper airway deadspace is&#xD;
           reduced. Hypothesis - The lowest flow rate of high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) will reduce&#xD;
           upper airway (extrathoracic) deadspace and improve respiratory efficiency by reducing&#xD;
           transcutaneous CO2 and/or lower respiratory rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the lowest nasal cannula flow rate in which regional distribution (as&#xD;
           defined by EIT) of ventilation changes. Hypothesis - Moderate to high flow rates will&#xD;
           create positive pressure that leads to improved regional distribution of ventilation.&#xD;

      Background and Significance Historically, oxygen nasal cannulae have been used in hypoxemic&#xD;
      patients as a therapy to increase arterial oxygenation. In the neonatal community, oxygen&#xD;
      flows &gt;2 L/min and &gt; 4 L/min in the pediatric patient have seldom been used due to the&#xD;
      potential for excessive drying of the nasal mucosae and risk for developing hypothermia. It&#xD;
      has been speculated that larger pediatric and adult patients are able to better tolerate flow&#xD;
      rates in excess of 4 L/min because the large nasal mucosal surface area can support hydration&#xD;
      of dry medical grade gases. High flow nasal cannula (HFNC) therapy is a form of respiratory&#xD;
      support that provides flows that are believed to be in excess of a patient's spontaneous&#xD;
      inspiratory and expiratory flow rates. In the last decade, a proliferation of&#xD;
      heated-humidified high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) devices has been introduced into the&#xD;
      clinical setting. These devices are intended to provide optimal heating and humidification of&#xD;
      medical gases and regardless of flow setting. In the case of neonates, which has been the&#xD;
      predominant patient population receiving HFNC, there clearly is no consensus on which flows&#xD;
      constitute &quot;high&quot; in this population. If &quot;high&quot; is intended to mean a flow rate that exceeds&#xD;
      spontaneous inspiratory flow rate then there is no reasonable clinical measurement to&#xD;
      ascertain this relationship. Thus, the true definition of HFNC remains an elusive term and&#xD;
      our protocol hopes to shed some light on this subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our prospective randomized trial of the effects of 3 different oxygen nasal cannula flow&#xD;
      rates (low, medium, and high) on respiratory rate, SPO2, transcutaneous CO2 and regional&#xD;
      distribution of ventilation as measured by EIT will help clinicians define a range of HFNC&#xD;
      flow rates in which deadspace washout occurs without positive distending pressure (low range)&#xD;
      and in which deadspace washout occurs with positive pressure that creates regional&#xD;
      distribution of ventilation changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Preliminary Studies One neonatal source defines HFNC as flows &gt; 1 L/min and another&#xD;
      defines flows &gt;3 L/min as HFNC.1 Classification is further complicated in larger pediatric&#xD;
      and adult patients where flows during HFNC have been reported to be in excess of those&#xD;
      traditionally used with a standard nasal cannula ~ 6 L/min) and as high as 30-40 L/min.2 With&#xD;
      the technologic ability to provide better heat and humidity, clinicians have found that HFNC&#xD;
      may be able to support a larger fraction of patients that would otherwise require continuous&#xD;
      positive airway pressure (CPAP), noninvasive ventilation (NIV), or invasive mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation. There are several proposed mechanisms by which HFNC may provide greater&#xD;
      respiratory assistance than standard oxygen delivery devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Flows that exceed the expiratory flow rate may provide &quot;back-pressure&quot; at the nasal airway&#xD;
      opening during exhalation that is similar to nasal CPAP. Additionally, gases may provide a&#xD;
      physiologic purging of carbon dioxide from the anatomic dead space via anatomic leak&#xD;
      (nasal/oral airway). These effects are likely to vary based on the flow, minute ventilation,&#xD;
      patient size, leak, and nasal airway opening/prong size relationship. There are currently&#xD;
      three FDA approved HFNC systems. Clinical acceptance is related to the fact that HFNC is less&#xD;
      expensive, simpler to operate and requires a less complicated airway interface than a&#xD;
      standard CPAP or NIV device. Another proposed benefit is that HFNC prongs are generally less&#xD;
      occlusive and may cause less nasal airway injury than CPAP prongs or a BiPAP mask. The&#xD;
      widespread acceptance and use of this approach has been implemented with very little&#xD;
      experimental data to support HFNC flow settings as a safe and effective option in all&#xD;
      patients with hypoxic respiratory failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) Electrical impedance tomography capitalizes on changes&#xD;
      in impendence in air-filled versus tissue-filled spaces to characterize and quantify regional&#xD;
      distribution of lung volume at the bedside. This technology has been validated in animal3 and&#xD;
      human4, 5 studies performed over the past decade at Boston Children's Hospital. The&#xD;
      technology utilizes a series of 16 electrodes placed across the patient's chest (Figure 1).&#xD;
      As small currents are passed between the electrodes, impedance is measured between and&#xD;
      amongst the series. Through a complex interrogation and manipulation of these impedance&#xD;
      values, a two-dimensional image is formed (Figure 2), and has been shown to correlate with&#xD;
      clinical and radiographic changes in patients4. The ability to estimate lung volume and&#xD;
      regional distribution of gas non-invasively and in real time may give us insight as to what&#xD;
      mode of ventilation is more effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physiologic effects and safety of HFNC There are several proposed physiologic mechanisms by&#xD;
      which HFNC is believed to be effective. These include: 1) flushing the upper airway deadspace&#xD;
      of CO2, allowing for better alveolar gas exchange; 2) providing a flow adequate to support&#xD;
      inspiration therefore reducing inspiratory work of breathing; 3) improving lung and airway&#xD;
      mechanics by eliminating the effects of drying/cooling; 4) reducing or eliminating the&#xD;
      metabolic cost of gas conditioning; and 5) providing positive expiratory distending pressure.&#xD;
      While these variables have been measured in either animals or humans, short-term studies only&#xD;
      enrolled small numbers of subjects and were not specifically designed to address safety of&#xD;
      HFNC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hasan et al observed the effects of pressure generated in a static neonatal lung model using&#xD;
      two commercially available HFNC devices with flows between 0-12 L/min and at different leak&#xD;
      settings.6 They demonstrated in a nares model where leak was minimized (mouth closed) that a&#xD;
      systematic increase in simulated tracheal pressures was proportional to increased flows. The&#xD;
      measured airway pressures were similar to those reported with nasal CPAP (~5-6 cmH2O at flows&#xD;
      of ~6-8 L/min).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Frizzola and colleagues measured tracheal pressures and gas exchange in 13 lung-injured&#xD;
      neonatal piglets supported by N-CPAP and HFNC under high-leak and low-leak conditions.7 The&#xD;
      major finding of this study was that HFNC tracheal pressures were comparable to CPAP&#xD;
      pressures at the same flow range, and washout of nasopharyngeal dead space is associated with&#xD;
      improved ventilation and oxygenation independent of tracheal pressure alone during HFNC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of short-term studies have evaluated the magnitude of distending pressure in the&#xD;
      lung in a small group of infants. Sreenan et al found that similar end expiratory pleural&#xD;
      pressures could be maintained between a standard oxygen delivery nasal cannula (1-2.5 L/min)&#xD;
      and N-CPAP in a group of 40 premature infants with no differences in desaturations,&#xD;
      bradycardia, and apnea.8 However, this pressure is likely to be highly variable due to leak&#xD;
      and airway/cannula size relationship. Lampland observed similar end-expiratory pleural&#xD;
      pressures between HFNC (2-6 L/min) and N-CPAP 6 cm H2O in premature neonates.9 A recent&#xD;
      Cochrane meta-analysis evaluated prospective, randomized controlled trials that were limited&#xD;
      to the premature infant population.1 The primary objective of this meta-analysis was to&#xD;
      determine safety and efficacy of HFNC. When used as primary respiratory support after birth,&#xD;
      one trial found similar rates of treatment failure in infants treated with HFNC (5-6 L/min)&#xD;
      and nasal CPAP.10 Following extubation, one trial found that infants treated with HFNC (1.8&#xD;
      L/min) had a significantly greater need for reintubation than those treated with nasal&#xD;
      CPAP.11 Another trial found similar rates of reintubation for humidified and non-humidified&#xD;
      HFNC (~ 2-3 L/min)12 and the fourth trial found no difference between two different models of&#xD;
      equipment used to deliver humidified HFNC (6 L/min).13 There were few patients enrolled in&#xD;
      these studies and in two studies (Woodhead, Miller) poor methodological approaches were used.&#xD;
      In one study enrollment was stopped short due to infections related to the HFNC device being&#xD;
      used.10 Based on these findings, there is insufficient evidence to establish the safety or&#xD;
      effectiveness of HFNC within the range of commonly used flows, and as a form of respiratory&#xD;
      support in preterm infants. Also, these data demonstrate that when used following extubation,&#xD;
      HFNC may be associated with a higher rate of reintubation than nasal CPAP.14 There have been&#xD;
      no studies evaluating safety and efficacy in larger infants and other pediatric patients.&#xD;
      Despite the lack of supporting evidence, HFNC is still being implemented in many pediatric&#xD;
      intensive care units (PICU) using flows ≥ 20 L/min and few adult studies have been conducted&#xD;
      using these high flows during HFNC. Thus, it is difficult to extrapolate these findings to&#xD;
      promote the use of similar flows in children. It is apparent that HFNC may provide some of&#xD;
      the same clinical benefits as CPAP or even NIV with a less complicated nasal airway or&#xD;
      naso-oral interface. While nasal CPAP serves as an intermediary form of support between&#xD;
      oxygen therapy and invasive ventilation in neonates, it is more common for larger pediatrics&#xD;
      and adults to be supported with bi-level NIV as an alternative to invasive ventilation. There&#xD;
      is compelling data to also support the use of NIV in the neonatal population to augment the&#xD;
      ventilation effects of nasal CPAP. HFNC not only provides a baseline pressure similar to CPAP&#xD;
      but it also augments alveolar ventilation to a level that may be similar to NIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D. Design and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. In a prospective, randomized trial of three different flow rates of HFNC we will&#xD;
           evaluate the outcome of EIT regional distribution, transcutaneous CO2, and respiratory&#xD;
           rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patient Selection and Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. Inclusion Criteria i. All patients who are receiving HFNC for hypoxia ii. Age: 1 day&#xD;
           (&gt; 38 weeks GA neonate or older) to 17 years. b. Exclusion Criteria i. Patients who have&#xD;
           congenital heart defects. ii. Patient who the medical team feels may require urgent&#xD;
           escalation of non-invasive therapy or imminent intubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           iii. Patients who are on FIO2 &gt; 0.6 at the highest level of flow offered within the&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           iv. Patients who are immunocompromised and/or status post bone marrow transplant v.&#xD;

           Patients with a known airway anomaly, e.g. Pierre-Robin, tracheomalacia. vii. Patients&#xD;
           less than 38 weeks gestational age viii. Patients less than 3 kilograms ix. If the EIT&#xD;
           band/electrodes are not able to be properly positioned on the chest due to size/weight&#xD;
           limitations x. If the medical team feels that the patient is not appropriate to enroll&#xD;
           in the study based on medical, social or emotional concerns&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Description of Study Treatments or Exposures/Predictors Following informed consent,&#xD;
           patients who are ordered to receive HFNC therapy will be randomized to escalating flows&#xD;
           (low to high) or deescalating (high to low) each hour and then returned to their&#xD;
           previously order flow setting. According to age they will be placed on three different&#xD;
           flow settings for 1 hour as shown in table 1 with a nasal cannula outside diameter no&#xD;
           larger than 50% of the inside diameter of the naris. Table 1 was developed based on&#xD;
           three known tidal volumes of 4, 6, and 8 mL/Kg with a 33% inspiratory time and highest&#xD;
           normal respiratory rate. Measurements of SPO2, EIT, TCM CO2, and respiratory rate will&#xD;
           be recorded every 15 minutes. FIO2 will be adjusted to maintain SPO2 90-95%.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Transcutaneous CO2 (TCM) (Sentec) will be placed 30 minutes before randomization in&#xD;
           order to allow for equilibration with the surface of the skin. We will place the TCM on&#xD;
           left upper chest on patients less than 15 Kg and earlobe for those &gt; 15 Kg. The device&#xD;
           is FDA approved and warms the skin to allow for diffusion of CO2 across the membrane of&#xD;
           the skin and sensor. This device will allow us to develop a modified ventilation index.&#xD;
&#xD;
           EIT measurements - EIT measurements will be taken prior to randomization and 1 hour&#xD;
           after each of the three flow range changes. This involves the placement of a 16&#xD;
           electrode band around the patients' chest, just below the nipple line.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Pulse oximetry and co-oximetry - SpO2, S/F ratio (SpO2 to FIO2 ratio) SpHb (non-invasive&#xD;
           HGB), and SpOC (oxygen content) will be monitored continuously for the 3 hour period.&#xD;
           The average SpO2, S/F ratio, and SpOC will be calculated from the streamed data&#xD;
           collected by the Masimo RAD-7 via a lap-top computer. Desaturations will be defined as a&#xD;
           SpO2 &lt; 85% and reported. Excel will be utilized to perform these functions. An FDA&#xD;
           approved disposable SPO2 probe will be applied to the patients' finger, thumb or toe.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Definition of Primary and Secondary Outcomes/Endpoints a. Primary i. Oxygenation 1.&#xD;
           Higher SPO2 on lower FIO2 (S/F ratio) 2. SpOC, and frequency of desaturations ii.&#xD;
           Ventilation 1. Lower respiratory rate 2. Lower TCM CO2 b. Secondary i. Regional&#xD;
           distribution difference measured by EIT 1. Area and upper to lower ratio will be the&#xD;
           primary data analyzed 2. Regional filling of the lung will be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Data Collection Methods, Assessments, Interventions and Schedule (what assessments&#xD;
           performed, how often) Data will be recorded continuously on each of the devices'&#xD;
           (Draeger EIT, Sentec TCM, Masimo SPO2) computer. Data will be downloaded with either a&#xD;
           USB drive or PCMC card and merged into one excel spreadsheet for analysis. Data will be&#xD;
           manually recorded every 15 minutes for the entire 3 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Study Timeline a. See figure three.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E. Adverse Event Criteria and Reporting Procedures Due to the fact that this is a pilot study&#xD;
      the PI will review each major adverse event. The following complications will be monitored&#xD;
      but only major complications will reported to the IRB. Minor events include: bradycardia (10%&#xD;
      below baseline), increase in respiratory rate &gt; 20%, increase in TCpCO2 by 10 mmHg, increase&#xD;
      in FIO2 of &gt; 0.3, hypoventilation (breath hold longer than 15 second) and desaturation&#xD;
      (&lt;88%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Major events that will halt the study and be immediately reported to the IRB are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Desaturation &lt; 80% (continuously monitored by pulse oximetry) for longer than 1 minute.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bradycardia &lt; 60 BPM All major and minor events will be monitored and reported to the PI&#xD;
           by the clinical research coordinator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      F. Data Management Methods Upon entry, each patient will be assigned a number unique and&#xD;
      unlinked from their medical record for the purpose of patient tracking. This number will be&#xD;
      entered into a privately owned BCH, password protected research drive accessible only by BCH&#xD;
      study personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A spreadsheet will be kept at the bedside during the data collection period (3 hours) for&#xD;
      each data point to be entered manually.&#xD;
&#xD;
      G. Quality Control Method Quality of the transfer of data will be ensured by a second&#xD;
      investigator, who will confirm the manual and electronic data. SPSS software will be used to&#xD;
      help analyze the data and ensuring data integrity by establishing alerts for non-filled&#xD;
      fields as well as unexpected or possibly misentered results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H. Data Analysis Plan We will consider that &gt;10% differences in respiratory rate between flow&#xD;
      setting to be considered significant. We will consider a &gt; 20% difference in TCM CO2 and SPO2&#xD;
      to be considered significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EIT data: The lung imaging system is the Dräger EIT Pulmovista 500 (Dräger Medical, Lübeck,&#xD;
      Germany). Sixteen coplanar electrodes will be placed equidistantly around the thorax at the&#xD;
      level of the parasternal sixth intercostal space. The reference electrode will be placed on&#xD;
      the right side of the abdomen near the waistline. Electrodes #1 and #16 are symmetrically&#xD;
      placed to the left and the right of the sternum, respectively, so that electrodes #8 and #9&#xD;
      straddled the spinal column. This configuration leads to transverse images in the&#xD;
      radiological convention, caudal to cranial, similar to a cat scan. Lung image reconstruction&#xD;
      will be done according to the Graz consensus for electrical impedance tomography (GREIT) (15)&#xD;
      using the Electrical Impedance and Diffuse Optical Reconstruction Software (16). In simple&#xD;
      terms, the idea is to observe any shifts in the center of ventilation by assessing the ratio&#xD;
      of the ventral to dorsal impedance changes ( ) during each part of the study. Impedance&#xD;
      changes indicate how open or closed the lung is. This approach has been previously described&#xD;
      in detail by our research group (17).&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Statistical Power and Sample Considerations Power analysis reveals based on repeated&#xD;
      measures of three different flows per patient that 35 patients (7 per age category) are&#xD;
      required for an effect size of 0.2, alpha of .05 and power of 0.8. Differences in mean values&#xD;
      oxygenation (SPO2 and S/F ratio), ventilation (TCM CO2), and EIT (U/L ratio) between each&#xD;
      treatment group will be compared every hour over the three hour testing period following&#xD;
      randomization using ANOVA with Tukey post-hoc test.&#xD;
&#xD;
