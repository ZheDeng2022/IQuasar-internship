      Atrophic vaginitis affects the majority of post-menopausal women. It is characterized by&#xD;
      dryness and inflammation of the vagina, with thinning of the vaginal tissues. Atrophic&#xD;
      vaginitis is caused by the decreased effect of estrogens post menopause. Traditionally, local&#xD;
      estrogens have been used to treat atrophic vaginitis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have shown that there are progesterone receptors in vaginal tissues. The use of&#xD;
      progesterone to treat atrophic vaginitis has not yet been studied. However, its use has been&#xD;
      studied in other populations including as a fertility medication in pregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a significant group of women who cannot use, choose not to use, or do not respond to&#xD;
      estrogenic therapies. The goal of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of vaginal&#xD;
      progesterone in the treatment of urogenital atrophy, compared to placebo. This study is a&#xD;
      randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial. The ultimate goal is to expand the&#xD;
      treatment options for patients with symptoms of vaginal atrophy.&#xD;

      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Atrophic vaginitis is a condition that affects the majority of postmenopausal women. It is&#xD;
      characterized by dryness and inflammation of the vagina, with thinning of the vaginal&#xD;
      tissues. Atrophic vaginitis is caused by the decreased effect of estrogens post menopause.&#xD;
      This condition becomes more significant over time, as systemic levels of estrogen decline.&#xD;
      This is in contrast to vasomotor symptoms of the peri-menopause and early post-menopause,&#xD;
      which generally subside as time passes. Therefore, because of an aging demographic, it is a&#xD;
      condition that will have an ever-growing population requiring its treatment. However, only a&#xD;
      minority of women that suffer from atrophic vaginitis seek medical help. Instead, many women&#xD;
      make difficult lifestyle changes to deal with their symptoms. This may include avoiding&#xD;
      sexual activity to avoid the associated pain with intercourse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vagina has a significant of estrogen receptors. Effects of estrogens on the vagina have&#xD;
      been well studied. Currently, there are numerous estrogenic therapy options, both systemic&#xD;
      and local, to treat symptoms of vaginal atrophy. Recent evidence supports the efficacy of&#xD;
      this population of lower vaginal estrogen doses (10mcg) than previously used (25mcg).&#xD;
      Emerging evidence is demonstrating efficacy for ultra-low doses of estrogen therapies. The&#xD;
      search for such low doses of estrogen therapy suggests an ongoing distrust among both the&#xD;
      public and the scientific community for the acceptability of estrogen therapy. Despite these&#xD;
      lower does, many women are still unable or unwilling to use local estrogen therapy. The&#xD;
      options for such women are limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have shown that there are progesterone receptors in vaginal tissues. The use of&#xD;
      progesterone to treat atrophic vaginitis has not yet been studied. However, its use has been&#xD;
      studied in other populations. Progesterone therapy has long been used to support fertility in&#xD;
      reproductive aged women, with few side effects. Progesterone also has a long history of use&#xD;
      in the menopausal population. It is administered as combined therapy with estrogen, providing&#xD;
      endometrial protection against hyperplasia and malignancy. This addition of a progestin to&#xD;
      systemic estrogen therapy for women with a uterus is the standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a significant group of women who cannot use, choose not to use, or do not respond to&#xD;
      estrogenic therapies. The goal of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of vaginal&#xD;
      progesterone in the treatment of urogenital atrophy, compared to placebo. The ultimate goal&#xD;
      is to expand the treatment options for patients with symptoms of vaginal atrophy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current standard of care for women with vaginal atrophy is treatment with local estrogen.&#xD;
      However, a significant number of women cannot or prefer not to use estrogen therapy because&#xD;
      of potential side effects. The alternative options are few and provide limited symptomatic&#xD;
      relief. The investigators propose vaginal progesterone as an alternative therapeutic option&#xD;
      for the relief of vaginal atrophy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to find and effective alternative therapeutic option to vaginal&#xD;
      estrogen, in the way of vaginal progesterone, for the treatment of vaginal atrophy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Local progesterone will be superior to placebo for patient reported symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Women receiving a course of local progesterone will have superior physician assessment&#xD;
           of vaginal atrophy compared to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Local progesterone will improve vaginal pH and maturation index compared to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted out of Dr. Wolfman's Gynecology and Menopause Clinics at the&#xD;
      Mount Sinai Hospital Ontario Power Generation Building. Women who are post menopausal and&#xD;
      presenting with complaints of vaginal atrophy will be eligible for inclusion in the study.&#xD;
      Women may self identify to participate in the study, in response to recruitment materials&#xD;
      present in the clinical office, or may be identified by their health care professional.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a randomized, double blinded, placebo controlled trial. The participants will be&#xD;
      randomized on a 1:1 ratio to either vaginal progesterone suppository, or an identical&#xD;
      placebo. The dose of the vaginal progesterone suppository is 100mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study medication will be provided by the Australia Research Centre for Health of Women&#xD;
      and Babies, University of Adelaide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be completed by a computer generated system through the Mount Sinai&#xD;
      Pharmacy. Study medications will be shipped directly to the homes of study participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in the study will consist of two clinical visits. The first clinical visit is a&#xD;
      baseline visit. The second visit will occur following twelve weeks of using the study&#xD;
      medication. The visits will be similar in procedures and time involved, as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Symptom questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical breast exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vaginal speculum exam, including a Pap test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serum progesterone level&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cholesterol panel, if not completed within previous year&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Approximately 60 minutes in length&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Symptom questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical breast exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vaginal speculum exam, including a vaginal exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serum progesterone level&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Approximately 60 minutes in length&#xD;
&#xD;
      The symptom questionnaire will ask patients to rate their symptoms of vaginal atrophy. It&#xD;
      will evaluate the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  vaginal dryness&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  vaginal and/or vulvar irritation or itching&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  vaginal pain associated with sexual activity Symptoms will be rated on a scale of 0&#xD;
           through 3, with zero being none, one being mild, two being moderate and three being&#xD;
           severe. Patients will be asked to identify their most bothersome symptom. Patients who&#xD;
           are not sexually active may participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vaginal exam will be performed by the study gynecologist, Dr. Wolfman or the Menopause&#xD;
      fellow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will also have a vaginal speculum exam performed by the staff gynecologist or&#xD;
      fellow. Vaginal swabs will be collected to assess vagina pH and maturation index. pH will be&#xD;
      measured by inserting a pH test strip into the upper third of the vagina and completing the&#xD;
      reading while the strip is damp. A sample slide with vaginal cells will be collected to be&#xD;
      sent to the laboratory in order to measure maturation value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical breast exam will be conducted to rule out any clinically evident breast disease&#xD;
      prior to the study, and following the 12 weeks of study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood work will be collected to assess serum progesterone levels. The investigators&#xD;
      anticipate systemic absorption to be low. A serum cholesterol panel will also be collected to&#xD;
      ensure the patient has normal baseline values if there is not a recent (within one year)&#xD;
      result available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events will also be recorded outcomes. These include headaches, vaginal discharge,&#xD;
      vulvo-vaginal mycotic infection (either diagnosed or self-treated), increased vulvo-vaginal&#xD;
      pruritis, vaginal bleeding and other. On the Consent Form, there is contact information for&#xD;
      patients so they are able to reach study personnel, should they have any questions or&#xD;
      concerns, or need to report adverse events. A 24 hour emergency number is also available to&#xD;
      patients in the study, should they need to contact study personnel at any time. Adverse&#xD;
      events will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis, as they occur. A record will be made of&#xD;
      any and all adverse events, by the study investigators. For any serious adverse events, the&#xD;
      patients will be advised to immediately study the study medication. Unblinding of the staff&#xD;
      and/or study participants will occur when this is deemed necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All relevant clinical outcomes will be evaluated before therapy initiation, at the baseline&#xD;
      visit, and following 12 weeks of therapy. Improvement in symptoms between the two time&#xD;
      periods will be evaluated.&#xD;
