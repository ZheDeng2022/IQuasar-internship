      The CAPRISA 014 trial aims to assess the safety and acceptability of the long-acting (LA)&#xD;
      injectable antiretroviral agent, cabotegravir LA (GSK1265744), in HIV uninfected women in&#xD;
      KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The CAPRISA 014 trial is designed to establish the safety and acceptability of cabotegravir&#xD;
      LA in sexually active, at-risk HIV-uninfected women. A total of 632 HIV uninfected women (18&#xD;
      to 30 years) from two sites in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa will be enrolled. The trial will&#xD;
      be approximately 24 months, with an additional 12 months post-trial safety observation. The&#xD;
      study is divided into three periods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Period 1 - Clinical trial oral lead-in (up to 34 days) - Consenting participants will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive daily oral cabotegravir (30mg tablets) or daily oral placebo for&#xD;
      approximately 30 days, to assess safety and tolerability prior to exposure to the LA&#xD;
      injectable formulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Period 2 - Clinical trial follow-up with injectable (approximately 48-96 weeks) -&#xD;
      Participants who have successfully completed Period 1 will receive intra-muscular (IM)&#xD;
      gluteal injections of cabotegravir LA (800 mg, administered as two 400 mg injections) or&#xD;
      placebo every 12 weeks. The end of Period 2 marks the completion of clinical trial follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Period 3 - Post-trial safety follow-up off-product (approximately 12 months) - During this&#xD;
      post-trial safety observation period, participants will be followed up (off product) for&#xD;
      approximately 12 months after completion of period 2.&#xD;
