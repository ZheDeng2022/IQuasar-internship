      INTRODUCTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biliary obstruction is the most relevant factor for survival and quality of life in patients&#xD;
      suffering from primary bile duct malignancies or pancreatic head carcinoma. Due to their&#xD;
      insidious course, these cancers are often diagnosed at an advanced stage. Thus, therapy is&#xD;
      frequently restricted to palliative management. Within this setting, the prevention/treatment&#xD;
      of biliary complications such as jaundice, cholangitis, or sepsis is one of the key&#xD;
      therapeutic factors to extend survival and maintain quality of life (1-3). Endoscopic&#xD;
      stenting of the biliary tract is now generally accepted as the primary approach to&#xD;
      reestablish sufficient biliary drainage, provided approximately 50% of the liver parenchyma&#xD;
      is drained (4). As the tumor grows, unfortunately, it often occurs that jaundice reappears&#xD;
      despite primary stenting. Most oftenly this relates to unbridled tumor expansion leading to&#xD;
      either stent-dysfunction by tumor ingrowth (through the mesh in case of metallic stenting of&#xD;
      or via clogging of plastic stents) or either to extension in more proximal bile&#xD;
      ducts/branches shutting of sufficient/adequate biliary drainage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the context of incurable disease, a minimally-invasive strategy that could reduce the&#xD;
      tumor burden in addition to stenting might be considered beneficial in terms of longer&#xD;
      sustained bile duct drainage, and as such improve quality of life, more efficiently&#xD;
      administered and better tolerated courses chemotherapy and delayed disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An example of such a potential minimal invasive strategy is RadioFrequency Ablation (RFA). It&#xD;
      involves a modified electrocautery technique that has emerged among the many choices for&#xD;
      local, minimally invasive tissue ablation. It has proven effective, versatile, and relatively&#xD;
      inexpensive. RFA has been used for years in the treatment of cardiac dysrhythmias from&#xD;
      aberrant conduction pathways, osteoid osteoma, prostate hypertrophy, and chronic pain (5-8).&#xD;
      Recent clinical applications include tumor ablation in the liver (9-11), kidney (12,13)&#xD;
      adrenal gland (14,15), bone (16), lung (17), and breast (18) as well as soft tissue debulking&#xD;
      and pain palliation (19).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the context of gastro-intestinal endoscopy, RFA has taken its place in the reduction of&#xD;
      neoplastic progression of Barrett esophagus over 3 years of follow-up (20).&#xD;
&#xD;
      With regard to biliopancreatic endoscopy and oncology in particular, this approach has only&#xD;
      recently been introduced. A primary experience using an alternative endoscopically applicable&#xD;
      RFA-system for bile duct lesions, has shown to be feasible and safe ex vivo in resected fresh&#xD;
      pig livers and in an open-label pilot study involving 22 patients with malignant biliary&#xD;
      obstruction (21,22). Similar results have been obtained in animal testing for the ELRA-system&#xD;
      (StarMed, Taewoong Medical, Seoul, Korea).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presumed theoretical advantage of the current system (ELRA system, StarMed, Taewoong&#xD;
      Medical, Seoul, Korea) is the capacity to better control the locally applied temperature at&#xD;
      all times and to maintain temperature continuous, as such preventing tissue adjacent to an&#xD;
      active tip from carbonization during the procedure. Additionally the 4-ring appliance of&#xD;
      thermal ablation allows a better thermal spreading and therefore appliance of ablation&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY OBJECTIVE &amp; DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project involves a single center investigator-driven prospective non-randomized&#xD;
      non-controlled trial evaluating feasibility, safety and efficacy of thermal ablation of&#xD;
      biliary obstructive malignancies by means of the ELRA RF during ERCP with primary intent to&#xD;
      obtain palliative biliary drainage via stenting .&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY METHODOLOGY : POPULATION &amp; INTERVENTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELIGIBLE PATIENT POPULATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients with an inoperable biliopancreatic tumor with obstructive jaundice and therefore&#xD;
      in need of biliary drainage via ERCP, eligible and consenting for inclusion (cfr infra), will&#xD;
      be considered for entry in the study. This is a non-randomized non-controlled&#xD;
      investigator-driven trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ENDOSCOPIC INTERVENTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      All procedures will be performed under general anesthesia, according to standard good&#xD;
      clinical practice. After performing an endoscopic sphincterotomy with/without balloon&#xD;
      dilatation of the stenosis (conventional approach) in preparation of stenting, a RFA catheter&#xD;
      (ELRA, Taewoong, Seoul, Korea), suitable for endoscopic delivery into the biliary tree over a&#xD;
      0.035-inch guide wire, will be advanced up to the level of the malignant stenosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot;end of follow-up&quot; is defined as the end of the follow-up period (designated at 3 months&#xD;
      after index procedure) or failure of treatment or death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcome parameters will be compared to those of a historically matched control group&#xD;
      (i.e. stented without RFA).&#xD;
