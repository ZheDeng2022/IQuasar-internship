  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intravenous (IV) tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) administration has been shown to be safe&#xD;
      and effective for treatment of AIS within 3 hours of symptom onset, and newer evidence has&#xD;
      shown potential benefit out to 4.5 hours. Mechanical thrombectomy for AIS patients has been&#xD;
      shown in clinical trials to be safe up to 8 hours after symptom onset. Recent trials&#xD;
      utilizing advanced imaging to identify patients with large vessel occlusions amenable to&#xD;
      intra-arterial thrombectomy (IAT) have shown superiority endovascular therapy over medical&#xD;
      therapy to result in improved patient functional outcomes. Pilot data utilizing the ADAPT&#xD;
      approach has shown superior technical results with similar functional outcomes while lowering&#xD;
      procedure time and device costs versus traditional stent retriever as a first line therapy&#xD;
      approaches&#xD;

      This is a prospective, randomized trial comparing mechanical thrombectomy with the ADAPT&#xD;
      approach to stent retrievers in patients presenting with AIS within 6 hours of symptom onset.&#xD;
      Any cleared mechanical stent retriever (SR) or aspiration catheter device that is in common&#xD;
      use in the operator's region of practice is approved for use. Prior to releasing any sites to&#xD;
      enroll patients, we will collect the following information on the most recent 20 acute&#xD;
      ischemic stroke cases, at least five of which must have used direct aspiration as a first&#xD;
      approach, and at least five of which must have used stent retrievers as a first approach. It&#xD;
      is permissible to go back in time farther than the most recent 20 cases to fulfill either or&#xD;
      both of these requirements. There is no requirement for the remaining 10 cases. The&#xD;
      datapoints to be collected include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gender&#xD;
&#xD;

           criteria, consent to participate, and who are randomized will be considered enrolled.&#xD;
           Treatment arm will be randomly assigned by a central web-based system in a 1:1 manner to&#xD;
           treatment with either ADAPT or SR thrombectomy. Data on each patient will be collected&#xD;
           at the time of enrollment and treatment, and at subsequent follow-up visits.&#xD;

    <description>The primary objective is to show that AIS patients, with appropriate image selection, treated with ADAPT mechanical thrombectomy approach within 6 hours of symptom onset do not have inferior clinical outcomes to those treated with a first-line stent retriever approach with 90-day global disability assessed via the modified Rankin Scale score (mRS), analyzed using success criteria as mRS 0 to 2.</description>

    <description>If the patient is randomized to mechanical thrombectomy, the groin puncture to initiate the procedure should occur within 1 hour of the clinical imaging used to determine trial candidacy. An introducer sheath will be placed in the femoral artery. Diagnostic angiography is initially performed via the transfemoral approach with catheterization of the carotid artery appropriate to the patient's presenting symptoms. Once thrombus in the appropriate vessel is identified, the thrombectomy procedure will be initiated.</description>
