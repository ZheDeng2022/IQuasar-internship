  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adult patients with suspected or confirmed idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (IIM) will be&#xD;
      recruited. Patients will be approached, consented, have baseline demographics, diagnostics&#xD;
      and disease activity measures recorded, and blood taken. The collection of data and&#xD;
      biological material will mirror usual clinical practice as far as possible. Subjects will&#xD;
      ideally attend further visits at 3, 6 and 12 months to have bloods taken, outcome measures&#xD;
      recorded and questionnaires completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, blood, muscle biopsies and imaging undertaken as part of usual care will also be&#xD;
      collected for research purposes to measure a number of biomarkers for the assessment of&#xD;
      diagnostic accuracy and clinical utility evaluation. As per usual practice, a muscle biopsy&#xD;
      will be performed at baseline, and a further biopsy offered at 6 months to assess treatment&#xD;
      response. A magnetic resonance (MR) muscle protocol will also be performed as per usual&#xD;
      clinical practice, and a gadolinium-enhanced MR heart scan offered. Both these scans will be&#xD;
      repeated at 6 months. An existing electronic database entry system will be used for data&#xD;
      entry and capture on an anonymised basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will thus be based around diagnostic evaluations and outcome measures to improve&#xD;
      quality of care in IIM.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The bioresource from this protocol, ethics application and future funding will comprise the&#xD;
      following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) UKMYONET cross-sectional study ii) MYOPROSP inception cohort study iii) MYOACT novel&#xD;
      therapies registry iv) UK neuromuscular biobank&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint The primary study endpoint will be sensitivity to change of the biomarkers&#xD;
      of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will include but not limited to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Response to treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Drug reductions and cessations due to treatment failure, adverse events and clinical&#xD;
           remission&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Differentiation of myositis subgroups using newer imaging modalities&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sensitivity of biomarkers to diagnose extramuscular manifestations (including myocardial&#xD;
           and pulmonary lung disease) and predict their severity and clinical course&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identification of novel genetic variants associated with IIM and subtypes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cost economic analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Validations of definition of improvement criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cases will be adults &gt;18 years, with a number of different IIM clinical phenotypes&#xD;
      encountered in clinically practice. It is vitally important that patients with suspected, but&#xD;
      not confirmed, IIM are also included so that the natural history and subsequent final&#xD;
      diagnoses can be tracked. Subsequent investigations will often confirm a diagnosis that was&#xD;
      not confirmed at initial presentation. Patients who do have confirmed PM/DM will have IIM&#xD;
      according to the Bohan and Peter criteria, which remains the internationally accepted&#xD;
      criteria for inclusion into clinical trials. Disease duration from onset of initial symptoms&#xD;
      would ideally be less than one year to enrich the cohort with patients of high disease&#xD;
      activity and minimal established disease-related damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with suspected &quot;possible&quot; polymyositis (PM)/dermatomyositis (DM), where a diagnosis&#xD;
      of IIM is suspected but not confirmed probable/definite by the Bohan and Peter criteria, will&#xD;
      also be eligible. Patients with myositis as their primary condition and also fulfilling&#xD;
      criteria for an associated connective tissue disease, including but not limited to, systemic&#xD;
      sclerosis, Sjogren's, SLE, rheumatoid arthritis, will also be allowed for inclusion into the&#xD;
      study. Patients will also be eligible if they present with ILD/Raynaud's or other CTD&#xD;
      features in association with a myositis specific antibody other than an anti-synthetase and&#xD;
      no other obvious IIM-diagnostic features. Patients with IBM will also be accepted on to the&#xD;
      study, meeting the revised MRC Neuromuscular criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will also be accepted on to the study if they possess amyopathic or hypomyopathic&#xD;
      DM, as per the Sontheimer criteria, which states that &quot;amyopathic DM is a subset of DM&#xD;
      characterized by biopsy-confirmed hallmark cutaneous manifestations of classic DM occurring&#xD;
      for 6 months or longer with no clinical evidence of proximal muscle weakness and no serum&#xD;
      muscle enzyme abnormalities. If more extensive muscle testing is carried out, the results&#xD;
      should be within normal limits&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial approach Patients will be sent a letter from their consultants. The letter will give&#xD;
      a brief introduction to the proposed study and a patient information sheet will be included.&#xD;
      A unique identifier would be assigned to each potential new recruit. Potential participants&#xD;
      will be given a full explanation of the study and provided with a patient information sheet&#xD;
      and consent form to sign, following the opportunity to ask any questions. If having been&#xD;
      allowed sufficient time to consider their decision, and they want to participate, informed&#xD;
      consent will then be sought. The samples will be anonymised, processed, and sent to The&#xD;
      University of Manchester for storage and analysis. No treatment will be withheld for the&#xD;
      purposes of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection i) UKMYONET cross-sectional study Baseline core data encompassing the&#xD;
      clinical information outlined in UKMYONET will be collected. Blood for sera and plasma will&#xD;
      also be collected. Retrospective data collection will also be allowed to interrogate how&#xD;
      baseline characteristics may influence outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii) MYOPROSP inception cohort study Baseline core data encompassing the clinical information&#xD;
      outlined in UKMYONET will be collected, and extended data on medication use and disease&#xD;
      activity. As genetic material (DNA) does not change with time, it would only be necessary to&#xD;
      obtain this at one time-point (0 months); however, epigenetic, psychological, clinical and&#xD;
      serological factors will alter over the course of the treatment, therefore sequential samples&#xD;
      will be taken at 3, 6 and 12 month time points for comparison. Whilst being taken as part of&#xD;
      routine clinical practice, patients can also consent to have part of their muscle biopsy,&#xD;
      used for research purposes, as well as a follow-up biopsy. If other tissues are being taken&#xD;
      as part of routine clinical practice, the patient can also be consented for their use as part&#xD;
      of research studies. Patients may also be approached for further clinical data collection at&#xD;
      yearly intervals up to 5 years after inception.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii) MYOACT novel therapies registry Baseline core data encompassing the clinical information&#xD;
      outlined in UKMYONET will be collected, and extended data on medication use and disease&#xD;
      activity. Patients will also be given the option to partake in MYOPROSP for blood collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iv) UK neuromuscular biobank Blood/tissue related to the underlying disease process will be&#xD;
      collected if being taken for clinical purposes. Blood samples will be used to extracted DNA,&#xD;
      RNA, PBMC (peripheral blood mononuclear cells), serum and plasma samples which will also be&#xD;
      stored for use in future studies. Additionally, patients will be asked for their permission&#xD;
      to use their anonymised clinical and demographic details in any future research projects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood sampling Patients consenting to take part in the study will be asked to provide blood&#xD;
      samples as outlined above at baseline, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months. Normally, it is&#xD;
      routine clinical practice to assess patients at these time points. These blood tests will be&#xD;
      taken in addition to routine tests required during these assessments. Hence, although an&#xD;
      additional blood sample will be taken, no additional venepuncture will be required thus&#xD;
      minimising any inconvenience for the patient. In exceptional circumstances, it may be&#xD;
      required that a blood sample is taken at an extra visit if clinic/nurse time is not available&#xD;
      for this routine sampling. Standard laboratory assays or ELISA will be used for measuring&#xD;
      serum enzyme, cytokine and antibody levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient questionnaires Clinical data will be attained regarding their level of disability&#xD;
      (Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire) and health outcome (EQ-5D-5L). When patients&#xD;
      attend for review at each of the time points (3/6/12 months), they will be asked to complete&#xD;
      these questionnaires. If the diagnosis is DM, patients will be asked to fill in the&#xD;
      dermatology life quality index (DLQI) questionnaire, and if IBM, the Inclusion Body Myositis&#xD;
      Functional Related Scale (IBM-FRS). The blood samples and questionnaires will already be&#xD;
      labelled with a unique identifier and returned to the Centre for Musculoskeletal Research,&#xD;
      The University of Manchester, using a pre-paid, pre-addressed blood box for the blood and a&#xD;
      separate pre-paid stamped addressed envelope for the documentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Core dataset&#xD;
&#xD;
      The core dataset will comprise the UKMYONET basic dataset questionnaire and bloods for serum&#xD;
      and plasma. Consent will also allow for further data collection as per the MYOPROSP study if&#xD;
      the patient is under regular follow up. The International Myositis Assessment and Clinical&#xD;
      Studies (IMACS) Group have agreed core-set measures to assess myositis disease activity,&#xD;
      including assessment of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMACS core measures of disease activity&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Physician/patient global activity assessment by visual analogue scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. IMACS core measures of disease activity&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Physical function&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Muscle enzymes&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Extraskeletal muscle disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Physical impairment measured with the Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
      Muscle tissue is the primary organ affected in myositis, but other organs may also be&#xD;
      involved, hence the requirement to capture extraskeletal disease activity using the Myositis&#xD;
      Intention to Treat Index (MITAX) and the Myositis Activity Assessment by Visual Analogue&#xD;
      Scales (MYOACT). The Myositis Damage Index (MDI) assesses extent and severity of damage.&#xD;
      MITAX, MYOACT and MDI are all physician-initiated questionnaires. Further optional&#xD;
      information can also be collected if performed as part of a routine clinical assessment, eg&#xD;
      information on endurance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Data As well as the information in the Core dataset, data will be captured at&#xD;
      baseline including demographics, clinical disease classification, data detailing confirmation&#xD;
      of diagnosis (including muscle biopsy, electromyography, autoantibody status, MR findings)&#xD;
      co-morbidities and therapies. Changes in therapy will be captured at subsequent visits along&#xD;
      with IMACS core measures. For IBM, additional monitoring will be performed including but not&#xD;
      limited to IBM functional related scale, 6 minute walk test, timed up and go, grip strength.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MR imaging As a sub-study, patients will be given the option of having MR imaging of the&#xD;
      femur to image the thigh musculature, and gadolinium-enhanced MR imaging of the heart at&#xD;
      months 0 and 6. It is normal clinical practice to perform an MR of the femur at baseline and&#xD;
      follow-up, and would be considered best practice to MR image the heart. In patients where&#xD;
      gadolinium contrast would be deemed high-risk (renal impairment, history of previous contrast&#xD;
      reactions), this would not be offered. A protocol will be developed in conjunction with&#xD;
      musculoskeletal radiology colleagues to standardise the methods used for MR imaging in the&#xD;
      different participating centres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Muscle biopsy At diagnosis, a muscle biopsy is routinely performed under local anaesthetic in&#xD;
      a non-invasive fashion. Several samples are usually taken in one pass, and one sample will&#xD;
      stored in a PAXgene tube for RNA expression studies. The remainder of the samples will be&#xD;
      processed and analysed in the local clinical histopathological departments. Muscle biopsy&#xD;
      specimens will be snap-frozen in isopentane using liquid nitrogen and stored at -80C.&#xD;
      Protocols for muscle tissue mounting, sectioning and storage that have already been tested&#xD;
      and optimised as part of the UK juvenile dermatomyositis research study will be used. A&#xD;
      further biopsy will be planned and offered at 6 months post-recruitment into the study.&#xD;
      Although this is not routine clinical practice, an important clinical question needs to be&#xD;
      addressed about the clinical utility of repeat biopsy and whether it may quantify change in&#xD;
      disease activity and thus allow for accurate decision-making about treatment&#xD;
      reduction/escalation.&#xD;
