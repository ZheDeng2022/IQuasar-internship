    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1 study of sildenafil in combination with regorafenib in patients with&#xD;
      progressive advanced solid tumors. A modified 3+3 dose escalation design will be conducted&#xD;
      for the dose escalation of the treatment combination: additional patients will be enrolled at&#xD;
      the MTD until a total of 12 patients have been treated at the MTD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a single-arm, open-label, phase 1 trial to determine the RP2D of the&#xD;
      combination of regorafenib and sildenafil. Both study medications will be taken orally on&#xD;
      days 1-21 of each 28-day cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a modified 3+3 dose escalation design, 3-6 patients with an advanced solid tumor will&#xD;
      be enrolled at each dose level. Additional patients will be enrolled at the MTD until a total&#xD;
      of 12 patients have been treated at the MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will have received available standard treatments. Patients with solid&#xD;
      tumors for which regorafenib would be considered a standard treatment are eligible as long as&#xD;
      regorafenib has not been previously administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be collected for correlative studies including PK, PD, and CTCs. Tumor&#xD;
      samples archived from a previous biopsy or surgery will also be collected for correlative&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
