  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment outcome with ABVD in elderly patients remains inferior to adults. Moreover,&#xD;
      Bleomycin-induced lung toxicity in the elderly has been reported as high as 46%. For these&#xD;
      reasons, questions arise whether ABVD could be still considered the standard treatment in HL&#xD;
      patients aged &gt; than 60. Regimens containing other alkylators such as CHOP proved even&#xD;
      superior to ABVD, with a 3-y PFS of 67%. Frontline treatment of advanced-stage HL with&#xD;
      Brentuximab Vedotin (BV) in association with AVD (Doxorubicin, Vinblastine, Dacarbazine)&#xD;
      proved very active in a pioneer study, reporting the preliminary results of a phase 1&#xD;
      multicentre trial, in which the percentage of patients achieving CR was as high as 92%. For&#xD;
      all these reason the investigators decided to test the association of an alkylator with an&#xD;
      innovative mechanism of action and a very safe toxicity profile in the elderly such as&#xD;
      Bendamustine (Be) with BV in untreated elderly HL patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of BV and Be, investigated in this study, might represent an innovative&#xD;
      treatment alternative for HL patients older than 60 years of age, especially for those of&#xD;
      them in whom ABVD chemotherapy, the current standard front-line treatment, is not suitable.&#xD;
      However, even when ABVD is given as upfront treatment for elderly HL patients, it is&#xD;
      associated with substantial dose reduction, treatment delay, toxicity, and treatment-related&#xD;
      mortality, with treatment outcomes remaining much inferior to those obtained in younger&#xD;
      patients. This drug association is expected to be safe, well-tolerated and to demonstrate&#xD;
      higher efficiency compared with ABVD. In this setting, it is expected that this therapy could&#xD;
      be offered to the large majority of elderly patients with a full treatment completion reached&#xD;
      in up to 80% of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the aim of this study will be to assess safety and efficacy of the above association.&#xD;
