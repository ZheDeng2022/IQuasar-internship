    <textblock>
      This is an open label pilot study of combining BV in a licensed indication with imatinib in&#xD;
      patients with ALCL. It is intended as a &quot;window of opportunity&quot; trial in which the study&#xD;
      drugs will be given as an initial substitute for conventional chemotherapy with the intention&#xD;
      to achieve a remission enabling the patients to proceed to autologous or allogeneic stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation, if eligible.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be included in this trial if they have relapsed or refractory ALK+ ALCL after&#xD;
      at least one line of conventional chemotherapy or if they are ineligible for conventional&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imatinib will be given continuously starting from day 1 of the first cycle at an oral dose of&#xD;
      100mg daily. The dose will be increased to 200mg daily starting from day 1 of the second&#xD;
      cycle if no DLT occurs during the first cycle. BV will be given 3 weekly starting on day 1 at&#xD;
      a dose of 1.8 mg/kg body weight. In the absence of a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) i.e.&#xD;
      haematological toxicity ≥ grade 2, non- haematological toxicity ≥ grade 3, after 3 weeks of&#xD;
      therapy, and in the presence of a clinical response (CR or PR) after cycle 1, the BV dose&#xD;
      will continue every 3 weeks for 48 weeks. Dose modifications and stopping rules will be&#xD;
      introduced as described in chapter 6. In case of progression at any time during the study the&#xD;
      patient will go off trial and receive salvage treatment.&#xD;
