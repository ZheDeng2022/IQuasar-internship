      achieved, the 5-year survival rate is still low because of tumor recurrence. It's reported&#xD;

      (microscopic negative margin) resection patients with advanced stages (T3 or N1), the value&#xD;
      of adjuvant radiation is still in debate. It's warranted to explore the role of adjuvant&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest tumor types of the alimentary system. Despite of&#xD;
      the dramatic progress of diagnostic methods and surgical technics, the overall 5-year&#xD;
      survival is still around 5%. Resection is the only curable method to treat pancreatic cancer,&#xD;
      although only a small proportion of patients are eligible for operation. However, even if&#xD;
      radical resection is achieved, the 5-year survival rate is only 15-20%. The main cause of&#xD;
      death is tumor recurrence, which is as high as 50-70% in 3 years after operation. By now, it&#xD;
      is widely accepted that pancreatic cancer is a systemic disease. Systemic treatments are&#xD;
      recommended in neoadjuvant and adjuvant manners. It's reported adjuvant radiation can prolong&#xD;
      survival and improve quality of life after surgery, especially for patients who undergo a R1&#xD;
      (microscopic positive margin) and R2 (macroscopic positive margin) resection. For R0&#xD;
      (microscopic negative margin) resection patients with advanced stages (T3 or N1), the value&#xD;
      of adjuvant radiation is still in debate. Some argues adjuvant radiation after radical&#xD;
      resection makes no effect on preventing local recurrence and metastasis but may impair&#xD;
      patients' quality of life and overall survival. On the contrary, some other researchers draw&#xD;
      the conclusion that adjuvant radiation may facilitate the local control of tumor recurrence&#xD;
      in small cohorts. It's warranted to explore the role of adjuvant radiation for patients after&#xD;
      radical resection of pancreatic cancer with advanced stages (T3 or N1) in large, prospective,&#xD;
      and randomized cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditionally, radiation may take more than one month to deliver and the dosage is restricted&#xD;
      to prevent damage to surrounding tissues. The size effects and duration impair patients'&#xD;
      compliance. Recently, the application of Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) makes&#xD;
      radiation less harmful and more flexible. The advantages of SBRT are higher dosage of&#xD;
      radiation, less damage to surrounding organs, and significant reduce of duration. To our&#xD;
      knowledge, there is no big randomized clinical trial to evaluate the value of SBRT for&#xD;
      patients after radical resection of pancreatic cancer with advanced stages (T3 or N1). It is&#xD;
      hoped that adjuvant SBRT may benefit post-operative patients with advanced stages and one day&#xD;
      adjuvant SBRT combined with chemotherapy become the standard of care for pancreatic cancer&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
