    <textblock>
      This is a case-control study embedded in a surveillance system to determine the effectiveness&#xD;
      of antenatal maternal influenza vaccination against laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated&#xD;
      hospitalised illness in infants &lt;6 months of age.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study design Investigators will conduct a vaccination campaign amongst pregnant women in&#xD;
      different areas of South Africa and monitor the effectiveness of the programme. Investigators&#xD;
      will then use an unmatched case-control study design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vaccination campaigns will be conducted in clinics with active promotion of influenza&#xD;
      vaccination. Posters will be placed in clinics recommending influenza vaccination for&#xD;
      pregnant women and health education material will be provided. Vaccines will be administered&#xD;
      by clinic staff through routine services as vaccination is the recommended standard of care.&#xD;
      Dedicated study staff (research assistants) will be placed in each clinic offering&#xD;
      vaccination. These staff will assist clinic staff with management of influenza vaccine&#xD;
      supplies and documentation of influenza vaccination status in patient records. Vaccination&#xD;
      status will be documented in the mother's antenatal records. Investigators will visit all the&#xD;
      facilities in the area serving the surveillance hospital and conduct staff training in the&#xD;
      facilities where babies are delivered to enter maternal influenza immunization status on the&#xD;
      child's vaccination card at the time of administration of the birth dose of polio vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identification and enrolment of cases and controls for the estimation of VE against&#xD;
      laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated hospitalised illness in infants&lt;6 months of age&#xD;
      overall and by HIV status Cases and controls will be identified through active sentinel&#xD;
      surveillance for hospitalised medical illness of any diagnosis amongst children aged &lt;6&#xD;
      months. Hospitals where surveillance will be conducted will be large hospitals serving the&#xD;
      communities in which the antenatal TIV campaign will be conducted. Investigators will conduct&#xD;
      ongoing active surveillance with consecutive patient selection until the required sample size&#xD;
      is reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identification and enrolment of cases for monitoring adverse events Dedicated study staff&#xD;
      will conduct an information session with women selected for enrolment. These women will be&#xD;
      asked for written informed consent prior to participation and non-participation will not&#xD;
      affect a woman's eligibility to receive vaccine. Following vaccination administered by the&#xD;
      nurse, as per the Department of Health schedule, demographic information, medical history,&#xD;
      obstetric history and contact details will be collected from each participant by structured&#xD;
      interview. Immediate reactions to the vaccine will be recorded at the time of interview. A&#xD;
      separate aide de memoire diary will then be given to each participant. This diary will assist&#xD;
      the women to record symptoms experienced in the seven days following vaccination. The&#xD;
      symptoms listed will be based on standard collection tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection Hospitalised children &lt;6 months For hospitalised children &lt;6 months of age,&#xD;
      epidemiologic data will be collected from a parent or caregiver interview, if possible, as&#xD;
      well as review of medical and vaccination records of mother (antenatal cards, maternal&#xD;
      in-patient cards and antenatal clinic registers) and baby (Road-to-Health cards and clinic&#xD;
      registers). Information gathered will include: demographics of mother and baby (age, sex,&#xD;
      race), medical history of baby (premature birth, congenital illnesses such congenital heart&#xD;
      or lung disease, immunosuppressive or other chronic illness), recent infections, recent&#xD;
      antimicrobial use, household characteristics (residence type and number of rooms, number of&#xD;
      persons and their ages, questions related to socioeconomic status, exposure to tobacco smoke&#xD;
      and indoor air pollution), child-care centre attendance, breast feeding and vaccination&#xD;
      history. It will also request educational level of the parent or guardian and if adults or&#xD;
      other children in the household had received pneumococcal or influenza vaccines. Information&#xD;
      on HIV status will include whether the mother was tested for HIV during pregnancy and her HIV&#xD;
      status if tested, whether the patient has been previously tested for HIV and results of such&#xD;
      tests, history of underlying illness and previous HIV-associated diagnosis. Nutritional&#xD;
      status of the child will be evaluated measuring weight (in kilograms) and length (in&#xD;
      centimetres) at the time of admission. If the parent or guardian has a written vaccination&#xD;
      record for the case or control child, names, batch numbers and dates of vaccines will be&#xD;
      recorded (see determination of vaccination status below). For issues that may change with&#xD;
      time (e.g. exposure to cigarette smoke, breastfeeding, day-care attendance), the questions&#xD;
      will focus on the 4 weeks (as in 30 or 31 days) before illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse birth outcomes For the effectiveness against adverse birth outcomes (prematurity, LBW&#xD;
      and SGA) epidemiologic data will primarily be collected from birth records and maternal&#xD;
      antenatal records. Information gathered will include: demographics of mother and baby (age&#xD;
      (of mother), sex, race), household characteristics (residence type and number of rooms,&#xD;
      number of persons and their ages, questions related to socioeconomic status. It will also&#xD;
      request educational level of the parent or guardian. Information on HIV status will include&#xD;
      whether the mother was tested for HIV during pregnancy and her HIV status if tested. The&#xD;
      baby's birthweight and gestational age will be evaluated from delivery and antenatal records.&#xD;
      Birthweight (in kilograms) and length (in centimetres) will be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hospitalised pregnant women and postpartum women, â‰¥18 years Epidemiologic, clinical&#xD;
      presentation, laboratory data as well as information on hospital course will be collected&#xD;
      from enrolled patients. A case investigation form will be completed by structured interview.&#xD;
      Information gathered will include: demographics (age, sex, race), presenting symptoms,&#xD;
      medical history (lung disease, immunosuppressive or other chronic illness including cardiac&#xD;
      diseases, chronic renal diseases, diabetes mellitus and similar metabolic disorders),&#xD;
      previous hospital admissions, recent infections, recent antimicrobial use, household&#xD;
      characteristics (residence type and number of rooms, number of persons and their ages,&#xD;
      questions related to socioeconomic status, exposure to tobacco smoke and indoor air&#xD;
      pollution) and data on current and previous influenza vaccination. Information on HIV status&#xD;
      will include current HIV status and whether the patient has been previously tested for HIV&#xD;
      and results of such tests, previous HIV-associated diagnosis, HIV staging. Obesity evaluated&#xD;
      measuring weight (in kilograms) and length (in centimetres) at the time of admission. Medical&#xD;
      records will be reviewed for inpatient management (antimicrobial use, influenza antiviral&#xD;
      therapy and results of investigations conducted) and outcome (admission to ICU, discharged or&#xD;
      died).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring adverse events The diary will be taken home by the participant. Telephone contact&#xD;
      will be made with the participant by a study staff member on day eight (or day 7, 9 or 10 if&#xD;
      day 8 falls over a weekend) and the contents of the diary will be recovered telephonically.&#xD;
      If the study staff are not able to contact the participant on the first attempt, three&#xD;
      further documented attempts will be made to contact the patient. Participants will also be&#xD;
      request to return their diaries at their next clinic visit. Participating women will be asked&#xD;
      to contact the study team if she is hospitalized for any reason in the seven days&#xD;
      post-vaccination. A member of the study team will visit the woman in hospital and, using a&#xD;
      predesigned form, collect data on the reason for hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Logs recording the enrolled patients with their contact details will be kept at each site.&#xD;
      Completed data collection forms will be returned to the data centre at NICD for data capture&#xD;
      and storage.&#xD;

        The study will be conducted in Gauteng Province and Western Cape Province in South Africa.&#xD;
        Both are urban areas with good access to hospital care for mothers and infants. Babies born&#xD;
        to women who were eligible to receive influenza vaccination during pregnancy (i.e. pregnant&#xD;
        from April onwards but actual date will be determined based on actual campaign dates and&#xD;
        resident in the area where vaccination was offered) will be the study population.&#xD;
        Investigators will conduct surveillance for hospitalisations amongst infants &lt;6 months of&#xD;
        age. Investigators will conduct surveillance for adverse birth outcomes at identified&#xD;
        hospitals. Investigators will conduct surveillance for LRTI hospitalisations among pregnant&#xD;
        and postpartum women.&#xD;

&#xD;
               5. Consent to inclusion in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        Study enrolment will occur as follows. Study nurses will review all hospital admissions&#xD;
        (paediatric medical and sleep over wards) to study hospitals each day to identify any&#xD;
        children meeting study case definitions. Parents or guardians of eligible patients will be&#xD;
        approached for enrolment into the case-control study. Parents or guardians will be asked if&#xD;
        study staff can collect a nasopharyngeal aspirate specimen from the child. In addition,&#xD;
        they will be asked to participate in an interview consisting of a list of standardised&#xD;
        questions. Additional information will be obtained from hospital records. If not already&#xD;
        tested for HIV by the ward doctors, HIV testing with pre- and post-test counselling will be&#xD;
        offered to children and mothers to determine child's HIV and HIV-exposure status.&#xD;
