  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an exploratory study, which allows analysis of multiple immune parameters derived&#xD;
      from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with relapsing remitting&#xD;
      multiple sclerosis before and during immune-modulatory treatment with dimethyl fumarate in&#xD;
      comparison to PBMCs from healthy subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the trial is to shed more light on the mechanisms of action of dimethyl&#xD;
      fumarate in patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis. More specifically the&#xD;
      influence of dimethyl fumarate on peripheral immune cells will be addressed to evaluate&#xD;
      changes in cytokine production by the distinct T cell subsets and the differentiation&#xD;
      capacity of naïve T cells. Furthermore, the impact of dimethyl fumarate treatment on the&#xD;
      migratory capacity of T cells as well as the evaluation of changes in the suppressive&#xD;
      capacity of regulatory T cells will be evaluated. To put the obtained results into context,&#xD;
      response data of dimethyl fumarate-treated patients will be compared with data from healthy&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;

At week 2, the daily dose is further increased to 240 mg Tecfidera® p.o. in the morning and 120 mg Tecfidera® p.o. in the evening. Finally at week 3, the dose will be increased to the final daily dose of 240 mg Tecfidera® p.o. in the morning and 240 mg Tecfidera® p.o. in the evening and maintained throughout the study.</description>
