      This is a prospective, multi-center, observational registry to document the baseline, 24-hour&#xD;
      and 30-day inflammatory response and procedural outcomes out to 12 month follow-up after&#xD;
      femoropopliteal angioplasty or atherectomy-based revascularization procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To observe the femoropopliteal revascularization outcomes post-angioplasty and/or&#xD;
           atherectomy and to observe potential correlation between patency outcomes and the levels&#xD;
           of MCP-1, C-reactive protein and MMP-9 from baseline to 24 hours and 30 days&#xD;
           post-procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To provide a comparator dataset to the investigational DANCE trial, which has the same&#xD;
           enrollment criteria as this observational trial but includes the investigational use of&#xD;
           a local drug therapy to limit inflammation caused by mechanical revascularization.&#xD;
