      This is a pilot study to see whether mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, which is a type of&#xD;
      psychological therapy, is able to improve the psychological wellbeing of people who have the&#xD;
      gene for Huntington's disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Huntingdon's disease (HD) is a genetic neurodegenerative condition which causes problems with&#xD;
      movement, coordination and cognitive functioning, and emotional difficulties are also&#xD;
      commonly experienced. It is believed to affect around five to ten in 100,000 people of&#xD;
      European descent, with recent UK estimates as high as 11.2-13.5. Each child of an affected&#xD;
      person has a 50% chance of inheriting the condition. As age of diagnosis is typically around&#xD;
      35-55, with time from diagnosis to death around 20 years, those who are diagnosed have often&#xD;
      seen their parents affected by the condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many people at various stages of HD (including those who carry the gene but are&#xD;
      pre-symptomatic) experience low mood, anxiety and other psychological difficulties. Indeed,&#xD;
      alongside functional capacity, mood may be one of the main factors which contributes to&#xD;
      health related quality of life, more so than discrete motor problems, or cognitive&#xD;
      impairment. In addition, reports from patients suggest emotional and social concerns are&#xD;
      important for individuals with the condition at the pre-symptomatic stage, and these concerns&#xD;
      remain throughout the disease course. Medication may be effective to alleviate psychological&#xD;
      difficulties for some people, but its efficacy has not been conclusively proven and it is not&#xD;
      suitable for all. Psychological interventions may provide an alternative or additional way of&#xD;
      alleviating distress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although it is commonly presumed that biological factors are the main determinants of&#xD;
      psychological distress in people with HD, several studies have indicated that, while these&#xD;
      may indeed be important, psychological factors are also significant. For example beliefs&#xD;
      about the disease and coping mechanisms are associated with poorer mental health and higher&#xD;
      levels of depression. Such psychological beliefs and coping patterns can be adaptively&#xD;
      changed using psychological interventions, for example cognitive-based psychological&#xD;
      therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Little progress has been reported on the development of psychological interventions in HD&#xD;
      despite the fact that people with HD have expressed an interest in psychological approaches&#xD;
      and these are currently being successfully developed for people with other neurological&#xD;
      conditions (e.g., in people with Parkinson's disease). It is therefore proposed to pilot&#xD;
      mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) which, although originally developed to help&#xD;
      people with remitted depression from relapse, has been increasingly used to help people with&#xD;
      current difficulties. It has also been piloted with people with Parkinson's disease who found&#xD;
      it an acceptable intervention and reported improvements in self-management and psychological&#xD;
      wellbeing. In general, MBCT has also recorded other gains including improved sleep quality&#xD;
      and social functioning. It has also received sufficient evidence for it to be a recommended&#xD;
      approach in the UK NICE guidelines for people with a history of depression. MBCT can also&#xD;
      reduce anxiety and provides group support. There are also indications that mindfulness&#xD;
      training can improve neurocognitive functioning, even in people with neurodegenerative&#xD;
      disease. Finally, a psychological therapy subgroup within the European Huntington's Disease&#xD;
      Network has recently been formed, thus indicating the rise of interest in psychological&#xD;
      approaches and the timely nature of this work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence this study will provide the first indication of whether MBCT, a therapeutic approach&#xD;
      with an established evidence base, would be acceptable and useful for people with HD. In&#xD;
      order to meet this aim, MBCT will be delivered to two groups, one to individuals who carry&#xD;
      the gene but are pre-symptomatic and one to individuals who have begun to experience symptoms&#xD;
      but are at an early stage of the disease course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approaches to outcome evaluation should be incremental, with lower cost studies, e.g.,&#xD;
      qualitative investigations and case studies, being conducted before investment in randomised&#xD;
      controlled trials is considered. Thus this study will follow this guidance by collecting both&#xD;
      qualitative and quantitative data. The qualitative data will be analysed using interpretative&#xD;
      phenomenological analysis, a methodology previously used in other qualitative studies on&#xD;
      MBCT. Semi-structured interviews will provide data on the acceptability of the intervention&#xD;
      and detailed accounts of participants' experience after the intervention has been provided.&#xD;
      This will inform whether the MBCT intervention needs to be changed or adapted in further&#xD;
      trials. The quantitative data will be used to provide basic pre and post intervention&#xD;
      comparisons on a number of outcome variables relevant to MBCT, with the hypothesis that&#xD;
      performance on these measures will improve post training. These data will also be used to&#xD;
      estimate effect sizes for further trials so that these are suitably powered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the considerable physical, cognitive and emotional consequences of the disease, HD not&#xD;
      only affects the person with HD, but also those with whom they live, even in the pre-clinical&#xD;
      phase. Family members often become caregivers and can have a reduced quality of life as a&#xD;
      result, including experiencing low mood themselves. In fact, caregiver burden and caregiver&#xD;
      depression is associated with depression of the person with HD and, alongside motor&#xD;
      disturbances, depression of the person with HD is one of the main predictors of caregiver&#xD;
      burden. Partners of people with HD can also experience reduced satisfaction with their&#xD;
      relationship, sometimes more so than the person with HD themselves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus this study will also investigate the views of a family member (e.g. partner, parent,&#xD;
      child) of the person participating in the intervention. As the intervention is aimed at&#xD;
      alleviating psychological distress in the person with HD, it is hypothesised that this in&#xD;
      turn will also have an effect on the family member's wellbeing. Also, higher levels of&#xD;
      mindfulness are associated with higher levels of satisfaction in partner relationships,&#xD;
      perhaps due to more adaptive conflict resolution and better emotional recognition and&#xD;
      management. Participants in MBCT have reported increased empathy and perspective taking,&#xD;
      being more able to respond mindfully in relationships. Thus increased mindfulness of the&#xD;
      person with HD may benefit family and social relationships.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, caregivers' views about the symptoms or quality of life of the person with HD&#xD;
      may not always match the person with HD themselves. Furthermore, certain symptom changes&#xD;
      which are beneficial to the person with HD may not be so to the caregiver, and thus the&#xD;
      caregiver can offer an alternative perspective of the wellbeing (including behavioural and&#xD;
      psychological changes) of the person with HD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both qualitative and quantitative data will be collected from a family member or close friend&#xD;
      of the person with HD, where such a person is available and willing to take part.&#xD;
      Semi-structured interviews with the family member will explore their perceptions on the&#xD;
      acceptability of the intervention and experiences of the person with HD, as well as the&#xD;
      impact on the family member personally and the wider family system. Data collected pre and&#xD;
      post the intervention will assess any changes in their psychological wellbeing, caregiver&#xD;
      burden and family relationships, with the hypothesis that wellbeing and relationships will&#xD;
      improve post training and caregiver burden will decrease.&#xD;
