    <textblock>
      In this prospective multi-centre double-blind trial the effect of the X-ray examinations&#xD;
      controlled periradicular therapy should be examined in (approximately 300) adult patients&#xD;
      with low back pain pain caused by foraminal stenosis radiculopathy or spinal stenosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A periradicular therapy (PRT) is a special radiological, low-risk therapy for chronic back&#xD;
      pain caused by wear and tear of the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine or a herniated disc&#xD;
      or disc bulge. Partially pain might also radiate to the hips or extremities and cause&#xD;
      radicular symptoms.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Controlled periradicular therapy (PRT) is a microinvasive interventional pain release&#xD;
      procedure. Advantage of targeted pain therapy is exact administration of effective drugs to&#xD;
      the nerve root in the area of the thoracic, lumbar or sacral spines. It is used like as&#xD;
      effective treatment in the patients with radicular pain caused by foraminal stenosis&#xD;
      radiculopathy or spinal stenosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spinal stenosis is the narrowing of spaces in the spine which causes pressure on the spinal&#xD;
      cord and nerves. Discogenic radicular irritation syndrome is usually caused by protrusion of&#xD;
      intervertebral disc or prolapsed disc. The most common is lumbar and sacral radiculopathy&#xD;
      which could by exactly verified by CT or magnetic resonance imaging. The biggest profit with&#xD;
      the best response on this therapy has patients who are resistant for physiotherapy or per&#xD;
      oral medicament therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervertebral space verification is provided by X-ray examination imaging. Than in this&#xD;
      place is Tuohy needle inserted. Position of Tuohy needle is verified by application of low&#xD;
      dose of contrast. When the right position of needle is secured than effective drugs are&#xD;
      administered: local anesthetic - Bupivacaine 0,25% (1-2ml) together with corticosteroid&#xD;
      injection -Depo-Medrol (40mg). PRT involves several medicable effects: anaesthetic - positive&#xD;
      effect on pain transmission in nerve fibers, antichemical - limitation of chemical products&#xD;
      from sequestered discs, Anti-edematous - reduction of root nerve oedema, antiphlogistic -&#xD;
      inhibition of phospholipase A2, antifibrotic - reduction of scar production.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial will compare groups of patients after fulfilment inclusion criteria's who will undergo&#xD;
      microinvasive interventional pain release procedure - PRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first group of patients will undergo PRT procedure in the intervertebral space&#xD;
      responsible for skin dermatome were the pain is radiating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second group of patients will undergo double PRT procedure in the intervertebral space&#xD;
      responsible for skin dermatome where the pain is radiating and also in the intervertebral&#xD;
      space above where usually is disc lesion responsible for origin of pain localized. After&#xD;
      first visit in ambulance patients will be about study informed. After agreement patient will&#xD;
      be in to the study involved. Specific unique nine digits number will be assigned to each&#xD;
      patient. Then patients will be randomized in to groups by special evaluated software created&#xD;
      especially for this study. Patients will agree that about type of PRT (one level or two&#xD;
      levels) will be informed until the end of the study. This way will be patients blinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second examination will be provided after 6 months. Patients will be in the beginning&#xD;
      introduced to doctor only by their unique number. Doctor will be blinded and he will not&#xD;
      dispose with information about microinvasive procedure and will examine patient. Data which&#xD;
      will be collected: (Visual analogue scale, pain radiating dermatome, global pain scale,&#xD;
      changes in analgesics drugs consumption). All acquired information will be noted in to the&#xD;
      special anonymous protocol. Also patients will anonymously fulfill Oswestry Low Back&#xD;
      Disability Questionnaire. The third examination will be provided after 12 months same way.&#xD;
      Patients will be in the beginning introduced to doctor only by their unique number. Doctor&#xD;
      will be blinded and he will not dispose with information about microinvasive procedure and&#xD;
      will examine patient. Data which will be collected: (Visual analogue scale, dermatome where&#xD;
      pain is radiating, global pain scale, changes in analgesics drugs consumption). All acquired&#xD;
      information will be noted in to the special anonymous protocol. Also patients will&#xD;
      anonymously fulfill Oswestry Low Back Disability Questionnaire (ODI). If the patient will&#xD;
      need to a see a doctor in the reason of deterioration of pain feeling and if the ODI will not&#xD;
      increase more than 10% against patient's origin ODI value than one PRT is allowed in the&#xD;
      spinal space responding to a pain radiating dermatome during first six months after patients&#xD;
      inclusion to trial. Under the same conditions another PRT is allowed during next six months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When ODI will increase more than 10% against patient's origin ODI value and more than 1 PRT&#xD;
      during six month interval will be needed, than patient will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
