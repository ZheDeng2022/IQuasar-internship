  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies reported that myoelectrical activity increased during whole body vibration&#xD;
      (WBV). The investigators hypothesized that the change in soleus muscle length does not affect&#xD;
      the whole body vibration induced soleus reflex muscle activity but the change in ankle angle&#xD;
      affects the whole body induced soleus reflex muscle activity. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      test this hypothesis.&#xD;

      Eighteen healthy young adult men are planned to include in this study. Surface electrodes&#xD;
      will be placed on the right soleus muscle's belly. The electrodes (10-mm in diameter,&#xD;
      inter-electrode distance of 20 mm) were arranged in the direction of the muscle fibers. The&#xD;
      skin overlying the muscle was shaved, light abrasion was applied, and the skin was cleaned&#xD;
      using 70% alcohol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A piezo-electric accelerometer (LIS344ALH full-scale of ±6 g linear accelerometer, ECOPACK)&#xD;
      will be placed on the achilles tendon and a force sensor (FC2331-0000-2000L Compression Load&#xD;
      Sensor, France) will be placed under the right heel. All data will be recorded by PowerLab&#xD;
      (data acquisition system, ADInstruments, Australia) device. The data were processed offline&#xD;
      with a computer. All surface electromyography (SEMG) analyses were conducted using a software&#xD;
      (LABCHART7 ver. 7.3.3; POWERLAB System, ADInstruments). All SEMG recordings were 80-500 Hz&#xD;
      band-pass filtered. Root-mean-square values (RMS) were calculated from the filtered SEMG&#xD;
      signal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WBV (PowerPlate Pro5) with high amplitude at 35 Hz will be applied. Participants were&#xD;
      barefooted, and no sponge or foam was placed between the vibration platform and their feet.&#xD;
      Participants will stand in different position with their knees locked during WBV. Their hips&#xD;
      and knees were in a neutral position. Positions: Position-1: Upright standing on zero sloping&#xD;
      vibration platform Position-2: Standing with 10 degrees ankle dorsiflexion on zero sloping&#xD;
      vibration platform Position-3: Standing with 20 degrees ankle plantarflexion on zero sloping&#xD;
      vibration platform Position-4: Upright standing on twenty degrees forward inclined vibration&#xD;
      platform (angle angle will be 20 degrees ankle plantarflexion) Position-5: Leaning forward&#xD;
      while standing on twenty degrees forward inclined vibration platform (angle angle will be&#xD;
      neutral) Position-6: Upright standing on 10 degrees backward inclined vibration platform&#xD;
      (angle angle will be 20 degrees ankle dorsiflexion) Position-7: Leaning backward while&#xD;
      standing on 10 degrees backward inclined vibration platform (angle angle will be neutral)&#xD;
      Sequence of the position will be random. Maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) was determined&#xD;
      for each subject at the beginning of each position using magnitude of force between heel and&#xD;
      vibration platform the when the subject attempted to activate the soleus muscle maximally.&#xD;
      Then vibration exposure will be 30 seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants were instructed to relax their muscles throughout the recordings during WBV&#xD;
      and were trained using electromyographic feedback to this end. WBV may impair the sense of&#xD;
      balance and muscles may be activated to restore balance. To overcome this problem, the&#xD;
      participants were familiarized with WBV with a 15 s trial session on the WBV device and they&#xD;
      were asked to use the handles of the device to secure their balance.&#xD;
