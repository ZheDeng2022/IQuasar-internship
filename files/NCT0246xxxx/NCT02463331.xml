      The gold-standard treatment of Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), with prednisone alone or in&#xD;
      conjunction with azathioprine can reach resolution of the disease in 70-80% of the cases in&#xD;
      US. However, in Brazil the response to these treatments seems to be worse, approximately 35%&#xD;
      in five years. Because of the side effects of the gold-standard treatment and the need for an&#xD;
      alternative option for the no responsive patients, news drugs must be evaluated for this&#xD;
      proposal. Chloroquine diphosphate is an antimalarial drug that has been used for the&#xD;
      treatment of rheumatological diseases for at the least five decades. Chloroquine was used as&#xD;
      a single drug for up to two years for the maintenance of AIH remission in an open study.&#xD;
      There was a 6.49 greater chance of relapse in the historical controls when compared with&#xD;
      patients treated with chloroquine (72.2% x 23.5%; p = 0.031). The aim of this study was to&#xD;
      investigate whether chloroquine in conjunction with prednisone can be used as an alternative&#xD;
      treatment of AIH in a randomized study, and to evaluate its side effects.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a chronic disease with a progressive destruction of hepatic&#xD;
      parenchyma, leading to cirrhosis and high mortality in the absence of specific treatment. It&#xD;
      has been demonstrated that the treatment with corticosteroids and azathioprine provides&#xD;
      clinical and laboratory improvement, reduction of histological inflammatory activity on liver&#xD;
      biopsy and an increased survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of the side effects of the gold-standard treatment and the need for an alternative&#xD;
      option for the no responsive patients, news drugs must be evaluated for this proposal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chloroquine is a drug of the group of 4-aminoquinolines, synthetic derivatives of quinine and&#xD;
      constituent of the bark of the Cinchona tree. Chloroquine accumulates in tissues in&#xD;
      considerable amounts. In animals, from 200 to 700 times the plasma concentration can be found&#xD;
      in liver, spleen, kidneys and lungs. As a weak base, it accumulates intracellularly,&#xD;
      particularly in lysosomes with a consequent increase in pH within these organelles, which&#xD;
      could contribute to its toxicity. Lysosomal lamellar bodies are observed in tissues affected&#xD;
      by chloroquine, such as retina and neuromuscular system. Chloroquine inhibits the absorption&#xD;
      and the binding of mitochondrial calcium, alters the membrane permeability and the transport&#xD;
      of enzymes to the lysosomes. Apparently there are other mechanisms to explain its&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory action; such as the interference with the release of TNF from mononuclear&#xD;
      phagocytes by inhibiting gene expression and the down-regulation of TNF receptors, by&#xD;
      delaying their transport to the cellular surface. Due to these mechanisms of action,&#xD;
      chloroquine has anti-inflammatory activities and therefore is used in diseases such as&#xD;
      rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. In liver diseases, chloroquine was&#xD;
      used in patients with hepatitis B with normalization of the levels of aminotransferases and&#xD;
      of the prothrombin time during treatment and relapse after drug discontinuation. Chloroquine&#xD;
      was also evaluated in patients with porphyria cutanea tarda and despite the clinical and&#xD;
      biochemical improvement, liver biopsies remained unchanged after one year of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A previous pilot study was performed in our institution, and published in 2005, with&#xD;
      chloroquine diphosphate for the maintenance treatment of AIH. In this study, 14 patients with&#xD;
      a biochemical and histological remission were treated with chloroquine diphosphate 250 mg/day&#xD;
      for at least 12 months or until disease recurrence, and compared with 18 historical controls,&#xD;
      which was held in discontinuation of treatment after remission. The chance of relapse was&#xD;
      6.49 times higher in the historical controls when compared with patients in the group treated&#xD;
      with chloroquine (72.2% versus 23.5%, p = 0.031). The use of chloroquine was safe in patients&#xD;
      with liver cirrhosis without decompensation, and there were no serious adverse events within&#xD;
      two years of use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most common adverse effects of chloroquine are mild and transient such as&#xD;
      gastrointestinal symptoms, headache, dizziness, blurry vision and fatigue. The more severe&#xD;
      reactions described are itching, cardiovascular manifestations, dyskinesias, eye injuries,&#xD;
      neuromuscular disorders and hearing loss. Among the most feared adverse effects of&#xD;
      chloroquine, are the eye injuries, usually associated with chronic treatment. They may&#xD;
      consist of changes in the retina, lens, cornea and optic nerve. Usually they remain stable&#xD;
      after drug withdrawal, if the drug is discontinued in early stages. However, the retinal&#xD;
      damage can increase when found in advanced stages, and may progress even years after&#xD;
      cessation of chloroquine. It is believed that the chloroquine retinopathy can be prevented or&#xD;
      recognized in an early reversible stage with judicious use, appropriate doses and regular&#xD;
      ophthalmologic follow-up. It is recommended that the daily dose does not exceed 250 mg of&#xD;
      chloroquine diphosphate or 400 mg of hydroxychloroquine, and ophthalmologic evaluations are&#xD;
      carried out every 4 to 6 months. Despite the adverse effects and toxic reactions described&#xD;
      above, there is a consensus in most studies with chloroquine that it is a well tolerated&#xD;
      drug, provided that the appropriate dosage guidelines and regular eye examinations are&#xD;
      followed. With these cautions in mind, its use rarely causes serious side or irreversible&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study was to investigate whether chloroquine in conjunction with prednisone&#xD;
      can be used as an alternative treatment of AIH in a randomized study, and to evaluate its&#xD;
      side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To be included patients had to satisfy the following criteria simultaneously: a diagnosis of&#xD;
      probable / definite AIH and the indication of treatment (according to the International AIH&#xD;
      Group), normal liver function and absence of clinical signs of decompensated liver disease&#xD;
      (ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, gastrointestinal bleeding and hepatocellular carcinoma).&#xD;
      For their enrollment, it is necessary that the patients are in accordance with the proposed&#xD;
      study, following the precepts of the Declaration of Helsinki. If patients refuse to&#xD;
      participate in the study, they will be treated following the traditional guidelines of our&#xD;
      service. Treatment will be discontinued in case of pregnancy, patient's desire, side-effects&#xD;
      or relapse of AIH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were randomized to receive azathioprine and prednisone or chloroquine and&#xD;
      prednisone. The alternative treatment, with chloroquine, was maintained unless it caused&#xD;
      major side-effects, no biochemical response or treatment failure. In this case, azathioprine&#xD;
      was introduced in association with prednisone. All patients had visits every 30 days during&#xD;
      the first six months with routine blood tests performed. After then, consultations were every&#xD;
      two months. All complaints were recorded. Every patient were treated by the doctors&#xD;
      responsible for the study, laboratory tests were performed in the Central Laboratory of the&#xD;
      hospital. All patients underwent to initial ophthalmologic evaluation followed by six-monthly&#xD;
      evaluations. The drug was withdrawal, if changes suggestive of retinopathy were observed.&#xD;
