    <textblock>
      The SUpporting Seniors Receiving Treatment And INtervention (SUSTAIN) program is a&#xD;
      telephone-based clinical service designed to help identify and manage behavioral health&#xD;
      issues among PACE/PACENET enrollees. The purpose of the current project is to a) explore&#xD;
      moderators of treatment response among beneficiaries in the SUSTAIN Clinical Program and b)&#xD;
      to evaluate the sustained clinical effects of the program.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The SUpporting Seniors Receiving Treatment And INtervention (SUSTAIN) program is an&#xD;
      evidence-based clinical service administered via telephone and designed to help identify and&#xD;
      manage behavioral health issues among enrollees of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania&#xD;
      Department of Aging's Pharmaceutical Assistance Contract for the Elderly (PACE) and the PACE&#xD;
      Needs Enhancement Tier (PACENET) Program who have been newly prescribed psychotropic&#xD;
      medications. The SUSTAIN program has adapted the existing software and staffing model from&#xD;
      Penn's Behavioral Health Laboratory (BHL), which has been used to integrate Mental Health&#xD;
      (MH) care within primary care in other health systems, including the VA where it was&#xD;
      originally developed. The SUSTAIN program is a novel and flexible clinical service that&#xD;
      addresses some of the barriers that hinder treatment outcomes for MH problems. Given the fact&#xD;
      that the SUSTAIN program provides assessment, monitoring, early intervention, disease&#xD;
      management, and referral management over the telephone, the program can be tailored to each&#xD;
      individual's specific needs. The SUSTAIN program also overcomes logistical barriers such as&#xD;
      the necessity of frequent face-to-face contact in specialty programs, and thus can enhance&#xD;
      existing specialty care programs by reducing wait times and &quot;no-show&quot; rates. As a result, the&#xD;
      SUSTAIN program has the potential to result in higher patient satisfaction, improved health,&#xD;
      and, accordingly, greater independent functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SUSTAIN program assesses individuals with behavioral health issues and offers a subset of&#xD;
      these individuals ongoing follow-up services based on clinical need and symptom severity.&#xD;
      Follow-up service options include Monitoring and Care Management. Monitoring consists of up&#xD;
      to 4 brief (5-10 minutes), structured assessments following the baseline assessment. These&#xD;
      follow-up contacts are conducted over the telephone by the Heath Technician (HT) or&#xD;
      Behavioral Health Provider (BHP) and take place during the initial 12 weeks of pharmaceutical&#xD;
      treatment. These brief interviews monitor symptoms, adherence, side effects, and response to&#xD;
      treatment. Care Management is algorithm-driven care for conditions such as depression, panic&#xD;
      disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and chronic pain, and is delivered by a BHP as an&#xD;
      adjunct to primary care. The BHP monitors and encourages patient acceptance and adherence to&#xD;
      treatment recommendations through support, education, and motivational engagement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will evaluate the extent to which SUSTAIN is related to program&#xD;
      participants' outcomes. The evaluation of the program relies on 2 sources of data: 1) a&#xD;
      retrospective chart review of data collected as part of the clinical program, which includes&#xD;
      data from the baseline and follow-up clinical interviews, and 2) data collected during a&#xD;
      one-time 6 Month Outcome Research Evaluation interview completed with SUSTAIN program&#xD;
      participants who provide verbal consent. The retrospective chart review will evaluate the&#xD;
      clinical data from 3000 PACE/PACENET enrollees who participate in the PACE/PACENET SUSTAIN&#xD;
      Clinical Program (which includes both Monitoring and Care Management). The 6 Month Outcome&#xD;
      Research Evaluation will evaluate long term outcomes among a subset of participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Program Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Referred PACE/PACENET enrollees are contacted to complete an initial baseline clinical&#xD;
      interview. Following the baseline interview, enrollees are offered several different&#xD;
      services, depending on clinical need: Referral Management, Care Management, or Monitoring.&#xD;
      Enrollee participation in the program occurs over the span of up to six months, with the&#xD;
      number of calls based upon the follow-up service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Retrospective Chart Review Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The retrospective chart review of the clinical data (i.e., data collected at baseline and&#xD;
      during Monitoring and Care Management visits) will be conducted and saved as a separate&#xD;
      research database. The research database will be de-identified (but include coded data) and&#xD;
      kept in a separate password protected file.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. 6 Month Outcome Research Evaluation Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      PACE/PACENET enrollees who participate in the SUSTAIN Clinical Program will be asked to&#xD;
      provide verbal HIPAA authorization and consent for participation in the 6 Month Outcome&#xD;
      Research Evaluation at the end of the acute phase of clinical care, usually at three months.&#xD;
      Enrollees providing verbal consent to participate in the 6 Month Outcome Research Evaluations&#xD;
      will be called again at 6 months following the date of the initial clinical interview. At the&#xD;
      6 Month Outcome Research call, assessments will be conducted that mirror the SUSTAIN Clinical&#xD;
      Program baseline assessment.&#xD;
