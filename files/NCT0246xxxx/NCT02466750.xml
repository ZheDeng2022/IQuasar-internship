    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to collect safety and immunogenicity data for the WEE vaccine,&#xD;
      TSI-GSD 210. Enrollment in this protocol is offered for personnel who enter areas where this&#xD;
      virus is used in research or is endemic (an area where this disease process is found to occur&#xD;
      frequently).&#xD;

    <description>Immunogenicity data will be collected for all subjects and will be evaluated for all per-protocol subjects. The primary immunogenicity endpoint measurements will be the percentage of per-protocol subjects who develop titers of ≥ 1:40 as determined by PRNT80 after WEE vaccination at each scheduled time point for which blood samples are drawn and over the entire study period to study completion.</description>

    <description>Subjects receive 3 doses off WEE vaccine on Day 0, Day 7 ± 2 days, and Day 28-35 days. A booster will be administered on Day 180 ± 14 days and a sample collected for PRNT80 28-35 days later.</description>

    <description>Subjects who previously received the WEE vaccine under another protocol and have a PRNT80 &lt; 1:40. Boosters (and follow-up titers 28-35 days later) may continue while the subject has titers of &lt; 1:40 for a maximum of 4 booster doses in a year. If the titer remains &lt; 1:40 after 4 booster doses in 1 year, the subject will not be given WEE vaccine for 1 year. If the titer is &lt; 1:40 after that interval, one booster dose will be given and the titer will be assayed. If the immune response to the last booster dose is &lt; 1:40, the subject will be considered to have completed the study as a nonresponder.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Be 18 to 65 years old at time of consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Have WEE plaque reduction neutralization 80% titers (PRNT80) &lt; 1:10 for primary&#xD;
             series.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Have WEE PRNT80 &lt; 1:40 for booster series.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. If female of childbearing potential, must agree to have a urine pregnancy test on the&#xD;
             same day before each vaccine. (Exception: documented hysterectomy or ≥ 3 years of&#xD;
             menopause.) The results must be negative. Females must agree to not become pregnant&#xD;
             for 3 months after receipt of the last study treatment (vaccination).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Be considered at risk for exposure to WEE virus and who have submitted a Request for&#xD;

             duration of the subject's participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Agree to defer blood, bone marrow, and organ donation for 1 year after receipt of the&#xD;

             hepatitis C, hepatitis B carrier state) or elevated liver function tests (two times&#xD;
             the normal range or at the discretion of the PI).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Have a personal history of an immunodeficiency or received treatment with an&#xD;
             immunosuppressive medication, such as systemically administered glucocorticoids (eg,&#xD;
             prednisone) within 1 month before planned administration of the vaccine or with other&#xD;
             immunosuppressive therapies within 6 months of planned administration of the vaccine.&#xD;
             Other immunosuppressive therapies include all cancer chemotherapeutic agents, drugs to&#xD;
             prevent transplant rejection, interferons, monoclonal antibodies, protein kinase&#xD;
             inhibitors, methotrexate, TNF (tumor necrosis factor) inhibitors, and any other drug&#xD;
             determined to be immunosuppressive by the PI. Current administration of topical,&#xD;
             inhalational, or intranasal glucocorticoids is not excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Have a confirmed HIV infection (antibody positivity).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Have a positive pregnancy test or be a breastfeeding female.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Have any known allergies to components of the vaccine:&#xD;

             formaldehyde eggs neomycin sulfate human serum albumin sodium bisulfite&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Have administration of another vaccine or investigational product within 28 days of&#xD;
             WEE vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Have any unresolved AE resulting from a previous immunization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. A medical condition that, in the judgment of the PI, would impact subject safety.&#xD;
