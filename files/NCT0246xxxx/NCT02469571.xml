      Background Sepsis is a common disease leading to high morbidity and mortality. Gut microbiota&#xD;
      and/or gut permeability may play a crucial role in the development of organ dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis The ingestion of a multispecies probiotic in early sepsis is able to modulate gut&#xD;
      microbiota and/or gut permeability.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis is a systemic deleterious host response to infection causing major healthcare&#xD;
      problems. Sepsis affects millions of people around the world each year, with a lethality of&#xD;
      25%-50%. The incidence is increasing partly because of a raise in average age and occurrence&#xD;
      of predisposing diseases in the population, and partly because of shifts in causative&#xD;
      pathogens. Effectiveness of therapy administered in the initial hours of severe sepsis&#xD;
      critically influences the clinical outcome of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lacking reliable biomarkers for early stages, the diagnosis of (severe) sepsis relies on a&#xD;
      combination of surrogate parameters indicating end organ dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, gut wall integrity has been identified as a key feature in protecting the body&#xD;
      against potentially harmful compounds such as bacteria, toxins and antigens. The gut barrier&#xD;
      consists of the mucus barrier, antimicrobial peptides, secretory IgA, the epithelial barrier,&#xD;
      and the gut immune system. Gut permeability is reported to increase in sepsis and to play a&#xD;
      key role in the development of multi-organ dysfunction. Therefore, gut permeability markers&#xD;
      might have the potential to predict the risk of progression from sepsis to severe sepsis. The&#xD;
      mechanisms leading to increased gut permeability are not completely clear, yet. Direct and&#xD;
      indirect interactions of pathogens, hormonal imbalances, beta-adrenergic activity,&#xD;
      hyperglycemia and cytokine activation as well as individual predisposition have been&#xD;
      proposed. It seems that increased gut permeability is the common final pathway of a multitude&#xD;
      of influencing factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, the importance of gut microbiota composition has recently been recognized in&#xD;
      several diseases; however, not much is known about the role of the microbiome in sepsis to&#xD;
      date. Available data suggest, that disturbances in microbiome homeostasis are present in&#xD;
      sepsis, but it is yet unknown if these changes are cause or consequence of sepsis. Changes in&#xD;
      gut barrier and/or gut microbiota can lead to an increase in microbial products in&#xD;
      circulation, contributing to (inadequate) activation and later &quot;paralysis&quot; of immune cells.&#xD;
      It is not yet known if the gut microbiome of a patient in early stages of sepsis differs from&#xD;
      the healthy microbiome or from the microbiome of a patient in late stages of sepsis. Also,&#xD;
      the possibility to modulate the gut microbiome in early sepsis has not been studied yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A typical strategy to modulate the gut microbiome is the use of probiotic bacteria. In&#xD;
      sepsis, the use of probiotics is well established for specific indications, such as&#xD;
      necrotising enterocolitis in neonates, however, studies in adults are scarce. Therefore the&#xD;
      aim of this study is to investigate if the ingestion of a multispecies probiotic in early&#xD;
      sepsis is able to modulate gut microbiota and/or gut permeability and observe the clinical&#xD;
      outcome of treated patients.&#xD;
