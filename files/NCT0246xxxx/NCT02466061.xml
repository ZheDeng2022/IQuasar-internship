      This randomized, controlled study evaluates the efficacy of weigh loss interventions in&#xD;
      endometrial cancer survivors, using novel technology-based weight loss platforms. This is a&#xD;
      multi-site, pilot feasibility study which will provide preliminary data to support a larger&#xD;
      NIH funded, mult-center trial.&#xD;

      Study Aims The relationship between endometrial cancer (EC) and obesity is well established.&#xD;
      However, few studies have examined the acceptability and potential efficacy of an&#xD;
      intervention to promote weight reduction and alter cancer-associated biomarkers in&#xD;
      endometrial cancer survivors. This investigation has two specific aims.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the efficacy of novel technology-based weight loss interventions: a) telephone&#xD;
      encounters and wireless scales, or b) smart phone personalized text messaging as compared to&#xD;
      c) an enhanced usual care group for women with obesity and a history of endometrial cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Women in both the telemedicine and text intervention arms will lose significantly&#xD;
      more weight than women in the enhanced usual care arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1a) To explore patients' understanding of the relationship between obesity and endometrial&#xD;
      cancer and, 1b) to survey the acceptability of novel and different approaches to weight loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The investigators anticipate that this study will validate pilot data from a&#xD;
      predecessor single-institution study demonstrating that &gt;25% of patients will not be aware of&#xD;
      the association between excess body weight and endometrial cancer. Investigators also will&#xD;
      assess the acceptability of various interventions designed to promote weight loss (i.e. in&#xD;
      person counseling, phone-based, text messaging) and predict a greater interest in&#xD;
      interventions that require fewer in-person visits to the clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3 arm randomized controlled trial, weight loss intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre and post intervention patient reported psychosocial measures&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre and post intervention Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) to explore impact of&#xD;
           weight loss on body fat distribution&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre and post intervention analyses of the following biomarkers: insulin-like growth&#xD;
           factor-binding protein 1 (IGFBP-1); adiponectin, vascular endothelial growth factor&#xD;
           (VEGF), C reactive protein (CRP), interleukin 1-beta (IL1-beta), interleukin 2 (IL2),&#xD;
           interleukin 6 (IL6), interleukin 7 (IL7), and interleukin 8 (IL8)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Patient-reported survey to assess knowledge of correlation of Body Mass Index (BMI)&#xD;
      with endometrial cancer incidence&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Adult women with biopsy-proven endometrial cancer (Types I and II), BMI â‰¥ 30 kg/m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Aim 2 population plus Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status&#xD;
      (PS) 0-1, no concurrent chemo or radiation therapy, and access to wireless internet and/or&#xD;
      smart phone device.&#xD;
