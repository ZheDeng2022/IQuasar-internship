  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes is a national epidemic. Diabetes has undesirable effects on blood vessels&#xD;
      which may contribute to heart disease. Endothelial Progenitor Cells (EPCs) are found in the&#xD;
      blood. Research has shown that improving the survival of these special blood cells may&#xD;
      decrease the harmful effects of diabetes on blood vessels and reduce or reverse heart&#xD;
      disease. Linagliptin is an Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved prescription medicine&#xD;
      used along with insulin or with oral medications to lower blood sugar in people with Type 2&#xD;
      diabetes. It is in a class of diabetes medication called Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4)&#xD;
      inhibitors. DPP-4 inhibitors have been shown to increase EPCs in patients with Type 2&#xD;
      diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Both type 2 diabetes and Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) are associated with poor&#xD;
      stem cell number and function. Poor viability and function of EPCs in CKD and diabetes The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that use of Linagliptin (along with Insulin) may help reduce&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk by improving EPC survival and function above and beyond adequate glucose&#xD;
      metabolism control&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes is a national epidemic with significant macro and microvascular&#xD;
      complications. Insulin resistance in pre-diabetes and overt diabetes are associated with&#xD;
      endothelial dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A few studies indicate that stem cells particularly EPCs can act as a suitable bio-marker for&#xD;
      monitoring cardiovascular morbidity. In this proposal the investigators suggest that EPCs or&#xD;
      CD34 positive cells (defined as CD34/vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2+)&#xD;
      cells) can act as a suitable cellular biomarker for estimating and following endothelial&#xD;
      dysfunction in early type 2 diabetes patients with CKD. EPCs have been shown to be&#xD;
      dysfunctional in both CKD patients and type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (DM) patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Linagliptin (TRADJENTA) tablets are indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve&#xD;
      glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. No dose adjustment is recommended&#xD;
      for patients with renal impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EPCs have been used as a regenerative tool in ischemic myocardium and diabetic wound healing.&#xD;
      Endothelial dysfunction with associated inflammation may be a consequence of excess&#xD;
      intra-cellular super-oxide presence in a setting of diabetes which is a pro-oxidative stress&#xD;
      condition ultimately leading to poor EPC function and senescence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Though lifestyle modification has been proposed as a main stay for prevention and treatment&#xD;
      of early type 2 diabetes, several new therapies for diabetes have been developed in recent&#xD;
      years. Incretins and incretin mimetics appear to hold promise. Mechanism of positive effect&#xD;
      of exercise and oral hypoglycemic agents can be very different.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DPP-4 inhibitors have been shown to increase EPCs in patients with type 2 diabetes reportedly&#xD;
      via stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1) alpha up-regulation. Interestingly, up-regulation&#xD;
      of SDF-1 alpha and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), both chemotactic factors&#xD;
      increase mobilization and recruitment of EPCs in the face of acute ischemic injury for repair&#xD;
      and regeneration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have shown positive effect of incretins (Glucagon like peptide, GLP-1) and&#xD;
      incretin receptor agonists (GLP-1 receptor agonists) on cardiovascular risk factors in type 2&#xD;
      diabetes patients and even in patients with chronic heart failure and left ventricular&#xD;
      dysfunction who do not have diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DPP-4 Inhibitors may have cardio-protective effects of their own, as they increase&#xD;
      bio-availability of endogenous GLP-1. They improve blood flow and nitric oxide production in&#xD;
      endothelium. These are unique properties not demonstrated by other oral diabetes medications.&#xD;
      The mechanism underlying these effects may be mediated by increased nitric oxide&#xD;
      bioavailability but is not completely known. However these beneficial effects appear to be&#xD;
      independent of glycemia reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is however unknown whether Linagliptin will have any positive effect on human EPC function&#xD;
      where two prominent cardiovascular risk factors co-exist such as CKD and type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore the investigators plan to investigate if Linagliptin can alter function and gene&#xD;
      expression of CD34+ cells in a setting of CKD and type 2 diabetes. The investigators choose&#xD;
      to look at non geriatric adult population with early type 2 diabetes (less than 10 years of&#xD;
      duration) at an early phase of renal impairment (stages 1-3).&#xD;
