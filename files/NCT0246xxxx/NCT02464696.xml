  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial studies how well non-invasive ventilation works in reducing&#xD;
      the need for intubation, or placement of a tube in the windpipe, in patients with cancer and&#xD;
      respiratory failure. Respiratory failure is a condition in which not enough oxygen passes&#xD;
      from the lungs to the blood, and is a common cause of admission to the emergency room in&#xD;
      patients with hematological and solid tumor patients. Non-invasive positive pressure&#xD;
      ventilation (NIPPV) is a method of delivering oxygen using a mask. It is not yet known&#xD;
      whether NIPPV is better at improving the amount of oxygen in the blood, reducing shortness of&#xD;
      breath, and the need for intubation than standard high flow oxygen (a tube with 2 prongs&#xD;
      placed in the nostrils) in patients with cancer and respiratory failure.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the percent of patients who meet criteria for intubation within 28 days of&#xD;
      study inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A (NIPPV THERAPY): Patients undergo intermittent NIPPV, with the recommended schedule&#xD;
      comprising 2 hours on NIPPV followed by =&lt; 2 hours off NIPPV and continuous NIPPV at night or&#xD;
      while sleeping for 8 hours per day, for 28 days or until discharged from the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B (HIGH FLOW OXYGEN THERAPY): Patients continue to receive high flow nasal cannula oxygen&#xD;
      therapy using current protocol for titration of high flow oxygen therapy for 28 days or until&#xD;
      discharged from the hospital. Patients may receive NIPPV if they develop evidence of&#xD;
      accessory muscle use with breathing or at the discretion of the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IDIOPATHIC PULMONARY SYNDROME (IPS) SUBGROUP (INCLUDING DIFFUSE ALVEOLAR HEMORRHAGE):&#xD;
      Patients with IPS receive methylprednisolone daily on days 0-48 and every other day (QOD) on&#xD;
      days 49-55 in parallel with NIPPV or oxygen therapy, with a taper at the discretion of the&#xD;
      treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study, patients are followed up until day 100.&#xD;

    <description>Fisher's exact test or a chi-squared test will be used to assess the association between two categorical variables. The intubation rate by 28 days and 95% confidence intervals will be estimated for each treatment arm. Logistic regression will be utilized to assess the effect of patient prognostic factors on the intubation rate by 28 days.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to intubation</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 28 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Kaplan-Meier method will be used to estimate the time-to-event distribution for each treatment group, and the median time will be provided. The log-rank test will be used to examine the time-to-event distribution of the active treatment group versus that of the control. Time to intubation rate at different time points will be provided by treatment group (i.e. at 7 days, 14 days, 21 days, and 28 days). Since there might be other competing risks for intubation, a competing risk analysis will be performed treating these early events as a competing event for intubation.</description>
