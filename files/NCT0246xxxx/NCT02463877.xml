    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of surgical techniques involving&#xD;
      minimal entry into the living body approach for tumor reduction and treatment in which highly&#xD;
      concentrated anticancer drugs are put directly into the abdomen through a tubes (HIPEC), and&#xD;
      to determine if this approach may improve short-term postoperative outcomes, including the&#xD;
      development of complications related to surgery within the first 30 days after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in this study is entirely voluntary. Approximately 30 subjects will take part&#xD;
      in this single-center study and all will be enrolled at University of California San Diego.&#xD;

      Potential patients will be prospectively identified prior to the time of operation based on&#xD;
      the inclusion/exclusion criteria . Those who meet the eligibility criteria and sign consent&#xD;
      will undergo laparoscopy. During laparoscopy, the peritoneal cancer index (PCI) will be&#xD;
      determined for all patients. The PCI is a scoring system that was developed to standardize&#xD;
      the assessment of disease burden. PCI is determined by assigning a Lesion size score (LSS) to&#xD;
      each of the 13 peritoneal regions and then summing the scores (defined further below). Those&#xD;
      with a PCI of ≤10 will continue with laparoscopic cytoreduction and HIPEC. Patients with a&#xD;
      PCI of &gt;10 will have an open cytoreduction and HIPEC. The Investigators plan to enroll 30&#xD;
      patients, though the investigators estimate 18 will ultimately undergo laparoscopic&#xD;
      cytoreduction and HIPEC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stage 1 will enroll 9 patients, and if 2 or less patients experience postoperative&#xD;
           complications within 30 days of HIPEC the investigators will proceed to stage 2. If 3 or&#xD;
           more patients experience postoperative complications the investigators will terminate&#xD;
           the trial early secondary to futility.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stage 2 will enroll 9 additional patients, and if the investigators have 4 or less&#xD;
           patients with postoperative complications out of the total 18 patients the investigators&#xD;
           will reject the null hypothesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1- screening&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  History and physical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Routine blood tests standard for monitoring of patient's disease include a complete&#xD;
           blood count, kidney and liver chemistries, and tumor markers (CEA and carbohydrate&#xD;
           antigen 19-9 (CA19-9)) if not already performed;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Imaging tests per standard of care (chest x-ray, CT scan; PET Scan); possibly&#xD;
           laparoscopy or colonoscopy (both scan patients abdomen area); if not performed prior to&#xD;
           consultation at University of California, San Diego (UCSD)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electrocardiogram (ECG); thallium heart scan or echocardiogram if history of cardiac&#xD;
           disease (prior Myocardial Infarction, Congestive Heart Failure, angina, cardiomyopathy,&#xD;
           vascular dysfunction and arrhythmia)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2 - operation/ surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam and updated medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Routine blood tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Laparoscopic exploration prior to cytoreduction, will be performed, per local standard&#xD;
           of care for assessment of PCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HIPEC will be administered per local standard of care..&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A greater omentectomy will be performed routinely in all cases as is done in open&#xD;
           cytoreduction. Greater and lesser omentectomy, omental bursectomy, splenectomy, left and&#xD;
           right upper quadrant and pelvic peritonectomy, cholecystectomy, total abdominal&#xD;
           hysterectomy, low anterior resection and/or gastrectomy will be performed at the&#xD;
           surgeon's discretion based on volume and distribution of peritoneal surface malignancy&#xD;
           with the aim of achieving complete resection of all grossly apparent disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Peritonectomy and organ resection will be performed to achieve optimal cytoreduction&#xD;
           (defined as removal of all gross disease or cytoreduction to gross deposits less than&#xD;
           2.5 mm in thickness).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If it is determined that optimal cytoreduction cannot be achieved with&#xD;
           minimally-invasive techniques, the procedure will be converted to an open operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Laparotomy -In cases where minimally-invasive optimal cytoreduction is achieved, a small&#xD;
           (4 to 6 cm) laparotomy incision will be made when necessary for organ extraction and a&#xD;
           wound protector will be used. The mini-laparotomy incision will be utilized for&#xD;
           insertion of HIPEC catheters.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Temporary skin closure will be performed at all port sites and incisions for&#xD;
           closed-HIPEC. Bowel anastomoses and fascial closure of port sites ≥ 1 cm and of&#xD;
           mini-laparotomy incisions will be performed after completion of HIPEC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Completeness of cytoreduction will be estimated and recorded using the system shown&#xD;
           below. Intra-peritoneal tubes and drains will be placed at the surgeon's discretion and&#xD;
           the incision closed in the usual fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After the procedure, the patient will stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) for about&#xD;
           24-48 hours. For at least 4 hours after the procedure the patient will be asked to stay&#xD;
           in bed. The patient will then stay in the hospital for approximately 3-5 days after the&#xD;
           procedure. This is part of the standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery must start within 8 weeks from time of screening. Surgery must be performed by a&#xD;
      surgeon experienced in cytoreductive and HIPEC surgery who has met the credentialing&#xD;
      requirements of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-perfusion protocol and perfusion circuit set-up and priming:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the conclusion of cytoreductive surgery, hemodynamic stability of the patient will be&#xD;
      assured and bleeding points controlled per standard of practice. Systemic body temperature&#xD;
      will be monitored. The perfusion system will be assembled per the operator's manual utilizing&#xD;
      sterile technique. The perfusion circuit priming will be with a balanced electrolyte&#xD;
      solution; 1.5% Delflex Peritoneal Dialysis (DPD) solution is preferred. In the absence of&#xD;
      ascites, approximately 3-4 Liters of perfusate is required for the circuit and priming in an&#xD;
      average 70-kg adult. A general guideline is 1.5-2.0 L/m2 perfusate. The perfusate will be&#xD;
      primed, heated to target temperature at the discretion of the operating surgeon and&#xD;
      re-circulated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a patient receives their cytoreductive surgery and HIPEC whether by minimal invasive or&#xD;
      open approach, the biohazardous fluid is collected in the chemotherapy waste containers for&#xD;
      disposal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Placement of inflow and outflow catheters and temperature probes Peritoneal perfusion&#xD;
      catheters and temperature probes will be placed by the operating surgeon in accordance with&#xD;
      standards of practice. Inflow catheter positioning in the sub-diaphragmatic region of the&#xD;
      peritoneal cavity is preferred. Outflow catheter positioning in the pelvis is preferred. This&#xD;
      protocol allows for open delivery of heated chemotherapy at surgeon discretion. Timing of&#xD;
      intestinal reconstruction and formation of stomas will be at surgeon discretion. Sterile pump&#xD;
      lines from the perfusion system will be delivered to the sterile field and the lines will be&#xD;
      filled with perfusate to prevent airlocks. The inflow and outflow tubing will be connected&#xD;
      and the pre-heated perfusate will be allowed to fill the peritoneal cavity. Usually ~3 liters&#xD;
      of solution is required to distend the cavity and achieve desired flow rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recommended anesthetic management and intra-operative physiological monitoring during HIPEC&#xD;
      An epidural catheter may be placed at the discretion of the operating team (anesthesiologist&#xD;
      and surgeon). Broad-spectrum antimicrobial prophylaxis is recommended prior to surgical&#xD;
      incision (specific antibiotic at the discretion of the operating surgeon). Radial arterial&#xD;
      cannulation may be established for arterial-line blood pressure monitoring. A triple lumen&#xD;
      central venous catheter may be placed at the anesthesiologist's discretion. A nasogastric&#xD;
      tude is typically placed to decompress the stomach. A transurethral catheter is placed in the&#xD;
      bladder. During cytoreductive surgery, careful attention to end tidal carbon dioxide, oxygen&#xD;
      saturation and peak airway pressures is made during diaphragmatic stripping assessing for&#xD;
      signs of pneumothorax. The patient's core body temperature may be reduced to 35 degrees&#xD;
      Celsius (95 °F) prior to commencing hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy. At the start&#xD;
      of the hyperthermic chemotherapeutic infusion, the Bair Hugger may be set to blow ambient air&#xD;
      flow over the patient. Adequate intravenous fluid hydration with crystalloid and/or colloid&#xD;
      prior to initiation of the hyperthermic chemotherapeutic perfusion is important, as systemic&#xD;
      vasodilatation occurs during the perfusion. Urinary output during HIPEC should be maintained&#xD;
      at 0.5-1.0 ml/kg/hr. Clotting time and INR, serum electrolytes, blood gases, and vital signs&#xD;
      are monitored throughout the procedure. Standards of anesthetic practice interventions should&#xD;
      occur when clinically appropriate. Fresh frozen plasma is utilized to maintain INR ≤ 1.5 as&#xD;
      appropriate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Heated intraoperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy will be delivered as above. At the&#xD;
           completion of the perfusion, the abdomen will be re-explored, residual fluid aspirated,&#xD;
           bleeding points controlled and reconstructive operation completed if not already done&#xD;
           prior to HIPEC (anastomosis with or without diverting stoma).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mitomycin C will be the agent administered for patients with primary appendiceal and&#xD;
           colorectal cancers at a dose of 30 mg/kg. For rare cases of primary peritoneal&#xD;
           mesothelioma or ovarian primary tumors, Cisplatin ( 50 mg/m2) or Doxorubicin (15 mg/m2)&#xD;
           may be used. This is the current standard of care and is not specific to this trial&#xD;
           protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up visits- A follow up visit after 2 weeks and 6 weeks of the surgery for physical&#xD;
      exam and updated medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then every 3 months (+/- 2 weeks) for the first three year, every 6 months for the next 2&#xD;
      years, and yearly thereafter if no evidence of recurrence. The patient will need the&#xD;
      following tests and procedures during routine follow-up visits. These are part of regular&#xD;
      cancer surveillance and care and are not specific to this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam and updated medical history; Pain assessment; Routine blood tests and study&#xD;
      blood tests; Cross-sectional imaging with CT scan or MRI per standard of care&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patients develop symptoms or exam findings warranting cross-sectional imaging at different&#xD;
      time points, imaging will be performed as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collected includes demographics (age, gender), past medical history, past surgical&#xD;
      history, weight, body mass index, body surface area, ICU length of stay, hospital length of&#xD;
      stay, IV narcotic requirements, time to return of bowel function, need for and duration of&#xD;
      Nasogastric tube (NGT) decompression, diagnosis, surgical procedures performed, HIPEC agents&#xD;
      administered, operative time, estimated blood loss, and postoperative complications will be&#xD;
      recorded. Postoperative complications are defined according to the validated classification&#xD;
      system proposed by Clavien and colleagues.8 Briefly, a complication is defined as any&#xD;
      deviation from the normal postoperative course. Complications are classified according to the&#xD;
      involved organ system and are graded according to the therapy required to treat the&#xD;
      complication. Grade I complications are deviations from the expected / normal course, but do&#xD;
      not require pharmacologic, surgical, endoscopic, or radiological intervention for treatment.&#xD;
      Grade II complications require pharmacologic intervention, including blood transfusion and&#xD;
      total parenteral nutrition. Grade III complications require surgical, endoscopic, or&#xD;
      radiological intervention. Grade IV complications are defined as life-threatening events&#xD;
      requiring intensive care for management. Grade V complication is defined as death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For assessment of oncologic outcomes, patients will be followed with clinic visits every 3&#xD;
      months for the first year, then every 6 months for the next 2 years, and yearly thereafter if&#xD;
      no evidence of recurrence. For patients with recurrent disease, data will be collected on:&#xD;
      site of recurrence, date of recurrence, disease status (no evidence of disease, alive with&#xD;
      disease, died from disease, or died of unknown cause), and length of follow-up will be&#xD;
      recorded. This data will be extracted from the patients' medical records for 5 years from the&#xD;
      time of initial Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval.&#xD;
