    <measure>Mean Change From Screening Visit to MV4 (Week 12) in MDS-UPDRS Part II: Motor Aspects of Experience of Daily Living</measure>
    <time_frame>At Screening Visit and at MV4 (Week 12 of the Maintenance Treatment Phase).</time_frame>
    <description>Part II of the MDS-UPDRS assessed motor experiences of daily living and was self-administered by the patient. The MDS-UPDRS Part II score was calculated as the sum of the individual items of the MDS-UPDRS Part II questionnaire (items 2.1 - 2.13), and was based on 13-items, each anchored with 5 responses: 0 = normal, 1 = slight, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, and 4 = severe. The scale range was from 0 to 52, with a lower score indicating better motor function for daily living and a higher score indicating more severe motor symptoms.&#xD;
The mean change in the MDS-UPDRS Part II score from the screening visit to Week 12 of the Maintenance Treatment Phase is presented. A negative change indicates an improvement.</description>

    <measure>Mean Percentage of Instances Where a Full 'ON' Response Was Achieved at 30 Minutes Post-dose on the Home Dosing Diary Entries During the 2 Days Prior to MV4 - Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>2 days prior to MV4 (Week 12 of the Maintenance Treatment Phase).</time_frame>
    <description>Patients self-administered their doses of randomized study medication in order to treat up to 5 'OFF' episodes per day and recorded the time of self-administration and the 'ON'/'OFF' status at 30 minutes post-dose in a home dosing diary.&#xD;
A full 'ON' response was defined as a period of time where in the judgment of the patient the medication was providing full benefit with regard to mobility, stiffness, slowness and other PD features comparable to or better than that obtained with their standard dose of oral L-dopa and other anti-parkinsonian medications prior to beginning the study.&#xD;
The percentage of instances in which a full 'ON' response was achieved at 30 minutes out of all recorded episodes was calculated and is presented, and the mean percentage is presented.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Screening Visit to MV4 in the Parkinson's Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire (PDQ-39) Summary Index Score</measure>
    <time_frame>At Screening Visit and at MV4 (Week 12 of the Maintenance Treatment Phase).</time_frame>
    <description>The PDQ-39 was self-administered by the patient during screening and at each MV. The PDQ-39 assessed the impact of PD on the quality of life in the preceding month using 39-items, each anchored with 5 responses: Never, Occasionally, Sometimes, Often and Always. Items were grouped into 8 scales (Mobility, Activities of daily living, Emotional well-being, Stigma, Social support, Cognitions, Communication and Bodily discomfort) that were scored by expressing summed item scores as a percentage score ranging between 0 and 100. The PDQ-39 summary index score was derived by the sum of the 8 PDQ-39 scale scores divided by 8, yielding a score between 0 and 100. 0 indicates perfect health and 100 indicates worse health as assessed by the measure. A negative change indicates an improvement.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Patients with Levodopa (L-dopa) responsive idiopathic Parkinson's Disease (PD) complicated by motor fluctuations ('OFF' episodes) were recruited in 33 study sites in the United States and Canada starting June 2015. Study completed in December 2017. Approval was obtained from the Enrollment Adjudication Committee prior to enrollment of each patient.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>The study included a Dose Titration Phase in which individual responses to single doses of APL-130277 (10 - 35 milligram [mg]) were evaluated at 5 mg dose increments to determine the starting dose that achieved a full 'ON' within 45 minutes. Patients were randomized at this dose to APL-130277 or placebo in the 12-week Maintenance Treatment Phase.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>APL-130277 (Titration)</title>
          <description>Patients were titrated to identify the efficacious and tolerable dose of APL-130277.&#xD;
On Titration Visit 1 (TV1), patients presented to the clinic in an 'OFF' state and received 10 mg APL-130277. Patients who responded to 10 mg APL-130277 with a full 'ON' response within 45 minutes of dosing, as assessed by the patient and Investigator, completed the Dose Titration Phase.&#xD;
If a complete 'ON' response was not achieved within 45 minutes of dosing, patients restarted their normal PD medication and returned to the clinic within 3 days for the next TV, to receive the next sequential dose of APL-130277 (15 mg at TV2, 20 mg at TV3, 25 mg at TV4, 30 mg at TV5 and 35 mg at TV6). Patients who achieved a full 'ON' response within 45 minutes at a given dose were randomized to the Maintenance Treatment Phase. Any patients who reached 35 mg at TV6 and did not exhibit a full 'ON' response were discontinued.</description>

Patients returned to the clinic in 4-week intervals for safety and efficacy assessments. Patients completed a dosing diary at home for 2 days prior to the scheduled visit.</description>

        <description>The Motor Function section (Part III) of the MDS-UPDRS was administered by the Investigator, and included 33 scores based on 18-items, each anchored with 5 responses: 0 = normal, 1 = slight, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, and 4 = severe. The scale range was from 0 to 132, with a lower score indicating better motor function and a higher score indicating more severe motor symptoms.&#xD;

        <title>Percentage of Patients With a Patient-related Full 'ON' Response Within 30 Minutes at MV4 - Week 12: Predicted Response Rate</title>
        <description>A full 'ON' response was defined as a period of time where in the judgment of the patient the medication was providing full benefit with regard to mobility, stiffness, slowness and other PD features comparable to or better than that obtained with their standard dose of oral L-dopa and other anti-parkinsonian medications prior to beginning the study. Patients were asked if they attained a full 'ON' state anytime within 30 minutes of dosing. The predicted response rates are presented and were estimated using a generalized linear mixed model.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Screening Visit to MV4 (Week 12) in MDS-UPDRS Part II: Motor Aspects of Experience of Daily Living</title>
        <description>Part II of the MDS-UPDRS assessed motor experiences of daily living and was self-administered by the patient. The MDS-UPDRS Part II score was calculated as the sum of the individual items of the MDS-UPDRS Part II questionnaire (items 2.1 - 2.13), and was based on 13-items, each anchored with 5 responses: 0 = normal, 1 = slight, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, and 4 = severe. The scale range was from 0 to 52, with a lower score indicating better motor function for daily living and a higher score indicating more severe motor symptoms.&#xD;
The mean change in the MDS-UPDRS Part II score from the screening visit to Week 12 of the Maintenance Treatment Phase is presented. A negative change indicates an improvement.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Screening Visit to MV4 in the Parkinson's Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire (PDQ-39) Summary Index Score</title>
        <description>The PDQ-39 was self-administered by the patient during screening and at each MV. The PDQ-39 assessed the impact of PD on the quality of life in the preceding month using 39-items, each anchored with 5 responses: Never, Occasionally, Sometimes, Often and Always. Items were grouped into 8 scales (Mobility, Activities of daily living, Emotional well-being, Stigma, Social support, Cognitions, Communication and Bodily discomfort) that were scored by expressing summed item scores as a percentage score ranging between 0 and 100. The PDQ-39 summary index score was derived by the sum of the 8 PDQ-39 scale scores divided by 8, yielding a score between 0 and 100. 0 indicates perfect health and 100 indicates worse health as assessed by the measure. A negative change indicates an improvement.</description>
