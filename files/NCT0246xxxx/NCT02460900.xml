  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The single greatest health behavior change that could improve cardiovascular morbidity and&#xD;
      associated mortality is to assist people living with HIV/AIDS who smoke to quit. The&#xD;
      investigators will use a factorial design to evaluate the most promising behavioral and&#xD;
      pharmacologic treatments aimed at achieving maximal efficacy for smoking cessation among&#xD;
      people living with HIV/AIDS who smoke. Results of this study will provide crucial, real world&#xD;
      evidence of the best way for healthcare providers to help smokers living with HIV/AIDS quit&#xD;
      smoking.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a factorial design strategy to evaluate the effects, individually&#xD;
      and in combination, of the most promising pharmaco- and behavioral cessation therapies&#xD;
      available for PLWH according to the review of the extant literature for HIV-infected and&#xD;
      general population smokers. The sizable cohort and prospective design will also permit the&#xD;
      investigators to evaluate the effects of tobacco use, treatment, and cessation on a panel of&#xD;
      soluble biomarkers of inflammation that are likely contributors to cardiac morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality in people living with HIV/AIDS. The specific aims of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aim 1: Compare varenicline to placebo on rates of 7-day point prevalence abstinence&#xD;
      (PPA) at 24 weeks in smokers with HIV/AIDS. It is hypothesized that rates of smoking&#xD;
      abstinence at week 24 will be higher in those treated with varenicline compared to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aim 2: Compare Positively Smoke Free to low intensity, brief counseling on rates of&#xD;
      7-day PPA at 24 weeks in smokers with HIV/AIDS. It is hypothesized that rates of smoking&#xD;
      abstinence at week 24 will be higher in those treated with Positively Smoke Free compared to&#xD;
      brief counseling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aim: Compare Positively Smoke Free + varenicline to the other two study conditions&#xD;
      outlined above on rates of 7-day PPA in smokers with HIV/AIDS at 24 weeks. It is hypothesized&#xD;
      that the effect of PSF with varenicline is greater than the effect of PSF or varenicline&#xD;
      alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exporatory Aim: Explore the effect of successful cessation/smoking abstinence on levels of&#xD;
      cardiac specific biomarkers, nicotine biomarkers, generalized markers of inflammation,&#xD;
      lipids, coagulation and monocyte/macrophage activation. The investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      smoking cessation will be associated with significant reductions in levels of these&#xD;
      biomarkers and monocyte/macrophage activation.&#xD;
