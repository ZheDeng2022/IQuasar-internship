  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Young adults who have Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) without co-occurring intellectual&#xD;
      impairment face a fairly unique set of challenges as they transition out of secondary school.&#xD;
      These students are often quite capable of succeeding in higher education and many of them&#xD;
      have interest in pursuing advanced degrees, but the nature of their disability and associated&#xD;
      deficits (e.g., poor time management and poor self-regulation) may impede success.&#xD;
      Individualized, appropriately timed, and developmentally sensitive transition and support&#xD;
      services may promote optimal outcomes for these young people. The goal of this project is to&#xD;
      develop a comprehensive program to promote successful transition of students with ASD from&#xD;
      high school to post-secondary education.&#xD;

      The investigators propose to refine and then evaluate a novel transition support and&#xD;
      intervention program for adolescents and young adults with ASD: STEPS [Stepped Transition in&#xD;
      Education Program for Students with ASD]. By targeting improved self-regulation (SR) and&#xD;
      self-determination (SD) in young people with ASD, the investigators assert that this program&#xD;
      may have positive outcomes with respective to college adjustment and functional behavior.&#xD;
      Although the program will be finalized during the first phase of the proposed project, at&#xD;
      present STEPS is comprised of two levels (or steps), which match the student's particular&#xD;
      needs in relation to transition planning. In Step 1, students facing transition (i.e., have&#xD;
      identified the college they will attend (either 2-year or 4-year institution) but are still&#xD;
      in high school) and their caregivers will receive information to assist in transition&#xD;
      planning, undergo readiness self-assessments (to identify degree of preparedness for&#xD;
      post-secondary school), and participate in interactive sessions online and in person to&#xD;
      promote self-knowledge and determination. The goal of Step 1 is to assist families and&#xD;
      students with transition planning, specifically ensuring that families and students have the&#xD;
      tools needed to make informed choices and take necessary steps (e.g., remediating identified&#xD;
      skill deficits) to increase the likelihood of a successful transition out of high school. In&#xD;
      Step 2, college students with ASD will receive fairly intensive supports and interventions,&#xD;
      including individual counseling, structured support services, social integration activities,&#xD;
      and coaching to promote academic and social success. The following specific aims are&#xD;
      proposed.&#xD;
