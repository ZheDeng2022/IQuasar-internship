    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the efficacy of ponatinib administered in 3&#xD;
      starting doses (45 mg, 30 mg, and 15 mg daily) in participants with CP-CML who are resistant&#xD;
      to prior tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy or have T315I mutation, as measured by &lt;=1 %&#xD;
      Breakpoint Cluster Region-Abelson Transcript Level using International Scale (BCR-ABL1IS) at&#xD;
      12 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is ponatinib. This study will characterize the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of ponatinib over a range of 3 starting doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll 276 participants in 3 cohorts and each cohort will have 92&#xD;
      participants. All the participants will be randomized to receive once-daily oral&#xD;
      administration of 1 of 3 starting doses of ponatinib:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort A: 45 mg ponatinib tablet&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort B: 30 mg ponatinib tablet&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort C: 15 mg ponatinib tablet&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed to consist of 2 periods: 24-cycle Main treatment period and optional&#xD;
      treatment continuation period. Participants will be treated with their randomized dose of&#xD;
      study drug in the Main Treatment Period until the occurrence of at least one of the&#xD;
      following: absence of CHR by 3 months, absence of MCyR at 12 months, absence of &lt;=1%&#xD;
      BCR-ABL1IS at 12 months, loss of &lt;=1% BCR-ABL1IS development of intolerance, or completion of&#xD;
      all 24 cycles of treatment (whichever occurs first). Following completion of the 24-month&#xD;
      main treatment period or following early withdrawal, participants may enter into an optional&#xD;
      treatment continuation period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States, United Kingdom, Republic of&#xD;
      Korea, Spain, France, Taiwan, Australia, Canada, Italy, Chile, Japan, Germany, Argentina,&#xD;
      Poland, Czech Republic, Denmark, Hong Kong, Portugal, Russia, Singapore, Switzerland, and&#xD;
      Sweden. The overall time to participate in this study is approximately 60 months.&#xD;
      Participants will make a final visit to the clinic approximately 30 days after the last dose&#xD;
      of study treatment.&#xD;

        <description>Duration of MMR/MR3 is defined as interval between first assessment at which criteria for MMR are met until earliest date at which loss of MMR occurs, or criteria for progression (progression to AP or BP of CML) are met. Participants remaining in MMR will be censored at last date at which criteria for MMR are met. Loss of MMR is an increase to &gt;0.1% of BCR-ABL1IS. Progression to AP: &gt;= 15% and &lt;30% blasts in peripheral blood or bone marrow or &gt;=20% basophils in peripheral blood or bone marrow or &gt;=30% blasts+promyelocytes in peripheral blood or bone marrow (but &lt;30% blasts) or &lt;100*109 platelets/L in peripheral blood unrelated to therapy or cytogenetic, genetic evidence of clonal evolution, and no extramedullary disease. Progression to BP: &gt;=30% blasts in peripheral blood or bone marrow or extramedullary disease other than hepatosplenomegaly. Kaplan-Meier method was used for analysis of percentage of participants who achieved DOR of 12 and 24 months.</description>

          <description>PFS is defined as the interval between the first dose date of study treatment and the first date at which the criteria for progression are met (progression to the AP or BP of CML), or death due to any cause, censored at the last response assessment. Progression to AP is defined as: &gt;=15% and &lt;30% blasts in peripheral blood or bone marrow or &gt;=20% basophils in peripheral blood or bone marrow or &gt;=30% blasts + promyelocytes in peripheral blood or bone marrow (but &lt;30% blasts) or &lt;100*109 platelets/L in peripheral blood unrelated to therapy or cytogenetic, genetic evidence of clonal evolution, and no extramedullary disease. Progression to BP is defined as: &gt;=30% blasts in peripheral blood or bone marrow or extramedullary disease other than hepatosplenomegaly.</description>
