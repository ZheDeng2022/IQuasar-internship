      Video capsule endoscopy is an important procedure that can be used by doctors to find&#xD;
      abnormalities in the small intestine, especially those that can cause bleeding. The procedure&#xD;
      uses a tiny wireless camera to take pictures of the digestive tract. The camera sits inside a&#xD;
      vitamin-sized capsule that a person can swallow. As the capsule travels through the digestive&#xD;
      tract, the camera takes thousands of pictures that are transmitted to a recorder worn on a&#xD;
      belt around a person's waist or over his/her shoulder. However, abnormalities can be missed&#xD;
      partly because the normal dark liquids present in the intestine can prevent abnormalities&#xD;
      from being recorded, hiding them from the physician who reviews the video.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current method used to clear these dark liquids from your small intestine is to follow a&#xD;
      clear liquid diet and drink approximately 2 quarts of polyethylene glycol (Golytely®) the day&#xD;
      before the video endoscopy and take simethicone (a medication used to treat symptoms of gas&#xD;
      such as uncomfortable or painful pressure, fullness, and bloating) the morning of the test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some of the current preparations to clear these dark liquids are not able to entirely prevent&#xD;
      abnormalities from being missed and most have an unpleasant taste or involve drinking a lot&#xD;
      of fluid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Linaclotide (Linzess®) is a medication approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for&#xD;
      the treatment of constipation and irritable bowel syndrome. It is not approved by the FDA for&#xD;
      use as an aid for clearing dark liquid from the small intestine prior to a video endoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent presentation at a medical meeting proposed using one-dose of linaclotide (Linzess®)&#xD;
      to improve cleansing of the small intestine for capsule endoscopy preparation to supplement&#xD;
      fasting and clear liquid diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This report claimed a noticeably better quality of small intestine cleansing and a 20%&#xD;
      shorter transit time for the capsule by taking one dose of linaclotide one hour before&#xD;
      patients swallowed the video capsule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to assess the use of one dose of linaclotide in terms of the&#xD;
      total time it takes the capsule to move through the small bowel, and image quality as&#xD;
      compared to the current method. The results of this study will be compared to previous&#xD;
      patients who drank the preparation that is currently used&#xD;

      Video capsule endoscopy is an important modality for detection of lesions in the small&#xD;
      intestine. It is particularly helpful in patients with occult sources of gastrointestinal&#xD;
      bleeding, suspected Crohn's disease, ulcerative jejunitis, and in cases where a small&#xD;
      intestinal neoplasm is suspected. Despite advances in technique and equipment, significant&#xD;
      limitations remain in obtaining adequate visualization due to dark bilious fluid that&#xD;
      obscures the mucosa. Furthermore, limitations of battery technology mean that in&#xD;
      approximately 16.5% of studies the capsule will fail to visualize the entire small bowel.&#xD;
      Numerous methods of bowel preparation have been used for capsule endoscopy. To date, all of&#xD;
      them are unpleasant/have significant side effects. This is particularly onerous given that&#xD;
      the majority has already had a similar but more extensive preparation for colonoscopy.&#xD;
      Furthermore, overall efficacy is varied, and the preparation frequently remains suboptimal.&#xD;
      The University of Virginia Health System Motility Lab uses a current regimen of 2000 mL of&#xD;
      golytely and simethicone, but incomplete and partially occluded portions of the small bowel&#xD;
      remain persistent clinical issues. Nearly one in five studies may ultimately have to be&#xD;
      repeated as a result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent presentation by Ira J. Schmelkin, M.D. proposed the use of single-dose linaclotide&#xD;
      for capsule endoscopy preparation to supplement fasting and clear liquid diet. In an&#xD;
      uncontrolled series, he noted a clinically significant improvement in preparation quality and&#xD;
      a 20% shorter transit time (compared with published norms) with one higher range dose of&#xD;
      linaclotide an hour prior to endoscopy. Linaclotide is guanylate cyclase-C that acts on the&#xD;
      luminal surface of the intestinal epithelium thereby stimulating secretion of chloride and&#xD;
      bicarbonate into the intestinal lumen, resulting in increased intestinal fluid and increased&#xD;
      motility. The increased motility and secretion throughout the gastrointestinal tract make it&#xD;
      a potentially useful agent to decrease capsule transit time and decrease the amount of dark&#xD;
      small intestine fluid, thereby improving capsule endoscopy yield. Initial reports suggest&#xD;
      that linoclotide is generally well tolerated, with the primary side effect of diarrhea. The&#xD;
      investigators propose to study the use of a single dose for capsule endoscopy preparation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that single-dose linaclotide will lead to significantly decreased transit&#xD;
      time and improved small bowel visualization quality when compared to controls using&#xD;
      polyethylene glycol and simethicone (standard of care).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to prospectively enroll approximately 30 patients as subjects, who&#xD;
      will receive a single dose of 290mcg one hour prior to capsule endoscopy. This was calculated&#xD;
      using power calculations from values of the Viazis study, who noted an average transit time&#xD;
      of approximately 290 minutes, compared with approximately 190 minutes in the data from&#xD;
      Schmelkin. Given the standard deviation of approximately 90 minutes in Viazis, power&#xD;
      calculation with an alpha of 0.05 and a beta of 0.80 would require 18 subjects per group. The&#xD;
      investigators will target 30 to allow for dropouts and to allow the use of statistics&#xD;
      pertaining to large (approximately 30 and up) numbers of subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All adult patients undergoing capsule endoscopy (with the exception of certain criteria, such&#xD;
      as severe gastroparesis, pregnancy, non-English speaking, prisoners, those unable to give&#xD;
      consent, prior small intestinal resection) will be approached sequentially until completion&#xD;
      of the study. These will be matched 1:1 with historic controls selected at random from cases&#xD;
      in the prior three years. The same exclusion criteria will be applied to both groups. There&#xD;
      will be two primary outcomes: total transit time and rated overall mucosal visualization&#xD;
      (categorized as ideal, good, inadequate or poor/needs repetition). Primary analysis will&#xD;
      presume no confounding and use a t-test and chi-square, respectively. Should the groups prove&#xD;
      significantly different, the investigators also plan to use adjusted analysis. The&#xD;
      investigators will plan to collect BMI, history of reflux, age, sex, gastroparesis, diabetes,&#xD;
      narcotic use, other conditions e.g. Parkinson's, lupus, scleroderma as these may affect&#xD;
      transit time for the historic controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two gastrointestinal fellows or attending level gastroenterologists will perform the scoring&#xD;
      of the images recorded during the capsule endoscopy in a blinded manner. Secondarily, the&#xD;
      investigators will also look at the percentage of capsule endoscopies detecting a culprit&#xD;
      lesion, and the percentage of failed (incomplete) studies.&#xD;
