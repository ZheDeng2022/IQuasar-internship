  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot single arm study with the primary endpoints of feasibility and preliminary&#xD;
      estimates of safety and efficacy. This protocol builds on over 25 years of experience with&#xD;
      high dose liver RT (Radiation Therapy), and in particular adaptive RT aimed at adjusting the&#xD;
      global radiation dose based on a patient's measured sensitivity to treatment. This current&#xD;
      protocol uses functional imaging and specialized radiation planning techniques to spare&#xD;
      highly functional portions of the liver to preserve function. The investigators feel this&#xD;
      will further improve the safety and efficacy of RT for all patients by customizing treatments&#xD;
      to each. If this approach is promising, the investigators will proceed to a phase II&#xD;
      randomized study of standard versus spatially and dosimetrically adapted RT.&#xD;

    <description>The primary efficacy endpoint is local control, measured as the time to progression of the treated lesion. Patients with no evidence of local progression at the time of data analysis will be censored at the last date on which they were evaluated for local progression. Local progression will be summarized with Kaplan-Meier curves and reported with 95% confidence intervals.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have hepatocellular carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have extrahepatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not be eligible for a curative liver resection or have refused resection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have recovered from the acute effects of prior liver-directed therapy&#xD;

             performance status is a measure that attempts to quantify a cancer patients' general&#xD;
             well-being. Scores run from 0 to 5 where 0 denotes normal activity and 5 denotes&#xD;
             death).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be 18 years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have adequate organ function.&#xD;
&#xD;
