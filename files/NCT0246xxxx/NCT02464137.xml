      single-modality phase I dose escalation toxicity study for first-line curative treatment of&#xD;
      head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HYDRA will consist of 5 fraction SBRT treatment targeting only grossly evident disease&#xD;
      localized by examination and standard diagnostic CT, MR, and PET-CT imaging. Prophylactic&#xD;
      coverage of uninvolved at-risk mucosal and nodal drainage basins will be strictly disallowed.&#xD;
      The initial dose cohort will be treated to a total of 42.5 Gy in five equal fractions&#xD;
      delivered every other day over a two week period (biologically equivalent to 66 Gy delivered&#xD;
      in 2 Gy daily fractions), drawn from our successful institutional experience with similar&#xD;
      dosing and fractionation for early-stage larynx SBRT. Escalation of total dose will proceed&#xD;
      in 2.5 Gy increments, up to a final target dose of 50 Gy.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for&#xD;
             the duration of study participation, and for 90 days following completion of therapy.&#xD;
