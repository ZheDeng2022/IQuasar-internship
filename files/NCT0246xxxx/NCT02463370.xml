  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Submucosal resection of the nasal septum (SMR) could be performed under local anesthetic&#xD;
      infiltration performed through ten injections in addition to general anesthesia which was&#xD;
      associated with less postoperative pain and shorter hospital stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the local infiltration technique is time-consuming and requires a large number of&#xD;
      facial injections. This gave rise to the idea of reducing the number of injections while&#xD;
      retaining the effectiveness of the local anesthetic technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Decreasing the number of injections could be achieved by blocking the superior maxillary&#xD;
      nerve (V2) and the infra-orbital nerve since it would result in anesthetizing the surgical&#xD;
      area as well after induction of general anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this prospective double-blind clinical trial was to compare the effectiveness&#xD;
      of four versus ten local anesthetic injections in terms of postoperative pain relief. The&#xD;
      secondary objective was to compare patients' and surgeons' satisfaction between the two&#xD;
      techniques.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Informed consent will be obtained from patients (ASA I and II) scheduled to undergo elective&#xD;
      submucosal resection of the nasal septum between May and November 2015.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sealed envelope technique is used to randomly assign patients into two groups. The&#xD;
      anesthetists, surgeons, and nurses who collected the will be blinded to the study groups.&#xD;
      Patients in both groups will receive general anesthesia and six injections on each side of&#xD;
      the face at the following points: suprazygomatic maxillary (V2) area, infra-orbital area,&#xD;
      supratrochlear area, medial to the medial canthus, nasal still and anterior septum. Group II&#xD;
      patients will receive local anesthetic infiltration in two injections on each side of the&#xD;
      face at the maxillary and infra-orbital areas and the remaining injections are placebo&#xD;
      (saline). Group V patients will receive local anesthesia in five injections on each side of&#xD;
      the face at the infra-orbital area, supratrochlear area, medial to the medial canthus, nasal&#xD;
      still and anterior septum. The remaining maxillary injection is placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To maintain double-blindness, three syringes (one 5 ml and two 10 ml) will be used for the&#xD;
      six injections. They are prepared by a nurse who is not involved in the study. The 5 ml&#xD;
      syringe (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes New Jersey, USA) is labeled &quot;F&quot; indicating that it&#xD;
      should be used at the infra-orbital area for both groups. The total injected solution is&#xD;
      about 2 ml. One of the 10 ml syringes (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes New Jersey, USA) is&#xD;
      labeled &quot;I&quot; indicating that it should be used for infiltration at the supratrochlear area,&#xD;
      medial to the medial canthus, nasal still and anterior septum. The total injected solution is&#xD;
      6 ml. The second 10 ml syringe is labeled &quot;Z&quot; to be used for the suprazygomatic maxillary&#xD;
      nerve block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The syringe labeled &quot;F&quot; always contains the local anesthetic solution. When syringe &quot;I&quot;&#xD;
      contains the anesthetic mixture (group V), then syringe &quot;Z&quot; is placebo. In contrary, when&#xD;
      syringe &quot;Z&quot; contains the anesthetic solution (group II), syringe &quot;I&quot; is placebo. The local&#xD;
      anesthetic mixture is composed of 3 ml lidocaine 2%, 3 ml bupivacaine 0.5%, and 1 ml fentanyl&#xD;
      50 µg/ml. In addition, syringe &quot;F&quot; contains 50 µg clonidine while syringes &quot;I&quot; and &quot;Z&quot; have&#xD;
      100 µg clonidine (when they contain the anesthetic solution).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Suprazygomatic maxillary nerve block technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The needle is inserted perpendicular to the skin and advanced to reach the greater wing of&#xD;
      the sphenoid. The needle is then angulated at 200 and 100 in the anterior and caudal&#xD;
      directions respectively. The needle is advanced about 3-3.5 cm through the pterygopalatine&#xD;
      fossa. The total amount of injected solution is 0.1 ml/kg with a maximum volume of 3.5 ml on&#xD;
      each side of the face.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  General anesthesia technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Induction of general anesthesia is achieved by using 1-2 mg/kg propofol, 1-1.5 µg/kg&#xD;
      intravenous fentanyl and 2-3 ml midazolam. Endotracheal intubation is facilitated by 0.5&#xD;
      mg/kg atracurium. Anesthesia is maintained using 1-1.5% sevoflurane, 0.5-0.75 µg/kg/hr&#xD;
      fentanyl, 70% nitrous oxide and 30% oxygen. Any hemodynamic change of ±25% from pre-induction&#xD;
      values results in a gradual increase or decrease of the sevoflurane concentration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surgical procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following preparation and draping of the nose, the septum is infiltrated using a solution of&#xD;
      xylocaine with 1% adrenaline. This would facilitate vasoconstriction and hydrodissection. A&#xD;
      hemitransfixion incision is made in which the mucoperiosteal and mucoperichondrial flaps are&#xD;
      elevated and then the deviated septum is resected. The flaps are sutured (Vicryl sutures) and&#xD;
      packed with two Merocel packs. The patients will be asked to visit the clinic after 48 hours&#xD;
      to remove the packs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected at predetermined time intervals by trained nurses. Patients will be&#xD;
      followed-up for ten postoperative days and contacted daily through phone calls after hospital&#xD;
      charge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) are collected preoperatively, before&#xD;
      incision and post incision. Monitoring devices are pulse oximeter and noninvasive arterial&#xD;
      blood pressure. Postoperative pain is assessed at rest using the Numeric Rating Scale. The&#xD;
      number of patients who will consume analgesics is recorded. Pain scores, incidence of oozing,&#xD;
      headache, edema, hematoma, toothache, as well as postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) are&#xD;
      collected during the first postoperative day every six hours (at 0, 6 and 12 hours) and after&#xD;
      that once daily for the next nine days. Postoperative oozing is defined as changing three&#xD;
      nasal dressings in 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients' and surgeons' satisfaction will be asked to rate their satisfaction on a four point&#xD;
      scale (very satisfied, satisfied, little satisfied or dissatisfied). Surgeon satisfaction is&#xD;
      based on intraoperative hemodynamic stability of the patient and bleeding. Postoperative&#xD;
      surgeon satisfaction is dependent on patients' feeling of pain (especially upon pack&#xD;
      removal), bleeding and number of phone calls made to the surgeon. Surgeons are asked to&#xD;
      generally recall the number of calls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients' satisfaction is based on their postoperative comfort determined by their feeling of&#xD;
      pain, headache and PONV.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Postoperative pain management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first 6 hours only, 1-1.5 mg/kg intravenous tramadol hydrochloride is given if the&#xD;
      pain score was four or greater. If the score was less than four, patients are given 1 g&#xD;
      intravenous perfalgan. After the first six postoperative hours, patients are given two&#xD;
      tablets 500 mg oral paracetamol if the pain score is less than four. In case paracetamol is&#xD;
      not sufficient, patients are prescribed 100 mg Voltarene, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      drug.&#xD;
