  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out whether a brief course of radiation therapy given to&#xD;
      one area affected by the cancer will improve the chances of responding to immuno-therapy in&#xD;
      the form of a medicine called MPDL3280A, an antibody against PD-L1. PD-L1 is expressed on&#xD;
      lung cancers and is known to block the effects of the body's immune system in attacking the&#xD;
      cancer. Blocking this PD-L1 has been shown to improve the body's immune cells to attack and&#xD;
      kill the cancer cells in non-small cell lung cancer. The goal of this study is to see if&#xD;
      prior treatment with radiation will allow improved recognition of the cancer by the body's&#xD;
      immune cells in the presence of MPDL3280A.&#xD;
