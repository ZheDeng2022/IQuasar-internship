  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chikungunya is a mosquito-borne viral illness that leads to chronic joint pain in&#xD;
      approximately one half of patients. The mechanisms leading to long term arthritis in humans&#xD;
      has not been well established. There is some evidence from animal studies that activated&#xD;
      macrophages with persistent viral infection may play a role in chronic arthritis however&#xD;
      these mechanisms have not yet been identified in humans. It is hypothesized that activated&#xD;
      macrophages harboring persistent active chikungunya virus are responsible for chronic&#xD;
      arthritis and joint pain in patients. The focus of this proposal is to evaluate synovial&#xD;
      fluid and blood for direct viral persistence and activated macrophages that may clarify the&#xD;
      mechanism of inflammatory injury. The results of this study will be directly applicable to&#xD;
      tailoring trials of therapeutics.&#xD;

      Chikungunya is rapidly spreading throughout the Americas and causes debilitating chronic&#xD;
      arthritis in approximately one fourth of patients. There is currently no standard treatment&#xD;
      for chikungunya arthritis, and the mechanisms leading to this chronic arthritis are unclear.&#xD;
      Further characterization of the disease pathophysiology is needed in order to guide&#xD;
      evaluation of potential therapeutics. It is hypothesized that chronic chikungunya arthritis&#xD;
      is due to persistence of active virus in the synovial fluid where macrophages serve as a&#xD;
      viral reservoir. The predominance of activated macrophages in persistently infected tissue&#xD;
      and the presence of viral genome within these macrophages in non-human primates makes our&#xD;
      hypothesis plausible. To test this hypothesis, this study has three Specific Aims. Aim 1,&#xD;
      describe host characteristics affect susceptibility to severe or persistent arthritis. Aim 2,&#xD;
      determine if chikungunya virus persists in synovial fluid and synovial fluid macrophages in&#xD;
      humans as shown in non-human primates. Aim 3, investigate how these macrophages may be&#xD;
      activated and modulated by cytokines. To date, these pathophysiologic factors have not been&#xD;
      well characterized in humans. Information gained from this study can directly lead to&#xD;
      recommendations for the further evaluation of antiviral versus immune modulating medications.&#xD;
