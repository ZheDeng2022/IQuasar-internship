    <textblock>
      A prospective, randomized, controlled study to explore the efficacy and safety of using&#xD;
      either corifollitropin alfa 150 mcg or daily recombinant follicle stimulation hormone (FSH)&#xD;
      300 international unit (IU) for the stimulation treatment of subjects undergoing controlled&#xD;
      ovarian stimulation prior to IVF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed as a non-inferiority trial. The sample size for this trial of 400&#xD;
      subjects, in both groups, being treated for one IVF cycle is based upon the primary endpoint&#xD;
      of the number of oocytes retrieved.&#xD;

      Stimulation regimen and assisted reproductive technology procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Corifollitropin Alfa Group: On day 2 or day 3 of the menstrual cycle, a single subcutaneous&#xD;
      injection of corifollitropin alfa 150 mg/ 0.5 mL is administered (stimulation day 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      FSH Group: Daily subcutaneous injections with recombinant FSH (Follitropin Beta) 300&#xD;
      international units (IU) is started on On day 2 or day 3 of the menstrual cycle (stimulation&#xD;
      day 1) and continue up to and including stimulation day 7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From stimulation day 8 onwards, subjects from both treatment groups will continue with a&#xD;
      daily subcutaneous dose of FSH up to the day before human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)&#xD;
      administration or gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist administration day. The maximum FSH&#xD;
      dose to continue treatment after the first 7 days is 300 IU, but the dose could be reduced&#xD;
      when desired.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To prevent premature luteinizing hormone (LH) surges the gonadotropin releasing hormone&#xD;
      (GnRH) antagonist (ganirelix acetate subcutaneous injection, 0.25 mg/ 0.5 mL) is&#xD;
      administered, starting on stimulation day 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As soon as at least three follicles of 17 mm are observed by ultrasound, hCG or a GnRH&#xD;
      agonist will be used for final oocyte maturation at the same day. hCG is used if 3-18&#xD;
      follicles and 0.2 mg triptorelin is administered if ≥ 19 follicles &gt;11 mm are observed. About&#xD;
      34-36 hours thereafter, oocyte retrieval followed by IVF or intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection&#xD;
      (ICSI) is performed. Three days after oocyte pick-up, 2 to 3 fresh embryos will be&#xD;
      transferred. If patients have high progesterone level on day of trigger (progesterone level &gt;&#xD;
      1,5 ng/ml), risk of OHSS and unfavorable endometrium, fresh transfers will be cancelled and&#xD;
      freeze all will be recommended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients using hCG for final oocyte maturation will receive luteal phase support with&#xD;
      progestogen gel (90 mg once daily) intra-vaginally and estradiol (4 mg/day orally, twice&#xD;
      daily) initiated on the day of oocyte retrieval or the day thereafter. Patients, using GnRH&#xD;
      agonist for triggering, will have fresh transfer with intense luteal phase support of&#xD;
      estradiol and progesterone (receive intense luteal phase support with estradiol and&#xD;
      progesterone as the same dose mentioned above and progesterone 50 mg intramuscular injection&#xD;
      per day).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will return to the clinic for pregnancy test 2 weeks after embryo transfers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Local tolerance parameters (pain, itching, swelling and redness) are assessed by the clinical&#xD;
      staff 30 min after injection for both corifollitropin alfa and FSH injection sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Outcome The primary objective is to show that the corifollitropin alfa regimen, in&#xD;
      terms of the number of oocytes retrieved, is equivalent to the reference treatment&#xD;
      (predefined equivalence range: -3 to +5 oocytes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other clinical parameters will also be evaluated: dose of FSH required, duration of&#xD;
      stimulation, number and size of follicles (≥11mm and ≥14 mm), serum hormone levels,&#xD;
      fertilization rate, number and quality of embryos obtained, implantation rate, miscarriage&#xD;
      rate, and pregnancy rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At least 14 days after embryo transfer, a blood pregnancy test is performed. If the pregnancy&#xD;
      test is positive, vaginal and/or abdominal ultrasonographic investigation is performed&#xD;
      between 35 and 42 days ( 5 to 6 weeks) after embryo transfer to confirm a clinical pregnancy&#xD;
      and at least 70 days (≥ 10 weeks) after embryo transfer to confirm an ongoing pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed to one year after randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All efficacy analyses will be based on the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, which included&#xD;
      all randomized patients who will receive corifollitropin alfa or at least one dose of FSH&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      Occurrence of adverse events, including moderate and severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome&#xD;
      (OHSS), outcome of local tolerance at injection site assessments will be evaluated as safety&#xD;
      endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The percentage of patients with moderate or severe OHSS and local tolerance is compared&#xD;
      between the treatment groups using Fisher's exact test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety analyses will be performed on the all-subjects-treated group, which comprised all the&#xD;
      patients who will receive either corifollitropin alfa or FSH.&#xD;
