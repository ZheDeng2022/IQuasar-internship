    <textblock>
      Background: Taxane plays a key role in the treatment of breast cancer and taxane-induced&#xD;
      peripheral neuropathy (TIPN) is a dose-limiting adverse effect leading to treatment&#xD;
      discontinuation. Ganglioside-monosialic acid (GM1) functions as a neuroprotective factor.&#xD;
      However, the effects of GM1 on TIPN in breast cancer patients remains unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: This randomized phase III trial is designed to evaluate the potential effects of GM1&#xD;
      for preventing TIPN in breast cancer patients.&#xD;

      Introduction： Taxanes is a key agent in the treatment of breast cancer. However, peripheral&#xD;
      neuropathy markedly limits the use of taxanes. Unfortunately, current studies have neither&#xD;
      revealed a clear mechanism nor established an effective treatment for Taxane-induced&#xD;
      peripheral neuropathy (TIPN). Monosialotetrahexosyl ganglioside (GM1) functions as a&#xD;
      neuroprotective factor. This multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was performed&#xD;
      to assess the efficacy of GM1 fo preventing taxanes induced neurotoxicity in operable breast&#xD;
      cancer patients who received taxanes-based adjuvant chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the efficacy of gangliosides in the prevention of neurotoxicity in breast cancer&#xD;
      patients treated with taxane-based chemotherapy. That is, to compare the differences in the&#xD;
      scores of Functional Assessment of Cancer Treatment Neurotoxicity (FACT-Ntx) between the&#xD;
      patients treated by GM1(the treatment group) and the placebo (the control group) at 2 weeks&#xD;
      after completion of 4-cycles of taxane-based chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the differences in the scores of Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group&#xD;
           neuropathy scale between the patients treated by gangliosides (the experimental group)&#xD;
           and the placebo (the control group);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tocompare the incidence of neurotoxic adverse events caused by taxane-based&#xD;
           chemotherapy. That is, the difference between the patients of chemotherapy treated by&#xD;
           gangliosides (the experimental group) and the placebo (the control group) in terms of&#xD;
           the incidence of neurotoxicity (graded according to the NCI-CTCAE version 4.0 grading&#xD;
           scale);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the safety and tolerance of the two treatment groups (ganglioside and placebo&#xD;
           groups).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients with&#xD;
      early-stage breast cancer planning to receive taxane-based adjuvant chemotherapy were&#xD;
      randomly assigned to receive GM1 (80 mg, Day -1 to Day 2) or placebo treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment group: Monosialotetrahexosylganglioside sodium is added into 250 mL of 0.9% sodium&#xD;
      chloride injection, which is given once a day via intravenous drip infusion for 3 days. The&#xD;
      first dose is given at 1 day before the start of the chemotherapy. At the same time, the&#xD;
      patients are treated with a taxane-based chemotherapy selected by the investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Placebo group: Placebo is added into 250 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride injection, which is given&#xD;
      once a day via intravenous drip infusion for 3 days. The first dose is given at 1 day before&#xD;
      the start of the chemotherapy. At the same time, the patients are treated with a taxane-based&#xD;
      chemotherapy selected by the investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The screening and baseline peripheral neurotoxicity assessment was performed 1 day before the&#xD;
      start of the first course of taxane-containing chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will be treated by the study drugs according to the schedule until the&#xD;
      completion of established taxane-based adjuvant chemotherapy, the onset of unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity, or when the patient withdraw from the study voluntarily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoint assessments including FACT-Ntx subscale, CTCAE version 4.0 grading scale and ENS&#xD;
      subscales were performed at 2 weeks after each course of chemotherapy. Additional long-term&#xD;
      assessments were performed at 3 months, 6 months and 1 year after the end of chemotherapy.&#xD;
      The follow-up will be carried out until 2 years after the enrollment time of the last&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;

    <description>The primary endpoint was assessed using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Treatment, Gynecologic Oncology Group Neurotoxicity (FACT -Ntx) subscale at 2 weeks after completion of 4-cycles of taxane-based chemotherapy.&#xD;
FACT-Ntx subscales contains 11 items including numbness, tingling, and discomfort in the hands or feet; difficulty hearing or tinnitus; joint pain or muscle cramps; weakness or fatigue; or trouble walking, buttoning buttons, or feeling small shapes when placed in the hand; feeling pain or hard to breath when exposed to low temperature. Each Items is scored from 0 to 4 with a total score of 44; higher scores indicate better performance.&#xD;
A 5-point difference in the FACT-Ntx subscale scores between groups is considered clinically meaningful.&#xD;
The FACT-Ntx subscales assessments were performed at 2 weeks after each course of chemotherapy. Additional long-term assessments were performed at 3 months, 6 months and 1 year after the end of chemotherapy.</description>
