  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neuromuscular disease that results in rapid decline&#xD;
      in normal muscle function and tone leading to difficulties with mobility, eating, drinking,&#xD;
      breathing, sleeping, and communicating. The disease is progressive and no cure currently&#xD;
      exists. Most people diagnosed with ALS succumb within 3 to 5 years. The only approved&#xD;
      treatment to slow the progression of ALS is called RilutekÂ® (riluzole) which has only a&#xD;
      modest effect and has been shown to increase survival by a few months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Muscular dysfunction present in people with ALS is caused by nerve breakdown and a&#xD;
      dysfunction in the communication between the muscles and the nerves. The area where these&#xD;
      communications occur is called the neuromuscular junction. Some recent studies have focused&#xD;
      on using different medications to enhance communication at the neuromuscular junction with&#xD;
      the goal of improving muscle function as a result. This approach is unproven but may help to&#xD;
      slow the progression of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pimozide is a medication that has been demonstrated to enhance communication at the&#xD;
      neuromuscular junction in fish and mice. This study will look at whether Pimozide may help to&#xD;
      slow the progression of ALS and how much medication needs to be taken to have an effect.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This clinical trial has two components: an acute therapy component consisting of a Phase II&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, double-blinded, randomized-controlled pilot study of pimozide for the&#xD;
      treatment of ALS; and a second component featuring a longitudinal follow-up study on ALS&#xD;
      progression and outcomes. This clinical trial is registry-based including subject recruitment&#xD;
      facilitated by the Canadian Neuromuscular Disease Registry (CNDR; National Principal&#xD;
      Investigator: L. Korngut), and longitudinal follow-up data collection will occur during the&#xD;
      second component of this clinical trial through the CNDR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The acute therapy study duration for each subject is around 11 weeks. The follow up study&#xD;
      duration through the CNDR is up to 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of study participants:25&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: Subjects will be block randomized with a block size of five subjects. Within&#xD;
      each block one subject will be randomly assigned to placebo with the remaining four subjects&#xD;
      randomized to the treatment groups. Study physicians will be blinded to patient randomization&#xD;
      status. Randomization will occur with a 4:1 ratio of study drug (20 subjects) to placebo (5&#xD;
      subjects). After administration of maximum dose for 45-50 days, subjects will taper the&#xD;
      allocated treatment or placebo. Randomization will occur via permuted block randomization and&#xD;
      study personnel will be blinded to the randomization at all times allowing full concealment.&#xD;
