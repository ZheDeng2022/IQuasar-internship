  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      hRPC is a cell therapy for retinitis pigmentosa. This is a first-in-human, dose escalation&#xD;
      study in which participants with retinitis pigmentosa will receive a single subretinal&#xD;
      injection of hRPC cells in one eye to evaluate safety and tolerability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be followed for two years to evaluate the safety and tolerability of hRPC&#xD;
      Additional testing will seek to establish any preliminary efficacy from hRPC.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human open label phase I/II dose-escalation study in which participants&#xD;
      with retinitis pigmentosa will receive a single uni-ocular subretinal implantation of one of&#xD;
      three doses of hRPC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treated eyes will be carefully monitored for any ocular or systemic adverse events for 2&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testing will comprise a series of detailed ophthalmic examinations and imaging together with&#xD;
      blood testing and systemic evaluations, as necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ophthalmic testing will also be evaluated for any preliminary efficacy signal.&#xD;
