  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To increase the potential for timely detection and treatment of cardiac events, hospitals&#xD;
      have implemented a number of different cardio-respiratory monitoring methods for at-risk&#xD;
      patients. The goal of this study is to compare different monitoring methods to determine the&#xD;
      most efficient method to monitor hospitalized patients - the method that will lead to the&#xD;
      quickest response to critical heart rhythms. The investigators will then test the efficiency&#xD;
      of this monitoring method by implementing it in a new patient care unit.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most patients in the hospital who are at lower risk for developing abnormal heart rhythms&#xD;
      have their vitals signs (e.g., heart rate, blood pressure) measured intermittently, such as&#xD;
      every 8 hours. In contrast, hospitalized patients who are at risk for cardiac arrest and&#xD;
      other arrhythmias are put on telemetry to continuously monitor their heart rhythm. A&#xD;
      telemetry monitor is a portable box that is attached to the patient's ECG leads and displays&#xD;
      his or her heart rate and rhythm at a central station. The monitor sends an alarm when it&#xD;
      detects an abnormal rhythm, notifying the person monitoring the patient to check on the&#xD;
      patient. Monitor watchers are dedicated nurses or technicians who monitor a bank of displays&#xD;
      . The watcher-to-patient ratio varies among hospitals, with a single watcher monitoring&#xD;
      between 16 and 72 patients at one time. There are also variations in the additional tasks&#xD;
      assigned to watchers, communication modalities between watchers and nurses (e.g., pagers,&#xD;
      overhead speakers, landline and cell phones, or bi-directional voice communication badges),&#xD;
      and alarm presentation to nurses (e.g., via bedside monitors, centrally located monitors,&#xD;
      automated phone notifications, or none at all, relying on telemetry watchers for&#xD;
      notifications).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A quick and efficient response to cardiac arrest is critical in order to increase the&#xD;
      patient's chance of survival. There is a need for a better understanding of the impact on&#xD;
      monitoring efficiency of factors such as the workload of monitor watchers, communication&#xD;
      methods, and supportive technologies including alarms and automated notification systems. The&#xD;
      objective of the proposed research is to identify and test determinants of efficient cardiac&#xD;
      monitoring methods. There are 3 phases to the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Characterize candidate monitoring methods (Phase 1). The investigators will study usual&#xD;
           care for monitored patients in 6 hospital units. As part of their usual care these units&#xD;
           have different monitoring methods. These methods vary in terms of 1) the location of the&#xD;
           monitor watchers, 2) the means of communicating routine and life-threatening events&#xD;
           (e.g., via pagers), and 3) monitor watchers' patient load and workload. For each of&#xD;
           these 6 units, the investigators will collect data through interviews, observations, and&#xD;
           20 cardiac arrest simulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine which monitoring method leads to consistently rapid response times to lethal&#xD;
           arrhythmias (Phase 2). Using interview, observation, and simulation data collected in&#xD;
           Phase 1, the investigators will develop a computer simulation model of each of the 6&#xD;
           monitoring methods that will allow them to identify the most efficient method.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Test a new monitoring method (Phase 3). In one of the units we had previously conducted&#xD;
           arrhythmia simulations, we will conduct 20 additional simulations after a change from&#xD;
           remote telemetry monitoring to local nurse-based monitoring. We will evaluate whether&#xD;
           response times decrease with the new monitoring method.&#xD;
