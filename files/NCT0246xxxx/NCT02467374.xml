  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out more about how the brain stores emotional learning&#xD;
      in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). In particular, we would like to understand how human&#xD;
      beings learn not to fear. We are also interested in learning about how behavioral therapy&#xD;
      (BT) for OCD affects emotional learning in the brain. We hope this study will help us&#xD;
      understand why people with OCD cannot control unwanted fear and to develop better treatments&#xD;
      for adults with OCD. Patients will be randomly assigned (like the flip of a coin) to receive&#xD;
      12 weeks of BT or 12 weeks of waitlist, followed by 12 weeks of BT. We are seeking&#xD;
      individuals 18-60 with OCD and individuals with no psychiatric history. Participation&#xD;
      includes a diagnostic evaluation, 12 weeks of BT or 12 weeks of waitlist followed by BT,&#xD;
      questionnaires, and up to six (6) MRI scans. You may receive up to $500 for your&#xD;
      participation and reimbursement for parking.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to find out more about how the brain forms and stores emotional&#xD;
      learning. Emotional learning refers to our ability to form an association between sounds or&#xD;
      places with emotional events. In particular, we would like to understand how human beings&#xD;
      learn not to fear and whether individuals with OCD use certain areas of the brain differently&#xD;
      than control individuals. We hope this study will help us understand why people with OCD&#xD;
      cannot control unwanted fear. We are also interested in learning about how behavioral therapy&#xD;
      (BT) for OCD affects emotional learning in the brain. Patients in this study will have an&#xD;
      equal chance of undergoing 12 weeks of BT immediately or being placed on a 12-week&#xD;
      &quot;waitlist,&quot; and then partaking in BT. They will be asked to participate in tasks while in an&#xD;
      MRI that takes pictures of the brain. This study will also use mild, half-second electric&#xD;
      shocks to fingers. The electric current will be generated from a 9V battery (e.g., battery in&#xD;
      a smoke alarm). In order to set the level of the current to be used during the study, we will&#xD;
      begin at a level below what patients will be able to feel, and then increase in gradual steps&#xD;
      with permission. Patients will be asked to stop the increase at a level of the current that&#xD;
      they find highly annoying but not painful. The level of current that patients select during&#xD;
      this trial procedure, and no higher level, will be used during the study so that they will&#xD;
      not receive any painful electric shocks. The purpose of the electric shock is to create a&#xD;
      situation in which emotional learning may occur. Patients will receive no more than ten of&#xD;
      these electric shocks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patients are assigned to immediate BT, participation in this study includes about 20-22&#xD;
      visits to our two clinics at MGH and the Charlestown Navy Yard over the span of 6 months.&#xD;
      This includes an initial assessment visit (2.5-3 hours), 12 therapy visits (each session&#xD;
      lasting 60-90 minutes long), and 1 booster session at the MGH OCD and Related Disorders&#xD;
      Clinic. During the course of therapy, patients will receive weekly practice work between&#xD;
      sessions, which should take around 30 minutes to an hour each day to complete. Additionally,&#xD;
      patients will participate in 3 MRI scanning sessions at the Charlestown Navy Yard Campus: 2&#xD;
      scans over a two-day period during baseline visit, 2 scans over a two-day period during week&#xD;
      4 visit, and 2 scans over a two-day period during 3-month follow-up (week 24) appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patients are assigned to the 12-week waiting period before starting BT, participation will&#xD;
      include about 21 visits to our clinics, including an initial assessment visit (2.5-3 hours),&#xD;
      12 therapy visits (after the waiting period ends), and 1 booster session at the MGH OCD and&#xD;
      Related Disorders Clinic. Patients will be asked to come to the clinic for assessments during&#xD;
      weeks 4 and 6 and after the waiting period (week 12). Patients will also participate in 2 MRI&#xD;
      scanning sessions at the Charlestown Navy Yard Campus: 2 scans over a two-day period during&#xD;
      baseline visit and 2 scans over a two-day period during week 4 visit. Patients may NOT begin&#xD;
      any new therapy or medication while on the waiting list.&#xD;
