      Heart transplants save the lives of nearly 500 children in heart failure per year. Columbia&#xD;
      is one of the largest pediatric heart transplant centers in the world, averaging 25&#xD;
      transplants per year, and providing ongoing care to nearly 250 children with transplanted&#xD;
      hearts. After transplant, children are at increased risk to develop sudden onset of&#xD;
      abnormally fast heart rates. This research project will study adenosine, a medication that is&#xD;
      routinely used to slow fast heart rates in non-transplanted children (i.e. normal hearts),&#xD;
      and its effects on the transplanted heart. Adenosine is often not used in patients with&#xD;
      transplanted hearts because, based on prior limited research in adult patients, the standard&#xD;
      adult dose may have a longer medication effect, producing a slower heart rate for an&#xD;
      undesirable period of time. However, the current alternatives to adenosine treatment are&#xD;
      either inappropriate for the pediatric age range, or have increased risk of unwanted side&#xD;
      effects. This research project will answer two questions: is adenosine safe to give a child&#xD;
      who has had a heart transplant, and will it be effective in treating the fast heart rate?&#xD;
&#xD;
      All pediatric heart transplant patients undergo regular heart testing, known as a cardiac&#xD;
      catheterization, one or more times per year. Three days before testing, participants will be&#xD;
      asked to stop a regular medication, dipyridamole, because it slows the breakdown of adenosine&#xD;
      in the body, and may increase its effects. (Of note, all patients that are on dipyridamole&#xD;
      are also on aspirin, which gives a second line of heart protection, and will not be stopped.)&#xD;
      After regular cardiac catheterization, all patients will already have intravenous (IV) access&#xD;
      to give medication. Also, this setting allows the opportunity to have a back-up pacing&#xD;
      catheter in the heart, ensuring that there will not be a longer than desired effect from the&#xD;
      medication. Adenosine will be given per a low-dose protocol until either the medication&#xD;
      effect is seen or the maximum dose is reached. There will be no difference in procedure&#xD;
      recovery period time, and patients will resume regular home medications after finishing the&#xD;
      test. As Columbia is one of largest pediatric heart transplant centers in the world, studying&#xD;
      the effects of adenosine at low doses will benefit the investigators population greatly,&#xD;
      either to find a new recommended medication dose, or to provide evidence that this medication&#xD;
      is truly inadvisable for the investigators patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial study was completed with all 80 patients enrolled and tested. Subsequent testing&#xD;
      is now ongoing on patients in whom dipyridamole was stopped prior to their initial testing&#xD;
      with a repeat study without discontinuing the dipyridamole. We anticipate re-testing about 30&#xD;
      of the 80 patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After cardiac catheterization, the study protocol will begin with 12.5µg/kg of adenosine (one&#xD;
      eighth the recommended starting clinical dose), and will double to 25µg/kg, 50µg/kg, 100µg/kg&#xD;
      and finally 200µg/kg (not to surpass the total maximum dose of 12mg). A pacing catheter will&#xD;
      be placed within the right ventricle prior to medication administration. Escalating doses&#xD;
      will stop if ventricular pacing is required due to a ventricular pause greater than 12&#xD;
      seconds or if atrioventricular block is demonstrated with a ventricular pause less than 12&#xD;
      seconds. If there is no prolonged pause requiring pacing and no demonstration of medication&#xD;
      effect the subsequent dose will be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Progression to the next dose of the adenosine will depend on both the primary and secondary&#xD;
      study outcomes. If the adenosine dose produces clinically significant bradycardia (&gt; 12&#xD;
      seconds), ventricular pacing will be used to maintain cardiac output, and the dose will be&#xD;
      considered unsafe to use clinically and testing will end for that patient. If the adenosine&#xD;
      dose produces atrioventricular block but with a pause of less than 12 seconds (thus does not&#xD;
      require pacing), the dose will be considered effective and the study will terminate as well.&#xD;
      However, if the adenosine dose does not produce atrioventricular block or require pacing&#xD;
      intervention, the dose will be considered safe but ineffective and the study will progress to&#xD;
      the next higher dose. Before dose progression, the study will pause for additional 30 seconds&#xD;
      to ensure complete adenosine metabolism, as the half-life of adenosine is less than 10&#xD;
      seconds and does not exhibit cumulative effects. The subsequent dose will then be&#xD;
      administered and the ECG observed for clinically significant bradycardia and atrioventricular&#xD;
      block. This will be repeated until clinically significant bradycardia and/or atrioventricular&#xD;
      block is observed, or up to the final 200μg/kg (not to surpass the total maximum of 12mg)&#xD;
      dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same study protocol is being utilized to retest the subset of patients in whom&#xD;
      dipyridamole was discontinued prior to the initial testing to further understand the safety&#xD;
      of administering adenosine to heart transplant patients chronically maintained on&#xD;
      dipyridamole.&#xD;
