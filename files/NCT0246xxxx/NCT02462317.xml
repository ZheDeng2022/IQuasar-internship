    <textblock>
      Stroke is the first cause of motor impairment and disability in adults. Then the main&#xD;
      objective of rehabilitation during the first six months following stroke is to facilitate&#xD;
      motor recovery. Many post-stroke hemiplegics develop spasticity which is responsible for an&#xD;
      increase of disability. Then antispastic drugs are frequently prescribed to the patients even&#xD;
      during the post-stroke recovery phase. Until recently most of french patients were treated by&#xD;
      oral tablets of baclofen. Now the number of patients receiving intramuscular injections of&#xD;
      botulinum A toxin is increasing. However in the literature, these drugs have been tested in&#xD;
      post-stroke spasticity during the chronicle phase, after the sixth month and their action on&#xD;
      motor recovery remain largely unknown. Then it is necessary to evaluate more accurately the&#xD;
      effects of its drugs on motor recovery. The main criterion of its study is the time course of&#xD;
      Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment (FMA). Spastic patients with a single stroke, since less than two&#xD;
      months, will be included in the try. They receive at the same time oral tablets for five&#xD;
      months and intramuscular injections. Patients are randomized in three arms planned with a&#xD;
      distribution balanced by group of 5 patients with a 2 -2- 1 model: botulinum toxin and&#xD;
      placebo baclofen (120 patients), oral baclofen and placebo botulinum toxin (120 patients),&#xD;
      placebo baclofen and placebo botulinum toxin (60 patients). The FMA score will be assessed&#xD;
      before treatment start, one month and three months later. Spasticity, functional abilities,&#xD;
      capacity in the activities of daily life, pain and quality of life will be also assessed&#xD;
      during the study with Tardieu score, Rivermead Motor Assessment scale, Barthel index, Rankin&#xD;
      score, Visual Analogic Scale and Reintegration to Normal Life Index respectively. A positive&#xD;
      difference of 12 points in the time course of FMA in the botulinum toxin group in comparison&#xD;
      with the baclofen group will be considered as the minimum relevant effect. 300 patients have&#xD;
      been planned to be included in 20 centers during the 2 years of trial.&#xD;

      Background: Stroke is the first cause of motor impairment and disability in adults. 80% of&#xD;
      post-stroke survivors have a motor weakness resulting in hemiplegia. Post-stroke patients&#xD;
      partially recover from their motor impairments . These patients reach their maximum motor&#xD;
      score round the first 20 weeks. In all cases, motor recovery period is considered completed&#xD;
      beyond the sixth month. There is a consensus of epidemiological studies and of more&#xD;
      fundamental works on brain plasticity, for the positive effect of rehabilitation on post&#xD;
      stroke motor recovery. Then the main objective of rehabilitation during the first six months&#xD;
      following stroke is to facilitate motor recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are many arguments in animals and humans for the pharmacological modulation of&#xD;
      post-stroke motor recovery. In animals, the experimental data suggesting efficacy of&#xD;
      amphetamine in motor recovery after brain injury, are numerous. The administration of&#xD;
      amphetamine in rats dramatically improves motor recovery after brain injury. This action&#xD;
      appears to be related to the α noradrenergic activity of amphetamines and their properties of&#xD;
      norepinephrine precursor. In contrast molecules that reduce the release of norepinephrine,&#xD;
      which increase its metabolism, or blocking its post-synaptic effects such as gabaergic drugs&#xD;
      or clonidine have a deleterious effect on motor recovery after brain injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In humans, the results of studies concerning the action of amphetamine are much more&#xD;
      contrasted. A study in functional imaging has shown that a single dose of methylphenidate was&#xD;
      able to modulate brain plasticity in post-stroke patients by increasing the activity of&#xD;
      substitute neural networks in the lesioned hemisphere. However, if some clinical studies&#xD;
      confirm the positive result, others at the opposite show no behavioral effect on recovery as&#xD;
      compared to placebo group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In humans, there is also some arguments for the positive effect of serotonin reuptake&#xD;
      inhibitors (SRI) drugs. Functional neuroimaging studies have shown the SRI modulating action&#xD;
      on brain plasticity of sensorimotor cortex. Single dose SRI is responsible for an increase in&#xD;
      neuronal activity of sensorimotor cortex correlated with an improvement in behavioral tests&#xD;
      in healthy subjects as in post-stroke patients. In small clinical trial, Dam et al has shown&#xD;
      a positive effect on motor recovery after prescription of fluoxetine associated with&#xD;
      rehabilitation, irrespective of antidepressant activity of this molecule. A randomized&#xD;
      controlled multicentre trial (FLAME), comparing the effects on post-stroke motor recovery&#xD;
      assessed by the Fugl-Meyer score, of a treatment with fluoxetine or with placebo was&#xD;
      published. This trial confirms the positive effect of fluoxetine on recovery of motor&#xD;
      function in post stroke hemiplegics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding the deleterious drug GABAergic and especially diazepam has been tested in animal&#xD;
      models of recovery after brain injury. The administration of these molecules has a negative&#xD;
      impact on functional recovery. Golsdtein studied the impact on motor recovery of prescription&#xD;
      of GABAergic drugs with benzodiazepine or neuroleptic during the recovery phase of brain&#xD;
      injured patients. It shows that regardless of the indications of drugs there is a negative&#xD;
      effect on the recovery of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conjointly 15% to 40% of post-stroke hemiplegics develop a spasticity which is responsible&#xD;
      for an increase of disability. Spasticity is a symptom characterized by an increase of&#xD;
      resistance to passive mobilization in relation to a post-stroke exaggeration of spinal&#xD;
      reflexes and to a later muscular component. Usual antispastic drugs have an action on the&#xD;
      reflex component and not on the muscular one. Then many physicians want to treat spasticity&#xD;
      early after stroke even during the recovery phase, before development of the muscular&#xD;
      changes. Until recently in France, most of patients were treated by oral tablets of baclofen.&#xD;
      Now the number of patients receiving intramuscular injections of botulinum A toxin is&#xD;
      increasing. However in the literature, these drugs have been tested in post-stroke spasticity&#xD;
      during chronicle phase, after the sixth month and their action on motor recovery remain&#xD;
      largely unknown. Botulinum toxin can increase weakness of injected muscles and baclofen&#xD;
      belongs to the family of gabaergic drugs which have demonstrated a deleterious effect in&#xD;
      animal models of recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Purpose: In the specific population of post-stroke hemiplegics, antispastic drugs should&#xD;
      reduce spasticity while at least respecting functional recovery. Then it study wants to&#xD;
      compare the effect on motor recovery of two usual antispastic treatments administrated before&#xD;
      the end of second month after stroke: botulinum toxin versus oral baclofen. Our hypothesis is&#xD;
      that botulinum toxin is more respectful of motor recovery than Baclofen and may be promotes&#xD;
      the functional recovery.&#xD;
