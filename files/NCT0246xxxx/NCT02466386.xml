    <measure>Change From Baseline in Sleep Patterns Assessed by Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ) at Week 52/ Early Termination (ET)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 52/ET</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep patterns included sleep diary data and children's sleep habits questionnaire (CSHQ), which was parent report questionnaire designed to screen for the most common sleep problems in children, and consisted of 33 items for scoring and several extra items intended to provide administrators with other potentially useful information about respondents. The instrument evaluates the child's sleep based on behavior within 8 different sub scales: bedtime resistance, sleep-onset delay, sleep duration, sleep anxiety, night wakings, parasomnias, sleep-disordered breathing, and daytime sleepiness. Each item receives a score from 1 (problem occurs rarely) to 3 (problem usually occurs); therefore, a higher score is the worse outcome. Scale ranges are as follows: bedtime resistance: 6 to 18, sleep onset delay: 1 to 3, sleep duration: 3 to 9, sleep anxiety: 4 to 12, night walkings: 3 to 9, parasomnias: 7 to 21, sleep-disordered breathing: 3 to 9, and daytime sleepiness: 8 to 24.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Potentially Clinically Significant Changes in Electrocardiogram (ECG) Parameters at Week 52/ Early Termination (ET)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 52/ET</time_frame>
    <description>12-lead ECG was evaluated and recorded. ECG variables included heart rate, PR interval, QRS interval, QT interval, and corrected QT interval (QTc). The QTc was calculated using both Bazett (QTcB=QT/[RR]1/2) and Fridericia (QTcF=QT/[RR]1/3) corrections. Here, &gt; = represents &quot;greater than or equal to&quot;, &lt; represents &quot;lesser than&quot; and &gt; represents &quot;greater than&quot;.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With a Positive Response Using Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) at Week 52/ Early Termination (ET)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 52/ET</time_frame>
    <description>C-SSRS was semi-structured interview that captured the occurrence, severity, and frequency of suicide-related thoughts and behaviors during the assessment period. The interview included definitions and suggested questions to solicit the type of information needed to determine if a suicide-related thought or behavior occurred. The C-SSRS contained 2 required items pertaining to suicidal ideation, 4 required items pertaining to suicidal behavior, and 1 required item pertaining to non-suicidal but self-injurious behavior. In situations where there was a positive response to the screening questions, there were 8 additional suicidal ideation items and 4 additional suicidal behavior items which were completed. Thus, there was a maximum of 19 items to be completed. Here number of participants responded as yes to suicidal ideation or behaviour were reported.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Shift From Baseline in Body Mass Index (BMI) Percentiles at Week 52/Early Termination (ET)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 52/ET</time_frame>
    <description>BMI was derived from height and weight. BMI was normalized by sex and age using the CDC growth charts. BMI percentiles were categorized as: Underweight (BMI &lt; 5th percentile); Healthy weight (BMI 5th percentile up to &lt; 85th percentile); Overweight (BMI 85th percentile &lt; 95th percentile); Obese (BMI &gt;= 95th percentile). Number of participants with shift from baseline in BMI percentile categories at Week 52/ET was reported.</description>

    <measure>Clinical Global Impressions Global Improvement (CGI-I) at Week 52/ Early Termination (ET)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 52/ET</time_frame>
    <description>CGI-I was an overall assessment of global symptom improvement by evaluation of the participant's condition severity and improvement over time. Scoring was done based on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse), where higher score reported worse condition. The scoring was elaborated as: 1=very much improved; 2=much improved; 3=minimally improved; 4=no change; 5=minimally worse; 6=much worse; 7=very much worse.</description>

    <time_frame>Week 52/ET</time_frame>
    <description>ADHD-RS-IV Preschool Version was adapted from the ADHD Rating Scale-IV and provided examples appropriate for the developmental level of preschool children. The ADHD-RS-IV Preschool Version was an 18-item questionnaire that required the respondent to rate the frequency of occurrence of ADHD symptoms as defined by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition-Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) criteria. Each item was scored on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (never or rarely) to 3 (very often) with total scores ranging from 0-54. The 18 items were grouped into 2 subscales: hyperactivity/impulsivity (even numbered items 2-18) and inattentiveness (odd numbered items 1-17).</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>This study was conducted at 32 sites in United States of America from 21 August 2015 (first participant first visit) to 03 January 2020 (last participant last visit).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 113 participants were enrolled and received the treatment. Out of which 69 participants completed the study. Since information from antecedent studies was exploratory in nature and was not really pivotal to the key conclusions of this study, only overall participant data was planned, analyzed and reported to avoid double-counting.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Sleep Patterns Assessed by Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ) at Week 52/ Early Termination (ET)</title>
        <description>Sleep patterns included sleep diary data and children's sleep habits questionnaire (CSHQ), which was parent report questionnaire designed to screen for the most common sleep problems in children, and consisted of 33 items for scoring and several extra items intended to provide administrators with other potentially useful information about respondents. The instrument evaluates the child's sleep based on behavior within 8 different sub scales: bedtime resistance, sleep-onset delay, sleep duration, sleep anxiety, night wakings, parasomnias, sleep-disordered breathing, and daytime sleepiness. Each item receives a score from 1 (problem occurs rarely) to 3 (problem usually occurs); therefore, a higher score is the worse outcome. Scale ranges are as follows: bedtime resistance: 6 to 18, sleep onset delay: 1 to 3, sleep duration: 3 to 9, sleep anxiety: 4 to 12, night walkings: 3 to 9, parasomnias: 7 to 21, sleep-disordered breathing: 3 to 9, and daytime sleepiness: 8 to 24.</description>

        <description>12-lead ECG was evaluated and recorded. ECG variables included heart rate, PR interval, QRS interval, QT interval, and corrected QT interval (QTc). The QTc was calculated using both Bazett (QTcB=QT/[RR]1/2) and Fridericia (QTcF=QT/[RR]1/3) corrections. Here, &gt; = represents &quot;greater than or equal to&quot;, &lt; represents &quot;lesser than&quot; and &gt; represents &quot;greater than&quot;.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With a Positive Response Using Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) at Week 52/ Early Termination (ET)</title>
        <description>C-SSRS was semi-structured interview that captured the occurrence, severity, and frequency of suicide-related thoughts and behaviors during the assessment period. The interview included definitions and suggested questions to solicit the type of information needed to determine if a suicide-related thought or behavior occurred. The C-SSRS contained 2 required items pertaining to suicidal ideation, 4 required items pertaining to suicidal behavior, and 1 required item pertaining to non-suicidal but self-injurious behavior. In situations where there was a positive response to the screening questions, there were 8 additional suicidal ideation items and 4 additional suicidal behavior items which were completed. Thus, there was a maximum of 19 items to be completed. Here number of participants responded as yes to suicidal ideation or behaviour were reported.</description>

        <description>CGI-I was an overall assessment of global symptom improvement by evaluation of the participant's condition severity and improvement over time. Scoring was done based on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse), where higher score reported worse condition. The scoring was elaborated as: 1=very much improved; 2=much improved; 3=minimally improved; 4=no change; 5=minimally worse; 6=much worse; 7=very much worse.</description>

        <description>ADHD-RS-IV Preschool Version was adapted from the ADHD Rating Scale-IV and provided examples appropriate for the developmental level of preschool children. The ADHD-RS-IV Preschool Version was an 18-item questionnaire that required the respondent to rate the frequency of occurrence of ADHD symptoms as defined by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition-Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) criteria. Each item was scored on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (never or rarely) to 3 (very often) with total scores ranging from 0-54. The 18 items were grouped into 2 subscales: hyperactivity/impulsivity (even numbered items 2-18) and inattentiveness (odd numbered items 1-17).</description>
