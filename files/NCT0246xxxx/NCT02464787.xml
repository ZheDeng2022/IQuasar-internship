  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Skin Carotenoid Scores (SCS) are a biomarker of overall antioxidant status. This study&#xD;
      extends an earlier study in which an increase in skin carotenoid scores (SCS) was observed in&#xD;
      subjects who increased their intake of fruits and vegetables. The scores were determined&#xD;
      using the Raman Spectroscopy. In that study subjects were assigned to one of four groups&#xD;
      based on their baseline SCS. For unknown reasons, the groups with the highest and lowest&#xD;
      baseline SCS failed to show an increase whereas the two intermediate groups did. One possible&#xD;
      explanation might be that intakes varied more than expected and was not obvious due to&#xD;
      self-reporting of intake of fruits and vegetables with different contents.&#xD;

      This current project will be an interventional, non-invasive study examining changes in skin&#xD;
      carotenoid levels over time in individuals who increase their carotenoid intake by taking a&#xD;
      dietary supplement containing a known amount of carotenoids. After a two-week control period&#xD;
      eating their normal diet, forty medical students meeting study inclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      asked to take a dietary supplement over an eight week period of time. Students will be given&#xD;
      twin-sachet packets of LifePak Nano supplements containing five capsules (dry ingredients)&#xD;
      and two CR-6 Liponutrient softgel capsules (liquid ingredients, including omega-3 fatty acids&#xD;
      and nanosized carotenoids). These will be taken twice a day with eight ounces of liquid at&#xD;
      the morning and evening meal. SCS will be measured every 2 weeks. At the end of this period,&#xD;
      the students will be asked to discontinue dietary supplement intake and follow their usual&#xD;
      diet for 2 weeks then their SCS measured again.&#xD;

    <description>Skin Carotenoid Scores (SCS) are a biomarker of overall antioxidant status. The purpose of this study is to measure changes in SCS in medical students taking dietary supplements over a 12-week period of time. SCS will measured using a Bio-photonic Scanner. This scanner non-invasively measures carotenoid levels in the skin using optical signals. By placing the palm of the hand in front of a low-energy blue light for less than two minutes, the scanner can determine the SCS.</description>
