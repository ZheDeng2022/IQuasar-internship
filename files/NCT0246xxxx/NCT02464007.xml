  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this EffTox dose escalation study, up to 3 dose levels will be tested. The optimal dose&#xD;
      (OD) of rSIFN-co will be determined using the EffTox design. Additional subject cohorts will&#xD;
      not be enrolled until all subjects at the current dose level complete 28 days without DLT.&#xD;
      The optimal dose (OD) will be determined by evaluation of safety in each cohort and disease&#xD;
      response by RECIST 1.1 at 8 weeks. Once the OD is determined, enrollment will continue until&#xD;
      at least 9 subjects total are accrued at the OD. Pharmacokinetics of rSIFN-co will be&#xD;
      conducted for all tested dose levels to characterize dose proportionality.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The initial cohort will be 3 subjects. Escalation to the next dose will continue unless a&#xD;
      subject experiences a DLT, at which time a cohort will be expanded to up to 6 subjects.&#xD;
      Provided there is only one DLT in that cohort, the dose will be escalated. However, if there&#xD;
      are 2 DLTs in that cohort of up to 6 subjects, previous dose level will be expanded to total&#xD;
      of 9 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If none of the dose levels are acceptable at study completion (i.e., &gt;33% of subjects&#xD;
      experiencing a DLT), an OD will not be identified, and the drug does not warrant further&#xD;
      investigation.&#xD;
