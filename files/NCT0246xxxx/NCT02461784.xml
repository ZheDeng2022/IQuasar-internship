  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal&#xD;
      tract which includes Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) which peak in incidence&#xD;
      (rate or frequency) during the reproductive years. An increasing number of young people will&#xD;
      face challenging decisions regarding medical management of this chronic disease during a&#xD;
      period of time when they are still completing schooling, establishing their career, and/or&#xD;
      are building a family.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment options for IBD consist of immunosuppressive therapy, such as immunomodulators&#xD;
      (azathioprine and methotrexate). Methotrexate (MTX) is a folic acid antagonist (a substance&#xD;
      that interferes with or inhibits the action of another). It is thought that MTX works by&#xD;
      decreasing the inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract. MTX has been studied for many&#xD;
      years and in used as treatment in not only IBD, but also in conditions such as rheumatoid&#xD;
      arthritis and lupus. However, due to concerns about the safety of MTX, particularly in&#xD;
      regards to fertility and pregnancy has limited its current use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are invited to take part in this research project to determine whether the&#xD;
      treatment of IBD patients with MTX is associated with an increased risk for infertility.&#xD;
      Investigators will recruit 75 male IBD patients under MTX treatment for their IBD as well as&#xD;
      75 healthy male controls for a total of 150 patients at the University of Wisconsin Hospital&#xD;
      &amp; Clinics.&#xD;

    <description>The purpose of this study is to determine whether the treatment of IBD patients with MTX is associated with an increased risk for infertility using two different criteria for assessing male fertility: the WHO criteria for basic semen analysis and Fourier Harmonic Amplitudes. The latter will be used to describe nuclear shapes and sperm DNA staining intensity as this has been shown in animal models to correlate with male fertility. MTX-exposed male IBD patients (cases) will be compared with age-matched, non-MTX exposed patients (controls).</description>

    <description>If participants decide to participate in this research they will be asked to complete the informed consent process as well as asked a few questions such as age and race/ethnicity. If participants volunteered for this study because tehy have IBD, investigators will also collect some information from the participants medical record. Completing this portion of participation will take less than 1 hour.&#xD;
Participants will then be scheduled to complete the semen collection at the UW Health Generations Fertility Clinic located at 2365 Deming Way in Middleton, WI. This collection visit will take less than 1 hour to complete. Once participants have finished the collection visit they will have completed their participation in this research project.</description>
