      The goals of this study are to evaluate the efficacy of JNJ-18038683 in an 8 week trial to&#xD;
      ameliorate the cognitive deficit and reduce residual depressive symptoms in 60 stable bipolar&#xD;
      outpatients receiving treatment for depression. JNJ-18038683 will be studied and compared&#xD;
      with placebo as adjunctive treatment to standard pharmacologic treatment for bipolar&#xD;
      disorder.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most, but not all, patients with bipolar disorder (BPD) have clinically significant cognitive&#xD;
      impairment. Impairment is present in both the manic and depressed phases of BPD, as well as&#xD;
      in euthymic periods. The percentage of BPD patients with cognitive impairment (CIBD) varies&#xD;
      among studies, with 40-60% representing the best estimate. The weight of the evidence&#xD;
      supports no overall difference in the type and severity of cognitive impairment in any phase&#xD;
      of BPD, i.e. it is a stable trait feature of BPD, albeit variable from one patient to&#xD;
      another. The most commonly affected cognitive domains are speed of processing, declarative&#xD;
      memory, attention and working memory. Although CIBD is milder in severity than the cognitive&#xD;
      impairment associated with schizophrenia (CIAS), on average, as in schizophrenia, CIBD has a&#xD;
      major impact on function and quality of life in most patients, particularly because the&#xD;
      greater preservation of function of BPD enables them to engage in activities which are more&#xD;
      dependent on intact cognitive function. Thus, it is highly likely that improvement in CIBD&#xD;
      will have valuable clinical benefit, especially with regard to quality of life measures. It&#xD;
      is reasonable to predict that treatments effective to improve CIBD could also be beneficial&#xD;
      for CIAS. Efficacy for cognitive impairment is likely to be greater in BPD than&#xD;
      schizophrenia, because the baseline severity is milder in the former. Despite this strong&#xD;
      rationale for targeting CIBD, there has been minimal focus on clinical trials to improve&#xD;
      CIBD, perhaps because so many resources have been devoted to the effort to treat CIAS, but&#xD;
      lack of appreciation of the severity of CIBD and its importance as a determinant of&#xD;
      functional outcome in BPD may be the most important factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a recent study of CIBD, using the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB), impairment&#xD;
      was found in both treatment resistant BP I and II depressed inpatients within all MCCB&#xD;
      domains. The greatest impairment was evident in speed of processing, declarative memory and&#xD;
      attention. The impairment was numerically greater in BP I than BP II patients but the&#xD;
      difference was not significant. Compared to normal controls, the deficits, in BP 1 patients,&#xD;
      in speed of processing was 1.2SD, in attention, 1.0 SD, and in verbal learning, 1.8 SD. The&#xD;
      least affected domain was visual learning, with a mean deficit of 0.8SD compared to normal&#xD;
      controls. The mean composite score deficit was 1.25 SD. Medication for BPD, particularly mood&#xD;
      stabilizers, may adversely affect some domains of cognition in BPD. However, antidepressant&#xD;
      medications have not been found to affect the severity of cognitive impairment in major&#xD;
      depression or BPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the pre-clinical, pro-cognitive effects of 5-HT7 antagonism in our laboratory, along&#xD;
      with the reported pre-clinical antidepressant effects of JNJ-18038683, we propose to conduct&#xD;
      a randomized, placebo- controlled parallel, design study to assess the effects of&#xD;
      JNJ-18038683 on multiple domains of cognition and mood symptoms. Since our preclinical&#xD;
      studies show that 5-HT7 receptor blockade is highly effective in improving declarative memory&#xD;
      in rodents, the declarative memory measures will be the primary outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the effect of JNJ-18038683 on depressive symptoms in preclinical paradigms, we will&#xD;
      investigate the following in the clinical trial the potential antidepressant effect of&#xD;
      JNJ-18038683 on patients with baseline MADRS score between 8 and 20.&#xD;
