      The hyperghrelinemia of children with PWS provides a unique model by which to explore the&#xD;
      hormonal and metabolic effects of orexigenic hormones in normal and pathologic conditions. An&#xD;
      important question to be addressed by this proposed research includes the macro-nutrient&#xD;
      regulation of ghrelin and PYY in obese children and children with PWS. As ghrelin antagonists&#xD;
      are considered potential future anti-obesity agents, it is essential to gain understanding of&#xD;
      the developmental, nutritional and hormonal regulation of this important orexigenic hormone&#xD;
      in children.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Obesity continues to be a prevalent health concern affecting every race of the American&#xD;
      population. Studies show that obese children are likely to become obese adults. Also, recent&#xD;
      studies report significant years of life lost due to the impact of being an obese adult .&#xD;
      Thus, insights into the pathogenesis of childhood obesity and preventative measures are&#xD;
      needed to combat the inevitable increase in worldwide incidence of obesity and its associated&#xD;
      co-morbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ghrelin is a 28 amino acid acylated peptide which is an endogenous ligand of the growth&#xD;
      hormone secretagogue receptor (GHS-R), a hypothalamic G-protein-coupled receptor.&#xD;
      Enteroendocrine cells (X/A-like cells) of the stomach are the major site of ghrelin&#xD;
      synthesis, although a minor proportion of ghrelin synthesis occurs in other sites such as the&#xD;
      hypothalamus, pituitary, duodenum, jejunum and lung. Secreted in response to meals, ghrelin&#xD;
      stimulates feeding through activation of anabolic neurons in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus&#xD;
      that co-express neuropeptide Y (NPY) and agouti-related protein (Agrp). Ghrelin relays its&#xD;
      information from the GI tract to specific nuclei in the hypothalamus via the gastric afferent&#xD;
      vagal nerve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies in rodents support the premise that ghrelin is involved in energy balance. In humans,&#xD;
      physiological levels of ghrelin influence energy homeostasis in humans.The rise in plasma&#xD;
      ghrelin concentrations during fasting may play a role in meal initiation and body weight&#xD;
      regulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nearly all other forms of obesity are associated with low ghrelin levels. Paradoxically,&#xD;
      researchers discovered that ghrelin levels in adults and children with PWS are 3-5 times&#xD;
      higher than those in age- and BMI-matched controls. Hyperghrelinemia may thus play a causal&#xD;
      role in the hyperphagia and obesity of PWS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hyperghrelinemia of children with PWS provides a unique model by which to explore the&#xD;
      hormonal and metabolic effects of orexigenic hormones in normal and pathologic condtions. An&#xD;
      important question to be addressed by this proposed research includes the macro-nutrient&#xD;
      regulation of ghrelin in normal children and children with PWS. As ghrelin antagonists are&#xD;
      considered potential future anti-obesity agents, it is essential to gain understanding of the&#xD;
      developmental, nutritional and hormonal regulation of this important orexigenic hormone in&#xD;
      children.&#xD;
