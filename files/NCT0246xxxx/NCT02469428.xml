      The purpose of this protocol is to assess whether epigenetic factors in healthy individuals&#xD;
      make a person more or less responsive to lung inflammation following ozone exposures.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Controlled human exposure studies to ozone have reported decreases in lung function (Devlin&#xD;
      et al. 2012; Kim et al. 2011) and increased inflammation (Kim et al. 2011; Koren et al. 1991;&#xD;
      Liu et al. 2009; Romieu et al. 2008). However, the range of response to ozone in healthy&#xD;
      young volunteers is an order of magnitude, and if individuals are exposed to ozone some&#xD;
      months later they retain their hierarchy on the response curve, suggesting that long-lived&#xD;
      factors are responsible. Several studies have demonstrated that polymorphisms in oxidative&#xD;
      stress genes such as GSTM1 or NQO1 may be associated with responsiveness to air pollutants&#xD;
      (Bergamaschi et al. 2001; Corradi et al. 2002). However, within the past decade, many&#xD;
      researchers have started exploring the epigenome as a possible link between exposures to&#xD;
      environmental toxicants and disease. Epigenetics refers to non-genetic mechanisms influencing&#xD;
      gene expression and phenotype (Cortessis et al. 2012). Commonly studied epigenetic changes&#xD;
      include DNA methylation, histone modification, and non-coding RNA expression (i.e.&#xD;
      micro-RNA). Recently, work conducted at the Harvard School of Public Health looked at DNA&#xD;
      methylation as an effect modifier to air pollution-induced adverse health effects (Bind et&#xD;
      al. 2012). This group, using a cohort representing previous war veterans from the VA&#xD;
      Normative Aging Study, observed stronger effects in cardiovascular disease-related blood&#xD;
      biomarkers with DNA methylation status, both globally and within candidate genes.&#xD;
      Additionally, Salam et al. found that fractional exhaled nitric oxide, a marker of lung&#xD;
      inflammation, was interrelated with short-term PM 2.5 concentration as well as NOS2&#xD;
      epigenetic and genetic variations in children (2012). Thus, these studies suggest epigenetic&#xD;
      changes could impact susceptibility to pollutants. Additionally, acute epigenetic changes,&#xD;
      which are potential pathways of air pollution-induced health effects, have been associated&#xD;
      with the inhalation of particulate matter and ambient gaseous pollutants (Baccarelli et al.&#xD;
      2009; Bellavia et al. 2013; Bollati et al. 2010; De Prins et al. 2013; Madrigano et al. 2011;&#xD;
      Tarantini et al. 2009). Therefore, it is possible that an individual's epigenetic profile&#xD;
      could make them more or less responsive to ozone, and that ozone exposure itself could cause&#xD;
      acute changes in the epigenome which could in turn affect ozone-responsiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies that have looked at epigenetic changes associated with air pollutants have&#xD;
      difficultly disentangling the role of genetic and epigenetic factors. One way to do this is&#xD;
      to study identical (MZ) twins. MZ twins arise when two or more daughter cells split from a&#xD;
      single zygote during embryonic development, forming two individuals with identical genetic&#xD;
      sequences (Fraga et al. 2005) but dissimilar epigenomes (Li et al. 2013; Szyf 2007). A number&#xD;
      of diseases in which MZ twins are discordant, such as bipolar and schizophrenia disorders&#xD;
      (Bonsch et al. 2012; Dempster et al. 2011), asthma (Runyon et al. 2012), autism spectrum&#xD;
      disorder (Wong et al. 2013), and breast cancer (Heyn et al. 2013), implicate epigenetic&#xD;
      variability as the cause. Therefore, as discordance for disease status has already been&#xD;
      linked with epigenetic changes, this adds further plausibility to the notion that epigenetics&#xD;
      could be responsible for the susceptibility of some subjects to ozone exposures while others&#xD;
      seem non-responsive. By using MZ twins as one target population for this study, variability&#xD;
      due only to epigenetics, without the influence of genetics, can be fully explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study, the investigators will measure changes in pulmonary inflammation after a&#xD;
      controlled exposure in healthy subjects and healthy twin pairs to clean air and ozone. This&#xD;
      endpoint was chosen because previous work has shown that the epithelial cells lining the&#xD;
      airways are the first target of ozone and respond by making pro-inflammatory cytokines such&#xD;
      as IL-6 and IL-8. Epigenetic changes are dependent on tissue type, and airway epithelial&#xD;
      cells can be obtained by brush biopsies during bronchoscopy and assayed for epigenetic&#xD;
      changes. The investigators will determine whether differences in baseline epigenetic profiles&#xD;
      between subjects are associated with responsiveness to ozone and whether ozone exposure&#xD;
      itself causes acute changes in a subject's epigenome.&#xD;
