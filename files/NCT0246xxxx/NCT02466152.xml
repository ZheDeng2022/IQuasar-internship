  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the systemic exposure and pharmacokinetic parameters of GSK2894512&#xD;
      following twice daily topical administration of 1% and 2% cream in adult subjects with AD,&#xD;
      and will provide information about the systemic safety as well as local safety and&#xD;
      tolerability following twice daily application to up to 35% body surface area (BSA) of&#xD;
      affected skin of subjects with AD. It will be an open-label, sequential study consisting of 2&#xD;
      cohorts. A cohort of 6 subjects (Cohort 1) will apply GSK2894512 (cream, 2%) to affected skin&#xD;
      on an area ranging from 15 to 35% of the total BSA for 20 days plus a final dose on Day 21.&#xD;
      Cohort 2 will consist of 6 subjects that will apply 1% cream. Cohort 2 will follow the same&#xD;
      procedures as Cohort 1.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Between 18 and 65 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Confirmed clinical diagnosis of AD according to established criteria by Hanifin at the&#xD;
             screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of AD of at least 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Atopic dermatitis on 15-35%, of the BSA, (scalp and area around the eyes not included&#xD;
             as treatment area) at baseline. Note: 1% BSA is approximately equal to the surface of&#xD;
             one hand with fingers together (a handprint)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  An IGA of AD score of &gt;=3 at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male: Male subjects with female partners of child bearing potential must comply with&#xD;
             the following contraception requirements from the time of first dose of study&#xD;
             medication until at least five half-lives of study medication after the last dose of&#xD;
             study medication:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Vasectomy with documentation of azoospermia.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Male condom plus partner use of one of the contraceptive options: Contraceptive&#xD;
                  sub-dermal implant that meets the standard operating procedure (SOP)&#xD;
                  effectiveness criteria including a &lt;1% rate of failure per year, as stated in the&#xD;
                  product label; Intrauterine device or intrauterine system that meets the SOP&#xD;
                  effectiveness criteria including a &lt;1% rate of failure per year, as stated in the&#xD;
                  product label; Oral Contraceptive, either combined or progestogen alone,&#xD;
                  Injectable progestogen; Contraceptive vaginal ring; Percutaneous contraceptive&#xD;
                  patches.&#xD;
&#xD;
        These allowed methods of contraception are only effective when used consistently, correctly&#xD;
        and in accordance with the product label. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that&#xD;
        subjects understand how to properly use these methods of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A woman is eligible to participate if she is of non-reproductive potential, defined&#xD;
             as:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Postmenopausal (including all women over 60 years of age).&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Females with one of the following procedures documented and no plans to utilize&#xD;
                  assisted reproductive techniques (e.g., in vitro fertilization or donor embryo&#xD;
                  transfer): Bilateral tubal ligation or salpingectomy; Hysteroscopic tubal&#xD;
                  occlusion procedure with follow-up confirmation of bilateral tubal occlusion;&#xD;
                  Hysterectomy; Bilateral oophorectomy (surgical menopause) Note: A practical&#xD;
                  definition accepts menopause after 1 year without menses with an appropriate&#xD;
                  clinical profile (e.g., age appropriate, &gt;45 years, in the absence of hormone&#xD;
                  replacement therapy [HRT] or medical suppression of the menstrual cycle). In&#xD;
                  questionable cases for women &lt;60 years of age, a blood sample with simultaneous&#xD;
                  follicle stimulating hormone and estradiol falling into the central laboratory's&#xD;
                  postmenopausal reference range is confirmatory. Women &lt;60 years of age who are on&#xD;
                  HRT, wish to continue, and whose menopausal status is in doubt are required to&#xD;
                  use a highly-effective method to avoid pregnancy. Otherwise, they must&#xD;
                  discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status before study&#xD;
                  enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2 to 4 weeks will elapse between&#xD;
                  cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and&#xD;
                  dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of postmenopausal status, HRT may be&#xD;
                  resumed during the study without use of a highly-effective method to avoid&#xD;
                  pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Capable of giving signed informed consent as described in Protocol which includes&#xD;
             compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form and in&#xD;
             protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and bilirubin &gt;1.5x Upper limit of normal (ULN)&#xD;
             (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct&#xD;
             bilirubin &lt;35%) at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities&#xD;
             (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  QTc &gt; 450 milliseconds (msec) or QTc &gt; 480 msec in subjects with Bundle Branch Block.&#xD;
&#xD;
        NOTES: The QTc is the QT interval corrected for heart rate according to Bazett's formula&#xD;
        (QTcB), Fridericia's formula (QTcF), and/or another method, machine-read or manually&#xD;
        over-read. The specific formula that will be used to determine eligibility and&#xD;
        discontinuation for an individual subject should be determined prior to initiation of the&#xD;
        study. In other words, several different formulae cannot be used to calculate the QTc for&#xD;
        an individual subject and then the lowest QTc value used to include or discontinue the&#xD;
        subject from the trial. For purposes of data analysis, QTcB, QTcF, another QT correction&#xD;
        formula, or a composite of available values of QTc will be used as specified in the&#xD;
        Reporting and Analysis Plan (RAP).&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Concurrent conditions and history of other diseases: Immunocompromized (e.g.,&#xD;
             lymphoma, Acquired Immuno Deficiency Syndrome, Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome) or have a&#xD;
             history of malignant disease within 5 years before the baseline visit; Presence at&#xD;
             screening or baseline of an active acute bacterial, fungal or viral skin infection&#xD;
             (e.g., herpes simplex, herpes zoster, chicken pox); Any other concomitant skin&#xD;
             disorder (e.g., generalized erythroderma such as Netherton's Syndrome, or psoriasis),&#xD;
             significant hyperpigmentation, or extensive scarring that in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator may interfere with the evaluation of AD lesions or compromise subject&#xD;
             safety; Clinical signs of infection (viral, fungal or bacterial) on the treatment&#xD;
             areas; Other types of eczema.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Planning to use a sauna during the duration of the study or intending to swim&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a&#xD;
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or Medical&#xD;
             Monitor, contraindicates their participation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), positive hepatitis C antibody test&#xD;
             result at screening or within 3 months prior to first dose of study treatment.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Use of anti-coagulant medication (e.g. heparin, Low Molecular Weight -heparin,&#xD;
             warfarin, anti-platelets [Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and low dose aspirin 81&#xD;
             milligrams will not be considered anti platelets]) or a contraindication to skin&#xD;
             biopsies, a history of hypertrophic scarring or keloid formation in scars or suture&#xD;
