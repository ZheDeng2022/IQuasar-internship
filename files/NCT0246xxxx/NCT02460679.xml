      This is an open label study with 30-day run in phase to establish baseline parameters, 90-day&#xD;
      treatment phase, and a 90-day withdrawal phase to determine long-term effects, duration of&#xD;
      treatment response, and potential effects of EPI-589 therapy on known trajectory.&#xD;

    <measure>Number of Participants With Drug-Related Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0) to Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. Serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. AEs included both SAEs and non-serious AEs. A summary of other non-serious AEs and all SAEs, regardless of causality is located in the 'Reported AE section'.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>ALSFRS-R is a quickly administered (5 minutes) ordinal rating scale that assesses participant's capability and independence in 12 functional activities. All 12 activities, 6 bulbar-respiratory functions, 3 upper extremity functions (writing, cutting food, and dressing), 2 lower-extremity functions (walking and climbing), and 1 other function (turning in bed), are relevant in ALS. Each activity was recorded to the closest approximation from a list of 5 choices, scored 0-4, with the total score ranging from 48 (normal function) to 0 (unable to attempt the task).</description>

          <title>Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) Score</title>
          <description>ALSFRS-R is a quickly administered (5 minutes) ordinal rating scale that assesses participant's capability and independence in 12 functional activities. All 12 activities, 6 bulbar-respiratory functions, 3 upper extremity functions (writing, cutting food, and dressing), 2 lower-extremity functions (walking and climbing), and 1 other function (turning in bed), are relevant in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Each activity was recorded to the closest approximation from a list of 5 choices, scored 0-4, with the total score ranging from 48 (normal function) to 0 (unable to attempt the task).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in ALSFRS-R Total Score at Month 6</title>
        <description>ALSFRS-R is a quickly administered (5 minutes) ordinal rating scale that assesses participant's capability and independence in 12 functional activities. All 12 activities, 6 bulbar-respiratory functions, 3 upper extremity functions (writing, cutting food, and dressing), 2 lower-extremity functions (walking and climbing), and 1 other function (turning in bed), are relevant in ALS. Each activity was recorded to the closest approximation from a list of 5 choices, scored 0-4, with the total score ranging from 48 (normal function) to 0 (unable to attempt the task).</description>
