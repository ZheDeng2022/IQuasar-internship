    <textblock>
      Attention can be defined as the preparedness to rapidly and accurately respond to stimuli&#xD;
      coming from the investigators environment and to effectively select between relevant and&#xD;
      irrelevant information. According to a current model, visual attentional control is based on&#xD;
      two separate groups of brain regions, so called brain networks. These networks control&#xD;
      different attentional aspects (e.g., spatial/non-spatial attention) and they interact with&#xD;
      each other. A disruption of these interactions can lead to attentional disorders such as&#xD;
      hemispatial neglect. Patients with hemispatial neglect have difficulties directing their&#xD;
      attention to the left visual field and they act as though the latter does not exist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, the interactions between the two attentional networks are poorly understood. The aim&#xD;
      of this study consists in further clarifying different aspects of these interactions and&#xD;
      their influence on visual perception in healthy participants and in patients with hemispatial&#xD;
      neglect. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) will be the principal method applied in this&#xD;
      study. TMS is a painless and non-invasive method, with which the activity of brain areas can&#xD;
      be influenced temporarily. This allows us to draw conclusions regarding the functions and&#xD;
      interactions of these brain areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to have a significant impact on the basic understanding of attentional&#xD;
      control in the human brain and it can benefit the comprehension and treatment of attentional&#xD;
      disorders, such as hemispatial neglect.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Attention can be defined as the preparedness to rapidly and accurately respond to stimuli&#xD;
      coming from the investigators environment and to effectively select between relevant and&#xD;
      irrelevant information. Attention is a complex cognitive function based on multiple&#xD;
      components. A recent model postulates that attentional control in the brain is based on two&#xD;
      discrete neural networks. The ventral (temporo-parietal - ventral frontal) network controls&#xD;
      non-spatial aspects of attention, such as alertness and vigilance, and stimulus detection and&#xD;
      reorientation in both hemifields. This network is lateralized towards the right hemisphere&#xD;
      and plays a role as a 'circuit-breaker'. The dorsal (superior parietal - dorsal frontal)&#xD;
      network controls spatial attentional shifts, is largely top-down driven, and substantially&#xD;
      overlaps with eye movement control. This network is not functionally lateralized, each&#xD;
      hemisphere containing dynamic topographical maps of the contralateral space. Moreover, the&#xD;
      dorsal networks of the two hemispheres compete to direct attention to the contralateral&#xD;
      hemispace, thereby exerting reciprocal inhibition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemispatial neglect - the failure to detect, orient, or respond to stimuli located in the&#xD;
      contralesional side of space - has been interpreted in terms of pathological changes in the&#xD;
      interaction between the two attentional networks. Neglect is very common after cerebral&#xD;
      lesions of the right hemisphere, usually affecting the ventral attentional network. The&#xD;
      structurally intact right dorsal network would thus receive a weakened input from the right&#xD;
      ventral network. The ensuing imbalance in the inhibition between the dorsal networks of the&#xD;
      two hemispheres would then result in the rightward bias in attentional allocation, typically&#xD;
      observed in hemispatial neglect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, little is known regarding the interactions between ventral and dorsal attentional&#xD;
      networks and their influence on perception, and the greatest part of the evidence has been&#xD;
      acquired through correlational approaches. The aim of this study is to further elucidate&#xD;
      different aspects of these interactions and to investigate their influence on spatial and&#xD;
      non-spatial attentional performance and on visual perception.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      A first objective consists in further elucidating how and through which anatomical structures&#xD;
      the ventral and the dorsal attentional networks interact. A second objective concerns how the&#xD;
      interplay of dorsal and ventral attentional networks influences visual perception, in&#xD;
      particular in cases in which visual stimuli are ambiguous.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is the principal method applied in this study. TMS is&#xD;
      a non-invasive, painless method which is able to influence cortical areas directing attention&#xD;
      in an interference approach and to thus establish causal relationships. Furthermore, TMS, in&#xD;
      combination with the measurement of motor evoked potentials (MEP), allows for the assessment&#xD;
      of the excitability of cortico-cortical circuits.&#xD;
