      BACKGROUND: Motor symptoms associated with Parkinson's disease may impair one's independence&#xD;
      and ability to perform daily activities consequently decreases quality of life. Hippotherapy&#xD;
      has been shown as an effective treatment to improve function in daily activities and quality&#xD;
      of life in other neurological populations, thus a study was conducted to assess the effects&#xD;
      of hippotherapy in people with Parkinson's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS: Nine volunteers formed the treatment group which participated in a ten-week&#xD;
      hippotherapy program, and nine individuals formed the control group (attended a ten-week&#xD;
      series of lessons on Parkinson's disease). Outcome measures included 30-second chair stand&#xD;
      (as a measure of strength-endurance), gait velocity (during 10m walk test) and health-related&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with motor symptoms such as bradykinesia, rigidity and&#xD;
      postural instability 1 which interfere with the patient's independence, and ability to carry&#xD;
      out activities of daily life 2. In addition, losses in functional may result in a decreased&#xD;
      health-related quality of life (HRQL) 3. Thus, as PD progresses HRQL gets worse 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise programs are suggested to improve functional capacity and HRQL in people with PD 3.&#xD;
      However, in the later stages of PD, mobility problems restrict the potential to participate&#xD;
      in exercise programs, resulting in even greater loss in functional capacity and HRQL.&#xD;
      Furthermore, a decline in the efficacy of pharmacological treatment and complications due to&#xD;
      motor fluctuations and medication side effects make the role of complementary treatments such&#xD;
      as hippotherapy critical to individuals with PD at late stages. Hippotherapy is a therapeutic&#xD;
      intervention commonly used in populations with mobility deficits, since they do not require&#xD;
      effort or walking from patients who can no exercise in standing position. When is on the&#xD;
      horse, the patient exercises as he/she is walking unassisted 5. Neurological conditions are&#xD;
      improved by horse's movement stimulations. The set formed by the patient and his horse&#xD;
      performs rhythmic and three-dimensional oscillations which trigger very important&#xD;
      neuromuscular responses from the rider's postural reflex mechanisms 6. The horse's movements&#xD;
      are sensed by the participant on the saddle, and when the horse is slowly walking it has been&#xD;
      argued to be similar to the pelvic movement produced by human gait, thereby strengthening the&#xD;
      trunk muscles and improving balance 7. The senses are integrated during the act of riding&#xD;
      performing sensory stimulation 8. Furthermore, hippotherapy has been demonstrated to be an&#xD;
      effective method to improve functional capacity by increasing gait velocity in people with&#xD;
      brain disorders 9, functional mobility in elderly 10 and functional strength in people after&#xD;
      stroke 11 and in people with spinal cord injury 5. In addition, hippotherapy has been shown&#xD;
      to improve HRQL in children and in adults 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the potential benefits of hippotherapy to anticipatory postural adjustments and&#xD;
      sensory stimulation 9, 11, it could be hypothesized that hippotherapy may increase functional&#xD;
      capacity and improve HRQL in individuals with PD. This hypothesis has not been tested yet.&#xD;
      Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess the effects of a hippotherapy program on&#xD;
      functional capacity and on HRQL in people with PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (4) Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects People with confirmed diagnosis of PD by medical report were invited through&#xD;
      advertisements on radio, on television, public announcements and posters around the hospitals&#xD;
      to participate in the Physical Activities Program for Persons with Neurodegenerative&#xD;
      Diseases. Among 81 registered volunteers, 18 participants, six women and twelve men, unable&#xD;
      to perform usual physical activity because they were in the late stages according to Hoehn&#xD;
      and Yahr scale (H &amp; Y≥ 3), or because they need to use a wheelchair for severe mobility&#xD;
      problems were enrolled in the hippotherapy program which formed the sample (n=18). Exclusion&#xD;
      criteria were uncontrolled hypertension, unstable cardiovascular disease and had practiced&#xD;
      riding or hippotherapy six months before the intervention period. Among the 18 volunteers&#xD;
      from the sample, three women and six men were randomized for the intervention group called&#xD;
      hippotherapy group (HT) (n=9), which performed ten weeks of hippotherapy sessions (2&#xD;
      familiarization + 8 hippotherapy weeks) twice a week with each session lasting thirty&#xD;
      minutes. Nine other participants who were waiting to be allocated to the hippotherapy program&#xD;
      in the following semester attended lectures on PD, twice a week for ten weeks, with each&#xD;
      session lasting thirty minutes. Demographics and characteristics of the sample can be seen in&#xD;
      Table 1. This study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the University of&#xD;
      Brasilia on 10/10/2013 by the number CAAE 17329213.7.0000.0030. All participants were&#xD;
      informed about the procedures and agreed to participate in the study signing the informed&#xD;
      consent term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instruments Quality of life was measured using the Parkinson's Disease Quality of Life&#xD;
      Questionnaire (PDQL) Brazilian version 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional mobility was evaluated by the Timed Up and Go Test (TUG) according Podsiadlo and&#xD;
      Richardson 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strength endurance was measured using the Thirty-second Chair Stand Test (30CST) according&#xD;
      Gill and McBurney 13.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gait velocity was evaluated using the Ten Meter Walk Test (TMW) according Bohannon, Andrews&#xD;
      and Thomas 14.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All functional tests had three trials with a 2 minutes interval between each trial, and the&#xD;
      average of the two last measurements was used for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hippotherapy Procedures Familiarization sessions were initially 15 minutes and gradually&#xD;
      evolved to 30 minutes in order to allow all participants to adapt to the horse's rhythmic&#xD;
      movements and to the act of mounting the horse. The sessions were performed at the First&#xD;
      Regiment of Cavalry Guard of the Brazilian Army. All practitioners used helmet, shirt, pants&#xD;
      and closed shoes. The team was composed by an auxiliary guide, a physical education teacher&#xD;
      and two auxiliaries. In order to mount and dismount, all participants used a specific ramp&#xD;
      for hippotherapy classes. All horses used saddle and riding equipment, the stirrups were&#xD;
      individually adjusted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sessions began with a 5 minutes warm up that involved stretching and body awareness&#xD;
      exercises. Then, the training was conducted for 20 minutes with arms and torso exercises,&#xD;
      changes of direction called serpentine movements; up and down hip movements with feet on&#xD;
      stirrups, and forced expiration. In the final 5 minutes, exercises for relaxation were&#xD;
      conducted with the horse which involved moving the hand on the horse's neck, laying forward&#xD;
      on the head and stroking the horse. The horses walking speed was between 5.8 and 6.4 Km/h.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to assess the effect of the hippotherapy the difference between post and pre-tests&#xD;
      scores for each dependent measure was calculated (delta (∆)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess whether data had normal distribution the Shapiro-Wilk test was used, which did not&#xD;
      indicate a normal distribution for functional capacity variables. Thus, the Mann-Whitney U&#xD;
      test for independent samples was used in order to compare the changes in functional capacity&#xD;
      between groups. The Shapiro-Wilk test demonstrated a normal distribution for PDQL variables&#xD;
      data, and then parametric statistics was performed with a one-way analysis of variance&#xD;
      (ANOVA). Statistical analysis was performed using the program Statistica 7.0 (StatSoft Inc.,&#xD;
      Tulsa, Oklahoma, USA), adopting a significance level of p≤0.05.&#xD;
