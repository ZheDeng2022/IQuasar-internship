    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of a home-based exercise intervention&#xD;
      on walking ability in people with peripheral artery disease. In 200 patients with peripheral&#xD;
      artery disease (PAD), the investigators are conducting a randomized controlled trial to&#xD;
      determine whether a patient-centered home-based exercise program improves walking ability,&#xD;
      physical activity, mobility, pain, and social functioning, compared to a usual care group.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lower extremity peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a common and chronic condition that&#xD;
      affects 8 million people in the United States. PAD patients have difficulty walking because&#xD;
      cholesterol blockages in their leg arteries prevent adequate oxygen supply to leg muscles&#xD;
      during that activity. PAD patients reduce their physical activity levels and slow their&#xD;
      walking speed to avoid leg pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Few therapies are available to help PAD patients improve their walking limitations. Treadmill&#xD;
      exercise programs that require three or more supervised exercise sessions per week at an&#xD;
      exercise facility can help PAD patients walk with less pain. However, most people with PAD do&#xD;
      not participate in supervised exercise programs because they are not paid for by medical&#xD;
      insurance and the requirements are burdensome for the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have engaged PAD patients and relevant stakeholders to develop a home-based&#xD;
      exercise intervention that is tailored to the needs of the patients. Our home-based exercise&#xD;
      intervention includes a Fitbit activity monitor and a coach who will telephone PAD&#xD;
      participants at regularly scheduled intervals. PAD patients will use the Fitbit to help them&#xD;
      monitor their exercise behavior. The coach will use well-established behavioral methods&#xD;
      during the scheduled telephone calls to help PAD patients adhere to regular walking exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial of 200 patients with PAD to&#xD;
      determine whether our home-based walking exercise program significantly improves walking&#xD;
      performance and other patient-centered outcomes at the nine-month follow-up, compared to&#xD;
      usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PAD patients selected the trial's outcome measures as those that best represent PAD patients'&#xD;
      physical limitations. All outcomes are well-validated and accepted outcome measures. The&#xD;
      primary outcome measure is the six-minute walk test, an objective measure of walking&#xD;
      endurance. Secondary outcomes consist of the Walking Impairment Questionnaire and the PROMIS&#xD;
      questionnaires that assess patient-perceived walking ability, mobility, pain, and social&#xD;
      functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If our home-based exercise intervention is successful, the intervention will have a&#xD;
      substantial impact on the large and growing number of people disabled by PAD.&#xD;

    <description>The home-based exercise intervention focuses on walking exercise and consists of two phases. Phase I (weeks 1-4) consists of four on-site visits to an exercise facility, where participants will meet the telephone coach, learn to use the Fitbit activity monitor, become familiar with the study website, learn behavioral skills necessary for long-term adherence to home-based exercise, and get started on their exercise program. Phase II (weeks 5-36) is entirely home-based and includes a) use of the Fitbit for self-monitoring; and b) regularly scheduled telephone calls from the study telephone coach to monitor and support participants' home exercise activity' c) use of the study website; d) optional group telephone calls.</description>
