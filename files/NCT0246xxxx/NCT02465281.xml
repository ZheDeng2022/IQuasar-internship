      The objective of the preliminary study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To identify correlations between brain lesions and sensorimotor impairments in stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To identify possible patterns between brain lesions and sensorimotor impairments that&#xD;
           might increase our understanding in stroke recovery and guide further tailor-based&#xD;
           neuro-rehabilitation&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to investigate arm and hand function after stroke and how the&#xD;
      location of the brain lesion affects arm and hand function. We are hoping to collect data in&#xD;
      the form of assessments what you feel and how your arm moves, surveys about activities in&#xD;
      daily life and well-being, and we will perform 1 Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan. MRI&#xD;
      scans are loud but painless; nothing is injected. With MRI, we collect images from the brain.&#xD;
