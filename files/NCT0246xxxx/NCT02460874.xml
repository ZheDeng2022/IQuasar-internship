      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pilot Portion: To determine the feasibility and safety of administering oral glyburide to&#xD;
      non-diabetic patients receiving stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for newly diagnosed brain&#xD;
      metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized Portion: To determine the number of patients with newly diagnosed brain metastases&#xD;
      who have an increase in edema as measured on volumetric FLAIR imaging and the number of&#xD;
      patients that require dexamethasone administration (or any corticosteroid administration with&#xD;
      the purpose of treating cerebral edema) from the day of SRS to one month follow-up MRI in the&#xD;
      group receiving glyburide versus placebo.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many patients with cancer that has spread to the brain have side effects caused by swelling&#xD;
      around the tumors. A common treatment for this swelling is a medicine called dexamethasone.&#xD;
      Dexamethasone is a steroid. Long-term use of steroids has several known side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies have shown that a drug commonly used in to control high blood sugar in&#xD;
      diabetes, called glyburide, can decrease brain swelling in patients with brain damage or&#xD;
      stroke. Animal studies have shown that this drug may also reduce swelling from tumors in the&#xD;
      brain. Researchers are interested in whether glyburide could treat brain swelling as well as&#xD;
      dexamethasone with fewer side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is being done to see whether glyburide is safe to be used in patients without&#xD;
      diabetes in combination with receiving SRS for brain metastases. This study will also find&#xD;
      out if glyburide will decrease brain swelling in patients that get radiosurgery (SRS) for&#xD;
      brain metastases. This study will also find out if taking glyburide will decrease the chance&#xD;
      of needing steroids due to brain swelling that is causing symptoms. It is not yet known, but&#xD;
      it is the investigators' hope that glyburide will both decrease brain swelling and lessen the&#xD;
      chance of needing steroids.&#xD;

          -  Subject must have cytologically or histologically confirmed malignancy (this is the&#xD;
             original malignancy, not the brain metastases).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A diagnostic contrast-enhanced MRI of the brain must be performed within 60 days prior&#xD;

             and/or those with renal, hepatic or adrenal insufficiency).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or breast feeding women due potential damage to the fetus&#xD;

          -  Inability to undergo MRI or SRS (e.g. due to safety reasons such as presence of a&#xD;
