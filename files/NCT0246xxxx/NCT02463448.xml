  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open-label, Phase 1, single center study evaluating the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of Autologous Muscle Derived Cells as a treatment for chronic Underactive Bladder.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subject that meet inclusion and exclusion criteria will be consented and enrolled in this&#xD;
      study. Initial screening includes blood and urine testing, questionnaires, physical&#xD;
      examination, specialized bladder function testing and review of medical history. At the next&#xD;
      visit a small sample of each subject's own thigh muscle is obtained by needle biopsy. This&#xD;
      cell biopsy is sent to a specialized lab for growth and processing. Approximately ten weeks&#xD;
      later the frozen cells will be sent back to the treatment site for thawing, diluting and&#xD;
      injection under lighted instrumentation into the subject's bladder wall. The subject will be&#xD;
      followed for 6 months and at that time may be eligible for a second injection of cells. The&#xD;
      study doctor will determine if the second injection may be beneficial to the subject. All&#xD;
      subjects will be followed for up to 12 months. The follow-up assessments at 12 months will&#xD;
      include questionnaires, urine and blood testing, specialized bladder function testing and&#xD;
      visualizing the inside of the bladder with a lighted instrument.&#xD;

    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The efficacy of Autologous Muscle Derived Cells in the treatment of underactive bladder as measured by changes to subject completed GRA questionnaire. The GRA measures the subjects perceived level of change in underactive bladder symptoms at 12 months compared to before they were treated. The scale ranges from: Markedly worse, Moderately worse, Slightly worse, No change, Slightly improved, Moderately improved, to Markedly improved. Subjects select one response.</description>

    <description>The efficacy of Autologous Muscle Derived Cells in the treatment of underactive bladder as measured by changes to subject reported degree of change in urinary symptoms on the PGI-I at 12 months, compared to how their symptoms were before they began the study. Subjects select one response. The response scale ranges from: Very much better, Much better, A little bit better, No change, A little worse, Much worse, Very Much worse.</description>

    <measure>Efficacy of Autologous Muscle Derived Cells in the treatment of Underactive Bladder as measured by changes in the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire (ICIQ) long form.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The efficacy of Autologous Muscle Derived Cells in the treatment of underactive bladder as measured by changes to subject reported urinary symptoms at 12 months from baseline. The ICIQ has a separate female (ICIQ-FLUTS) and male (ICIQ-MLUTS) set of questions to assess urinary symptoms in each sex. For each question the subject completes a degree of bother associated with a particular urinary symptom. The degree of bother ranges from 0 (note at all) to 10 (a great deal). A better outcome is associated with a lower number and a worse outcome is associated with a higher number.</description>

    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The efficacy of Autologous Muscle Derived Cells in the treatment of underactive bladder as measured by subject reported changes to urinary symptoms at 12 months from baseline on the UABQ. The UABQ is a set of questions to assess urinary symptoms associated with underactive bladder. The total score ranges between 0 to 16. A lower score indicates a better outcome. A higher score indicates a worse outcome.</description>

    <measure>Efficacy of Autologous Muscle Derived Cells in the treatment of Underactive Bladder as measured by changes in the voiding habits recorded on the 3-day bladder diary.</measure>

    <description>The efficacy of Autologous Muscle Derived Cells in the treatment of underactive bladder as measured by changes to subject reported voiding habits on the 3-day diary at 12 months compared to baseline. Changes in voiding habits include frequency (total number of voiding occurrences), any reported leakage of urine, total volume voided independently, total volume of urine voided via catheterization). Volumes are measured in milliliters.</description>
