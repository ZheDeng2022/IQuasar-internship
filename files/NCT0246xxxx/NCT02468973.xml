      The challenge of the third millennium doorway medicine is dealing with an epidemic of chronic&#xD;
      diseases caused by unhealthy lifestyle. Medical students spent many hours in acquiring&#xD;
      knowledge in the medical professions but little time invested in studying fields related to&#xD;
      medicine lifestyles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other side, the family doctors in charge of health promotion in the community find&#xD;
      themselves inundated with patients that often can make lifestyle on the one hand but a huge&#xD;
      shortage of time for providing advice and support in favor of this issue on the other.&#xD;

      choose a project support and assistance to the community. Medical students who elected to be&#xD;
      incorporated into this project with the assistance of patients with chronic diseases to&#xD;
      lifestyle changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each student will work closely with a family doctor who finds for patients who need and want&#xD;
      it accompanied by a change he introduced them and guide him on health status, medication and&#xD;
      change the desired objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the program students will receive guidance on healthy lifestyle and support a patient to&#xD;
      perform health changes in theoretical and practical. Training sessions will be held&#xD;
      periodically, close supervision and guidance, counseling and cross-fertilization and updates&#xD;
      from the scientific literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
