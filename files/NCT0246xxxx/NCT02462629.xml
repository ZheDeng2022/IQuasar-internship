  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many types of cancer are primarily treated with surgery and patient survival is directly&#xD;
      related to the extent to which the tumor is able to be removed. It is often difficult for&#xD;
      surgeons to distinguish tumor tissue from normal tissue or to detect tumor cells that have&#xD;
      spread from the original tumor site, resulting in incomplete removal of the tumor and reduced&#xD;
      patient survival. In some sites, such as the brain, it is critical to avoid damage to normal&#xD;
      tissue around the tumor to prevent adverse effects of surgery on function. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that BLZ-100 will improve surgical outcomes by allowing surgeons to visualize the&#xD;
      edges of the tumor and small groups of cancer cells that have spread to other sites in&#xD;
      real-time as they operate. This is a safety study to assess the safety of BLZ-100 in&#xD;
      pediatric patients with central nervous system tumors.&#xD;

      Subjects who provide voluntary written informed consent, or have it provided by their legally&#xD;
      acceptable representative, will be screened for eligibility. Subjects meeting all of the&#xD;
      inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be eligible to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be required to arrive at the hospital for dosing at least 1 hour before the&#xD;
      planned surgical excision. Following dosing, subjects will be monitored for safety and&#xD;
      surgical excision will occur at least 1 hour after study product administration.&#xD;
