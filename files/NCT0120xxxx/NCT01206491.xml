    <textblock>
      Department of Chronic Disease and Health Promotion of World Health Organization listed eight&#xD;
      classes of chronic disease which will be important globally in the future. And the sixth&#xD;
      class is &quot;Chronic Rheumatic Condition&quot;, which includes rheumatic arthritis, osteoarthritis,&#xD;
      osteoporosis, spinal disorders and severe limb trauma. Obviously the osteoporosis is a&#xD;
      globally important health topic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Osteoporosis draws more and more attention, because osteoporosis has various influences, for&#xD;
      example, (1) psychologically impact which occurs frequently in many chronic diseases, such as&#xD;
      depression will appear evidently in patients with osteoporosis (2) patients with osteoporosis&#xD;
      often lose their social role (3) osteoporosis might induce pain and limitation of body&#xD;
      function (4) osteoporosis increases greatly the possibility of fracture. Osteoporosis will&#xD;
      induce adverse outcomes, such as the fall of life quality, the increase of morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality, as well as the increased abuse of medical service. In this project, the&#xD;
      investigators will set up the intervention model for prevention of osteoporosis as well as&#xD;
      falls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this project, the investigators will recruit patients form outpatient services at WanFang&#xD;
      Hospital. Through the collection of baseline data from questionnaire and bone density&#xD;
      measurement, the investigators can clarify the risk of osteoporosis and falls in studied&#xD;
      patients. By using double-blind randomized design, the patients will be collected to either&#xD;
      one of intervention and control group. After eight weeks of intervention programs, the&#xD;
      investigators will follow on both groups to understand the effect of this program and to&#xD;
      increase the bone density of intervention group. The hospital or the Health center might take&#xD;
      the outcome to be the reference of taking care the Osteoporosis.&#xD;
