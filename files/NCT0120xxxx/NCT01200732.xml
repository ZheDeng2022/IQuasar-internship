  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A preliminary observational study by the investigators has shown that tadalafil, a selective&#xD;
      phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor (PDE-5) decreases pulmonary vascular resistance(PVR) in&#xD;
      patients of eisenmenger syndrome (ES) resulting in increase in pulmonary blood flow (Qp),&#xD;
      systemic oxygen saturation (SaO2), functional class and exercise capacity. The aim of this&#xD;
      placebo controlled trial was to assess the effect of the drug on exercise capacity and&#xD;
      functional class compared to placebo.&#xD;

      Methods Patients of ES with age greater than or equal to 18 years and weight greater than or&#xD;
      equal to 30 kgs in World Health Organisation (WHO) functional class II and III attending our&#xD;
      congenital clinic were invited to participate in the study. Informed written consent was&#xD;
      taken from all the patients before screening procedures were initiated for the study. A&#xD;
      detailed clinical examination and non-invasive testing including electrocardiogram, chest X&#xD;
      ray, pulmonary function tests (to exclude associated restrictive/obstructive lung disease)&#xD;
      and echocardiography(including contrast echo if required for demonstrating right to left&#xD;
      shunt) were conducted. Patients with simple congenital heart defects (atrial septal defect &gt;&#xD;
      2cm, ventricular septal defect &gt; 1cm and aortopulmonary communications &gt; 0.4 cm) with&#xD;
      echocardiographic evidence of right to left shunt were included. Medical therapy and clinical&#xD;
      condition of the patients had to be stable for 3 months prior to screening. Patients on&#xD;
      treatment with prostanoids, endothelial receptor antagonists (ERA), PDE-5 inhibitors or any&#xD;
      other vasodilators with in 1month prior to screening were excluded. A systemic pulse oximetry&#xD;
      (SpO2) between 70% and 90% at rest in room air and a baseline 6 minute walk test(6MWT)&#xD;
      distance between 150 and 450 meters were required for inclusion. Eisenmenger physiology was&#xD;
      confirmed by cardiac catheterization as mean pulmonary artery pressure &gt; 40mmHg, pulmonary&#xD;
      capillary wedge pressure &lt; 15mmHg and pulmonary vascular resistance &gt;10 wood units/m2. Oxygen&#xD;
      study was also done in selected patients to diagnose reversible pulmonary arterial&#xD;
      hypertension(PAH) and such patients were excluded. Patients were also excluded if they were&#xD;
      in WHO class IV, were in congestive heart failure or had PCWP &gt; 15mmHg,had left ventricular&#xD;
      ejection fraction &lt;40%, atrial fibrillation, patent ductus arteriosus, complex congenital&#xD;
      heart defects, restrictive lung disease(total lung capacity &lt; 70% of predicted), obstructive&#xD;
      lung disease ( forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1] &lt; 70% of predicted with FEV1/&#xD;
      Forced vital capacity [FVC] &lt; 60%), previously diagnosed coronary artery disease requiring&#xD;
      nitrate therapy, abnormal biochemical profile and hypersensitivity to PDE- 5 inhibitors. Left&#xD;
      and right heart catheterization was done in eligible patients as described in our preliminary&#xD;
      observational study. Calculation of pulmonary and systemic blood flow(Qs), PVR and SVR was&#xD;
      performed using the Ficks equation and assumed values of oxygen consumption according to age&#xD;
      and gender of patient. The study was conducted according to the most recent amendments to the&#xD;
      Declaration of Helsinki and in adherence to good clinical practice guidelines. The trial was&#xD;
      approved by the National Drug Regulatory Authority (DCG) and the ethical committee of our&#xD;
      institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design and procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A double blind randomised placebo controlled crossover trial was carried out to study the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of oral tadalafil. Eligible patients were randomised to receive either&#xD;
      oral tadalafil or matching placebo after baseline assessment of WHO functional class,&#xD;
      exercise capacity by 6MWT and hemodynamic study by cardiac catheterization. Randomisation,&#xD;
      blinding and drug/placebo administration was done by two pharmacists of the hospital.&#xD;
      Patients received tadalafil 40mg once daily or matching placebo for 6 weeks which was&#xD;
      followed by a 2 week washout before crossing over to the other drug for another 6 weeks.&#xD;
      Routine medications for PAH like digoxin and diuretics was continued through out the study.&#xD;
      Compliance was assessed by the pill count method at 3 weekly intervals. Safety of the drug or&#xD;
      placebo was assessed by noting adverse effects, vital signs and (SaO2) by pulse oximetry at 3&#xD;
      week intervals. Clinical assessments (WHO functional class), 6 MWT and hemodynamic parameters&#xD;
      by cardiac catheterization were reassessed after 6 weeks and again at the end of the study.&#xD;
