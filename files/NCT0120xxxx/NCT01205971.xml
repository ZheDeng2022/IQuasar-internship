  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dental caries is the most common chronic disease of childhood and is increasing in prevalence&#xD;
      in children 2-5 years old. Racial and ethnic minority groups as well as economically&#xD;
      disadvantaged individuals are affected the most by this health outcome. This study will test&#xD;
      if a community-based multimodal intervention will reduce 2-year incidence of early childhood&#xD;
      caries (ECC) in children aged 0-5 living in public housing developments. The intervention&#xD;
      combines the components of motivational interviewing (counseling) delivered by dental health&#xD;
      advocates, fluoride varnish application, oral health assessment and referral. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that the multimodal intervention with motivational interviewing&#xD;
      will reduce ECC behavioral risk factors thereby leading to a reduction of ECC incidence when&#xD;
      compared to fluoride varnish application, written oral health education materials and oral&#xD;
      health assessment and referral.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Dental caries is the most common, chronic disease of childhood, is increasing in prevalence,&#xD;
      and disproportionately affects individuals who are financially disadvantaged and from racial&#xD;
      and ethnic minority groups. Given the chronic nature of dental caries, clinically based&#xD;
      preventive and restorative care alone will likely be inadequate to decrease disparities in&#xD;
      early childhood caries (ECC) prevalence. We posit that a multimodal community-based approach,&#xD;
      which addresses the chronic, infectious and multifactorial nature of dental caries, will be&#xD;
      more effective than either behavioral counseling and the chemotherapeutic effects of fluoride&#xD;
      alone. In addition to counseling and fluoride application, a successful community-based&#xD;
      multimodal intervention will also need to equip caregivers with the skills to become involved&#xD;
      in the prevention and management of ECC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This group randomized clinical trial will test if a community-based multimodal intervention&#xD;
      will reduce the 2-year ECC incidence of children aged 0-5 living in public housing&#xD;
      developments. The intervention combines evidence based components and a unique delivery&#xD;
      setting (public housing). We hypothesize that the multimodal intervention comprised of oral&#xD;
      health assessment and feedback, fluoride varnish application, and motivational interviewing&#xD;
      delivered by Dental Health Advocates (trained public housing residents) can reduce incidence&#xD;
      of ECC in 0-5 year olds compared with a control group that receives oral health assessment&#xD;
      and feedback, fluoride varnish application, and written oral health education materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is well poised for dissemination. Ultimately, this work could be disseminated&#xD;
      nationwide and could potentially improve the oral health of over 500,000 family households&#xD;
      and over 1 million children living in public housing.&#xD;
