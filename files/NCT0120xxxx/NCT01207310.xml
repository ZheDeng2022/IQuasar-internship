    <textblock>
      The proposed study tests the efficacy of using pager-assisted messages combined with nicotine&#xD;
      patches in facilitating smoking cessation and relapse prevention in a 2-arm randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial. The hypothesis is that the proportion of biochemically-verified quitters at 3&#xD;
      and 12 months in the study arm randomized to receive therapeutic messages on alphanumeric&#xD;
      pagers for 3 months along with individual smoking cessation counseling and nicotine patches&#xD;
      will be greater that the proportion of biochemically-verified quitters who receive only&#xD;
      individual smoking cessation counseling and nicotine patches.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 224 current smokers were enrolled in a randomized controlled smoking cessation&#xD;
      trial. Participants were community-living adult smokers of â‰¥10 cigarettes per day during the&#xD;
      pre-enrollment week who were interested in quitting and recruited from the local area by&#xD;
      means of print, media, and online advertisements. To be eligible, they needed to be smoking&#xD;
      10 or more cigarettes per day, aged 18 or older, motivated to quit smoking, prepared to set a&#xD;
      quit date, willing to use nicotine patches, and able to come to therapy sessions and be&#xD;
      followed by telephone. Participants in the pager treatment were provided with alpha-numeric&#xD;
      pagers free of charge for three months. Using specially-designed communication software, text&#xD;
      messages were sent to participants aimed at facilitating motivation to quit, cessation&#xD;
      strategies, and coping skills to maintain abstinence. Participants in both treatment groups&#xD;
      were seen for two 60-minute sessions of standard smoking cessation counseling, and received&#xD;
      three follow-up phone calls and two months of nicotine patches.&#xD;
