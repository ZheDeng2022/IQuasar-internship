    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of the&#xD;
      combination of Grifola frondosa extract, azacitidine, and lenalidomide that can be given to&#xD;
      patients with advanced cancer. The safety of this drug combination will also be studied.&#xD;

      Study Drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Azacitidine is designed to block certain proteins in cancer cells whose job is to stop the&#xD;
      function of the tumor-fighting proteins. By blocking the &quot;bad&quot; proteins, the tumor-fighting&#xD;
      genes may be able to work better.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lenalidomide is designed to change the body's immune system. It may also interfere with the&#xD;
      development of tiny blood vessels that help support tumor growth. This may decrease the&#xD;
      growth of cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Grifola frondosa extract is a natural substance taken from maitake mushrooms. Researchers&#xD;
      want to learn if it can cause the body's immune system to react against cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to receive&#xD;
      either azacitidine and lenalidomide, azacitidine and Grifola frondosa, or azacitidine,&#xD;
      lenalidomide, and Grifola frondosa at a dose level based on when you joined this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 4 dose levels of azacitidine and lenalidomide will be tested. Up to 2 dose levels of&#xD;
      azacitidine and Grifola frondosa will be tested. At the beginning of the study, 3-6&#xD;
      participants will be enrolled at each dose level of the study drug combinations. The first&#xD;
      group of participants will receive the lowest dose level of azacitidine and lenalidomide.&#xD;
      Each new group will receive a higher dose of the study drug combination than the group before&#xD;
      it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. This will continue until the highest tolerable&#xD;
      dose of the study drug combination is found. After enrollment in the azacitidine and&#xD;
      lenalidomide group is completed, the next group of participants will receive the lowest dose&#xD;
      level of azacitidine and Grifola frondosa. Each new group will receive a higher dose of the&#xD;
      study drug combination than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen.&#xD;
      This will continue until the highest tolerable dose of the study drug combination is found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the highest dose of the azacitidine and lenalidomide or Grifola frondosa combinations&#xD;
      are found, new participants enrolling in this study will begin receiving Grifola frondosa&#xD;
      along with azacitidine and lenalidomide. Up to 2 dose levels will be tested. The first group&#xD;
      of participants will receive the lowest dose level of lenalidomide. The next group will&#xD;
      receive a higher dose of lenalidomide than the group before it, if no intolerable side&#xD;
      effects were seen. The doses of azacitidine and Grifola frondosa will stay the same.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose of the study drug combination that you receive may be lowered if you have any&#xD;
      intolerable side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study drug &quot;cycle&quot; is 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 1-5 of each Cycle, you will receive azacitidine either under the skin or by vein. If&#xD;
      you receive azacitidine as an injection under the skin, you will receive it over 10 minutes.&#xD;
      If you receive azacitidine by vein, you will receive it over 40 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 2 of Cycle 1, you will begin taking lenalidomide 1 time each day until Day 21, then&#xD;
      you will have a 7 day-rest period. For Cycle 2 and every cycle after that, you will take&#xD;
      lenalidomide 1 time each day on Days 1-21 followed by a 7-day rest period. Lenalidomide is a&#xD;
      capsule that you will take by mouth with water. The capsules should be swallowed whole. You&#xD;
      should not break, chew, or open the capsules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are assigned to receive Grifola frondosa, you will also begin taking Grifola frondosa&#xD;
      2 times each day on Day 2 of Cycle 1 if you are also taking azacitidine. If you are also&#xD;
      taking azacitidine and lenalidomide, you will begin taking Grifola frondosa on Day 3 of Cycle&#xD;
      1. Depending on the dose level you are assigned to, you will either take Grifola frondosa 2&#xD;
      times each day until Day 21 followed by a 7-day rest period, or you will take Grifola&#xD;
      frondosa 2 times daily during all cycles. Grifola frondosa is a liquid extract that comes in&#xD;
      a glass bottle. Your dose of Grifola frondosa will be based on when you joined the study and&#xD;
      your body weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expansion Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the highest tolerable dose of each study drug combination is found, 42 additional&#xD;
      participants will be enrolled in 3 expansion groups (14 in each group), one group for each&#xD;
      study drug combination at the highest tolerable dose or a dose level that has been shown to&#xD;
      be safe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following tests and procedures will be performed within 7 days before your first dose of&#xD;
      study drug:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women who are able to have children must have a negative blood (about 1 teaspoon) pregnancy&#xD;
      test within 10 to 14 days before the first dose of the study drug combination and again&#xD;
      within 24 hours before receiving lenalidomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before you begin each cycle, the following tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any side effects you may be having.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the study doctor thinks it is needed, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to&#xD;
           measure tumor markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women who are able to have children will have a blood pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every week during Cycles 1 and 2, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women who are able to have children will have a blood (about 1 teaspoon) pregnancy test every&#xD;
      week during Cycle 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of every 2 cycles (Cycles 2, 4, 6, and so on), you will have a CT, MRI, PET scan,&#xD;
      and/or x-ray to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in the one of the Expansion Groups, blood (about 6 teaspoons each time) will be&#xD;
      drawn for biomarker testing before you take the first dose of study drug, on Days 21 and 28&#xD;
      of Cycle 1, 1 time during each cycle after that, and at the end-of-study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may continue taking the study drugs for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best&#xD;
      interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse or&#xD;
      intolerable side effects occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Study Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 30 days after your last dose of the study drug combination, you will have an&#xD;
      end-of-study visit. The following tests and procedures performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any side effects you may be having.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the study doctor thinks it is needed, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to&#xD;
           measure tumor markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the study doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a chest x-ray, CT, MRI, and/or&#xD;
           PET scan to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women who are able to have children will have a blood pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Grifola frondosa extract is not FDA approved for any usage.&#xD;
      Its use in this study is investigational. Azacitidine and lenalidomide are FDA approved and&#xD;
      commercially available for the treatment of multiple myeloma and myelodysplastic syndrome.&#xD;
      The use of the study drug combination (Grifola frondosa, azacitidine, and lenalidomide) is&#xD;
      currently being used for research purposes only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 102 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
