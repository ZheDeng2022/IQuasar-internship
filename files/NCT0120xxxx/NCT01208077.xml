  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multinational registry (3 USA, 2 European centers) will capture in the ED continuous non&#xD;
      invasive hemodynamic monitoring (using Nexfin finger cuff technology) of patients presenting&#xD;
      with acute heart failure, stroke syndromes and systemic infection. Patients will be observed&#xD;
      after their Emergency Department (ED) disposition to determine clinical outcomes (length of&#xD;
      stay in the hospital, the development of any organ dysfunction, mortality and need for&#xD;
      unscheduled medical care within the ensuing 30 days). It is anticipated that specific ED&#xD;
      hemodynamic profiles will be predictive of better clinical outcomes than others. This&#xD;
      information will provide the outcome data needed to design future therapeutic trials that&#xD;
      will evaluate the effect of ED hemodynamic manipulations on overall patient management and&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The PREMIUM Registry is a multinational, prospective, observational convenience study of the&#xD;
      ED hemodynamic profiles of patients presenting with acute CHF, stroke and systemic infections&#xD;
      and their potential relationship with patient outcomes. Continuous hemodynamics will be&#xD;
      measured by noninvasive means using the Nexfin device and outcomes (in hospital length of&#xD;
      stay, the interval development of organ dysfunction and mortality or the need for unscheduled&#xD;
      medical care within the ensuing 30 days) will be captured within the registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treating ED physicians will be blinded to the hemodynamic monitoring and there will be no&#xD;
      modification of the standard care that each patient receives. Hospital charts will be&#xD;
      reviewed and patients/family members will be additionally called at 30 days after the&#xD;
      hospital visit in order to collect any additional outcome data.&#xD;
