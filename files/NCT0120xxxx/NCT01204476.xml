      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of cixutumumab when given together&#xD;
      with everolimus and octreotide acetate in treating patients with advanced low- or&#xD;
      intermediate-grade neuroendocrine cancer. Monoclonal antibodies, such as cixutumumab, may&#xD;
      find tumor cells and help carry tumor-killing substances to them. Everolimus may stop the&#xD;
      growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Octreotide&#xD;
      acetate may interfere with the growth of tumor cells and slow the growth of neuroendocrine&#xD;
      cancer. Giving cixutumumab together with everolimus and octreotide acetate may be a better&#xD;
      treatment for neuroendocrine cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To recommend a phase 2 dose for the combination of IMC-A12 (cixutumumab) and everolimus,&#xD;
      given with octreotide long-acting release (LAR) (octreotide acetate), in patients with&#xD;
      advanced neuroendocrine tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To describe the pharmacokinetics of IMC-A12 given once every 21 days in combination with&#xD;
      everolimus and octreotide LAR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate pharmacodynamic markers in blood, and tumor tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety profile of IMC-A12 and everolimus with octreotide LAR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To explore the anti-tumor activity of the combination of IMC-A12 and everolimus as&#xD;
      defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) response rate and&#xD;
      progression-free survival (PFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To explore baseline molecular marker and drug-induced molecular marker changes that may&#xD;
      predict clinical outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of cixutumumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive cixutumumab intravenously (IV) over 60-90 minutes and octreotide acetate&#xD;
      intramuscularly (IM) on day 1 and everolimus orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21.&#xD;
      Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 18 courses in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.&#xD;
