  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this Phase I/II clinical trial, the investigators seek to pilot the addition of&#xD;
      hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) to the standard front-line therapy of colorectal cancer,&#xD;
      FOLFOX/bevacizumab. In toxicity terms, the investigators previous studies lead them to&#xD;
      believe that a full dose (800mg) of HCQ will be well-tolerated in this setting. By starting&#xD;
      at 600 mg, the investigators will ensure that the full dose is approached with an eye to&#xD;
      safety, and if needed, the investigators will use the lower dose. Both doses achieve&#xD;
      autophagy inhibition in our current studies.&#xD;

      In this Phase I/II clinical trial, we seek to pilot the addition of HCQ to the standard&#xD;
      front-line therapy of colorectal cancer, FOLFOX/bevacizumab. In toxicity terms, our previous&#xD;
      studies lead us to believe that full dose (800mg) of HCQ will be welltolerated in this&#xD;
      setting. By starting at 600 mg, we will ensure that the full dose is approached with an eye&#xD;
      to safety, and if needed, we will use the lower dose. Both doses achieve autophagy inhibition&#xD;
      in our current studies: for this reason, we are comfortable in including accrual to both&#xD;
      dose-levels to the Phase II endpoints. If results are particularly striking, we will consider&#xD;
      amending the study to expand accrual if the budget permits, but 25 patients permits an&#xD;
      adequate assessment of activity of a novel regimen. The correlative endpoints of this trial&#xD;
      are directed to the pharmacokinetics of HCQ, and pharmacodynamics of autophagy inhibition. We&#xD;
      are currently constructing a population pharmacokinetic model of HCQ based on data from&#xD;
      several ongoing trials, and the data from these patients will contribute to refining the&#xD;
      model. We will analyze both measured and modelpredicted indices for their relationship to&#xD;
      autophagy induction. Autophagy will be assessed as the accumulation of autophagocytic&#xD;
      vesicles in the PMNs of treated patients, together with the induction of the expression of&#xD;
      autophagyrelated proteins on western analysis, quantitated by densitometry. An exploratory&#xD;
      correlative endpoint is the induction of metabolic changes as measured by 18FDG-PET. Our&#xD;
      mechanistic hypothesis in this work is that the addition of HCQ will lead to a greater amount&#xD;
      of cell death in the hypoxic regions of the tumor, that have increased as a consequence of&#xD;
      bevacizumab treatment. We will document the rates of metabolic response as a consequence of&#xD;
      treatment, as a therapeutic marker that may be related to the degree of autophagy inhibition.&#xD;
      Finally, since we have demonistrated the key role of JNK1 in the induction of autophagy, we&#xD;
      will analyze archival tumor materials to determine variability in this marker, as a baseline&#xD;
      for potential future trials.&#xD;
