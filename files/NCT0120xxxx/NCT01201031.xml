  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vancomycin -resistant enterococci(VRE) has emerged as one of the most common nosocomial&#xD;
      pathogen of health-care associated infection since 1988. Although the new antimicrobial&#xD;
      agents such as Tigecycline , Daptomycin, Linezolid have clinically effectiveness for the&#xD;
      treatment of VRE, but there was not appropriate drugs for eradicating the colonization of&#xD;
      VRE. So the active surveillance and strict contact precaution are the best methods for VRE&#xD;
      colonization and transmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a one year study program, we select a unit as the study site. First month (January)&#xD;
      is the prepare period. Therefore , we collect 3 months (from February to April) baseline&#xD;
      data, then interrupted one month(May) for the health care worker's infection control&#xD;
      education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then the intervention period are three months (from June to August), and the last four&#xD;
      months(from September to December) are the analysis and evaluation period. In the baseline&#xD;
      period, we only do the patient's active surveillance and environmental culture. In the&#xD;
      intervention period, beside the patient's active surveillance and environmental culture, we&#xD;
      add contact precaution as the infection control method. If patient has VRE infection, we&#xD;
      prescribe appropriate antibiotic therapy until the culture result proved no growth of VRE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to compare and analyze these two period (baseline period and&#xD;
      intervention period) for understanding the transmission, risk factors and carriage rate of&#xD;
      VRE, as the important guidelines for the VRE infection control in the future.&#xD;
