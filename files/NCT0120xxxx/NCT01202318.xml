  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the diagnostic accuracy of Card 28 stroke protocol to Card 28 and&#xD;
      Cincinnati Stroke Scale, when used by emergency medical dispatchers to interrogate a 911 call&#xD;
      suggestive of stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The authors hypothesize that a combination of Card 28 plus the Cincinnati Stroke Scale (CSS)&#xD;
      will improve the diagnostic accuracy of emergency medical dispatchers for stroke.&#xD;

        The target study population consists of all 911 callers with symptoms suggestive of stroke&#xD;
        in the participating county. Specifically, the accessible population for this study is the&#xD;
        group of patients whose 911 calls are answered and interrogated by the emergency medical&#xD;
        dispatchers at the County Communication Center, Santa Clara.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. All 911 calls transferred by local Public Service Answering Points (PSAPs) to the&#xD;
             County Communication center of Santa Clara County where the emergency medical&#xD;
             dispatchers complete the interrogation using MPDS protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. All 911 calls received directly at the County Communication center of Santa Clara&#xD;
             County where emergency medical dispatchers complete the interrogation using the MPDS&#xD;
             protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. All 911 calls received from subjects (patient) aged &gt; 18 years or second party calls&#xD;
             (by-stander or family who are in close proximity to the patient and can administer the&#xD;
             tool) by subjects &gt; 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. All calls that require immediate response (ECHO level determinant for life threatening&#xD;
             conditions) and emergency medical dispatchers cannot complete Card 28&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Calls answered by emergency medical dispatchers who have not completed training on the&#xD;
             use of Cincinnati Stroke Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Calls originating from the cities of Palo Alto, Mountain View, Sunnyvale, Santa Clara,&#xD;
             and San Jose that are not interrogated by the County Communication Center for Santa&#xD;
             Clara County.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. 911 calls with no available outcomes in the final discharge database.&#xD;
