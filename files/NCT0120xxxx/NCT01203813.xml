      Aim 1: To assess whether quality of care for stage 3 chronic kidney disease can be&#xD;
      substantially improved over 18 months by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Point of care electronic alerts to primary care physicians recommending risk-appropriate&#xD;
           care, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quarterly mailings to patients providing self management support materials, including&#xD;
           tailored recommendations based on personalized data from an electronic disease registry&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To assess the relationship between utilization of the intervention components and&#xD;
      primary care physician attitudes towards both chronic kidney disease management and&#xD;
      electronic reminder systems.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Specific Aim 1 We will develop software to calculate the estimated glomerular filtration&#xD;
      rates for all patients presenting to primary care physicians randomized to the intervention&#xD;
      arm, and identify patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rates in the range of 30&#xD;
      to 59. We will create three electronic alerts that intervention clinicians will receive upon&#xD;
      accessing the patient chart based on whether the patient is high risk or low risk. These&#xD;
      alerts will focus on recommending overdue laboratory tests (urine protein, blood cholesterol,&#xD;
      etc), as well as recommending guideline appropriate medications (ACE inhibitors), and&#xD;
      nephrology referral when appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will provide self management support materials to patients of primary care physicians&#xD;
      randomized to the intervention arm. We will rely on primary care physicians to enroll&#xD;
      patients by first recommending referral via the electronic alerts. On a monthly basis, we&#xD;
      will identify patient visits during which an alert fired and no referral was placed. We will&#xD;
      distribute a list of these patients to each physician via inter-office mail at least every&#xD;
      other month. The mailing will ask physicians to return the list indicating which patients&#xD;
      should be enrolled in the program, and our project manager will place the referrals. For&#xD;
      non-responding physicians, we will follow up with a reminder email. The patient mailings will&#xD;
      include recent clinical results and guideline-recommended targets, encouraging patients to&#xD;
      become more proactive in the management of their kidney disease. Once a patient is enrolled&#xD;
      in the program, they will receive similar mailings with updated personalized data and&#xD;
      recommendations every 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electronic referrals placed by primary care physicians for management of chronic kidney&#xD;
      disease will first be routed to the renal nurse, who will then initiate contact with the&#xD;
      patient. A total of two telephone calls followed by a letter will be made to contact the&#xD;
      patient. The nephrology visits will occur per standard clinical operations, including&#xD;
      evaluation by an attending nephrologist, as well as educational sessions with the renal nurse&#xD;
      and nutritionist. We will create new template notes within the electronic record for use by&#xD;
      the nephrologists to communicate clinical care recommendations back to the primary care&#xD;
      physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to starting the intervention, the study team will travel to each of the 14 health&#xD;
      centers to conduct orientation sessions with the primary care physicians. These sessions will&#xD;
      provide general information regarding the goals and scope of the upcoming intervention,&#xD;
      including demonstrations of the electronic alerts and the self management support outreach&#xD;
      program. A similar overview will also be provided to the HVMA Division of Nephrology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will randomize approximately 170 physicians into the intervention and control groups.&#xD;
      Physicians in the intervention group will receive patient-specific alerts at the time of&#xD;
      office visits for patients with Stage 3 kidney disease. Physicians in the control group will&#xD;
      not receive active alerts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will all be obtained electronically from automated extracts from the electronic health&#xD;
      record. Our study endpoints will be measured at 18 months and are specified according to risk&#xD;
      status. The primary endpoints among high risk patients will be 1) the presence of an office&#xD;
      visit in nephrology within the prior 12 months, and 2) the use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs for&#xD;
      those with hypertension or microalbuminuria. The primary endpoints among low risk patients&#xD;
      will include 1) a urine microalbumin result within the prior 12 months, and 2) the use of ACE&#xD;
      inhibitors or ARBs for those with hypertension or microalbuminuria. Hypertension will be&#xD;
      assessed based on the presence of a most recent blood pressure greater than 130/80 mmHg or a&#xD;
      current diagnosis of hypertension on the electronic problem list. A secondary endpoint for&#xD;
      both patient groups will be achieving a blood pressure less than 130/80 mmHg. We will also&#xD;
      assess primary care physician awareness of chronic kidney disease defined as use of&#xD;
      appropriate problem list and encounter diagnosis codes; and rates of annual serum LDL&#xD;
      cholesterol, hemoglobin, phosphorous, 25-OH-vitamin D, calcium, and parathyroid hormone&#xD;
      testing; as well as rates of LDL cholesterol control (&lt;100 mg/ dL) and anemia management&#xD;
      (hemoglobin &gt; 11 g/dL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will conduct an assessment of the self management support materials by surveying patients&#xD;
      directly to assess 1) their ratings of the delivery of self-management support by our&#xD;
      physician practice, 2) awareness of chronic kidney disease and treatment goals, and 3) the&#xD;
      utility of the information contained in the patient mailings. These surveys will be conducted&#xD;
      at two time points: baseline (first quarterly mailing) and completion of the study (final&#xD;
      quarterly mailing). We will conduct the survey at two time points to facilitate an analysis&#xD;
      of trends in patient experiences of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the impact of the intervention on each of our primary outcomes we will fit&#xD;
      hierarchical logistic regression models with random effects for patients within physicians&#xD;
      and physicians within centers. We will fit a set of similar models among three subgroups&#xD;
      defined by number of patient visits with their primary care physician during the 18 month&#xD;
      period (0 visits, 1-2 visits, â‰¥ 3 visits). We will fit two secondary models that include a&#xD;
      third independent variable for race or sex. The effect of the intervention on reducing race&#xD;
      or sex-based disparities will be assessed by examining race*group and sex*group interaction&#xD;
      terms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2 We will use the physician survey to collect data on primary care physician&#xD;
      support for electronic reminders and patient self management, and preparedness to manage&#xD;
      kidney disease. Physician responses will be collected using 5 point and 4 point Likert&#xD;
      scales, and we will examine the distribution of responses for each survey item to create&#xD;
      three dichotomous predictor variables of 1) high support for electronic reminders, 2) high&#xD;
      support for patient self management, and 3) high preparedness for managing kidney disease.&#xD;
      The primary outcomes will be the proportion of electronic alerts accompanied by ordering of&#xD;
      1) the recommended treatment, or 2) referral for patient self management support. We will&#xD;
      construct three separate linear regression models for each dichotomous predictor variable&#xD;
      defined above, with the proportion of times that the appropriate decision support feature is&#xD;
      used as a continuous outcome variable. The dichotomous physician survey outcome measures will&#xD;
      be used as the primary independent variables. We will further assess the statistical&#xD;
      significance of an interaction term between physician randomization status and each of the&#xD;
      three dichotomous survey outcomes in our primary models from Specific Aim 2 to test whether&#xD;
      electronic alerts are more or less effective depending on physician reported attitudes.&#xD;
