  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the safety of a drug called lapatinib and how well it works. Lapatinib&#xD;
      (also called Tyverb or Tykerb) will be compared with another drug trastuzumab (also called&#xD;
      Herceptin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trastuzumab is an antibody against the HER2 protein. It binds to part of the HER2 protein to&#xD;
      stop it working. Clinical trials have found that adding trastuzumab to chemotherapy lowers&#xD;
      the rate of cancer recurrence and improves survival in women with HER2 positive breast&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lapatinib also stops the HER2 protein working and may slow or stop cancer cells from growing&#xD;
      and may prevent cancer from returning. Lapatinib has been approved in some countries to treat&#xD;
      patients with certain types of breast cancer. However lapatinib has not been approved to&#xD;
      treat early breast cancer. This study is one of many being carried out involving lapatinib in&#xD;
      early breast cancer and these studies are showing that it is a promising treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will compare lapatinib and trastuzumab. One group of people will take lapatinib&#xD;
      and another group will take trastuzumab. The effects of the drugs, both good and bad, will be&#xD;
      compared. This study will compare two different durations of HER2 treatment to see if earlier&#xD;
      introduction of HER2 treatment is beneficial. The lapatinib group will receive HER2 treatment&#xD;
      from the very beginning for 24 weeks prior to surgery and the trastuzumab group will only&#xD;
      receive HER2 therapy for 12 weeks prior to surgery.&#xD;

      This is a randomized, parallel-arm, open-label, multicentre, Phase II study to determine the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of lapatinib in combination with epirubicin and cyclophosphamide (EC90-L)&#xD;
      followed by paclitaxel and lapatinib (PX-L) compared with EC90 followed by paclitaxel and&#xD;
      trastuzumab (PX-T) as systemic neoadjuvant therapy for patients with previously untreated,&#xD;
      operable, ErbB2-overexpressing, Stage I- IIIA breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 164 subjects will be enrolled in the study. Subjects will be randomised in a&#xD;
      1:1 ratio and stratified according to the following factors, each of which must be&#xD;
      established prior to commencing randomisation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumour size (≤ 2 cm versus &gt;2 cm in diameter).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Locally determined ER status (either ER positive or negative).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomised to one of two treatment arms and will receive the following study&#xD;
      treatments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm A: Experimental Arm (n=82) Part I (Week 1-12) Epirubicin 90 mg/m2 by IV infusion on Day 1&#xD;
      every 21 days Cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 by IV infusion on Day 1 every 21 days Lapatinib 1000&#xD;
      mg orally once daily continuously Loperamide as required for the proactive management of&#xD;
      diarrhoea (see Section 5.13.6)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part II (Week 13-24) Paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 by IV infusion on Day 1 of each week Lapatinib 1000&#xD;
      mg orally once daily continuously Loperamide as required for the proactive management of&#xD;
      diarrhoea (see Section 5.13.6)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm B: Reference Arm (n=82):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part I (Week 1-12) Epirubicin 90 mg/m2 by IV infusion on Day 1 every 21 days Cyclophosphamide&#xD;
      600 mg/m2 by IV infusion on Day 1 every 21 days Part II (Week 13-24) Paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 by&#xD;
      IV infusion on Day 1 of each week Trastuzumab 4 mg/kg IV load followed by 2 mg/kg IV Day 1 of&#xD;
      each week&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary study period includes the screening phase, administration of randomized&#xD;
      neo-adjuvant study treatment, and assessments up to the primary endpoint assessment at the&#xD;
      time of definitive breast cancer surgery.&#xD;
