      The purpose of this randomized Phase III study is to determine whether preoperative focused&#xD;
      microwave heat treatment and chemotherapy combined are more effective than preoperative&#xD;
      chemotherapy alone in the treatment of large breast cancer tumors in the intact breast.&#xD;
      Combining heat with chemotherapy before surgery might shrink the tumor so that it can be&#xD;
      removed in a breast conserving surgery (lumpectomy) instead of a mastectomy.&#xD;

      This randomized multicenter Phase III clinical trial is intended to provide histopathological&#xD;
      and clinical information on an innovative, minimally-invasive approach (focused microwave&#xD;
      thermotherapy) to the preoperative treatment of breast cancer, using a minimally invasive&#xD;
      focused microwave phased array device, the Medifocus, Inc. APA 1000 Breast Thermotherapy&#xD;
      Treatment System (heat treatment). Subjects with large primary operable breast cancer, in the&#xD;
      intact breast, with clinical tumor size greater than or equal to 3.5 cm (including tumor&#xD;
      classification T2 or T3), clinically node negative N0 or node positive (N1 or N2) with&#xD;
      distant metastasis (M1) or without distant metastasis (M0) will be randomized (ratio 1:1) to&#xD;
      receive (1) preoperative thermotherapy combined with preoperative anthracycline-based&#xD;
      combination chemotherapy and standard of care versus (2) preoperative anthracycline-based&#xD;
      combination chemotherapy and standard of care alone. The anthracycline-based regimen will be&#xD;
      limited to those of the current National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for&#xD;
      dose/drug/schedule at the time of patient enrollment. In both arms of the study, standard of&#xD;
      care including breast imaging, drugs, and radiation therapy will be provided to all eligible&#xD;
      subjects during and following the preoperative regimen. At the clinical discretion of the&#xD;
      treating physician, subjects that are estrogen-receptor positive may receive Tamoxifen&#xD;
      therapy the day following the completion of chemotherapy. Radiation therapy to the breast&#xD;
      tissues and lymph nodes will be given as part of the standard of care for eligible subjects.&#xD;
      Treatment Arm I (new arm) regimen includes three preoperative thermotherapy treatments at&#xD;
      intervals corresponding to the first three cycles of anthracycline-based combination&#xD;
      chemotherapy plus standard of care. The addition of preoperative thermotherapy to&#xD;
      preoperative anthracycline-based combination chemotherapy may improve the tumor response rate&#xD;
      in terms of shrinkage (the primary endpoint) and may increase the option to perform breast&#xD;
      conservation (a secondary endpoint) compared to that achieved with preoperative&#xD;
      anthracycline-based combination chemotherapy and standard of care alone. Note: Since there is&#xD;
      no consensus combination drug regimen for neoadjuvant treatment of large breast cancer&#xD;
      tumors, each study site will use its own standard of care which will include other&#xD;
      chemotherapy/drug agents commonly used in combination with an anthracycline (Doxorubicin&#xD;
      (trade name Adriamycin) or Epirubicin (trade name Ellence)), which is the study base drug&#xD;
      type.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale for including patients that have distant metastasis (M1) at enrollment in this&#xD;
      study is as follows. Traditionally, patients with stage IV (metastatic) breast cancer and an&#xD;
      intact primary breast tumor have been treated with chemotherapy and radiation for palliation&#xD;
      of symptoms, because this metastatic condition is considered to be an incurable disease. In&#xD;
      some cases, surgery has been considered for stage IV patients with large, symptomatic breast&#xD;
      lesions to control local wound complications and to improve quality of life. However, four&#xD;
      recent retrospective peer-reviewed studies have suggested that removing the primary tumor may&#xD;
      lead to an improvement in overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator or designee will fully explain the nature of the study to the subject, along&#xD;
      with the aims, methods, anticipated benefits, potential hazards and discomfort that&#xD;
      participation might entail. After the nature of the study has been explained and all the&#xD;
      subject's questions have been answered, and if the subject agrees to participate in the&#xD;
      study, the informed consent will be reviewed and signed by the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will be treated by thermochemotherapy (new arm) or chemotherapy alone (control&#xD;
      arm) and followed for 90 days after surgery during the study. Patients will be followed&#xD;
      annually as practiced as standard of care by each participating institution - patients will&#xD;
      be followed for tumor recurrence and future medical intervention related to the patient's&#xD;
      breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thermotherapy is administered in an out-patient setting. During thermotherapy which is&#xD;
      completed in approximately 60 minutes or less, the patient is treated in the prone position&#xD;
      on a treatment bed. After administering a local anesthetic, to guide the treatment a&#xD;
      minimally invasive combination microwave/temperature probe is placed in the tumor under&#xD;
      ultrasound guidance. The thermotherapy treatment is adjusted in accordance with patient&#xD;
      comfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthracycline-based chemotherapy will be administered in accordance with standard&#xD;
      preoperative chemotherapy delivery at each study center - the number of chemotherapy cycles&#xD;
      and cycle timing may vary in this study. Each study center will be using anthracycline&#xD;
      (Doxorubicin or Epidoxorubicin) as the base chemotherapy agent and the other chemotherapy&#xD;
      agents and drugs will vary depending on the study center and subject specific needs. Each&#xD;
      cycle of Doxorubicin at 60 mg/m2 for four cycles or Epidoxorubicin at 100 mg/m2 for 6 cycles&#xD;
      and combination Standard of Care chemotherapy will be administered nominally every 21 (plus&#xD;
      or minues 7) days. The timing between cycles of anthracycline can be subject specific at the&#xD;
      physician's discretion, but in no case will anthracycline be administered with a cycle timing&#xD;
      of less than seven (7) days between anthracycline cycles. A thermotherapy session will be&#xD;
      administered on the same day as the administration of the first, second, and third cycle of&#xD;
      preoperative Doxorubicin or Epidoxorubicin chemotherapy. Chemotherapy will be administered&#xD;
      and then the subject will receive thermotherapy. (If the thermotherapy session cannot be&#xD;
      administered on the same day as Doxorubicin or Epidoxorubicin chemotherapy it will be&#xD;
      administered as soon as possible the following day but no later than 36 hours post&#xD;
      Doxorubicin or Epidoxorubicin chemotherapy. The remaining cycle(s) of chemotherapy will then&#xD;
      be administered without thermotherapy. If the desired cumulative minimum thermal dose is&#xD;
      achieved in the first three thermotherapy treatments, the remaining cycle(s) of chemotherapy&#xD;
      will then be administered without thermotherapy. If the desired cumulative minimum thermal&#xD;
      dose is not achieved during the first three preoperative Doxorubicin or Epidoxorubicin&#xD;
      chemotherapy cycles, thermotherapy will be administered with the fourth cycle of preoperative&#xD;
      chemotherapy. If the subject cannot tolerate more than one or two thermotherapy treatments,&#xD;
      the subject will continue in the study on the remaining cycles of chemotherapy. If the&#xD;
      subject has clinically progressive disease, the thermo-chemotherapy treatment will be&#xD;
      discontinued and the subject will receive the remaining cycles of chemotherapy preoperatively&#xD;
      or postoperatively (as standard care).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the course of thermo-chemotherapy or chemotherapy alone, and following all&#xD;
      pre-surgery evaluations, the surgeon and subject will make decisions on the extent of surgery&#xD;
      to be performed. These decisions will be made on the basis of surgical and institutional&#xD;
      standards, and those of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Breast Cancer&#xD;
      Treatment Guidelines. Subjects will undergo mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery. It is&#xD;
      understood that some subjects will select mastectomy for treatment even when the surgeon&#xD;
      recommends breast conservation. The surgeon shall document the reasons why either mastectomy&#xD;
      or breast conservation was selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject will undergo clinical exam and imaging of the breast to measure tumor size, the&#xD;
      day prior to or the day of the lumpectomy or mastectomy. Any additional imaging will be at&#xD;
      the discretion of the physician. At the discretion of the physician, an optional core biopsy&#xD;
      of the tumor will be taken the day prior or the day of the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following surgery, pathology will be performed on the excised breast tumor tissue to&#xD;
      determine tumor cell death. For breast conservation, the breast must be of sufficient size to&#xD;
      allow adequate tumor removal with a satisfactory cosmetic result. The objective of surgery is&#xD;
      to obtain local control of the breast cancer with the best cosmetic result possible. A breast&#xD;
      conservation surgery procedure requires excision of the tumor and margins without removal of&#xD;
      more normal breast tissue than is required to achieve negative margins. Pathologic evaluation&#xD;
      of the excised tissue will determine whether the margins are negative or positive. For&#xD;
      subjects with involved margins following breast conservation surgery, if the breast will&#xD;
      tolerate it, the subject may undergo one or more further segmental resections in order to&#xD;
      achieve clear margins.&#xD;
