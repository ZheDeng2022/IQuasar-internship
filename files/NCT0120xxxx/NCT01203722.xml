  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      If transplantation using mismatched unrelated donors or non-first-degree relatives could be&#xD;
      performed with an acceptable toxicity profile, an important unmet need would be served.&#xD;
      Towards this goal, the current study extends our platform of nonmyeloablative, partially&#xD;
      HLA-mismatched bone marrow transplant (BMT) and Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplant (PBSCT)&#xD;
      to the use of such donors, investigating up to several postgrafting immunosuppression&#xD;
      regimens that incorporate high-dose Cy. Of central interest is the incorporation of sirolimus&#xD;
      into this postgrafting immunosuppression regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal for phase 1 is to identify a transplant regimen associated with acceptable&#xD;
      rates of severe acute GVHD and NRM by Day 100 and for phase 2 estimate the 6-month&#xD;
      probability of survival without having had acute grade III- IV GVHD or graft failure.&#xD;

             non-cytotoxic HLA specific antibodies may be permissible if they are found to be at a&#xD;
             level well below that detectable by flow cytometry. This will be decided on a&#xD;
             case-by-case basis by the PI and one of the immunogenetics directors. Pheresis to&#xD;
             reduce anti-HLA antibodies is permissible; however eligibility to proceed with the&#xD;
             transplant regimen would be contingent upon the result.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Donor Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Donor must not be HLA identical to the recipient.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has not donated blood products to recipient.&#xD;
