      Evaluation of Blood Brain Barrier Permeability in Chronic Stroke&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mordechai Lorberboym, M.D.1, Yair Lampl, M.D.2, Ronit Gilad, M.D.2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the Department of Nuclear Medicine1 and the department of Neurology2 of the Edith&#xD;
      Wolfson Medical Center, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blood brain barrier (BBB) is a highly selective barrier of brain microvascular&#xD;
      endothelial cells that shields the brain from toxic substances in the blood, supplies brain&#xD;
      tissues with nutrients, and filters harmful compounds from the brain back to the bloodstream&#xD;
      (1). Transport across the BBB is strictly limited through both physical (tight junctions) and&#xD;
      metabolic barriers (enzymes, diverse transport systems). BBB breakdown or alterations in&#xD;
      transport systems play an important role in the pathogenesis of many CNS diseases (HIV-1&#xD;
      encephalitis, Alzheimer's disease, ischemia, tumors, multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cerebral ischemia leads to disruption of blood flow, increased BBB permeability, and is&#xD;
      associated with rapid depletion of essential nutrients and oxygen (2-3). Only a few studies&#xD;
      were designed in humans in order to compare the degree of BBB changes and the neurological&#xD;
      outcome after a stroke. The most significant stage of BBB breakdown occurs in humans within&#xD;
      48-72 hours post infarction and is accompanied by increased brain edema volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators performed a study on thirty patients with acute stroke of the middle&#xD;
      cerebral artery using technetium-99m-DTPA brain SPECT (4). Tc-99m-DTPA (Diethylenetriamine-&#xD;
      pentacetic acid) brain scintigraphy is a useful technique for the assessment of BBB&#xD;
      disruption. Is has been used in the past to localize areas within the cranium which had been&#xD;
      disrupted by infection, neoplasms, trauma or stroke. The study showed that the magnitude of&#xD;
      disruption of the BBB was negatively correlated with the change in neurological status with a&#xD;
      sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 89%. Interestingly, a significant proportion of&#xD;
      patients with stroke (23%) had no gross evidence of BBB disruption, all of them with very&#xD;
      good prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is unclear for how long the BBB remains disrupted after a stroke, and whether there is any&#xD;
      correlation between the BBB permeability and recurrent ischemic events or delayed functional&#xD;
      and neurological outcome after a stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the investigators intend to explore the long term significance of BBB&#xD;
      disruption on the clinical course and the rate of significant recurrent ischemic events in&#xD;
      patients with a chronic stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and methods Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Male and female patients at any age with a history of a large stroke in the territory of the&#xD;
      middle cerebral artery, occurring 1-2 years ago or between 2-5 years ago.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exlusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      40 patients will be recruited from the Neurological Outpatient Clinic of the Edith Wolfson&#xD;
      Medical Center and from the Neurological Department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the SPECT study each patient will receive 740 MBq Tc-99m-DTPA and a SPECT study will be&#xD;
      performed 60-90- minutes later. A dual head or a triple head gamma camera is usually used,&#xD;
      equipped with high resolution collimators.&#xD;
