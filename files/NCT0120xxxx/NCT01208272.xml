      Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has documented efficacy for the treatment of binge eating&#xD;
      disorder (BED). Interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) has been shown to reduce binge eating but&#xD;
      its long-term impact and time course on other BED-related symptoms remain largely unknown.&#xD;
      This study compares the effects of group CBT and group IPT across BED-related symptoms among&#xD;
      overweight individuals with BED. METHODS: One hundred sixty-two overweight patients meeting&#xD;
      DSM-IV criteria for BED were randomly assigned to 20 weekly sessions of either group CBT or&#xD;
      group IPT. Assessments of binge eating and associated eating disorder psychopathology,&#xD;
      general psychological functioning, and weight occurred before treatment, at posttreatment,&#xD;
      and at 4-month intervals up to 12 months following treatment. RESULTS: Binge-eating recovery&#xD;
      rates were equivalent for CBT and IPT at posttreatment (64 [79%] of 81 vs 59 [73%] of 81) and&#xD;
      at 1-year follow-up (48 [59%] of 81 vs 50 [62%] of 81). Binge eating increased slightly&#xD;
      through follow-up but remained significantly below pretreatment levels. Across treatments,&#xD;
      patients had similar significant reductions in associated eating disorders and psychiatric&#xD;
      symptoms and maintenance of gains through follow-up. Dietary restraint decreased more quickly&#xD;
      in CBT but IPT had equivalent levels by later follow-ups. Patients' relative weight decreased&#xD;
      significantly but only slightly, with the greatest reduction among patients sustaining&#xD;
      recovery from binge eating from posttreatment to 1-year follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Group IPT is&#xD;
      a viable alternative to group CBT for the treatment of overweight patients with BED. Although&#xD;
      lacking a nonspecific control condition limits conclusions about treatment specificity, both&#xD;
      treatments showed initial and long-term efficacy for the core and related symptoms of BED.&#xD;
