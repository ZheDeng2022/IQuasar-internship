      The objective of this study is to compare the effects of a web-based laboratory information&#xD;
      system (e-Chasqui) between a network of health establishments with access to e-Chasqui&#xD;
      (intervention group) and a network of health establishments without access to e-Chasqui&#xD;
      (control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare the &quot;laboratory turn-around-time&quot; (from the date a culture or drug&#xD;
           susceptibility test (DST) result is obtained to the date the result is obtained at the&#xD;
           health center) of samples pertaining to health establishments in the intervention versus&#xD;
           the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare the &quot;clinical turn-around-time&quot; (from the date the DST result is obtained to&#xD;
           the date the patient is evaluated by a physician in possession of that result) among&#xD;
           multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) patients pertaining to health establishments&#xD;
           in the intervention versus control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To compare the laboratory reporting errors (defined as incorrect smear, culture, or DST&#xD;
           results) between health establishments in the intervention versus control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To qualitatively assess the acceptability and usability of e-Chasqui among users in&#xD;
           health establishments with access to the system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to test the following hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The laboratory turn-around-time for health establishments with e-Chasqui access will be&#xD;
           smaller than that for establishments without e-Chasqui access.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The clinical turn-around-time for patients pertaining to health establishments with&#xD;
           e-Chasqui access will be smaller than that for patients in establishments without&#xD;
           e-Chasqui access.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Health establishments with e-Chasqui access will have fewer errors compared to those&#xD;
           without e-Chasqui access.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Factors associated with acceptability and usability of e-Chasqui by systems users can be&#xD;
           identified.&#xD;

      Delays in starting patients with multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) on appropriate&#xD;
      medication treatment lead to worsened patient outcomes and increased risk of transmission. In&#xD;
      Peru, the National Tuberculosis Program (NTP) has provided treatment for patients with MDR-TB&#xD;
      since 1996, with cure rates ranging from 48% to 83%. Nonetheless, significant delays exist in&#xD;
      the diagnosis of MDR cases and timely treatment initiation, in particular since MDR-TB&#xD;
      treatment has been scaled to a national level. Our preliminary work has found that the&#xD;
      average turn-around-time (TAT) from the request of a DST to the prescription of appropriate&#xD;
      treatment was 148 days (4.9 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      An information system could be used to virtually eliminate part of this delay: the time to&#xD;
      communicate results between the different institutions. In 2001 we developed and deployed a&#xD;
      web based medical record system, the PIH-EMR, to assist in the clinical management of these&#xD;
      MDR-TB patients. This system includes a substantial set of data entry and analysis tools for&#xD;
      laboratory results including sputum smears, cultures and DSTs. Over the last six months the&#xD;
      PIH-EMR has been modified to support the decentralization of DSTs in the regional&#xD;
      laboratories. This laboratory component of the PIH-EMR, termed &quot;e-Chasqui,&quot; permits web-based&#xD;
      entry of culture and DST results at all regional and central laboratories performing these&#xD;
      tests. In addition, the system includes applications to assess quality control, generate&#xD;
      aggregate reports, notify health centers of new results or contaminated samples, and track&#xD;
      enrolled patients and the status of pending laboratory tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NTP and the National Reference Laboratory (NRL) have agreed to integrate e-Chasqui into&#xD;
      the current management of patients at risk of MDR-TB in two regions, and if effective, to&#xD;
      provide a national network of all laboratories performing DST. Because of the intensive&#xD;
      initial demands on resources and training, the implementation of the information system will&#xD;
      occur in stages (parts A and B of this study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Broadly put, this study will provide data on whether the use of information systems can be&#xD;
      shown to improve quality of patient care. More specifically, it will assess the impact of&#xD;
      e-Chasqui on reducing reporting delays and laboratory data errors, and improving patient&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective observational controlled study to compare the effects of a web-based&#xD;
      laboratory information system (e-Chasqui) between a network of health establishments with&#xD;
      e-Chasqui access (intervention group) compared with a network of health establishments&#xD;
      without e-Chasqui access (control group). The data is being collected by the overarching&#xD;
      study &quot;Operational Assessment of Diagnostic Methods for MDR-TB in Lima, Peru.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is planned in two parts: Part A will be a simultaneous control study occurring in&#xD;
      the &quot;transition&quot; period comparing endpoints in those health establishments with e-Chasqui&#xD;
      access to those in matched health establishments without e-Chasqui access. Part B will be an&#xD;
      historical control study comparing endpoints in the establishments which gain initial&#xD;
      e-Chasqui access, before (historical control) and after (intervention) the implementation.&#xD;
      Data sources include: patient charts, interview with health providers to confirm or clarify&#xD;
      accuracy of data in patient charts, microbiology registries at local, regional and national&#xD;
      laboratories, and the information system database. The total number of subjects to be&#xD;
      enrolled study-wide is 1849.&#xD;
