      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Essential tremor (ET) is a neurological disorder involving uncontrollable shaking, which&#xD;
      over time can interfere with mobility and affect routine aspects of daily living. Several&#xD;
      medications are used to treat ET, but these medications are often only partially effective&#xD;
      and can have side effects. About two-thirds (66%) of people with ET have some relief from&#xD;
      drinking alcohol, which suggests that alcohol affects the part of the brain causing the&#xD;
      tremor. However, more research is needed to better understand the effects of alcohol or what&#xD;
      areas of the brain might be important in the response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study to what extent alcohol is reducing tremor in a group of patients with essential&#xD;
           tremor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To use transcranial magnetic stimulation to study the effects of alcohol on essential&#xD;
           tremor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals who are at least 21 years of age, have been diagnosed with essential tremor and&#xD;
      have tremor in both hands, and can tolerate being off all medications for essential tremor&#xD;
      for up to 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study has one screening visit (1 to 2 hours), followed by one study visit (3 to 5&#xD;
           hours). Participants might be asked to also take part in one additional study visit (3&#xD;
           to 5 hours). The maximum period between the study visits is 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history, physical examination, and blood&#xD;
           tests. At this visit, participants will receive information about how to safely taper&#xD;
           off their current ET medications before the start of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants must be willing to abstain from drinking any alcohol or caffeine (or&#xD;
           consuming foods with caffeine such as chocolate) for at least 2 days before the study&#xD;
           visits. Participants must also fast overnight (for at least 8 hours) before the study&#xD;
           visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the first study visit, participants will receive a single drink of alcohol (mixed&#xD;
           with a noncaffeinated drink) and will complete movement tests to determine whether the&#xD;
           alcohol improves the tremor. Alcohol levels will be monitored throughout the visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the second study visit, participants will have an electrocardiogram to measure heart&#xD;
           electrical activity and determine if they are able to safely have transcranial magnetic&#xD;
           stimulation. Participants will then receive an intravenous infusion of alcohol and&#xD;
           complete questionnaires during the infusion to provide information about its effects.&#xD;
           Then, transcranial magnetic stimulation will be used to study brain electrical activity,&#xD;
           as well as muscle movements and tremor activity, while under the influence of the&#xD;
           alcohol infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After each study visit, participants will remain at the clinical center until the&#xD;
           effects of the alcohol have worn off. Participants will be able to resume taking their&#xD;
           ET medications after the end of the study.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to investigate the clinical and electrophysiological&#xD;
      correlates of the ethanol response in suppressing the tremor amplitude in patients with&#xD;
      essential tremor (ET).&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      85 patients with clinically diagnosed ET according to published diagnostic criteria will be&#xD;
      entered into study phase 1. From the groups of participants in study phase 1, 12 responders&#xD;
      and 12 non-responders will be invited back to participate in study phase 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In study phase 1, the response to ethanol will be measured by a quantitative and qualitative&#xD;
      approach using Essential Tremor (ET) spiral analysis during a standardized oral ethanol&#xD;
      challenge. The clinical response will be correlated to breath-alcohol levels. Participants of&#xD;
      study phase 1 will be selected based on their rate of response - dichotomized into a group of&#xD;
      responders vs. non-responders - for study phase 2, during an IV ethanol challenge, brain&#xD;
      excitability will be tested using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME MEASURES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the primary outcome parameter of study phase 1, we will determine the patients who respond&#xD;
      to ethanol by tremor reduction versus patients without reduction of tremor intensities, as&#xD;
      measured using spiral analysis of the dominant hand. Criterion for response will be&#xD;
      operationally defined in a dichotomized fashion as reduction of tremor intensities, larger&#xD;
      than the known diurnal variation of ET. Therefore, a patient will be considered a responder,&#xD;
      if spirographic tremor amplitudes decrease by 35% or more at the time-point 60 minutes after&#xD;
      an oral ethanol administration, as compared to baseline. As secondary outcome parameters,&#xD;
      spiral data from the non-dominant hand, as well as clinical rating scales and breath alcohol&#xD;
      levels will be measured to correlate objective with subjective ratings of ethanol effect in&#xD;
      ET.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In study phase two, changes of short intracortical inhibition (SICI), known to be mediated by&#xD;
      GABAA, will be analyzed using TMS and compared between responders and non-responders before&#xD;
      and during a constant iv administration of ethanol. Secondary outcome parameters include the&#xD;
      measurement of changes of GABAB-mediated paradigms such as long intracortical inhibition&#xD;
      (LICI), cortical silent period (CSP), intracortical facilitation (ICF), motor evoked&#xD;
      potential recruitment curve as well as TMS-measures of cerebellar inhibition.&#xD;
