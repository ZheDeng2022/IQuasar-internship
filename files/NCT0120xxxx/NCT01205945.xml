  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Abdominal aortic aneurysm(AAA) occurs when the infrarenal aorta expands to a maximal diameter&#xD;
      of 3.0cm or greater. Although AAA may asymptomatic for many years, almost one third&#xD;
      eventually rupture if left untreated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several randomized trials showed that ultrasonographic screening for AAA could reduce the&#xD;
      frequency of acute operations and AAA-related mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, all of randomized trials were performed in Western countries. There was no&#xD;
      randomized trials for AAA screening in Asian countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized, controlled trial is to analyze the benefits of screening old population for&#xD;
      AAA in Korea.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Old population, aged from 60 to 85 years, are randomized into two groups; one group is&#xD;
      invited for ultrasonographic screening for AAA, and the other acts as age- and sex-matched&#xD;
      controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For screening group, The anterioposterior and transverse diameter of the infrarenal aorta is&#xD;
      measured at their maximal sizes. The subsequent surveillance of screened patients is done as&#xD;
      follows&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aortic diameter less than 3.0cm, no further testing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AAA 3 to 4cm, ultrasonographic follow-up every year&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AAA 4 to 5cm, ultrasonographic follow-up every 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AAA greater than 5cm, referral to a vascular surgeon&#xD;
&#xD;
      For control group, the information for any causes of death is collected every year.&#xD;
