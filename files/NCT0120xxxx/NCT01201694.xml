      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable doses of&#xD;
      surface-controlled water dispersible curcumin (curcumin) that can be given to patients with&#xD;
      advanced cancer. The safety of this drug will also be studied.&#xD;

      The Study Drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Curcumin is the active ingredient in the spice, turmeric. It is a natural anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      compound and has shown anti-tumor activity. Surface-controlled water dispersible curcumin is&#xD;
      designed to be better absorbed by the body than regular curcumin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level. Each new group will&#xD;
      usually receive a higher dose than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were&#xD;
      seen. Each group will have 3-6 participants. This will continue until the highest tolerable&#xD;
      dose of curcumin is found. Up to 6 dose levels of curcumin will be tested. Once the highest&#xD;
      tolerable dose of each arm is found, up to 14 extra participants will be enrolled for extra&#xD;
      safety testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In some cases, extra participants may be enrolled at dose levels shown to be safe for extra&#xD;
      safety and/or pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be assigned to a dose level based on when you join this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose of the study drug that you receive may be lowered if you have any intolerable side&#xD;
      effects. If you are tolerating the treatment, your study drug dose may be increased after the&#xD;
      first cycle to the highest dose level shown to be safe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each study &quot;cycle&quot; is 28 days long.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will take 1 dose of curcumin on Day 1 of Cycle 1. Starting on Day 2 of Cycle 1, you will&#xD;
      begin taking curcumin 2 times each day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Curcumin is a liquid that comes in a bottle, and you will take it by mouth on an empty&#xD;
      stomach with a full glass of water (8 ounces). If you are not tolerating the doses and your&#xD;
      doctor thinks it is needed, you may take curcumin in divided doses several times a day with&#xD;
      food.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before your first dose of study drug and during Week 2 of Cycle 2, you will complete a&#xD;
      questionnaire about your quality of life. It should take about 5-10 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every week of Cycle 1 and then as often as the doctor thinks it is needed, blood (about 2&#xD;
      teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before you begin each cycle:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your medical history will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any side effects you may be having.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of Cycle 2 and then every 2-3 cycles:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a chest x-ray, CT, MRI, and/or PET scan to check the status of the&#xD;
           disease. If the study doctor thinks it is needed, these scan may be performed more&#xD;
           often. You also may have extra types of scans not listed in this consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to measure&#xD;
           tumor markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PK Testing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood (about ½ teaspoon each time) will be drawn for PK testing at the following times:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On Day 1 of Cycle 1, blood will be drawn before the dose and then 6 more times over the&#xD;
           next 6 hours after the dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On Day 2 of Cycle 1, blood will be drawn 1 time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may remain on study for as long as the study doctor thinks it is in your best interest.&#xD;
      You will be taken off study early if the disease gets worse or you experience intolerable&#xD;
      side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation on the study will be over once you have completed the end-of-study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Study Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 30 days after your last dose of the study drug(s), you will have an end-of-study&#xD;
      visit. At this visit the following tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your medical history will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any side effects you may be having.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the study doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a chest x-ray, CT, MRI, and/or&#xD;
           PET scan to check the status of the disease. If the study doctor thinks it is needed,&#xD;
           you may also have extra types of scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the study doctor thinks it is needed, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to&#xD;
           measure tumor markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Curcumin is a commercially available substance, which is&#xD;
      commonly used as a food additive. Curcumin is not FDA approved for any usage. At this time,&#xD;
      curcumin is only being used in research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 72 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
