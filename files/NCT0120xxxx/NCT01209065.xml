  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK1349572 is an integrase inhibitor being developed for the treatment of human&#xD;
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) on behalf of Shionogi-ViiV&#xD;
      HealthcareLLC. In HIV-infected patients where combination antiretroviral therapy is the&#xD;
      standard of care, it is likely that it will be dosed with boosted protease inhibitors (PIs)&#xD;
      including fosamprenavir/ritonavir (FPV/RTV or FPV/r). As FPV and RTV are modulators&#xD;
      (induction as well as inhibition) of Uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) and&#xD;
      Cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A which are the primary and secondary metabolic pathways of GKS1349572,&#xD;
      it is likely that FPV/RTV will affect the pharmacokinetics (PK) of GSK1349572, therefore a&#xD;
      drug interaction study is warranted and will be evaluated in Part A of this study. Part B&#xD;
      will evaluate the effect of particle size of tablet variants on the PK of GSK1349572.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part A, approximately 12 subjects will receive GSK1349572 50mg every 24 hours (q24h) for 5&#xD;
      days (Treatment A). Subjects will then be administered GSK1349572 50mg q24h in combination&#xD;
      with FPV/RTV 700/100 mg every 12 hours (q12h) (Treatment B) for 10 days. There will be no&#xD;
      washout between treatments. In Part B 15 subjects will receive a single 50 mg dose (2 x 25mg&#xD;
      tablet) in 3 different tablet variants of the same formulation, differing only in particle&#xD;
      sizes of GSK1349572, under fasted conditions in a three-way crossover design. Safety&#xD;
      evaluations and serial PK samples will be collected during each treatment period. A follow-up&#xD;
      visit will occur 7-14 days after the last dose of study drug.&#xD;
