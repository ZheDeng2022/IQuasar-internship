  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether, among healthcare personnel who are&#xD;
      undecided about whether to receive influenza vaccine, does use of the OIDA increase or&#xD;
      decrease their confidence in their decision to be immunized? Furthermore, does the use of the&#xD;
      OIDA affect the intent of the healthcare personnel to be immunized or not immunized?&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Influenza is one of the leading causes of acute respiratory infection and results in&#xD;
      significant increases in average life-years lost, hospital lengths of stay and outpatient&#xD;
      clinic visits, representing an enormous economic burden for many countries. Healthcare&#xD;
      personnel are at particularly high risk of exposure to influenza as they are exposed in both&#xD;
      the community and in the workplace. Influenza vaccination for healthcare personnel has been&#xD;
      shown to reduce patient mortality in long-term care facilities as well as employee&#xD;
      absenteeism and financial costs in acute care settings. The Canadian National Advisory&#xD;
      Committee on Immunization (NACI) recommends that influenza immunization programs strive to&#xD;
      immunize at least 90% of eligible recipients. In fact, NACI regards influenza immunization of&#xD;
      healthcare personnel with direct patient care responsibilities as an essential component of&#xD;
      the standard of care for the protection of patients. They consider the refusal of healthcare&#xD;
      personnel without contraindications to receive influenza vaccine as a failure in their duty&#xD;
      of care to patients. Despite national recommendations and proven effectiveness, influenza&#xD;
      immunization coverage rates among healthcare personnel remain disappointingly low. In Canada,&#xD;
      coverage rates among healthcare personnel range from 26-61% while in the US only 38% of&#xD;
      healthcare personnel were immunized in 2002.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The decision to accept or refuse influenza vaccine each year may be a difficult one for many&#xD;
      healthcare personnel. Decisional conflict, a term used to describe the difficulty experienced&#xD;
      by an individual who simultaneously tends to both accept and reject a given course of action,&#xD;
      occurs in many medical decisions where the best choice often differs depending on how&#xD;
      individuals weigh the risks and benefits, and has been shown to contribute to poor vaccine&#xD;
      uptake. In a review of literature from 1985 to 2004, it was found that healthcare personnel&#xD;
      experience decisional conflict related to misperceptions about influenza, its risks, the role&#xD;
      of healthcare personnel in its transmission to patients, and the importance and risks of&#xD;
      vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient decision aids are tools that help people become involved in decision making by&#xD;
      providing information about the options and outcomes, and clarifying personal values. They&#xD;
      are designed to complement, rather than replace, counselling from a health practitioner. The&#xD;
      use of decision aids has been shown to decrease decisional conflict and result in improved&#xD;
      knowledge, more realistic expectations of benefit/risks and more active participation of&#xD;
      individuals in decision-making. To date, no decision aids have been published that focus on&#xD;
      influenza vaccination and none have been developed for healthcare personnel. Furthermore, the&#xD;
      effect of a decision aid on the uptake of vaccine in healthcare personnel is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The peer-reviewed Ottawa Influenza Decision Aid (OIDA) was developed to respond to the&#xD;
      aforementioned misconceptions and identify barriers of vaccine uptake in healthcare&#xD;
      personnel. The OIDA presents evidence-based information and guides the individual through the&#xD;
      decision-making process, including deliberation of personal values and beliefs.&#xD;

    <description>In keeping with the second objective of the trial, which is to measure the individual healthcare worker's decision to become immunized, the corresponding outcome measure is defined as a nominal variable registering the healthcare worker's self-reported course of action, to be used for estimating the rate of influenza immunization in each arm of the trial. In addition, the Occupational Health Department will provide information about the level of overall healthcare personnel immunization during running of the campaign after its first four weeks of operation.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        For the purposes of this trial, the participating healthcare organizations will be required&#xD;
        to:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Access a database of all healthcare personnel for whom influenza immunization is&#xD;
             recommended&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Collect real-time individual level immunization data about when healthcare personnel&#xD;
             receive the vaccine&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Generate a line-listing of all healthcare personnel for whom immunization status is&#xD;
             not yet known at a pre-specified point in the campaign (at the end of the first four&#xD;
             weeks of the campaign)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Contact the identified healthcare personnel in a manner approved by the healthcare&#xD;
             organization, for example, by mail or e-mail, about participating in the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Ideally, have an institutional policy or high-level agreement that requires all&#xD;
             healthcare personnel to provide evidence of their immunization status to occupational&#xD;
             health.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Agree to work with the project team to boost the response rate, potentially by&#xD;
             providing small tokens of appreciation to staff who complete the questionnaire or by&#xD;
             promoting the study through regular communication channels (such as their internal&#xD;
             network).&#xD;
