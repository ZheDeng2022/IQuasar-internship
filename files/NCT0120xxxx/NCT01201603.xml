      The aim of this study is primarily to investigate the ability of antioxidants found in orange&#xD;
      juice (OJ) to increase the body's sensitivity to the hormone insulin. Overweight or mildly&#xD;
      obese women, who are otherwise healthy, will be recruited. The time commitment for subjects&#xD;
      is ~14wks. Subjects will attend the laboratory on 5 occasions after fasting from midnight.&#xD;
      The 1st is a medical screening. Laboratory visits 2 &amp; 5 will take ~5hrs and will be separated&#xD;
      by 3 months, during which time subjects will consume 250ml of an orange drink (either OJ or&#xD;
      an orange flavoured control drink) once a day. During visits 2 &amp; 5, subjects will have a scan&#xD;
      to assess their %body fat using a low-dose x-ray machine, and have their insulin sensitivity&#xD;
      measured using a technique called a 'Glucose Clamp'. During the 3hr glucose clamp, subjects&#xD;
      receive an infusion of the hormone insulin and a glucose solution directly into their blood&#xD;
      stream, with insulin sensitivity determined from the amount of glucose required to maintain&#xD;
      blood glucose at normal levels. In addition, a small sample of fat tissue (about the size of&#xD;
      a haricot bean) will be taken from underneath the skin of the belly. Subjects will record&#xD;
      their food intake for 3-days in weeks 3, 7 and 11 of consuming the drink, and come to the lab&#xD;
      for visits 3&amp;4 during weeks 4&amp;8. Laboratory visits 3&amp;4 repeat measurements taken in the 1st&#xD;
      (screening) visit.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overweight and mild obesity are associated with insulin resistance and mild elevations in&#xD;
      lipid risk factors which are not usually sufficiently abnormal to merit treatment. Such&#xD;
      people are encouraged to lose weight to reduce their risk of progressing to type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      and coronary heart disease, but there is clearly a potential role for dietary modifications&#xD;
      to maximize any potential benefit of this weight loss. Flavonoids are known to have vascular&#xD;
      effects which might enhance substrate delivery to metabolically active tissues, and thus&#xD;
      improve insulin sensitivity. There are many different dietary sources of flavonoids, with&#xD;
      fruits such as apples, berries and citrus being rich sources. However, some researchers have&#xD;
      expressed concern that a high dietary intake of 100% juice may contribute to the development&#xD;
      of insulin resistance, obesity and the Metabolic Syndrome (Bazzano, Li et al. 2008), although&#xD;
      this is not universally accepted (Fujioka, Greenway et al. 2006; O'Neil and Nicklas 2008). To&#xD;
      date, there have been no studies investigating the effects of citrus fruits on indices of&#xD;
      cardio-metabolic health in people who are presently healthy but are at risk of developing&#xD;
      some features of the Metabolic Syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the effects of orange juice (OJ) intake on insulin sensitivity, appetite&#xD;
      hormones, blood pressure and plasma lipids. In addition we aim to investigate any gene&#xD;
      expression changes associated with OJ consumption, in particular in adipose tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental protocol and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overweight or obese women (BMI 27-35), who are otherwise healthy, will be recruited onto the&#xD;
      study. They will attend the 'David Greenfield Human Physiology' laboratories on 5 convenient&#xD;
      mornings, following an overnight fast. The 1st visit is a medical screening and will involve&#xD;
      signing a consent form, completing medical screening, food frequency and activity&#xD;
      questionnaires, having height, weight, and hip/waist circumference measurements taken and a&#xD;
      sample of blood taken for CBC, urea, electrolytes, LFT, TFT, glucose and insulin analysis.&#xD;
      Subjects will then be asked to complete a 3-day diet diary for macronutrient assessment and&#xD;
      to consume a diet providing 50% of energy as carbohydrate for 3 days prior to the 2nd&#xD;
      laboratory visit. This 2nd visit will involve having a DEXA body composition scan, an adipose&#xD;
      tissue biopsy and a 3-hr hyperinsulinemic, euglycemic glucose clamp. Starting on the&#xD;
      following morning, subjects will then consume an orange drink (either OJ or a carbohydrate&#xD;
      matched orange flavoured drink) once a day for 12 wks. A 3-day diet diary for macronutrient&#xD;
      assessment will be recorded during wks 3,7and 11 of taking the drink, and measurements made&#xD;
      at screening will be repeated on visits 3 and 4 which will take place in weeks 4 and 8. A&#xD;
      standardized diet will be consumed for 3 days prior to the final laboratory visit, as before.&#xD;
      This 5th visit will be identical to visit 2.&#xD;
