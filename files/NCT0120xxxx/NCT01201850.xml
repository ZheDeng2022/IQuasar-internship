    <textblock>
      This study is being done to learn about the safety of the study drug bevacizumab(Avastin®),&#xD;
      when used to treat radiation necrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to test the feasibility of treating Central Nervous&#xD;
      System (CNS) tumor patients suffering from radiation necrosis with bevacizumab every 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate improvement in neurologic symptoms associated with bevacizumab as assessed&#xD;
           by clinical evaluation;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the neuro-imaging changes in radiation necrosis associated edema,&#xD;
           including Mass Resonance (MR) spectroscopy;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate changes in corticosteroid use in patients with radiation necrosis following&#xD;
           treatment with bevacizumab;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate changes in quality of life.&#xD;

      Treatment Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patient consented and enrolled on study, bevacizumab will be administered at a dose of 10&#xD;
      mg/kg IV every 2 weeks for a total of 6 doses (3 doses/cycle).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are expected to receive at least 1 cycle (6 weeks) of study treatment unless an&#xD;
      unacceptable drug reaction occurs. Patients will receive a second cycle of treatment as long&#xD;
      as treatment is tolerated. Response assessment will be performed every 6 weeks (three&#xD;
      doses/cycle of study drug) including clinical and radiological assessment. Secondary measures&#xD;
      including documentation of total equivalent steroid dose, length of time on steroids, and&#xD;
      quality of life using the modified McMaster Health Instrument scale will also be collected&#xD;
      while on treatment and 30 days after finishing treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be assessed by routine physical and laboratory evaluations. Adverse events will&#xD;
      be recorded and the severity graded according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for&#xD;
      Adverse Events (version 4.0).&#xD;

    <description>This pilot study was designed to evaluate the feasibility of treating pediatric patients with CNS radiation necrosis with bevacizumab. Patients enrolled on study were assessed for number of doses of bevacizumab that they received while on study. Participants who successfully received at least 5 of the 6 planned doses of bevacizumab (IV every 2 weeks) without significant events were determined to have met the outcome measure.</description>

    <description>Outcome 4: To investigate the neuro-imaging changes in radiation necrosis associated edema, including Mass Resonance (MR) spectroscopy; MRIs (including FLAIR sequences and contrast enhanced images) were evaluated for changes in the radiation necrosis imaging characteristics by a pediatric radiologist. Decreases in gadolinium enhancement, FLAIR signal were considered changes consistent with decreased edema. Tumor size was also evaluated, with a decrease in tumor size indicating decreased edema/improved radiation necrosis</description>
