    <textblock>
      Paracetamol overdose is the leading cause of acute liver failure in the Western World.&#xD;
      N-acetylcysteine (NAC) has been the antidote of choice for over 30 years but its use is&#xD;
      associated with adverse effects in 40% of cases. Patients characteristically experience&#xD;
      nausea, vomiting and an anaphylactoid ('pseudo-allergic') syndrome. This reaction is&#xD;
      clinically similar to true anaphylaxis (allergic reaction) including flushing, rash,&#xD;
      constriction of airways, and a fall in blood pressure, but occurs via a different mechanism.&#xD;
      Although treatable, these reactions lead to patient distress, commonly cause confusion among&#xD;
      treating physicians, and lead to significant delays in antidote administration. The aetiology&#xD;
      of these adverse reactions to NAC remains unclear. We hypothesise: i) these reactions result&#xD;
      from a dose-dependent release of the chemical histamine, causing dilatation of blood vessels&#xD;
      (vasodilatation) and the anaphylactoid syndrome; ii) paracetamol conversely exerts a&#xD;
      protective effect on the reaction, with a less severe reaction observed in the presence of&#xD;
      higher paracetamol concentrations. We will investigate the mechanisms underlying adverse&#xD;
      reactions to NAC in the human forearm model, examining the role of histamine and other&#xD;
      markers involved in the inflammatory process. The wider significance is an improved&#xD;
      understanding of this poorly delineated phenomenon, with implications for other medications&#xD;
      associated with similar reactions, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opioids&#xD;
      such as morphine.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators test the following hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. NAC causes dose-dependent vasodilatation associated with histamine release in vivo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Release of other mediators, known to be associated with anaphylaxis, does not occur&#xD;
           during anaphylactoid reactions to NAC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Paracetamol has a protective role against NAC adverse reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigation of these hypotheses in man is difficult. While local skin changes to&#xD;
      intradermal NAC have been used to examine dose-response in patients, this approach does not&#xD;
      lend itself to detailed investigation of the underlying mechanism and cannot be used to&#xD;
      explore the effect of high paracetamol concentrations. We propose to use an alternative&#xD;
      well-established model previously used by us to investigate the mechanisms involved in the&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics of morphine in man by the measurement of forearm blood flow and skin&#xD;
      response following intra-arterial infusion. The proposed model allows administration of doses&#xD;
      far smaller than those used systemically and thus minimises the risk of unwanted systemic&#xD;
      effects from either NAC or paracetamol. Safe administration of intra-arterial NAC (up to 300&#xD;
      mg/min, greater than that intended here) has previously been demonstrated. Local changes can&#xD;
      be used as a surrogate for systemic effects, as described previously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will take a structured 3-part approach to the research hypotheses. Studies 1 and 2 will&#xD;
      aim to establish a dose-response curve and seek evidence of tachyphylaxis, while measuring&#xD;
      the level of histamine release. The presence of tachyphylaxis may help to explain why, in the&#xD;
      clinical setting, NAC can often be safely re-introduced following a reaction. In study 3, the&#xD;
      investigators intend to conduct a 4-way randomised controlled crossover mechanistic study.&#xD;
      This will examine the pharmacodynamic effect of NAC in both the presence and absence of&#xD;
      histamine antagonists (antihistamines), and low- and high-dose paracetamol. This study will&#xD;
      also enable investigation of a possible protective role of paracetamol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all studies, the investigators will recruit healthy male volunteers between the ages of&#xD;
      18 and 64 years. Subjects will be non-smokers on no concomitant medications. Individuals with&#xD;
      clinically significant co-morbidity such as heart failure, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia,&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus, asthma, coagulopathy or bleeding disorders will be excluded. Exclusion&#xD;
      criteria will also include those individuals who have had recent infective or inflammatory&#xD;
      conditions or recently donated blood (within the last 3 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each study will be performed in a quiet, temperature-controlled room maintained at 22-24ÂºC&#xD;
      with subjects lying supine. Participants will have fasted and abstained from caffeine and&#xD;
      tobacco for at least 4 hours and from alcohol for 24 hours before each study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will undergo cannulation of the brachial artery in one arm with a sterile&#xD;
      27-standard wire gauge steel needle. Study drugs will be infused via this cannula. Blood will&#xD;
      be drawn from both the infused and control arms via 17-gauge venous cannulae inserted into&#xD;
      each arm under local anaesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a 30-min lead-in period, forearm blood flow will be measured at 6-10 minute intervals&#xD;
      in the infused and non-infused arms by venous occlusion plethysmography using&#xD;
      mercury-in-silastic strain gauges as described previously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects may be recruited to more than one study provided a minimum of 1 week has passed&#xD;
      between studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 1: Dose-response study Sufficient volunteers will be recruited to complete 8 studies&#xD;
      using an incremental rising dose infusion of intra-arterial NAC (6 doses) to determine a dose&#xD;
      response curve for arterial vasodilatation in the forearm. After a washout period of 30 mins&#xD;
      to ensure a return to normal state, this will be repeated to determine whether the response&#xD;
      is consistent over time. Study 1 will identify a dose to be used in study 2 that causes&#xD;
      maximum local forearm vasodilatation without systemic effects (rise in contralateral forearm&#xD;
      blood flow, blood pressure, heart rate, facial flushing).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that while an increase in histamine may be observed in response to NAC, no&#xD;
      change in the other mediators commonly associated with anaphylactic reactions will be&#xD;
      demonstrated. Blood samples will be obtained at baseline, at the end of the study, and at&#xD;
      10-min intervals during the incremental dose infusion of NAC to include each of the 6 doses&#xD;
      administered (total 14 occasions). To maximise efficiency in addressing our hypothesis we&#xD;
      intend to measure histamine and NAC at each time point. Enough blood will also be drawn on&#xD;
      each occasion for measurement of other potential inflammatory mediators, including tryptase,&#xD;
      vWF, tPA, IL-6, PGD2, and PGI2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 2: Acute tolerance study Acute tolerance will be investigated in study 2. Eight studies&#xD;
      will be completed using a constant infusion of NAC over 60 mins at a dose identified in study&#xD;
      1. Forearm vasodilatation and the level of histamine release will be measured every 10 mins.&#xD;
      This study may help to explain why in the clinical setting NAC can often be safely&#xD;
      reintroduced, without complication, following a reaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be obtained at baseline, at the end of the study, and at 10-min intervals&#xD;
      during the infusion of NAC (total 8 occasions). Histamine and NAC will be measured at each&#xD;
      time point and blood stored for later measurement of other potential mediators if appropriate&#xD;
      following the results of study 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 3: Mechanistic study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 3 is a 4-way randomised controlled crossover study to investigate potential mediators.&#xD;
      Sufficient subjects will be recruited to complete 8 studies, with each volunteer attending 4&#xD;
      times. At each visit, subjects will receive an increasing dose infusion of NAC as described&#xD;
      in study 1. In addition they will also receive one of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Co-infusion of normal saline (control)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Co-infusion of histamine antagonists (H1 and H2 antagonist)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Co-infusion of low dose paracetamol to give a local concentration of &lt;50 mg/l&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Co-infusion of higher dose paracetamol to give a local concentration of ~200 mg/l&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be obtained at baseline, at the end of the study, and at 10-min intervals&#xD;
      during the incremental dose infusion of NAC to include each of the 6 doses administered&#xD;
      (total 8 occasions). Histamine, NAC and paracetamol assays will be measured at all time&#xD;
      points. Blood will also be stored for later analysis of the other mediators if appropriate&#xD;
      according to the results of study 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drugs We have previously administered intra-arterial NAC without complication. Assuming a&#xD;
      forearm blood flow of 50 ml/min, an infusion of 25 mg/min would be expected to achieve a&#xD;
      local concentration ~500 mg/l, similar to peak concentrations reached during the standard&#xD;
      20-hour intravenous NAC protocol used on the hospital wards. We intend to use a range of 6&#xD;
      incremental doses at 10 min intervals to include this concentration: 1 mg/min, 5 mg/min, 10&#xD;
      mg/min, 50 mg/min, 100 mg/min, and 200 mg/min. The total infusion rate will be maintained 1&#xD;
      ml/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histamine antagonists in current clinical use have not yet been administered in intr-arterial&#xD;
      studies. We intend to use chlorphenamine (H1 antagonist) and ranitidine (H2 antagonist).&#xD;
      Intravenous (IV) administration of 10mg chlorphenamine results in a plasma concentration of&#xD;
      ~14 mcg/l. IA administration of 1 mcg/min would achieve a similar forearm concentration.&#xD;
      Assuming NAC causes vasodilatation with an increase in forearm blood flow, the investigators&#xD;
      propose to administer 5 mcg/min to ensure maximal H1 blockade. Similarly, IV administration&#xD;
      of 50mg ranitidine results in a plasma concentration of ~150 mcg/l. IA administration of 7.5&#xD;
      mcg/min would be expected to achieve a similar forearm concentration. In the presence of&#xD;
      increased forearm blood flow, the investigators propose to administer 37.5 mcg/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapeutic IV administration of 1g paracetamol results in a plasma concentration of ~12&#xD;
      mg/l. To achieve a desired concentration of ~25 mg/l, in the presence of a forearm blood blow&#xD;
      of 50 ml/min, the investigators would intend to administer an IA infusion of 1.25 mg/min. To&#xD;
      account for the presence of increased forearm blood flow, the investigators propose to&#xD;
      administer 4 mg/min IA paracetamol. To achieve a higher local PA concentration of ~200 mg/l,&#xD;
      a concentration comparable to potentially hepatotoxic concentrations following PA overdose,&#xD;
      the investigators propose to administer 30 mg/min PA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skin changes Skin changes will be assessed through assessment of erythema or oedema in the&#xD;
      forearm recorded using the Modified Draize Scale. Subjects will also be asked to subjectively&#xD;
      express the intensity of any itching on a scale of 1 (no itch) to 7 (intense itch).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expertise available The studies will be carried out in the Clinical Research Facility at the&#xD;
      Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, which has extensive experience in performing such studies. Most&#xD;
      of the assays will be undertaken in the University of Edinburgh laboratories, which have&#xD;
      expertise in these assays. The principal investigator is a trainee clinical toxicologist with&#xD;
      the necessary skills to undertake the research.&#xD;
