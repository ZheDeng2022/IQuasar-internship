    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to determine the effectiveness of a new treatment regime&#xD;
      that uses electrical stimulation for the improvement of hand function in persons with spinal&#xD;
      cord injuries (SCI). This treatment has been shown to be useful for stroke patients, and our&#xD;
      preliminary work indicates that this may also be the case with SCI patients. Our approach to&#xD;
      functional electrical stimulation (FES) represents a departure from the established FES&#xD;
      approaches, which involve developing assistive devices for permanent, everyday use. Instead,&#xD;
      we use FES as a therapeutic intervention that will help individuals with quadriplegia recover&#xD;
      voluntary grasping function. Investigators believe that subjects who undergo FES therapy&#xD;
      should be able to grasp objects without stimulation once the treatment program is completed.&#xD;

      The primary objective of the present prospective randomized controlled trial is to&#xD;
      investigate if the FES therapy would generate similar level of the improvement in hand&#xD;
      function in chronic C4 to C7 incomplete and complete SCI individuals as compared to&#xD;
      conventional occupational therapy. For the purpose of this study individuals with chronic SCI&#xD;
      are those who sustained injury at least 24 months prior to enrolling in the study. The FES or&#xD;
      conventional occupational therapy will be administered thrice-weekly for 13 weeks (i.e., 39&#xD;
      sessions in total) to 60 individuals with SCI. Half of the participants will receive the FES&#xD;
      therapy and the other half will receive conventional occupational therapy of equal intensity.&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to evaluate if the improvements in hand function will improve&#xD;
      participants' activities of daily living skills and their satisfaction with life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background and Significance The sudden onset of a traumatic SCI can result in severe&#xD;
      impairments in the motor and/or sensory functions of the body and limbs. A significant part&#xD;
      of the expenses incurred after SCI are associated with the need of many individuals with SCI&#xD;
      to have a caregiver assist them with various daily tasks such as eating, grooming and&#xD;
      ambulation. This dependence,besides being financially strenuous for the patients and their&#xD;
      families, frequently precipitates psychological problems such as depression, social&#xD;
      withdrawal and inactivity.For persons with quadriplegia, hand function is essential for&#xD;
      achieving a high level of independence in their activities of daily living. In a recent&#xD;
      survey, it was revealed that the majority of people with quadriplegia rate recovery of hand&#xD;
      function as the highest priority.FES is one of the most promising approaches towards&#xD;
      improving grasping function in SCI individuals with permanent hand impairment. A&#xD;
      neuroprosthesis for grasping is a device that can improve or restore the grasping, holding,&#xD;
      and releasing functions in persons with SCI [1]. The neuroprosthesis applies FES to&#xD;
      artificially generate a muscle contraction by applying short current pulses to motor nerves&#xD;
      innervating muscles. FES can be applied to individuals with SCI to help them restore&#xD;
      functions such as walking and grasping by contracting groups of paralyzed muscles in an&#xD;
      orchestrated manner.Despite the usefulness of neuroprostheses in improving functionality, SCI&#xD;
      consumers, their therapists and psychiatrists remain hesitant to use the technology. For&#xD;
      instance, Popovic et al. (not the principal investigator) reported that consumers who&#xD;
      retained some dexterity without an FES-assisted system hesitated to use the surface FES&#xD;
      device to manipulate small objects, even though they gained significant improvements in&#xD;
      function when wearing it. Also, some neuroprostheses such as the Freehand system require&#xD;
      invasive procedures for their implementation, which is often unappealing to SCI consumers.&#xD;
      These issues with FES, along with the mindset that impairments in functionality are&#xD;
      permanent, have led to the design of systems that SCI consumers have little interest in using&#xD;
      over long periods of time. Our application of the neuroprosthesis for grasping in this&#xD;
      proposal presents a departure from this standard and established approach of FES application.&#xD;
      The Compex Motion neuroprosthesis, developed by Drs. Popovic (principal investigator) and&#xD;
      Keller1,is a flexible device designed to improve grasping function in both SCI and stroke&#xD;
      patients. This multi-channel surface stimulation system for grasping provides both palmar and&#xD;
      lateral grasps, and holds a number of advantages over other existing neuroprostheses.Firstly,&#xD;
      whereas most other systems were designed and used exclusively as permanent orthotic systems&#xD;
      for SCI consumers in order to allow them to grasp, the Compex Motion was designed to help&#xD;
      retrain voluntary grasping function. Hence, the device is meant to be used as part of the&#xD;
      rehabilitation process towards improving functionality as opposed to merely substituting it.&#xD;
      Secondly, the Compex Motion is a surface FES system that does not require implanted systems&#xD;
      or possesses features that limit flexibility. These features make it a more suitable option&#xD;
      for rehabilitation applications, which typically require portable, flexible, non-invasive,&#xD;
      and multi-channel FES systems. Thirdly, although the Compex Motion, Handmaster, and Belgrade&#xD;
      Grasping-Reaching System have been used to retrain voluntary grasping function in individuals&#xD;
      with stroke, only the Compex Motion has been used for this purpose in individuals with SCI.&#xD;
      The advantages of the Compex Motion system over other FES systems is its potential for&#xD;
      retraining function in SCI patients and the fact that the system's application does not&#xD;
      require the long-term support/commitment of clinical and engineering specialists. Recent&#xD;
      innovative advances in FES applications, spearheaded by our team, clearly indicate that the&#xD;
      short-term, therapeutic intervention of the neuroprosthesis for grasping can enhance&#xD;
      voluntary function in individuals with SCI. These studies also suggest that this novel method&#xD;
      of applying FES to augment functional improvement has the potential to improve overall&#xD;
      physical and psychological well being of persons with SCI.&#xD;

    <description>The conventional therapy represents control activities against which FES therapy will be assessed. Conventional occupational therapy includes : a) muscle facilitation exercises emphasizing the neurodevelopmental treatment approach;b)task-specific repetitive functional training;c)strengthening and motor control training using resistance to available arm motion to increase strength; d)stretching exercises;e)electrical stimulation applied primarily for muscle strengthening (this is not FES); and f)activities of daily living including self care where the upper limb was used as an assist if appropriate; and caregiver training. Control and treatment group will have 3 sessions per week (business days only) for 13 to 16 weeks (40 treatment sessions in total). Each session will last 60 minutes.</description>
