  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary nodules are one of the most common thoracic radiographic abnormalities. They are&#xD;
      usually found accidentally as discrete well emarginated pulmonary lesions found within the&#xD;
      lung parenchyma during a routine chest x-ray. Pulmonary nodules are usually asymptomatic.&#xD;
      Most solitary lung nodules are benign; however these nodules can represent early stage lung&#xD;
      cancer. The identification of malignant pulmonary nodules is important because they represent&#xD;
      a potential form of curable lung malignancy. Every lung nodule should therefore be&#xD;
      investigated for the possibility of malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound has been beneficial in almost all medical and surgical specialities. The idea of&#xD;
      using ultrasound during VATS has emerged from its use in laparoscopic procedures. Few studies&#xD;
      have investigated the use intracavitary ultrasound for localizing pulmonary nodules. The&#xD;
      sensitivity of ultrasound detecting pulmonary nodules is high (92%). In some studies,&#xD;
      ultrasound could detect all pulmonary nodules detected by high resolution CT. It has also&#xD;
      been shown to be able to locate nodules not visualized on spiral CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of intracavitary ultrasound has been suggested by many authors as a safe and&#xD;
      effective method for localizing hard to find nodules. It is a real time technique with no&#xD;
      associated complications, low cost, and has the potential to save operative time. Most&#xD;
      importantly, it may be able to prevent conversion of VATS to open operations in cases where&#xD;
      nodules are not visualizable or locatable using VATS techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of intracavitary US as a localization method by surgeons intra-operatively could lead&#xD;
      to better identification of nodules. Also, this technique could avoid performing multiple&#xD;
      procedures on patients (CT guided targeting followed by surgery) and therefore is more&#xD;
      cost-efficient. If proven accurate, surgeon-performed intracavitary ultrasound could be used&#xD;
      routinely during VATS procedures, increasing the chances of finding and localizing pulmonary&#xD;
      nodules using minimally invasive techniques.&#xD;
