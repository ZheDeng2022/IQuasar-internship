  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this research is to understand the mechanisms underlying the development&#xD;
      of postural control in sitting using new methodology, in order to provide a scientific basis&#xD;
      for evaluation and treatment of posture and movement disorders in infants with cerebral&#xD;
      palsy. The development of early posture control remains poorly understood despite&#xD;
      considerable therapeutic effort. Infants with cerebral palsy show their first delays in the&#xD;
      acquisition of sitting, with subsequent problems developing adequate posture and movement&#xD;
      control. Identifying the delay, determining the nature of the problem, and evaluating the&#xD;
      effectiveness of treatment quickly, are vital in the early part of an infant's life, since&#xD;
      this is the time of greatest plasticity. Tools from nonlinear dynamics, which are&#xD;
      increasingly being used to examine other biological rhythms, are used in this study to&#xD;
      analyze postural sway from center of pressure data during the development of sitting postural&#xD;
      control.&#xD;

      Background: The ability to sit independently is fundamental for function but delayed in&#xD;
      infants with cerebral palsy (CP). Studies of intervention directed specifically toward&#xD;
      sitting in infants with CP have not been reported. Objective: Our purpose was to compare two&#xD;
      interventions for improving sitting postural control in infants with CP. Design: For this&#xD;
      randomized longitudinal study, infants under 2 years old and at risk for CP were recruited&#xD;
      for intervention directed toward sitting independence. Setting: The intervention was&#xD;
      conducted at home or at an outpatient facility. Patients: Fifteen typically developing&#xD;
      infants (5 months old, SD .5 months at entry) were followed longitudinally as a comparison&#xD;
      for postural variables. Thirty-five infants with delays in achieving sitting were recruited.&#xD;
      Infants with delays were randomly assigned to a home program (1x/week for 8 weeks; mean&#xD;
      age=15.5 months, SD=7 months), or a perceptual-motor intervention (2x/week for 8 weeks; mean&#xD;
      age=14.3 months, SD=3 months). Measurements: The primary outcome measure was Center of&#xD;
      Pressure (COP) data, from which linear and nonlinear variables were extracted. The Gross&#xD;
      Motor Function Measure (GMFM) sitting subsection was our clinical outcome measure. Results:&#xD;
      There was a main effect of time in the GMFM sitting subscale and in two of the COP variables.&#xD;
      Interaction of group by time factors indicated significant differences between intervention&#xD;
      groups on two COP measures, in favor of the group with perceptual-motor intervention.&#xD;
      Limitations: The small number of infants limits the ability to generalize the findings.&#xD;
      Conclusions: Although both groups made progress in the GMFM, the COP measures indicated an&#xD;
      advantage for the group with perceptual-motor intervention. The COP measures appear sensitive&#xD;
      for assessment of infant posture control and quantifying intervention response.&#xD;
