  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the need for cognitive rehabilitation, there is a paucity of well-designed research&#xD;
      studies to investigate treatment approaches or their effectiveness in MS. Most of published&#xD;
      studies suffer from significant methodological flaws including small sample size, short&#xD;
      follow-up periods, and lack of specific outcome criteria to determine improvement. O'Brien et&#xD;
      al. (2008) recently reviewed 16 studies of cognitive rehabilitation designed to persons with&#xD;
      MS and found only 4 class I studies and only one class I study of rehabilitation of attention&#xD;
      deficits. Methodologically rigorous research is needed to confirm the preliminary results&#xD;
      reported by these studies and determine the effectiveness and efficacy of cognitive&#xD;
      rehabilitation interventions in attention deficits in MS. O'Brien et al. listed limitations&#xD;
      found in previous studies that must be addressed in future studies. The present study was&#xD;
      designed according to these recommendations. It is a randomized, controlled study, in&#xD;
      parallel groups, evaluator blinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of participants: 25 RRMS patients in the active group, 25 RRMS patients in the control&#xD;
      group and 25 healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol will be proposed to RRMS patients AFFILIATED TO FRENCH SOCIAL SECURITY referred&#xD;
      to the investigators center by practicing neurologists and fulfilling the inclusion criteria&#xD;
      for screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomised between two groups. The active group (25 patients) will be&#xD;
      treated by rehabilitation. Individual rehabilitation procedures will be focused on attention,&#xD;
      executive functions and IPS. The program will be tailored to each patient cognitive status&#xD;
      depending on the impairments identified during the initial assessment while maintaining a&#xD;
      systematic work on attention and executive functions. A total of 50 sessions lasting one hour&#xD;
      at a rate of 3 sessions per week for a total period of 4 months will be proposed. Patients&#xD;
      randomized in the other group will participate to group session every week without specific&#xD;
      cognitive rehabilitation. 25 healthy control subjects (group C), matched to patients for&#xD;
      education, gender and age with patients of groups A/B will have the same evaluation&#xD;
      procedures than patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation will be performed at baseline, after 4 months (end of treatment period) and after&#xD;
      8 months. Evaluation will include clinical testing, cognitive battery (paper/pencil and&#xD;
      computer tests), cognitive ecological evaluation (Computer test of attention in a virtual&#xD;
      reality environment and driving test on a driving simulator), questionnaires about daily life&#xD;
      and MRI (fMRI and MRI). All patients and healthy subjects will undergo the fMRI protocol&#xD;
      using a paradigm previously published by the investigators group (Bonnet et al., 2009):&#xD;
      Go/No-go paradigm with increasing difficulty during four successive conditions (the Tonic&#xD;
      Alertness task, Go/No-go (IG), reversal Go/No-go (RG), and complex Go/No-go (CG). In a&#xD;
      previous study the investigators observed compensatory activation in MS patients as compared&#xD;
      to healthy controls for the three first conditions and a saturation of compensatory processes&#xD;
      for the more complex. In the present study, the investigators hypothesize that a similar&#xD;
      pattern will occur at baseline and that cognitive rehabilitation will improve brain&#xD;
      compensation at the fourth level of complexity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      : Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is the most frequent disabling neurological disease in young&#xD;
      adults. Over the past two decades, cognitive impairment in MS has received increasing&#xD;
      interest. Although for a long time described in MS text books, it has been underestimated&#xD;
      until recently. It is now accepted as an important feature of MS with a high impact on&#xD;
      working and social abilities. The cognitive disorders in MS are dominated by a slowdown in&#xD;
      information processing speed (IPS), as well as disturbances of attention and memory. The&#xD;
      nature of cognitive findings suggest that the impairments depend on the integrity of&#xD;
      large-scale cortical integrative processes, which involve long-distance white matter&#xD;
      projections which can be impaired due to diffuse demyelinating injury in patients with MS. At&#xD;
      the early stages of MS there is increasing evidence that neuroplasticity, the ability of the&#xD;
      brain to respond to various insults, allows adaptive reorganization of cognitive functions to&#xD;
      limit impairment, despite widespread tissue damage. Recently, we showed that at the early&#xD;
      stages of RRMS compensatory capacities are relatively maintained, especially in&#xD;
      highly-educated patients suggesting that cognitive training might be useful. The requirement&#xD;
      of cerebral compensatory mechanisms to perform the cognitive tests was postulated in MS&#xD;
      patients on the basis of functional MRI (fMRI) studies. By using a go/no go task of&#xD;
      increasing complexity in a fMRI study in RRMS patients, we observed that a limitation of this&#xD;
      compensatory cerebral recruitment appears when the attentional solicitations reach a&#xD;
      particular level of difficulty. We postulate that a cognitive training program may help to&#xD;
      maintain these compensatory capacities. Therefore, we propose to evaluate the effect of the&#xD;
      program on brain activation using a task with several levels of attention requirement&#xD;
      (increased attention load) by using fMRI and to evaluate in parallel its clinical effect and&#xD;
      its impact in daily activities.&#xD;
