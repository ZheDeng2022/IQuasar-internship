  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The right to food and nutrition is established in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights&#xD;
      as they are basic requirements for promoting and protecting good health. They can also be&#xD;
      instruments to evaluate the quality of life of human beings and communities. Awareness of a&#xD;
      healthy diet is the first step in behavioral change, and nutritional education can be an&#xD;
      instrument for avoiding diseases resulting from both intake deficit and excess. Educational&#xD;
      group actions can change food intake. This study will aim at evaluating, planning and&#xD;
      implementing the impact of a nutritional education group action concerning the consumption of&#xD;
      fruit and vegetables in adult and elderly individuals attended to by a Primary Health Care&#xD;
      (PHCU) Unit. It will be a randomized assay involving two groups comprising male and females&#xD;
      individuals distributed in the following fashion: Intervention Group, in which the&#xD;
      educational group action (EGA) will be performed in addition to routine activities; and&#xD;
      Control Group, the individuals from which will only participate in the routine activities in&#xD;
      the PHCA (Teaching Health Care Unit). The total sample will comprise 80 individuals with 40&#xD;
      in each group. In order to determine the consumption of fruit and vegetables, a weekday and a&#xD;
      Sunday 24-hour recalls will be performed 2 (short-term effects) and 6 (medium-term effects)&#xD;
      months after completing the intervention. The educational group activities will consist of&#xD;
      two-hour group dynamics and cooking workshops once a week and for five weeks. Serum&#xD;
      carotenoid dosages will also be performed in the two groups by sub-sampling (n=40) with the&#xD;
      purpose to validate the estimated intake of fruit and vegetables obtained from the recalls.&#xD;
