      The purpose of this study is to describe the safety and tolerability of single and repeat&#xD;
      oral doses of GSK1440115 in healthy volunteers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is the first administration of GSK1440115 to humans. GSK1440115 is a urotensin II&#xD;
      receptor antagonist which is being developed for the treatment of asthma. This will be a&#xD;
      two-part study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of single (Part A)&#xD;
      and repeat (Part B) oral doses of GSK1440115 in healthy adult male and female (of non-child&#xD;
      bearing potential) subjects. This study will be a randomized, single-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, dose escalation design. Part A will evaluate a single dose of GSK1440115.&#xD;
      Part B will evaluate repeat daily doses for 7 days.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Healthy as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical&#xD;
             evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and&#xD;
             cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters&#xD;
             outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if&#xD;
             the Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to&#xD;
             introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Male or female between 18 and 65 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the&#xD;
             informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of:&#xD;
&#xD;
             - Non-childbearing potential defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal&#xD;
             ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous&#xD;
             amenorrhea [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle&#xD;
             stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 MlU/ml and estradiol &lt; 40 pg/ml (&lt;147 pmol/L) is&#xD;
             confirmatory]. [Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal&#xD;
             status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception methods in Section&#xD;
             8.1 if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must&#xD;
             discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal status prior to study&#xD;
             enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2-4 weeks will elapse between the&#xD;
             cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage&#xD;
             of HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal status, they can resume use of&#xD;
             HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive method.]&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Male subjects with female partners of child-bearing potential must agree to use one of&#xD;
             the contraception methods listed in Section 8.1. This criterion must be followed from&#xD;
             the time of the first dose of study drug until completion of the Follow-up Period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the&#xD;
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5xULN (isolated&#xD;
             bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin&#xD;
             &lt;35%).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. QTcB or QTcF &lt; 450 msec; or QTc &lt; 480 msec in subjects with Bundle Branch Block.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. A positive pre-study Hepatitis B surface antigen or positive Hepatitis C antibody&#xD;
             result within 3 months of Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities&#xD;
             (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. A positive pre-study drug/alcohol screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. A positive test for HIV antibody.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Average systolic blood pressure of &lt; 100 mmHg at Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. History of regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of the study defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
             - an average weekly intake of &gt;21 units for males or &gt;14 units for females. One unit&#xD;
             is equivalent to 8 g of alcohol: a half-pint (~240 ml) of beer, 1 glass (125 ml) of&#xD;
             wine or 1 (25 ml) measure of spirits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational&#xD;
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current&#xD;
             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the&#xD;
             investigational product (whichever is longer).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Use of prescription or non-prescription medications, vitamins, and dietary or herbal&#xD;
             supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days (or 14 days if the medication is&#xD;
             a potential enzyme inducer) or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first&#xD;
             dose of study drug, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and GSK Medical Monitor&#xD;
             the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise subject&#xD;
             safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a&#xD;
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the Investigator or GSK&#xD;
             Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products&#xD;
             in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day period.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Pregnant females as determined by positive serum or urine hCG test at Screening or&#xD;
             prior to dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Lactating females.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Unwillingness or inability to follow the procedures outlined in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Subject is mentally or legally incapacitated.&#xD;
