  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At this time, 24h energy expenditure is rarely assessed under free-living conditions for&#xD;
      specific individuals because of the lack of cheap and accurate software/materials to record&#xD;
      the energy expenditure. Some affordable and convenient tools (Polar heart rate monitor,&#xD;
      Actiheart, SenseWear Armband) are available on the market but the predictive equations&#xD;
      comprised into the software provided with these tools generally miscalculate the energy&#xD;
      expenditure (by about +/-10%). Because of this deficiency, the investigators have a poor&#xD;
      knowledge of the modification of the energy expended during daily life activities and over&#xD;
      24h in subjects belonging to groups of various ages and physiological states. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesise that it could be possible to improve the energy expenditure&#xD;
      prediction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project aims at providing a mathematical model (equations) that predicts energy&#xD;
      expenditure with an error near to 5%. Two groups of 60 sedentary to athletic normal weight&#xD;
      volunteers aged between 18-60 years participate to this study. The first group stay for 26h&#xD;
      in calorimetric chambers. During this stay energy expenditure ,heart rate, accelerometry, and&#xD;
      other parameters are recorded during various activities. These data will serve to construct&#xD;
      the model. The same type of recordings are performed on second group of volunteers in free&#xD;
      living conditions. Their energy expenditure is measured overall by doubly labeled water. The&#xD;
      data of the second group will serve to validate the model. The error percentage of the model&#xD;
      is defined by the ratio of the value of the difference between prediction and reference&#xD;
      measure to the reference measure. Concordance between predictions and measures will be&#xD;
      evaluated by Bland - Altman plots.&#xD;

      All the volunteers have a visit of inclusion in the Centre de Recherche en Nutrition Humaine.&#xD;
      During this visit, the volunteers are informed of the methods of the protocol, the taking of&#xD;
      samples, the disadvantages and constraints, on the basis of information letter. They have a&#xD;
      medical interrogation and a complete clinical examination by an investigatory doctor or&#xD;
      Co-investigator. The biological assessment is requiring 10 ml of blood and including: the&#xD;
      analysis of the TSH, a blood count, a sedimentation test. Moreover, for the women in age to&#xD;
      procreate, the analysis of the beta - HCG is made. To take another blood sample (10 ml) is&#xD;
      necessary for the realization of serology HIV/HCV in the volunteers of the group of doubly&#xD;
      labeled water, who provide samples of urine and saliva. The results are communicated to the&#xD;
      volunteers confidentially.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the visit of inclusion and the signature of the consent form, a food consumption&#xD;
      survey is performed to evaluate the energy intakes of the volunteers. Moreover, the body&#xD;
      composition and the level of physical-activity of the volunteers are evaluated by biphotonic&#xD;
      absorptiometry (DEXA) and using questionnaire MAQ (Modifiable Activity Questionnaire,&#xD;
      translated and adapted by Vuillemin and Al, 1999), respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The volunteers of the first group (60) performed a maximal aerobic power test on ergocycle to&#xD;
      evaluate their maximum aerobic physical capacity (VO2max), in a hospital laboratory. A&#xD;
      measurement of the body composition by biphotonic absorptiometry is also carried out to&#xD;
      determine their lean and fat mass. Then, the volunteers stay 26 hours in calorimetric rooms&#xD;
      (one evening, one night and a day). The data of indirect calorimetry (O2 consumption and&#xD;
      production of CO2), heart rate , actimetry and other parameters are taken into account as&#xD;
      from midnight. After one night of sleep, the individuals have to carry out series of state or&#xD;
      exercises simulating the daily physical-activities (sleeping, writing 15 min,&#xD;
      standing-sitting 5 min, standing 15 min, strolling 15 min, rest 20 min, eating 20 min,&#xD;
      household 20 min, stepper 20 min, walking on treadmill at increasing speed 3 km/h, 4 km/h, 5&#xD;
      km/h and 6 km/h during 20 minutes). The volunteers have also to answer questionnaires on&#xD;
      their perception of hunger, their emotional state and their visual appreciation of 6 food&#xD;
      products at 5 times of the day (before and after the breakfast, before and after the lunch&#xD;
      and about 16:30 pm). The rest of the time, their activities are free (watching TV, reading,&#xD;
      listening radio â€¦). Measurements finish towards 18:00 and volunteers go home. The meals are&#xD;
      balanced in proteins/glucides/lipids and cover energy needs. The menus are established by the&#xD;
      dieticians. The meals in calorimetric room are prepared in double weighing to make it&#xD;
      possible to calculate the actual quantities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second group of volunteers (60) follow the protocol of doubly labeled water to evaluate&#xD;
      their energy expenditure during 10 days in free living conditions. For this period, their&#xD;
      heart rate, parameters of actimetry and other parameters are recorded . The participants of&#xD;
      this second group also answer the questionnaires of perception of hunger, emotional state and&#xD;
      visual appreciation of 6 food products, over one day at home. The physical data recorded on&#xD;
      this second group will be introduced into the predictive equations. The estimated energy&#xD;
      expenditure will be compared with the energy expenditure measured by the technique of doubly&#xD;
      labeled water. The answers to the questionnaires filled out by the volunteers of the two&#xD;
      groups will be also compared.&#xD;
