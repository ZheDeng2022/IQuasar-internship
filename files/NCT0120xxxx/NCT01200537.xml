    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to compare the efficacy and effect of&#xD;
      luteal estradiol and combined oral contraceptive pills (COPC) on follicle recruitment and&#xD;
      synchrony in a poor responder population. The randomized groups consist of: 1. patients&#xD;
      receiving luteal estradiol prior to ovulation induction; and 2. patients receiving COCPs for&#xD;
      1 month prior to ovulation induction. Follicle characteristics and serum biomarkers will be&#xD;
      followed and compared in each group. Coefficient of variation will be used to evaluate&#xD;
      follicle size discrepancy. Chi square analysis will be used to compare categorical variables&#xD;
      between treatment groups. Both estradiol and COPCs are used clinically in assisted&#xD;
      reproduction, so this study affords no additional risks to the participants.&#xD;

      1. Protocol Title:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Optimizing ovulation induction in the poor responder: a randomized controlled trial of&#xD;
           luteal phase estradiol verses combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP) on ovarian&#xD;
           morphology and biomarkers prior to ovulation induction&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Purpose of the Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
           In women undergoing ovulation induction who are at high risk for poor response, we&#xD;
           hypothesize that:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Null Hypothesis: Mean follicular diameter and coefficient of variation between follicles&#xD;
           in patients receiving luteal COCP are statistically equal to follicular diameters and&#xD;
           coefficient of variation between follicles in patients receiving estradiol. To test this&#xD;
           hypothesis, the specific aims of the present proposal are:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Aim 1: Compare the effect of luteal estradiol and COCP pretreatment on follicle&#xD;
           synchrony. Mean follicular diameter and the coefficient of variation between follicle&#xD;
           measurements will be calculated on cycle day 3 the cycle before and during treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Aim 2: Compare the effect of luteal estradiol and COCP pretreatment on follicle&#xD;
           recruitment. Markers of follicle recruitment will be measured on cycle day 3 before and&#xD;
           during the treatment cycle. Previously identified follicle recruitment markers that&#xD;
           positively correlate with follicle recruitment include: antral follicle count (AFC), AMH&#xD;
           and androstenedione.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Aim 3: Compare the efficacy of luteal estradiol and COCP. The number of mature follicles&#xD;
           greater than or equal to 14 mm on day of hCG and pregnancy outcomes will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The two treatment groups are:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Group 1: Luteal estradiol administration prior to ovulation induction management&#xD;
                per patient's primary physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Group 2: COCP administration for one month prior to ovulation induction management&#xD;
                per patient's primary physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Upon completion, we will have compared follicular and biochemical ovarian response to&#xD;
           luteal estradiol and COCPs in poor responders undergoing ovulation induction. The future&#xD;
           implications of this study are development of clinical strategies for treating patients&#xD;
           at high risk of poor response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Background &amp; Significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Ten percent of the United States population, 6.2 million women and their partners,&#xD;
           reported infertility in the 1995 National Survey of Family Growth. The number of couples&#xD;
           affected by infertility is predicted to increase to 6.5 million by the year 2025.' Among&#xD;
           women seeking infertility treatment, a subset will be classified as poor responders due&#xD;
           to poor ovarian response to treatment. Though the definition of poor response to&#xD;
           treatment is not standardized, studies estimate that 4-26% of patients undergoing&#xD;
           treatment are affected.2 The proportion of women classified as poor responders may&#xD;
           increase as more women delay fertility until an age of decreased fecundity due to&#xD;
           declining ovarian reserve. Establishing effective treatments for poor responders is&#xD;
           therefore imperative.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The principal goal of ovulation induction in infertile patients with regular menstrual&#xD;
           cycles is to achieve two to three mature synchronous follicles to maximize chance of&#xD;
           pregnancy and minimize risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. Poor responders, by&#xD;
           definition, have a lower likelihood of sufficient follicular recruitment. Lesser&#xD;
           recruitment can be compounded by follicular dysynchrony that necessitates human&#xD;
           chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) administration based on larger follicles when lagging&#xD;
           smaller follicles are less likely to be mature. Follicular dysynchrony can be compounded&#xD;
           by the rise in follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) in the luteal phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Fanchin et al has demonstrated that luteal estradiol administration suppresses luteal&#xD;
           FSH rise, reduces antral follicle size, and synchronizes the follicular cohort.3,4,5,6&#xD;
           Luteal estradiol and GnRH antagonist administration prior to controlled ovarian&#xD;
           hyperstimulation for in vitro fertilization (IVF) have been shown to decrease&#xD;
           cancellation rate, increase mean number of oocytes retrieved, and improve fertilization&#xD;
           rates in poor responders (retrospective study using historic controls presented in&#xD;
           abstract form).7 Estradiol has also been used in patients with hypergonadotrophic&#xD;
           amenorrhea to suppress elevated endogenous LH and FSH prior to stimulation with&#xD;
           exogenous gonadotropins with modest success in achieving ovulation and, in rare cases,&#xD;
           pregnancy.8&#xD;
&#xD;
           Combined oral contraceptive pills (COCPs) administered prior to ovulation induction in&#xD;
           IVF increase the number of oocytes retrieved and suppress cyst formation.9,10,11 In a&#xD;
           small study of poor responders undergoing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation for IVF,&#xD;
           pretreatment with COCPs was associated with increased pregnancy rates compared to&#xD;
           pretreatment with luteal phase gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist (GnRH-a),&#xD;
           follicular phase GnRH-a, and no pretreatment.12 COCPs prior to ovulation induction with&#xD;
           microdoses of GnRHa and gonadotropins enhance ovarian responsiveness in poor responders&#xD;
           resulting in higher peak estradiol (E2) levels, more mature follicles, and larger number&#xD;
           of retrieved oocytes when compared with traditional luteal GnRH-a downregulation&#xD;
           followed by gonadotropin stimulation.13 Follicular GnRH-a administration releases&#xD;
           endogenous gonadotropins producing a gonadotropin &quot;flare&quot; effect. Smaller, more frequent&#xD;
           &quot;microdosing&quot; of GnRH-a minimizes endogenous FSH suppression while preventing premature&#xD;
           luteinizing hormone (LH) surges. Oral contraceptive pretreatment prevents formation of a&#xD;
           corpus luteum that could produce progesterone prematurely during the flare. This&#xD;
           protocol with the addition of growth hormone (GH) has been shown to produce a 50%&#xD;
           ongoing pregnancy rate (PR) when used in patients who had prior ovulation induction&#xD;
           cycles using luteal phase GnRH-a suppression followed by exogenous gonadotropins and GH&#xD;
           cancelled due to poor response.14&#xD;
&#xD;
           While both COCPs and luteal estradiol suppress the luteal rise in FSH and synchronize&#xD;
           follicles, they have not been compared against each other. COCPs, with progestin in&#xD;
           addition to estrogen, may achieve better suppression of luteal FSH than estradiol and&#xD;
           result in better synchronization of the follicles. COCPs, however, have been used to&#xD;
           decrease ovarian responsiveness in patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome who are at&#xD;
           increased risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.15 Therefore, COCPs may suppress&#xD;
           ovarian responsiveness more than luteal estradiol, an unwanted effect in the poor&#xD;
           responder population. One potential mechanism for greater ovarian suppression with COCPs&#xD;
           may be the decrease in androstenedione, a marker shown to be positively correlated with&#xD;
           total and mature oocyte number obtained during IVF, 16 subsequent to the COCP-induced&#xD;
           increase in sex hormone binding globulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Previously identified follicle recruitment markers include antral follicle count (AFC)&#xD;
           and androstenedione which positively correlate with follicle recruitment.16 AFC is a&#xD;
           reproducible predictor of follicular recruitment which has been shown to positively&#xD;
           correlate with number of oocytes retrieved and IVF pregnancy outcome.18,19, 20 AFC&#xD;
           measurements are stable throughout the ovarian cycle and before and after GnRH&#xD;
           downregulation.21&#xD;
&#xD;
           AMH may serve as a biomarker for both follicle quantity and quality since both serum and&#xD;
           intrafollicular AMH positively correlate with AFC and number of eggs retrieved during&#xD;
           IVF.22 The mid-luteal AMH rise may reflect luteal follicle development;23 both estradiol&#xD;
           and COCP may affect luteal follicle development therefore CD3 AMH levels before and&#xD;
           after treatment will be of great interest. AMH also exhibits superior cycle to cycle&#xD;
           reproducibility when compared to FSH, E2, inhibin Band AFC.24&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Design &amp; Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pretreatment Evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline studies preceding ovulation induction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cycle day 3 FSH, inhibin B, estradiol, androstenedione, AMH, and AFC will be performed the&#xD;
      cycle of OCP or luteal pretreatment and the cycle of ovulation induction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transvaginal ultrasound:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Ovarian morphology and dimensions will be obtained using a vaginal probe ultrasound. All&#xD;
      study ultrasounds will be recorded and read by a single investigator (at each center) blinded&#xD;
      to patient treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ovarian volume will be calculated using the formula for a prolate ellipsoid&#xD;
           (0.5237xD1xD2xD3; D1, D2, and D3 are the maximal longitudinal anteroposterior and&#xD;
           transverse diameters, respectively).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ovarian volume will also be calculated using the VOCAL (volume calculation) GE software&#xD;
           package on the Voluson ultrasound machine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Antral follicles will be counted, measured in two dimensions and averaged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood sampling:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood samples will be used to measure FSH, inhibin B, estradiol, androstenedione, AMH,&#xD;
           and progesterone during the cycle prior to and of ovarian stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estradiol, FSH, progesterone, inhibin B, androstenedione, and AMH will be transported&#xD;
           to, stored and measured in batches at Dr. Sarah Berga's Emory University research&#xD;
           laboratory, Duke Fertility Center or the Duke Unievrsity Hospital core laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Registration/Randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
      Block randomization will occur by computer algorithm to two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1: Luteal estradiol&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2: COCP&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Ovarian stimulation for ovulation induction:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Group 1: Luteal estradiol • Starting cycle day 20, two 0.1 mg/d transdermal estradiol&#xD;
           patch will be applied every other day until cycle day 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients will present for baseline ultrasound, AFC, FSH, inhibin B, estradiol,&#xD;
                progesterone, androstenedione, and AMH measurement on cycle day 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Starting on cycle day 3, ovarian stimulation will begin. The treatment protocol for&#xD;
                ovulation induction will be determined by the patient's primary physician and the&#xD;
                clinician monitoring the cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Group 2: Combined oral contraceptive&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Patients will begin COCP administration on the cycle day one of the cycle prior to&#xD;
           ovarian stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Patients will present for baseline ultrasound, AFC, FSH, inhibin B, estradiol,&#xD;
           progesterone, androstenedione, and AMH measurement on cycle day 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Starting on cycle day 3, ovarian stimulation will begin. The treatment protocol for&#xD;
           ovulation induction will be determined by the patient's primary physician and the&#xD;
           clinician monitoring the cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All participants will be monitored by serum E2 levels and TVUS as determined by the&#xD;
           patient's primary physician to assess the rise in circulating estrogen levels and&#xD;
           follicular maturation. Follicles will be measured in two dimensions and the average&#xD;
           recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The mode of ovulation trigger, and IUI or IVF will be at the discretion of the patient's&#xD;
           primary physician and the clinician monitoring the cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patient Assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients will return 14 days after IUI or IVF for serum beta hCG testing. In the event&#xD;
           of a negative pregnancy test, patients will be given the option of crossing over to the&#xD;
           other treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
           6. Subject Recruitment &amp; Compensation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Please see section #5. There will be no patient compensation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7. Consent Process:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An IRB-approved written informed consent will be obtained from each subject at entry into the&#xD;
      study; elements of informed consent will include: (a) having the subject review the study&#xD;
      consent form; (b) having the investigator(s) or study staff meet with the subject to review&#xD;
      the consent, confirm understanding, and answer any questions; and (c) once the&#xD;
      investigator(s) or study staff are convinced that the protocol is understood and that there&#xD;
      is agreement to participate, having the consent signed in the presence of a witness. The&#xD;
      potential participant will have until the beginning of her first stimulated cycle to decide&#xD;
      whether or not she is participating in the study. The consent will be discussed and signed in&#xD;
      person at Emory Reproductive Center or Duke Fertility Center. The consent process, as&#xD;
      outlined above, will occur in private consultation rooms. There is no time minimum or maximum&#xD;
      for the consent process. The consent process is determined to be complete when the&#xD;
      participant verbalizes understanding, states that she has no further questions and signs the&#xD;
      consent forms. The PI, Co-PI, Co-Investigators and coordinating research nurse will be&#xD;
      readily available by telephone or in person at ERC and/or DFC to answer questions concerning&#xD;
      the consent. In order to reduce potential coercion and perceived influence by the study&#xD;
      personnel, the study details and consent forms will be discussed in a matter-of-fact and&#xD;
      consistent manner. Only patients who speak and read English will be admitted into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8. Subject's Capacity to Give Legally Effective Consent:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only patients with the capacity to give legally effective consent will be included in the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9. Study Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Please see section #4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10. Risk/Benefit Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatments used in this study have been studied individually and are used in clinical&#xD;
      practice. Our goal is to see which one is better. Therefore the risks of this study are the&#xD;
      same as the risk of ovulation induction to which the subjects will be exposed whether they&#xD;
      are enrolled in the study or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      11. Costs to the Subject:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no additional cost to the subject above the regular fees assessed for ART.&#xD;
&#xD;
      12. Data Analysis &amp; Statistical Considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coefficient of variation will be used to evaluate follicular size discrepancy by the&#xD;
      following formula: Coefficient of variation = 100 * Standard deviation / mean of the set&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size&#xD;
&#xD;
      We predict that a difference of 1.2 mm between mean follicular size before and after COCPs&#xD;
      will be clinically significant. This is based on observations by Fanchin in which women&#xD;
      treated with luteal estradiol displayed a decrease in mean follicular size on day 3 of 1.2 mm&#xD;
      that was associated with a significant decrease in coefficient of variation between follicles&#xD;
      and an increase in mature follicles &gt;16 mm number on day of hCG administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power to detect a difference between groups Number cycles/group to demonstrate COCP&#xD;
      equivalence Number cycles/group to demonstrate COCP superiority 80% 7 25 85% 7 29 90% 9 33&#xD;
      95% 11 41&#xD;
&#xD;
      To detect equivalence of COCP to luteal estradiol with a power of 90% at an alpha of .05&#xD;
      assuming a 10% attrition rate, we will enroll women into each study group so as to achieve&#xD;
      final number of 10 cycles per treatment group. We assume that an additional 50% decrease in&#xD;
      follicular size would prove COCP superiority. To detect superiority of COCP to luteal&#xD;
      estradiol with a power of 80% at an alpha of 0.05 assuming 10% attrition rate, we will enroll&#xD;
      women into each study group so as to achieve a final number of 28 cycles per treatment group.&#xD;
      Only newly initiated treatment cycles will be included; only the first cycle of patients'&#xD;
      crossing over to the other treatment group will count toward this recruitment goal. The&#xD;
      second cross over cycle will be compared within patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      µ1-µ 2 = 4.9 - 3.7 mm = 1.2 (µ1-µ 2)2 = 1.44 (COCP equivalence) µ1-µ 2 = 1.8 - 1.2 mm = 0.6&#xD;

&#xD;
      Calculation: n= (Zα +Zβ)2* 2(б2) / (µ1-µ 2)2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods of Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chi square analysis will be used to compare categorical variables between treatment groups.&#xD;
      Student's t test will be used to compare the mean follicle measurements between treatment&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      13. Data &amp; Safety Monitoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adherence and Monitoirng Statement: The Data Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP) outlined below&#xD;
      will adhere to the protocol approved by the IRB at both Emory University School of Medicine&#xD;
      and Duke University School of Medicine. The Principal investigator (PI) will review all data&#xD;
      collection forms at least annually for completeness and accuracy of the data as well as&#xD;
      protocol compliance. The PI will review this protocol on a continuing basis for subject&#xD;
      safety and include the results of the review in annual progress reports submitted to the IRB.&#xD;
      Adverse events and serious adverse events will also be reviewed by the PI weekly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Monitoring: Performed by the P.I., the Co-P.I. and/or Co Investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient safety data examination, monitoring procedures/oversight: All adverse events (AEs)&#xD;
      will be graded as to their attribution (unrelated to protocol, or possibly, probably, or&#xD;
      definitely related to protocol). Any AE that is reported to either the PI or her designated&#xD;
      research associates by a study subject or by medical staff caring for the subject and which&#xD;
      meets the criteria will be documented as such.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serious adverse events (SAEs) are predefined as any experience that suggests a significant&#xD;
      hazard, such as events which: a) are fatal, b) are life threatening, c) result in permanent&#xD;
      disability, d) require inpatient hospitalization, or e) involve cancer, a congenital anomaly,&#xD;
      or drug overdose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any AEs will be reported to the IRB at Emory and Duke within 24-48 hours of the event. The&#xD;
      standard Emory and Duke IRB reporting guidelines for AE and SAE reporting will be followed.&#xD;
      The investigators and staff will evaluate the SAEs in close coordination with the Emory and&#xD;
      Duke IRB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected adverse events are detailed in the Consent Form and include the following: side&#xD;
      effects of estradiol and combined oral contraceptive pills (breakthrough bleeding, nausea,&#xD;
      headaches, depression, breast tenderness, changes in blood pressure, and increase in risk of&#xD;
      blood clotting); risks of ovulation induction (multiple birth, ovarian hyperstimulation&#xD;
      syndrome, ovarian cyst development, failure to achieve pregnancy); risks of multiple birth&#xD;
      and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome are less in poor responders regardless of treatment&#xD;
      used; risk of failure to achieve pregnancy is greater in poor responders regardless of&#xD;
      treatment used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures for minimizing risks: Monitoring with serial ultrasound and blood work will be&#xD;
      used to minimize risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plans for transmission of temporary or permanent suspension actions: Any actions that mandate&#xD;
      temporary or permanent suspension of study will be transmitted to the Emory and Duke IRB,&#xD;
      and, if appropriate, to the FDA and the National Institutes of Health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plans for assuring data accuracy and protocol human safety compliance: The above detailed&#xD;
      plans should assure data accuracy and protocol human safety compliance. These include&#xD;
      computerized database management, and IRB oversight and communication. This plan, together&#xD;
      with proposed monitoring by the IRB, should be sufficient without the addition of more&#xD;
      faculty members to constitute a DSMB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      14. Privacy, Data Storage &amp; Confidentiality:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All information and materials will be obtained for research purposes only and the data will&#xD;
      be kept in strict confidence. Confidentiality will be assured by the use of subject codes&#xD;
      rather than personal identifiers. The study database will be secured, and information will&#xD;
      only be entered using subject identifier codes rather than personal identifiers. Electronic&#xD;
      communication will involve only coded, unidentifiable information. All adverse event reports&#xD;
      and annual summaries will not include subject-identifiable material.&#xD;
