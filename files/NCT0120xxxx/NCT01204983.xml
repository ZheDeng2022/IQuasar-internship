  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human milk is associated with substantial benefits to infants' health and development,&#xD;
      especially in premature infants. Some mothers are unable or unwilling to provide breast milk&#xD;
      to their infant. The use of donor human milk as an alternative to cow milk in these infants&#xD;
      has risen dramatically in the past year. However, there have been recent reports of&#xD;
      hyperphosphatemia and hyponatremia associated with the consumption of donor human milk&#xD;
      products. These electrolyte imbalances can lead to concerning symptoms, including headache,&#xD;
      nausea, vomiting, altered mental status, coma, seizures, or heart failure. It is important to&#xD;
      recognize and appropriately treat these electrolyte disturbances associated with donor human&#xD;
      milk to avoid potential nutritional problems.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a quality improvement project to evaluate the current standard of care of nutritional&#xD;
      management for very low birth weight infants receiving donor human milk products in the NICU&#xD;
      at Texas Children's Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no randomization, there are no control subjects, and therefore there is no&#xD;
      probability of group assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infants will be identified by the dietitian staff at TCH upon admission to the NICU (Levels 2&#xD;
      and 3) and communicated to the PI and PI's staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each subject, data collection will begin at the point that the infant first receives any&#xD;
      enteral feeding (including trophic feeds). All infants less than or equal to 1250 g birth&#xD;
      weight will be followed initially. If the parent declines to allow donor human milk products&#xD;
      for the infant, this will be noted in the data collection and no additional data will be&#xD;
      collected for this infant. If at a later time, the parent decides to allow donor human milk&#xD;
      products, we will begin data collection again. Our current experience is that &gt;95% of mothers&#xD;
      agree to donor human milk products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection will continue throughout the hospitalization until one week after all donor&#xD;
      human milk products have been discontinued or discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the medical chart, we will record the following data on a weekly basis: weight, length,&#xD;
      head circumference, labs (Chem 10 panel - BUN, creatinine, sodium, potassium, bicarbonate,&#xD;
      chloride, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, and glucose), medications, and the nutrition order&#xD;
      (parenteral and enteral nutrition feeding orders including volume, concentration, and&#xD;
      additives). If an abnormal nutrition-related lab is noted, changes in the nutrition order&#xD;
      will be recorded more frequently than on a weekly basis. A copy of the data collection&#xD;
      template is attached in Section S.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No labs will be requested for research purposes. No interventions are part of this protocol.&#xD;
      This protocol involves only minimal risk to individuals. A waiver of consent would not in any&#xD;
      way adversely affect the privacy rights and the welfare of the individuals.&#xD;
