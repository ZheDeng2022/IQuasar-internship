  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol provides expanded access to bone marrow transplants for children who lack a&#xD;
      histocompatible (tissue matched) stem cell or bone marrow donor when an alternative donor&#xD;
      (unrelated donor or half-matched related donor) is available to donate. In this procedure,&#xD;
      some of the blood forming cells (the stem cells) are collected from the blood of a partially&#xD;
      human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matched (haploidentical) donor and are transplanted into the&#xD;
      patient (the recipient) after administration of a &quot;conditioning regimen&quot;. A conditioning&#xD;
      regimen consists of chemotherapy and sometimes radiation to the entire body (total body&#xD;
      irradiation, or TBI), which is meant to destroy the cancer cells and suppress the recipient's&#xD;
      immune system to allow the transplanted cells to take (grow). A major problem after a&#xD;
      transplant from an alternative donor is increased risk of Graft-versus-Host Disease (GVHD),&#xD;
      which occurs when donor T cells (white blood cells that are involved with the body's immune&#xD;
      response) attack other tissues or organs like the skin, liver and intestines of the&#xD;
      transplant recipient. In this study, stem cells that are obtained from a partially-matched&#xD;
      donor will be highly purified using the investigational CliniMACS® stem cell selection device&#xD;
      in an effort to achieve specific T cell target values. The primary aim of the study is to&#xD;
      help improve overall survival with haploidentical stem cell transplant in a high risk patient&#xD;
      population by limiting the complication of GVHD.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be enrolled with alternative (mismatched/haplocompatible) related donors or&#xD;
      unrelated donors either for an initial transplant or as a rescue following rejection of a&#xD;
      previous graft or relapse following a previous transplant. For patients with mismatched&#xD;
      related donors, the majority of clinical experience has been with a T cell-depleted PBSC&#xD;
      product. Currently, no FDA-approved method for T cell depletion exists. Recent experience&#xD;
      with the CliniMACS® device has produced excellent results with a 70-75% survival in children,&#xD;
      many of whom were high risk patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients that receive transplants from unrelated donors usually receive stem cells that are&#xD;
      not T cell-depleted. However, this is associated with a high risk of GVHD. The excellent&#xD;
      results with mismatched related donor transplants justify expanding this approach to&#xD;
      unrelated donor transplant recipients if the HLA mismatch is sufficiently great. It is&#xD;
      anticipated that the use of the CliniMACS® device will result in a very low risk of GVHD&#xD;
      without the need for post-transplant immunosuppression. The outcomes in relatively small&#xD;
      studies for children receiving unrelated donor transplants using the CliniMACS® have been&#xD;
      comparable to or better than those receiving T replete transplants with post-transplant&#xD;
      immunosuppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol will allow the use of patient-specific conditioning regimens. Some patients&#xD;
      have contraindications to certain components of the conditioning regimen used for our ongoing&#xD;
      study under BB-IND 8817 (CC# 01151). An example is a patient with pre-existing organ&#xD;
      dysfunction that would be better served by the use of a reduced intensity conditioning&#xD;
      regimen. Another example is a patient for whom total body irradiation is contraindicated due&#xD;
      to very young age or prior radiation therapy. Finally, patients who would be otherwise&#xD;
      eligible for the predecessor study but who do not have an eligible related donor or a closely&#xD;
      matched unrelated donor would be eligible for this study. The target CD3+ T cell dose that&#xD;
      will be given will be 3 x 10^4/kg. The University of California, San Francisco Protocol&#xD;
      CC#01151 uses a dose of 3 x 10^4/kg. The T cell dose in the graft is usually &lt; 1 x 10^4/kg&#xD;
      after processing and T cells are added to the product.&#xD;

          -  For unrelated donors: Per New Algorithm, Jan. 14, 2016, effective immediately,&#xD;
             National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) &quot;Be The Match&quot; is adopting a revised algorithm&#xD;
             for determining if a donor is a research subject on their recipient's research&#xD;
             protocol: The NMDP will inform the donor of the activities and the use of donor's&#xD;
             apheresis product to be used in this study and obtain written consent from the donor.&#xD;
             Transplant centers are sent documentation of the donor consent to participate in the&#xD;
             research support activities. (The revised algorithm can be found on the &quot;Be the Match&#xD;
             Clinical Network&quot;)&#xD;
