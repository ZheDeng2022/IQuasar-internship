      In this comparative open-label cohort study, the investigators compared the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of tacrolimus (TAC)and cyclophosphamide (CYC) in the treatment of diffuse&#xD;
      proliferative and membranous lupus nephritis with severe renal disease. Treatment of lupus&#xD;
      nephritis (LN) with cyclophosphamide is effective, but retain a certain proportion of renal&#xD;
      function exacerbations. Tacrolimus may be a suitable substitute treatment for CYC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Forty patients with diffuse proliferative or membranous were recruited for this&#xD;
      trial, 45% of them had lower Ccr (&lt;60mL/min/1.73m2), 10% had increased serum creatinine&#xD;
      (&gt;180µmol/L) and 67.5% had nephritic proteinuria (&gt;3.5g/day). The investigators compared the&#xD;
      efficacy and adverse effects of TAC (0.04-0.08 mg/kg/d) and prednisone for 12 months (TAC&#xD;
      group) with pulse cyclophosphamide (750mg/m2 per month for six months) and prednisone&#xD;
      followed by azathioprine (50mg/day）for 6 months (CYC group).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multisystem autoimmune disease. About 60% of SLE&#xD;
      patients have renal disease, and patients with rapidly progressive destruction of renal&#xD;
      parenchyma have significantly poorer prognosis. Drug therapies that employ corticosteroids,&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide, and/or mycophenolate mofetil have improved patient outcomes, but a&#xD;
      significant number of patients have refractory disease or cannot tolerate these drugs.&#xD;
      Moreover, SLE patients who are partially responsive or resistant to treatment have&#xD;
      significant morbidity，mortality, and exacerbations of renal function. Thus, in patients with&#xD;
      lupus nephritis (LN), the two main causes of morbidity and mortality are treatment-related or&#xD;
      patient-related. It has been suggested that new therapies be developed for SLE that more&#xD;
      specifically target the relevant immunopathogenetic pathways, so as to achieve greater&#xD;
      efficacy and reduce therapy-related toxicities ，and to save or protect renal function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tacrolimus (TAC) is an immunosuppressive macrolide of the calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) group&#xD;
      that is widely administered following organ transplantation. In 1989, Takabayashi K. et al.&#xD;
      studied the effect of TAC on a murine model of SLE, and showed that it prolonged lifespan,&#xD;
      reduced proteinuria, and prevented the progression of nephropathy, although it had no&#xD;
      appreciable effect on the levels of anti-dsDNA antibodies. More recent small-scale studies&#xD;
      have shown that TAC may be an effective treatment for nephritic syndrome and LN8-11. However,&#xD;
      there is little clinical experience in the use of TAC for treatment of LN, especially for LN&#xD;
      with severe renal disease, and limited knowledge of the comparative efficacy of TAC and other&#xD;
      therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this comparative open-label cohort study, we compared the efficacy and safety of TAC and&#xD;
      CYC in the treatment of diffuse proliferative and membranous lupus nephritis with severe&#xD;
      renal disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LN is characterized by autoantibody-mediated vasculitis that may lead to rapid progression of&#xD;
      multi-system and organ damage. The kidneys are often involved due to excretion of excessive&#xD;
      urinary protein and/or rapidly progressive kidney injury, and end-stage renal disease may&#xD;
      result. Treatment-related differences in the rates of renal failure may not be discernible&#xD;
      early in the course of treatment, but there are definite advantages of rapid remission,&#xD;
      effective prophylaxis against relapse, and prevention of renal failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An intravenous pulse CYC regime has been the &quot;gold standard&quot; immunosuppressive regime for the&#xD;
      treatment of LN. The activation of lymphocytes, production of autoantibody, and high&#xD;
      expression of IFN-γ in the circulation and renal tissue are important indicators of renal&#xD;
      injury in SLE. Previous clinical and animal studies have shown that TAC therapy inhibits&#xD;
      T-lymphocyte activation, suppresses cytokine production in lymphocytes, suppresses&#xD;
      antigen-induced monokine (TNF-α) production in macrophages, reduces interleukin-2 mRNA&#xD;
      expression, decreases serum levels of IFN-γ and IFN-γ mRNA expression in the kidney and&#xD;
      spleen, and decreases serum levels of IgG-class anti-DNA antibodies. A recent study also&#xD;
      showed that TAC treatment affects B-cell antibody responses indirectly by interfering with&#xD;
      T-helper cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risk of end-stage renal failure is particularly high in patients with diffuse&#xD;
      proliferative glomerulonephritis. Despite the diverse and complex interplay of various&#xD;
      causative factors in individual patients, two previous studies suggested that SLE patients&#xD;
      who experience glomerulonephritis that does not diminish following treatment with&#xD;
      conventional immunosuppressive therapies have increased risk for subsequent deterioration of&#xD;
      renal function and poor long-term outcome. This suggests that there is an urgent need for&#xD;
      alternative immunosuppressive therapies for treatment of SLE, and motivated our investigation&#xD;
      of TAC. On the other hand, it is well know that calcineurin inhibitors (such as TAC) are&#xD;
      associated with chronic nephrotoxicity. For example, Tse et al. showed that one of six&#xD;
      patients developed chronic nephrotoxicity after 10 months of TAC therapy. As a calcineurin&#xD;
      inhibitor, TAC has a lower potential for nephrotoxicity than cyclosporine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Opportunistic infection is a severe complication that can result from treatment of LN with&#xD;
      immunosuppressive drugs.&#xD;
