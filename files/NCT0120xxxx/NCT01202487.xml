  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Minor lacerations are a commonly treated injury in the paediatric emergency department . Over&#xD;
      the past decade, standard closure of these lacerations has evolved from suture repair to&#xD;
      closure with tissue adhesive (also referred to as &quot;skin glue&quot;). Local anaesthetic is not&#xD;
      routinely used during application of skin glue as it was with sutures. There are, however,&#xD;
      several potential advantages to pre-treating wounds with topical LET&#xD;
      (Lidocaine-Epinephrine-Tetracaine), a liquid gel with anaesthetic and vasoconstrictive&#xD;
      properties. Some believe LET can improve patient comfort, increase the ease of glue&#xD;
      application, and lead to better healing when used on lacerations being repaired with tissue&#xD;
      adhesive. This study aims to address the question of whether or not pre-treatment with LET&#xD;
      improves outcomes in minor lacerations repaired with skin glue. The primary hypothesis is&#xD;
      that pre-treatment of minor lacerations with LET will decrease pain (as measured on a Visual&#xD;
      Analog Scale) during repair with tissue adhesive.&#xD;
