    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and the best dose of vorinostat when given&#xD;
      together with isotretinoin to see how well it works in treating patients with high-risk&#xD;
      refractory or recurrent neuroblastoma. Vorinostat may stop the growth of tumor cells by&#xD;
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Isotretinoin may help vorinostat work&#xD;
      better by making tumor cells more sensitive to the drug. Giving vorinostat together with&#xD;
      isotretinoin may be an effective treatment for neuroblastoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of vorinostat pediatric suspension&#xD;
      administered daily 4 times per week orally for two weeks, in combination with twice daily&#xD;
      13-cis-retinoic acid ([cisRA], isotretinoin) orally for 14 days to children with refractory&#xD;
      or recurrent neuroblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To define the toxicities of vorinostat administered in combination with cisRA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the pharmacokinetics of vorinostat given as a pediatric suspension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To describe the relationship of vorinostat pharmacokinetics to the occurrence of systemic&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the pharmacokinetics of cisRA given in combination with vorinostat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To describe histone acetylation levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells after&#xD;
      different doses of vorinostat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To describe, within the context of a Phase I study, the response rate of vorinostat&#xD;
      combined with cisRA in patients with recurrent/refractory neuroblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To describe the toxicity and response rate of vorinostat at the determined maximal&#xD;
      tolerated dose combined with cisRA in patients ages 22-30 years of age at study entry with&#xD;
      recurrent/refractory neuroblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of vorinostat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive isotretinoin orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-14, PO suspension* of&#xD;
      vorinostat once daily (QD) on days 1-4 of course 1, and capsules of vorinostat PO QD on days&#xD;
      1-4 and 8-11 of course 2 and subsequent courses. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 24&#xD;
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPANSION COHORT 1 (=&lt; 21 years of age): Once the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) has been&#xD;
      determined, patients are treated at that dose level as above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPANSION COHORT 2 (22-30 years of age): Patients receive isotretinoin as above and&#xD;
      vorinostat at the MTD on days 1-3 and 8-10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up periodically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE: *Patients less than 10 years of age are encouraged to continue to use oral suspension&#xD;
      beyond course 1.&#xD;

             after date of allogeneic stem cell transplant if without evidence of active graft&#xD;
             versus host disease; patients receiving an autologous stem cell infusion to support&#xD;
             non-myeloablative therapy are eligible at any time as long as they meet the&#xD;
             hematologic and other organ function criteria for eligibility&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A minimum of 6 weeks must have elapsed after 131I-MIBG therapy (timed from start of&#xD;

             another investigational new drug [IND]) within 30 days of study entry or while on&#xD;
             study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Since valproic acid has histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitory activity, patients must&#xD;
             not have received valproic acid within 30 days of study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prolongation of the corrected QT (QTc) interval has been rarely observed in adults&#xD;
             receiving vorinostat; patients must not be receiving azole anti-fungal therapy at the&#xD;
             time of study entry or while on protocol therapy; additional agents known to prolong&#xD;
             the QTc interval should be avoided unless therapeutic alternative medications are not&#xD;
             available&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not be receiving pentamidine therapy for Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP)&#xD;

             as they meet hematologic function criteria; patients with marrow disease are not&#xD;
             evaluable for hematologic toxicity; if dose limiting hematologic toxicity occurs in&#xD;
             two patients, then all subsequent patients enrolled must be evaluable for hematologic&#xD;
             toxicity, therefore patients with marrow metastases will be ineligible&#xD;
