      The specific aim of the proposed study is to conduct a pilot study involving 160&#xD;
      critically-ill lean and obese patients enrolled at 11 sites in Canada, the United States of&#xD;
      America, Belgium and France in order to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Confirm that we can achieve a clinically significant difference in calorie and protein&#xD;
           intake between the two intervention groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estimate recruitment rate i.e. number of eligible and enrolled patients per month per&#xD;
           site.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the safety, tolerance, and logistics around providing supplemental PN in the&#xD;
           study population in the context of a multicenter trial, e.g.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To ensure adequate glycemic control in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To ensure that the other metabolic consequences of the feeding strategies are&#xD;
                minimized.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To establish adequate compliance with study protocols and completion of case report&#xD;
                forms&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary aim of this pilot study will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To explore the effect of differential effects of calorie and protein delivery on muscle and&#xD;
      mass function.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Critically ill patients are often hypermetabolic and can rapidly become nutritionally&#xD;
      compromised. Malnutrition is prevalent in these patients and has been associated with&#xD;
      increased morbidity and mortality. Standard nutrition therapy, i.e. provision of calories,&#xD;
      protein and other nutrients consists primarily of enteral nutrition (via a feeding tube into&#xD;
      the gastrointestinal tract), parenteral nutrition (via an intravenous tube into the blood),&#xD;
      or occasionally a combination of both.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the provision of nutrition is sub-optimal and the majority of critically-ill&#xD;
      patients do not meet nutritional requirements. Recent studies report that average energy&#xD;
      intakes of critically ill patients are only 49% to 70% of calculated requirements. Despite&#xD;
      repeated, sustained efforts over the past few years, the investigators have not significantly&#xD;
      improved the amount of calories delivered via the enteral route. This leads us to conclude&#xD;
      that if the investigators are to be successful at increasing the provision of calories and&#xD;
      protein to patients at-risk, the investigators will have to supplement the calories via the&#xD;
      parenteral route.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Critically ill patients that are at extremes of weight are at a higher nutritional risk and&#xD;
      have higher mortality rates. A recent International multicenter observational study of 2772&#xD;
      ICU patients from 165 ICUs showed a significant inverse linear relationship between the odds&#xD;
      of mortality and total daily calories received. Increased amounts of calories was most&#xD;
      important for the BMI &lt; 20 group followed by the BMI 20 -&lt; 25 group and BMI &gt; 35 group with&#xD;
      no benefit of increased calorie intake for patients in the BMI 25 -&lt; 35 group. Feeding an&#xD;
      additional 1000 kcals almost halved the odds of 60-day mortality in patients with a BMI &lt; 25&#xD;
      or &gt; 35. Similar results were observed for feeding an additional 30 grams of protein per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, a prospective randomized trial is warranted to confirm our hypothesis that in patients&#xD;
      with a BMI of &lt; 25 and those with a BMI &gt; 35 increasing the provision of more energy and&#xD;
      protein can impact clinical outcomes. The results of this study will serve to answer some&#xD;
      fundamental questions with regards to impact of amount of energy and protein delivered to&#xD;
      nutritional at-risk ICU patients and will inform current practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized to one of 2 interventions: enteral nutrition alone or enteral&#xD;
      nutrition plus parenteral nutrition (supplemental PN group).&#xD;
