      This study described in the present protocol consists of two parts. Part A is a multiple&#xD;
      ascending dose study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of ascending&#xD;
      doses of GSK1144814. Part B is an open label design in healthy male subjects to assess the&#xD;
      GSK1144814 Neurokinin1 receptor occupancy.&#xD;

      This study described in the present protocol consists of two parts. Part A is a multiple&#xD;
      ascending dose study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of ascending&#xD;
      doses of GSK1144814. The study is a single blind, randomised, placebo controlled design in&#xD;
      healthy male and female (of non childbearing potential) subjects. Part B is an open label&#xD;
      design in healthy male subjects to assess the GSK1144814 Neurokinin 1 receptor occupancy&#xD;
      after repeat oral dosing by positron emission tomography scanning with [11C] GR205171.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy as determined by a responsible physician, based on a medical evaluation&#xD;
             including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and cardiac&#xD;
             monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters outside the&#xD;
             reference range for the population being studied may be included only if, in the&#xD;
             opinion of the Investigator, the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk&#xD;
             factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female aged between 18 and 65 years (inclusive) for Part A, or male aged&#xD;
             between 25 and 55 years (inclusive) for Part B.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A female subject is eligible to participate in Part A if she is of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Non childbearing potential defined as pre menopausal females with a documented tubal&#xD;
        ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea&#xD;
        (in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone [FSH]&#xD;
        higher than 40 mIU/mL and oestradiol lower than 40 pg/mL [lower than 140 pmol/L] is&#xD;
        confirmatory).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt&#xD;
             will be required to discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post menopausal status&#xD;
             prior to study enrolment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2 to 4 weeks will elapse&#xD;
             between the cessation of therapy and the blood sampling; this interval depends on the&#xD;
             type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their post menopausal status, they&#xD;
             can resume the use of HRT during the study without the use of a contraceptive method.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A male subject must agree to use one of the contraception methods listed in Section&#xD;
             8.1.2. This criterion must be followed from the first investigational product dosing&#xD;
             day until at least 3 months after receiving the last dose of the investigational&#xD;
             product.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body weight higher than or equal to 50 kg and body mass index (BMI) within the range&#xD;
             18 to 29.9 kg/m2 (inclusive).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the&#xD;
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  QTcB or QTcF lower than 450 msec.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Demonstrates no evidence of mental impairment or co morbid psychiatric disorders or&#xD;
             suicidal risk (as determined with the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale [C&#xD;
             SSRS]).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has a positive pre study drug/alcohol screen. A minimum list of drugs that&#xD;
             will be screened for include amphetamines, barbiturates, cocaine, opiates,&#xD;
             cannabinoids and benzodiazepines.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A positive pre study hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or positive hepatitis C virus&#xD;
             (HCV) antibody test result within 3 months of Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A positive test result for antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 1/2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant renal abnormality (from medical history or as indicated by laboratory&#xD;
             investigations. In addition, subjects with idiopathic haematuria or proteinuria or&#xD;
             conditions such as benign orthostatic proteinuria and benign familial haematuria&#xD;
             should be excluded from the study).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of the study start defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        An average weekly intake of greater than 21 units or an average daily intake of greater&#xD;
        than 3 units (males), or defined as an average weekly intake of greater than 14 units or an&#xD;
        average daily intake of greater than 2 units (females). One unit is equivalent to a half&#xD;
        pint (220 mL) of beer or 1 measure (25 mL) of spirits or 1 glass (125 mL) of wine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational&#xD;
             product within 3 month prior to the first investigational product dosing day in the&#xD;
             current study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first&#xD;
             investigational product dosing day.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of prescription or non prescription drugs, including vitamins, herbal and dietary&#xD;
             supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days (or 14 days if the drug is a&#xD;
             potential enzyme inducer) or 5 half lives (whichever is longer) prior to receiving the&#xD;
             first dose of the investigational product, unless in the opinion of the Investigator&#xD;
             and GSK Medical Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or&#xD;
             compromise subject safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of sensitivity to any of the investigational products, or components thereof&#xD;
             or a history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the Investigator or GSK&#xD;
             Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products&#xD;
             in excess of 600 mL within a 56 day period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unwillingness or inability to follow the procedures outlined in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History or presence of clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias, or other clinically&#xD;
             significant cardiac disease.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Previous inclusion in a research and/or medical protocol involving nuclear medicine,&#xD;
             PET or radiological investigations with significant radiation burden (a significant&#xD;
             radiation burden being defined as International Commission on Radiological Protection&#xD;
             (ICRP) Category IIb or above: No more than 10 mSv in addition to natural background&#xD;
             radiation, in the previous 3 years including the dose from this study).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Family history of cancer (one or more first degree relative diagnosed before the age&#xD;

             injury, epilepsy, space occupying lesions, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease,&#xD;
             vascular dementia, transient ischaemic attack, schizophrenia, major depression, etc)&#xD;
             that may influence the outcome or analysis of the scan results.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of a cardiac pacemaker or other electronic device or ferromagnetic metal&#xD;
