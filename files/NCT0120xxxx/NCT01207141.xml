    <textblock>
      This open-label clinical trial will evaluate the pharmacodynamics, pharmacogenomics and early&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of steroid-free Tacrolimus (TAC) monotherapy and its minimization after&#xD;
      induction with rabbit, anti-human thymocyte globulin (rATG, Genzyme, Cambridge, MA) in&#xD;
      children and adults with pediatric liver transplantation. Eighty subjects (0-21 years)&#xD;
      receiving liver transplantation will be enrolled. Incidence and severity of biopsy-proven&#xD;
      acute cellular rejection (ACR) is a primary endpoint as well as time to Tacrolimus whole&#xD;
      blood concentrations &lt;8 ng/ml The expected incidence of ACR is 50% and is derived from a&#xD;
      non-consecutive subject population (n=40) who received an identical regimen in IND 64555.&#xD;
      This incidence is acceptable because the long term sequel of rejection reported with other&#xD;
      allografts have not been observed in liver grafts during IND 64555. These risks are further&#xD;
      negated by the unique regenerative capacity of the liver allograft. An OBSERVATIONAL arm is&#xD;
      being included in this trial. Because the numbers of pediatric liver transplants (LTx) are&#xD;
      small in any single center setting, no information is known about relative outcomes on a&#xD;
      conventional protocol, in children receiving conventional protocol of steroids+Tacrolimus.&#xD;
      The PURPOSE of this additional recruitment is OBSERVATIONAL, only. Therefore, these subjects&#xD;
      will NOT be randomized. Rather, by studying all types of patients, the investigators hope to&#xD;
      utilize maximally, all available subjects, to understand the relative place of&#xD;
      monotherapeutic induction. In turn, this will be the basis for a follow-up comparative,&#xD;
      randomized trial.&#xD;

      This open-label clinical trial will evaluate the pharmacodynamics, pharmacogenomics and early&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of steroid-free Tacrolimus (TAC) monotherapy and its minimization after&#xD;
      induction with rabbit, anti-human thymocyte globulin (rATG, Genzyme, Cambridge, MA) in&#xD;

      receiving liver transplantation will be enrolled. Incidence and severity of biopsy-proven&#xD;
      acute cellular rejection (ACR) is a primary endpoint as well as time to Tacrolimus whole&#xD;
      blood concentrations &lt;8 ng/ml The expected incidence of ACR is 50% and is derived from a&#xD;
      non-consecutive subject population (n=40) who received an identical regimen in&#xD;
      Investigational New Drug (IND) 64555. This incidence is acceptable because the long term&#xD;
      sequel of rejection reported with other allografts have not been observed in liver grafts&#xD;
      during IND 64555. These risks are further negated by the unique regenerative capacity of the&#xD;
      liver allograft. An OBSERVATIONAL arm is being included in this trial. Because the numbers of&#xD;
      pediatric liver transplants (LTx) are small in any single center setting, no information is&#xD;
      known about relative outcomes on a conventional protocol, in children receiving conventional&#xD;
      protocol of steroids+Tacrolimus. The PURPOSE of this additional recruitment is OBSERVATIONAL,&#xD;
      only. Therefore, these subjects will NOT be randomized. Rather, by studying all types of&#xD;
      patients, we hope to utilize maximally, all available subjects, to understand the relative&#xD;
      place of monotherapeutic induction. In turn, this will be the basis for a follow-up&#xD;
      comparative, randomized trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol also incorporates a clearly defined schedule to minimize Tacrolimus (TAC)&#xD;
      maintenance therapy in each subject, based on presence or absence of early biopsy-proven&#xD;
      rejection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary clinical endpoints are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Time to steroid elimination. 4. Duration of steroid treatment. 5. Steroid-resistant&#xD;
      rejection. 6. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) antigenemia (pp5) and CMV disease 7. Epstein-barr virus&#xD;
      (EBV) viremia 8. Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) 9. Frequency of use of&#xD;
      Non-immunosuppressive co-medications - antihypertensives, magnesium and bicarbonate&#xD;
      supplements, hypokalemic agents (safety endpoint).&#xD;
&#xD;
      10. Time to first rejection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary pharmacodynamic and pharmacogenomic endpoints are 1. Longitudinal evaluation of&#xD;
      peripheral lymphocyte subsets prior to and at 1, 4, and 12 months after liver&#xD;
      transplantation. This will establish the pattern of lymphocyte reconstitution after depletion&#xD;
      with rATG. 2. Inheritance disequilibrium of 100,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms in the&#xD;
      major histocompatibility region. This will entail pre-transplant characterization of these&#xD;
      single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in all children and their biological parents.&#xD;
      Preliminary studies lead us to expect identification of outcome-specific patterns of&#xD;
      inheritance of SNPs. Such patterns could be used in future studies to allocate appropriate&#xD;
      treatment to children based on predicted risk of rejection. For example, the predicted&#xD;
      rejector could receive steroids with rATG+Tacrolimus, while the non-rejector could avoid&#xD;
      steroids completely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study type: This is a prospective, open-label, evaluation of steroid-free, induction&#xD;
      immunosuppression in children receiving liver transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Children 0- 21 years receiving liver transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent: This will be obtained by the PI or his physician co-investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: Not applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group: Not applicable&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test group: rATG pretreatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Premedication with acetaminophen 10 mg/kg orally + diphenhydramine 1 mg/kg intravenously&#xD;
           + methylprednisolone 2 mg/kg, intravenously.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. rATG 5 mg/kg will be initiated prior to liver transplantation, with half the dose&#xD;
           infused over at least 4 hours, prior to reperfusion of the liver graft. Total dose to be&#xD;
           infused over 24 hours, but no less than 8 hours. If the requisite amount cannot be&#xD;
           infused before LTx, it can be continued through the LTx procedure and afterward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Tacrolimus will be initiated at 0.01 mg per kg body weight orally. If biopsy-proven&#xD;
           rejection does not occur, Tacrolimus will be titrated to whole blood concentrations:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Month 1 12-15 ng/ml Months 2-3 8-12 ng/ml Month 4-6 5-8 ng/ml Months 6-12 &lt;5 ng/ml&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. This minimization protocol will be delayed by 3 months if biopsy proven acute cellular&#xD;
           rejection occurs. For example, if rejection occurs, Tacrolimus is increased to month 1&#xD;
           levels of 12-15 ng/ml, and steroids added to the regimen. Steroids will be eliminated&#xD;
           within 3 months of rejection, and Tacrolimus minimization resumed as described above.&#xD;
           These protocols are our standards of care in the event of rejection, whether we use the&#xD;
           rATG induction approach with steroid-free Tacrolimus, or Tacrolimus with steroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Laboratory tests per clinical protocol. The clinical standard of care will be followed&#xD;
           in performing post-LTx monitoring labs consisting of complete blood count with&#xD;
           differential count, serum sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, BUN, creatinine and&#xD;
           glucose, and liver function tests consisting of Total bilirubin, aspartate alanine&#xD;
           transaminase (ALT), aspartate glutamine transaminase (AST), and glutamyl galactosyl&#xD;
           transaminase (GGT), and TAC whole blood concentrations. These laboratory tests are&#xD;
           performed at least weekly in the first and second months, twice monthly in month 3, and&#xD;
           monthly thereafter to the sixth month. The extra 5 ml needed for pharmacodynamic and&#xD;
           pharmacogenomic studies is discussed further in items 5 and 6, and in Table 7.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Pharmacogenomic studies will consist of characterizing 100,000 SNPs using a SNP array&#xD;
           and DNA extracted from 3 ml of whole blood obtained pre-LTx, from each of 80 children.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Table 7 (located in . Blood sampling strategy for: pharmacodynamic studies which will&#xD;
           measure the lymphocyte subsetsas well as dendritic cells types 1 and 2 are shown in the&#xD;
           following table (table 8). Concentration of rATG will also be measured in 0.1 ml human&#xD;
           plasma obtained from the same blood sample. Concentration associated with half-maximal&#xD;
           depletion of each subset will be determined by pharmacodynamic models based on Hill&#xD;
           equations.&#xD;
&#xD;
           This assay will be carried out in the laboratories of Dr. Rakesh Sindhi at the Rangos&#xD;
           Research Center at 530 45th St, Pittsburgh, Pa 15201. Specimens will be stored in the&#xD;
           transplant laboratory indefinitely, and will be under the control of the principal&#xD;
           investigator, Dr. Rakesh Sindhi. The specimens will be stored to include assigned code&#xD;
           numbers and the information linking these code numbers to the corresponding subjects'&#xD;
           identities will be kept in a separate, secure location. The specimens will be shared&#xD;
           with secondary investigators without identifiers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Liver biopsy will be performed per clinical standard of care, to rule out acute cellular&#xD;
           rejection. No protocol biopsies will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. The treatment of rejection consists of steroids taper per standard of care. This&#xD;
           standard includes methylprednisolone, total dose up to 30 mg/kg, or its equivalent. If&#xD;
           this occurs, TAC whole blood concentrations will be titrated starting with 12-15 ng/ml&#xD;
           during month 1 following the rejection event. Thereafter, the timing of downward&#xD;
           titration of TAC concentrations will follow the schema outlined in item 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Steroid-resistant rejection is defined as biopsy-proven acute cellular rejection not&#xD;
           responsive to methylprednisolone or its equivalent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Follow-up for each patient is 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. All children will receive standard of care for antiviral and antipneumocystic&#xD;
           prophylaxis&#xD;
