  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an investigator-blinded, bilateral comparison study in 30 subjects with atopic&#xD;
      dermatitis. It is designed to assess and compare the efficacy of Elidel® (pimecrolimus) cream&#xD;
      1% and Hylatopic™ Plus Emollient Foam™ in subjects with atopic dermatitis. Subjects will&#xD;
      apply Elidel® (pimecrolimus) cream 1% twice daily for four weeks on a chosen target&#xD;
      eczematous area located on one side of the body and then apply Hylatopic™ Plus Emollient&#xD;
      Foam™ three times daily on a symmetrical target eczematous area on the opposite side of the&#xD;
      body. A randomized list will be created to determine which side the subject applies each&#xD;
      medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be consented prior to any study evaluations or procedures. After signing the&#xD;
      consent and meeting all inclusion/exclusion criteria, qualified and enrolled subjects will&#xD;
      apply study medication (Elidel® and Hylatopic™ Plus Emollient Foam™) to chosen affected areas&#xD;
      for four weeks. Photography will be used to record the location of target lesions at the&#xD;
      baseline, week two and week four/final visits. Subject's disease status will be assessed by&#xD;
      two methods: 1) Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) and 2) Target Lesion Symptom Score (TLSS)&#xD;
      (see sections V.B.2 and V.B.3). PGA as well as TLSS will be made at baseline (Day 0), week&#xD;
      two (Day 14 +/- 2 days) and week 4/final visit (Day 28 +/- 2days) visits for each of the&#xD;
      target lesions. Half scales (i.e. 0.5, 1.5) will not be used. The presence or absence of skin&#xD;
      atrophy and telangiectasias will be noted at each study visit as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, subjects' self-assessments of their perception of degree of disease and itching&#xD;
      severity control will be collected at each visit for each target lesion. This assessment will&#xD;
      be made using a four point scale and Itch Severity Scale (visual analogue score) respectively&#xD;
      (see section V.B.4). Lastly, subjects will take a Product Preference Survey at week 4/final&#xD;
      visit (Day 28 +/- 2days). Parents (or guardians) will moderate Product Preference Surveys for&#xD;
      subjects that are younger than 12 years of age.&#xD;
