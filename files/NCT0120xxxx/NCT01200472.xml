      STUDY DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group,&#xD;
      efficacy and safety study in 30 patients with erosive osteoarthritis of interphalangeal&#xD;
      joints. The study is composed of 4 phases: a pre-randomization phase for up to 35 days&#xD;
      followed by a 91-day randomized, double-blind two arm treatment phase, followed by a 77-day&#xD;
      open label treatment phase for all study participants and a 28-day observational follow-up&#xD;
      phase. Efficacy of the double blind and open label phase will be assessed at study day 84 and&#xD;
      168 after treatment start respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DURATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study length will be approximately 231 days for individual patients. With approximately a&#xD;
      12 month recruitment period the study is planned to last from January 2010 until July 2011&#xD;
      (19 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to evaluate the 84-day efficacy of apremilast 20 mg twice per day&#xD;
      [BID], subsequent to a 7-day dose titration, compared with placebo, for the treatment of the&#xD;
      symptoms of erosive hand osteoarthritis. Further objectives are to evaluate the effects on&#xD;
      pain, disease activity, structural damage, quality of life, safety and tolerability.&#xD;
