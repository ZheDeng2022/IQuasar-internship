      Renal atherosclerotic stenosis (RAS) is a prevalent cause of secondary hypertension (HT).&#xD;
      Since there are still uncertainties as to whether and in what patients revascularization by&#xD;
      means of percutaneous renal angioplasty (PTRAS) should be pursued, we designed a study&#xD;
      exploiting an optimized patient selection strategy and using hard experimental endpoints to&#xD;
      unravel these uncertainties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: to determine if revascularization by means of PTRAS is superior or&#xD;
      equivalent to optimal medical treatment for preserving glomerular filtration rate in the&#xD;
      ischemic kidney as assessed by 99mTcDTPA sequential renal scintiscan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives: to determine if the two treatments are equivalent in lowering blood&#xD;
      pressure (BP), preserving overall renal function and regressing damage in the target organs&#xD;
      of hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: prospective multicenter randomized, unblinded two-arm study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will have clinical and/or radiological evidence of unilateral or bilateral&#xD;
      RAS, defined by stenosis of the proximal portion of the renal artery and its main&#xD;
      bifurcations at angioCT. Duplex scan will exclude nephroangiosclerosis as the latter could&#xD;
      bias the assessment of the outcome of revascularization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria. RAS affecting the main renal artery or its major branches at angio-CT&#xD;
      either &gt; 70% or, if &lt; 70 with post-stenotic dilatation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Renal function will be assessed with 99mTc-DTPA renal scintigraphy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size (30 patients per arm) was calculated to have a 90% power to detect a difference&#xD;
      in means of GFR in the vascularized (or control untreated kidney) of 7.5 ml/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arms&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Revascularization: digital scan angiography and PTA with stenting of the renal artery at&#xD;
           the ostium or at truncular level, plus optimal medical therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Medical therapy: the drug regimen that had been optimized during the run-in period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The absolute value of GFR assessed by 99TcDTPA in the ischemic kidney will be used as&#xD;
      quantitative variable and compared between groups at each time point. A categorical&#xD;
      definition of kidney loss, defined as a GFR in the ischemic kidney of &lt; 5 ml/min, will be&#xD;
      also used and the rate of achievement of such endpoint will be compared.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background Renal atherosclerotic stenosis (RAS) is an increasingly prevalent causes of&#xD;
      secondary hypertension (HT), and is becoming one of the first causes of end-stage renal&#xD;
      failure requiring renal replacement therapy in an aging population. Atherosclerotic RAS is&#xD;
      associated with a high cardiovascular risk profile leading to a considerable excess rate of&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality from stroke, coronary heart and peripheral vascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent advances in antihypertensive drug therapy and in intensive risk factor management&#xD;
      prompted the undertaking of prospective randomized trials that compared percutaneous renal&#xD;
      angioplasty (PTRAS) with medical therapy. Unexpectedly, these trials failed to show&#xD;
      compelling benefits of revascularization when added to effective medical therapy. However,&#xD;
      they had serious limitations, which raised a number of criticisms, and limited to weight of&#xD;
      their conclusions. Hence, clinicians are still left with uncertainties as to whether and in&#xD;
      what patients revascularization should be pursued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is conceivable that only a study design exploiting an optimized patient selection strategy&#xD;
      and a use of hard experimental endpoints could resolve these uncertainties and thus lead to a&#xD;
      better clinical management of the increasing population with atherosclerotic RAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives. The primary objective of the METRAS study is to determine if revascularization by&#xD;
      means of PTRAS is superior or equivalent to optimal medical treatment for preserving&#xD;
      glomerular filtration rate in the ischemic kidney as assessed by 99TcDTPA sequential renal&#xD;
      scintiscan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives (see appropriate section) will be to determine if the two treatments are&#xD;
      equivalent in lowering blood pressure (BP), preserving overall renal function and regressing&#xD;
      damage in the target organs of hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: prospective multicenter randomized, unblinded two-arm study. Enrolment. Eligible&#xD;
      patients entail adult hypertensive of both genders with clinical and/or radiological evidence&#xD;
      of unilateral or bilateral RAS. Clinical evidence of RAS will be unexplained renal&#xD;
      dysfunction (GFR &lt; 60 ml/min), uncontrolled or refractory hypertension (defined as resistant&#xD;
      to lifestyle measures and to at least 3 drugs including a diuretic in adequate doses with&#xD;
      failure in lowering systolic and diastolic BP to goal) and/or significant worsening of renal&#xD;
      function (20% increase of serum creatinine) after administration of ACE inhibitors and/or an&#xD;
      abdominal bruit and/or evidence of atherosclerotic involvement of other sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiological evidence of atherosclerotic RAS will be defined by stenosis of the proximal&#xD;
      portion of the renal artery and its main bifurcations at angioCT. Besides Angio-CT, patients&#xD;
      will undergo Duplex scan to exclude nephroangiosclerosis as the latter could bias the&#xD;
      assessment of the outcome of revascularization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will be offered participation to the METRAS study and have to sign an&#xD;
      informed written consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: angio-CT evidence of RAS affecting the main renal artery or its major&#xD;
      branches &gt; 70% or, if &lt; 70 with post-stenotic dilatation Exclusion criteria: see dedicated&#xD;
      section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Run-in. Eligible patients will undergo a 4-week run-in period during which BP treatment,&#xD;
      LDL-cholesterol, homocysteine and glycemic control will be optimized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive antiplatelet treatment with aspirin or ticlopidine if intolerant&#xD;
      ASA, or clopidogrel, if intolerant to ASA and ticlopidine, throughout the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AngioCT will be performed to assess the abdominal aorta and renal artery anatomy and&#xD;
      pathology. RAS localization will be assessed blindly by 2 experienced radiologists.&#xD;
      Precautions will be adopted to minimize the chances of worsening renal function with angioCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      99mTc-DTPA renal scintigraphy will be performed on 2 consecutive days, before and after&#xD;
      captopril administration, according to available guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment with ACEI/ARB will be stopped for 3-7 days (depending on drug half-life) before the&#xD;
      scintigraphy. If ACEI withdrawal will be held to be unsafe, the captopril scintigraphy will&#xD;
      be omitted and only baseline 99mTc-DTPA scintigraphy will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All on-site measurements from imaging will be validated by a core laboratory at the&#xD;
      University of Padova.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Renal function will be assessed with MDRD formula and the reciprocal of creatinine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target organ damage (TOD). Transthoracic echocardiogram with Doppler with assessment of LV&#xD;
      mass index, relative thickness, the E/A wave peak flow velocity rate and tissue Doppler will&#xD;
      be used to detect changes in LV remodeling and diastolic filling. Measurement of pulse wave&#xD;
      velocity, and augmentation index will be used to follow the changes in aortic stiffness and&#xD;
      vascular damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BP. Clinic and ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) will be performed to evaluate the BP changes&#xD;
      in each treatment arm. ABPM will be used to determine the BP variability (smoothness index)&#xD;
      during day and night.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization. A matching algorithm considering both the RI and the presence of&#xD;
      unilateral/bilateral stenosis will be used to randomly assign patients to the 2 treatment&#xD;
      arms. This randomization strategy will allow us to obtain patients with similar distribution&#xD;
      of RI and an equal number of the patients with unilateral and bilateral stenosis in each&#xD;
      treatment arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size. Power calculation (nQuery Vers, 6.0, Statistical Solutions) showed that assuming&#xD;
      a 16% drop-out rate, a common standard deviation of 8.0 ml/min, an equal sample size in each&#xD;
      treatment arm, using a two group t-test with a 0.05 2-sided significance level, with 30&#xD;
      patients per arm our study will have a 90% power to detect a difference in means of GFR in&#xD;
      the vascularized (or control untreated kidney) of 7.5 ml/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment arms&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Revascularization. The patients randomized to this treatment will undergo digital scan&#xD;
           angiography (DSA) and PTA with stenting of the renal artery. PTA will be performed at&#xD;
           the ostium or at truncular level. Stenoses involving more distal arterial vessels will&#xD;
           be recorded and considered for data analysis but will not be treated. The patients&#xD;
           randomized to revascularization will continue on their antihypertensive drug regimen.&#xD;
           The dose and number of drugs will be down-titrated with the aim of pursuing the target&#xD;
           BP values.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Medical therapy The patients randomized to medical treatment will continue only on the&#xD;
           antihypertensive drug regimen that had been optimized to reach the BP goal during the&#xD;
           run-in period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental endpoints. The absolute value of GFR assessed by 99TcDTPA in the ischemic kidney&#xD;
      will be used as quantitative variable and compared between groups at each time point.&#xD;
      Moreover, for the purpose of the Cox regression analysis a categorical definition of kidney&#xD;
      loss, defined as a GFR in the ischemic kidney of &lt; 5 ml/min, will be used and the rate of&#xD;
      achievement of such endpoint will be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential confounders. To minimize the untoward effect of differences in CV risk&#xD;
      anti-platelet, lipid-lowering, and antidiabetic agents, when needed, will be given to all&#xD;
      patients, and maintained at the same dosage achieved at the end of the run-in period&#xD;
      throughout the study. The possible unbalanced distribution of confounders between treatment&#xD;
      arms will be handled by calculating the propensity score (8, 9) and entering it in the Cox&#xD;
      regression analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up. Visits will be scheduled at 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after revascularization or&#xD;
      beginning of the medical therapy. The study will then continue in an observational setting&#xD;
      with outpatient visits scheduled at 6-month intervals for 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection. Data will be collected using specifically designed database and forms&#xD;
      (created in Open Clinica; http://www.openclinica.org); they will be monitored in real time&#xD;
      and then analyzed at the core laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis. Comparison of GFR in the ischemic kidney between groups&#xD;
      (revascularization vs. medical therapy) at each time point will be performed using t-test,&#xD;
      repeated measure ANOVA with adjustment of potential confounders, Cox regression model for&#xD;
      loss of kidney function as defined above. Sub-group analysis (comparison unilateral vs&#xD;
      bilateral stenosis) will be similarly undertaken. ROC curves will be used to determine if the&#xD;
      baseline 99mTc DTPA scintiscan-derived indexes can predict the outcome of treatment using the&#xD;
      changes in GFR over time as reference. Bland-Altman plot and analysis will be used to compare&#xD;
      the estimate of GFR obtained using cystatin using the overall (right and left kidneys) GFR as&#xD;
      reference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multivariate techniques and on the propensity score, which considers all relevant covariables&#xD;
      that will differ between the revascularization and the medical treatment rate group, will be&#xD;
      used to avoid the untoward effect of a possible unbalanced distribution of confounders&#xD;
      between treatment arms (D'Agostino RB, Jr. Circulation 2007; Maiolino G. JCEM 2008).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results. The Metras study will clarify whether renal revascularization by means of&#xD;
      PTRAS associated with optimal medical therapy is superior or equivalent to optimal medical&#xD;
      treatment alone in preventing deterioration of renal function, as assessed as GFR in the&#xD;
      ischemic kidney.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A previous study by Radermacher et al suggested that the presence of irreversible renal&#xD;
      microvascular changes, e.g. nephroangiosclerosis, could prevent the patients from having&#xD;
      benefit with revascularization. In fact an intrarenal resistance index (RI) &gt; 0.80 at the&#xD;
      Doppler analysis was claimed to predict no improvement of BP or renal function, as assessed&#xD;
      by measuring the creatinine clearance. However, the latter is an index of global function,&#xD;
      and therefore provides no information on the GFR of the ischemic kidney.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study, by randomizing patients for matching RI values, is expected to clarify whether&#xD;
      endovascular treatment can slower GFR loss even in the patients with nephroangiosclerosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, by meeting its secondary endpoints it will help clarifying some clinically relevant&#xD;
      issues as the BP lowering, the rate of renal and major cardiovascular events, and the change&#xD;
      in quality of life with/without endovascular treatment in patients with atherosclerotic RAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of the study. The METRAS Study will last for 5 years. This time interval is expected&#xD;
      to be sufficient to register renal and major cardiovascular events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Centers. This study will be performed within the Italian Society of Arterial Hypertension&#xD;
      (SIIA) to achieve randomization of the number of patients needed to provide significant power&#xD;
      to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A core laboratory in Padova will adjudicate the eligible patients and will randomize&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusions and Perspectives. The METRAS Study has been designed to provide a conclusive&#xD;
      answer to a very debated question: is angioplasty combined with stenting and associated with&#xD;
      optimal medical therapy equivalent to the optimal medical treatment alone in preventing&#xD;
      deterioration of renal function, assessed as GFR in the ischemic kidney? A novel approach,&#xD;
      consisting in evaluating deterioration of renal function, as assessed as GFR in the ischemic&#xD;
      kidney, rather than the overall GFR, will clarify if PTRAS can protect a kidney with stenotic&#xD;
      artery from functional declining.&#xD;
