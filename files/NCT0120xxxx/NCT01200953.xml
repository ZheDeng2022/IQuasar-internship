  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Increased clinical attention has been paid to the evaluation and management of&#xD;
      bioterrorism-related illness (such as anthrax infection) and emerging infectious diseases&#xD;
      (such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome [SARS] and new strains of influenza). However,&#xD;
      evaluation and treatment data for these illnesses are often limited because human infections&#xD;
      to date have been relatively limited. Further knowledge about diseases of bioterrorism&#xD;
      concern and emerging infectious diseases may lead to more effective forms of therapy to&#xD;
      prevent disease-related illnesses and deaths.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To apply standardized, documented, and carefully monitored evaluation and treatment methods&#xD;
      for bioterrorism- and biodefense-related illnesses and emerging infectious diseases at the&#xD;
      National Institutes of Health Clinical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals at least 2 years of age who have confirmed or suspected infection by a&#xD;
           biodefense or bioterrorism agent, or an emerging infectious disease agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals at least 2 years of age who have confirmed or suspected exposure to a&#xD;
           biodefense or bioterrorism agent, an emerging infectious disease agent, or who have&#xD;
           close exposure to an individual who is suspected of being infected with one of these&#xD;
           agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Health care workers who are involved in medical treatment of the abovementioned infected&#xD;
           or exposed individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All eligible persons will have an initial screening evaluation to determine the&#xD;
           circumstances of possible infectious exposure (e.g., where, when, and how exposed),&#xD;
           current medical condition and medical care given, and any aspects of medical history&#xD;
           that might be relevant to the exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may be seen in an outpatient clinic or in the Special Clinical Studies Unit&#xD;
           (SCSU) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The NIH SCSU is a hospital ward&#xD;
           specially designed to minimize the risk of spreading infection to others.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Upon admission, participants will provide blood and urine samples, have an&#xD;
           electrocardiogram to measure heart activity, and have specific tests or procedures&#xD;
           associated with the particular infectious agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants who develop illnesses will be treated with the standard of care for known&#xD;
           diseases or with experimental measures, depending on the nature of the illness. Separate&#xD;
           consent may be required for these treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will remain on this study for at least 1 year following the period of&#xD;
           active evaluation and treatment. Participants may be asked to come to the NIH outpatient&#xD;
           clinic on a periodic basis for medical evaluations and blood tests, and may be asked to&#xD;
           keep a diary card to record any unusual signs or symptoms of possible infection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since the fall 2001 distribution of letters containing Bacillus anthracis spores via the US&#xD;
      postal system, increased attention has been paid to the evaluation and management of&#xD;
      bioterrorism-related illness. Similarly, the emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome&#xD;
      (SARS) in 2003, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2012, Ebola virus disease in&#xD;
      both 2013-16 and 2018-20, and, most recently, the global advent of SARS-CoV-2 infections in&#xD;
      2019, coupled with the ongoing threat of global influenza pandemics, have fostered intensive&#xD;
      interest in the evaluation and management of emerging infections both in the US and&#xD;
      internationally. Data to this end are often limited, however, in that while many such&#xD;
      diseases exist in nature, human illness may only occur rarely or sporadically. The primary&#xD;
      purpose of this protocol is to characterize the clinical course and determine the underlying&#xD;
      pathophysiology of infection with the causative agent of any disease of bioterrorism concern&#xD;
      (whether of natural or deliberate origin), agents under study in biodefense-related research&#xD;
      laboratories, or emerging infectious disease pathogens of public health concern via the&#xD;
      evaluation of infected or exposed persons, close contacts of potentially infected or exposed&#xD;
      persons, as well as those who have recovered from illness. Other goals include the&#xD;
      characterization of immune responses to such diseases; the evaluation of diagnostic tests for&#xD;
      the rapid identification of the causative agents of such diseases in clinical specimens; and&#xD;
      the&#xD;
&#xD;
      observation, follow-up, and simulation training of medical staff involved in the care of the&#xD;
      above categories of patients. The ultimate goal is that further knowledge about diseases of&#xD;
      bioterrorism concern and emerging infectious diseases may lead to more effective forms of&#xD;
      therapy and improve disease-related morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
