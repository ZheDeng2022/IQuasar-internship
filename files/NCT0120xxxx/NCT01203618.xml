  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether therapy with farletuzumab is effective and&#xD;
      safe in the treatment of resectable, non-functioning pituitary adenomas.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-functioning pituitary adenomas are the most frequent type of pituitary tumors, defined by&#xD;
      the lack of hormonal overproduction from the tumor. Non-functioning macroadenomas are &gt; 1 cm&#xD;
      in size that can cause progressive visual loss, headaches, and symptoms of pituitary&#xD;
      dysfunction (hypopituitarism and/or hyperprolactinemia). Initial treatment for these type of&#xD;
      tumors is trans sphenoidal surgical resection. In cases where the outcome is incomplete&#xD;
      surgical resection of the tumor, repeat surgery and external beam radiation therapy may be&#xD;
      performed. Previous clinical work suggests there may be a role for a folate receptor in the&#xD;
      treatment of non-secretory, pituitary adenomas. MORAb-003 is a monoclonal antibody that has&#xD;
      the potential to be an effective agent against resectable, non-functioning pituitary&#xD;
      adenomas. MORAb-003 has been shown to be well tolerated. This study allows the opportunity to&#xD;
      determine if therapy with farletuzumab is effective and safe.&#xD;
