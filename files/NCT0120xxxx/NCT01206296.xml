    <textblock>
      This is a phase II study evaluating the use of intraperitoneal gemcitabine given&#xD;
      intraoperatively and as adjuvant therapy for patients with resectable pancreas cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the overall safety of intraperitoneal&#xD;
      gemcitabine given intraoperatively and postoperatively for adjuvant treatment of resectable&#xD;
      pancreatic adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to evaluate the efficacy of this treatment regimen as reflected&#xD;
      in overall survival at 2-years, to study the patterns of disease recurrence following this&#xD;
      treatment, to study the pharmacology of intraperitoneal gemcitabine and to study changes in&#xD;
      peritoneal cytology with pancreatic cancer resection.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the&#xD;
             pancreas or periampullary cancer (duodenum, ampulla of Vater or distal common bile&#xD;
             duct).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients without a histologically confirmed diagnosis prior to surgical exploration,&#xD;
             will have intraoperative frozen section to confirm the diagnosis prior to the&#xD;
             administration of intraoperative intraperitoneal gemcitabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must undergo adequate preoperative imaging evaluation to determine&#xD;
             resectability including contrast enhanced CT scan or MRI with or without endoscopic&#xD;
             ultrasound&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a complete surgical resection to grossly negative margins. The&#xD;
             margins will be assessed in a routine fashion: the surgeon will decide on the level of&#xD;
             transection based on visual inspection making sure that the visible/palpable tumor is&#xD;
             removed with a negative margin. The specimen will be assessed for pancreatic duct and&#xD;
             bile duct margin by intraoperative frozen section and an attempt will be made to have&#xD;
             microscopically negative margins in all cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have not received chemotherapy for the treatment of their pancreatic&#xD;
             cancer prior to surgery scheduled at the Washington Hospital Center may be included in&#xD;
             the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt;18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the&#xD;
             use of gemcitabine in patients &lt;18 years of age, children are excluded from this study&#xD;
             but will be eligible for future pediatric phase 2 combination trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of greater than 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) performance status &lt;2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  leukocytes &gt;3,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  absolute neutrophil count &gt;1,500/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  platelets &gt;100,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  total bilirubin within normal institutional limits or compatible with preoperative&#xD;
             biliary obstruction caused by the tumor&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) &lt;2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal or compatible with&#xD;
             preoperative biliary obstruction caused by the tumor&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  creatinine within normal institutional limits OR&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  creatinine clearance &gt;45 mL/min&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of gemcitabine on the developing human fetus at the recommended&#xD;
             therapeutic dose are unknown. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential and&#xD;
             men must agree to avoid pregnancy prior to study entry and for the duration of study&#xD;
             participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while&#xD;
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had radiotherapy or chemotherapy for their pancreatic cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with metastatic disease in the liver or other distant sites, intraabdominal&#xD;
             lymph nodes beyond regional draining lymph nodes or with malignant ascites&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to gemcitabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because gemcitabine is an antimetabolite&#xD;
             (pyrimidine analog) with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects.&#xD;
             Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants&#xD;
             secondary to treatment of the mother with gemcitabine, breastfeeding should be&#xD;
             discontinued if the mother is treated with gemcitabine. These potential risks may also&#xD;
             apply to other agents used in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of&#xD;
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with gemcitabine. In addition, these&#xD;
             patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with&#xD;
             marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients&#xD;
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.&#xD;
