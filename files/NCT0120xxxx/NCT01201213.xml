      A need exists to define the best local anesthetic and technique for pain relief in early&#xD;
      labour. We suggest that calculating the molar Median Effective Dose for bupivacaine,&#xD;
      levobupivacaine and ropivacaine given both by the intrathecal (as a combined spinal epidural&#xD;
      and epidural routes) would provide a valid comparison between the pain relieving properties&#xD;
      of all three drugs, from which a reasoned assessment of side effects can be made.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite 40 years of epidural analgesia, a consensus still does not exist regarding the best&#xD;
      local anesthetic or the best technique for the provision of pain relief in early labour. Two&#xD;
      new local anesthetics, levobupivacaine and ropivacaine, have recently been introduced into&#xD;
      clinical practice because they have shown reductions in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular&#xD;
      toxicity in several small animal, large animal and human volunteer studies. Evidence of&#xD;
      improved safety from these studies suggest that the new local anesthetics should be used for&#xD;
      surgical anesthesia, such as cesarean section, and limb block, where large volume, high&#xD;
      concentrations of local anesthetics are required, and the risk of toxicity is high.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In contrast, the use of levobupivacaine and ropivacaine in small doses for analgesia in&#xD;
      labour remains controversial, and bupivacaine remains the intrathecal and extradural local&#xD;
      anesthetic of choice in many obstetric units. A change from bupivacaine to one of the newer&#xD;
      drugs for analgesia in labour would require evidence documenting a distinct advantage of one&#xD;
      the new local anesthetics in providing equivalent pain relief, but with less side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Until now, intrathecal and epidural studies investigating the efficacy of bupivacaine,&#xD;
      levobupivacaine and ropivacaine in obstetric anesthesia have focused on a comparison of %&#xD;
      weight/volume solutions. However, close scrutiny of the chemical composition of local&#xD;
      anaesthetics with the same % weight/volume shows marked differences in molar concentration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reason for differences in molar concentration are two-fold. Levobupivacaine is presented&#xD;
      commercially as a base and not as a hydrochloride and therefore has 12.7% more molecules than&#xD;
      the equivalent concentration of bupivacaine. In addition, ropivacaine has a smaller molecular&#xD;
      weight than either drug and thus has 4.5% more molecules than bupivacaine and 8.4% less&#xD;
      molecules than levobupivacaine. Although molar differences between drugs are relatively&#xD;
      slight, a small reduction in molar concentration may provide similar pain relief, but result&#xD;
      in a large reduction in side effects due to the shape and position of the efficacy and side&#xD;
      effect dose response curves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparative studies of all three drugs have been inconclusive. Intrathecal studies have shown&#xD;
      a potency hierarchy of bupivacaine &gt; levobupivacaine &gt; ropivacaine, but equivalent potency&#xD;
      between levobupivacaine and ropivacaine when injected with the opioid, sufentanil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epidural studies have also shown the potency of levobupivacaine to be equivalent or greater&#xD;
      than ropivacaine, but, when combined with sufentanil at &quot;equipotent doses&quot;, both have shown a&#xD;
      longer duration of analgesia than bupivacaine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use of %w/v solutions, addition of opioids, pre-study assumptions of &quot;equipotency&quot; and&#xD;
      variable definitions of pain relief have all served to confuse the issue of local anaesthetic&#xD;
      potency and no definite conclusion exists as to whether any drug displays an advantage when&#xD;
      given by either the intrathecal or epidural route.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second controversy concerns the mode of drug administration. Although epidural analgesia is&#xD;
      popular in Scotland for initiating pain relief in labour, major centres in the South of&#xD;
      England, Europe and North America use a combined technique of spinal followed by epidural&#xD;
      analgesia. The principal advantage is quicker pain relief, but the rapid onset of action may&#xD;
      be associated with hypotension, motor block and technical failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A need exists to define the best local anesthetic and technique for pain relief in early&#xD;
      labour. We suggest that calculating the molar Effective Dose for bupivacaine, levobupivacaine&#xD;
      and ropivacaine given both by the intrathecal and epidural routes would provide a valid&#xD;
      comparison between the pain relieving properties of all three drugs, from which a reasoned&#xD;
      assessment of side effects could be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, our aim is to compare molar concentrations of bupivacaine, levobupivacaine and&#xD;
      ropivacaine when injected into the intrathecal and epidural spaces for pain relief in the&#xD;
      first stage of labour, allowing a rational, molar comparison of the intrathecal and epidural&#xD;
      efficacy of all three drugs, and thus providing a meaningful side effect profile. Only then&#xD;
      can an informed decision be made regarding best practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design Phase IV, single centre, randomised, single-blind study in pain relief during&#xD;
      early labor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective To determine the median effective concentration of bupivacaine,&#xD;
      levobupivacaine and ropivacaine after intrathecal and extradural injection for pain relief in&#xD;
      the first stage of labor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives To chart a derived dose response curve for bupivacaine, levobupivacaine&#xD;
      and ropivacaine after intrathecal and extradural injection Determine the intrathecal /&#xD;
      epidural potency ratio of each drug To measure the degree of motor block using Bromage and&#xD;
      Straight Leg Raising scales To measure side effects such as hypotension, nausea and vomiting&#xD;
      To measure mode of delivery and fetal outcome&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  The patient is in early labour ≤ 5cm cervical dilation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient is American Association of Anaesthesiologists Grade I - II&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient provides written informed consent to participate in the trial prior to&#xD;

           required&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient has received any investigational drug within the 90 days prior to the study&#xD;
           or is scheduled to receive one during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  The patient has received opioids in the last 4 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient has evidence of alcohol or drug abuse&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  The fetus has shown signs of intrauterine growth retardation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient has findings on pre-study evaluations (e.g. laboratory results, medical&#xD;
           history, physical examination, ECG) that are clinically significant in the&#xD;
           investigator's opinion such to exclude entry into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following informed and written consent, patients will be randomised into six groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients, ward staff and primary investigator will be blinded to the study drug. Study drugs&#xD;
      will be prepared according to Hospital Department of Pharmacy guidelines on the preparation&#xD;
      of drugs for clinical studies. All study preparations will be coded with an equal chance of&#xD;
      receiving one of six infusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Size 16g intravenous cannula&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hartmann's solution 500ml infused at 100ml h-1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Epidural analgesia or intrathecal analgesia in order to standardise the intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
           3ml intrathecal starting at a mass of 10 µmol bupivacaine, levobupivacaine or&#xD;
           ropivacaine by a combined spinal-epidural analgesia technique (groups A, B, C).&#xD;
&#xD;
           o 20 ml epidural starting at a mass of 50 µmol bupivacaine, levobupivacaine or&#xD;
           ropivacaine (groups D, E, F),&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intrathecal saline placebo will not be used because intrathecal injection influences&#xD;
      subsequent epidural spread and increases the risk of hypotension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments The primary pain assessment will be the 100mm Visual Analog Scale. The visual&#xD;
      analog will be performed pre-epidural, and at 5 minute intervals after epidural insertion for&#xD;
      30 minutes, and every 5 minutes for a further 15 minutes in &quot;unsuccessful&quot; patients as&#xD;
      highlighted below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three responses to epidural analgesia will be charted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Successful &quot;Excellent&quot;pain relief ≤ 10 mm at any time within 30 min of epidural&#xD;
           insertion&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Unsuccessful &quot;Good or reasonable&quot; pain relief &gt; 10mm at all times within 30 min of&#xD;
           epidural insertion, but ≤ 10 mm within 45min after rescue injection of 10ml 0.25%&#xD;
           bupivacaine&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Technical failure &gt; 10mm at all times within 30 min of epidural insertion, and still &gt;&#xD;
           10 mm within 45min despite rescue injection of 10ml 0.25% bupivacaine&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three decisions will be made based on each response:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Response&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. &quot;Excellent&quot;pain relief. Next patient receives: 1 mmol less intrathecal or 5 mmol less&#xD;
           epidural local anaesthetic&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. &quot;Good or reasonable&quot; pain relief. Next patient receives: 1 mmol more intrathecal or 5&#xD;
           mmol more epidural local anaesthetic&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Technical failure Next patient receives same mass of drug&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concomitant Medication Additional analgesia will be allowed only in accordance with this&#xD;
      protocol. The patient will be allowed to take her present analgesic medication up to 12 hours&#xD;
      preoperatively. Opiate-containing medication (including codeine containing combinations) will&#xD;
      not be allowed less than 4 hours pre-study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Data analysis will proceed according to guidelines for randomised&#xD;
      controlled trials. The first stage of analysis will be to use descriptive statistics to&#xD;
      describe recruited individuals in relation to those eligible, and to investigate&#xD;
      comparability of the trial arms at baseline. The primary analysis will be an&#xD;
      intention-to-treat comparison between the two groups for both primary and secondary outcomes.&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be presented as Effective Dose with confidence intervals.&#xD;
      Categorical data will be presented as number and % of events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification of sample size Two-way analysis with 6 groups. However the maximum number of&#xD;
      logical comparisons within an effect can be reduced to 6 such that the threshold P value for&#xD;
      significance at the P&lt;0.05 level will be P=0.0085&#xD;
&#xD;
      The coefficient of variation from the isobole study is approximately 20%. The coefficient of&#xD;
      variation from the an intrathecal study ranged from about 15% to 18%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So to detect a nominal 30% difference in potency, we will need N=27 per group for an up-down&#xD;
      design with 90% power.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the&#xD;
      Guidelines on Good Clinical Practice. The study will be submitted to a Multi-Centre Research&#xD;
      Ethics Committee followed by Local Research Ethics Committees for approval prior to&#xD;
      commencing the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Side effects or adverse events. Assessments of blood pressure, respiratory rate, nausea,&#xD;
      retching/vomiting and sedation at will occur at 5 minute intervals for the first 30 minutes&#xD;
      after insertion of the epidural catheter, then at 45 minutes if necessary. The incidence and&#xD;
      severity of nausea /vomiting/sedation will be assessed using a verbal rating score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serious Adverse Events will be defined as foetal or maternal haemodynamic or cerebral side&#xD;
      effects occurring within 15 minutes of epidural or spinal injection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Foetal heart rate &lt; 100 bpm&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maternal hypotension &lt; 30% pre-epidural level&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bradycardia &lt;50bpm&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any cardiac arrythmia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Convulsions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Residual neurological damage&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dizziness or headache&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fever &gt; 38 centigrade&#xD;
&#xD;
      All serious adverse events will be immediately reported to the Ethics committee and Medicine&#xD;
      and Health Regulatory Authority&#xD;
