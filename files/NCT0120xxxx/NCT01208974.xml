  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to see if a participant's nipple and areola can be&#xD;
      safely preserved by adding radiation to these areas after a nipple-sparing mastectomy and&#xD;
      immediate breast reconstruction.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Prophylactic NAC Irradiation.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 13 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The recommended Phase II dose will be reported as the MTD, among the doses tested, at which only 0 or 1 out of 6 participants experiences DLT. DLT will be reported as any of the following: Grade 4 skin rash or pain, NAC necrosis, any toxicity requiring interruption of NAC irradiation greater than 2 weeks or any grade 4 or 5 treatment related toxicity. Toxicity will be evaluated by treating physician using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) version 3.0.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cosmetic Outcome</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Cosmetic Outcome will be reported as the number of participants in each of the 4 cosmetic outcome category ordinal scale. The 4 cosmetic outcome category scales are excellent, good, fair and poor. Both physician and patient's evaluation will be reported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disease-Free Survival Rate in Study Participants</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Disease-free survival rate in study participants will be assessed. Disease-free survival is defined from the date of surgery until the date of documented recurrence (local or distant) or breast cancer-related death, whichever occurs first. Patients who die without documentation of recurrence will be considered to have had disease recurrence at the time of death, unless there is documented evidence that no recurrence occurred before death.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival Rate in Study Participants</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Overall Survival rate in study participants will be assessed. Overall survival is the defined from the date of surgery until the date of death due to any cause. In the absence of death, follow-up time will be censored by the date of last contact..</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Recurrence Rate in Study Participants</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Rate of disease recurrence in study participants. The definition of local recurrence is histologic evidence of recurrent carcinoma, either invasive or non-invasive in the nipple-areola complex in the ipsilateral breast. Clinical evidence of carcinoma by physical exam and/or mammograms/MRI will not be evidence of local recurrence until biopsy proof.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants will undergo a Nipple-Areolar Complex (NAC)-sparing mastectomy with immediate reconstruction and axillary surgery, if indicated, on Week 1. Anytime between Weeks 5-8, participants will undergo a dose-escalation/de-escalation of prophylactic NAC radiation treatment (RT) twice daily (minimum of 4 hours apart) for 5 days. Dose escalation/de-escalation design are as follows:&#xD;
Dose Level I - 10 fractions of 2.0 Gy for a total of 20 Gy&#xD;
Dose Level II - 10 fractions of 2.5 Gy for a total of 25 Gy&#xD;
Dose Level III - 10 fractions of 3.0 Gy for a total of 30 Gy&#xD;
Dose Level IV - 10 fractions of 3.5 Gy for a total of 35 Gy&#xD;
Participants will be treated between cohorts of 2-6 patients per dose level starting at dose level II. Dose escalation stops when 2 out of 2-6 participants encounter Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT).&#xD;
Standard of care chemotherapy, at treating physician's discretion, can be initiated 2 weeks after RT.</description>
