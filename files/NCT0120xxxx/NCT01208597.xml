      Owing to its image resolutions and its convenience in diagnosis, both better than abdominal&#xD;
      ultrasound, transvaginal ultrasound is nowadays widely applied in diagnosing practice in&#xD;
      obstetrics and gynecology. As a result, female examinees who undergo these check-up&#xD;
      procedures have to expose their private parts, instead of their abdomens like the old days.&#xD;
      According to the literature, women who receive transvaginal ultrasound check-ups normally&#xD;
      have anxiety reactions, and worry about pain and discomfort. In clinical practice, when&#xD;
      giving advice to the examinees to go through this check-up, more than often the diagnosis&#xD;
      itself is its sole purpose, and little psychological assistance is offered. Traditional&#xD;
      clinical space and disposal process tend to be designed to serve the purposes of conforming&#xD;
      to the customs of medical staff and to the integrity of human resources and facilities in the&#xD;
      hospital managers' minds, and less frequently tend to take the needs of patients into&#xD;
      consideration. Consequently these patients are forced to enter strange medical environments&#xD;
      and accommodate to the existent medical systems, with physical and psychological discomforts,&#xD;
      to suffer from even more uncomfortable and anxiety-causing check-ups. Current medical service&#xD;
      is required to not only provide a clean environment, but also give attention to creating an&#xD;
      artistic space to increase healthy factors to the environment. The literature points out that&#xD;
      a comfortable and artistic space can eliminate environmental strangeness, and help patients&#xD;
      to soothe their pressures caused by their own and by the environment.&#xD;

      This women-centered study designs a &quot;humanized service program&quot;, to give women care and&#xD;
      respect, and protect women's privacy and their rights to know; the space design is&#xD;
      women-concerned, warm and homelike-layout; its furnishings are well-designed in order to&#xD;
      facilitate access for women to use, and give every effort to maintain women's safety, comfort&#xD;
      and self-esteem. The main purpose of this space is to provide the women who receive&#xD;
      transvaginal ultrasound &quot;the human-based check-up service program&quot;, in order to see how it&#xD;
      affects the physical and psychological experiences of these women, its service quality and&#xD;
      service satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study adopts a quasi-experimental research method and takes the ultrasound examination&#xD;
      rooms of the obstetrics and gynecology department of a medical center in northern Taiwan as&#xD;
      the sites of collecting case data. The studied targets are the women who came to the&#xD;
      obstetrics and gynecology clinic as outpatients and were required to undergo transvaginal&#xD;
      ultrasound. The women in the control-group were offered with &quot;the routine service&quot;, and the&#xD;
      experimental group, the &quot;humanized service program&quot;. The study results compare differences&#xD;
      between the control group and the experimental group with regard to their respective basic&#xD;
      information concerning their physical and psychological experiences, their opinions on its&#xD;
      service quality and service satisfaction, discuss about the effectiveness of this program,&#xD;
      and explore the inter-relationships among the physical and psychological experiences, service&#xD;
      quality and service satisfaction. The research tools include the humanized service programs&#xD;
      and the research questionnaires. The research questionnaires include a basic information&#xD;
      scale, a physical and psychological experiences scale, a service quality scale and a service&#xD;
      satisfaction scale. Scales of humanized service programs and basic information adopt expert&#xD;
      validity for validity evaluation; the physical and psychological experiences scale, the&#xD;
      service quality scale and the service satisfaction scale adopt expert validity and internal&#xD;
      consistency reliability and construct validity for reliability and validity evaluation. The&#xD;
      results show that its reliability and validity both fall within acceptable ranges.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chi-square test analysis reveals that the cases in the two groups have homogeneity. From the&#xD;
      descriptive statistics, it can be learned that the 9 most common existing feelings the women&#xD;
      had who received transvaginal ultrasound are the following: sense of tension over the whole&#xD;
      body, feeling nervous, feeling awkward , feeling shy, feeling embarrassed, worrying about&#xD;
      discomfort, worrying about pain, fear of infection and lower abdominal fullness feeling. The&#xD;
      outpatients in the two groups perceived the service quality dimensions as such: the highest&#xD;
      dimension is the Empathy, and the lowest is the Tangibles. The highest dimension of the two&#xD;
      groups concerning the check-up service satisfaction is the Staff's Attitude, and the lowest&#xD;
      is the environment and the Waiting Time for Check-Up. Independent-samples T test analysis&#xD;
      shows that the points of the cases in the experimental group are significantly higher than&#xD;
      the ones of the control group in these three aspects: physical and psychological experience,&#xD;
      service quality and service satisfaction. This study results demonstrates that the&#xD;
      human-based check-up service program is effective for physical and psychological experiences,&#xD;
      service qualities and satisfaction. It lessens the physical and psychological negative&#xD;
      feelings of the women when they underwent transvaginal ultrasound, and at the same time&#xD;
      improves the transvaginal ultrasound service quality and satisfaction. Structural Equation&#xD;
      Modeling (SEM) analysis of the relationships among the three, physical and psychological&#xD;
      experience, service quality and service satisfaction, shows that there is a significant&#xD;
      positive correlation between service quality and physical and psychological experiences, also&#xD;
      between service quality and service satisfaction. Moreover, the service quality produces an&#xD;
      indirect effect on service satisfaction through the physical and psychological experience.&#xD;
      There is also a significant positive correlation between physical and mental feelings and&#xD;
      service satisfaction; this indicates that increase in service quality may affect the physical&#xD;
      and psychological experience of women to tend to be positive, and enlarge service&#xD;
      satisfaction; when women have more positive physical and mental feelings, it will also&#xD;
      increase their satisfaction with the services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The physical and psychological experience scale designed in this study can be applied to&#xD;
      other assessments of women's physical and psychological feelings under the situations of&#xD;
      necessary perineal area exposures, such as Pap smear, colposcopy and so on. &quot;The humanized&#xD;
      service program&quot; can offer the transvaginal ultrasound examinees better service; besides, it&#xD;
      can be used in various female-based obstetrics and gynecology-related check-ups. Within other&#xD;
      medical divisions, this concept can also be applied in order to provide more superior medical&#xD;
      service and care.&#xD;
