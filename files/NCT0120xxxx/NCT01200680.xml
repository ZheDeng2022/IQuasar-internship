      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chordoma is a rare, slow growing, often fatal bone cancer derived from remnants of the&#xD;
      embryonic notochord. It occurs mostly in the axial skeleton (skull base, vertebrae, sacrum&#xD;
      and coccyx), is more frequent in males than females, and has a median age at diagnosis of&#xD;
      58.5 years, with a wide age range. This typically sporadic tumor is often advanced at&#xD;
      presentation, and mortality is high due to local recurrence or distant metastases. The usual&#xD;
      treatment is surgery, followed by adjuvant radiation therapy. Chemotherapy has not had a&#xD;
      significant treatment role. Reports of a small number of families worldwide with two or more&#xD;
      relatives with chordoma support a role for susceptibility genes in chordoma etiology.&#xD;
      Recently we determined that duplications of the T gene co-segregated with disease in four&#xD;
      multiplex chordoma families. The T gene encodes brachyury, a tissue-specific transcription&#xD;
      factor that is expressed in notochord cells and is essential for formation and maintenance of&#xD;
      the notochord. Some of the other chordoma families that we studied did not have T-gene&#xD;
      duplications; the aggregation of chordomas in these families may result from changes in other&#xD;
      susceptibility genes or other types of mutations targeting the T gene. We are continuing gene&#xD;
      identification studies of multiplex chordoma families at the NIH Clinical Center under&#xD;
      protocol 78-C-0039. We also want to determine whether alterations in any identified chordoma&#xD;
      susceptibility genes are associated with sporadic chordoma in the general population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The major goal of this protocol is to identify sporadic chordoma patients willing to provide&#xD;
      germline and tumor DNA for studies to determine the frequency of alterations in chordoma&#xD;
      susceptibility genes. Our previous protocols with SEER and Massachusetts General Hospital to&#xD;
      identify chordoma patients were limited to residents of specific geographic regions in the&#xD;
      U.S. (2 states and 2 metropolitan areas) or to patients with pediatric skull base tumors.&#xD;
      This protocol will enroll patients who more broadly represent the age, site and gender&#xD;
      distributions of sporadic chordoma in the general U.S. population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients are males and females in the U.S. with chordoma diagnosed at any age and at&#xD;
      any primary site. Because we want to obtain saliva from all participants, eligibility is&#xD;
      limited to patients who will be greater than or equal to age 6 years at the time of&#xD;
      enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study description and contacting information including an e-mail link to the study&#xD;
      contact person will be posted on web sites of two chordoma support groups. We will mail study&#xD;
      information to be given to patients to colleagues at major medical centers that treat&#xD;
      chordoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The components of the study will be carried out in subjects' homes using materials mailed to&#xD;
      them. Up to 100 participants will: 1) complete a self-administered Personal and Family&#xD;
      Medical History Questionnaire, 2) collect saliva using a saliva collection kit, and 3)&#xD;
      provide permission to obtain medical/pathology records, and paraffin blocks or slides on each&#xD;
      primary chordoma. Parents will serve as proxies for minor children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will recontact patients who report chordoma in at least one blood relative. If we confirm&#xD;
      the relative's chordoma diagnosis, we will invite the study subject and selected family&#xD;
      members to participate in clinical and gene mapping studies under protocol 78-C-0039. We may&#xD;
      also recontact study participants to tell them about any new studies on chordoma etiology.&#xD;
      They can decide at that time whether they want to participate in them.&#xD;

      Synopsis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Chordoma is a rare, slow growing, often fatal bone cancer derived from remnants&#xD;
      of the embryonic notochord. It occurs mostly in the axial skeleton (skull base, vertebrae,&#xD;
      sacrum and coccyx), is more frequent in males than females, and has a median age at diagnosis&#xD;
      of 58.5 years, with a wide age range. This typically sporadic tumor is often advanced at&#xD;
      presentation, and mortality is high due to local recurrence or distant metastases. The usual&#xD;
      treatment is surgery, followed by adjuvant radiation therapy. Chemotherapy has not had a&#xD;
      significant treatment role.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although most chordomas are sporadic, we previously identified germline duplication of the T&#xD;
      gene (T-dup+), now designated TBXT, which encodes brachyury, a transcription factor that&#xD;
      plays an important role in embryonic development, as a major susceptibility mechanism in&#xD;
      familial chordoma. A common polymorphism in TBXT is also associated with an increased risk&#xD;
      for both familial and sporadic chordoma. Although chordomas are slow-growing, local&#xD;
      recurrences are common and treatment options are limited particularly for those with advanced&#xD;
      disease. Thus, a better understanding of predisposing factors and molecular processes in&#xD;
      chordoma is critically needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify loci that cause susceptibility to chordoma and related tumors&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the functional significance of mutations or other genetic changes at these&#xD;
           loci&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the frequency of alterations in chordoma susceptibility genes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify genetic determinants conferring chordoma and related tumors risk in&#xD;
           individuals&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the natural history of disease in chordoma and related tumors, including&#xD;
           evaluation of survival&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint: All cancers that occur in individuals and families at high risk of chordoma&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints: Markers of pre-malignant conditions such as benign notochordal cell&#xD;
      tumors (BCNT), notochordal remnants&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: Eligible patients are males and females in the U.S. or Canada with chordoma&#xD;
      or related tumors diagnosed at any age and at any primary site. Because we want to obtain&#xD;
      saliva from all participants, eligibility is limited to patients who will be &gt; age 6 years at&#xD;
      the time of enrolment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design of Sites/Facilities Enrolling Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The components of the study will be carried out in subjects homes using materials mailed to&#xD;
      them. The components include: 1) a self-administered Personal and Family Medical History&#xD;
      Questionnaire, 2) saliva collected as a source of germline DNA using a saliva collection kit;&#xD;
      3) providing permission to obtain medical/pathology records, and paraffin blocks or slides on&#xD;
      each primary ch ordoma and related tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Start Date: 01/22/2011 End Date: 12/31/2051&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to be an open-ended natural history study with anticipated enrollment&#xD;
      of 10-40 patients per year, with an accrual ceiling of 400.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants may be reevaluated every few years to document changes in their history of&#xD;
      chordoma over time and to collect information on treatment and survival. This is essential&#xD;
      for establishing the natural history of chordoma and related tumors and to investigate the&#xD;
      clinical significance of molecular subtypes.&#xD;
