      INTRODUCTION: There is an important need for inexpensive drugs that treat neuropathic pain.&#xD;
      Early research suggests that methadone may be a good, inexpensive drug to treat neuropathic&#xD;
      pain. Methadone is available in a low cost powder that is easily prepared for different&#xD;
      routes of administration. This study will look at the effect and safety of methadone compared&#xD;
      to the regular treatment of morphine for the treatment of chronic neuropathic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES: First the investigators want to determine if methadone is effective and safe for&#xD;
      the treatment of neuropathic pain. Since a placebo control group would be unethical, the&#xD;
      proposed comparator will consist of the &quot;gold standard&quot; conventional treatment, controlled&#xD;
      release morphine. The investigators will compare methadone to controlled-release morphine&#xD;
      with regard to how it affects the level of pain and extent of side effects. Next the&#xD;
      investigators want to examine safety as well as to determine whether methadone leads to&#xD;
      improvements in physical and emotional functioning, and participants' satisfaction with the&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS: A double blind, randomized trial comparing methadone and controlled release morphine&#xD;
      is proposed. After 1-week, participants will be randomly assigned to either methadone or&#xD;
      controlled release morphine and will gradually build to a dose at which they receive adequate&#xD;
      pain relief without unacceptable levels of side effects. This 5-week phase will be followed&#xD;
      by a 6-week dose phase and then a 4-week tapering off phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study drug: The study drug is methadone supplied in 2.5 mg tablets. The comparator will&#xD;
      consist of controlled release morphine in 10 mg tablets. The dose of each will range from&#xD;
      1-12 tablets taken every 12 hours (dose ranges methadone 5-60 mg/day, controlled release&#xD;
      morphine 20-240 mg/day).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting: This is a 3-site study involving pain clinics in Halifax, Nova Scotia; London,&#xD;
      Ontario; and Calgary, Alberta.&#xD;
