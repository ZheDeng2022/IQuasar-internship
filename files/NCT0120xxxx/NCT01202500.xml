  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Toxoplasmosis is a benign disease in healthy adults, but can be serious in the case of&#xD;
      contamination during pregnancy: the parasite can pass through the placental barrier and&#xD;
      infect the foetus. The severity of congenital infection varies, but in France, where maternal&#xD;
      seroconversions during pregnancy are treated, the manifestations of the disease are often&#xD;
      infraclinical at birth and only appear during the first years of life in the form of&#xD;
      retinochoroiditis. In order to prevent long-term sequellae, children with confirmed&#xD;
      congenital toxoplasmosis (TC) are treated with pyrimethamine combined with either&#xD;
      sulfadiazine or sulfadoxine (Fansidar®). The relative efficacy of these two combinations has&#xD;
      not yet been evaluated. Moreover, there is no consensus about the duration of the treatment,&#xD;
      which varies, in France, from 12 to 24 months depending on the centre. Compared with the&#xD;
      duration of parasitaemia in non-treated children, which can persist for up to 4 weeks, these&#xD;
      treatments are very long. They are also far longer than the 3 months of treatment, which is&#xD;
      in accordance with the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations, given in Denmark to&#xD;
      infants identified as being infected with the parasite during neonatal screening. A one-year&#xD;
      treatment was developed in the United States, but it mainly concerns only symptomatic&#xD;
      children, given the absence of generalised screening in the United States of America (USA).&#xD;
      We have no arguments to justify the use of treatments lasting one year or more in children&#xD;
      with asymptomatic or mildly-symptomatic TC. As these treatments carry certain risks, which&#xD;
      may be severe, notably with regard to haematological or skin conditions, they have to be&#xD;
      supervised closely with biological tests, which adds further constraints for both the&#xD;
      children and their parents and increases the cost to health care systems.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Children meeting the following criteria can be included:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-severe congenital toxoplasmosis diagnosed in utero or in the first 3 months of&#xD;
             life, whether or not in utero treatment was given&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treated for 3 months with pyrimethamine combined with sulfamides.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  age from 3 to 6 months (&gt; 2 months and &lt; 7 months)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Diagnostic criteria for congenital toxoplasmosis:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  antenatal period: positive Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) on the amniotic fluid or&#xD;
             positive mouse inoculation for the amniotic fluid&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  postnatal period: presence of specific Immunoglobuline M (IgM) and/or Immunoglobuline&#xD;
             A (IgA), positive Western Blot Chemistry (WBC), increase in Immunoglobuline G (IgG).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Severe congenital toxoplasmosis is defined by the presence at birth of at least one of the&#xD;
        following signs: &gt; or egal 3 cerebral calcifications, hydrocephaly, microcephaly,&#xD;
        convulsions, microphtalmy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Informed consent must be provided by both parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Children with the following cannot be included:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  a severe form of congenital toxoplasmosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  inflammatory retinal disease at inclusion or in whom the treatment is contra-indicated&#xD;
             (history of hypersensitivity to one of the components, severe renal or hepatic&#xD;
             insufficiency, a history of hepatitis linked to treatment with Fansidar®).&#xD;
