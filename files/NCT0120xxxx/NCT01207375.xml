      The current study is a double-blind, placebo-control randomized clinical trial examining the&#xD;
      efficacy of memory retraining in Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). Impairment in higher level&#xD;
      cognitive processing, such as new learning and memory, is one of the most common deficits in&#xD;
      individuals with TBI and such deficits have been shown to exert significant negative impact&#xD;
      on multiple aspects of everyday life, including occupational and social functioning. Despite&#xD;
      these findings, few studies have attempted to treat these cognitive deficits in order to&#xD;
      improve the everyday functioning of individuals with TBI. The current proposal will evaluate&#xD;
      (a)the efficacy of this treatment protocol within a TBI population,(b) the impact of the&#xD;
      treatment on everyday functioning, (c) the long term efficacy of the treatment and (c) the&#xD;
      utility of booster sessions in facilitating long-term treatment effects. The investigators&#xD;
      will randomly assign individuals with TBI, with documented impairment in new learning&#xD;
      abilities, to a memory retraining group or a placebo control group. Both groups will undergo&#xD;
      baseline, immediate and long-term follow-up assessment consisting of: (1) a traditional&#xD;
      neuropsychological battery and (2) an assessment of global functioning examining the impact&#xD;
      of the treatment on daily activities. This design will allow us to evaluate the efficacy of&#xD;
      this particular memory retraining technique in a TBI population through the assessment of&#xD;
      cognitive function via a standard evaluation. In addition, the investigators will be able to&#xD;
      draw conclusions regarding the impact of this particular memory remediation program on&#xD;
      everyday life from questionnaires completed by the participant and a significant other.&#xD;
      Optional enrollment in pre/post neuroimaging will also allow us to look at changes in the&#xD;
      brain.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Impairments in higher level cognitive processing, such as new learning and memory, are among&#xD;
      the most common deficits in individuals with Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and such deficits&#xD;
      have been shown to exert significant negative impact on multiple aspects of everyday life,&#xD;
      including occupational and social functioning. Despite these findings, few studies have&#xD;
      attempted to remediate these cognitive deficits in order to improve the everyday functioning&#xD;
      of individuals with TBI&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, we will conduct a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial,&#xD;
      applying a memory rehabilitation technique to a large sample of TBI participants. This&#xD;
      protocol has been well-validated with other neurological populations and preliminary evidence&#xD;
      in support of its use in MS now exists. Individuals with TBI, with documented impairment in&#xD;
      memory and new learning, will be randomly assigned to either a memory retraining group or a&#xD;
      placebo control group. Outcome will be measured through two mechanisms: (1) a traditional&#xD;
      neuropsychological (NP) battery and (2) an assessment of global functioning (AGF) examining&#xD;
      the impact of the treatment on daily activities. Both groups will undergo baseline, immediate&#xD;
      follow-up, and long-term follow-up assessments consisting of a traditional NP evaluation,&#xD;
      which examines objective performance on well-validated measures of cognitive function, and an&#xD;
      AGF, which includes self-report measures of memory abilities, self-efficacy, quality of life,&#xD;
      and occupational functioning. In this way, we will be able to objectively evaluate the&#xD;
      presence or absence of changes in memory performance through a NP assessment, while also&#xD;
      evaluating the impact of this treatment protocol on an individual's everyday life through the&#xD;
      AGF. While most studies evaluating the efficacy of cognitive retraining usually employ a&#xD;
      pre-training and post-training evaluation, such evaluations have been criticized for their&#xD;
      lack of ecological validity. The present design allows the assessment of the efficacy of this&#xD;
      particular memory retraining technique within an TBI population using traditional measures,&#xD;
      as well as the assessment of the impact that such a rehabilitation technique has on everyday&#xD;
      life. In addition, we will include a 6-month follow-up assessment to measure the long-term&#xD;
      impact of this treatment on objective cognitive functioning, through a NP assessment, and&#xD;
      everyday life, through an AGF. Finally, half of the participants in the experimental group&#xD;
      will participate in monthly &quot;booster sessions&quot; following the completion of treatment and we&#xD;
      will evaluate the impact of these sessions on the maintenance of treatment effects over time.&#xD;
      A subset of the sample will also complete pre and post neuroimaging to evaluate changes in&#xD;
      cerebral activation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The documentation of the efficacy of memory retraining in TBI, particularly on everyday&#xD;
      functioning, could have a significant impact on symptom management and quality of life in the&#xD;
      lives of persons. As such, specific aims of the current research protocol are as follows.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. This study will objectively evaluate the clinical utility of a memory retraining&#xD;
      protocol to improve performance on objective tests of new learning and memory in a large&#xD;
      sample of individuals with TBI with documented deficits in this area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. We will increase the generalizability and real life application of assessment&#xD;
      techniques by assessing outcome following cognitive retraining with more global measures of&#xD;
      everyday life. An objective measure of everyday functioning will be included, as well as&#xD;
      numerous subjective measures of everyday functioning, which will be gathered via established&#xD;
      self-report instruments, as well as ratings by a significant other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: This study will evaluate the long-term efficacy of this memory retraining protocol&#xD;
      through the inclusion of a 6-month follow-up assessment. Many cognitive remediation studies&#xD;
      in the literature examine the efficacy of the treatment immediately following program&#xD;
      completion. However, given the time, expense, and labor involved in such intensive treatment,&#xD;
      it is important to demonstrate the long-term efficacy of such a program. The current study&#xD;
      therefore goes beyond the typical protocol length to evaluate the long-term impact such&#xD;
      treatment will have on objective testing and on an individual's daily life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4: We will examine the need for and impact of &quot;booster sessions&quot; following the completion&#xD;
      of treatment. &quot;Booster sessions&quot; have been shown to be efficacious in maximizing the long&#xD;
      term benefit of cognitive retraining in research with other populations. However, the utility&#xD;
      of booster sessions in a TBI population has never been investigated.&#xD;
