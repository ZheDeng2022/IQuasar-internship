  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SB-252263 (Tafenoquine, TQ) is an 8-aminoquinoline (8-AQ) antimalarial drug being developed&#xD;
      by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) and&#xD;
      Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV). TQ is currently being developed for the radical cure of&#xD;
      acute P. vivax malaria in combination with standard doses of CQ, which is 1500 mg over 3&#xD;
      days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current gold standard for radical cure of P. vivax malaria in many areas of the world is&#xD;
      chloroquine (CQ) for clearance of the acute parasitemia immediately followed by primaquine&#xD;
      (PQ) to clear the liver stages of the parasite and prevent disease relapse. The 8-AQ class of&#xD;
      drugs, including PQ, is hemolytic in subjects with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD)&#xD;
      deficiency. The current study will identify a dose of TQ within the target efficacious dose&#xD;
      range that has a hemolytic effect similar to or less than PQ 15 mg OD x 14 days (i.e. ≤&#xD;
      25-30% hemoglobin decline in WHO class III G6PD-deficient subjects).&#xD;
