  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Photodynamic therapy (PDT) uses a combination of a drug, porfimer sodium, and a light from a&#xD;
      non heated laser. The activation of the drug is done by lighting of abnormal areas using a&#xD;
      fiber optic device. The fiber optic device is a very fine fiber (like a fishing line) that&#xD;
      permits transmission of light. The fiber optic device is inserted into a diffusing balloon&#xD;
      device to ensure the good positioning of the fiber optic within the esophagus (food pipe). It&#xD;
      is thought that the size and the flexibility of a new diffusing balloon device could improve&#xD;
      the safety profile of the photodynamic treatment by reducing the risk of narrowing or closure&#xD;
      of the food pipe (esophageal stenosis) sometimes occurring after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of PDT with porfimer sodium&#xD;
      using a new diffusing balloon device for light application in the removal of high-grade&#xD;
      dysplasia (HGD, precancerous change in the food pipe tissue) in Barrett's esophagus (BE).&#xD;
      This study will provide advanced knowledge about phototoxicity (reaction similar to sunburn)&#xD;
      and esophageal stenosis, main risks with this therapy. It will involve 75 patients with HGD&#xD;
      in BE across North America and Europe and will last between 13 and 16 weeks. In addition,&#xD;
      concentrations of porfimer sodium in the esophageal tissue will be analyzed in a subgroup of&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with biopsy-confirmed HGD in BE will be evaluated to confirm eligibility. Prior to&#xD;
      enrollment, all inclusion and exclusion criteria will be verified. Medical procedures&#xD;
      including demographic information, medical/surgical history, concurrent medical conditions,&#xD;
      physical exam (including vital signs, body weight, height, and skin color), degree of&#xD;
      difficulty in swallowing; electrocardiogram, chest X-ray, clinical laboratory testing,&#xD;
      concomitant medication intake and other therapy uses will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive one course of PDT consisting of an intravenous injection of 2.0&#xD;
      mg/kg of porfimer sodium over 3-5 minutes followed by one or two endoscopic laser light&#xD;
      applications. The first laser light application will be performed within 40-50 hours using a&#xD;
      new diffusing balloon catheter. The second laser light application (without a diffusing&#xD;
      balloon catheter) will be performed within 96-120 hours on those areas showing an&#xD;
      insufficient response to the first application. Follow-ups (Weeks 4 and 13) will include some&#xD;
      or all of the following procedures: physical exam; vital signs evaluation; body weight;&#xD;
      endoscopy; skin, degree of difficulty in swallowing and esophageal stenosis assessment; and&#xD;
      clinical laboratory check. All patients will be asked general open questions about any&#xD;
      occurrence of adverse events, change in concurrent medical conditions, use of adjunctive&#xD;
      therapy/procedure, and intake of concomitant medication. All patients will undergo rigorous&#xD;
      systematic endoscopic biopsy surveillance at Week 13 (final visit).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tissue concentration of oligomers (component of porfimer sodium) in normal and abnormal&#xD;
      esophageal tissues will be determined in a subgroup of 12 patients. These patients will&#xD;
      provide esophageal tissue samples before the porfimer sodium injection and on four separate&#xD;
      occasions after the injection (22-26 hour-, 40-50 hour-, 96-120 hour-intervals, and 13&#xD;
      weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be followed for three months.&#xD;
