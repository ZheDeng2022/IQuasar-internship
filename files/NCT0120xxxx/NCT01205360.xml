      The purpose of this study is to determine how manipulation of the programmed intermittent&#xD;
      time interval and volume influences total drug use, quality of analgesia, and patient&#xD;
      satisfaction during maintenance of labor analgesia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Research for the ideal technique of maintaining epidural analgesia after the initial-level&#xD;
      block is ongoing. Continuous infusion techniques, use of more dilute solutions , PCEA , and&#xD;
      different techniques of PCEA like background dosing, none, fixed infusion as background,&#xD;
      variable infusion (computer-integrated), programmed intermittent boluses (PIEBs) and&#xD;
      automated mandatory boluses, have been used. Automated systems designed to administer a small&#xD;
      bolus dose of anaesthetic at programmable intervals may combine the advantages of both manual&#xD;
      bolus and continuous epidural infusion (CEI) systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wong et al compared a PIEB (6 ml of bolus every 30 minutes) with CEI with the assumption that&#xD;
      small frequent boluses may avoid wide fluctuations in sensory levels, commonly seen with&#xD;
      traditional manually administered intermittent boluses and at the same time reduce the total&#xD;
      anesthetic dose as in CEI. Chua and Sia showed that Pain scores were lower and the time to&#xD;
      first manual epidural rescue bolus was longer in parturients assigned to intermittent boluses&#xD;
      compared to continuous epidural infusion of the same solution in the intermittent group.&#xD;
      Fettes and colleagues found that patients required a lower total drug dose and fewer manual&#xD;
      bolus injections when epidural labor analgesia was maintained with automated intermittent&#xD;
      boluses of ropivacaine compared to a continuous infusion. Solutions injected into the&#xD;
      epidural space tend to spread more evenly when injected as a bolus, as compared to a&#xD;
      continuous infusion. Furthermore, studies of epidural opioid analgesia suggest that epidural&#xD;
      bolus administration of lipid soluble opioids (e.g., fentanyl) results in segmental spinal&#xD;
      opioid analgesia, whereas continuous opioid epidural infusion results in systemic opioid&#xD;
      analgesia. The analgesic effects of both epidural fentanyl infusion and epidural fentanyl&#xD;
      bolus were evaluated using a volunteer, double blind, cross-over designs study. Taken&#xD;
      together, the results of these studies suggest that further studies of automated intermittent&#xD;
      bolus injections are indicated, in particular, studies of the optimal bolus time interval and&#xD;
      volume. At one end of the spectrum, a short interval/low volume protocol may mimic a&#xD;
      continuous infusion. At the other end of the spectrum, a long interval/large volume may&#xD;
      negate the inherent safety of a continuous infusion. The purpose of the proposed study is to&#xD;
      determine how manipulation of the programmed intermittent time interval and volume influences&#xD;
      total drug use, quality of analgesia, and patient satisfaction during maintenance of labor&#xD;
      analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current pump technology does not support programmed intermittent bolus administration. The&#xD;
      investigators encouraged the manufacturer to develop these features indigenously and&#xD;
      incorporate them in presently available infusion pumps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study will be carried out in randomly selected sixty uncomplicated full term pregnant&#xD;
      patients, in active labour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After written, informed, valid consent, and administration of five hundred millilitres of&#xD;
      Ringer's lactate intravenously as a preload, epidural catheter will be inserted under aseptic&#xD;
      conditions in an L2-L3 or L3-L4 space through 16 G Tuohy's needle. Epidural space will be&#xD;
      identified through the loss-of-resistance technique. The catheter will be placed, cephaled,&#xD;
      two spaces (3 to 4 cm) above the point of insertion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Its position will be confirmed by administering a test dose of 3 ml of lignocaine (2%) with&#xD;
      adrenaline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A loading-dose mixture of 10 ml of bupivacaine (0.125%) and fentanyl (2 µg/ml) will be&#xD;
      administered epidurally targeting initial sensory block to T 10 level .Additional doses of&#xD;
      Inj.bupivacaine will be administered if required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infusion pump will be attached to the catheter and all patients will be randomly divided in&#xD;
      three groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Group 3-15 : Three millilitres of mixture of bupivacaine (0.125%) with fentanyl (2&#xD;
           µg/ml) injected through epidural catheter every 15 minutes as automated boluses&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Group 4-20: Four millilitres of mixture of bupivacaine (0.125%) with fentanyl (2 µg/ml)&#xD;
           injected through epidural catheter every 20 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Group 6-30: Six millilitres of mixture of bupivacaine (0.125%) with fentanyl (2 µg/ml)&#xD;
           injected through epidural catheter every 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be carried out based on blocking. Blocks of size 3 with treatment&#xD;
      allocation of 1:1:1 for group I, group II and group III will be created. A block of 3&#xD;
      patients will be assigned to one of the blocks created.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For blinding of patient as well observer, the settings of infusion pump will be hidden by&#xD;
      covering it with cloth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The level of sensory blockade will be tested by a pinprick method in midline and motor&#xD;
      blockade will be tested with the modified Bromage scale used by Breen et al.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single dose will be omitted if the sensory block goes higher than T7 or the motor blockade&#xD;
      goes below score 4 as per the Bromage scale. Similarly additional top-ups of 3 ml of 0.125 %&#xD;
      bupivacaine with fentanyl 2 micrograms / ml will be administered if patients get severe break&#xD;
      through pain (VAS pain score &gt; 3)&#xD;
&#xD;
      . Maternal parameters like pulse rate, blood pressure and respiratory rate will be monitored&#xD;
      frequently. FHR will be monitored through tococardiography. Bearing-down ability will be&#xD;
      assessed by asking the patients about the perception of the urge to bear down. Neonates will&#xD;
      be assessed by Apgar score at 1 minute and 5 minutes after birth. The patients will be&#xD;
      observed for any side effects or complications, such as pruritus, nausea and vomiting,&#xD;
      hypotension, a headache, sedation and respiratory depression. Labour analgesic drug&#xD;
      administration will be stopped after delivery and the duration of labour analgesia will be&#xD;
      recorded. The total dose of bupivacaine and fentanyl will be calculated. The quality of&#xD;
      analgesia will be assessed hourly. The patients will be asked about pain relief during the&#xD;
      last hour and will be given scores as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  0 = No pain, pressure or tightening sensation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 = Awareness of pressure or tightening sensation but not painful&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2 = Slight pain or pressure sensation but not distressing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3 = Distressing pain or pressure sensation Even when the patients scored higher for a&#xD;
           very short period, the higher score will be recorded for that hour. All the patients&#xD;
           will be interviewed within 24 hours of delivery by an anaesthetist colleague who will&#xD;
           unaware of the technique used and recorded a linear visual analogue scale (VAS) pain&#xD;
           score on the patient's opinion about overall efficacy of analgesia. On this scale, 0 cm&#xD;
           will indicate no pain and 10 cm will indicate worst pain. They will also ask about the&#xD;
           level of their satisfaction regarding the quality of analgesia, which will be graded as&#xD;
           'excellent', 'good' and 'bad'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be carried out with Stata 11.&#xD;
