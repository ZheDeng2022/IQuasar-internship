    <textblock>
      A previous study has found that the consumption of a high fat, low carbohydrate meal results&#xD;
      in increased feelings of calmness, friendliness and an increase in subjective energy levels&#xD;
      in comparison to a low fat, high carbohydrate meal. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      investigate whether a high fat, low carbohydrate diet for a longer duration (of 2 weeks) can&#xD;
      enhance or sustain these changes in comparison to a low fat, high carbohydrate meal.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Research has shown that consuming breakfasts high in either fat or carbohydrates can affect a&#xD;
      persons memory, mood and ability to concentrate (Benton &amp; Parker, 1998, Politt &amp; Mathews,&#xD;
      1998). Our previous study investigating the effect of a high fat, low carbohydrate (HFLC)&#xD;
      meal in comparison to a low fat, high carbohydrate (LFHC) meal found that the HFLC meal&#xD;
      resulted in significantly increased feelings of calmness, friendliness and a reduction in&#xD;
      feelings of anger, and an increase in subjective energy levels in comparison to a LFHC meal.&#xD;
      However, the chronic effects of a HFLC or LFHC diet has not been studied. This purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to investigate whether a 2 week diet high in either fat or carbohydrates&#xD;
      improves cognition/memory and mood. It is hypothesised that the prolonged feeding of a HFLC&#xD;
      diet will attenuate the response seen after a HFLC meal was provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty healthy women are required to attend the School of Biomedical Sciences on seven&#xD;
      occasions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first visit will involve screening tests for suitability for inclusion in the study and&#xD;
      written, informed consent will be obtained. Weight, height and blood pressure will be&#xD;
      measured and a 5ml blood sample will be collected for full blood count, urea, electrolytes&#xD;
      and random blood glucose assessment. Subjects will be asked to complete questionnaires&#xD;
      regarding general health, eating habits, mood and medical history. Following the screening&#xD;
      visit, subjects will be asked to record their habitual food intake and physical activity&#xD;
      pattern for a 3 day period (2 weekdays and 1 weekend day. They will then attend the&#xD;
      laboratory on 6 further occasions, once for a familiarisation visit and for the 5 study&#xD;
      visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The familiarisation visit is required to ensure that subjects are comfortable and familiar&#xD;
      with using the cognitive tests which will be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be provided with a menu of foods to consume as their evening meal prior to&#xD;
      study visits, based on 30% total energy expenditure. This meal will be based on foods the&#xD;
      subject recorded in the completed food diary and will contain approximately 15% of total&#xD;
      energy from protein, 55% from carbohydrate and 30% from fat. Before study visits subjects&#xD;
      will be instructed to consume this standardised meal as their last meal of the day before&#xD;
      20.00 on the previous evening. After they have consumed this meal they are instructed not to&#xD;
      consume any foods or drinks apart from water until they arrive at the lab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will arrive (fasted) at the lab at 08.00 on the morning of each study visit. A&#xD;
      cannula will be inserted retrograde into a hand vein, after prior infiltration at insertion&#xD;
      site with 1% lidocaine. The hand will be placed in a heated box, and remain there throughout&#xD;
      the trial, to obtain arterialised venous blood samples. The cannula will be kept patent with&#xD;
      a slow infusion of 0.9% saline, and samples will be taken via a three-way tap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will then be either given a HFLC, or a LFHC breakfast, the order being randomised.&#xD;
      The HFLC breakfast will be provided on study days before and after the HFLC diet&#xD;
      intervention, and the LFHC breakfast will be provided on study days before and after the LFHC&#xD;
      diet intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Water will be freely available throughout the day. Every 30 minutes subjects will be asked to&#xD;
      complete a set of visual analogue scales designed to assess subjective mood and satiety, a&#xD;
      15ml blood sample will be taken for the measurement of glucose, insulin, ghrelin, free fatty&#xD;
      acids, glucagon, cholecystokinin (CCK), Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), cortisol, adrenaline&#xD;
      and noradrenaline. A 3ml sample will be taken every 15minutes for the first 90 minutes, for&#xD;
      the analysis of insulin and glucose. A baseline sample for triglycerides and cholesterol will&#xD;
      be taken at the beginning of each study visit. Cognitive tests (measuring attention reaction&#xD;
      times and vigilance) will be completed 0, 45, 90 and 135 minutes minutes after the provision&#xD;
      of breakfast. After 180 minutes, the cannula will be removed and subjects will be free to&#xD;
      leave the lab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be provided with either a HFLC diet or a LFHC diet to consume for 2 weeks.&#xD;
      These diets will be designed to meet subjects energy requirements. After consuming the diet&#xD;
      for 2 weeks (diets will comprise of 3 meals and 3 snacks per day), subjects will return to&#xD;
      the laboratory for the second study visit. Subjects will be provided with a set of visual&#xD;
      analogue scales to complete on days 4, 8 and 12 of the intervention period. Subjects will&#xD;
      then return to their habitual diets for 2 weeks, before completing the second intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will also be asked to come to the laboratory for an additional study visit either 2&#xD;
      days before visit 1 or two days before visit 3, where they will be consume their habitual&#xD;
      breakfast instead of a HFLC or LFHC breakfast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During both the 2 week intervention periods, subjects will be asked to consume only the food&#xD;
      provided, no other drinks, including alcohol and caffeinated drinks, may be consumed. If&#xD;
      subjects are habitual tea/coffee drinkers then they may consume a maximum of 3 cups of&#xD;
      tea/coffee a day (unsweetened, with milk from their daily allocation) and be asked to&#xD;
      maintain this over both arms of the study.&#xD;
