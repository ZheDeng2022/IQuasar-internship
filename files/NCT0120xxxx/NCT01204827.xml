  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with HBeAg negative chronic HBV and evidence of hepatic disease (elevated liver&#xD;
      enzymes or evidence of cirrhosis) who have significant viremia are treated with anti HBV&#xD;
      therapy. Currently the key goals of anti HBV therapy are profound and prolonged viral&#xD;
      suppression and treatment efficacy is assessed by monitoring viral load and liver enzymes.&#xD;
      However these do not always reflect the degree of liver impairment or the degree of&#xD;
      improvement in response to therapy. Sebivo has been accepted in Israel as a first line&#xD;
      therapy for HBeAg negative and HBeAg positive chronic HBV with evidence of liver damage.&#xD;
      Viral load should decrease by 1 log every 3 months, otherwise patients should be offered&#xD;
      add-on or alternative therapy. As the majority of patients in Israel are HBeAg negative&#xD;
      chronic HBV and in order to have homogenous population we will select for our study only&#xD;
      patients with HBeAg negative chronic HBV. The 13C Methacetin breath test, assess liver&#xD;
      function and specifically the function of the microsomal CYP4501A2. It has been shown to&#xD;
      correlate with the degree of liver impairment and with clinical outcomes in both acute and&#xD;
      chronic liver disease. The aim of this study is to determine the utility of the 13C&#xD;
      Methacetin Breath Test to follow up patients with HBeAg negative chronic HBV receiving anti&#xD;
      viral therapy.&#xD;
