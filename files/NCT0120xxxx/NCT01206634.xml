      The objective is to assess the effectiveness of regenerative injection therapy (RIT) to&#xD;
      relieve pain and restore function in patients with knee osteoarthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design is a randomized controlled trial with cross-over. 40 patients with chronic&#xD;
      knee osteoarthritis will be randomly assigned to receive exercise therapy for 32 weeks in&#xD;
      combination with RIT on weeks 0, 4, 8, and 12 or exercise therapy for 32 weeks combined to&#xD;
      RIT on weeks 20, 24, 28 and 32. The primary outcome is the WOMAC score.&#xD;

      The administration of treatment as used in this study was approved by Health Canada and the&#xD;
      study received ethical approbation by the regional health authority Institutional Review&#xD;
      Board. Health Canada number: 9427-B2716-21C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants meeting will be randomized into one of two study groups using opaque sealed&#xD;
      envelopes in blocks of 6. Each envelope contains a description of the intervention of&#xD;
      assignment. For group A, the intervention consists of a conventional physiotherapist&#xD;
      supervised exercise program for 32 weeks in combination with RIT on weeks 0, 4, 8, and 12.&#xD;
      Intervention for group B includes the supervised exercise program for 32 weeks in combination&#xD;
      with RIT on weeks 20, 24, 28 and 32 of follow-up. For all study participants, the exercise&#xD;
      program consists of 4 strengthening exercises for which participants will be asked to perform&#xD;
      3 sets of 10 repetitions daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RIT injections: The osteo-tendinous junction of both insertion sites of the collateral&#xD;
      ligaments will be identified. Patients will then receive injections of 1cc of a 15% dextrose&#xD;
      and 0.6% lidocaine solution free of adrenaline in each of eight administration sites in the&#xD;
      collateral ligaments. A 5 cc injection of a 20% dextrose and 0.5% lidocaine without&#xD;
      adrenaline solution will also be administered inside the knee joint. The intra-articular&#xD;
      injection will be performed using the anterior approach. Solutions are prepared by a hospital&#xD;
      pharmacist the morning of the injections. Each infiltration will be preceded by a local&#xD;
      sterilization consisting of three disinfections with a 2% chlorexidine and 4% idopropyl&#xD;
      alcohol solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study variables Several measures of functional capacity and pain are used. The primary&#xD;
      outcome is the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index of severity of&#xD;
      osteoarthrosis symptoms (WOMAC version 3.1). This self-administered questionnaire assesses&#xD;
      pain, disability and joint stiffness using 24 items with 5-point Likert scales. Other&#xD;
      outcomes included the Brief Pain Inventory (short form), which is administered to assess pain&#xD;
      intensity and pain-related functional impairment (physical and emotional). More specifically,&#xD;
      four items assess the intensity of current pain and pain at its least, worst, and average&#xD;
      during the past day on scales from 0 (&quot;no pain&quot;) to 10 (&quot;pain as bad as you can imagine&quot;).&#xD;
      Seven more items measure pain-related functional interference in different domains (general&#xD;
      activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other people, sleep, and&#xD;
      enjoyment of life) rated from 0 (&quot;does not interfere&quot;) to 10 (&quot;interferes completely&quot;).&#xD;
      Participants will also rate their pain with the Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale, a series&#xD;
      of 6 faces anchored at 0 for &quot;no hurt&quot; and 5 for &quot;hurts worst&quot;. After being instructed that&#xD;
      each face is for a person who feels happy because he has no pain or sad because he has some&#xD;
      or a lot of pain, participants chose the face that best describes how they feel. Participants&#xD;
      also rate their pain with a simple descriptive intensity scale with 7 adjectives (no pain,&#xD;
      mild pain, moderate pain, severe pain, very severe pain, and worst pain possible), a numeric&#xD;
      distress scale with anchors 0 for &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 for &quot;unbearable pain&quot;, and a visual&#xD;
      analogue scale with the words &quot;no pain&quot; and &quot;pain as bad as could possibly be&quot; at the left&#xD;
      and right ends of the line, respectively. The Timed Up-and-Go Test will be used to evaluate&#xD;
      functional capacity. Participants start in a sitting position (with hands resting on the arms&#xD;
      of an armchair of standard height), stand up, walke 3 meters, turn around, and walk back to&#xD;
      sit down on the chair again. The timing starts when the participant's back comes off the&#xD;
      chair, and stops when their buttocks touch the seat of the chair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients' severity of knee osteoarthritis will be assessed by a radiologist using the&#xD;
      Kellgren-Lawrence grading scale. Anteroposterior radiographs of the knee are to be taken&#xD;
      prior to enrollment in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up Participants will meet with research assistants (research nurses and family&#xD;
      medicine residents) at the onset of the study, every four weeks of the subsequent 32 weeks of&#xD;
      intervention, and four weeks after the intervention. At each of those visits, participants&#xD;
      will be asked to fill in measurement questionnaires. Research assistants will also&#xD;
      investigate the presence of side effects or complications and remind participants that the&#xD;
      research protocol restricts them from taking any anti-inflammatory medication throughout the&#xD;
      32 weeks of intervention. Participants will also meet the physiotherapist every four weeks to&#xD;
      review exercises. At the onset of the study, participants will receive a study calendar&#xD;
      detailing each of their appointments. In addition, patients will receive an appointment card&#xD;
      at the end of each visit. This card provides the time of the next visit, contact information,&#xD;
      as well as a list of conditions for which participants should contact the study center. If a&#xD;
      participant presents a sustained deterioration of symptoms or function, or experiences&#xD;
      undesirable side effects, the presumed contributing part of the treatment will be&#xD;
      discontinued.&#xD;
