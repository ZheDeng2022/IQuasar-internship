      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of aerobic fitness training on mental health&#xD;
      (health-related quality of life),cognitive and physical capacity in older people discharge&#xD;
      from hospital and to assess if further aerobic training at home enhances the effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Randomized controlled trial conducted at Oslo University Hospital, department of&#xD;
      Medicine in conjunction with Oslo University College. The subjects will be randomized into&#xD;
      one intervention group (training group) or one control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health-related quality of life Physical function Cognitive capacity Physical activity Body&#xD;
      composition Physical activity level&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Research has indicated that participation in a regular exercise program is an effective&#xD;
      intervention to maintain and enhance cognitive and physical function in older&#xD;
      individuals.Despite good evidence regarding the positive effects of exercise, a sedentary or&#xD;
      inactive lifestyle is common among people over 65 years of old, especially among persons with&#xD;
      chronic diseases. Research shows that good mental health and physical capacity is of vital&#xD;
      importance for living independently in the community and we know that participation in&#xD;
      physical activity offers good opportunities to extend years of active independent life.&#xD;
      Nevertheless our knowledge is sparse regarding the evidence of effective programs for health&#xD;
      promotion in groups of elderly, especially after discharge from hospital. Our knowledge is&#xD;
      also sparse as to which intervention program is the most effective, group-based training or&#xD;
      home- based training.&#xD;

    <description>Group-based Aerobic Interval Training twice a week in 12 weeks, based on the Ulleval model. The Norwegian Ulleval Model is a group-based aerobic interval training program which is widely used in Scandinavian hospitals for patients with coronary disease. It is designed to improve physical capacity, body awareness and emotional well-being.</description>
