      Background :&#xD;
&#xD;
      In malignant gliomas, hypoxia is associated with tumour angiogenesis and tumour progression.&#xD;
      This multidisciplinary preclinical and clinical project aims to validate the use of 18F-FMISO&#xD;
      as a hypoxic marker for diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of malignant gliomas. Indeed,&#xD;
      non-invasive methods of imagery such as Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and biological&#xD;
      methods (after surgical resection) to detect the endogenous expression of factors induced by&#xD;
      the hypoxia would allow to identify hypoxic areas. Identifying, with accuracy, the hypoxic&#xD;
      areas could allow the clinicians to evaluate the response to the anti-angiogenic agents&#xD;
      (preliminary validation in the preclinical project) and to optimize the combination of the&#xD;
      anti-VEGF treatments with other conventional therapeutic approaches (radiotherapy,&#xD;
      chemotherapy or other molecules).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research project :&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research project includes 3 steps : first the investigators will establish the 18F-FMISO&#xD;
      production technique for clinical application at CYCERON PET center. The second step consists&#xD;
      in the preclinical validation of 18F-FMISO as a hypoxic marker and as a powerful tool for&#xD;
      evaluating the therapeutical efficiency of anti-angiogenic treatment (sutent) in experimental&#xD;
      rat gliomas. The third step is the clinical trial HypOnco. This research proposal aims to&#xD;
      develop and use non invasive imaging methods (18F-FMISO with PET) and biological methods&#xD;
      (after surgical resection) to detect hypoxic (HIF1 and HIF2) and angiogenic (VEGF and EPO)&#xD;
      regions in different malignant gliomas with different degrees of vascularization (15 patients&#xD;
      with grade III gliomas and 15 patients with grade IV glioblastomas). Within the same patient&#xD;
      18F-FMISO as a hypoxic index will be performed. A magnetic resonance imaging examination&#xD;
      (MRI) including perfusion sequences and MR spectroscopy will also be assessed for each&#xD;
      patient. Following this imaging protocol, surgical resection will be performed allowing us to&#xD;
      study expression of endogenous factors induced by hypoxia and angiogenic factors by real time&#xD;
      RT-PCR and in immunohistochemistry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data obtained will enable us to establish :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a hypoxic index (18F-FMISO with PET).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  an index of hypoxic factor expression (HIFs)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  an angiogenic index (VEGF, EPO, vascular markers)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will characterize the links between these data and also with the following&#xD;
      parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  clinical (age, Karnofsky performance status, survival)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MR parameters included perfusion and spectroscopy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  histological (necrosis, cellular proliferation, atypical cell abnormalities,&#xD;
           vascularization).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results and clinical advantages&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To establish the 18F-FMISO production technique&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To propose the 18F-FMISO as a non-invasive marker for efficacy of antiangiogenic&#xD;
           treatment in a preclinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To define the relationship between the 18F-FMISO uptake and tumour grade, patient&#xD;
           survival, tumour recurrence, expression of hypoxic and angiogenic factors and tumour&#xD;
           vascularisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To provide a hypoxic index in cerebral tumours from 18F-FMISO PET, allowing diagnosis&#xD;
           and prognosis improvement for optimal treatment orientation and strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the field of the clinical applications, this tool will allow to :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Optimize radiotherapy treatment by identifying with accuracy, using 18F-FMISO PET, the&#xD;
           most hypoxic areas which are also the most radio resistant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate antiangiogenic therapy efficacy&#xD;
