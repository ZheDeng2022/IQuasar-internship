  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of RO4929097 when given&#xD;
      together with letrozole in treating post-menopausal women with stage II or stage III breast&#xD;
      cancer. RO4929097 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed&#xD;
      for cell growth. Estrogen can cause the growth of breast cancer cells. Hormone therapy using&#xD;
      letrozole may fight breast cancer by blocking the use of estrogen by the tumor cells. Giving&#xD;
      RO4929097 together with letrozole may be an effective treatment for breast cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To establish the maximum-tolerated dose and the recommended phase II dose of&#xD;
      gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 (RO4929097) in combination with letrozole in&#xD;
      post-menopausal women with hormone receptor-positive stage II or III breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the safety of this regimen in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of this regimen, taking into consideration the induction&#xD;
      of CYP3A4, in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To characterize the pharmacodynamic effects of letrozole prior to and during&#xD;
      administration of RO4929097 with attention to suppression of estradiol and estrone levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To describe the pharmacodynamic effects of letrozole with or without RO4929097 on the&#xD;
      NOTCH pathway, proliferation, angiogenesis, stromal cell infiltration/pathways, and&#xD;
      comprehensive genomic analysis in tumor tissue of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To describe the response, including clinical complete or partial objective response,&#xD;
      pathological complete response, and attainment of pathologic stage 0 or I status in these&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of gamma-secretase inhibitor&#xD;
      RO4929097(RO4929097).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive oral letrozole once daily on days 1-21. Beginning in course 2, patients also&#xD;
      receive oral RO4929097 on days 1-3, 8-10, and 15-18. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6&#xD;
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beginning 1 week after completion of neoadjuvant therapy, patients undergo surgery or tumor&#xD;
      biopsy. Patients continue to receive oral letrozole once daily during surgery and for an&#xD;
      additional 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and tumor tissue samples are collected at baseline and periodically during study for&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and correlative studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up for 1 month and then every 6&#xD;
      months for 5 years.&#xD;
