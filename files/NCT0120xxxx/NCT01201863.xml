    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to address 3 short term objectives; (1) Determine the effects&#xD;
      of physiologic testosterone (T) therapy on neurological function and functional independence&#xD;
      following traumatic brain injury (TBI) in hypogonadal men during inpatient rehabilitation;&#xD;
      (2) Document the natural history of neuroendocrine dysfunction and recovery in men during&#xD;
      inpatient rehabilitation after TBI; (3) Obtain data to validate the NIH toolbox, a novel&#xD;
      assessment of neurological function for use in the TBI population; and 2 long-term&#xD;
      objectives: (1) Utilize study findings to design a multicenter trial to further assess the&#xD;
      impact of T therapy in hypogonadal men following TBI and (2) Impact TBI practice management&#xD;
      with new information about neuroendocrine dysfunction after TBI and hormone treatments to&#xD;
      improve outcomes.&#xD;

      This randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled pilot study assessed the hormonal status of&#xD;
      men on admission to an inpatient TBI rehabilitation program. 498 consecutively admitted men&#xD;
      for TBI rehabilitation were screened for participation in the study. 22 participants with low&#xD;
      T who met all criteria were randomized into placebo (n=10), or physiologic T therapy (n=12).&#xD;
      Of those with normal T who met all criteria, 24 were randomized into a follow up group. All&#xD;
      participants were evaluated every two weeks for up to 12 weeks: hormone levels, FIM ratings&#xD;
      and NIH Toolbox testing as able. There was participant drop out over time as participants&#xD;
      were discharged from the hospital. The final analysis examined differences between the normal&#xD;
      T, low T Treatment and low T placebo groups on hormone levels, FIM ratings and NIH Toolbox&#xD;
      results at baseline and weeks 2, 4 and 6.&#xD;

    <description>The FIM is the most widely accepted functional assessment measure in use in the rehabilitation community in the US. It is an 18-item ordinal clinician rating scale that is useful for assessment of functional skills progress during inpatient rehabilitation. It measures levels of independent/dependent performance of 13 motor functions and 5 cognitive functions. By adding the points for each item, the possible total score ranges from 18 to 126, with higher numbers indicating better performance. A restricted FIM total score that eliminated the toileting, bladder management and bowel management items was computed and used in the final analysis with scores ranging from 14-105). The restricted FIM total score was used as the primary outcome measure.</description>

        <title>Restricted Functional Independence Measure (FIM)</title>
        <description>The FIM is the most widely accepted functional assessment measure in use in the rehabilitation community in the US. It is an 18-item ordinal clinician rating scale that is useful for assessment of functional skills progress during inpatient rehabilitation. It measures levels of independent/dependent performance of 13 motor functions and 5 cognitive functions. By adding the points for each item, the possible total score ranges from 18 to 126, with higher numbers indicating better performance. A restricted FIM total score that eliminated the toileting, bladder management and bowel management items was computed and used in the final analysis with scores ranging from 14-105). The restricted FIM total score was used as the primary outcome measure.</description>
        <time_frame>Administered at baseline and every other week for up to 12 weeks with 7 total possible administrations.</time_frame>
