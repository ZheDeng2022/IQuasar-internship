  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK1325756 is a potent, competitive, selective and reversible CXCR2 receptor antagonist that&#xD;
      is being developed as a once-daily oral anti-inflammatory medication for the treatment of&#xD;
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Selective antagonism of the interaction between&#xD;
      CXCR2 and its various chemokine ligands is a potential strategy for reducing the underlying&#xD;
      inflammation in COPD via the inhibition of neutrophil recruitment and activation. The current&#xD;
      study explores the effects of age, gender and food (high fat meal) on the pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      GSK1325756.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because a significant proportion of COPD subjects are prescribed proton pump inhibitors&#xD;
      (PPI's) such as omeprazole in order to alleviate symptoms of gastro-esophageal reflux disease&#xD;
      (GERD), it is important to understand the absorption of the current formulation of GSK1325756&#xD;
      in an environment of raised intra-gastric pH as will be encountered in patients taking PPI's.&#xD;
      Therefore, this study will also evaluate the impact of the proton pump inhibitor omeprazole&#xD;
      on the pharmacokinetics of GSK1325756.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Healthy as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical&#xD;
             evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and&#xD;
             cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters&#xD;
             outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if&#xD;
             the Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to&#xD;
             introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures and&#xD;
             study objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
             However, subjects taking a stable dose of anti-hypertensive medication for at least 3&#xD;
             months prior to enrollment may be included if the Investigator and the GSK Medical&#xD;
             Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and&#xD;
             will not interfere with the study procedures and study objectives. In all cases,&#xD;
             subjects should have a resting BP of 140/90 irrespective of anti-hypertensive&#xD;
             medication status.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Subjects taking a stable dose of lipid lowering medications (statins or fibrates) for&#xD;
             at least 3 months prior to enrollment may be included if the Investigator and the GSK&#xD;
             Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk&#xD;
             factors and will not interfere with the study procedures and study objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of non-childbearing potential&#xD;
             defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or&#xD;
             postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable cases a&#xD;
             blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) more than 40 MlU/ml&#xD;
             and estradiol less than 40 pg/ml (less than 140 pmol/L) is confirmatory]. Females on&#xD;
             hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be&#xD;
             required to use one of the contraception methods in Section 8.1 if they wish to&#xD;
             continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow&#xD;
             confirmation of post-menopausal status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of&#xD;
             HRT, at least 2-4 weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood&#xD;
             draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of&#xD;
             their post-menopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use&#xD;
             of a contraceptive method.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Male subjects must agree to use one of the contraception methods listed in Section&#xD;
             8.1. This criterion must be followed from the time of the first dose of study&#xD;
             medication until least 3-months post-last dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Body weight more than or equal to 60 kg (110 lbs) for men and more than or equal to 45&#xD;
             kg (99lbs) for women and BMI within the range 19-32 kg/m2 inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the&#xD;
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Willingness to complete all study procedures and complete all planned treatment&#xD;
             periods and follow up assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7.12 lead ECG without any clinically significant abnormality as judged by the Investigator,&#xD;
        and average QTcB or QTcF less than 450 msec 8.AST and ALT less than 2xULN; alkaline&#xD;
        phosphatase and bilirubin less than 1.5xULN (isolated bilirubin more than 1.5xULN is&#xD;
        acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin less than 35%).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. A positive pre-study Hepatitis B surface antigen or positive Hepatitis C antibody&#xD;
             result within 3 months of screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. A neutrophil count at screening of less than 2 x 109/L&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities&#xD;
             (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. A positive pre-study drug/alcohol screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. A positive test for HIV antibody.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. History of regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of the study defined as an&#xD;
             average weekly intake of more than 14 drinks for males or more than 7 drinks for&#xD;
             females. One drink is equivalent to 12 g of alcohol: 12 ounces (360 ml) of beer, 5&#xD;
             ounces (150 ml) of wine or 1.5 ounces (45 ml) of 80 proof distilled spirits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational&#xD;
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current&#xD;
             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the&#xD;
             investigational product (whichever is longer).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first&#xD;
             dosing day.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Use of prescription or non-prescription drugs, including vitamins, herbal and dietary&#xD;
             supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days (or 14 days if the drug is a&#xD;
             potential enzyme inducer) or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first&#xD;
             dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and GSK Medical&#xD;
             Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study procedures,s compromise&#xD;
             subject safety, or interfere with the objectives of the study. All concomitant&#xD;
             medications should be queried with the GSK Medical Monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a&#xD;
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK&#xD;
             Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products&#xD;
             in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day period.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Pregnant females as determined by positive serum or urine hCG test at screening or&#xD;
