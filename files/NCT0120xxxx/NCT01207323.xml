  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, multicenter, open-label study of MEHD7945A in participants with incurable,&#xD;
      locally advanced, or metastatic epithelial malignancies that have progressed despite standard&#xD;
      therapy or for which no standard therapy exists. The study will be conducted in two stages: a&#xD;
      dose escalation stage and an expansion stage. The dose-escalation stage is designed to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK of MEHD7945A administered (at five dose levels from&#xD;
      1 to 30 milligrams per kilogram [mg/kg]) every 2 week (Q2W). An expansion stage will be&#xD;
      initiated after establishment of maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in dose escalation stage.&#xD;
      Participants with refractory or recurrent metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC), non-small cell&#xD;
      lung cancer (NSCLC), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), and pancreatic cancer&#xD;
      will be enrolled in an expansion stage to better characterize the safety, tolerability, PK&#xD;
      and preliminary assessment of the anti-tumor activity of MEHD7945A.&#xD;
