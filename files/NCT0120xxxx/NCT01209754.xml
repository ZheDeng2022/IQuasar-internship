      The Prevention Agent Pregnancy Exposure Registry, also known as EMBRACE (Evaluation of&#xD;
      Maternal and Baby Outcome Registry After Chemoprophylactic Exposure) is a prospective&#xD;
      observational cohort investigation of exposures to study agents under investigation for HIV&#xD;
      prevention. The study population will consist of female participants who are identified as&#xD;
      becoming pregnant during their participation in a microbicide or PrEP trial, or who have had&#xD;
      planned exposures in pregnancy safety studies as well as their babies resulting from these&#xD;
      pregnancies. This study will only enroll babies who have not yet reached their 1 year birth&#xD;
      date.&#xD;

      The Prevention Agent Pregnancy Exposure Registry, also known as EMBRACE (Evaluation of&#xD;
      Maternal and Baby Outcome Registry After Chemoprophylactic Exposure) is a prospective&#xD;
      observational cohort study of maternal exposures to investigational HIV prevention agents.&#xD;
      Approximately 550 pregnant participants and 400 live infants will be offered enrollment. The&#xD;
      study population will consist of current or recent female participants identified as becoming&#xD;
      pregnant during microbicide or PrEP trials, or who have had planned exposures in pregnancy&#xD;
      safety studies. This study will also include infants resulting from those pregnancies. This&#xD;
      protocol will monitor for adverse pregnancy and delivery outcomes, monitor the prevalence of&#xD;
      major malformations, evaluate growth parameters of infants during the first year of life, and&#xD;
      evaluate the prevalence and persistence of HIV drug resistance mutations in a cohort of&#xD;
      infants who were either exposed to active study agents or not exposed to active study agents&#xD;
      while in utero.&#xD;

        The study population will consist of female participants who become or became pregnant&#xD;
        during HIV prevention agent trials, or who have or had planned exposures in pregnancy&#xD;
        safety studies, and the infants resulting from those pregnancies. Mother participants must&#xD;
        still be pregnant, or have had a pregnancy outcome diagnosis less than one year before&#xD;
        screening/enrollment, and infant participants must be less than one year old. The study may&#xD;
        include HIV-uninfected and -infected participants. Mothers may participate in EMBRACE&#xD;
        without participation of their infants; however, infants whose mothers have not enrolled in&#xD;
        EMBRACE will not participate.&#xD;
