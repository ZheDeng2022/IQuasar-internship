    <textblock>
      The aim of the current study is to investigate the ability of antioxidants found in cocoa&#xD;
      ('flavanols') to increase the body's sensitivity to the hormone insulin. 32 overweight or&#xD;
      mildly obese women, who are otherwise healthy, will be recruited. Subjects will attend the&#xD;
      laboratory on 3 occasions after fasting from midnight. The 1st visit is a medical screening,&#xD;
      with laboratory visits 2 and 3 separated by 4 weeks, during which time subjects will consume&#xD;
      a cocoa drink (containing either high or low amounts of flavanols) twice a day. Subjects will&#xD;
      record their food intake for 3-days before visit 2 and in week 3 of consuming the cocoa. They&#xD;
      will also eat a diet of standard macronutrient composition for 3 days before visits 2 and 3.&#xD;
      During the 5 hour laboratory visits, subjects will have a scan to assess their body&#xD;
      composition using a low-dose x-ray machine (Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry; DEXA), and have&#xD;
      their insulin sensitivity measured using a 3 hour hyperinsulinemic, euglycaemic Clamp.&#xD;

      Background; Overweight and mild obesity are associated with insulin resistance and mild&#xD;
      elevations in lipid risk factors which are not usually sufficiently abnormal to merit&#xD;
      treatment. Such people are encouraged to lose weight to reduce their risk of progressing to&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease, but there is clearly a potential role for dietary&#xD;
      modifications to maximize any potential benefit of this weight loss. Cocoa flavanols (CF) are&#xD;
      known to have vascular effects which might enhance substrate delivery to metabolically active&#xD;
      tissues, and thus improve insulin sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims; This randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel design study aims to&#xD;
      investigate the longer term effects of CF intake on insulin sensitivity. It is hypothesized&#xD;
      that studying otherwise healthy overweight and mildly obese subjects, with evidence of&#xD;
      fasting insulin resistance, would show whether there was potential benefit of CF in an 'at&#xD;
      risk' population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental protocol and methods; 32 overweight or obese women (Body Mass Index 27-35), who&#xD;
      are otherwise healthy, will be recruited onto the study. They will attend the 'David&#xD;
      Greenfield Human Physiology' laboratories on 3 convenient mornings, following an overnight&#xD;
      fast. The 1st visit is a medical screening and will involve signing a consent form,&#xD;
      completing a medical screening and food frequency questionnaire, having height, weight,&#xD;
      hip/waist circumference measurements taken and a 10ml sample of blood taken for routine&#xD;
      analysis. Subjects will then be asked to complete a 3-day diet diary for macronutrient&#xD;
      assessment and to consume a diet providing 50% of energy as carbohydrate for 3 days prior to&#xD;
      the 2nd laboratory visit. This 2nd visit will involve having a DEXA body composition scan and&#xD;
      a 3-hour hyperinsulinaemic, euglycaemic glucose clamp. Starting on the following morning,&#xD;
      subjects will then consume a cocoa drink (containing either 450mg or 25mg of CF) twice a day&#xD;
      for 28 days. A 3-day diet diary for macronutrient assessment will be recorded during week 3&#xD;
      of taking the cocoa and a standardized diet will be consumed for 3 days prior to the final&#xD;
      laboratory visit, as before. This 3rd visit will be identical to visit 2 and occur&#xD;
      immediately after 28days of taking the cocoa.&#xD;

      body weight.min), Respiratory exchange ratio, Resting metabolic rate, Homeostatic model&#xD;
