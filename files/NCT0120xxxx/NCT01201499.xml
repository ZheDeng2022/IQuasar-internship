      Inadequate pain control after abdominal procedures may lead to adverse postoperative outcome.&#xD;
      Epidural analgesia is currently an accepted technique in abdominal surgery, but its use has&#xD;
      been limited in liver resections by postoperative coagulation disturbances and the possible&#xD;
      increased risk of bleeding complications, including spinal hematoma. A range of alternative&#xD;
      analgesic techniques can be used for major liver or pancreatic resections, including&#xD;
      intrathecal morphine (single shot) administered immediately before surgery, and continuous&#xD;
      administration of intravenous (IV) short-acting opioids, such as remifentanil, plus a single&#xD;
      bolus of IV morphine. Postoperatively analgesia may be obtained by patient-controlled&#xD;
      morphine analgesia (IV PCA). Both protocols have been demonstrated to provide satisfactory&#xD;
      postoperative pain relief, and each has its unique advantages. However, to this end there is&#xD;
      no data in the literature to show benefit from one regimen over the other. We therefore wish&#xD;
      to determine whether there is a difference in analgesic efficacy between the two techniques,&#xD;
      as optimizing perioperative pain relief in this rapidly expanding surgical field is of utmost&#xD;
      importance. Our hypothesis is that continuous intraoperative IV analgesia with remifentanil&#xD;
      followed by IV PCA morphine is not inferior to intrathecal morphine with respect to analgesia&#xD;
      and ambulation outcome, and may provide an alternative, non-invasive intraoperative analgesic&#xD;
      technique.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND Inadequate pain control after abdominal procedures might result in increased&#xD;
      morbidity, length of stay, and delay in overall recovery. Epidural analgesia is currently an&#xD;
      accepted technique in major abdominal surgery [1-4]. Postoperative coagulation disturbances&#xD;
      related to liver surgery, even in patients with normal preoperative coagulation undergoing&#xD;
      uncomplicated hepatectomy, raises concerns about the safety of postoperative analgesia&#xD;
      administered through an epidural catheter. Coagulation changes after liver surgery and the&#xD;
      possible increased risk of bleeding complications, including spinal hematoma, have limited&#xD;
      the use of epidural analgesia [5-7].&#xD;
&#xD;
      A range of alternative analgesic techniques can be used for major liver or pancreatic&#xD;
      resections. A single dose of intrathecal morphine (ITM), administered immediately before&#xD;
      surgery, followed by postoperative patient-controlled morphine analgesia (IV PCA), has been&#xD;
      demonstrated to provide satisfactory postoperative pain relief which was not inferior to&#xD;
      continuous epidural analgesia up to 48 hours after hepatic surgery [8, 9]. Another study in&#xD;
      patients undergoing hepato-pancreato-biliary surgery has shown that ITM, compared with&#xD;
      thoracic epidural analgesia, is associated with a reduced incidence of postoperative&#xD;
      hypotension, intravenous fluid requirements, hospitalization, and incidence of respiratory&#xD;
      complications [10]. Alternatively, few reports have demonstrated the advantage of using&#xD;
      continuous administration of intravenous (IV) short-acting opioids, such as remifentanil.&#xD;
      This regime has been shown to facilitate earlier extubation, to provide excellent&#xD;
      intraoperative hemodynamic stability and rapid recovery [11]. Nevertheless, as remifentanil&#xD;
      is rapidly metabolized, there is a need at the end of surgery to initiate another&#xD;
      post-operative pain strategy to prevent unacceptable pain in the post-operative period. This&#xD;
      has been accomplished by the administration of morphine which has been shown to provide an&#xD;
      effective postoperative pain control (a bolus followed by IV PCA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, these two analgesic regimens (ITM vs. continuous IV remifentanil) are frequently&#xD;
      used in our institution. Nevertheless, there is no data in the literature to show benefit&#xD;
      from one regimen over the other. We therefore wish to determine whether there is a difference&#xD;
      in analgesic efficacy between the two techniques as optimizing perioperative pain relief in&#xD;
      this rapidly expanding surgical field is of utmost importance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS Study design The study will be conducted as a prospective, randomized, double blinded&#xD;
      one. Intra-operatively, anesthesia and surgical management will follow the routines.&#xD;
      Intravenous fluid and blood supplements will be administered according to the&#xD;
      anesthesiologists' decision. Also, the decision to extubate the patient at the end of surgery&#xD;
      will be left to the discretion of the anesthesiologist. Post-operatively, all patients will&#xD;
      be transferred to the ICU or to the recovery room for at least 24 hours. Patients may also be&#xD;
      transferred first to the recovery room and than to the ICU. These are the routines in our&#xD;
      hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consented patients will be randomly allocated to two groups by a computer-generated list:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 will receive a single dose of intrathecal morphine (ITM, 4 µcg/kg, or ~0.1-0.3 mg&#xD;
      morphine)[10, 12-14] before induction of general anesthesia, followed by postoperative&#xD;
      patient-controlled morphine analgesia (IV-PCA) for postoperative pain. Intra-operatively,&#xD;
      hemodynamic changes indicative of pain will be treated with intravenous remifentanil (see&#xD;
      below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 will be administered with a continuous infusion of IV remifentanil supported by a&#xD;
      single bolus of IV morphine, 0.2 mg/kg at the end of surgery, followed by IV-PCA morphine&#xD;
      [15, 16].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed for three days post-operatively. The primary endpoint of this study&#xD;
      is postoperative pain, which will be evaluated by several parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A subjective visual analogue pain score (VAS, scale 0-10 cm) during rest, while&#xD;
           coughing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Time to first postoperative request of analgesia (from IV PCA).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Cumulative postoperative analgesia consumption (demand/delivery ratio).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Need for supplementary of alternative analgesia&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary endpoints will include levels of sedation, using the Wilson sedation score&#xD;
      [17], length of time with indwelling urinary catheter, time to ambulation (sitting, walking),&#xD;
      length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) and total length of hospitalization, time to&#xD;
      extubation, need for re-intubation and analgesia-related adverse effects (see detailed&#xD;
      patients' assessment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient assessment All patients will be assessed in the first three postoperative days by the&#xD;
      acute pain service during the morning hours (7-10am).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain control will be assessed according to the following measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  VAS [ranging from &quot;0&quot; (no pain) to &quot;10&quot; (worst imaginable pain)] in the morning (between&#xD;
           7-10am) and afternoon (between 13-15) on POD 1,2,3. Pain will be evaluated at rest and&#xD;
           during coughing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The rate of IV-PCA activation (i.e., the number of times the delivery button was&#xD;
           pressed) will be recorded daily (including within the lockout period), in order to&#xD;
           evaluate both the demand and the consumption of postoperative analgesia, and document&#xD;
           those patients whose analgesic needs were not fulfilled (with an activation-to-delivery&#xD;
           rate ratio &gt;1.5) [18].&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cumulative morphine consumption will be assessed every 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The time of first request of postoperative analgesia and any need of extra boluses of&#xD;
           analgesia or rescue drug (including dosages) will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any opioid-related complications: respiratory depression (defined as hypoventilation,&#xD;
           hypercapnia, and respiratory acidosis. Clinically manifested when PaCO2&gt;60mmHg, and&#xD;
           blood pH&lt;7.25); nausea/vomiting; pruritus; sedation; allergic events.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any spinal-related complications will be recorded, e.g. postdural puncture headache.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intraoperative hemodynamic and/or respiratory complications; time to extubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The time to ambulation (sitting, walking), and dependence on indwelling urinary catheter&#xD;
           will be recorded..&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sedation levels will be measured with the Wilson sedation scale (1, fully awake and&#xD;
           oriented; 2,drowsy; 3, eyes closed, but rousable with command; 4, eyes closed, but&#xD;
           rousable with mild physical stimulation; 5, eyes closed, not rousable with mild physical&#xD;
           stimulation) will be recorded at times of pain assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Overall patients' satisfaction with pain relief will be evaluated with a 4-stage scale&#xD;
           (&quot;very good,&quot; &quot;good,&quot; &quot;moderate,&quot; or &quot;bad&quot;) once daily, during afternoon visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Additional data we will record include demographics (age, gender, weight, ASA),&#xD;
           operative data (e.g. duration of surgery, amount of fluids and blood administered).&#xD;
