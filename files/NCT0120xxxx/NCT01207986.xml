      Early Lung Cancer diagnosis in a HIV-infected population with an important smoking history&#xD;
      with low-dose CT: a pilot study: the HIV-CHEST study Objectives The main objective of this&#xD;
      study is to evaluate the prevalence of lung cancers detected by low-dose computed tomography&#xD;
      (CT) in a HIV-infected population with an important smoking history. Other objectives are (1)&#xD;
      the evaluation of the types of lung cancers in this population, as well as (2) the staging of&#xD;
      non small cell lung cancers, (3) the description of risk factors for all lung cancers, if&#xD;
      they are numerous enough, and (4) the number of complications of diagnosis procedures during&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;

      Background Epidemiological studies in France and in the western world have shown that lung&#xD;
      cancers are the first cause of mortality amongst the non-AIDS classifying cancers in&#xD;
      HIV-infected individuals, despite the introduction of combination antiretroviral therapies.&#xD;
      Compared to the general population, there is an increased risk of lung cancer in HIV-infected&#xD;
      individuals, even after adjustment on smoking and age, estimated to be around 2.6 compared to&#xD;
      the general population. Outcomes are dismal, as diagnoses in HIV-infected individuals are&#xD;
      usually made at very advanced stages (usually stage III or IV) without screening. Two&#xD;
      non-randomized studies of CT-screening in a non HIV-infected population exposed to smoking&#xD;
      have shown an important rate of early lung cancer detection and a high level of survival at 5&#xD;
      or 10 years. Despite a probable high prevalence of lung cancer in the HIV-infected&#xD;
      population, no lung cancer screening or early diagnosis studies have been realised, and the&#xD;
      prevalence is yet to be determined. We deduced from different studies of non HIV-infected&#xD;
      populations a 3% prevalence in the HIV-infected population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Prospective multicentric and national study evaluating the prevalence of lung cancers&#xD;
      through low-dose CT of 450 individuals with a known HIV-infection, with a nadir level of TCD4&#xD;
      cells &lt; 350/µl, ≥ 40 years old and with a smoking history ≥ 20 packs a year (either active or&#xD;
      with &lt;3 years of weaning). CT interpretations and lung biopsies are guided by a suggested&#xD;
      workup algorithm, which is not imposed in each HIV-caring centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion and follow up period Inclusion period will be 9 months, followed, in case of the&#xD;
      discovery of a small nodule, by a CT follow up scheme of up to two years from first&#xD;
      diagnosis. The study closes after 26 months of follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Awaited results For the first time, this prospective study of lung cancers will estimate the&#xD;
      prevalence of these cancers screened in the HIV-infected population. Risks associated with&#xD;
      the incidence of this cancer will be investigated, including potential immune factors. An&#xD;
      increased number of stage I non small cell lung cancers are expected.&#xD;
