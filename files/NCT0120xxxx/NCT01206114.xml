    <textblock>
      A cohort of 3000 adults is followed to evaluate the effectiveness of the monovalent 2009 H1N1&#xD;
      vaccines used 2009-2010 and seasonal influenza vaccines used 2010-2011 in preventing the&#xD;
      first laboratory-confirmed 2009 H1N1 influenza during the influenza season 2010-11.&#xD;

      In the beginning of the study, changes in the background information collected in the&#xD;
      original study (conducted 2009-2010) are asked with a questionnaire. Information on influenza&#xD;
      vaccinations is collected with vaccination cards and monthly short message service (SMS), and&#xD;
      verified in registers, if needed. If an epidemic caused by the 2009 H1N1 virus starts in&#xD;
      Finland, the participants are asked to actively report symptoms of influenza like illnesses&#xD;
      (ILI). The symptoms are also monitored by weekly SMS. In case of ILI, nasal and oral swabs&#xD;
      are collected to verify the 2009 H1N1 influenza cases. Paired serum samples are collected at&#xD;
      the acute on convalescence phase of the disease. The occurrence of laboratory-confirmed 2009&#xD;
      H1N1 influenza cases is compared between vaccinated and not (yet) vaccinated persons.&#xD;
