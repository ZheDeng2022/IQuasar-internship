  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research study is to learn if metformin can affect endometrial cancer cells&#xD;
      in women who do not have diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To determine the molecular effects of metformin and associated physiologic changes in&#xD;
      insulin/glucose metabolism on the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) signaling pathway in&#xD;
      the endometrium of women with endometrial cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To describe the effects of metformin on the histology and proliferation of the&#xD;
           endometrium in women with endometrial cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the effect of body mass index on the response to treatment with metformin&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess the effect of insulin resistance on the response to treatment with metformin&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To determine effects of metformin on the serum, urine and DNA biomarkers of women with&#xD;
           endometrial cancer.&#xD;

      The Study Drug:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metformin is designed to treat both diabetes and insulin resistance. Both diabetes and&#xD;
      insulin resistance have been linked to endometrial cancer. Although you do not have a&#xD;
      diagnosis of diabetes, metformin may still have an affect on your cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visit (before taking Metformin):&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found eligible to take part in this study, you will have a study visit before you&#xD;
      begin taking Metformin. The following tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) and urine will be collected for research to look at&#xD;
           different hormone levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If needed, a fasting glucose level will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are found not to be eligible your blood, urine, and tissue for research will be&#xD;
           discarded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will take metformin, by mouth, 1 time each morning, with breakfast, for at least 7 days&#xD;
      and up to 30 days until your scheduled surgery is performed. You will record the dates and&#xD;
      times you take metformin on a study drug calendar provided by the study staff. You will not&#xD;
      take metformin on the day of your surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Tests (on the day of your surgery):&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will bring your study drug calendar to the clinic on the day of your surgery. The&#xD;
      following tests and procedures will also be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests and to check&#xD;
           different hormone levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During surgery, you will have a second endometrial biopsy for biomarker testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be off study after your surgical procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 30 women will take part in this study. Up to 25 participants will take part at MD&#xD;
      Anderson.&#xD;

After treatment with metformin, expression again observed, and the percent of patients who have an increase in expression will be calculated.</description>
