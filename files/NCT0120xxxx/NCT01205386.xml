      The purpose of this study is to determine if the CROSSER CTO Recanalization System can&#xD;
      facilitate the successful crossing of Chronic Total Occlusions in the Central lumen of the&#xD;
      Superficial Femoral Artery (SFA). A Chronic Total Occlusion (CTO) is defined as 100%&#xD;
      narrowing of the artery, with no angiographically detectable antegrade blood flow, and the&#xD;
      assessment that the lesion has been in existence for a minimum of 30 days. This study will&#xD;
      enroll up to 100 patients at up to 8 clinical sites. The CROSSER CTO Recanalization System&#xD;
      was cleared for commercialization by the US Food &amp; Drug Administration. This study also&#xD;
      involves an imaging device called the IVUS (Intravascular Ultrasound Imaging) catheter. This&#xD;
      device has been cleared for commercialization by the US Food and Drug Administration and will&#xD;
      be studied for its cleared intended use. The IVUS catheter is used to generate real-time&#xD;
      images of the artery, which will allow for evaluation of the artery after the occlusion is&#xD;
      crossed. This is a post-market registry.&#xD;

             undergo an endovascular recanalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Occluded artery must be the native superficial femoral artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must have a totally occlusive lesion classified angiographically as absolute&#xD;
             (100% occlusion with no flow).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient's target vessel occlusion length is ≤ 30 cm.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient's reference vessel diameter is greater than or equal to 3.0mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must be an acceptable candidate for PTA, peripheral artery bypass surgery or&#xD;
             peripheral artery stent implantation.&#xD;
