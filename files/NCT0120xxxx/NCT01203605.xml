      The European Surgical Outcomes Study (EuSOS) is a multi-centre, international cohort study of&#xD;
      peri-operative care and clinical outcomes for patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participating centres throughout Europe will contribute routine clinical data describing all&#xD;
      eligible patients who undergo surgery from 4th April 2011 to 11th April 2011. Patients will&#xD;
      then be followed until hospital discharge (or for a maximum of 60 days) for duration of&#xD;
      hospital stay and hospital mortality. Routine clinical data will also be collected for those&#xD;
      patients admitted to critical care at any stage after surgery but during the same hospital&#xD;
      admission. Specific objectives are to describe clinical outcomes and standards of&#xD;
      peri-operative care for patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery in Europe.&#xD;

      Research questions&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. What is the in-hospital mortality rate for patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery in&#xD;
           Europe?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. What is the duration of hospital stay for patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery in&#xD;
           Europe?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. What is the current standard of peri-operative critical care provision for patients&#xD;
           undergoing non-cardiac surgery in Europe?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. What is the current standard of haemodynamic (cardiac output) monitoring for patients&#xD;
           undergoing non-cardiac surgery in Europe?&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Is there any evidence of differences in the standard of peri-operative care provision&#xD;
           for patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery in different health-care systems within&#xD;
           Europe?&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Is there any evidence of differences in hospital stay and mortality for patients&#xD;
           undergoing major non-cardiac surgery in different health-care systems within Europe?&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. What factors determine planned and unplanned admission to critical care after surgery?&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Are the factors associated with critical care admission similar to those associated with&#xD;
           post-operative death?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      International cohort study of all adult patients undergoing in-patient non-cardiac surgery&#xD;
      from 4th April 2011 to 11th April 2011.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Centres&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to recruit as many European centres as possible but anticipate that a&#xD;
      minimum of 150 hundred centres in ten or more nations will be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics approval&#xD;
&#xD;
      National co-ordinators will be responsible for clarifying the need for ethics approval and&#xD;
      applying for this where appropriate. Centres will not be permitted to record data unless&#xD;
      ethics approval or an equivalent waiver is in place. This study is in effect a large scale&#xD;
      clinical audit. The investigators expect that in most, if not every participating country,&#xD;
      there will be no requirement for individual patient consent as all data will be anonymised&#xD;
      and is already recorded as part of routine clinical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected describing all eligible patients undergoing surgery within the seven&#xD;
      day cohort period. These patients will then be followed up until hospital discharge. Data&#xD;
      will then be fully anonymised and transcribed by local investigators onto an internet based&#xD;
      electronic CRF. A centre specific form will be completed once for each hospital to provide&#xD;
      data including university/non-university hospital, number of operating rooms, number and&#xD;
      level of critical care beds, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data set&#xD;
&#xD;
      An operating room data sheet will be completed once for each patient recruited to include&#xD;
      data describing patient factors (age, gender, American Society of Anesthesiologists grade,&#xD;
      major co-morbid disease, etc), surgical factors (procedure category, grade and urgency of&#xD;
      surgery, grade of surgeon, surgical checklist, etc), anaesthetic factors (anaesthetic&#xD;
      technique, haemodynamic monitoring, airway, grade of anaesthetist, etc), post-operative care&#xD;
      (post-operative recovery ward stay, post-operative invasive or non-invasive ventilation or&#xD;
      inotrope within first 24 hours). A critical care data sheet will be completed once for each&#xD;
      patient admitted to critical care at any time after surgery, to include data describing&#xD;
      whether admission was planned or unplanned, organ support, SAPS III score and SOFA score&#xD;
      etc). Patients will be followed until death or hospital discharge for the following outcomes:&#xD;
      duration of critical care stay, critical care mortality, duration of hospital stay and&#xD;
      in-hospital mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators anticipate that approximately 20,000 patients will be required to provide a&#xD;
      sample of up to 2,000 admissions to critical care after surgery. Assuming an overall&#xD;
      mortality rate following surgery of 1%, a sample size of 20,000 patients will yield 200&#xD;
      deaths. This will allow the inclusion of at least fifteen variables in a logistic regression&#xD;
      model for mortality. The rate of admission to critical care is likely to vary between nations&#xD;
      but an overall rate of 10% will yield data describing up to 2000 admissions to critical care,&#xD;
      whilst an overall rate of 5% will yield 1000 admissions. This to allow construction of a&#xD;
      robust logistic regression model for this outcome. 20,000 patients will also provide &gt;99%&#xD;
      confidence for the overall mortality rate with 0.37% confidence width. If 200 deaths are&#xD;
      observed in an overall sample of 20,000 patients, the 99% confidence interval for the&#xD;
      proportion would be (0.008 - 0.012) with a confidence width of 0.37%. This dataset would also&#xD;
      have sufficient generalisability to inform the practice of peri-operative care on an&#xD;
      international basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data to be collected are all collected as part of routine clinical care. Categorical&#xD;
      variables will be described as proportions and will be compared using chi-square or Fisher's&#xD;
      exact test. Continuous variable will be described as mean and standard deviation if normally&#xD;
      distributed or median and inter-quartile range if not normally distributed. Comparisons of&#xD;
      continuous variables will be performed using one-way ANOVA or Mann-Whitney test as&#xD;
      appropriate. Univariate analysis will be performed to test factors associated with planned&#xD;
      and unplanned admission to critical care and / or in-hospital death. A multiple logistic&#xD;
      regression model will be used to identify independent risk factors. A stepwise approach will&#xD;
      be used to enter new terms into the logistic regression model where p&lt;0.05 was set as the&#xD;
      limit for inclusion of new terms. A logistic regression model will be performed to assess&#xD;
      independent association between prognostic factors and outcomes. Results of logistic&#xD;
      regression will be reported as adjusted odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals. A&#xD;
      single final analysis is planned at the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Organisation&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted by the EuSOS study group on behalf of the European Society of&#xD;
      Intensive Care Medicine and the European Society of Anaesthesiology. National co-ordinators&#xD;
      will lead the project within individual nations and identify participating hospitals,&#xD;
      translate study paperwork, distribute study paperwork and ensure necessary regulatory&#xD;
      approvals are in place. Local co-ordinators will lead in the EuSOS study in individual&#xD;
      institutions ensuring all relevant regulatory approvals are in place and adequate training of&#xD;
      staff. They will supervise data collection, ensure timely data return and act as guarantor&#xD;
      for the integrity and quality of data collected.&#xD;
