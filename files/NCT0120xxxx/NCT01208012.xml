      The trial is a phase IV clinical trial investigating the impact of Liraglutide on endothelial&#xD;
      function and microvascular blood flow in 44 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus aged 30-65&#xD;
      and HbA1c ranging from ≥ 5.5% ≤ 7.0%. The patients will be randomized into two study arms,&#xD;
      one arm will be treated with Metformin monotherapy, the second arm will be treated with&#xD;
      Metformin and Liraglutide at an increasing dose (0.6 mg/day to 1.8 mg/day.)&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is associated with increased cardiovascular risk and the&#xD;
      majority of type 2 diabetic patients die due to the vascular complications of Diabetes&#xD;
      Mellitus. In type 2 diabetic patients, an early marker in the biogenesis of atherosclerosis&#xD;
      and cardiovascular disease is the occurrence of endothelial dysfunction with subsequent&#xD;
      deterioration in micro- and macrovascular blood flow and tissue supply. Also several&#xD;
      mechanistic pathways linking Diabetes Mellitus with endothelial dysfunction and&#xD;
      cardiovascular complications are postulated. Recent studies aimed to investigate the&#xD;
      vasoprotective effect of strict glycaemic control using conventional treatment algorithms&#xD;
      failed to reduce cardiovascular risk in patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 2. Numerous&#xD;
      pharmacological drugs are available to reduce blood glucose levels in type 2 diabetic&#xD;
      patients. Beside comparable glucose lowering efficacy, some of them evolve limited or even&#xD;
      adverse effects on vascular function and cardiovascular risk. Therefore, ideally new&#xD;
      treatments in Diabetes Mellitus type 2 provide more than just reducing blood glucose values.&#xD;
      Future treatments in type 2 Diabetes Mellitus will be judged on their potency to affect the&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk profile in patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liraglutide is a Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue shown to be effective in the&#xD;
      treatment of type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. Liraglutide was shown to improve blood glucose levels&#xD;
      not only by stimulating insulin secretion from the β cell, but also by improving the&#xD;
      conversion of intact proinsulin into insulin and C-peptide in the granula of the β cell.&#xD;
      While in rodents, GLP-1 and its analogues showed an increase in β cell regeneration and an&#xD;
      inhibitory effect on β cell apoptosis, the effect of GLP-1 analogues on β cell mass in humans&#xD;
      is less clear. Beyond its effects on β cells, Liraglutide and other GLP1 analogues were shown&#xD;
      to suppress the glucagon release from α cells and to evolve a supportive effect on weight&#xD;
      reduction by central and probably peripheral effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beside these effects of GLP-1-analogues on β cell physiology and glucose metabolism, recent&#xD;
      studies suggested several pleiotrophic effects of GLP-1 treatment which go beyond glycaemic&#xD;
      control. Receptors for GLP-1 have been located in myocardial and endothelial cells, and GLP-1&#xD;
      supplementation was found to improve myocardial and endothelial function in diabetic and in&#xD;
      non-diabetic subjects. In endothelial cells, isolated from human coronary arteries, GLP-1&#xD;
      rapidly activates endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and stimulates nitric oxide (NO)&#xD;
      production, promotes cell proliferation and inhibits glucolipoapoptosis. In addition, in&#xD;
      transformed vascular endothelial cells, GLP-1 protects endothelial dysfunction incurred by&#xD;
      tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) through the modulation of the expression of vascular adhesion&#xD;
      molecules and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). Chronic administration of GLP-1&#xD;
      analogues is associated with a significant reduction in blood pressure. Therefore it seems&#xD;
      conceivable, that in patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 2, treatment with the GLP-1 analog&#xD;
      Liraglutide might improve the cardiovascular risk profile beyond glucose control by&#xD;
      stimulating endothelial NO release and by improving endothelial function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of our study is to investigate the vascular and endothelial effects of adding&#xD;
      Liraglutide treatment to type 2 diabetic patients previously treated with Metformin.&#xD;
