      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The Center for Human Immunology, Autoimmunity, and Inflammatory Diseases (CHI) is&#xD;
      conducting a variety of laboratory research experiments that require blood, bone marrow,&#xD;
      urine, stool, and/or tissue samples from patients with a diagnosis of an immunologic,&#xD;
      autoimmune, or inflammatory disorder, as well as from their healthy relatives. Donated&#xD;
      samples will be sent to the CHI laboratory at the National Institutes of Health to be used in&#xD;
      research that may provide more information on the changes in the immune system caused by&#xD;
      these specific disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To collect blood, leukapheresis cells, bone marrow, urine, stool, cheek swab, and tissue&#xD;
      samples from patients with immune-mediated and inflammatory diseases, as well as from family&#xD;
      members, for ongoing exploratory research studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals at least 2 years of age who have been diagnosed with an immune-mediated or&#xD;
           inflammatory disease, or have signs or symptoms of an immune or inflammatory disease&#xD;
           without a formal diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Immediate family members (parent, child, sibling, grandchild) of the above mentioned&#xD;
           individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a complete medical history, physical examination, and&#xD;
           blood and urine samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will provide blood, urine, stool, cheek swab, and tissue samples as&#xD;
           required by the study researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants who have immune or inflammatory diseases will also provide blood and bone&#xD;
           marrow samples collected through biopsies and leukapheresis (to collect specific blood&#xD;
           cells).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adult relatives will provide additional samples through more invasive procedures such as&#xD;
           leukapheresis and bone marrow biopsies. Child relatives (between 2 and 18 years of age)&#xD;
           will not undergo these invasive procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No treatment will be provided as part of this protocol.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical investigators in the Center for Human Immunology, Autoimmunity, and Inflammatory&#xD;
      Diseases (CHI) study the pathophysiology of a wide variety of immune-mediated and&#xD;
      inflammatory diseases. One of the goals of the CHI is to better understand these diseases and&#xD;
      to refine therapeutic approaches used in their management based on knowledge of the&#xD;
      underlying pathophysiologies. This requires samples from patients with immune-mediated and&#xD;
      inflammatory diseases for such clinical and laboratory assessments. Collection of samples&#xD;
      from family members is necessary to identify genetic components of specific conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We expect the great majority of publications from the Center for Human Immunology,&#xD;
      Autoimmunity, and Inflammatory Diseases (CHI) over the next several decades will be generated&#xD;
      from exploratory laboratory research studies done using blood and bone marrow and other&#xD;
      tissue samples from such patients and their family members. These publications are expected&#xD;
      to number in the hundreds. Ongoing and future research projects depend on the ready&#xD;
      availability of samples of blood, tissue, leukapheresed cells, and bone marrow from patients&#xD;
      for in vitro studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE&#xD;
&#xD;
      To provide a mechanism for collection of blood, bone marrow, leukapheresis cells, urine,&#xD;
      stool, buccal mucosa and/or tissue samples from patients with immune-mediated and&#xD;
      inflammatory diseases, as well as from family members for ongoing exploratory research&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is not a treatment protocol. This is a sample and clinical data procurement&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects with conditions of interest seen at the NIH Clinical Center will first be&#xD;
      enrolled onto CHI protocol 09-H-0201 Screening protocol for subjects being evaluated for&#xD;
      Center for Human Immunology, Autoimmunity, and Inflammatory Diseases (CHI) protocols.&#xD;
      Patients who require specific medical intervention will be enrolled on and receive treatment&#xD;
      under another NIH or CHI Clinical Center protocol or will be under the care of their home&#xD;
      health care provider. In exceptional cases in which it is not possible for patients to travel&#xD;
      to the Clinical Center, they may be allowed the option of giving consent to provide samples&#xD;
      for research studies, including genetic analyses, performed on blood, buccal mucosa, bone&#xD;
      marrow, and tissue samples sent through their local physician without enrolling onto&#xD;
      09-H-0201. Information will be obtained retrospectively by review of medical records and&#xD;
      examination of archived materials and/or prospectively by clinical examinations and&#xD;
      laboratory tests. The protocol is written for an indefinite period of time with subject&#xD;
      accrual to occur both at the NIH Clinical Center or through home health care providers (off&#xD;
      site).&#xD;
