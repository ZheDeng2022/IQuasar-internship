  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Paclitaxel and bevacizumab showed improved PFS compared to paclitaxel alone. Recent&#xD;
           results of the AVADO study report a similar result for the combination of docetaxel and&#xD;
           bevacizumab. The AVADO study furthermore confirmed the dose of 15 mg/kg BW of&#xD;
           bevacizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  As in metastatic breast cancer (MBC) poly-chemotherapies are frequently used, regimens&#xD;
           with bevacizumab and at least 2 cytotoxic agents should be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Docetaxel and capecitabine showed a benefit in PFS and survival. This combi- nation is&#xD;
           therefore a reasonable choice.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose of capecitabine and docetaxel should be reduced to 1800 mg/m2 and 75 mg/m2 to&#xD;
           improve tolerability without compromising efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Paclitaxel and capecitabine is well tolerated and showed a PFS of 10.3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Docetaxel 100 mg/m2 as monotherapy in MBC not very often used b/o toxicity. 75 mg/m2&#xD;
           much more accepted in daily practice. Better comparability with DBX, if both arms have&#xD;
           75mg/m2 docetaxel as assumed.&#xD;

      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To determine the Progression Free Survival (PFS) in patients with metastatic breast cancer&#xD;
      after treatment with taxane plus bevacizumab with (TXB) or without capecitabine (TB).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the objective response rate in both arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the duration of response in both arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the Time to Progression (TTP) in both arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the clinical benefit defined as CR, PR, or stable disease ≥ 24 weeks in&#xD;
           both arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the overall survival rate 3 years after &quot;Last Patient In&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine PFS and TTP response rates in patient's ≥ age 65.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the toxicity and compliance in both arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the predictive value of serum markers such as VEGF.&#xD;
