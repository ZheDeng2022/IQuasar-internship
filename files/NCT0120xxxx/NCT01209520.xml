    <textblock>
      The trial investigates the feasibility and efficacy of targeting Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer&#xD;
      (NSCLC) &quot;driven&quot; by epigenetic changes. The investigators study the impact of 5-azacitidine&#xD;
      (Vidaza®, Celgene, Summit, NJ, USA) in combination with conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy&#xD;
      in a sequential fashion. The study population consists of all NSCLC patients who undergo&#xD;
      &quot;curative&quot; lung cancer resection and whose tumors harbor hypermethylation in any of the&#xD;
      protocol-specific genes (samples will be banked for additional molecular testing including&#xD;
      other 21 loci which have shown to be important in lung carcinogenesis.&#xD;

      Adjuvant chemotherapy has become an essential part for the treatment of stage IB-IIIA NSCLC&#xD;
      patients based on 4 randomized clinical trials showing survival advantage for patients who&#xD;
      received adjuvant CT, oncologists initially started to adapt this modality of treatment for&#xD;
      pathologically stage IB-IIIA NSCLC patients [4]. Herein, NSCLC patients will be treated in&#xD;
      the adjuvant setting with conventional doublet platinum-based chemotherapy followed by&#xD;
      5-azacitidine, a demethylating agent. The planned dosages to be used in this trial have been&#xD;
      extensively studied in previously conducted clinical trials involving all therapeutic agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will undergo thorough surgical resection of the primary lung tumor, and evidence&#xD;
      of promoter hypermethylation of gene(s) must be present in the tumor specimen and/or blood&#xD;
      sample (plasma or WBC). The collection of tumor specimen will be considered a priority to&#xD;
      correlate the tumor &quot;methylation pattern/profile&quot; with the serum &quot;methylation&#xD;
      pattern/profile&quot;. If tumor specimen is not available for any reason, but the patient has at&#xD;
      least one of the 9 targeted genes hypermethylated in the serum, the patient is eligible to be&#xD;
      enrolled into the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will consist of 2 parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A. Adjuvant chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following surgical resection of NSCLC and test positive for promoter hypermethylation in at&#xD;
      least one (1) of the targeted TSGs described, patient will start adjuvant conventional&#xD;
      chemotherapy (doublet platinum-based chemotherapy) for stage IB-IIIA NSCLC. In the case a&#xD;
      patient with stage IB refuses adjuvant chemotherapy, the patient still can be enrolled into&#xD;
      Part B of the study if he/she understands the concept of the trial and sign an informed&#xD;
      consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional chemotherapy will be selected at discretion of the treating physicians except on&#xD;
      those cases in which pathologic diagnosis indicates non squamous NSCLC. Those patients will&#xD;
      be treated with pemetrexed. Patients will receive a total of 4 cycles of adjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy (each cycle given every 21 days). Pegfilgrastim, a granulocyte-colony&#xD;
      stimulating factor (G-CSF), will be allowed on day 2 at discretion of the clinician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients should be premedicated prior to paclitaxel or docetaxel administration in order&#xD;
      to prevent severe hypersensitivity reactions (HSR). Such premedication may consist of:&#xD;
      dexamethasone 20 mg orally administered approximately 12 and 6 hours before paclitaxel or&#xD;
      docetaxel; diphenhydramine 50 mg intravenously and cimetidine (300 mg) or ranitidine (50 mg)&#xD;
      intravenously 30 minutes before paclitaxel. In case of pemetrexed, patient will received an&#xD;
      injection of vitamin B-12 1,000 mcg IM a week prior to start therapy as well as folic acid 1&#xD;
      mg po daily a week before pemetrexed infusion and during the entire course of treatment with&#xD;
      this antifolate agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dosages and toxicities of these chemotherapy agents are very well described in the&#xD;
      clinical setting, and patients will be managed as any other patient receiving standard&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B. Targeted therapy using 5-azacitidine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient decides not to receive adjuvant chemotherapy, the patient still can be&#xD;
      enrolled into the study, if the patient understands the concept of chemoprevention and&#xD;
      consents to blood sampling during 5-azacitidine administration and follow-up (informed&#xD;
      consent signed). This part of the study consists of 6 cycles of 5-azacitidine (Vidaza®,&#xD;
      Celgene, Summit, NJ, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four weeks after completion of adjuvant chemotherapy (day 28 from day 1 of last cycle of&#xD;
      chemotherapy), the patient will continue his/her treatment plan with 6 cycles of&#xD;
      5-azacitidine. To be eligible for this part of the study, patient must have no evidence of&#xD;
      disease (NED). Thus, patient will be assessed by CT scan chest/abdomen/pelvis with and&#xD;
      without intravenous contrast prior to initiating Part B. In case of iodine&#xD;
      allergy/anaphylaxis history, patient will be assessed with MRI. Progression of disease will&#xD;
      be defined by RECIST criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient will receive 5-azacitidine at a dose of 75 mg/m2 intravenously daily on day 1-5 every&#xD;
      28 days for 6 cycles. Biological correlatives will be performed during this period. Toxicity&#xD;
      management is described in section 6.0. The use of growth factor support (either&#xD;
      erythropoietin stimulating agents or G-CSF) will be also allowed at discretion of the&#xD;
      treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anatomical Studies:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will have surgical resection of the primary tumor. Pieces of the resected tumor&#xD;
      and non-tumor lung tissues that are not required for pathological evaluation will be frozen&#xD;
      in optimum temperature compound (OTC) and saved for molecular analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of the enrollment process, patient will be assessed through CT scan of the&#xD;
      chest/abdomen/pelvis with and without intravenous contrast or with MRI in case of&#xD;
      contraindication for iodine contrast, prior to initiate Part B of the treatment (confirming&#xD;
      clinically and radiological &quot;no evidence of disease-NED&quot;). Another assessment will be&#xD;
      performed 4 weeks after the last dose of 5-azacitidine (to confirm NED status). Patient will&#xD;
      be clinically followed up every 3 months until completion of 2 years post-treatment. Imaging&#xD;
      tests will be performed every 3 months with CT scan as part of the standard follow-up until&#xD;
      completion of 2 years post-surgery. After 2 years of post-treatment completion, patient will&#xD;
      be followed up every 6 months in the clinic and also by radiographic studies until completion&#xD;
      of 5 years post-treatment. In the case of clinical suspicion for progression, patient will&#xD;
      undergo a thorough and complete work-up to rule out this possibility. This may include&#xD;
      imaging diagnostic tests, biopsy, or other tests and procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biological Correlatives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The premise of the study is that certain loci will be hypermethylated in the lung cancer&#xD;
      specimen of the patients. For some loci (which we shall call Type I) the tumor will show&#xD;
      significantly elevated methylation compared to adjacent histologically normal tissue, thus&#xD;
      providing a cancer-specific methylation signal. Other loci (which we will refer to as Type&#xD;
      II) may be methylated in the tumor as well as in the adjacent &quot;histologically&quot; normal tissue&#xD;
      and/or WBCs. These loci will not be cancer-specific markers, though they may indicate&#xD;
      precancerous changes or they may be indicative of &quot;cancer risk&quot;. Their hypermethylation may&#xD;
      be age-associated or environmentally induced, yielding &quot;field effects&quot; or &quot;field defects&quot;.&#xD;
      Field defects would consist of molecular alterations (in this case hypermethylation) that are&#xD;
      not yet visible as histological changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Independent of whether a hypermethylated locus is specific for overt cancer (Type I) or not&#xD;
      (Type II), it would be of interest for the study. These Type II changes would be &quot;hypothesis&#xD;
      generating&quot;. Since it has been well documented in the literature that DNA from cells can be&#xD;
      shed into the blood stream (more so in the case of cancer patients), it would be expected&#xD;
      that at least for some of the loci that are hypermethylated (Type I and II), this methylation&#xD;
      would be detectable in the plasma. Tumor tissue methylation will be correlated with serum&#xD;
      obtained at the time of tumor resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It might be expected that complete resection would lead to a reduction or complete&#xD;
      disappearance in the methylation signal for Type I loci in the plasma, since the source of&#xD;
      the signal has been removed. Type II also shows methylation in the tissue adjacent to the&#xD;
      tumor, these loci might continue to provide signal in the plasma (though it may be somewhat&#xD;
      diminished).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type I loci would therefore be of great use to verify complete resection and to monitor&#xD;
      recurrence (one would anticipate the signal to increase again as the cancer grows back),&#xD;
      while Type II loci would be a great tool to monitor the efficacy of demethylating drugs. It&#xD;
      must be acknowledged that the spectrum of Type I and Type II methylation may not be sharply&#xD;
      delineated.&#xD;
