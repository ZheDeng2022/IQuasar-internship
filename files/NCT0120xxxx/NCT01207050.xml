      This pilot study proposes to examine the effect of Rozerem on sleep/wake patterns among&#xD;
      individuals with Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) experiencing sleep disturbance, using both&#xD;
      objective and subjective measures. It will also show that improvement in sleep/wake patterns&#xD;
      resulting from Rozerem will impact daytime functioning using objective and subjective&#xD;
      measures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although research has begun to examine sleep quality within the traumatic brain injury (TBI)&#xD;
      population, most of the studies found in the research literature utilize subjective,&#xD;
      self-report measures that can be problematic in terms of response accuracy when used with&#xD;
      populations that have known cognitive deficits (Ba√±os, LaGory, Sawrie, Faught, Knowlton,&#xD;
      Prasad, Kuzniecky and Martin, 2004). Because TBI often results in a diminished capacity for&#xD;
      self-reflective awareness, obtaining reliable sleep-related information is difficult to do&#xD;
      through surveys alone (Fleming, Strong, Ashton, 1996; Vanderploeg, Belanger, Duchnick, and&#xD;
      Curtiss, 2007).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of studies have attempted to objectify the measurement of sleep quality in TBI&#xD;
      rehabilitation by having nursing staff keep an overnight log to document whether the patient&#xD;
      was asleep or awake at hourly intervals (Burke, Shah, Schneider, Ahangar, &amp; Al Aladai, 2004;&#xD;
      Worthington &amp; Melia, 2006). Because this results in only one single observation point per&#xD;
      hour, it misses the nuances of the sleep/wake cycle obtained through more continuous&#xD;
      measurement throughout the night and is still somewhat subjective and dependent on the&#xD;
      observer's judgment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Polysomnography, the electrophysiological measurement of sleep, is widely used in the&#xD;
      clinical setting to diagnose sleep disorders. Using this more objective measure, Masel and&#xD;
      colleagues (2001) found a high prevalence of posttraumatic hypersomnia, sleep apnea-hypopnea&#xD;
      syndrome and periodic limb movement disorder that was not identified through self-report&#xD;
      measures (Masel, Scheibel, Kimbark, &amp; Kuna, 2001). This illustrates the limitations of&#xD;
      self-report questionnaires and highlights the need for more objective measures. However, the&#xD;
      high cost and inconvenience of polysomnography, requiring multiple electrodes attached to the&#xD;
      face, head, and other parts of the body, make it less practical for research studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These limitations of subjective self-report measures and the cost and inconvenience of&#xD;
      polysomnography suggest the need for alternative methods of measurement. With the use of an&#xD;
      actigraph, a small, highly sensitive, accelerometer (motion detector) worn on the wrist over&#xD;
      a period of days, a number of sleep-related variables can be derived through the analysis of&#xD;
      motion and rest patterns using a computer algorithm (Coffield &amp; Tryon, 2004). Variables such&#xD;
      as sleep latency, total time asleep, and number of nocturnal awakenings derived through&#xD;
      actigraphy are comparable to those obtained via polysomnography, and recent research studies&#xD;
      demonstrate the validity of actigraph-based sleep/wake estimates among individuals with&#xD;
      acquired brain injury (Muller, Czymmek, Thone-Otto, &amp; Von Cramon, 2006; Tweedy &amp; Trost, 2005;&#xD;
      Schuiling, Rinkel, Walchenbach, &amp; de Weerd, 2005). Thus, actigraphy represents a means of&#xD;
      measurement that will enable the collection of objective data in the comfort of the sleeper's&#xD;
      usual environment in a manner that is less invasive and more cost-effective than&#xD;
      polysomnography, and more reliable than self-report measures alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most widely researched treatments for sleep disturbance are problematic for individuals&#xD;
      with TBI due to their effects on cognition and risk for dependence. With a high prevalence of&#xD;
      sleep/wake disorders found among individuals with TBI, Rozerem is a promising treatment&#xD;
      option to improve sleep quality that is less likely to exacerbate cognitive sequelae of TBI&#xD;
      and less likely to result in dependence.&#xD;
