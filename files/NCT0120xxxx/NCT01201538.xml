  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acoustic Neuromas (otherwise known as Vestibular Schwannoma -VS) are benign tumors which grow&#xD;
      on the hearing nerve and can cause progressive hearing loss and compression of vital brain&#xD;
      structures and even death if it continues. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate&#xD;
      the efficacy of Nilotinib in the treatment of patients with progressing VS. Secondary&#xD;
      objectives of this study is to evaluate the toxicity profile, quality of life and symptom&#xD;
      management of Nilotinib in the treatment of patients with progressing VS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      UHN laboratory has demonstrated that targets of Imatinib (c-Kit and PDGFR-α and PDGFR-ß) are&#xD;
      overexpressed and activated in both sporadic and NF2 VS.It has also been shown pre-clinically&#xD;
      that Imatinib induced a reduction in proliferation and cell viability, with increased&#xD;
      apoptosis, in HEI-193 human NF2-null VS cells.Nilotinib is a newer generation RTK inhibitor,&#xD;
      with a similar target profile as Imatinib. It was designed by modifying the Imatinib&#xD;
      molecule62, and has 30-fold increased potency compared to IImatinib43. In clinical studies of&#xD;
      patients with CML or GIST resistant to Imatinib, Nilotinib has demonstrated efficacy with&#xD;
      minimal toxicity. Nilotinib (Tasigna®, code number AMN107) was first approved in 2007 for use&#xD;
      in Philadelphia chromosome positive CML in the chronic or accelerated phase in patients&#xD;
      resistant or intolerant to prior therapy. Thus making Nilotinib an ideal drug to study in&#xD;
      understanding its benefit in VS patients.&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Growing VS defined as an increase in MRI volumetric growth (minimal 15%) on two&#xD;
             successive scans within 18 months prior to registration&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients may be either treatment naïve or have recurrent VS after previous surgery/&#xD;
             stereotactic radiosurgery&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Essentially neurologically asymptomatic (with the exception of sensorineural hearing&#xD;
             loss, mild tinnitus and facial numbness) as assessed by the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Karnofsky performance score &gt;70&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Adequate renal, haematological, liver function within 7 days prior to registration&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits, drug administration plan,&#xD;
             laboratory tests, other study procedures, and study restrictions&#xD;

          8. Willingness and ability to provide informed consent&#xD;
