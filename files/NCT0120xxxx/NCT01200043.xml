    <textblock>
      The sugar fructose has been implicated not just as a cause of obesity, but as a cause of the&#xD;
      metabolic diseases that go along with obesity, termed &quot;metabolic syndrome&quot;. Obese children&#xD;
      with metabolic disease will be studied before and after 10 days of a fructose restricted&#xD;
      diet. The question is whether their co-morbidities will improve, even if weight remains&#xD;
      constant.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies suggest that specific types of macronutrients in the diet may have selective&#xD;
      effects on nutrient absorption, insulin sensitivity, and lipid metabolism. Elucidation of the&#xD;
      metabolic impact of specific dietary components may well result in improved efficacy of&#xD;
      lifestyle approaches to reduce obesity and metabolic diseases. Despite similar fructose&#xD;
      consumption, the phenotype of co-morbidities is different between African Americans and&#xD;
      Latinos. Latino and Caucasian children manifest worsened dyslipidemia and non-alcoholic fatty&#xD;
      liver disease (NAFLD), while African American children manifest worsened insulin resistance&#xD;
      and hypertension. We have also documented in adults that a reduction in de novo lipogenesis&#xD;
      (DNL; production of new lipids) in the liver and liver fat content, and improvement in&#xD;
      hepatic insulin sensitivity were achieved by substitution of complex carbohydrate for&#xD;
      fructose; but these changes appeared less dramatic in African American compared to Latino or&#xD;
      Caucasian subjects. These divergent findings suggest ethnic and race-specific differences of&#xD;
      fructose metabolism and disposition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine whether fructose is a contributor to metabolic co-morbidity in children, we will&#xD;
      conduct a convenience cohort within-subject intervention with repeated measures, stratified&#xD;
      by racial/ethnic group (Latinos vs. African Americans vs. Caucasians). The intervention will&#xD;
      consist of restricting fructose ingestion only to naturally-occurring fructose in fruits and&#xD;
      vegetables (approximately 15 gm/day for 10 days), by substituting complex carbohydrate for&#xD;
      excess dietary fructose, while maintaining neutral energy balance. We anticipate fructose&#xD;
      restriction to differentially improve co-morbidities in different racial/ethnic groups.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  African-American, Latino, and Caucasian boys and girls. Ethnicity is to be determined&#xD;
             by self-report. Utilizing the US Census Bureau procedures, participants will be asked&#xD;
             two questions, the first regarding ethnicity and the second on race. Subjects will be&#xD;
             given the opportunity to select more than one racial category.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ages 8 to 18 yr. The minimum age cutoff is due to our desire not to sedate younger&#xD;
             children for the magnetic resonance spectroscopy scan or magnetic resonance scan (MRS,&#xD;
             MRI). We chose to study these groups because they are most affected by metabolic&#xD;
             syndrome and manifest the greatest morbidities; yet their presentations are different&#xD;
             from each other.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The following criteria are modified from the National Cholesterol Education Program's&#xD;
             Adult Treatment Panel and the World Health Organization definition of metabolic&#xD;
             syndrome. Waist circumference is not an adequate predictor of visceral adiposity in&#xD;
             children. Also, no normative values have been developed nor is this measurement&#xD;
             consistent between racial and ethnic groups. Body mass index (BMI), however,&#xD;
             correlates strongly with both visceral lipid depot and blood pressure. The definition&#xD;
             of hypertension is greater than the 95th percentile for sex and age as designated in&#xD;
             the 1996 Task Force Report on High Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Obesity, as defined by BMI z-score of 2.0 or greater, or above the 97th&#xD;
                  percentile for age and sex; and weight ≥40 kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Hyperinsulinemia (fasting insulin &gt;15 µU/mL), or insulin resistant (HOMA &gt; 4.3).&#xD;
                  See details below.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. At least one of the following: systolic blood pressure above the 95th percentile&#xD;
                  for age and sex, or triglyceride level above the 95th percentile for age, sex and&#xD;
                  race or ethnic group as established by the 1998 National Heart, Lung, and Blood&#xD;
                  Institute Growth and Health Study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of disorders other than obesity that may affect insulin levels, such as&#xD;
             Cushing's syndrome, diabetes mellitus, or depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Medications that may affect insulin sensitivity or hepatic lipid content, e.g.&#xD;
             metformin, steroids, atypical antipsychotics, anti depressants, statins, Vitamin E,&#xD;
             thyroid medications, anti-hypertensives, weight loss medications, oral contraceptives.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy or lactation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Surgical procedures for obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History consistent with obstructive sleep apnea.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Implants including intracranial surgical clips, pacemakers, and other metals or&#xD;
             implants that preclude MR scanning.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Claustrophobia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to fit within the MR bore: shoulder to shoulder width of greater than 58 cm&#xD;
             or anterior-posterior length greater than 35 cm (magnet bore size limitation).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Weight greater than 320 pounds (MRS table weight limitation).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eating disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Smoking or alcohol use. Subjects will answer the two questions on the Alcohol Query&#xD;
             Form. Any consumption of more than 2 drinks per month will&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Vegan diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All subjects with known diabetes mellitus according to the 1997 ADA criteria will be&#xD;
             excluded. However, subjects with known impaired glucose tolerance (fasting glucose&#xD;
             101-125, and 2-hour post-prandial glucose level between 141-200) can remain eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Syndromic patients (e.g. Prader-Willi, Bardet-Biedl) will be excluded, as it is likely&#xD;
             that the reasons for their obesity may be neurologic or single-point mutations, and&#xD;
             are likely to be different from those causing the Metabolic Syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are found to be hypothyroid by clinical exam or by evaluation of thyroid&#xD;
             function tests on first visit to the WATCH Clinic will receive L-thyroxine for three&#xD;
             months, with documentation of adequate replacement, prior to enrollment in the&#xD;
             protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a history of hepatitis will be excluded from the study. However,&#xD;
             patients with NAFLD, as determined by Dr. P. Rosenthal (Ped. Hepatology, UCSF), may&#xD;
             participate. Upper cutoffs for AST and ALT will be 5 times the upper limit of normal&#xD;
             for the UCSF laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with any history of renal disease will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have a fever or an active infection will be postponed until their&#xD;
             infection remits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Emancipated minors will be excluded, as there will be no parental supervision and&#xD;
             monitoring over the subject's diet during the 9 days of fructose restriction.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females who have achieved menarche will have a urine pregnancy test at the time of&#xD;
             their DEXA scans. A positive pregnancy test will lead to exclusion of the data from&#xD;
             further analysis. Results of a positive pregnancy test will be transmitted to the&#xD;
             minor only, and the parents will be told only that the subject does not qualify for&#xD;
             the study.&#xD;
