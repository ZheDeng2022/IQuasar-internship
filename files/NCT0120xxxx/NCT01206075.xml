  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thalassemia is considered the most common genetic disorder worldwide, occurring with high&#xD;
      frequency in Mediterranean areas, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands.&#xD;
      Currently, the only cure for thalassemia is bone marrow transplantation from a related,&#xD;
      compatible donor. Gene transfer, achieved by transplantation of the patient's own blood stem&#xD;
      cells that have been genetically-modified with the corrected gene, could potentially cure&#xD;
      thalassemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first step in developing gene transfer for treatment of thalassemia is to develop a safe&#xD;
      and effective method to obtain blood stem cells from thalassemia patients. Eventually, high&#xD;
      numbers of genetically modified cells will need to be infused into the patient for clinical&#xD;
      gene transfer to be effective. The blood stem cells are obtained by giving a &quot;mobilization&quot;&#xD;
      agent to the patients. This causes the stem cells to leave the bone marrow and go into the&#xD;
      blood. The purpose of this study is to test the safety and effectiveness of the new&#xD;
      mobilization agent, Mozobil, in causing mobilization of blood stem cells for patients with&#xD;
      beta-thalassemia major.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to optimize blood stem cell mobilization in adults with beta&#xD;
      thalassemia major. We seek a method of mobilization that will be safe, with minimum side&#xD;
      effects, and that will yield high numbers of blood stem cells. For successful gene therapy of&#xD;
      thalassemia, high numbers of genetically modified stem cells will need to be introduced into&#xD;
      the patient. Participants will include beta-thalassemia patients who failed to mobilize&#xD;
      sufficiently with G-CSF (in our previous protocol) and new patients. In this study we will&#xD;
      focus on the safety and effectiveness of mobilization with Mozobil or with Mozobil plus&#xD;
      G-CSF. Following mobilization, blood stem cells will be recovered using leukapheresis, a&#xD;
      procedure similar to a blood donation, in which mobilized white blood cells are collected&#xD;
      from the blood of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During drug administration and leukapheresis, patients will be hospitalized at George&#xD;
      Papanicolaou Hospital in Thessaloniki, Greece. Patients who failed to mobilize in the&#xD;
      previous protocol will receive Mozobil and G-CSF and will be hospitalized for 5-8 days for&#xD;
      the duration of drug administration and leukapheresis. They will receive G-CSF for several&#xD;
      days; Mozobil will be added on the last few days of G-CSF. New patients will receive Mozobil&#xD;
      only and will be hospitalized for 2-3 days for drug administration and leukapheresis. Mozobil&#xD;
      is administered at 240µg/kg, under the skin. Participants will undergo two or three&#xD;
      leukapheresis procedures in a row if low numbers of blood stem cells were recovered in the&#xD;
      first (and possibly second) leukapheresis. Participants will be discharged from the hospital&#xD;
      the day following the last leukapheresis procedure. Weekly follow-up visits will occur for&#xD;
      the next month, either at G. Papanicolaou Hospital, or at the participant's local doctor's&#xD;
      office. The total period of study participation is approximately 5 weeks. In the event that&#xD;
      Mozobil alone does not cause mobilization of high levels of blood cells, patients will be&#xD;
      invited to repeat the protocol three months later, receiving Mozobil and G-CSF.&#xD;
