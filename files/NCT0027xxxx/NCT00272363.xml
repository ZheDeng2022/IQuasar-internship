      This study will document the clinical and genetic features of glaucoma and related diseases,&#xD;
      including normal tension glaucoma (NTG). Researchers would like to define genetic influences&#xD;
      and eventually isolate the genes causing those diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glaucoma is an important cause of vision loss in the United States and worldwide. The disease&#xD;
      is marked by a wearing down of the retina and optic nerve, often associated with increased&#xD;
      pressure in the eye. It is often an inherited trait. This study will involve between 250 and&#xD;
      2,000 patients over a 5-year period. It will examine the natural history of the genotype, or&#xD;
      genetic makeup, of a person and the phenotype, that is, visible situations produced by the&#xD;
      interaction of the genotype and one's environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 4 and older who have glaucoma or related diseases or whose family members have those&#xD;
      diseases may be eligible for this study. They will complete a medical history for the doctors&#xD;
      to verify the diagnosis, inquire about medical problems and surgical operations, and gather&#xD;
      data about vision problems in a patient's family (by drawing a family tree). The complete eye&#xD;
      examination may take several hours. Eye drops will be used to dilate, or enlarge, the pupils&#xD;
      of patients' eyes, and the pupils will stay dilated for 4 to 6 hours. There may be some&#xD;
      temporary glare in brightly lit areas, which can be reduced by wearing of sunglasses.&#xD;
      Patients may experience some blurring of vision. There may be a localized allergic reaction&#xD;
      to the medication used or an increase of pressure inside the eye. If that occurs, medication&#xD;
      to control the reaction will be given. In addition, photographs of the retina and perhaps&#xD;
      even the lens will be taken. For that procedure, eye drops will dilate the pupils of the&#xD;
      eyes. The light that is involved with the specialized photography may cause some mild&#xD;
      discomfort. Patients will undergo eye tests regarding color vision, field of vision, and&#xD;
      ability to see the dark. Also, there will be a measurement of pressure in the eye and&#xD;
      thickness of the cornea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study patients' DNA, the researchers will obtain a blood sample of about 4 teaspoons from&#xD;
      patients 10 years or older. A smaller amount of about 1 teaspoon for each 5 lb. of body&#xD;
      weight will be collected from younger patients. Those DNA samples will be used only for&#xD;
      research in the genetic disorder in a patient's family. No other testing or research will be&#xD;
      conducted on the blood samples without patients' separate permission. Also, the DNA will be&#xD;
      stored by codes that the researchers define and contained in a secured building.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, researchers will not provide information about a patient's health to patient&#xD;
      family members or to other people. They will not discuss information such as adoption or&#xD;
      biological fatherhood unless it has medical implications for the patient or the patient's&#xD;
      family members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If information obtained from this study may be important to patients' health, they will be&#xD;
      informed when it is available. There are no plans to give patients the results of any medical&#xD;
      tests, evaluations, or other research data. Further research may be needed before such&#xD;
      results become meaningful.&#xD;

      Objective: This project, Clinical and Molecular Studies in Families with Glaucoma and Related&#xD;
      Diseases, will study the inheritance of glaucoma in families of many nationalities and ethnic&#xD;
      backgrounds in order to identify the genes that, when mutated, cause glaucoma, elevated&#xD;
      intraocular pressure, or similar diseases and the pathophysiology through which they act.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: The number of subjects to be enrolled has no logical upper limit, but will&#xD;
      be at least 250 and not more than 2000 during the next 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: The study consists of ascertaining individuals and especially families with multiple&#xD;
      individuals, affected by glaucoma or related retinal and anterior chamber diseases. These&#xD;
      patients and their families will undergo detailed ophthalmological examinations and, where&#xD;
      indicated, additional non-investigational examinations to characterize disease in their&#xD;
      families and determine their affectation status. A blood sample will be collected from each&#xD;
      individual for isolation of DNA and in some individuals biochemical testing or for&#xD;
      lymphoblastoid transformation to establish a renewable source of DNA. Linkage analysis,&#xD;
      physical mapping, SNP and microsatellite analysis for association studies, and mutational&#xD;
      screening will be carried out to identify the specific the gene and the mutations in it that&#xD;
      are associated with glaucoma in this family. If necessary, the gene product or blood sample&#xD;
      will be characterized biochemically. The study will enroll subjects at the NEI and at&#xD;
      collaborating institutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures: Linkage will be determined using the lod score method and mutations in&#xD;
      specific genes will be assessed using a combination of residue conservation, blosum score,&#xD;
      and molecular modeling. Biochemical, metabolic, and physiological effects will be&#xD;
      individualized to the specific assay.&#xD;
