      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The primary objective is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of telithromycin versus&#xD;
           placebo as a supplement to the usual standard of care during an acute exacerbation of&#xD;
           asthma. Efficacy will be assessed by:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Changes in the diary card summary symptom score assessed daily for 6 weeks, and&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Changes in the domiciliary morning Peak Expiratory Flow Rate (PEFR) following oral&#xD;
                telithromycin treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the microbial activity of telithromycin during an exacerbation of asthma by:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Assessment of the patient's clinical improvement relative to initial C. pneumoniae&#xD;
                or M. pneumoniae status, and&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Analysis of the quantitative changes from baseline in C. pneumonia or M. pneumoniae&#xD;
                by culture and quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety of 10 days of oral telithromycin as a supplement to the standard&#xD;
           of care for patients with acute exacerbations of asthma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess additional efficacy endpoints and health outcome evaluations following 10 days&#xD;
           of treatment with either oral telithromycin or placebo, with either treatment used as a&#xD;
           supplement to the standard of care for patients with acute exacerbations of asthma:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Changes and daily variability in the PEFR during the 6 weeks of study treatment,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Health status at follow-up (6 weeks)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Pulmonary function tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1)&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Forced Vital Capacity (FVC)&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Forced Expiratory Flow Rate (FEF25-75%)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Need for additional medications (e.g., inhaled corticosteroids, oral&#xD;
                corticosteroids, bronchodilator use),&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Time to next acute exacerbation of asthma.&#xD;
