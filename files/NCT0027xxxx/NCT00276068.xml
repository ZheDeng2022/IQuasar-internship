      The Vulvar Vestibulitis Clinical Trial (VVCT) a randomized, placebo-controlled, double&#xD;
      blinded clinical trial. We will study the clinical efficacy of four medical treatments for&#xD;
      vulvar vestibulitis: topical lidocaine, oral desipramine, combined lidocaine and desipramine,&#xD;
      and placebo cream and capsules. Desipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant commonly used by&#xD;
      clinicians for treatment of several chronic pain conditions that demonstrates an optimal side&#xD;
      effect profile compared to other tricyclic antidepressants. Topical lidocaine has also been&#xD;
      found to be beneficial for vulvar vestibulitis treatment in small studies. It is hypothesized&#xD;
      that the combined use of oral desipramine and topical lidocaine will be more therapeutically&#xD;
      effective than either one by itself and better than placebo.&#xD;

      The Vulvar Vestibulitis Clinical Trial (VVCT) is a randomized, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      double-blinded clinical trial to study the clinical efficacy of four medical treatments for&#xD;
      vulvar vestibulitis: 1) topical lidocaine, 2) oral desipramine, 3) combined lidocaine and&#xD;
      desipramine, and 4) placebo cream and capsules. The duration of study drug will last 12 weeks&#xD;
      with post-intervention follow-up at 6 and 12 months. We plan to enroll 128 subjects from the&#xD;
      university-based clinical program at the University of Rochester (UR).Primary outcome&#xD;
      variable will compare the reported pain of the &quot;Tampon Test&quot; (mean of Weeks -2, -1, and 0),&#xD;
      prior to randomization to the reported pain of &quot;Tampon Test&quot; (mean of Weeks 10, 11, and 12).&#xD;
      The dependent (primary outcome) variable will be defined as the percent change of mean&#xD;
      &quot;Tampon test&quot; pain of Weeks (10, 11, and 12) from Weeks (-2, -1 and 0). The primary analysis&#xD;
      of this 2X2 factorial design will involve fitting an Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA)&#xD;
      regression model to the percent change of mean &quot;Tampon test&quot; pain with the two treatment&#xD;
      variables as the predictors while adjusting for the covariate age. We will test if the&#xD;
      interaction between the two treatments in the ANCOVA model is significant at the .05 level.&#xD;
      If the interaction effect is not significant, it will be dropped from the model and the&#xD;
      conclusion will be drawn from the model with main effects only. If significant, the model&#xD;
      with interactions will be adopted. SAS PROC GLM will be used in the analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the case of non-significant interaction, the primary analysis will be based on the ANCOVA&#xD;
      model with main effects of treatments and adjusting for age. Since there are two treatments&#xD;
      under investigation, the primary analysis will use the Bonferroni correction, i.e. will set&#xD;
      alpha level of 0.025 (two-sided) to determine statistical significance. The significance of&#xD;
      the main effect of each treatment will be assessed by t-tests in the ANCOVA model. The aim of&#xD;
      the primary analysis is to determine whether each treatment is superior to placebo, and if&#xD;
      both hypotheses hold, the double treatment therapy will be most effective under the additive&#xD;
      effect assumption of the ANCOVA model. The ANCOVA model compares all subjects who receive&#xD;
      that treatment with all subjects who do not, irrespective of whether they receive the other&#xD;
      treatment, after adjusting for the other treatment and age of subject, and is more powerful&#xD;
      in finding individual treatment effects in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If interaction between treatments is significant, the ANCOVA model with interaction will&#xD;
      estimate the treatment effects for each of the four groups. This model is able to test all 6&#xD;
      contrasts between the four combinations. A hierarchical (gatekeeping) testing strategy to&#xD;
      maintain a family-wise error rate will be adopted as the following: the first stage will&#xD;
      compare desipramine or lidocaine individually to placebo with multiplicity-adjusted p-values.&#xD;
      If a significant difference (one or both null hypotheses rejected) is found for either or&#xD;
      both individual agents, then the analysis will proceed to the second-stage of hypothesis&#xD;
      which will compare the effects of the active desipramine/active lidocaine treatment to the&#xD;
      double placebo. If a significant difference (null hypothesis rejected) is found for combined&#xD;
      therapy over placebo based on the multiplicity-adjusted p-value, then the final (tertiary)&#xD;
      stage of comparison will be performed comparing combined therapy to individual therapy. In&#xD;
      the hierarchical (gatekeeping) testing procedures, inferences in each stage depend on the&#xD;
      acceptance or rejection of null hypotheses in all previously stages, and each stage serves as&#xD;
      a gatekeeper for the stages later in the sequence. In our strategy for the model with&#xD;
      significant interaction effect, if at least one hypothesis has been rejected, then the next&#xD;
      stage of hypotheses will be tested, and the family-wise error rate is controlled at the .05&#xD;
      level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary analyses will include subset analysis, comparison of the double-active treatment&#xD;
      group against the others (placebo and the single-treatment groups) on percent change of mean&#xD;
      &quot;Tampon test&quot; as well as standardized pain measures such as the Brief Pain Inventory and the&#xD;
      McGill Pain Questionnaire. This is to explore if the active desipramine/active lidocaine&#xD;
      treatment has more advantages that may not be shown in the ANCOVA model. The secondary&#xD;
      analysis is to explore supportive evidence to the primary objective of this trial, and no&#xD;
      confirmatory conclusions are needed. In the secondary analysis, confidence intervals and&#xD;
      statistical tests are of exploratory nature and no claims are intended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary and secondary outcome variables will be analyzed according to a modified &quot;intention&#xD;
      to treat&quot; with &quot;last observation carried forward&quot;. The sample analyzed for the primary&#xD;
      outcome will include the first three or fewer pre-randomization Tampon Test measures and the&#xD;
      last three or fewer post-randomization Tampon Test measures, up to and including study Week&#xD;
      12. The subject sample analyzed for drug safety/side effects will include all subjects who&#xD;
      have taken at least one dose of study drug.&#xD;
