  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fanconi anemia (FA) is a disease that affects an individual's bone marrow. It is caused by a&#xD;
      defective gene in the bone marrow cells that produce various types of blood cells.&#xD;
      Individuals with FA may experience fatigue, bleeding, and increased infections. The purpose&#xD;
      of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a gene transfer procedure in&#xD;
      generating new, healthy cells in individuals with FA.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      FA is a rare, inherited disease that is caused by a gene defect and that primarily affects an&#xD;
      individual's bone marrow, resulting in decreased production of blood cells. The lack of white&#xD;
      blood cells affects an individual's ability to fight infections, the lack of platelets may&#xD;
      result in bleeding, and the lack of red blood cells usually leads to anemia. FA is typically&#xD;
      diagnosed in childhood, and there is a high fatality rate. Bone marrow transplants are one&#xD;
      common treatment for FA. However, there are many risks associated with transplantation,&#xD;
      including rejection of the transplanted cells and graft-versus-host disease, a serious side&#xD;
      effect in which donor cells attack the recipient's tissues. This study will use an&#xD;
      experimental gene transfer procedure performed in a laboratory to insert a new FA gene into&#xD;
      the participant's bone marrow cells. The gene-corrected bone marrow cells will then be&#xD;
      re-infused into the participant and participants will be observed for successful gene&#xD;
      transfer. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the FA&#xD;
      gene transfer procedure and to determine the ability of the gene-corrected cells at&#xD;
      generating new, healthy blood cells in individuals with FA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll individuals with FA. Participants will be required to have the initial&#xD;
      bone marrow transfer procedure performed at Cincinnati Children's Hospital, but will be&#xD;
      allowed to see their own doctor for the majority of study visits. Participants will first&#xD;
      attend a screening visit, which will include a physical exam, blood draw for laboratory&#xD;
      testing, and a bone marrow biopsy. Bone marrow cells will be collected from eligible&#xD;
      participants and sent to a laboratory for the FA gene transfer procedure. Several days later,&#xD;
      the gene-corrected cells will be re-infused back into the participants via an intravenous&#xD;
      catheter. Side effects will be closely monitored for 12 hours following the procedure and&#xD;
      participants may be required to spend an overnight in the hospital. Following discharge from&#xD;
      the hospital, participants will be required to stay in the Cincinnati area for 3 days to&#xD;
      undergo daily evaluations and physical examinations. Participants will continue to be&#xD;
      followed very closely for the first year after cell re-infusion. Study visits will be held&#xD;
      weekly for the first 3 weeks, and then every 3 months for the remainder of the year. Visits&#xD;
      will include physical examinations, blood collection, and liver function testing. Bone marrow&#xD;
      testing will occur at Months 3, 6, and 12. Follow-up visits will occur yearly for up to 15&#xD;
      years and will include blood collection, a physical exam, and review of medical history.&#xD;
