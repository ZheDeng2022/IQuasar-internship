    <textblock>
      Charcot-Marie-Tooth type IA (CMT1A) is the most prevalent hereditary peripheral neuropathy.&#xD;
      Demyelination of peripheral nerves is the hallmark of CMT1A. Ascorbic acid has been shown to&#xD;
      have a favorable influence on myelination in in vitro studies and in a mouse model for CMT1A.&#xD;
      We will study the efficacy and safety of ascorbic acid treatment in young patients with&#xD;
      CMT1A.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1A (CMT1A), or hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy type Ia (HMSN&#xD;
      Ia), is an autosomal dominant disease, most often caused by a 1.5 Mb duplication of&#xD;
      chromosome 17, giving rise to three copies of the peripheral myelin protein 22 gene (PMP22).&#xD;
      Mutations in this gene rarely cause CMT1A. It is a primarily demyelinating neuropathy, as has&#xD;
      been shown in nerve conduction studies and in histopathological investigations. The&#xD;
      conduction velocities of peripheral nerves are already slowed at the age of five years.&#xD;
      Longitudinal data show that these conduction velocities do not change during life, indicating&#xD;
      that the degree of demyelination is rather constant during life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CMT1A is characterized clinically by distal muscle weakness and wasting, legs more than arms,&#xD;
      impaired distal sensation, and reduced or absent reflexes. Moreover, foot and hand&#xD;
      deformities are often encountered. In childhood, disease progression has been shown. In&#xD;
      adults, there are indications for disease progression, but properly conducted longitudinal&#xD;
      studies are awaited. Cross-sectional studies show that disease severity in adults is&#xD;
      variable: a group of CMT1A patients is asymptomatic (5-10%), whereas other patients are&#xD;
      wheelchair dependent (5-10%), still most have the classical CMT phenotype. Therapy is&#xD;
      symptomatic and aims at maintaining functional possibilities and learning compensation&#xD;
      mechanisms. There is no medication available that stabilizes or improves the clinical signs&#xD;
      and symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ascorbic acid is needed in in vitro studies for proper myelination of axons (in cultures&#xD;
      containing serum). Recently, in a mouse model for CMT1A it has been shown that ascorbic acid&#xD;
      improves the CMT1A phenotype. Mice (2-4 months old) treated with ascorbic acid once a week&#xD;
      during three months showed an increase in the percentage of myelinating nerve fibers and&#xD;
      showed better results in locomotor tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this phase 2 study we will study the efficacy and safety of ascorbic acid in young&#xD;
      patients with CMT1A. We will investigate whether ascorbic acid induces remyelination by&#xD;
      measuring the nerve conduction of a peripheral nerve during a one year study period. CMT1A&#xD;
      patients aged 12 years or older may cooperate sufficiently in nerve conduction studies. We&#xD;
      include young patients, as clinical signs and symptoms especially develop relatively early in&#xD;
      life. These signs and symptoms are due to axonal dysfunction, secondary to the demyelination.&#xD;
      This is why we will investigate additionally whether there is an effect of ascorbic acid&#xD;
      treatment on axonal function, strength and disabilities.&#xD;
