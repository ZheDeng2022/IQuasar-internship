      This trial is designed to evaluate the safety of treating systemic lupus erythematosus&#xD;
      participants with cyclophosphamide and CAMPATH-1H followed by allogeneic stem cell&#xD;
      transplant. There will be no randomization in this study. All subjects who are determined to&#xD;
      be eligible for the study treatment will receive cyclophosphamide and CAMPATH-1H followed by&#xD;
      allogeneic stem cell transplant. The purpose of the intense chemotherapy is to destroy the&#xD;
      cells in the immune system which may be causing this disease. The purpose of the stem cell&#xD;
      infusion is to produce a normal immune system that will no longer attack body. The study&#xD;
      purpose is to examine whether this treatment will result in improvement in the lupus disease.&#xD;

      This phase I study is designed to select patients with refractory and intractable disease.&#xD;
      SLE patients with impaired visceral organ function and chronic exposure to glucocorticoid&#xD;
      therapy are complicated by significant morbidity, frequent hospitalizations and high-risk of&#xD;
      mortality. For participants in whom the indication is nephritis, active disease must be&#xD;
      present despite at least 6 cycles of monthly pulse cyclophosphamide. Participants with&#xD;
      extra-renal lupus need to fail 3 months of monthly cyclophosphamide. Patients who have an HLA&#xD;
      matched sibling, will be offered allogeneic HSCT. Because of high transplant related toxicity&#xD;
      and mortality in conventional myeloablative regimens, we will utilize a mini-conditioning&#xD;
      regimen. To minimize GvHD, candidates must be 50 years old or younger and in vivo CAMPATH&#xD;
      will be used in the conditioning regimen to deplete infused donor lymphocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peripheral Blood Stem Cell (PBSC) Harvest from Donor PBSC will be mobilized with G-CSF 10&#xD;
      mcg/kg/day (dose may be adjusted to 5-16 mcg/kg/day by PI for toxicity, e.g. flu-like&#xD;
      symptoms) with stem cell collection beginning on day 4. Leukapheresis may be repeated up to&#xD;
      three consecutive days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) If these criteria are not meet the patient (recipient) may not be treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. CD34+ cell count &gt;2.0 x106 CD34+ cells/kg recipient weight&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Gram stein negative&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Culture negative ( after 14 days)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Cell viability at time of final formulation in cyroprotectant mediaâ‰¥ 70% Conditioning&#xD;
           Regimen Cyclophosphamide 50mg/kg/day x 4 days will be given IV over 1 hour in 500 cc of&#xD;
           normal saline. If actual weight is &lt; ideal weight, cyclophosphamide will be given based&#xD;
           on actual weight. If actual weight is &gt; ideal weight, cyclophosphamide will given as&#xD;
           adjusted weight. Adjusted weight = ideal weight + 25% (actual weight minus ideal&#xD;
           weight).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mesna 50mg/kg/day will be given IV over 24 hours in 250 cc of normal saline or D5W starting 2&#xD;
      hours before the first cyclophosphamide dose. Weight base is calculated same as&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide as above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hydration approximately 50-200cc/hour in adults should begin 6 hours before cyclophosphamide&#xD;
      and continue until 24 hours after the last cyclophosphamide dose. Hydration rates need to be&#xD;
      individually adjusted by daily weights to maintain dry weight count. BID weights will be&#xD;
      obtained. Warning: Participants with renal insufficiency are prone to volume overload. Early&#xD;
      institution of ultra filtration or dialysis is recommended. Three-way bladder irrigation may&#xD;
      be needed for those participants who cannot tolerate fluid hydration during cyclophosphamide&#xD;
      administration and for 24 hours after the last dose of cyclophosphamide. In patients on&#xD;
      hemodialysis, cyclophosphamide will be given in the evening and hemodialysis will be&#xD;
      performed in the morning daily until the last dose of cyclophosphamide is administered. Close&#xD;
      coordination with nephrology service is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CAMPATH-1H 30mg/day x 2 days (no dose adjustment) will be given IV over 2 hours in 100 cc of&#xD;
      normal saline. Premedication with acetaminophen 650mg and benadryl 50mg PO/IV will be given&#xD;
      30-60min before infusion. These medications can be repeated as needed. Solumedrol 1 gram will&#xD;
      be given IV 30 min prior to CAMPATH-1H.&#xD;
&#xD;
      G-CSF 5 mcg/kg/day will be started on day 6 if engraftment has not occurred. It will be&#xD;
      continued until absolute neutrophil count reaches at least 500/ul. The dose may be rounded up&#xD;
      or down in order to not waste medication in the vial. NOTE: GCSF may be started earlier, e.g.&#xD;
      day 0, per investigator's discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cyclosporine* will be started on day -3 at 200 mg po BID and adjusted by HPLC levels to&#xD;
      between 150 - 250 or by toxicity (e.g., tremor, renal insufficiency, TTP, etc.). CSA will be&#xD;
      continued for 2 months unless stopped for toxicity. If patient cannot tolerate oral&#xD;
      cycloporine, intravenous cyclosporine continuous infusion (3mg/kg/24hours) and adjusted by&#xD;
      levels can be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)* 1g PO/IV q 12 hrs will be started on day -3 and continued for 6&#xD;
      months. The dosage will be adjusted and tapered off before stopping, unless toxicity mandates&#xD;
      abrupt cessation. MMF will be adjusted by PI according to toxicity, GVHD, and donor&#xD;
      engraftment or donor chimerism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      *Cyclosporine and MMF guidelines dosage and duration can be modified according to&#xD;
      investigators discretion based on side effects, renal function, CBC and GVHD status.&#xD;
