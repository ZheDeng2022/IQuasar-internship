  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects on heart rate and ventricular arrhythmias&#xD;
      (irregular heart beats) of two doses of NatrecorÂ® (a recombinant form of the natural human&#xD;
      peptide normally secreted by the heart in response to heart failure) versus dobutamine,&#xD;
      during the first 24 hours of treatment of decompensated congestive heart failure (CHF).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Advanced congestive heart failure (CHF) accounts for over one million hospital admissions&#xD;
      yearly in the U.S. and is associated with a 2-year mortality rate of up to 40% - 50%&#xD;
      (according to the American Heart Association 1997 and the CONSENSUS Trial Study Group, 1987).&#xD;
      Inpatient therapy for acutely worsening CHF often includes intravenous (IV) agents to reduce&#xD;
      intracardiac filling pressures and to increase cardiac output. Examples of such agents&#xD;
      include drugs that increase the heart muscle contractility such as dobutamine and&#xD;
      phosphodiesterase inhibitors such as milrinone. While these agents do achieve good blood flow&#xD;
      throughout the body in most patients, several studies suggest that arrhythmias (irregular&#xD;
      heart beats) can be increased in some patients treated with dobutamine or milrinone&#xD;
      (according to Smith TW, et al 1997 and Holmes JR et al 1985; and Anderson JL et al 1986).&#xD;
      Arrhythmias are common in patients with advanced CHF and may contribute to their sudden death&#xD;
      rate of 30% to 70% (according to Stevenson WG, et al 1993).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Holter monitoring of patients with CHF shows 90% have premature ventricular contractions and&#xD;
      non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (rapid beating) show up in 60% of patients (according&#xD;
      to Stevenson WG, et al 1994) and atrial fibrillation in approximately 20% of patients&#xD;
      (according to Smith TW, et al 1997). The occurrence of arrhythmias may be associated with a&#xD;
      decrease in ventricular performance, which may worsen the symptoms of acutely decompensated&#xD;
      CHF and complicate patient management. The ventricle is the heart's pumping chamber that&#xD;
      pumps the oxygen-poor blood returning from the body into the arteries of the lungs, where the&#xD;
      blood picks up oxygen. In atrial fibrillation the heart's two small upper chambers (the&#xD;
      atria) quiver instead of beating effectively. Therefore, it is imperative that new therapies&#xD;
      developed for the treatment of decompensated CHF not be associated with the development or an&#xD;
      increase of arrhythmias. Natrecor® has been studied as an IV treatment for decompensated CHF&#xD;
      in over 500 patients. As interstitial fluid (in the lung tissues) accumulates in advanced CHF&#xD;
      cases, the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) increases. However administration of a&#xD;
      continuous IV infusion of Natrecor® resulted in dose-related decreases in PCWP, right atrial&#xD;
      pressure, and systemic vascular resistance, and an increase in cardiac index which is a&#xD;
      measurement of the volume of blood pumped by the heart, (according to Marcus LS, Hart D,&#xD;
      Packer M, et al 1996; Abraham WT at al 1998; and Mills RM et al 1999 ). Beneficial improved&#xD;
      blood flow throughout the body associated with a decrease in the systolic blood pressure -&#xD;
      heart rate index (the double product), suggests that Natrecor® improves cardiac performance&#xD;
      while not increasing estimated myocardial oxygen consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to compare the effects on heart rate and ventricular&#xD;
      arrhythmias of two doses of Natrecor® to dobutamine, during the first 24 hours of treatment&#xD;
      of decompensated CHF. The primary outcome of the study is an evaluation of: (1) average heart&#xD;
      rate, (2) average hourly premature ventricular beats, and (3) average hourly repetitive&#xD;
      beats, all expressed as a change from baseline, as measured by Holter monitoring (a portable&#xD;
      device that provides continuous monitoring of the electrical activity of the heart).&#xD;
      Additional objectives include exploring the effects of Natrecor® and dobutamine on other&#xD;
      Holter outcomes such as couplets, triplets, and ventricular tachycardia and the evaluation of&#xD;
      ventricular ectopy (seven or more single premature ventricular beats per minute or any run of&#xD;
      more than two ventricular ectopic beats) by the application of specific proarrhythmic&#xD;
      criteria. Clinical symptoms are also measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, active-controlled safety study designed to&#xD;
      enroll approximately 240 patients with symptomatic (New York Heart Association [NYHA] Class&#xD;
      III or IV), decompensated CHF for whom treatment with dobutamine or Natrecor® is deemed&#xD;
      appropriate. After a 24-Hour Baseline Holter Monitoring Period, patients are randomized to&#xD;
      dobutamine or Natrecor® (0.015 or 0.03 µg/kg/min). The randomization is stratified by whether&#xD;
      or not the subjects have a known history of Ventricular Tachycardia (non-sustained or&#xD;
      sustained). Treatment assignment is open-label with regard to the study drug (dobutamine or&#xD;
      Natrecor®); assignment to the two Natrecor® dose groups is double-blinded. Dobutamine is to&#xD;
      be administered at a dose of at least 6 µg/kg/min. During the first 24 hours of study drug,&#xD;
      each patient undergoes Holter monitoring. Study drug (dobutamine or Natrecor®) is&#xD;
      administered for at least 24 hours as the single IV vasoactive agent for symptomatic,&#xD;
      decompensated CHF. Other IV vasoactive agents such as milrinone, nitroprusside,&#xD;
      nitroglycerin, and/or any dose of dopamine are not to be added to the study drug during the&#xD;
      first 24 hours of therapy. Dobutamine is not to be added to the Natrecor® infusion during the&#xD;
      first 24 hours of therapy. After 24 hours, the Holter monitor will be removed, and patients&#xD;
      can remain on study drug, if appropriate. Natrecor® patients can continue on their fixed-dose&#xD;
      Natrecor® regimens (still blinded to specific dose group assignment) for up to a maximum of 7&#xD;
      days (with or without the addition of other parenteral agents) or can switch to whatever&#xD;
      treatment is appropriate, at the discretion of the investigator. Patients in the dobutamine&#xD;
      treatment group can continue on study drug as long as appropriate, at the discretion of the&#xD;
      investigator. Systemic hemodynamics (blood pressure and heart rate) are assessed at baseline,&#xD;
      at 15 and 30 minutes, and at 3, 8, 16, and 24 hours following the initiation of study drug.&#xD;
      The study hypothesis is that Natrecor® is not associated with increases in reported&#xD;
      ventricular arrhythmias in patients being treated for symptomatic decompensated CHF.&#xD;
      Continuous IV (intravenous) Infusion for at least 24 hours, and over 24 hours with discretion&#xD;
      of Principal Investigator. Dobutamine starts at 5 mcg/kg/min, may be increased; Natrecor®,&#xD;
      either 0.015 mcg/kg/min or 0.030 mcg/kg/min fixed dose for at least 24 hours, up to a maximum&#xD;
      of 7 days.&#xD;
