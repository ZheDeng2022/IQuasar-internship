    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of&#xD;
      divalproex extended release compared to placebo (sugar pill without medication) in the&#xD;
      treatment of bipolar disorder with moderate to severe hypomania or mild mania. Divalproex&#xD;
      extended release is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the&#xD;
      treatment of epilepsy and for prevention of migraine headaches.&#xD;

      The specific aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of&#xD;
      divalproex extended release (DPX-ER) monotherapy in the treatment of ambulatory bipolar&#xD;
      spectrum disorder with moderate-to-severe hypomania or mild mania in a randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, 8-week trial in 60 outpatients with bipolar&#xD;
      disorder, types I, II, or NOS by DSM-IV-TR criteria. Patients may have concurrent depressive&#xD;
      and anxiety symptoms and syndromes, but not psychotic features or substance dependence. The&#xD;
      primary outcome measure will be change in hypomanic/manic symptoms from baseline to endpoint.&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures will include change in depressive and anxiety symptoms, change in&#xD;
      global severity of illness, concomitant use of adjunctive rescue anxiolytic and hypnotic&#xD;
      medications, adherence with study medication, and degree and severity of side effects&#xD;
      experienced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      a) Methods and Procedures This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel&#xD;
      group, 8-week study in 60 outpatients with bipolar disorder types I, II, or NOS by DSM-IV&#xD;
      criteria (13), whose overall bipolar illness is mild to moderately severe defined as a score&#xD;
      of &gt; 2 but &lt; 5 on the CGI modified for bipolar illness [CGI-BP] (14), and who also have&#xD;
      moderate-to-severe hypomania or mild mania, defined as a YMRS &gt; 10 and &lt; 21 at study entry.&#xD;
      Subjects may have concurrent depressive or anxiety symptoms or syndromes, but they may not&#xD;
      have psychotic features. The primary outcome measure will be change in manic symptoms as&#xD;
      measured by the change in the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS)(17). Secondary outcome measures&#xD;
      will include the Inventory for Depressive Symptoms (IDS)(18), the Hamilton Rating Scale for&#xD;
      Anxiety (HAM-A)(20), the Clinical Global Improvement Scale modified for Bipolar Disorder&#xD;
      (CGI-BP), the (16) Global Assessment of Functioning Scale (GAF), and the Sheehan Disability&#xD;
      Scale (DSD)(18).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medication Dosing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Divalproex ER will be administered at an initial dose of 15mg/kg/day and will be titrated&#xD;
      upward to a dose considered optimal by the investigator based on the subject's clinical&#xD;
      response and adverse events, but not to exceed 30mg/kg/day. As needed (prn) use of lorazepam&#xD;
      (0.5-2.0mg/day) will be allowed for the management of affective symptoms for the first two&#xD;
      weeks of the study; prn lorazpam (0.5-1.0mg/day) will be allowed for the next 2 weeks;&#xD;
      subsequently (for the final 4 weeks of the study), no lorazepam will be permitted. Zaleplon&#xD;
      (10-20mg/day) will be allowed for management of insomnia throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Visit(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Screening Period will last a minimum of 3 to a maximum of 30 days. At the first screening&#xD;
      visit (Visit 0), informed consent will be obtained. The Structured Clinical Interview for&#xD;
      DSM-IV (SCID) will be performed to establish whether the patient meets DSM-IV criteria for&#xD;
      bipolar disorder I, II, or NOS. The YMRS(17), IDS (18), and CGI-BP (16) will be performed to&#xD;
      establish the presence and severity of bipolar affective symptoms. If subjects are currently&#xD;
      on psychotropic medications, these will be tapered. Subjects will need to be off any&#xD;
      psychotropic medications for at least 1 week prior to randomization, 2 weeks if you have been&#xD;
      taking fluoxetine and 4 weeks if you have been receiving depot antipsychotic medication. Mood&#xD;
      charts will be administered to subjects to help them in following their symptoms. Subjects&#xD;
      will meet with the study staff weekly during the period after they have stopped their&#xD;
      previous psychiatric medications and before they start study medication. Medical history will&#xD;
      be reviewed, a physical exam performed, electrocardiogram (EKG) and laboratory studies&#xD;
      (Complete Metabolic Profile, Liver Function Tests (LFT's), CBC with diff + platelets, and&#xD;
      Urinalysis) will be obtained. Based on these evaluations, it will be determined whether&#xD;
      subjects meet entry criteria; subjects meeting these criteria will continue in the screening&#xD;
      process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Visit (last Screening Visit):&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline (Visit 1), subjects whose screening evaluations continue to meet all&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria may enter the study and be randomized. Baseline ratings will be&#xD;
      obtained, including the YMRS, IDS, HAM-A, and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI-BP). The&#xD;
      subject must be evaluated as having modest-to-severe hypomania or mild mania on at least 2&#xD;
      occasions at least 3 days apart to be entered into the randomized phase. Also, the subject's&#xD;
      bipolar disorder must be evaluated as mildly to moderately severe on at least 2 occasions at&#xD;
      least 3 days apart, defined as a CGI-BP of &gt; 2 and &lt; 5, for the patient to be entered into&#xD;
      the randomized phase. Subjects will also be evaluated with the Inventory for Depressive&#xD;
      Symptoms (IDS), Hamilton Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A), Global Assessment of Functioning Scale -&#xD;
      clinician rated (GAF-C), and the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS). Blood pressure, pulse,&#xD;
      height, and weight will be measured. Study medication will be dispensed by the Physician&#xD;
      Investigator in the form of 500mg capsules. The dose starting range of divalproex ER will be&#xD;
      15 mg/kg/day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Period:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study visits will occur every week for the first four weeks of treatment, and then every 2&#xD;
      weeks until the 8th week of treatment. It is expected that divalproex ER will be adjusted to&#xD;
      an optimal dose during the first month of treatment. The following procedures will be&#xD;
      completed at each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Collect unused divalproex ER and perform study drug accountability. A subject's unused&#xD;
           study medication can be redispensed back to the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Perform YMRS, IDS, CGI-BP, HAM-A, GAF-C, and SDS ratings.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assess and record adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Obtain blood pressure, pulse, and weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Record concomitant medication use (from mood chart)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Adjust divalproex ER dose (if necessary) and dispense study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. At study visits 1,2, and 4, laboratories will be obtained (complete metabolic profile,&#xD;
           LFT's, CBC with differential platelets, urinalysis, and serum valproate level).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Final Evaluation (week 8):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following evaluations will be conducted at the completion of, or early withdrawal from,&#xD;
      the 8-week treatment phase. All psychiatric evaluations and all other final study procedures&#xD;
      (including a repeat physical exam, EKG, and laboratory studies) will be completed prior to&#xD;
      the discontinuation of divalproex ER.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Collect unused divalproex ER and perform study drug accountability.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assess and record adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Obtain blood pressure, pulse, weight, and determine BMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Perform YMRS, IDS, CGI-BP, HAM-A, GAF-C and SDS ratings.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Perform physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Obtain laboratories (Complete Metabolic Profile, LFT's, CBC with/diff + platelets,&#xD;
           Urinalysis, and serum Valproate level).&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Repeat EKG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Record concomitant medication use (from mood chart)&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Adjust divalproex ER dose (if necessary) and prescribe drug (if subject has responded&#xD;
           and chooses to continue on divalproex ER), or dispense divalproex ER taper for&#xD;
           discontinuation (if subject has not responded or if subject chooses to discontinue&#xD;
           divalproex ER for any reason).&#xD;
