      Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in men and women worldwide. Shifting trends&#xD;
      in the incidence of lung cancer closely follow the patterns of cigarette smoking, although&#xD;
      other carcinogens have been implicated. Despite intensive over the past several decades, the&#xD;
      5-yr lung-cancer survival rate remains a dismal 8-14%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although lung cancer is not the most common cancer, as the leading cause of cancer-related&#xD;
      deaths in men and women, it is the most deadly (American Cancer Society 2000). Lung cancer is&#xD;
      also the leading cause of cancer deaths in Taiwan. According to the vital statistics of&#xD;
      Department of Health in Taiwan, the incidence of lung cancer is rank of 5th. However, the&#xD;
      rank of cancer fatality is the second and first in men and women, respectively. The mortality&#xD;
      of lung cancer have significant increasing trend in men and women during the two-decade&#xD;
      period. There are 6,555 persons die for lung cancer in 2001.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is only 25% of cases resectable when diagnosed and only 15~18% of cases can be surgical&#xD;
      removed. The postoperative recurrence rate and metastasis rate are also high for NSCLC.&#xD;
      Chemotherapy is used primarily to palliate disease symptoms and prolong survival in patients&#xD;
      with unresectable disease (stage IIIB and IV). However, overall survival benefit is modest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gemcitabine has shown good activity in NSCLC, both as a single agent and in combination with&#xD;
      various other cytotoxic drugs (Eli Lilly and Company 1999). A number of phase I and II&#xD;
      studies in NSCLC have shown good safety and efficacy of two-drug combinations of Gemcitabine&#xD;
      with agents other than cisplatin, including carboplatin, paclitaxel, vinorelbine, and&#xD;
      docetaxel (Eli Lilly and Company 1999).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gemcitabine plus cisplatin (GC) is one of the most active regimens in the treatment fir stage&#xD;
      IIIB/IV NSCLC patients. In phase II studies, 26-54% stage IIIB/IV NSCLC patients respond to&#xD;
      GC treatment. Good median and 1-year survival have been consistently observed (Abratt et al,&#xD;
      1997; Crino et al, 1997; Einhorn, 1997; Shepherd et al, 1997) In randomized phase III&#xD;
      studies, GC demonstrated the superior survival versus cisplatin alone (Sandler A et al.&#xD;
      2000), significantly higher response rate versus a three-drug combination of cisplatin,&#xD;
      mitomycin C and ifosfamideb (Crino L et al. 1999).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Schiller JH et al. conducted a randomized study to determine whether any of three&#xD;
      chemotherapy regimens was superior to cisplatin and paclitaxel in patients with advanced&#xD;
      non-small-cell lung cancer (Schiller JH et al. 2000). Patients with advanced non-small-cell&#xD;
      lung cancer were randomly assigned to a reference regimen of cisplatin and paclitaxel or to&#xD;
      one of three experimental regimens: cisplatin and gemcitabine, cisplatin and docetaxel, or&#xD;
      carboplatin and paclitaxel. However, none of four chemotherapy regimens offered a significant&#xD;
      advantage over the others in the treatment of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. GC&#xD;
      provided longer time to progression than other three regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abratt et al (1997) used GC in stage IIIB/IV patients delivering cisplatin on day 15 resulted&#xD;
      in goodresponse rate (52%), median survival (13 months) associated with low haematological&#xD;
      toxicity and very few dose modifications of either gemicitabine or ciplatin. This schedule&#xD;
      seems to be feasible for induction treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Docetaxel plus cisplatin is one of options of front line treatment. TAX326- a phase III trial&#xD;
      studied docetaxel + cisplatin or carboplatin vs vinorelbine/cisplatin (VC) as first-line&#xD;
      therapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The schedule of chemotherapy was 75&#xD;
      mg/m² of docetaxel followed by 75 mg/m² of cisplatin repeated every 3 weeks and Vinorelbine&#xD;
      25 mg/m2 IV day 1, 8, 15, 22 and Cisplatin 100 mg/m2 IV day 1 every 4 weeks. The overall&#xD;
      response rate were 32% (docetaxel+cisplatin) and 25%(VC). Docetaxel plus cisplatin showed&#xD;
      survival benefit compared to VC (1-year survival rate: 46% v.s. 41%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several phase II trials have investigated the efficacy and safety of Gemcitabine as a single&#xD;
      agent, second-line therapy. Table below summarizes the results of the phase II trials.These&#xD;
      trials concluded that gemcitabine has a modest activity as second-line chemotherapy for&#xD;
      NSCLC. It has the advantage to be well tolerated and may thus be one drug to be proposed to&#xD;
      the patients who have disease progression after a first-line chemotherapy and who ask for&#xD;
      further treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the initial development of docetaxel and paclitaxel, these drugs routinely were&#xD;
      administered once every 3 weeks. However, weekly administration of both these agents appears&#xD;
      to offer several advantages in terms of toxicity. Both agents can be administered weekly with&#xD;
      markedly decreased myelosuppression, while maintaining the same or increased dose intensity(&#xD;
      Fennelly D et al 1997; Seidman AD et al 1998; Hainsworth JD et al 1998).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Phase I trial demonstrated that docetaxel could be administered weekly at a maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose of 43 mg/m2/week, with fatigue and asthenia as the dose-limiting toxicities&#xD;
      (Hainsworth JD et al 1998). At a weekly dose of 36 mg/m2, docetaxel was extremely well&#xD;
      tolerated, with no significant myelosuppression and only occasional NCIC-CTG Grade 3 or 4&#xD;
      non-hematologic toxicities. The recommended dose was 36 mg/m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four clinical studies of single-agent weekly docetaxel in patients with NSCLC have been&#xD;
      reported. As second-line therapy for NSCLC, weekly docetaxel has been studied by 3 groups&#xD;
      (Baylor-Charles 2000; Serke M et al 2001; Garcia-Lopez JL et al 2000 ), and Hainsworth JD and&#xD;
      his colleagues studied weekly docetaxel as first-line treatment of NSCLC (Hainsworth JD et al&#xD;
      2000).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 3 studies of weekly docetaxel as a single agent, second-line consistently demonstrated&#xD;
      efficacy and similar toxicity profiles. Objective response rates ranged from 11% to 26.7%,&#xD;
      and the percentage of patients who responded or maintained stable disease ranged from 37.5%&#xD;
      to 66.7%. Docetaxel was generally well tolerated in each study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weekly docetaxel is being studied in combination with other commonly used NSCLC&#xD;
      chemotherapeutic agents including carboplatin, navelbine, and gemcitabine. These combinations&#xD;
      are being studied in both first- and second-line settings. Second line chemotherapy with&#xD;
      docetaxel may affect survival (TAX 318, 1 year survival 37% vs. 11%). However, the optimal&#xD;
      sequence of chemotherapy was rarely explored. Weekly docetaxel may offer better tolerability&#xD;
      vs. 3-weekly schedule when combining docetaxel to cisplatin. Based upon these studied, we&#xD;
      choose weekly docetaxel in combination with cisplatin as our regimen. We expected the regimen&#xD;
      would be effective and well tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the data above, this study proposed to compare the efficacy and safety of the two&#xD;
      regimens (weekly docetaxel plus cisplatin followed by gemcitabine vs. gemcitabine plus&#xD;
      cisplatin followed by weekly docetaxel) in metastatic of locally advanced non-small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
