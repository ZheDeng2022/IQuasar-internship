      To evaluate current and novel therapies and management strategies for children with asthma.&#xD;
      The emphasis is on clinical trials that help identify optimal therapy for children with&#xD;
      different asthma phenotypes, genotypes, and ethnic backgrounds and children at different&#xD;
      developmental stages.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Asthma is a complex disease that often starts early in life. Exacerbations can be triggered&#xD;
      by a number of agents such as allergens, respiratory infections, environmental tobacco smoke&#xD;
      and pollutants, drugs, chemicals, exercise, cold air, infections and strong emotion making&#xD;
      asthma therapy difficult and sometimes complicated. Multiple medications are often required&#xD;
      to treat symptoms (bronchodilator agents such as beta-2 adrenergic agonists, theophylline,&#xD;
      and anticholinergics), as well the underlying disease process (anti-inflammatory agents such&#xD;
      as inhaled and systemic corticosteroids, cromolyn sodium and nedocromil; and leukotriene&#xD;
      modifiers).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalence of asthma is increasing in all age groups, but most particularly in children&#xD;
      under the age of 18 years. In 1992, the prevalence of self-reported asthma among persons&#xD;
      under 18 years of age was 7.2 percent, compared to 5.1 percent among all persons. The most&#xD;
      rapid increase in asthma has occurred in children under 5 years old, with rates increasing&#xD;
      over 160 percent over the past 15 years. Among all ages, over 450,000 hospitalizations, 5,000&#xD;
      deaths, and more than 100 million days of restricted activity are due to asthma every year.&#xD;
      Yet the burden of asthma disproportionately affects children. For example, asthma&#xD;
      hospitalization rates are highest among persons age 0-4 years, and have increased over 28&#xD;
      percent in the last 15 years; mortality rates increased faster among those aged 5 to-12 years&#xD;
      than among those age 15-34 years and neither changes in disease coding nor improved&#xD;
      recognition of asthma fully explain these increases. Nearly one third of children restrict&#xD;
      their activities due to asthma, including participation in physical education and sports.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite major advances in understanding the etiology and pathophysiology of asthma and the&#xD;
      development of new therapeutic modalities to control symptoms and prevent exacerbations,&#xD;
      effective therapies are not widely used in the pediatric health care community. Further, the&#xD;
      long term effects and side effects of asthma medications in children, especially children&#xD;
      under the age of 12 years, are not well understood. Much remains to be learned about the&#xD;
      impact of asthma therapy at different ages and at different points in the natural history of&#xD;
      the asthma in altering the progression, chronicity, or severity of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is an urgent need to rapidly evaluate new and existing therapeutic approaches for&#xD;
      children with asthma, and to disseminate the findings to health care professionals, patients&#xD;
      and the public. There are several reasons why a pediatric asthma clinical research network&#xD;
      will accelerate clinical research and meet this need. The highly variable and sometimes&#xD;
      complicated clinical manifestations of asthma often make it difficult to accumulate a large&#xD;
      number of comparable patients in one center. Further, uniformity in treatment protocols may&#xD;
      reduce the number of patients needed at each clinical center. Also, the network mechanism&#xD;
      will help pool the necessary clinical expertise and administrative resources to facilitate&#xD;
      the conduct of multiple and novel therapeutic trials in a timely, efficient manner. This, in&#xD;
      turn, would promote rapid dissemination of research findings to health care professionals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prevention of Early Asthma in Kids (PEAK) began recruitment in January 2001 and evaluated&#xD;
      whether administering inhaled corticosteroids to 24-48 month old children at risk of&#xD;
      developing asthma prevented the development of persistent asthma. All subjects were expected&#xD;
      to be randomized prior to December 2001 with study completion by September 2004. The study&#xD;
      was a double blind, randomized, placebo controlled, parallel comparison of inhaled&#xD;
      fluticasone to placebo. There was a four week run-in period to qualify and characterize&#xD;
      children. A total of 285 children were randomized to one of two treatment groups; one&#xD;
      receiving active treatment, the other placebo. The study was based on a continuous treatment&#xD;
      schedule for a period of twenty-four months, followed by an observation period of one year&#xD;
      during which the main outcomes were assessed. The primary outcome measure was the number of&#xD;
      asthma-free days. Secondary outcomes included number of exacerbations, use of asthma&#xD;
      medications, and lung function. There were three specific objectives of the study: 1) To&#xD;
      assess if chronic therapy with inhaled corticosteroids initiated in children four years or&#xD;
      less at high risk of developing asthma can prevent the development of significant asthma at&#xD;
      four to six years of age, 2) To determine if asthma therapy as described above can prevent&#xD;
      both losses in lung function and the development of bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR)&#xD;
      associated with early onset asthma, and 3) To assess potential side effects that may be&#xD;
      associated with long term use of inhaled steroids in early life. PEAK study outcomes were&#xD;
      presented at the 2005 annual meetings of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and&#xD;
      Immunology and the American Thoracic Society. A manuscript has been submitted for publication&#xD;
      by the New England Journal of Medicine.&#xD;
