  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cure rates for patients with high grade glioma remain disappointing, in part because tumor&#xD;
      cells are often resistant to chemotherapy, and because using higher doses of chemotherapy&#xD;
      causes damage to normal blood cells. This trial is designed to try to overcome both of these&#xD;
      barriers. The idea is to make tumor cells more sensitive to a chemotherapy agent,&#xD;
      Temozolomide, by using 06Benzylguanine (06BG). In addition, patients will have a portion of&#xD;
      their blood cells modified by the insertion of a chemotherapy resistance gene which may help&#xD;
      protect blood cells from damage by the combination of the Temozolomide and 06BG.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of temozolomide (TEM) both during and after irradiation is a promising new approach&#xD;
      for the treatment of patients with high-grade glioma. However, this treatment is limited by&#xD;
      tumor cell resistance and therapy-related hematologic toxicity. To overcome TEM resistance,&#xD;
      in this study we will add the chemotherapy sensitizing drug O6-Benzylguanine (BG). To&#xD;
      overcome hematologic toxicity, patients will receive autologous hematopoietic stem cells&#xD;
      transduced with a chemotherapy resistance gene designed to protect these cells from&#xD;
      subsequent therapy with this drug combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The potential benefit of using transduced blood stem cells is the possibility for dose&#xD;
      escalation of TEM, since hematologic toxicity has heretofore limited higher doses.&#xD;
      Transduction will be accomplished with a retroviral vector carrying MGMTP140K, which codes&#xD;
      for a mutated form of the resistance protein methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT).&#xD;
      Successful transduction of hematopoietic cells with MGMTP140K makes them resistant to the&#xD;
      toxic effects of both TEM + BG. Repeated doses of these drugs should therefore result in an&#xD;
      increase in the percentage of transduced (and thus protected) blood stem cells, thus reducing&#xD;
      the likelihood of hematologic toxicity with further therapy. Accordingly, patients who are&#xD;
      tolerating therapy well and who have laboratory evidence of chemoprotection will receive&#xD;
      intrapatient dose escalation of TEM + BG during courses 2-6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients must be between 5 and 55 years of age and have newly-diagnosed high-grade&#xD;
      glioma (anaplastic astrocytoma or glioblastoma multiforme) which cannot be completely&#xD;
      resected. No prior therapy other than surgery is allowed, and patients must have adequate&#xD;
      performance status and organ function as defined in the protocol.&#xD;
