      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Heritable disorders of connective tissue are genetic conditions that can affect the skin&#xD;
      and other parts of the body. They are related to mutations in genes that are responsible for&#xD;
      building tissues. The symptoms differ among disorders. Researchers want to study which genes&#xD;
      may be responsible for different disorders. They will be performing a long-term (up to 10&#xD;
      years) study and a study that requires a single visit. These studies will look at how these&#xD;
      disorders affect the body and what genes may cause these conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To perform one-time and long-term studies of people who have heritable disorders of&#xD;
      connective tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 2 years of age who have or may have a heritable disorder of connective&#xD;
      tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam, medical history, and blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be on one of two parts of this study. The longitudinal arm will&#xD;
           require long-term study over about 10 years. The mutational analysis arm will involve a&#xD;
           single visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Longitudinal arm participants must be at least 12 years of age. They will have study&#xD;
           visits at regular intervals for up to 10 years. The tests given at these visits may&#xD;
           include all or some of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood, saliva, urine, and skin samples&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Heart and lung function tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Magnetic resonance imaging scans of the neck, chest, spine, and abdomen&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other imaging studies such as x-rays, bone density scans, and ultrasounds&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaires about sleep, pain, and quality of life&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Photographs of affected areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mutational analysis arm participants will have a single study visit. They will provide&#xD;
           blood and saliva samples. They will provide tissue from a skin biopsy. They will also&#xD;
           let the researchers take photos of any affected body parts. They will complete&#xD;
           questionnaires about sleep, pain, and quality of life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heritable disorders of connective tissue are a heterogenous group of genetic conditions&#xD;
      caused by defects of extracellular matrix elements such as collagen, elastin,&#xD;
      mucopolysaccharides or related biomolecules. The genetic cause of many connective tissue&#xD;
      disorders has been elucidated, while others are yet to be discovered or further defined.&#xD;
      While clinical diagnostic criteria have been established for several of the connective tissue&#xD;
      syndromes, many share features that overlap the known descriptions of other connective tissue&#xD;
      disorders. Therefore, further characterization and phenotype/genotype correlation is needed&#xD;
      to adequately diagnose and find treatments for these yet-to-be genotyped disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An aim of this work is the examination of the cardiovascular, musculoskeletal and&#xD;
      neurological complications of heritable connective tissue disorders (HDCT) and the natural&#xD;
      history of these complications. Through mutational analysis for genes known to cause the&#xD;
      HDCT, as well as identification of new genes, we will assess the relationship between&#xD;
      specific mutations and their associated disease phenotypes. Through the analysis of tissue&#xD;
      specimens obtained from patients with HDCT, we will identify the biochemical pathways that&#xD;
      lead to connective tissue fragility. We will continue to assess the severity, prevalence, and&#xD;
      pattern of pain and related psychological and quality of life dimensions in HDCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The resulting understanding of genotype/phenotype correlations and biochemical pathways will&#xD;
      enhance our understanding of connective tissue biology. This knowledge has the potential to&#xD;
      lead to new treatments for not only patients with HDCT, but also for pathological conditions&#xD;
      associated with the weakness of connective tissues in aging.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals and their family members will be offered enrollment if they have an&#xD;
             established or suspected diagnosis of Marfan, Stickler, or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, or&#xD;
             Overlap connective tissue disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Determination of eligibility will be made by review of prior records.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In some cases, a screening evaluation to establish the diagnosis may be performed&#xD;
             subjects may be excluded from further participation if the diagnosis is ruled out.&#xD;
             Cytogenetic analysis may be necessary to rule out a chromosomal abnormality that has&#xD;
             overlapping features with HDCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical inclusion criteria require: personal or family history of one or more of the&#xD;
             following features in a pattern suggestive of a heritable connective tissue disorder:&#xD;
             Marfanoid body habitus, aortic dilatation and/or dissection, ectopia lentis, detached&#xD;
             retina, vitreous degeneration and/or early onset high myopia, posterior cleft palate,&#xD;
             joint laxity and/or dislocation, premature osteoarthritis, skin fragility, striae,&#xD;
             easy bruising and/or hyperextensibile skin, pectus excavatum or carinatum, scoliosis,&#xD;

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The only exclusion criterion is inability to provide informed consent, or the absence&#xD;
             of a guardian who is authorized to provide informed consent in the case of minor&#xD;
             subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  There will be no exclusion based upon age, gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, or&#xD;
             any other factor except ability to provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant and nursing women may be limited in their participation in some aspects of&#xD;
             the study (e.g. ionizing radiation exposure or MRI) during the time that they are&#xD;
