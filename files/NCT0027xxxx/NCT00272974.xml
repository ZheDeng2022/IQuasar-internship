  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study was designed to measure the effects of male and female condom promotion on STI&#xD;
      prevalence and reported condom use by sex workers and their partners. It also examined&#xD;
      whether the intensity of the education and support given to intended users affected adoption&#xD;
      and sustained use of these methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study was:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To test the effect of supplementing community-based male and female condom promotion&#xD;
           with clinic-based counseling, measured in terms of the level of protection in high-risk&#xD;
           sex acts and STI prevalence.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary objectives of the study included:&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To monitor short- and medium terms changes in the proportion of protected sex acts among&#xD;
           commercial sex workers after the female condom is added to a male condom distribution&#xD;
           system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To examine short-term and medium-term changes in STI prevalence when the female condom&#xD;
           is added to the male condom distribution system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To measure the incremental cost-effectiveness of adding female condom promotion to&#xD;
           existing male condom distribution systems&#xD;

      This three-phased study examined ways to improve services for the prevention of STIs among&#xD;
      commercial sex workers. This study was conducted in identical fashion in two sites (Tamatave&#xD;
      and Antananarivo) in Madagascar. It tested whether condom promotion through community-based&#xD;
      counseling or clinic based counseling leads to an increased level of protection among&#xD;
      high-risk sex acts and a subsequent decrease in STI infection rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase I, women at each site were randomly assigned to a study arm receiving a&#xD;
      community-based male condom promotion intervention, or a study arm receiving community-based&#xD;
      male condom promotion supplemented with clinic-based counseling. Randomization was&#xD;
      accomplished by the use of sequentially-numbered sealed, opaque envelopes containing the&#xD;
      group assignment. The randomization list was stratified by study site. Phase I began with&#xD;
      baseline measurement of male condom use and STI prevalence. Participants returned three&#xD;
      times, at two month intervals, for follow-up. At each visit, face-to-face interviews were&#xD;
      conducted to estimate the proportion of protected sex acts. At the third visit only,&#xD;
      participants were tested for gonococcal, chlamydial, and trichomonal infections. This&#xD;
      reliance on a combination of biologic and behavioral outcomes helped to reduce any bias&#xD;
      brought on by the inherent limitations of either of these measures on its own.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Half the women completing Phase I at each site were then randomized to a Phase II study arm&#xD;
      receiving a community-based male and female condom promotion intervention, while the other&#xD;
      half entered Phase II receiving the same community-based male and female condom promotion&#xD;
      supplemented with clinic-based counseling. This sequential randomization scheme allowed&#xD;
      measurement of the short-term (within 6 months) effect of clinic-based counseling on male&#xD;
      condom use and STI prevalence, and the short-term effect of clinic-based counseling on male&#xD;
      condom + female condom use and STI prevalence. A similar data collection process was used,&#xD;
      with measurement of male and female condom use in all three visits, and STI testing in the&#xD;
      third visit only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase III, participants were followed for an additional 6 months, in the same intervention&#xD;
      group to which they were assigned at the beginning of Phase II, to assess the medium-term&#xD;
      impacts of the female condom, after participants had a chance to become accustomed to the&#xD;
      female condom.&#xD;
