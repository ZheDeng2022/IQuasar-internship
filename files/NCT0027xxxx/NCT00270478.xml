      This study will examine the use of hydroxyurea and erythropoietin for treating sickle cell&#xD;
      disease in patients who also have kidney disease or pulmonary hypertension (high blood&#xD;
      pressure in the lungs). Hydroxyurea increases production of fetal hemoglobin in the red blood&#xD;
      cells of patients with sickle cell disease, reducing the amount of sickle cells that cause&#xD;
      pain and other complications requiring hospitalizations. However, hydroxyurea treatment has&#xD;
      limitations: patients with sickle cell disease who have developed kidney disease may not be&#xD;
      able to get the full benefit of the medicine, and hydroxyurea alone may not be able to treat&#xD;
      life-threatening complications such as pulmonary hypertension or stroke. This study will&#xD;
      determine which of two dosing schedules of hydroxyurea and erythropoietin is more effective&#xD;
      for treating patients with sickle cell disease who also have kidney disease or pulmonary&#xD;
      hypertension, and will examine whether the two drugs can lower blood pressure in the lungs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age and older with sickle cell anemia and kidney disease or pulmonary&#xD;
      hypertension, or both, may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical&#xD;
      history, physical examination, blood tests, a 6-minute walk test (test to see how far the&#xD;
      subject can walk in 6 minutes), and echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart to measure blood&#xD;
      pressure in the lungs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo the following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stabilization Phase: Patients take 2 hydroxyurea tablets a day until their fetal hemoglobin&#xD;
      levels stabilize, usually over 2 to 4 months. They have blood tests every 2 weeks to monitor&#xD;
      hemoglobin and fetal hemoglobin levels. At some time during this period, they undergo a test&#xD;
      to measure kidney function, in which they are injected with an iodine-containing dye and wear&#xD;
      a small pump for 1 day that injects a small amount of dye under the skin over 24 hours. They&#xD;
      come to the clinic for 2 or 3 blood tests collected over 4 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sequence I (Standard): When the fetal hemoglobin levels have been stable for 2 months,&#xD;
      patients have a repeat echocardiogram and 6-minute walk test. Erythropoietin is then added to&#xD;
      the hydroxyurea regimen. It is given 3 days a week, as an injection under the skin, along&#xD;
      with iron supplements. Patients have blood tests and blood pressure measurements every week&#xD;
      or every other week. Patients with pulmonary hypertension have another echocardiogram and&#xD;
      6-minute walk test once the hemoglobin level is stable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sequence II (Cycled): When hemoglobin levels have stabilized with hydroxyurea once a day and&#xD;
      erythropoietin 3 times a week, the hydroxyurea is adjusted so that the amount taken in 7 days&#xD;
      is &quot;cycled&quot; over 4 days, and the erythropoietin is cycled over 3 days, with the dose&#xD;
      increased twice, every 3 to 4 weeks. Blood pressure and hemoglobin are monitored once or&#xD;
      twice a month. Patients with pulmonary hypertension have another echocardiogram and 6-minute&#xD;
      walk test once the hemoglobin level is stable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who develop complications while taking the drugs have their treatment regimens&#xD;
      adjusted as needed.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disease that afflicts over eighty thousand Americans,&#xD;
      4 to 5,000 newborns per year in the US, and 100s of thousands of children and adults&#xD;
      world-wide. This disease arises from a single amino acid mutation of the beta globin chain of&#xD;
      hemoglobin, which results in abnormal polymerization of deoxygenated hemoglobin. The&#xD;
      deceptively simple biologic origin for SCD belies the debilitating chronic multi-faceted&#xD;
      clinical syndrome with which it is associated; SCD is characterized by lifelong hemolysis,&#xD;
      chronic anemia, recurrent painful vaso-occlusive crises (VOC), hepatic, renal,&#xD;
      musculo-skeletal, and central nervous system complications, and a shortened life-expectancy.&#xD;
      Our group has found an up to 33% incidence of pulmonary hypertension in adult patients with&#xD;
      SCD who were screened and followed prospectively; with two-year follow-up, this pulmonary&#xD;
      hypertension is associated with a 10-fold increased mortality rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hydroxyurea has emerged as a useful therapy in sickle cell disease. It is a cell-cycle&#xD;
      specific agent that blocks DNA synthesis by inhibiting ribonucleotide reductase, the enzyme&#xD;
      that converts ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides. Hydroxyurea has been shown to induce&#xD;
      the production of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) in patients with sickle cell anemia, with associated&#xD;
      diminished morbidity and, likely, mortality in these patients. Any HbF is good in SCD,&#xD;
      although it is estimated that levels of 20 percent HbF are required to substantially reduce&#xD;
      the sickling propensity of red cells and to modulate disease severity. The majority of&#xD;
      patients with SCD respond to hydroxyurea with a more than two-fold increase in HbF levels; in&#xD;
      some patients the percent of HbF exceeds 10 or 15 percent, but it is not uniformly&#xD;
      distributed in all cells, i.e. has a hetero-cellular rather than a pan-cellular distribution.&#xD;
      The mechanism through which hydroxyurea augments fetal Hgb is incompletely characterized. An&#xD;
      additional benefit of hydroxyurea may be through effects on the nitric oxide (NO) system.&#xD;
      Recently, members of our group found that hydroxyurea therapy is associated with the&#xD;
      intravascular and intra-erythrocytic generation of NO, and that NO increases HbF expression&#xD;
      via the guanylyl cyclase/cGMP dependent pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have treated more than 30 patients chronically with hydroxyurea to determine hematological&#xD;
      changes Iongitudinally, and have established the maximal HbF raising effect of hydroxyurea in&#xD;
      these patients. We have found that the levels of HbF that are induced by hydroxyurea alone&#xD;
      are insufficient, and insufficiently widely distributed, to ameliorate the life-threatening&#xD;
      complications of pulmonary HTN and of on-going hemolysis in patients with sickle cell&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Earlier studies had suggested that the addition of erythropoietin (Erythropoietin) therapy to&#xD;
      chronic hydroxyurea therapy may induce fetal hemoglobin at higher, more widely distributed,&#xD;
      levels. We plan to test this in patients with sickle cell disease who have chronic kidney&#xD;
      disease, which, presumably, leaves them with a depressed Erythropoietin reserve and an&#xD;
      inability to tolerate standard doses of F-inducing therapy with hydroxyurea, and in patients&#xD;
      with pulmonary HTN, which carries an ominous prognosis in SCD. A secondary endpoint of this&#xD;
      study will be to evaluate if hydroxyurea plus Erythropoietin therapy can improve&#xD;
      cardiovascular aerobic capacity in general, and in particular minimize symptoms and morbidity&#xD;
      in patients with both chronic kidney disease and pulmonary HTN.&#xD;
