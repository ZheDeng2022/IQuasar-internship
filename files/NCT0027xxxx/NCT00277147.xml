  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate a new (conjugate) vaccine for typhoid fever, which remains a serious&#xD;
      disease especially difficult to treat in developing countries. Salmonella typhi, the bacteria&#xD;
      causing typhoid fever, have become resistant to several antibiotics increasing the difficulty&#xD;
      of treating the disease. The disease may have serious complications effecting bones, brain,&#xD;
      and intestines, with permanent injury or death. Methods to control typhoid fever, such as a&#xD;
      sanitary water and food supply, along with effective sewage treatment, are not likely to be&#xD;
      available soon in those countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NIH scientists developed a vaccine called Vi, made of a polysaccharide (a chain of linked&#xD;
      sugars) from the surface of Salmonella typhi, the bacteria that cause typhoid fever. It has&#xD;
      been approved by the World Health Organization and is licensed in 94 countries. It is&#xD;
      effective in adults but not in young children. Clinical trials have shown that chemically&#xD;
      binding the Vi to a protein to form a &quot;conjugate vaccine&quot; has improved and extended its&#xD;
      efficacy to children (conjugate vaccines to other bacteria, notably meningitis causing&#xD;
      bacteria have been used extensively and successfully). Now NIH scientists have developed&#xD;
      another vaccine for typhoid fever - using a polysaccharide from fruit, known as pectin. The&#xD;
      pectin has been chemically treated so that it resembles Vi. The treated pectin, O-acetyl&#xD;
      pectin, is bound to a protein; exoprotein A, (rEPA). The result is a conjugate, as was formed&#xD;
      for Vi. Similarly to the Vi conjugate it induces antibodies against Salmonella typhi in&#xD;
      laboratory animals. If the O-acetyl pectin conjugate proves successful, it will be evaluated&#xD;
      in children ages 5 to 14 years old and in infants, toward using it with routine vaccines for&#xD;
      infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers ages 18 to 45 who do not have an allergy to fruit pectin and who have not been&#xD;
      vaccinated against nor had typhoid fever within the last 5 years may be eligible for this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers will undergo several tests at their first visit to the clinic for this study. A&#xD;
      blood sample (about 2/3 of an ounce) will be taken to test for HIV, hepatitis B and C,&#xD;
      complete blood count, liver functions, blood chemistry and pregnancy in women of childbearing&#xD;
      age. The blood sample will also be tested for antibodies to Vi, rEPA (the protein of the&#xD;
      conjugate), and pectin. There will also be a urine collection for testing. If the laboratory&#xD;
      tests are acceptable, volunteers will be asked to return to the clinic on a...&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Typhoid fever remains a common, serious and increasingly difficult to treat disease in&#xD;
      developing countries. Control measures, such as safe drinking water, and food, and effective&#xD;
      sewage, are not likely to be available soon in many of these countries. In the early 1990's&#xD;
      most Salmonella typhi from the Mekong Delta region were resistant to chloramphenicol and&#xD;
      ampicillin and treatment required new antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin. Now, resistance of&#xD;
      S. typhi has spread to ciprofloxacin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are three licensed vaccines for typhoid fever. The whole cell parenteral and the oral&#xD;
      attenuated vaccines confer only incomplete immunity of limited duration and cannot be&#xD;
      incorporated into the routine vaccination of infants. S. typhi capsular polysaccharide (Vi)&#xD;
      is safe, easily standardized and only one injection confers about 70% immunity in individuals&#xD;
      greater than 5 years of age for at least 3 years. Its immunogenicity is lesser in 2-4&#xD;
      year-olds and it does not elicit protective antibody levels in children less than 2&#xD;
      years-old. Vi does not elicit a booster response at any age (age-related T-cell independent&#xD;
      antibody response).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The immunogenicity of Vi is improved by covalently binding it to a protein to form a&#xD;
      conjugate. Vi conjugates were safe and more immunogenic than Vi in adults, in 5-14 year-olds&#xD;
      and in children 2-4 year-olds, and showed 90% efficacy in the 2-5 year olds for 47 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      O-acetyl pectin mimics the antigenic properties of Vi. Although not immunogenic alone,&#xD;
      O-acetyl pectin when conjugated induces serum Vi antibodies with booster responses in mice&#xD;
      and in guinea pigs albeit at slightly lower levels than Vi conjugates in mice. Double&#xD;
      immunodiffusion against mouse anti-Vi revealed antigenic identity between O-acetyl pectin and&#xD;
      Vi conjugates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are advantages to using pectin as the polysaccharide component of conjugate vaccines&#xD;
      for typhoid. Pectin is abundant, has no LPS and requires a simple chemical modification to&#xD;
      prepare its di-O-acetyl derivative. Our yields of O-acetyl pectin-rEPA were similar to those&#xD;
      of Vi-rEPA. Because it may not be reliable to extrapolate data from animals to humans and&#xD;
      especially to infants, we propose clinical evaluation of O-acetyl pectin bound to the&#xD;
      recombinant protein A of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (rEPA).&#xD;
