  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if adalimumab is an effective for the skin&#xD;
      manifestations of sarcoidosis.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The cutaneous lesions of sarcoidosis are often disfiguring and can produce functional&#xD;
      impairment. They tend to be hard to treat with most topical therapies and often require&#xD;
      systemic medications which carry the risk of significant side effects. Often such treatments&#xD;
      are withheld unless there is a need to use them for visceral involvement. There is thus an&#xD;
      unmet need for safe and effective treatments for these patients. In addition there is&#xD;
      essentially no controlled trial data for any treatments for cutaneous sarcoidosis. This study&#xD;
      is intended to determine if adalimumab might offer a viable therapeutic option for this&#xD;
      condition by comparing the response of cutaneous sarcoid lesions to this drug as compared to&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subject is &gt; 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject must have moderate to severe cutaneous sarcoidosis with chronic indurated&#xD;
             lesions (papules, nodules, and/or plaques), which histopathologically show&#xD;
             non-caseating granulomas with negative special stains for microorganisms (AFB and PAS&#xD;
             or GMS). Accepted clinical variants include, but are not necessarily limited to the&#xD;
             following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  lupus pernio&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  nodular&#xD;

               -  annular&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  angiolupoid&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  plaque&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  psoriasiform&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. For purposes of this study &quot;moderate to severe cutaneous sarcoidosis&quot; is defined as&#xD;
             the presence of sarcoidal skin lesions with any of the following features:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  At least 5 easily visible facial lesions, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Disease which involves &gt; 3% BSA, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Disease which confers functional impairment (e.g. nasal or visual field&#xD;
                  obstruction), or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Disease which confers significant symptoms of itching and/or pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. If female, subject is either not of childbearing potential, defined as postmenopausal&#xD;
             for at least 1 year or surgically sterile (bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral&#xD;
             oophorectomy, or hysterectomy), or is using one of the following methods of birth&#xD;
             control for the duration of the study and 90 days after study completion:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  condoms, sponge, foams, jellies, diaphragm, or intrauterine device&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  contraceptives (oral or parenteral) for three months prior to study drug&#xD;
                  administration&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  a vasectomized sole partner&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at&#xD;
             screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subject must have no history of nor evidence of tuberculosis, either active or&#xD;
             previously treated. This determination will be based on a negative PPD skin test and&#xD;
             negative chest radiograph at screening, negative history of previous tuberculosis, and&#xD;
             negative history of previous exposure to tuberculosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subject must be willing and able to give informed consent and to comply with the&#xD;
             requirements of the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subject must be willing and able to self-administer SC injections or to have a&#xD;
             qualified person available to administer SC injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. The following criteria for concomitant treatments of sarcoidosis must be met:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Topical therapies (corticosteroids) must be discontinued at least 2 weeks prior&#xD;
                  to baseline visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Intralesional therapies (corticosteroids) must be discontinued at least 4 weeks&#xD;
                  prior to baseline visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Systemic therapies (MTX, antimalarials, prednisone, immunosuppressants,&#xD;
                  thalidomide, tetracycline derivatives) must be discontinued at least 4 weeks&#xD;
                  prior to baseline visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        OR if a subject is on such topical or oral medications, the dose has been stable for these&#xD;
        same time intervals and is likely to remain stable for the duration of the study. Patients&#xD;
        whose non-cutaneous disease is being managed by other physicians will continue to have&#xD;
        their care directed by these physicians. The managing physicians will be kept informed of&#xD;
        the patients' status, consistent with study blinding. If the patient's dose of a&#xD;
        concomitant systemic therapy for non-cutaneous sarcoidosis must change by more than 20% of&#xD;
        the dose at study entry due to a change in medical condition during the double-blind phase,&#xD;
        the subject will be discontinued from the study. During the open-label phase the need for a&#xD;
        greater than 20% increase in dose of concomitant treatment for non-cutaneous sarcoidosis&#xD;
        will be viewed as treatment failure and the patient will be discontinued from the study.&#xD;
        Reduction of the dose of such treatment of any magnitude will not result in discontinuance.&#xD;
        Continued use of intralesional therapies is not permitted. Inhaled corticosteroids for a&#xD;
        stable medical condition are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Evidence of other active skin diseases or skin infections during screening that may&#xD;
             interfere with evaluation of sarcoidosis.&#xD;

             recurrent infections, or any other condition for which, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator, participation in the study would place the subject at risk.&#xD;
