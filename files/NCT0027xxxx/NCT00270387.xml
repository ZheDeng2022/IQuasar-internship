  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to compare the clinical effects, safety profile, and&#xD;
      economic impact of standard therapy plus NatrecorÂ® (nesiritide, a recombinant form of the&#xD;
      natural human peptide normally secreted by the heart in response to heart failure) to&#xD;
      standard therapy plus placebo in patients who present to the Emergency Department with&#xD;
      worsening congestive heart failure (CHF) and are treated in the Emergency Department&#xD;
      /Observation Unit.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a public health epidemic in the U.S., affecting almost 5&#xD;
      million Americans. It is associated with a 5-year mortality rate of 50% (according to the&#xD;
      American Heart Association, 1999) and is currently the most costly cardiovascular disease in&#xD;
      the U.S. (according to Rich MW et al 1999 and O'Connell JB 2000). In 1999, the total&#xD;
      estimated direct and indirect costs associated with the treatment of CHF approached $56&#xD;
      billion (according to O'Connell JB 2000). Advanced CHF accounts for over 1 million hospital&#xD;
      admissions annually in the U.S.and for a large portion of the total expense to third-party&#xD;
      payers, due to the high cost of acute inpatient care and related Emergency Department visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emergency Departments are the last line of defense against hospital admission for CHF.&#xD;
      Operational and liability issues that pertain to the typical Emergency Department lead to&#xD;
      hospital admission for most CHF patients. Yet, problems with bed availability may lead to the&#xD;
      delayed transfer of patients from the Emergency Department to the inpatient unit, further&#xD;
      delaying important treatment. To address this, many Emergency Departments have developed&#xD;
      extended-stay policies for the observation and continuing care of patients who cannot be&#xD;
      discharged from the Emergency Department within a few hours of arrival. With an extended stay&#xD;
      (&lt; 24 hours) for evaluation and treatment in the Emergency Department, hospital admission for&#xD;
      CHF may be significantly reduced by adequately ruling out coronary ischemia and aggressively&#xD;
      treating the precipitating factor of the decompensation. This allows physicians to better&#xD;
      assess the appropriateness of admission for the patient (according to Graff LG 1993 ).&#xD;
      Initiation of a safe and effective acute therapy in addition to usual standard care may make&#xD;
      it possible to further reduce hospital admissions or the severity of the patient's condition&#xD;
      at the time of the admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Natrecor® has been approved for use in the treatment of acutely decompensated CHF patients&#xD;
      with dyspnea at rest or with minimal activity. It is a recombinant form (produced by genetic&#xD;
      engineering) of naturally occurring human B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP, also known as&#xD;
      brain natriuretic peptide) produced primarily by the ventricular myocardium (according to&#xD;
      Hosoda K et al 1991). Natrecor® has been well tolerated in controlled clinical trials&#xD;
      involving more than 1000 patients with CHF. The data from these previous studies suggest that&#xD;
      doses of Natrecor® may be a potent agent for the treatment of acute CHF with a unique&#xD;
      combination of desirable effects on the flow of blood throughout the body; the hormones&#xD;
      secreted by the nervous system; and support of copious salt outputs by the renal system not&#xD;
      provided by currently available therapies (according to LeJemtel TH et al 1998). Although&#xD;
      Natrecor® has not been studied in the setting of an Emergency Department, it has been&#xD;
      administered as a fixed-dose infusion without invasive monitoring to over 500 patients.&#xD;
      Furthermore, Natrecor® has not been associated with an increase in cardiac ectopy or&#xD;
      arrhythmias in both placebo-controlled and active-controlled trials (according to Burger AJ&#xD;
      et al 1999 and Mills RM et al 1999).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multicenter, randomized, double-blinded pilot study compares the clinical effects,&#xD;
      safety profile, and economic impact of standard therapy plus Natrecor® to standard therapy&#xD;
      plus placebo in the treatment of acutely decompensated CHF in an Emergency&#xD;
      Department/Observation Unit setting. Study drug (Natrecor® or placebo) is administered as a&#xD;
      bolus of 2 mcg/kg over approximately 60 seconds, immediately followed by a fixed-rate&#xD;
      infusion of 0.01 mcg/kg/min for at least 12 hours. Subjects who continue to receive study&#xD;
      drug and who remain in the Emergency Department/Observation Unit beyond 12 hours, up to 24&#xD;
      hours, have vital signs measured at 18 hours, 24 hours, immediately before discontinuation of&#xD;
      study drug, and at 30 minutes, 1 hour, and 2 hours after discontinuation of study drug. Also,&#xD;
      global clinical and dyspnea (difficulty breathing and shortness of breath) evaluations, and a&#xD;
      visual monitoring scale for dyspnea, are completed at the time of termination of study drug&#xD;
      in the Emergency Department/Observation Unit, or admission to the hospital. The&#xD;
      health-economic analysis focuses on resource utilization and cost of care for initial&#xD;
      treatment in the Emergency Department/Observation Unit and inpatient facility (if admitted),&#xD;
      as well as any subsequent treatment in an Emergency Department or acute inpatient facility&#xD;
      within the 30-day study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesis is that the efficacy and safety profile of Natrecor® may be conducive to&#xD;
      its early administration for acute treatment of heart failure in the Emergency Department and&#xD;
      that in addition to standard care, may make it possible to further reduce hospital admissions&#xD;
      or the severity of the patient's condition at the time of admission. Natrecor® 1.5 mg for&#xD;
      injection made up to final concentration of 0.3 mg/mL with 5% dextrose in water, or placebo.&#xD;
      Dispensed as an intravenous bolus of 2 mcg/kg over approximately 60 seconds, immediately&#xD;
      followed by a fixed-rate infusion of 0.01 mcg/kg/min for at least 12 hours.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history consistent with congestive heart failure (either chronic or&#xD;
             new onset) with fluid overload or elevated cardiac filling pressures by clinical&#xD;
             diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  having a need for observation and intravenous therapy for at least 12 hours, primarily&#xD;
             for the treatment of acutely worsening heart failure&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  having dyspnea (difficulty breathing and shortness of breath) at rest, while supine,&#xD;
             or immediately upon minimal exertion, and evidence of heart failure rather than&#xD;
             pulmonary disease as the primary cause for the dyspnea&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  having jugular venous distension, abdominal discomfort (such as decreased appetite or&#xD;
             nausea) and a weight gain of at least 5 pounds in the previous month&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  having chest x-ray findings indicative of heart failure, or rales (sounds associated&#xD;
             with fluid in the lung cavity) heard on physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients having a clinical status so acutely unstable that invasive monitoring or&#xD;
             mechanical ventilation is required&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  admitted to Emergency Department/Observation Unit primarily for a diagnostic&#xD;
             evaluation (such as ruling out myocardial infarction or to diagnose irregular heart&#xD;
             beats)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  having systolic blood pressure consistently less than 90 mm Hg&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  having cardiogenic shock (a sudden decrease in blood pressure that results in&#xD;
             decreased perfusion of body tissues and organs), volume depletion, or any other&#xD;
             clinical condition that would contraindicate the administration of intravenous&#xD;
             diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or an intravenous agent with potent vasodilating properties&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  having a circumstance recognized at baseline evaluation that would definitely prohibit&#xD;
             discharge to home from the Emergency Department/Observation Unit in less than 24&#xD;
             hours.&#xD;
