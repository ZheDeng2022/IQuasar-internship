      The purpose of this study is to determine the social and economic outcomes of anti-HIV&#xD;
      treatment in South African adults, with data collected from interviews, detailed&#xD;
      questionnaires, and patients' medical records.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The Government of the Republic of South Africa is implementing a national program to provide&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy (ART) to all eligible HIV infected South African adults. While the&#xD;
      medical effectiveness of ART in suppressing viral replication is well established, little is&#xD;
      known about the economic effectiveness of treatment. In particular, it is not known if&#xD;
      treatment will offset the impact of HIV/AIDS on labor productivity, household stability,&#xD;
      quality of life, and other aspects of social and economic development. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to estimate the impact of ART on the productivity, economic welfare, and quality of&#xD;
      life of adult HIV infected patients in South Africa. The study will investigate:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the degree of functional impairment among patients seeking care for HIV/AIDS,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the impact of treatment on the ability of patients to perform normal daily activities&#xD;
           and attend work,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the full economic costs to patients of obtaining treatment,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the impact of treatment on sources of household income,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  social and economic correlates of adherence to therapy, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the cost of delivering ART to different types of patients in diverse settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will last 4 years and will comprise a one-year cross-sectional analysis and a&#xD;
      three-year longitudinal analysis. Data will be collected from questionnaires administered&#xD;
      during patients' routine visits to public and non-governmental organization-based HIV clinics&#xD;
      in South Africa. In accordance with current South African national treatment guidelines,&#xD;
      patients who have started ART will visit a clinic every 3 months during the longitudinal&#xD;
      analysis for a total of 12 visits; patients not yet on ART will visit a clinic every 6 months&#xD;
      for a total of 6 visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaire responses will be matched to indicators of disease progression and treatment&#xD;
      history drawn from patients' medical records. The initial one-year analysis will compare&#xD;
      outcomes for groups of patients stratified by disease stage and treatment duration.&#xD;
      Longitudinal analysis will compare outcomes before and after the initiation of ART; each&#xD;
      participant's responses and medical outcomes will be compared with his or her own previous&#xD;
      results and with those of other participants at a similar stage of disease progression or&#xD;
      treatment duration. This study will generate information needed to sustain large-scale&#xD;
      treatment interventions, improve the focus and management of treatment delivery programs, and&#xD;
      provide a better understanding of barriers to treatment adherence among HIV infected South&#xD;
      African patients.&#xD;
