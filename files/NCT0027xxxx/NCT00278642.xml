    <textblock>
      Autoimmune Bullous Skin Disorders are believed to be due to immune cells, cells that normally&#xD;
      protect the body and are now causing damage to the body. This study is designed to examine&#xD;
      whether treating patients with high dose cyclophosphamide (a drug which reduces the function&#xD;
      of the immune system) together with anti-thymocyte globulin (a protein that kills the immune&#xD;
      cells that are thought to be causing your disease), followed by return of the previously&#xD;
      collected special blood cells (stem cells) will result in improvement of this disease. Stem&#xD;
      cells are undeveloped cells that have the capacity to grow into mature blood cells, which&#xD;
      normally circulate in the blood stream. The purpose of the intense chemotherapy is to destroy&#xD;
      the cells in the immune system which may be causing this skin disease. The purpose of the&#xD;
      stem cell infusion is to restore the body's blood production, which will be severely impaired&#xD;
      by the high dose chemotherapy and anti-thymocyte globulin.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Less than chronologic age 60 years at the time of pre-transplant evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. An established diagnosis of an autoimmune skin disorder that includes any of the&#xD;
             following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. pemphigus vulgaris&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. pemphigus foliaceus&#xD;
&#xD;
             Diagnosis of bullous skin lesions will be based on history and physical, skin biopsy&#xD;
             (light microscopy and indirect fluorescence), indirect immunofluorescence titer, BP&#xD;
             180 and 230 titers, Desmolglein-3 and Desmoglein-1 antibody, and photograph.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients who failed corticosteroids (equivalent dosage of prednisone 0.5 mg/kg/day for&#xD;
             more than 3 months), and at least two of the following: azathioprine, mycophenolate&#xD;
             mofetil, gold, tetracycline (or minocycline), cyclosporin, methotrexate, gold, or&#xD;
             plasmapheresis. Failure is defined as the inability to wean steroids to less than 0.5&#xD;
             mg/kg/day.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Potential candidates must have involvement of more than 10% of skin body surface area,&#xD;
             involvement of one or more mucosal lesions, or recurrent infections requiring more&#xD;
             than two hospitalizations in which the source of the infection was due to bullous skin&#xD;
             disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. All candidates must be evaluated by two dermatologists, Dr. Joan Guitart and Dr.&#xD;
             Joaquin Brieva, who must concur that the patient has refractory disease that may, in&#xD;
             their clinical judgement, be associated with a 5-10% mortality if not controlled.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. A minimum of 2.0 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg after selection are necessary to proceed to&#xD;
             transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Individuals less than 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Significant end organ damage such as:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. LVEF &lt;40% or deterioration of LVEF during exercise test on MUGA or&#xD;
                  echocardiogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Untreated life-threatening arrhythmia.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Active ischemic heart disease or heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. DLCO &lt;45% or FEV1/FEV &lt; 50%.&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Serum creatinine &gt; 2.5 mg/dl.&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. Liver cirrhosis, transaminases &gt;3x of normal limits or bilirubin &gt;2.0 unless due&#xD;
                  to Gilberts disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. HIV positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, or any other illness that in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigators would jeopardize the ability of the patient to tolerate aggressive&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Prior history of malignancy except localized basal cell or squamous skin cancer. Other&#xD;
             malignancies for which the patient is judged to be cured by local surgical therapy,&#xD;
             such as (but not limited to) head and neck cancer, or stage I or II breast cancer will&#xD;
             be considered on an individual basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Positive pregnancy test, inability or unable to pursue effective means of birth&#xD;
             control, or failure to willingly accept or comprehend irreversible sterility as a side&#xD;
             effect of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Psychiatric illness or mental deficiency making compliance with treatment or informed&#xD;
             consent impossible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Inability to give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Major hematological abnormalities such as platelet count less than 100,000/ul, or ANC&#xD;
             less than 1000/ul.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Presence of infected skin lesions. All skin lesions should be free of suppurative&#xD;
             exudate.&#xD;
