  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of standard venous ulcer care to&#xD;
      standard venous ulcer care plus a cell based product made from the patients own blood. This&#xD;
      product, Autologous Platelet Concentrate (APC), is a concentrate of cells in the bloodstream&#xD;
      called platelets.&#xD;

      The purpose of this Pilot clinical study is to make a preliminary clinical and procedural&#xD;
      assessment of the treatment of chronic venous stasis ulcers with Autologous Platelet Gel. The&#xD;
      information and knowledge gained in the Pilot Study will be used to refine the&#xD;
      Investigational Plan under which a Pivotal Clinical Study will be conducted. One of the&#xD;
      advantages of conducting a pilot study is that it might give advance warning about where the&#xD;
      main research project could fail, where research protocols may not or cannot be followed, or&#xD;
      whether proposed methods or instruments are inappropriate or too complicated to achieve the&#xD;
      expected clinical outcomes. The Pilot Study will provide preliminary data with which to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the feasibility of a (full-scale) study/survey&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Refine the clinical protocol procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the likely success of proposed recruitment approaches&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identifying logistical problems which might occur using proposed methods&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estimating variability in outcomes to help determine sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine what resources (finance, staff) are needed for a planned study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the proposed data collection and analysis techniques to uncover potential&#xD;
           problems&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Confirm the study objectives are feasible&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Train researcher in the elements of the research process and protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the magnitude of the difference in the effectiveness of the investigational&#xD;
           treatment vs control treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pilot study will provide supporting clinical data for an IDE application to FDA for&#xD;
      approval to conduct a Pivotal Study of the safety and effectiveness of APG for the treatment&#xD;
      of chronic venous stasis ulcers. The study will evaluate the hypothesis that treatment of a&#xD;
      chronic venous ulcer with APG prepared from Autologous Platelet Concentrate (APC+) (and the&#xD;
      associated autologous growth factors) and Topical Thrombin (TT) has the potential to&#xD;
      accelerate the re-epithelialization process. Harvest Technologies will submit a marketing&#xD;
      application to FDA to expand the labeling of the SmartPReP2® Platelet Concentrate System,&#xD;
      including its accessory kits, with the specific indication to produce APC for the purpose of&#xD;
      promoting healing of chronic venous ulcers of the lower extremity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      60 to 100 study subjects will be enrolled from six investigational sites in this single-phase&#xD;
      clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SmartPReP®2 Platelet Concentrate System is a dedicated microprocessor-controlled&#xD;
      centrifuge. The SmartPReP®2 centrifuge and its accessory, the APC+ Process Kit, are currently&#xD;
      available and used to produce Autologous Platelet Concentrate. The Harvest SmartJet Dual&#xD;
      Applicator Kit is legally marketed to apply autologous blood products (K000456, K011032, and&#xD;
      K020252). Topical Thrombin (TT), (bovine origin), USP is an approved pharmaceutical (NDC&#xD;
      52604-7102-1) marketed by Jones Pharma, Inc. (Thrombin-JMI®) that is not supplied by Harvest&#xD;
      and must be obtained by the practitioner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will compare standard of care medical therapy with and without APC+ and TT.&#xD;
      Therefore, the study ulcers of the Investigational Group will receive treatment with APC+ and&#xD;
      TT as an adjunctive treatment modality in addition to standard therapy.&#xD;
