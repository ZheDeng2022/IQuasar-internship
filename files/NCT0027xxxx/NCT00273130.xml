    <textblock>
      Sixty patients scheduled for upper diagnostic gastroscopy were randomised after written&#xD;
      informed consent into three groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. transnasal gastroscopy with thin endoscope&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. transoral with thin endoscope&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. standard size trans-oral endoscopy Stress response parameters (epinephrine,&#xD;
           nor-epinephrine and cortisol, heartrate variability data and pulse oximetry data were&#xD;
           monitored.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A substantial number of descriptive studies and clinical trials have made it evident that&#xD;
      upper gastrointestinal endoscopy elicits cardiovascular and respiratory changes. Recent&#xD;
      publications have indicated less marked cardiovascular changes when using thinner endoscopes&#xD;
      or transnasal endoscopy .Hormonal stress response during upper gastrointestinal endoscopy has&#xD;
      also been described, but never related to the different methods of upper gastrointestinal&#xD;
      endoscopy. Furthermore the patient tolerance is markedly improved compared to the standard&#xD;
      transoral route.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present randomised study was to evaluate the ECG-, blood pressure- and pulse&#xD;
      rate changes and the endocrine stress response (norepinephrine, epinephrine and cortisol)&#xD;
      elicited by upper gastrointestinal endoscopy using a thin endoscope either transnasally or&#xD;
      orally or a standard endoscope orally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method and material Sixty patients were included consecutively after written and informed&#xD;
      consent and were all over 18 years. Patients receiving digitalis, ÃŸ-blocking agents or&#xD;
      calcium antagonists were excluded, as well as patients receiving drugs for thyroid&#xD;
      dysfunction or patients receiving steroids. Patients with known disease or trauma of the&#xD;
      nasal cavity were not included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only intended diagnostic upper gastrointestinal endoscopies were included. The patients&#xD;
      received standard medication during the endoscopy if required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediately prior to the endoscopy each of the 60 patients chose an envelope with the&#xD;
      allocation to one of three groups A) Endoscopy with a thin endoscope (4.5 mm Olympus&#xD;
      prototype fiberendoscope) introduced transnasally (T group), B) Endoscopy with a thin&#xD;
      endoscope (4.5 mm Olympus prototype fiberendoscope) introduced orally (O group) or C)&#xD;
      Endoscopy with a standard gastroscope (6 mm Olympus GIF XV10) (S group). All patients&#xD;
      received the same amount of a local anesthetic spray (Lidocaine 10 mg/dose, ASTRA Zeneca)&#xD;
      (twice in each nostril and twice in the oropharynx, given by one of two particular persons to&#xD;
      ensure application of comparable doses of local anesthetic).&#xD;
