  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a newly developed educational software&#xD;
      program is effective in increasing patients' confidence in their ability to undergo colon&#xD;
      cancer screening. If the software is effective in this regard, the study will also determine&#xD;
      if increased confidence to undergo screening leads to more people being screened and to&#xD;
      people feeling as though their decision about screening was informed.&#xD;

      Background: Interactive multimedia computer programs (IMCPs) show promise for facilitating&#xD;
      informed patient decisions. However, it is unclear whether IMCPs can activate patients by&#xD;
      delivering personally tailored information to bolster self-efficacy, a key mediator of health&#xD;
      behavior. It is also unclear whether IMCPs might be employed to lessen disparities in care&#xD;
      experienced by less educated people by tailoring self-efficacy enhancing information to&#xD;
      educational level and compensating for provider biases in communication. Finally, the optimal&#xD;
      way to deploy IMPCs in primary care (e.g. before versus following an office visit) remains&#xD;
      unclear. Aims/Hypotheses: We will compare changes in colorectal cancer (CRC) screening&#xD;
      self-efficacy, intention, uptake, and informed decision making resulting from an IMCP&#xD;
      providing personally tailored information (to subject educational level and self-efficacy)&#xD;
      intended to boost self-efficacy with changes resulting from a non-tailored control IMCP. We&#xD;
      hypothesize both the intervention and control condition will result in increases in CRC&#xD;
      screening self-efficacy, but increases will be significantly greater in the intervention&#xD;
      group. We also hypothesize both the intervention and control condition will increase CRC&#xD;
      screening intention, uptake, and informed decision making, but increases will be greater in&#xD;
      the intervention group and will be mediated by self-efficacy enhancement. Methods: Pilot&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) of 2 groups, comparing a PCN office visit-linked, tailored&#xD;
      (to subject self-efficacy) IMCP software program plus mailed reminders versus a non-tailored&#xD;
      CRC screening IMCP software program plus mailed reminders (control). Screening methods&#xD;
      targeted will be fecal occult blood testing, flexible sigmoidoscopy, colonoscopy, and&#xD;
      computed tomographic virtual colonoscopy. Primary outcomes will be CRC screening&#xD;
      self-efficacy, intention, uptake, and informed decision making. Implications: Our pilot is&#xD;
      powered to detect a significant effect on CRC screening self-efficacy but not other outcomes;&#xD;
      however, by conducting it as we would a future and larger RCT, we will determine protocol&#xD;
      feasibility. If our hypotheses are confirmed, it would imply cancer screening IMCPs should be&#xD;
      focused on enhancing self-efficacy. Since self-efficacy is a mediator of many patient and&#xD;
      health care provider behaviors, it would also imply that similar IMCPs could be developed to&#xD;
      support a host of patient and professional education efforts.&#xD;
