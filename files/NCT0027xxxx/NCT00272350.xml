    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In vivo experiments have documented the ability of ZD6474 to inhibit tumor growth in various&#xD;
      preclinical tumor models. Given the pronounced neovasculature associated with malignant&#xD;
      gliomas, and abundant published data demonstrating the dependence of glioma growth on the&#xD;
      maintenance and proliferation of this neovasculature, ZD6474 represents a potentially&#xD;
      promising new therapeutic approach to these otherwise refractory tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, we now propose a phase I trial of ZD6474 in patients with recurrent and progressive&#xD;
      low-grade gliomas who are on P450-inducing anti-epileptic drugs and a phase II trial for&#xD;
      patients with recurrent gliomas not taking P450-inducing anti-epileptic drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I - To establish the maximally tolerated dose of ZD6474 and to obtain preliminary&#xD;
      information regarding the spectrum of toxicities of ZD6474, and to obtain pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      data to patients taking EIAED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I - To obtain preliminary information regarding potential anti-tumor activity of ZD6474&#xD;
      in patients taking EIAED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II - To establish data regarding the anti-tumor activity of ZD6474 and to collect&#xD;
      information regarding the spectrum of toxicities in patients not taking EIAEDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with histologically proven malignant primary gliomas will be eligible for this&#xD;
      protocol. Additionally, patients with progressive low-grade gliomas and patients with&#xD;
      infiltrative brain stem gliomas, diagnosed radiographically rather than by biopsy will also&#xD;
      be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I - Group B patients will be accrued to the formal dose-escalation phase I trial.&#xD;
      Groups of patients with recurrent high-grade gliomas will be accrued to increasingly higher&#xD;
      doses of ZD6474 until the MTD is established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II - Patients will be treated at a dose of 300 mg day, every day, on a 4-week cycle.&#xD;

&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA PHASE I:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any of the following is regarded as a criterion for exclusion from the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who, in the view of the treating physician, have significant active hepatic,&#xD;
        renal, or psychiatric diseases are ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Active cardiac disease as defined by:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant cardiac event (including symptomatic heart failure or evidence of cardiac&#xD;
             ischemia within 3 months of first dose or presence of any cardiac disease that in the&#xD;
             opinion of the Investigator increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant arrhythmia (multifocal premature ventricular contraction [PVC],&#xD;
             bigeminy, trigeminy, ventricular tachycardia, bradycardia) that is symptomatic or&#xD;
             requires treatment (CTCAE v3.0 grade 3), or asymptomatic sustained ventricular&#xD;
             tachycardia, at the discretion of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any concurrent medication that may cause QTc prolongation or induce Torsades de&#xD;
             Pointes (See Appendix C, Table 1). Drugs listed in Appendix C, Table 2, that in the&#xD;
             investigator s opinion cannot be discontinued are allowed; however, must be monitored&#xD;
             closely with additional ECGs and laboratory assessments of electrolytes to ensure the&#xD;
             patient s safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous history of QTc prolongation with other medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Congenital long QT syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  QTc with Bazett's correction that is unmeasurable, or greater than or equal to 460&#xD;
             msec on screening ECG. If a patient has QTc greater than or equal to 460 msec on&#xD;

             average QTc from the 2 screening ECGs must be less than 460 msec in order for the&#xD;
             patient to be eligible for the study. If the patient meets eligibility requirements in&#xD;
             this way, the &quot;baseline&quot; QTc for this patient will be the average of the 3 ECGs&#xD;
             (screen 1, screen 2, and pre-1st dose).&#xD;
&#xD;

             measured by multi-gated acquisition scan (MUGA) or by echocardiogram (ECHO) for&#xD;
             patients with previous anthracycline therapy (total dose greater than 450 mg/m(2)) or&#xD;
             significant cardiovascular disease or chest irradiation, as determined by the&#xD;
             investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A cardiac arrhythmia serious enough to require therapy (i.e. drugs, AID), angina,&#xD;
             symptomatic congestive heart failure and/or a cardiac ejection fraction less than 45&#xD;
             percent.&#xD;

        Prior serious cardiac disease defined as prior coronary bypass surgery, angioplasty, or&#xD;
        prior myocardial infarction unless a recent cardiac evaluation (within the last 3 months)&#xD;
        demonstrated no significant coronary artery disease (i.e. a negative stress test) and no&#xD;
        myocardial wall dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Concurrent use of other standard chemotherapeutics or investigative agents or&#xD;
        vasoconstrictors for the treatment of migraine (ergotamine, zolmitriptan, sumatriptan)&#xD;
        because of the potential for exacerbation of coronary vasoconstriction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Laboratory results sustained at:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Neutrophils less than 1.5 10(9)/L or platelets less than 100,000/mm(3). Serum creatinine&#xD;
        greater than 1.5 x ULRR. Potassium, calcium (ionized calcium or adjusted for albumin), or&#xD;

        permitted. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST/SGOT) greater than 2 times ULRR, or AST greater&#xD;
        than 5.0 ULRR if judged by the investigator to be related to liver metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic disease or any concurrent condition which in&#xD;
        the Investigator's opinion makes it undesirable for the patient to participate in the trial&#xD;
        or which would jeopardize compliance with the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Hypertension not controlled by medical therapy (systolic blood pressure greater than 160 mm&#xD;
        Hg or diastolic blood pressure greater than 100 mm Hg).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any currently active gastrointestinal disease with diarrhea that may affect the ability of&#xD;
        the patient to absorb the ZD6474 or tolerate diarrhea.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Currently pregnant or breast feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participation in a clinical trial of any investigational agents within 14 days prior to&#xD;
        commencing study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must be at least six weeks from radiation therapy. Additionally, patients must be&#xD;
        at least 6 weeks from nitrosoureas, 4 weeks from temozolomide or carboplatin, 3 weeks from&#xD;
