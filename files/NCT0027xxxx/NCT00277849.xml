    <textblock>
      This study will collect blood samples for use in laboratory studies of malaria. The World&#xD;
      Health Organization reports that 40 percent of the world's population is at risk for malaria,&#xD;
      mostly in the poorest countries. It is a serious disease caused by parasites. Each year,&#xD;
      300-500 million infections lead to more than a million deaths. However, there are traits in&#xD;
      red blood cells (erythrocyte) that protect people against malaria. In this study,&#xD;
      polymorphism refers to the various kinds of red blood cell traits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sickle cell trait is an example of one that seems to offer a natural survival advantage&#xD;
      in children where malaria is common. Researchers at the Laboratory of Malaria and Vector&#xD;
      Research are investigating ways in which the blood cell traits can offer such protection, and&#xD;
      new knowledge gained can bring about medical advances. Of particular importance is studying&#xD;
      how the malaria organism, Plasmodium, survives inside different red blood cells. A steady,&#xD;
      consistent, and reliable supply of fresh whole blood is necessary for testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 to 65, weighing more than 110 lbs. and who do not have anemia or known HIV,&#xD;
      Hepatitis C, or Hepatitis B may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo a medical history and general assessment including vital signs of&#xD;
      temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure. Blood will be collected from a vein in the arm,&#xD;
      or rarely a vein in the hand. A complete blood count, or CBC, will be done to ensure that&#xD;
      blood levels are sufficient and that blood donation is safe for a patient to do. Patients&#xD;
      need to have enough hemoglobin, the part of red blood cells that transports oxygen throughout&#xD;
      the body. The blood will also be tested to confirm the type of red blood cell traits of&#xD;
      patients. About 1 to 8 tablespoons may be collected, but most blood samples will be small,&#xD;
      that is, 1 to 4 teaspoons. After the patients' first visit, sessions will take 5-20 minutes.&#xD;
      Blood collection will total no more than 2 cups from a donor during any 6-week period.&#xD;
      Although the frequency of blood donations is not known at this time, it is unlikely that a&#xD;
      patient will be asked to donate blood more than four times a year. It may be important for&#xD;
      patients to undergo a repeat CBC or tests for blood chemistry if results are needed for&#xD;
      research. Risks associated with blood collection are considered minimal. They include&#xD;
      discomfort, occasional bruising or bleeding at the puncture site, and faintness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, it is possible that a small amount of blood may be stored for future research,&#xD;
      to help the researchers to learn more about malaria. There are no plans for the results from&#xD;
      the various research laboratory tests to be made available to patients or to their private&#xD;
      doctors. However, patients in this study may discuss the results of routine medical tests&#xD;
      with the study investigators. Some of the blood collected will be tested for genetic&#xD;
      conditions. Through genetic testing, researchers can learn more about how health or illness&#xD;
      may be passed on to people by their parents, or from people to their children. All results of&#xD;
      tests will remain confidential. Blood samples will be labeled by code, and reference to&#xD;
      patients' identities will be protected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive $50 for each blood donation. This study will not have a direct&#xD;
      benefit for participants. Future research that uses their blood samples will help researchers&#xD;
      to learn about malaria as well as how to prevent or treat the disease.&#xD;

      This protocol is designed to provide a mechanism for investigators in the Laboratory of&#xD;
      Malaria and Vector Research (LMVR) to collect and process peripheral blood samples from&#xD;
      volunteer donors. Donors who meet standard eligibility criteria will be recruited to donate&#xD;
      blood via standard phlebotomy techniques at the NIH Clinical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The LMVR has ongoing in vitro studies to characterize the effects of hemoglobin mutations and&#xD;
      erythrocyte polymorphisms on the pathogenesis of Plasmodium falciparum, the agent of the most&#xD;
      deadly malaria in humans. G6PD deficiency, hemoglobinopathies such as HbS, HbC, and HbE, and&#xD;
      the thalassemias are thought to have evolved as protective traits against malaria in endemic&#xD;
      areas of the world. However, the mechanisms by which these mutations exert their protective&#xD;
      influence are largely unknown. Culturing P. falciparum in erythrocytes carrying protective&#xD;
      traits will allow researchers in LMVR to characterize the cellular and molecular bases of&#xD;
      protection using in vitro methods such as growth analyses and electron microscopy. To this&#xD;
      effect, patients with known or suspected erythrocyte variants will be recruited in addition&#xD;
      to normal controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Signed informed consent will be obtained by an authorized investigator. The nature of the&#xD;
      study as well as the risks and benefits of the donation process will be explained to each&#xD;
      participant. Donors will be compensated for each blood donation or for unsuccessful attempts&#xD;
      at venipuncture. Samples will be used solely for in vitro research. To ensure&#xD;
      confidentiality, blood will be assigned a unique code; investigators listed on this protocol&#xD;
      will serve as the custodians of the codes that link the samples to the donors' identities.&#xD;
