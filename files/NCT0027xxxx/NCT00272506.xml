      To evaluate current and novel therapies and management strategies for children with asthma.&#xD;
      The emphasis is on clinical trials that help identify optimal therapy for children with&#xD;
      different asthma phenotypes, genotypes, and ethnic backgrounds and children at different&#xD;
      developmental stages.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Asthma is a complex disease that often starts early in life. Exacerbations can be triggered&#xD;
      by a number of agents such as allergens, respiratory infections, environmental tobacco smoke&#xD;
      and pollutants, drugs, chemicals, exercise, cold air, infections and strong emotion making&#xD;
      asthma therapy difficult and sometimes complicated. Multiple medications are often required&#xD;
      to treat symptoms (bronchodilator agents such as beta-2 adrenergic agonists, theophylline,&#xD;
      and anticholinergics), as well the underlying disease process (anti-inflammatory agents such&#xD;
      as inhaled and systemic corticosteroids, cromolyn sodium and nedocromil; and leukotriene&#xD;
      modifiers).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalence of asthma is increasing in all age groups, but most particularly in children&#xD;
      under the age of 18 years. In 1992, the prevalence of self-reported asthma among persons&#xD;
      under 18 years of age was 7.2 percent, compared to 5.1 percent among all persons. The most&#xD;
      rapid increase in asthma has occurred in children under 5 years old, with rates increasing&#xD;
      over 160 percent over the past 15 years. Among all ages, over 450,000 hospitalizations, 5,000&#xD;
      deaths, and more than 100 million days of restricted activity are due to asthma every year.&#xD;
      Yet the burden of asthma disproportionately affects children. For example, asthma&#xD;
      hospitalization rates are highest among persons age 0-4 years, and have increased over 28&#xD;
      percent in the last 15 years; mortality rates increased faster among those aged 5 to-12 years&#xD;
      than among those age 15-34 years and neither changes in disease coding nor improved&#xD;
      recognition of asthma fully explain these increases. Nearly one third of children restrict&#xD;
      their activities due to asthma, including participation in physical education and sports.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite major advances in understanding the etiology and pathophysiology of asthma and the&#xD;
      development of new therapeutic modalities to control symptoms and prevent exacerbations,&#xD;
      effective therapies are not widely used in the pediatric health care community. Further, the&#xD;
      long term effects and side effects of asthma medications in children, especially children&#xD;
      under the age of 12 years, are not well understood. Much remains to be learned about the&#xD;
      impact of asthma therapy at different ages and at different points in the natural history of&#xD;
      the asthma in altering the progression, chronicity, or severity of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is an urgent need to rapidly evaluate new and existing therapeutic approaches for&#xD;
      children with asthma, and to disseminate the findings to health care professionals, patients&#xD;
      and the public. There are several reasons why a pediatric asthma clinical research network&#xD;
      will accelerate clinical research and meet this need. The highly variable and sometimes&#xD;
      complicated clinical manifestations of asthma often make it difficult to accumulate a large&#xD;
      number of comparable patients in one center. Further, uniformity in treatment protocols may&#xD;
      reduce the number of patients needed at each clinical center. Also, the network mechanism&#xD;
      will help pool the necessary clinical expertise and administrative resources to facilitate&#xD;
      the conduct of multiple and novel therapeutic trials in a timely, efficient manner. This, in&#xD;
      turn, would promote rapid dissemination of research findings to health care professionals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pediatric Asthma Controller Trial (PACT) is a study to determine the comparative&#xD;
      effectiveness of inhaled corticosteroid, a leukotriene receptor antagonist, or a combination&#xD;
      medication of inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting beta2-agonist in children with mild&#xD;
      asthma. The study addresses a critical question facing primary care physicians about the&#xD;
      optimal choice for initiating daily long-term treatment in children. The primary study&#xD;
      outcome is the percentage of days without asthma during the 12-month treatment period.&#xD;
      Recruitment began in August, 2002. A total of 300 children were assigned to one of three&#xD;
      active treatment arms for 12 months: active ICS; a combination of active ICS and salmeterol;&#xD;
      or active montelukast (LTRA). Major outcomes on the follow-up of 277 children were presented&#xD;
      in May, 2005 at the American Thoracic Society meeting.&#xD;
