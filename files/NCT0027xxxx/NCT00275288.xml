      MRI Study for females ages 18-45 with Borderline Personality Disorder(BPD): This study is a&#xD;
      non-treatment study that involves 2 visits. Study Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To refine and pilot test functional neuroimaging paradigms to assess the amygdala&#xD;
           response to neutral facial expressions across positive and negative emotional contexts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess whether patients with borderline personality disorder show a heightened&#xD;
           amygdala response to neutral facial expressions relative to healthy controls (20 female&#xD;
           healthy controls, 20 females with borderline personality disorder).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess the relationship between individual differences in clinical ratings of&#xD;
           personality and affective regulation, and the amygdala response to facial expressions.&#xD;

      The first visit will be an interview assessment and will take place at the Ambulatory&#xD;
      Research Center (ARC), Fairview University-Riverside Campus. In addition to the interview&#xD;
      assessment, we will ask you to complete a set of questionnaires about your behavior and mood.&#xD;
      This first visit will last approximately 2.5-3 hours. Following the interview assessment, if&#xD;
      you are eligible for the MRI study we will contact you to schedule an MRI scan on a separate&#xD;
      visit. This visit will last approximately 2 hours. At this visit you will have an MRI scan of&#xD;
      your brain. Prior to the MRI scan, you will have a practice session in an MRI simulator.&#xD;

        20 Female subjects ages 18-45 whom meet criteria for BPD will be included in the study. 20&#xD;
        healthy controls will also be females between the ages 18-45.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Female subjects ages 18-45 whom meet criteria for BPD will be included in the study. The&#xD;
        healthy controls will also be females between the ages 18-45. The healthy controls will&#xD;
        undergo the same diagnostic and symptom evaluations as the female patients - these&#xD;
        interview schedules will be used mainly for determining exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Neither borderline personality disorder subjects or healthy controls may have a&#xD;
             history of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar illness, major depression&#xD;
             with psychotic features, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), Post-Traumatic Stress&#xD;
             Disorder (PTSD), or Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients and healthy controls may not have a serious neurologic or other metabolic&#xD;
             disorder or any medical condition or treatment known to affect the parameters of this&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Neither patients nor healthy controls will be included in the study if they are&#xD;
             receiving a medical treatment that requires a medication that may have psychotropic&#xD;
             effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Neither patients nor healthy controls can have any contraindications to MRI scanning&#xD;
             such as a metal implant, a pacemaker, or a history of claustrophobia. At the Center&#xD;
             for Magnetic Resonance Research (CMRR), we have developed a highly specific and&#xD;
             detailed questionnaire to ensure the safety of all participants. This questionnaire is&#xD;
             administered prior to any and all scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Pregnant women will be excluded from the study. This will be assessed by history, date&#xD;
             of last menstrual period and urine pregnancy test if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Neither patients nor healthy controls who fulfill criteria for developmental&#xD;
             deficiency will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Healthy controls with more than two borderline personality disorder criteria will not&#xD;
             be eligible for study. This is to reduce the possibility of healthy controls being&#xD;
             &quot;near misses&quot; to the patients and diminishing the possibility of finding difference&#xD;
             between the patients and the healthy controls.&#xD;
