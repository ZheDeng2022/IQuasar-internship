  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parathyroid hormone (PTH) has potent bone-building actions and has been approved for the&#xD;
      treatment of osteoporosis as FORTEO by Eli Lilly &amp; Co. Numerous studies have verified its&#xD;
      effectiveness in increasing bone mass and potential for PTH to positively impact oral bone.&#xD;
      The hypothesis of this study is that patients administered FORTEO along with periodontal&#xD;
      (gum) surgery will respond more favorably than patients who receive placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be 40 subjects enrolled in this study. All subjects will receive surgical&#xD;
      treatment. 20 subjects will receive FORTEO and 20 will receive placebo. Subjects will be&#xD;
      assigned to study group randomly. Neither the subjects nor the clinicians will know whether&#xD;
      the subject is receiving FORTEO or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo routine periodontal treatment procedures including periodontal surgery.&#xD;
      Starting from 3 days prior to surgery, all subjects will self-administer FORTEO or placebo&#xD;
      for 6 weeks. Subjects will be trained for self-administration, a procedure similar to&#xD;
      diabetic injections. Patients will also take Vitamin D and Calcium by mouth during this time.&#xD;
      Study outcomes will be measured by blood collection; oral fluid sampling; oral x-ray and&#xD;
      spine and hip bone density scan; routine periodontal examinations; and an oral health quality&#xD;
      of life questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients of both genders and all ethnicities from age 30-75 years will be included in the&#xD;
      study. All ethnicities are eligible for entry into study. No vulnerable populations will be&#xD;
      included. Pregnant/breast-feeding women and women of childbearing potential on no&#xD;
      contraception will be excluded from the study. Research records will not be linkable to the&#xD;
      research subjects. Subjects will be randomly assigned to treatment arms and identified by&#xD;
      initials and numbers. Informed consent forms will be used to obtain consent for participation&#xD;
      in the study from all subjects prior to enrollment. The Principal Investigator or&#xD;
      Co-Investigator will explain the details of study involvement and give subjects ample&#xD;
      opportunity to ask questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is anticipated that patients on FORTEO will have greater regeneration with periodontal&#xD;
      therapy as compared to control patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parathyroid hormone is an endogenous hormone with potent anabolic and catabolic actions in&#xD;
      bone. It has recently been approved for the treatment of osteoporosis and is marketed as&#xD;
      FORTEO by Eli Lilly and Company. Numerous studies in humans have validated its use to&#xD;
      increase bone mineral density and prevent fractures. Interest has also surfaced in its&#xD;
      potential application in the treatment of non-osteoporotic fractures and several animal&#xD;
      studies have supported this local application. Little is known regarding its use in treating&#xD;
      conditions of the oral cavity, but animal studies suggest that bones of the oral cavity are&#xD;
      responsive to the anabolic actions of PTH. Furthermore, a recent study indicated that in a&#xD;
      canine model, PTH was effective at reversing periodontal bone loss. Studies from our&#xD;
      laboratory indicate that patients with hyperparathyroidism (HPT) do not have an increase in&#xD;
      periodontal disease as measured by attachment levels. In fact, in our patient population&#xD;
      there was an increase in osseous activity in patients with HPT in the form of tori and&#xD;
      exostoses (bony protuberances in the oral cavity). This suggests that increased circulating&#xD;
      levels of PTH do not adversely impact the oral cavity. Furthermore, in a wound healing animal&#xD;
      model of bone regeneration, we found that regenerating intramembranous bone was more&#xD;
      responsive to anabolic actions of PTH than endogenous bone of the vertebrae. These studies&#xD;
      highlight the potential for PTH to positively impact osseous healing in the oral cavity in&#xD;
      response to periodontal therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be double blinded, and patients will be randomized into one of two treatment&#xD;
      groups (FORTEO or placebo once/daily). Patients will self-administer drug on a QD schedule,&#xD;
      and take Vitamin D and Calcium, PO, QD, for six weeks. Drug administration will begin three&#xD;
      days prior to periodontal surgery. Subjects will be followed at post-op, week 3, week 6,&#xD;
      month 3, month 6, month 9, and month 12 visits. Clinical effects will be measured by serum&#xD;
      collection, gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) sampling, standard dental radiographs, oral exam&#xD;
      including perio probing, oral health quality of life questionnaire, and DEXA scans.&#xD;
