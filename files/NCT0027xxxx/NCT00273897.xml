      This study will test whether DC electrical polarization of the brain can temporarily improve&#xD;
      hand function in patients with corticobasal syndrome (CBS). In this degenerative disorder of&#xD;
      the brain, nerve cells die over time, causing a progressive decline in the patient's ability&#xD;
      to use their hands. This is always worse on one side. Other symptoms include arm or leg&#xD;
      stiffness, tremor, gait unsteadiness, and speech difficulty. Some patients also have some&#xD;
      decline in thinking ability, such as loss of skilled activities, poor problem solving&#xD;
      abilities poor concentration, problems with language, and forgetfulness,. DC electrical&#xD;
      polarization of the brain involves placing sponge electrodes on the head and passing a very&#xD;
      weak current between them. DC polarization can temporarily improve the ability of healthy&#xD;
      people to make word lists and may improve symptoms in some brain diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 40 and older with CBS who have participated in NINDS protocol 02-N-0001 (&quot;Testing a&#xD;
      Model of the Representational Knowledge Stored in the Human Prefrontal Cortex&quot;) may be&#xD;
      eligible for this study. In protocol 02-N-0001, participants provide a medical history,&#xD;
      undergo a neurological examination, PET scanning and MRI, and complete tests, such as sitting&#xD;
      in front of a computer monitor and press a key to indicate a decision about what appears on&#xD;
      the screen (for example, whether a statement is accurate) and answering questions from a test&#xD;
      examiner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the current protocol, participants have three 2-hour testing sessions at the NIH Clinical&#xD;
      Center, scheduled at least one day apart. In each session, sponge electrodes are placed on&#xD;
      the head so that they affect different areas of the brain. Two areas are involved with hand&#xD;
      movement; the third does not. The electrodes are dampened with water and attached to the&#xD;
      sides of the patient's head. When the current is turned on, the patient may feel some&#xD;
      tingling. The current is on for 40 minutes, but can be reduced or stopped early if the&#xD;
      tingling becomes uncomfortable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before and during each session, the patients' hand function is tested by having them perform&#xD;
      and imitate some actions, insert pegs into holes on a board, and tap their index finger as&#xD;
      fast as they can. Part or all of the sessions are videotaped for use in evaluating the&#xD;
      effects of DC polarization.&#xD;

      Objective: In a recent sham-controlled pilot study, we showed that surface anodal direct&#xD;
      current (DC) polarization can improve verbal fluency in frontotemporal dementia patients.&#xD;
      Corticobasilar syndrome is a related disorder that presents with disordered limb movement,&#xD;
      particularly the loss of stored motor programs, (ideational/ideomotor apraxia) and impaired&#xD;
      hand function. Conventional neurorehabilitation is typically unsuccessful in this disorder.&#xD;
      We wish to see whether anodal polarization of the inferior parietal cortex (IPC) in CBS&#xD;
      patients leads to improved movement and whether the improvement is specifically in the&#xD;
      generation of stored movements (praxis). We will also apply polarization to the primary&#xD;
      sensorimotor area (SM1), where we expect any effects to be on elemental aspects of movement,&#xD;
      such as finger tapping speed. Study population: Twenty CBS patients will be enrolled. Design:&#xD;
      This single blind crossover study will have three arms: anodal DC to IPC, anodal DC to SM1,&#xD;
      and a control condition: polarization with the electrodes placed on the right and left&#xD;
      occipital areas. Outcome Measures: The primary outcome measure is a validated test of&#xD;
      ideational and ideomotor apraxia. Secondary outcomes are measures of hand dexterity and&#xD;
      coordination.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically diagnosed CBS, consisting of progressive asymmetric rigidity and apraxia&#xD;
             and additional findings suggesting cortical (e.g., one or more of the following: alien&#xD;
             limb phenomenon, apraxia of speech, cortical sensory loss, constructional dyspraxia,&#xD;
             hemisensory neglect, myoclonus, mirror movements) and basal ganglionic (e.g., one or&#xD;
             more of the following: bradykinesia, dystonia, tremor, postural instability)&#xD;
             dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients fitting these criteria will be identified among those referred to protocol&#xD;
             02-N-0001. All must have been evaluated under this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Enough residual hand function on one side to perform the tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age greater than or equal to 40: This limit is justified because the diagnosis of CBS&#xD;
             would be very uncertain in anyone under this age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of metal in the cranial cavity or calvarium.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled medical problems, such as uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, hypertension,&#xD;
             airway disease, heart failure, coronary artery disease, or any other condition that&#xD;
             poses a risk for participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Broken skin in the area of the electrodes.&#xD;
