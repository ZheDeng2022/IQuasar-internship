      Does a new colonoscopic viewing technique called narrow band imaging (NBI) help doctors&#xD;
      detect more patients with at least one pre-cancerous polyp (adenoma) than conventional&#xD;
      colonoscopy using white light alone?&#xD;
&#xD;

      allow assessment of inter- and intra-observer variability.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer is the second commonest cause of cancer death. In a majority of cases it is&#xD;
      preceded by a precancerous lesion called an adenoma (polyp). Detection and removal of&#xD;
      adenomas at colonoscopy has been shown to reduce the death rate from colorectal cancer.&#xD;
      However, despite meticulous examination there is a &quot;miss rate&quot; for adenomas at colonoscopy&#xD;
      which ranges from 66-25% in back-to-back colonoscopy studies. The nature of the polyps which&#xD;
      as well as being pedunculated (cherry like) can be flat or depressed making them difficult to&#xD;
      see, which may contribute to the &quot;miss rate&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The factors, which influence the endoscopist detection are not well studied. Polyp detection&#xD;
      rates wary widely, even among experts. Techniques that highlight lesions have advanced in&#xD;
      recent years. Chromoendoscopy, the current gold standard technique, relies on spraying dye on&#xD;
      the bowel lining, has been shown to help pick up more pre-cancerous polyps in two of three&#xD;
      studies; however it is not widely used as it is time consuming and requires extra equipment&#xD;
      and training. Narrow band imaging (NBI) is a technique that relies in light filters to&#xD;
      improve contrast for the smallest blood vessels in the bowel lining which shows up adenomas&#xD;
      as they have a richer vascular network. It is sometimes described as &quot;digital&#xD;
      chromoendoscopy&quot; as the images produced are similar to chromoendoscopy, but it is much&#xD;
      simpler and quicker to use. Autofluorescence endoscopy uses short wavelength light and light&#xD;
      filters to produce a false colour image of the bowel lining where polyps stand out. These&#xD;
      techniques have been used with some success in the oesophagus and stomach but little work is&#xD;
      available for the colon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to see if NBI is better than standard colonoscopy for detecting precancerous polyps.&#xD;
      This is likely as it is similar to chromoendoscopy which is already shown to help. If a polyp&#xD;
      is found we will use other types of endoscopy, particularly NBI with magnification and&#xD;
      autofluorescence to see if these techniques are helpful for discriminating between&#xD;
      pre-cancerous and non pre-cancerous polyps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      May 2007 protocol minor amendment: additional viewing by endoscopists outside St Mark's ro&#xD;
      allow assessment of inter- and intra-observer variability. No additional data collected.&#xD;
