      The objective of the study is to determine the effect on lung function when either SPIRIVA&#xD;
      once daily or placebo once daily is added to the usual therapy (care) of COPD patients naïve&#xD;
      to anticholinergic agents managed in primary care. Previous studies have been in both&#xD;
      hospital in and outpatients, with washout of some respiratory medications, this is the first&#xD;
      study to be conducted in General Practice, the drug's anticipated environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from this study, including the adverse event monitoring, and post study findings on&#xD;
      physical examination, will be used to extend the safety database. Health Resource Utilisation&#xD;
      (HRU) data will be recorded to be use with data from other sources for economic analysis of&#xD;
      COPD treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anticholinergic drugs are currently indicated for all severities of COPD, due to the&#xD;
      dominance of cholinergic tone in the pathological process of the disease. SPIRIVA is a new&#xD;
      long acting anticholinergic, which has showed the benefits of improved lung function,&#xD;
      dyspnoea, health status and less exacerbations compared to ipratropium, salmeterol and&#xD;
      placebo in secondary care (hospital setting). The study will determine if the same effect is&#xD;
      seen on the on lung function and dyspnoea when either SPIRIVA or placebo is added to the&#xD;
      usual therapy /care of COPD patients naïve to anticholinergic agents managed in primary care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The one year placebo and active controlled studies have confirmed efficacy and safety. No&#xD;
      evidence of tolerance to the bronchodilator effects of tiotropium has been seen. Consistent&#xD;
      improvements of health outcomes were also demonstrated. In the one-year studies,&#xD;
      statistically significantly fewer patients in the tiotropium groups experienced&#xD;
      exacerbations, or were hospitalised for exacerbations. Additionally, time to first&#xD;
      exacerbation was increased. This suggests that moderate and severe exacerbations are reduced&#xD;
      in-patients treated with tiotropium. The mechanism underlying this is not known, but may be&#xD;
      associated with sustained airway opening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will involve five visits to the GP surgery over a period of 14 weeks. Patient will&#xD;
      attend for an initial visit to have the study information given to them and obtain their&#xD;
      written consent. At the subsequent screening visit a physical examination including ECG&#xD;
      together with an assessment of lung function will be performed. Once eligibility to the study&#xD;
      is confirmed, and after completion of a 14 day 'run-in' period, patients will start treatment&#xD;
      with a daily inhalation from the HandiHaler device of either SPIRIVA or placebo, this in&#xD;
      addition to their usual COPD therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout the 12 week treatment period, patients will be required to inhale their study&#xD;
      treatment medication (each morning) and complete a diary card. Patients will be required to&#xD;
      return to the surgery after 2 and 6 weeks, with the final visit at 12 weeks for lung function&#xD;
      testing, assessment of symptoms using the Oxygen Cost Diagram (OCD), Health Resources&#xD;
      Utilisation (HRU) and any adverse events. On completion of the 12 week treatment period, a&#xD;
      full physical examination will be repeated. Adverse event monitoring including COPD&#xD;
      exacerbations will take place throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on previous studies on COPD patients who were not on long acting beta agonists (LABAs),&#xD;
      the standard deviation (SD) for trough FEV1 was 215 ml and an effect of 130 ml was seen on&#xD;
      mean trough FEV1 with tiotropium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is assumed that 20% of primary care managed COPD patients will be using LABAs as part of&#xD;
      their usual care. The effect of tiotropium on mean trough FEV1 in the study population is&#xD;
      expected to be lower than the 130 ml seen in previous studies. Placebo is not expected to&#xD;
      have any effect on mean trough FEV1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assuming an SD of 235ml, a total of 348 patients (174 per group) is adequate to detect a&#xD;
      difference of 100 ml in mean trough FEV1 response between treatments with at the least 95%&#xD;
      power at the 2.5% level of significance (one-sided) using a two group t-test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To be considered complete, a patient must complete all primary efficacy data for all study&#xD;
      visits as specified in the protocol without violations of the protocol so significant as to&#xD;
      obscure the response to treatment.&#xD;
