  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test whether certain patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), acute&#xD;
      myeloid leukemia (AML) or chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) can safely be vaccinated with two&#xD;
      peptide vaccines derived from proteins called proteinase 3 (PR1) and Wilm's tumor-1 (WT1).&#xD;
      These proteins are produced in large amounts by cells of MDS, AML and CML patients. The&#xD;
      peptides are combined with an &quot;adjuvant&quot; called Montanide to make the vaccines, and the&#xD;
      vaccines are given with GM-CSF (sargramostim). Both Montanide and sargramostim help the&#xD;
      immune system respond to the vaccines. The vaccines then activate the immune system to make&#xD;
      specialized cells that search out and kill the MDS, AML and CML cells containing the two&#xD;
      proteins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with MDS, AML or CML who are 18 years of age or older may be eligible for this&#xD;
      study. Candidates are screened with a medical history and physical examination, blood tests,&#xD;
      chest x-ray, and bone marrow aspirate and biopsy. For the bone marrow biopsy, the area of the&#xD;
      hip is anesthetized and a special needle is used to draw marrow from the hipbone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants receive an injection (shot) of each peptide vaccine into deep tissue of the&#xD;
      upper arm, upper leg, or the abdomen and two separate shots of sargramostim in the same area&#xD;
      as the vaccine shots. Patients' vital signs (heart rate, breathing rate, temperature, blood&#xD;
      pressure) are measured before and after they receive the vaccines and they are watched for 2&#xD;
      hours after the shots for possible side effects, such as chills, pain at the injection site,&#xD;
      stomach upset, allergic reaction, low blood counts, and infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients return to the clinic 1, 2, 3 and 4 weeks after receiving the vaccines for a brief&#xD;
      physical evaluation and blood tests. A chest x-ray is also done at the 4-week visit. Patients&#xD;
      may receive whole blood or platelet transfusions if needed to treat the MDS, growth factors&#xD;
      (filgrastim, erythropoietin, or others) if needed, and medications to treat any infections&#xD;
      that may develop.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Myeloid malignancies including acute myeloid leukemia and the related disorders&#xD;
      myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and myeloproliferative diseases represent a wide group of bone&#xD;
      marrow stem cell malignancies. Some patients can be cured with chemotherapy or by allogeneic&#xD;
      stem cell transplantation. However, a proportion of patients progress following chemotherapy&#xD;
      and some relapse after transplantation. Therefore, there is need for studies of&#xD;
      investigational agents to improve management of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The immunological graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect seen after allogeneic stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation suggests that stimulating the patient's own T cell responses to MDS and&#xD;
      leukemia with a vaccine might also retard disease progression and even achieve disease&#xD;
      remissions. WT1 and PR1 were identified as target antigens because both antigens are highly&#xD;
      expressed by CD34+ stem cells of most patients with myeloid malignancies but not by normal&#xD;
      marrow cells. An immunotherapeutic approach to vaccinate against PR1 and WT1 antigens could&#xD;
      induce T cell response against MDS and leukemic cells while sparing normal cells and by using&#xD;
      a combination of two antigens the risk of disease escape by antigen down regulation should be&#xD;
      further diminished.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, we propose to evaluate a vaccine composed of peptides derived from two proteins&#xD;
      over-expressed in MDS and leukemia stem cells - proteinase 3 (PR1) and Wilms tumor-1 (WT1).&#xD;
      This protocol, the first in a series of planned research, will evaluate the safety of a&#xD;
      single dose of a combination of two peptide vaccines, namely PR1:169-177 and WT-1:126-134 in&#xD;
      Montanide adjuvant administered concomitantly with GM-CSF (Sargramostim) in select subjects&#xD;
      diagnosed with MDS, AML and CML.&#xD;
