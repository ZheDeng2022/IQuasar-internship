  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the ability of a new X-ray technique called CT&#xD;
      angiography to identify significant narrowing of the coronary arteries compared to&#xD;
      traditional coronary angiogram.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with newly diagnosed cardiomyopathy it is the standard of care to perform&#xD;
      coronary angiography. This procedure can separate ischemic from non-ischemic cardiomyopathy&#xD;
      and identifies patients who may be eligible for revascularization as a therapeutic modality.&#xD;
      With the advent of multidectector row-computed tomography technology, it is becoming possible&#xD;
      to non-invasively identify significant atherosclerotic stenoses with acceptable sensitivity&#xD;
      and specificity. The goal of this study is to compare non-invasive computed tomography (CT)&#xD;
      angiography with traditional coronary angiography to identify proximal, and hence&#xD;
      revascularizable, coronary artery disease in patients with cardiomyopathy. Revascularizable&#xD;
      is defined a 3 vessel proximal disease, left main disease, or left main equivalent disease&#xD;
      (ostial left anterior descending and ostial left circumflex).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is prospective, interventional, single site with the interpreting radiologists&#xD;
      blinded to the results from previous angiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be patients with cardiomyopathy, defined as an ejection fraction less than 40%.&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria include known allergy to contrast medium, previous anaphylaxis, and renal&#xD;
      insufficiency (serum creatinine greater than 1.5). We would like to enroll 30 patients. After&#xD;
      giving informed consent, all eligible patients will undergo CT angiography, performed using&#xD;
      new multi-slice technology. The results of previously obtained transthoracic echocardiography&#xD;
      and standard coronary angiography will be reviewed. Following CT angiography all patients&#xD;
      will have a repeat measurement of serum creatinine to screen for contrast induced&#xD;
      nephropathy. Results of the CT angiography will be analyzed to determine sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity for identifying revascularizable coronary artery disease, compared to coronary&#xD;
      angiography as the gold standard.&#xD;
