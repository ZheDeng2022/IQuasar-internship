  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Allomatrix is a combination of Demineralized Bone Matrix with a binding medium of calcium&#xD;
      sulfate hemihydrate and carboxymethylcellulose. Allomatrix combines the osteoinductive&#xD;
      capacity of DBM with the osteoconduction and controlled resorption of surgical grade calcium&#xD;
      sulfate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unstable fractures of the distal radius do not resist displacement once it has been&#xD;
      manipulated into an anatomical position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a parallel between the quality of the anatomic result and the residual capacity of&#xD;
      the wrist, except in older, low demanding patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Injectable osteoconductive cements have been introduced to fill voids in metaphyseal bone and&#xD;
      may provide a better stability around hardware in osteoporotic bone and help maintain&#xD;
      reduction of fracture fragments.Moreover, a product like ALLOMATRIX could accelerate and&#xD;
      improve bone healing and fracture stability by its osteoinductive properties. However, the&#xD;
      clinical significance of these new bone graft materials still have to be proven in a&#xD;
      randomised controlled study set-up.&#xD;

      STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed as a randomised, prospective, study with concurrent control. A total of&#xD;
      50 patients will be enrolled by one centre and will be randomised into two groups. One group&#xD;
      of patients (comprising 50% of the study population) will have ALLOMATRIX Injectable Putty&#xD;
      implanted. In a control group of patients (comprising 50% of the study population as well )&#xD;
      no graft material will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomly assigned to one of the two treatment arms. Sequentially numbered&#xD;
      randomisation envelopes will be provided. Once the surgical reduction and stabilisation has&#xD;
      been completed, the next sequentially numbered randomisation envelope will be opened and the&#xD;
      patient will receive the treatment listed within the envelope. Each envelope will contain one&#xD;
      of the treatment arms based on a computer generated randomised schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DURATION AND ENDPOINTS OF THE STUDY The enrollment period is expected to be about 3 years.&#xD;
      Patients will be followed from a pre-operative visit through a one-year visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study End Points:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparison of time to healing of the fracture&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparison of function of operated wrist&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Radiographic and densitometric assessment of bone regeneration&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Failure rates (Non-union, malunion, fracture instability, wrist stiffness)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complication rates (infection, drainage, hardware failure, wound dehiscence)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bone growth factors (on blood samples from both forearms at 3 weeks after surgery)&#xD;
&#xD;
      PATIENT SELECTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is directed to unstable distal radius fractures among types I, III and V, according&#xD;
      to the classification of Fernandez (4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was decided to follow a group of younger patients because the outcome in older, low demand&#xD;
      patients is not significantly dependent of a precise reduction contrary to the outcome in&#xD;
      younger, high demand patients (15).&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY: PRACTICAL INFORMATION&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. For each patient presenting as a candidate for the study, the inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
           criteria should be reviewed. After informed consent, pre-operative data are collected&#xD;
           (see case report form) and regular pre-operative data are collected to plan the&#xD;
           operation. The patient is usually operated within one week after the injury with distal&#xD;
           radius fracture.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The treatment protocol of distal radius fractures relies on a decision scheme developped&#xD;
           by Fernandez and Wolfe (21). We favored percutaneous stabilisation over open reduction&#xD;
           and internal fixation. No significant clinical difference was noted between those two&#xD;
           techniques in unstable fractures (22). The surgical procedure is conducted under&#xD;
           brachial plexus anesthesia.For type I and III (4), the fracture is reduced manually with&#xD;
           image intensifier control. One or two Kirshner wires (1.5mm) are directed from the tip&#xD;
           of the radial styloid dorsally to the first extensor compartment at an angle of&#xD;
           approximately 45 degrees to cross the fracture and enter the dorsoulnar cortex of the&#xD;
           radius proximally to the fracture. These wires are placed using a power drill. An&#xD;
           additional wire is placed into the fracture fragment, inserted into the dorsoulnar&#xD;
           corner of the radius between the fourth and fifth extensor compartments and directed&#xD;
           from dorsoulnarly towards palmar radially in a distal to proximal direction.6 The tips&#xD;
           of the wires are bent and left just outside the skin, if necessary resorbable sutures&#xD;
           (Vicryl 3/0) are used. For type III fractures (4), an external fixator bridging the&#xD;
           joint completes usually the procedure. The criteria for reduction3 are an ulnar&#xD;
           inclination of 22°, a palmar inclination of 11°, neutral ulnar variance and radial width&#xD;
           (distance from the most lateral tip of the radial styloid process to the longitudinal&#xD;
           axis through the center of the radius on an AP film). A radioscopic image of the&#xD;
           contralateral wrist is taken in the operating room to serve as control, in the same&#xD;
           prosupination conditions, to be standardized in the radiology department(19,20). The&#xD;
           angles are measured preoperatively with an appropriate software (OEC radioscopy ) and&#xD;
           controlled postoperatively with the same radioscopy software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the surgical reduction and stabilization of the fracture, the sequentially&#xD;
      numbered randomization envelope will be opened and the patient will receive the treatment&#xD;
      listed within the envelope : either the ALLOMATRIX Injectable Putty or no additional graft.&#xD;
