      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a CRM (adapted Crew Resource Management&#xD;
      approach proven successful in aviation as well as some inpatient medical settings)&#xD;
      intervention is effective for reducing medication errors among older adults in primary care&#xD;
      settings.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Adverse drug events (ADEs) are among the most common and serious medication use concerns&#xD;
      among older patients in primary care practices, yet they are often preventable. This&#xD;
      translational research into practice (TRIP) pilot study uses a randomized trial to evaluate&#xD;
      the effect of a site-level intervention in a sample of practices in medically underserved&#xD;
      communities within the Upstate New York Practice Based Research Network (UNYNET). These sites&#xD;
      are located in rural and urban areas and include an over-sample of minority patients. The&#xD;
      specific aims of this study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Examine the feasibility of objectively assessing the impact of a CRM (adapted Crew&#xD;
           Resource Management approach proven successful in aviation as well as some inpatient&#xD;
           medical settings) intervention on reducing medication errors among geriatric patients in&#xD;
           primary care settings; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assess office staff internalization and application of CRM principles for reducing&#xD;
           geriatric medication errors in primary care settings by examining changes in safety&#xD;
           attitude constructs achieved&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. with a practice enhancement assistant (PEA) and&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. without a PEA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes measured for Aim #1 will be change in number, severity, consequence, and stage of&#xD;
      process of preventable ADEs. Outcomes for Aim # 2 will be change in safety climate, teamwork&#xD;
      climate, stress recognition, and working conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fifteen sites will be randomized into one of three intervention arms: usual care, CRM only,&#xD;
      or CRM plus a PEA. A random sample of charts of older adults (aged &gt;64) with cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease will be reviewed for adverse drug events over prior-year periods at baseline and&#xD;
      post-intervention endpoints. Participatory research methods will be used to assess provider-&#xD;
      and staff-identified barriers to implementation. This study will test the feasibility of&#xD;
      incorporating PEA's into the practice setting to improve geriatric medication safety. The&#xD;
      information gathered will serve as a basis for an ongoing translational research program that&#xD;
      will lead to an RO1 application.&#xD;
