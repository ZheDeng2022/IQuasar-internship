    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify novel genetic factors which distinguish breast&#xD;
      cancer in younger women compared to older women. By identifying these novel genetic factors&#xD;
      we believe more specific therapies can be developed and breast cancer may be prevented among&#xD;
      women with an increased cancer risk. A woman does not have to live in St. Louis to&#xD;
      participate.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer takes its greatest toll on younger women, as it is the leading category of&#xD;
      cancer deaths for women 20-39 years of age. Sadly, survival rates are lowest among women&#xD;
      diagnosed at a young age. This impact is most significant among African-American women who&#xD;
      have the highest incidence and mortality rate among women less than 45 years of age. The goal&#xD;
      of our program is to identify the genetic factors which distinguish breast cancer in younger&#xD;
      women compared to older women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women who were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer 40 years of age or younger are invited&#xD;
      to participate. The age at diagnosis is used to determine eligibility, not a woman's current&#xD;
      age. Women who have undergone genetic testing of the BRCA1, BRCA2, p53, pTEN, e-cadherin, or&#xD;
      LKB1 genes are eligible to participate. Young women with breast cancer are asked to: sign a&#xD;
      consent form, submit a sample of blood, release their cancer related records, and answer some&#xD;
      family history questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will use a family based case control approach in our analysis. As such, if a woman's&#xD;
      parents are living, they will be invited to participate as a &quot;comparison&quot; group. The parents&#xD;
      are asked to: sign a consent form, submit a sample of blood, and release any cancer records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A woman does not have to live in St. Louis to participate. All study related materials can be&#xD;
      mailed directly to the young woman or her parents. There is no expense to the family. All&#xD;
      materials are kept strictly confidential and participation is completely voluntary.&#xD;
