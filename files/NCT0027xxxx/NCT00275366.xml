      This purpose of this study is to determine the outcomes of the first-known application of&#xD;
      robotic therapy in the rehabilitation following rotator cuff repair, using a novel vertical&#xD;
      oblique robotic module.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Musculoskeletal conditions are a leading cause of disability in the United States accounting&#xD;
      for more than 130 million patient visits to healthcare providers annually. Rotator cuff tears&#xD;
      are one of the most common causes of pain and disability of the upper extremity. Impaired&#xD;
      motor control of the shoulder girdle muscles with concomitant instability often exists prior&#xD;
      to any surgical procedure. Re-tears and/or attenuation after rotator cuff repairs occur&#xD;
      relatively frequently and may compromise the functional result. Loading of the UE during&#xD;
      rehabilitation, thus the repair site, following the surgical procedure has been implicated in&#xD;
      these complications Conventional shoulder rehabilitation protocols with the human-human&#xD;
      interface do not possess the ability to systematically quantify dosing and progression for&#xD;
      patients in the subacute stages thus, potentially overloading the repair site. No&#xD;
      evidence-based research exists comparing outcomes of specific rehabilitative training&#xD;
      protocols in these post-surgical patients. Consensus statements conclude, �a need for&#xD;
      clinical trials, and validated outcome measures is essential�.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Advances in robotics technology offer unprecedented opportunities to improve rehabilitation&#xD;
      pathways, but until now these technologies have focused primarily on neurological disease.&#xD;
      The MIT Newman Laboratory for Biomechanics and Human Rehabilitation upper extremity (UE)&#xD;
      robot is an impedance controlled, back-drivable, oblique-vertical vertical robot that has&#xD;
      been designed such that it can safely exert controlled, graded forces to move or guide a&#xD;
      limb, functioning in passive, active-assistive, active and resistive modes, providing&#xD;
      objective data on the motion. A major advantage is its capacity for real-time, graded changes&#xD;
      based on patient input, providing stability against random perturbations, increasing or&#xD;
      withdrawing assistance and allowing for dose-specific treatment. The vertical robot device&#xD;
      has been shown to be safe and well tolerated without any adverse effects such as shoulder&#xD;
      pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goal-directed, quantifiable rehabilitation protocols for redevelopment of function through&#xD;
      improved range of motion, strength and motor control are lacking in patients with&#xD;
      musculoskeletal impairments. The successful robotic-assisted rehabilitation of the acute and&#xD;
      chronic, severe impairment provides an impetus for applying this technology to UE&#xD;
      musculoskeletal impairments. The ability to objectively control and measure the dosing and&#xD;
      progression during the rehabilitation process is a valuable tool in the advancement of&#xD;
      evidence�based rehabilitation interventions The proposed pilot clinical trial will determine&#xD;
      if 8-weeks of robotic rehabilitation improves the rate and quality of recovery of range of&#xD;
      motion, strength, and function following rotator cuff repair compared with a conventional&#xD;
      physical therapy rehabilitation protocol.&#xD;
