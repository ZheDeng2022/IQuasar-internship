  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study Design: This is a Phase I, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded study to&#xD;
      examine safety, tolerability and immune response of a prime-boost vaccination regimen for&#xD;
      treatment of HIV infection. The vaccination schedule consists of three injections of a&#xD;
      multiclade HIV plasmid DNA vaccine followed by one injection of a multiclade recombinant&#xD;
      adenoviral vector vaccine (rAd), in HIV-infected adults. The hypothesis is that this&#xD;
      vaccination regimen will be safe and elicit an immune response in HIV-infected subjects. The&#xD;
      primary objectives are related to evaluating the safety and tolerability of the vaccination&#xD;
      regimen and assessing the effect of vaccination on humoral and cellular immune responses to&#xD;
      vaccine-specific HIV antigens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Product Description: VRC-HIVDNA016-00-VP is composed of 6 closed, circular DNA plasmids that&#xD;
      are each 16.67% (by weight) of the vaccine. Each of the 6 plasmids in this vaccine expresses&#xD;
      a single gene product. Plasmids VRC 4401, VRC 4409 and VRC 4404 are designed to express clade&#xD;
      B HIV-1 Gag, Pol and Nef, respectively. VRC 5736, VRC 5737, and VRC 5738 are designed to&#xD;
      express HIV-1 Env glycoprotein from clade A, clade B, and clade C, respectively. Each DNA&#xD;
      vaccination will be 1 mL of vaccine administered intramuscularly (IM) using the Biojector&#xD;
      2000 Needle-Free Injection Management System. Phosphate buffered saline (PBS) will be used as&#xD;
      the placebo for the DNA vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP (rAd) is a recombinant product composed of 4 adenoviral vectors (Ad) (in&#xD;
      a 3:1:1:1 ratio) that encode the HIV-1 Gag/Pol polyprotein from clade B and HIV-1 Env&#xD;
      glycoproteins from clades A, B, and C, respectively. Injections of 10(10) PU will be&#xD;
      administered IM by needle and syringe. The final formulation buffer (FFB) will be used as the&#xD;
      placebo for the rAd vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects: HIV-infected adult volunteers (18-50 years old) on stable highly active&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy (HAART) therapy who have a CD4+ cell count greater than 350 cells/mm3&#xD;
      and have had a viral load (VL) less than 400 copies/mL for at least six months and a viral&#xD;
      load of less than 50 copies/mL within 4 weeks prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Plan: Fifteen volunteers will be enrolled and randomized in a 2:1 ratio to&#xD;
      vaccine:control (10 DNA prime with rAd boost:5 PBS with FFB placebo). A Data and Safety&#xD;
      Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review the study every 6 months. Subjects will be evaluated for&#xD;
      safety and immunogenicity for 48 weeks, which is 24 weeks after the target date for the&#xD;
      booster vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration: Subjects will be followed for 48 weeks after enrollment into the study.&#xD;

      This study will determine the safety and side effects of two experimental HIV vaccines and&#xD;
      see if vaccination can enhance the pre-existing HIV-specific immune response in HIV-infected&#xD;
      individuals on anti-retroviral therapy . The vaccines are VRC-HIVDNA016-00-VP (called the&#xD;
      &quot;DNA vaccine&quot;) and VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP (called the &quot;rAd vaccine&quot;). The DNA vaccine codes for&#xD;
      four HIV proteins. The rAd vaccine is made using an adenovirus (a common virus that causes&#xD;
      upper respiratory infections, such as the common cold) that has been modified to contain DNA&#xD;
      that codes for three HIV proteins. These vaccines will be given in a &quot;prime-boost&quot; schedule&#xD;
      and cannot cause HIV or adenoviral infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV-infected people between 18 and 50 years old who are on a stable treatment plan for HIV&#xD;
      with highly active antiretroviral (ARV) drugs, have a CD4+ T cell count greater than 350, and&#xD;
      have a low viral load may be eligible for this 48-week study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants receive an injection (shot) of the DNA vaccine or a placebo (solution that does&#xD;
      not contain any vaccine, medicine, or drugs) the day they enter the study and again at study&#xD;
      weeks 4 and 8. They receive a booster injection of the rAd vaccine or placebo at week 24. The&#xD;
      DNA vaccines are given with a needle-less injection device called the &quot;Biojector&#xD;
      2000(Registered Trademark)&quot; and the rAd vaccine is given using a needle and syringe. All&#xD;
      shots are given in the upper arm muscle, alternating right and left arms with each injection.&#xD;
      Patients fill out a diary card at home for 5 days after each vaccination, recording their&#xD;
      temperature and any symptoms. The cards are turned in to the clinic at the first visit after&#xD;
      all 5 days are completed. Patients must call a study nurse 1 or 2 days after each of the four&#xD;
      injections and again 7 or 8 days after each of the first three injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients have 12 clinic visits during the course of the study. At each visit, they are&#xD;
      checked for health changes or problems, asked how they are feeling and if they have taken any&#xD;
      medications or other treatments, including over-the-counter medicines, herbal supplements,&#xD;
      etc. Blood samples are drawn at every visit and urine samples are collected at some visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At week 28 (4 weeks after the fourth injection), patients undergo apheresis, a procedure for&#xD;
      collecting large numbers of white blood cells. The cells are tested in the laboratory to see&#xD;
      how the immune system responds to the study vaccine. For the procedures, blood is collected&#xD;
      through a needle in an arm vein and spun in a machine that separates the white blood cells&#xD;
      from the rest of the blood (red cells, plasma and platelets). The white cells are removed and&#xD;
      the rest of the blood is returned to the patient's body through the same needle. Patients who&#xD;
      cannot or do not want to undergo apheresis have 80 mL (about 1/3 cup) of blood drawn through&#xD;
      a needle and collected in blood collection tubes.&#xD;

             pregnancy test on the day of enrollment into the study. All female study participants&#xD;
             are presumed to be of reproductive potential unless they have been post-menopausal for&#xD;
             at least 24 consecutive months or have undergone surgical sterilization (e.g.&#xD;
             hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or salpingotomy). If participating in sexual&#xD;

        IUD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        If the female volunteer is not of reproductive potential as defined above she is eligible&#xD;
        without requiring the use of contraception. Patient-reported history is acceptable as&#xD;
        documentation of sterilization, contraceptive methods, or menopause.&#xD;
