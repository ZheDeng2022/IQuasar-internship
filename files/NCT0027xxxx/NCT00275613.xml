    <textblock>
      Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) is a relatively-rare, immune-mediated kidney&#xD;
      disease. All current therapies are inadequate and MPGN frequently leads to kidney failure.&#xD;
      This study is a 10 patient trial of the monoclonal antibody rituximab for adult patients with&#xD;
      MPGN. Study patients will receive 2 doses of rituximab intravenously on days 1 and 15 and&#xD;
      will then be followed for 1 year.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) is a relatively-rare, immune-mediated&#xD;
      glomerular disease. There is no accepted therapy and all current therapies are inadequate.&#xD;
      Current therapeutic options include immunosuppression with corticosteroids alone or in&#xD;
      combination with alkylating agents, antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and/or dipyridamole&#xD;
      and/or warfarin, and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and/or angiotensin receptor&#xD;
      blockers. As with other glomerular diseases the amount of protein in the urine correlates&#xD;
      well with the long-term prognosis. Thus, this parameter has been used in previous studies,&#xD;
      and will be used in this study, as the primary indicator of therapeutic efficacy. We propose&#xD;
      a pilot study to test the hypothesis that selective B lymphocyte depletion will result in&#xD;
      disappearance of pathogenic antibodies and induce remission of proteinuria in patients with&#xD;
      idiopathic membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. Our population will be 10 adults with&#xD;
      MPGN involving either the native kidneys or a renal transplant. We will enroll patients with&#xD;
      a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) greater than or equal to 25 ml/min, as estimated by&#xD;
      creatinine clearance, and with a 24 hour urinary ratio of protein to creatinine greater than&#xD;
      or equal to 1, while receiving an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or&#xD;
      angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB). Patients will receive Rituximab 1g on Day 1 and 15.&#xD;
      Patients will be followed for 1 year following completion of treatment. The primary outcome&#xD;
      will be the change in urinary protein excretion at 6 months. Secondary outcomes will include&#xD;
      changes in the GFR, changes in urinary protein excretion at 3, 9, and 12 months, the rate of&#xD;
      change in urinary protein excretion, serum albumin concentration, serum cholesterol, the&#xD;
      number of complete and partial remissions, time to remission, and the number of relapses.&#xD;
