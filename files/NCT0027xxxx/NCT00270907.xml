      The goal of this phase I clinical study is to find the highest safe dose of gemcitabine and&#xD;
      CT-2103 that can be given in combination for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. The&#xD;
      safety and effectiveness of this combination will also be studied. This clinical trial will&#xD;
      be offered to patients who are being considered for treatment with gemcitabine. Research lab&#xD;
      samples and research biopsies will not be requested as part of this study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CT-2103 is a chemotherapy drug designed to deliver an active chemotherapy medication&#xD;
      (paclitaxel) inside of tumor cells. Gemcitabine is FDA approved for the treatment of breast&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before you can start receiving drug on this study, you will have what are called &quot;screening&#xD;
      tests.&quot; These tests will help the doctor decide if you are eligible to take part in the&#xD;
      study. You will have a complete medical history and physical exam. You will have a CT scan of&#xD;
      the chest and abdomen, a bone scan, and a chest x-ray performed to document the size and&#xD;
      location of the tumor(s). Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests. Women&#xD;
      who are able to have children must have a negative blood-pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a dose of&#xD;
      CT-2103. Participants in this study will be enrolled in groups of 3. The first group will&#xD;
      receive the lowest dose of CT-2103. Each new group of patients will receive a higher dose&#xD;
      until the highest safe dose is found. The dose that you receive will depend on how many&#xD;
      patients have received CT-2103 before you. You will only be assigned to one dose level, and&#xD;
      you will stay at this same dose level for the entire study unless you have a serious side&#xD;
      effect that requires the dose to be decreased or stopped. All participants will receive the&#xD;
      same dose of gemcitabine, though it too may be lowered if severe side effects occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both CT-2103 and gemcitabine are given through a vein. On the first day of your therapy&#xD;
      (called 'Day 1'), you will receive a routinely given medication, ondansetron (Zofran), that&#xD;
      will help decrease the risk of nausea. About 30 minutes later, CT-2103 will be given over&#xD;
      10-20 minutes followed by gemcitabine over 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One week later ('Day 8'), you will receive gemcitabine through the vein over about 30&#xD;
      minutes. You will return to see your doctor 3 weeks after your first dose of chemotherapy&#xD;
      ('Day 21'), and then this pattern or cycle of treatment will be given again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will continue on therapy as long as the cancer is being controlled and you are not having&#xD;
      unexpected or intolerable side effects. All chemotherapy will be given at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have blood (about 2 tablespoons) collected once a week while you are on study to&#xD;
      monitor the effects of chemotherapy on your bone marrow and liver and kidney function. You&#xD;
      will see your doctor every 3 weeks to monitor how you are tolerating the therapy. At these&#xD;
      visits, your doctor will discuss any symptoms you are having, and you will have a physical&#xD;
      exam. If you are taking warfarin (Coumadin) you will need to have blood (about 1 tablespoon)&#xD;
      collected three times a week to monitor you warfarin levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After each 6 weeks of chemotherapy, you will have repeat scans to evaluate the effects of the&#xD;
      study drugs upon your cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once you have stopped taking therapy with CT-2103 and gemcitabine, you will be asked to&#xD;
      return to see your physician in about 6 weeks to evaluate how you are doing and to find out&#xD;
      if there has been any additional change in the cancer. You will have a complete medical&#xD;
      history and physical exam. You will have a CT scan of the chest and abdomen, a bone scan, and&#xD;
      a chest x-ray performed to document the size and location of the tumor(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Gemcitabine is FDA approved for the treatment of breast&#xD;
      cancer when given in combination with paclitaxel. Gemcitabine will not be provided free of&#xD;
      charge. CT-2103 is not yet FDA approved and will be provided free of charge during the study.&#xD;
      Any laboratory testing that is not standard of care will be paid for by the supporting&#xD;
      company. About 18 women will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Age &gt;/= 18 years. There is limited data regarding the use of CT-2103 in children under&#xD;
             18 and they will be excluded from this combination dose finding study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status &lt;/= 2 (Karnofsky &gt;/=&#xD;
             60%).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Measurable disease is not required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Previous endocrine therapies are allowed but should be discontinued prior to&#xD;
             initiation of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients must sign an informed consent indicating that they are aware of the&#xD;
             investigational nature of the study, in keeping with institutional policy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. The effects of CT-2103 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason&#xD;
             women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for&#xD;
             the duration of study participation. Females of childbearing potential are defined as&#xD;
             females who have not undergone a hysterectomy or who have not been postmenopausal for&#xD;
             at least 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below: leukocytes &gt;/=&#xD;
             3,000/ul; absolute neutrophil count &gt;/= 1,500/ul; platelets &gt;/= 100,000/ul; total&#xD;
             bilirubin within normal institutional limits; aspartate aminotransferase (AST or SGOT)&#xD;

             coagulation prothrombin time (PT) and Partial thromboplastin time (PTT) within normal&#xD;
             limits unless patients are already anti-coagulated for other reasons (i.e., atrial&#xD;
             fibrillation, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Patients with Her-2/neu positive tumors should have received prior trastuzumab if&#xD;
             clinically appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with preexisting neuropathy &gt;/= grade 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial&#xD;
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic&#xD;
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to CT-2103, gemcitabine or other agents used in study. History of typical&#xD;
             paclitaxel- or docetaxel-induced Grade 1-2 hypersensitivity reactions is permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks prior to entering&#xD;
             the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Previous history of stem cell transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. History of central nervous system metastases.&#xD;

             who experienced grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicity requiring the use of white blood&#xD;
             count (WBC) growth factor support during their most recent chemotherapy prior to&#xD;
             enrollment are excluded. Exceptions to this would include patients who received growth&#xD;
             factor support as mandated by a clinical study, and/or patients who have been off all&#xD;
             chemotherapy for at least 6 months.&#xD;
