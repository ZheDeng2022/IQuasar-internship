  <brief_summary>

      To compare the efficacy and safety of gabapentin, estrogen and placebo in the treatment of&#xD;
      hot flashes and other climacteric symptoms.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      HRT is associated with an increased risk of thrombo-embolic events, breast cancer and&#xD;
      cardiovascular events. Safe, effective, and well-tolerated alternative therapies for hot&#xD;
      flashes are needed. Gabapentin is a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-analog that we have&#xD;
      reported is associated with a reduction in the frequency of hot flashes in postmenopausal&#xD;
      women who were taking gabapentin for other indications. However, it is not known whether the&#xD;
      efficacy of gabapentin in the treatment of hot flashes and other menopausal symptoms is&#xD;
      comparable to that of estrogen, the gold standard. For this study, 60 subjects are to be&#xD;
      recruited and randomized into 3 arms of 20 each (gabapentin, estrogen and placebo).We will&#xD;
      perform an analysis of the results after all 60 subjects have been recruited, screened,&#xD;
      enrolled and completed the study. The investigators of the study continue to be blinded to&#xD;
      the study groups and their randomization. To determine if gabapentin approaches the efficacy&#xD;
      of estrogen in the treatment of hot flashes,postmenopausal women between ages 35 and 60 with&#xD;
      7-20 moderate-severe postmenopausal hot flashes/day will be randomized into a double-blinded&#xD;
      placebo controlled trial of estrogen, gabapentin and placebo. All patients must meet&#xD;
      stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria. Pre- and post-study hot flash diaries, depression&#xD;
      and climacteria scales will be collected. Patients are required to undergo physical&#xD;
      examination and blood work and to complete a daily hot flash and medication compliance&#xD;
      records. Hot flash frequency and composite score for hot flashes will be calculated for the&#xD;
      three groups based on the hot flash diary. Side effects, climacteric scale and depression&#xD;
      scales will also be used.&#xD;
