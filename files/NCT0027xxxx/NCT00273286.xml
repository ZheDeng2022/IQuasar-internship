  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized controlled trial to test whether a clinic-integrated, low&#xD;
      intensity, multi-component behavioral intervention is effective in preventing the&#xD;
      deterioration in glycemic control, treatment adherence, and quality of life that commonly&#xD;
      occur during late childhood and early adolescence in youth with type 1 diabetes. The study&#xD;
      will also examine mechanisms and processes that influence the effectiveness of family&#xD;
      management of diabetes during this developmental period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of a practical, low-cost,&#xD;
      low-intensity behavioral intervention that can be integrated directly into diabetes clinic&#xD;
      routines. The goal of the intervention is to prevent the deterioration in glycemic control,&#xD;
      treatment adherence, and quality of life that often occur during the transition to&#xD;
      adolescence in families of youth with type 1 diabetes. Four-hundred and eighty families (120&#xD;
      from each of the four sites) will be randomly assigned by the coordinating center to&#xD;
      intervention or standard care conditions. Standard care will be the multidisciplinary&#xD;
      management of type 1 diabetes as currently practiced at the clinical sites. Randomization&#xD;
      will be stratified by main versus recent-onset subgroup, age, and for the main subgroup,&#xD;
      baseline glycosylated hemoglobin level. Families will remain in their respective experimental&#xD;
      conditions for 24 months. A trained health advisor will be responsible for interactions with&#xD;
      parents and patients prior to each diabetes clinic visit (preparation phase), at the time of&#xD;
      the diabetes clinic visit (consolidation phase) and by phone, e-mail, etc. after the clinic&#xD;
      visit (follow-up phase). Using educational modules developed for the study, families will be&#xD;
      engaged in problem identification and solving activities to foster improved disease&#xD;
      management capabilities and improved parent-youth communication around and sharing of&#xD;
      responsibility for diabetes management. Families will be assessed at home three times and in&#xD;
      the clinic four times over the course of the study. Measures include parent, child, and&#xD;
      family characteristics that may affect intervention effectiveness, targeted mediators, family&#xD;
      interaction, management practices, and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c). Primary outcomes are&#xD;
      diabetes management adherence and metabolic control; secondary outcomes are quality of life,&#xD;
      health status, and psychosocial status.&#xD;
