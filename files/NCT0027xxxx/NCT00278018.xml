  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Melanoma is the main cause of death in patients with skin cancer. Once it has metastasized,&#xD;
      this cancer has been shown to respond to chemotherapy only in rare cases. Immunotherapy&#xD;
      represents an approach to treatment based on the immune response to cancer antigens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long-term objective of this study is to develop a therapeutic approach for the treatment&#xD;
      of cancer in general, and melanoma in particular, based on immunotherapy, using a combination&#xD;
      of local tumor irradiation followed by injection of immature dendritic cells (iDC).The&#xD;
      treatment will be followed by the injection of interferon alpha, which we expect will induce&#xD;
      activation of the iDC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial is based on the hypothesis that local radiation, which causes destruction of the&#xD;
      tumor, in combination with injection of the patient's own iDC and the activation of these&#xD;
      cells with interferon alpha, will induce an effective immune response against the tumor. In&#xD;
      order to test the suggested approach, we propose a 20-patients clinical trial that will&#xD;
      evaluate the objective clinical and immunological response to the proposed treatment in&#xD;
      patients with malignant melanoma and other solid tumors.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Any patient above age 18, with measurable metastatic melanoma or other solid tumor,&#xD;
             with at least one tumor deposit that is easily accessible to peri-tumoral DC&#xD;
             injection. The preferred location is subcutaneous or intradermal. Patients with&#xD;
             additional metastatic sites will not be excluded. Patients should have an expected&#xD;
             survival of greater than three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Patient must have received accepted standard treatment of his or her cancer:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  for melanoma - DTIC -containing protocol ,unless unwilling. Previous treatment&#xD;
                  with IL-2 is not an excluding factor.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  for breast cancer - adriamycin and cyclophosphamide, taxanes, and&#xD;
                  vinorelbine-containing protocols&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  for lung, renal and GIT cancers- one previous chemotherapy line&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Serum creatinine of 2.0 mg/dl or less.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Total bilirubin 1.6 mg/dl or less, except for patients with Gilbert's Syndrome who&#xD;
             must have a total bilirubin less than 3.0 mg/dl.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. WBC 3000/mm3 or greater.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Platelet count 90,000 mm3 or greater.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Serum AST/ALT less then two times normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. ECOG performance status of 0, 1 or 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients of both genders must be willing to practice effective birth control during&#xD;
             this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patient agreed to participate in the study and has signed a written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will be excluded:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. who are undergoing or have undergone in the past 3 weeks any other form of therapy&#xD;
             except from surgery for their cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. have active systemic infections, coagulation disorders, autoimmune disease or other&#xD;
             major medical illnesses of the cardiovascular or respiratory systems or any known&#xD;
             immunodeficiency disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. who require steroid therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. who are pregnant (because of possible side effects on the fetus).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. who are known to be positive for hepatitis B and C or HIV antibody (because of&#xD;
             possible immune effects of these conditions).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. who have any form of primary or secondary immunodeficiency. (The experimental&#xD;
             treatment being evaluated in this protocol depends on an intact immune system.&#xD;
             Patients who have decreased immune competence may be less responsive to the&#xD;
             experimental treatment and more susceptible to its toxicities.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. who are allergic to eggs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        i. who have an active major medical illnesses such as cardiac ischemia&#xD;
