      Patients will receive either a gel containing both calcipotriene plus betamethasone or gel&#xD;
      with no active ingredients as treatment for their scalp psoriasis for 8 weeks. After this&#xD;
      time all patients will receive the gel containing both calcipotriene and betamethasone for 44&#xD;
      weeks. In addition, patients will receive an ointment containing both calcipotriene plus&#xD;
      betamethasone as treatment for their psoriasis of the trunk and limbs for 52 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective is to study the short-term efficacy of the gel, and the short and long-term&#xD;
      safety of the gel and the ointment.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  An investigator's global assessment of moderate, severe or very severe scalp&#xD;
             psoriasis.&#xD;
