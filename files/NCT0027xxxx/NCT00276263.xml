  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether preventative treatment with sarcosine can&#xD;
      reduce symptoms and delay/avoid disease progression in individuals defined as being in a&#xD;
      prodromal stage of schizophrenia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects approximately 1% of the general&#xD;
      population and continues to be one of the major challenges of modern medicine due to the&#xD;
      tremendous human suffering and economic costs that it involves. Once the diagnosis of&#xD;
      schizophrenia or a related chronic psychosis has been made, the majority of patients will&#xD;
      only partially respond to presently available pharmacological treatments and will be&#xD;
      afflicted by long-standing deficits affecting all aspects of mental functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This unfavourable outcome highlights the importance of preventive treatment for schizophrenia&#xD;
      and related psychoses. The notion of early pharmacological intervention during the prodromal&#xD;
      phase of these disorders has a dual aim: 1) to treat active prodromal symptoms and 2) to&#xD;
      prevent further deterioration and progression toward the full-blown disorder and chronicity.&#xD;
      Overall, it raises the possibility of preventing, delaying or ameliorating the onset of the&#xD;
      diagnosable disorder. This type of intervention, although already in use in other medical&#xD;
      branches and potentially ground-breaking for mental health delivery systems, has not been&#xD;
      systematically assessed in the past. Recently, the development of improved criteria for&#xD;
      detecting individuals at high risk for developing schizophrenia and related psychoses, has&#xD;
      led to the first clinical trials that assessed the role of atypical antipsychotics (i.e.,&#xD;
      risperidone and olanzapine) for these subjects. The results of these studies indicate that&#xD;
      significant clinical benefits nay be derived from early intervention but also point to the&#xD;
      drawbacks of exposing patients at a very early stage of illness to antipsychotic drugs that&#xD;
      are associated with debilitating (i.e. motor, metabolic) side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall aim of the proposed project is to assess the efficacy and safety of the&#xD;
      N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptor (NMDAR) modulator, glycine transport inhibitor&#xD;
      sarcosine (N-methylglycine) for the treatment of individuals fulfilling schizophrenia&#xD;
      prodromal syndromes criteria. NMDAR's dysfunction plays a cardinal role in schizophrenia&#xD;
      pathophysiology and the establishment of neurodevelopmental deficits. During the last decade&#xD;
      it was demonstrated that pharmacological treatment with compounds that enhance NMDAR-mediated&#xD;
      neurotransmission due to their agonistic activity at the NMDAR-associated glycine site (e.g.&#xD;
      glycine, D-serine) leads to significant symptom reductions in chronic schizophrenia patients.&#xD;
      Furthermore, preliminary findings suggest that glycine treatment may also be beneficial for&#xD;
      patients at high risk for developing schizophrenia. By increasing glycine synaptic levels,&#xD;
      sarcosine may generate improved therapeutic effects in high risk individuals. Sarcosine is a&#xD;
      natural amino acid that has already been shown to reduce positive, negative and cognitive&#xD;
      symptomatology in chronic as well as acute schizophrenia patients. Advantages of sarcosine&#xD;
      vs. glycine site agonists use include the relatively low dose required and the lack of known&#xD;
      side effects. Synthetic compounds conceptually similar to sarcosine are presently in various&#xD;
      stages of development by major pharmacological companies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the proposed project, during a three-year period, 60 individuals fulfilling prodromal&#xD;
      criteria will be randomly entered in a 16 week parallel group, double-blind, placebo&#xD;
      controlled trial with 2 gr/day sarcosine, with an optional 8 week open-label extension.&#xD;
      Clinical, neurocognitive, electrophysiological, amino acids (i.e. glycine, serine, glutamate)&#xD;
      levels and genetic assessments will be performed during the study. The specific aims of the&#xD;
      proposed project are: 1) to assess the efficacy and safety of sarcosine as active treatment&#xD;
      for prodromal symptoms, 2) to assess sarcosine effects in terms of relevant amino acids serum&#xD;
      levels, neurocognitive performance and relevant brain electrophysiological parameters and 3)&#xD;
      to supply preliminary data in regard to the capacity of sarcosine treatment to delay/prevent&#xD;
      conversion to full blown psychotic disorder. The overall importance of the proposed project&#xD;
      consists of its potential to lay the foundations for an innovative type of treatment for&#xD;
      schizophrenia prodromal states.&#xD;
