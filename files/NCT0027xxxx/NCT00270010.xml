  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of epoetin alfa versus&#xD;
      placebo for the treatment of anemia in AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome) patients&#xD;
      with anemia that is a result of this disease and zidovudine (AZT) treatment. Epoetin alfa is&#xD;
      a genetically engineered protein that stimulates red blood cell production.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is estimated that approximately 75% to 80% of patients with AIDS experience anemia, which&#xD;
      can be caused by AIDS or by the therapy patients receive for AIDS treatment (for example,&#xD;
      AZT). Anemia is a condition in which a patient has below normal levels of hemoglobin, the&#xD;
      substance in red blood cells that carries oxygen to all parts of the body. People with severe&#xD;
      anemia may experience fatigue and shortness of breath with activity. Therefore, this&#xD;
      condition can have a negative influence on a person's quality of life. Epoetin alfa, used to&#xD;
      treat anemia, is a genetically engineered form of a natural hormone, erythropoietin, that&#xD;
      stimulates red blood cell production. This is a randomized, double-blind (neither the patient&#xD;
      nor the physician knows whether the patient is receiving epoetin alfa or placebo),&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, parallel group study with an open-label follow-up period that is designed&#xD;
      to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of epoetin alfa treatment in patients with AIDS who&#xD;
      are being treated with AZT. The study consists of 3 periods: a screening period to determine&#xD;
      if patients are eligible for the study, a double-blind period, and an open-label period.&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: a group receiving epoetin&#xD;
      alfa 200 U/kg or a group receiving a matching placebo. Patients will be treated with study&#xD;
      medication injected under the skin 3 times per week for 12 weeks (or until their hematocrit&#xD;
      reaches 38% to 40%). In the open-label period, all patients receive epoetin alfa injected&#xD;
      under the skin for up to 6 months. Effectiveness will be determined by the change in&#xD;
      hemoglobin and hematocrit (laboratory tests used to evaluate the severity of anemia),&#xD;
      transfusion requirements, the patient's quality of life assessment, and the physician's&#xD;
      global evaluation of the drug effect. Safety assessments include the incidence and severity&#xD;
      of adverse events during the study, and changes in clinical laboratory tests (hematology,&#xD;
      biochemistry, and urinalysis), vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and physical&#xD;
      examination findings. The study hypothesis is that AIDS patients who are receiving AZT and&#xD;
      who are treated with epoetin alfa will have a lower incident of anemia compared with patients&#xD;
      receiving placebo. Double-blind: epoetin alfa (200 U/kg) or placebo given under the skin 3&#xD;
      times a week for 12 weeks or until hematocrit reaches 38% to 40%. Open-label: epoetin alfa&#xD;
      250 U/kg 3 times a week for up to 6 months (once weekly after hematocrit reaches 38% to 40%).&#xD;
      Dosage may be adjusted up to 300 U/kg.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of AIDS, exhibiting signs and symptoms of AIDS&#xD;
             characterized by lymphocytopenia (decrease in the number of lymphocytes [cells that&#xD;
             are typical elements of lymph tissue] in the blood) as determined by a finding of&#xD;
             &lt;1,000 cells/cubic millimeter&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  having a documented HIV antibody (either a history of infections due to the patient's&#xD;
             impaired resistance or the presence of severe symptoms, such as persistent fever or&#xD;
             night sweats associated with significant weight loss)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  receiving AZT therapy of at least 400 mg/day&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  having a hematocrit &lt;=30%, and a history of a &gt;=15% decrease in hematocrit since&#xD;
             starting AZT therapy, or that the patient has become dependent on transfusions&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  clinically stable for at least 1 month before study entry, with a performance score of&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  having a sudden onset of infections, dementia due to AIDS, uncontrolled high blood&#xD;
