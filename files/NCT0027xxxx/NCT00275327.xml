      o determine if extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamases,&#xD;
      carbapenemases, chromosomal mutations in ribosomal RNA or other mechanisms of resistance&#xD;
      account for antibiotic resistance in commonly encountered Gram negative and Gram positive&#xD;
      bacteria at UPMC. Also to determine the molecular epidemiology and in vitro susceptibility of&#xD;
      multiply resistant organisms at UPMC and to relate this to antibiotic use in the institution.&#xD;

      The following variables will be followed: time and location of positive cultures, underlying&#xD;
      diseases and severity of illness, recent immunomodulative therapies, physical exam findings,&#xD;
      laboratory and radiographical data, antimicrobial usage of onset of infection,&#xD;
      microbiological data and resistance patterns, choice of antibiotics once organism identified,&#xD;
      suspected source of infection, bacteriological outcomes, laboratory results, demographic&#xD;
      information, medications, clinical outcome gender, height, weight, ethnicity, and past&#xD;
      medical history. The following variables will be followed: time and location of positive&#xD;
      cultures, underlying diseases and severity of illness, recent immunomodulative therapies,&#xD;
      physical exam findings, laboratory and radiographical data, antimicrobial usage of onset of&#xD;
      infection, microbiological data and resistance patterns, choice of antibiotics once organism&#xD;
      identified, suspected source of infection, bacteriological outcomes, laboratory results,&#xD;
      demographic information, medications, clinical outcome gender, height, weight, ethnicity, and&#xD;
      past medical history. The bacteria in the patient's cultures will be subcultured (after the&#xD;
      diagnosis has been obtained since the microbiology lab would otherwise destroy the culture)&#xD;
      and provided to the honest broker who will deidentify the specimen and link it to the medical&#xD;
      information collected (which will also be deidentified by the honest broker). Patient data&#xD;
      will be entered into a database by the honest brokers using an excel program for electronic&#xD;
      data capture and reporting system. The honest brokers will have access to the database to&#xD;
      ensure data integrity and perform data analyses. In addition, the Honest Broker will obtain&#xD;
      information from the medical record as well as information about the specimens. The research&#xD;
      team will have access to the database that is deidentified. The following evaluation will be&#xD;
      performed on the bacteria. The minimal inhibitory concentration of the antibiotic used in&#xD;
      treatment will be performed by the E-Test method (AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden). Specific&#xD;
      mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance will be studied with emphasis on the molecular&#xD;
      mechanisms of antibiotic resistance such as production of beta-lactamases. This evaluation&#xD;
      will be performed by analytical isoelectric focusing techniques as well as PCR and gene&#xD;
      sequencing analysis to determine genes encoding beta-lactamases. Biologic samples will be&#xD;
      under the control of the principal investigator of this research project. All samples&#xD;
      provided to the investigators are deidentified by the honest broker and will be coded with&#xD;
      numbers. The information linking these code numbers to the corresponding subjects' identities&#xD;
      will be kept in a separate, secure location that only the honest broker has access to. The&#xD;
      investigators on this study will keep the samples indefinitely. Samples will be kept in the&#xD;
      investigator's laboratory located in Scaife Hall, room 812, 3500 Terrace Street. At no time&#xD;
      will the research investigators have access to any patient identifiers.&#xD;

      No genetic testing will be performed on any of the samples being obtained. The biologic&#xD;
      samples will be under the control of the principal investigator of this research project. To&#xD;
      protect confidentiality, all personal identifiers (i.e., name, social security number, and&#xD;
      birth date) will be removed (de-identified) and replaced with a specific code number. The&#xD;
      information linking these code numbers to the corresponding subjects' identities will be kept&#xD;
      in a separate, secure location. The investigators on this study will keep the samples&#xD;
      indefinitely. If a subject withdraws and provides the request in writing, samples collected&#xD;
      and not already processed will be destroyed. All samples will be kept in the investigator's&#xD;
      laboratory located in Scaife Hall, Room 812, 3550 Terrace Street.&#xD;
