    <textblock>
      Past research on nicotine addiction has shown that changes in estradiol and progesterone&#xD;
      hormone levels during menstruation may cause women to respond differently than men to&#xD;
      nicotine. The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of progesterone on smoking&#xD;
      behavior, nicotine withdrawal symptoms, and the reinforcing effects of smoking in men and&#xD;
      women addicted to nicotine.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nicotine addiction is a serious health problem. Almost 35 million people in the United States&#xD;
      try to quit smoking each year, but less than 7 percent are successful. Many smokers report a&#xD;
      &quot;high&quot; sensation, followed by a feeling of relaxation. Such positive reinforcement factors,&#xD;
      combined with nicotine cravings, make it difficult to stop the use of nicotine products. Past&#xD;
      research has suggested that women may experience fewer nicotine cravings and may be less&#xD;
      affected by smoking's positive reinforcement factors when compared to men. Fluctuations in&#xD;
      levels of the female hormones estradiol and progesterone during menstruation may play a role&#xD;
      in determining how women are affected by nicotine. The purpose of this study is to examine&#xD;
      the effects of a controlled oral dose of progesterone on smoking behavior, nicotine&#xD;
      withdrawal symptoms, and nicotine-related positive reinforcement factors in nicotine&#xD;
      dependent males and females.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this 4-day study, participants will be randomly assigned to receive a daily dose of 200 mg&#xD;
      of progesterone, 400 mg of progesterone, or placebo. All participants will abstain from&#xD;
      smoking for Days 1 through 3. On Day 4, participants will take part in a smoking session,&#xD;
      during which their smoking habits, including the number of puffs, duration of puffs, and&#xD;
      number of cigarettes smoked, will be measured. Outcome measurements will include self-reports&#xD;
      of cravings; carbon monoxide monitoring; and standardized questionnaires to assess nicotine&#xD;
      withdrawal symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has been completed with 35 men and 30 women. With the final women completing in&#xD;
      March of 2008. This protocol is complete and has been published.&#xD;
