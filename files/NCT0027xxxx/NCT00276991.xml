      This research work is important for the cure/control of HIV infection. The objectives of a&#xD;
      treatment case on HIV patient is essentially to bring down the viral load closer to&#xD;
      undetectable level. The studies are depend on the potential influence of 'Kallunk Oxide' on&#xD;
      the CD4+ T cells and the effectiveness on surface of HIV-1. The basic study is to break&#xD;
      surface protein and directly inhibit a protein's increased functions, not only in the CD4+T&#xD;
      cell but also CD3 and CD8+ T cells, by appropriate antidote.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 'Yogaprabhava', the drug's effectiveness, and progressive immunity with diet and&#xD;
      lifestyle can be more easily studied.&#xD;

      This research was individual investigator initiated meritorious project to identify potential&#xD;
      roles for the safe and effective use of Complementary and Alternative Medicine CAM in the&#xD;
      treatment of HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This modest Phase-I and phase II clinical trials were intervention Studies. In the case of&#xD;
      HIV infections, these studies were formulated each 20 random numbered batch. The Principal&#xD;
      Investigator (PI) selects the informed consented patients and the recruited study was adhered&#xD;
      by Helsinki Declaration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection of subjects: HIV patients with CD3, CD4, and CD8 + T cell counts &gt;450 cu/mm^3 were&#xD;
      enrolled in Wing No: 1 group. HIV patients with CD+ T cell counts &gt;450 cu/mm^3 were recruited&#xD;
      for basic Arm study. The selected Arm - 1 of this research, the specific and potential&#xD;
      milestone on baseline CD+T cell counts &gt;450 cu/mm^3 was determined from the outcomes of&#xD;
      previously conducted Observational Phase-1 study data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistical evaluation laboratory on parameters in exists group was measured through&#xD;
      Immune Cells Count Assay. The prolonged viral suppression and reversal of HIV seropositivity&#xD;
      were the ultimate research outcomes and this study was evaluated the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      this drug. Absolute assays of Viral Load, Lymphocyte Enumeration, Western Blot blood test and&#xD;
      convinced mean values and reference range methods were adopted for laboratory study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drug was administered as optimal doses 200 mg and 500 mg to study subjects, respectively,&#xD;
      between 8 and 17 years old children and 18 and 65 years old Men and Women as anticipated 500&#xD;
      Female and 500 Male participants. The ELISA/P-24 test was used to confirm HIV-seropositivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients safe and effective optimum dose was the primary out come measure and the Viral&#xD;
      Load assay and Immune Cells Count assay were the secondary outcome measure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomized numbers were arranged with single patient's clinical records. Patient's body&#xD;
      weight, CD4 T cells count, skin thickness, body measurements, blood pressure, temperature,&#xD;
      pulse rates, anti body count, and other hematological examinations were investigated before&#xD;
      and after the treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The well-designed research team minds the symptoms such as nausea, fatigue,weight loss,&#xD;
      sweating, shortness of breath, joint pain etc and the Side effects of this treatment, if any,&#xD;
      could be carefully noted. On entry and at the end of this study, the biochemical&#xD;
      investigations such as urine examination, serum lipoprotein and cholesterol were individually&#xD;
      noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient's temperature, digestion complaints, or chill, etc could treated by medicine and&#xD;
      restricted diets without using mutton soup, milk, and cow ghee. The study was reduced&#xD;
      patient's stress as well as depression and also managed the productivity, emotional well&#xD;
      being, immunity and quality of life by the practice of this treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was handled a transparent privacy environment to recruit HIV-infected people in&#xD;
      India.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dosage:&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV patients were administered with once daily dose of sample size product, 500 mg for adults&#xD;
      and 200 mg for children (up to 8 years old), as one course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Controlled Nourished diet:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients were adhered with nourished diet protocol. The controlled diets were milk (only&#xD;
      1/2 cup), rice and wheat food products, cow ghee, green gram, mutton soup, and prepared black&#xD;
      pepper added vegetable foods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Restriction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV-Patients were not used salts, other oils, mustard, and tamarind fish items within 10 days&#xD;
      of this medication use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV- patients were used one drug &quot;Kallunk oxide (Immunotherapy)&quot; as calcined/or oxidized&#xD;
      molecules. The powder form sample size medicine was put into 1/2 cup hotter water (an&#xD;
      adjuvant).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Precaution:&#xD;
&#xD;
      No precautions be needed. Patients were not used sediments at the bottom of the cup.&#xD;

    <description>The study was assigned only one Arm &gt;450 cu/mm^3 of baseline CD + T cells. HIV type-1 subjects were received one drug, a daily regimen of &quot;Kallunk oxide(Immunotherapy) + Long Pepper&quot;, that is a combination of a traditional alternative medicine(Complementary and Alternative Medicine CAM) as &quot;Kallunk oxide&quot; and appropriate drug carrier antidote. The drug assigns to 0.100 mg and 0.200 mg &quot;Kallunk oxide&quot; molecules with 199.900 mg, and 499.800 mg &quot;Antidote&quot;( This antidote was used as a carrier of &quot;Kallunk oxide&quot; molecules), respectively, for children and adults. Dosage: 200 mg for children and 500 mg for adults. This powder form sample size product was administered once daily dose on 5 days treatment.
