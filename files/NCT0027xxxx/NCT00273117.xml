  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Two groups of patients were randomised into two groups of either transnasal gastroscopy or&#xD;
      conventional type gastroscopy (n=98). The aim of the study was to evaluate the&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory effects and sideeffects of the two methods, and to evaluate the technical&#xD;
      features of the transnasal endoscope.&#xD;

      Introduction Esophagogastroduodenoscopy is the gold standard investigation for upper&#xD;
      gastrointestinal disorders. To make the procedure safer and more comfortable, thinner&#xD;
      endoscopes for conventional oral or for transnasal intubation have been designed. Several&#xD;
      trials have been conducted suggesting greater patient tolerance with the thinner scope. At&#xD;
      the same time scope features have improved and are increasingly compatible with the standard&#xD;
      endoscope. This prospective, randomised study was conducted to evaluate the cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      effects, the patient tolerance, and endoscopist evaluation comparing thin transnasal with&#xD;
      conventional transoral endoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and Methods Outpatients referred to diagnostic, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy&#xD;
      were included consecutively after written informed consent. Inclusion criteria were age over&#xD;
      18 years, Danish-language, no history of disease in the nasal cavity and intended diagnostic&#xD;
      endoscopy. Ninety-eight patients were included and randomised to either conventional oral&#xD;
      gastroscopy (OG) or transnasal gastroscopy (TG).The patients were randomized by consecutively&#xD;
      numbered envelopes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients answered a questionnaire clarifying their previous experience of gastroscopy,&#xD;
      and if relevant, the discomfort of previous examination and their anxiety for the actual&#xD;
      examination on a visual analogue scale (VAS scale). A post endoscopy questionnaire evaluated&#xD;
      discomfort during the examination in general, during introduction of the endoscope and for&#xD;
      the rest of the examination (VAS scale). The following parameters were assessed by answering&#xD;
      yes or no; gagging, choking, pain from the nose, throat and the stomach. The patients stated&#xD;
      whether the degree of discomfort had been greater, lesser or as expected compared to previous&#xD;
      endoscopy and whether they in a future gastroscopy would prefer sedation, and finally they&#xD;
      stated their preference for a future procedure (OG/TG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      TG were carried out using Olympus Videoscope GIF-N230 (Olympus Optical Ltd., Tokyo, Japan)&#xD;
      with an outer diameter of 6 mm and working length of 925 mm (first 15 patients); and later&#xD;
      Olympus Videoscope GIF-XP160 (33 patients) with an outer diameter of 5.9 mm, and a working&#xD;
      length of 1030 mm. OG were carried out using Olympus Videoscope GIF-Q160 with an outer&#xD;
      diameter of 9.5 mm and a working length of 1030 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients received topical anaesthesia; before TG xylocain gel were inhaled into each&#xD;
      nostril and before OG xylocain spray (10 mg/dose), 4 doses were spayed into the pharyngeal&#xD;
      cavity. Intravenous sedation using midazolam were used only if specifically requested by the&#xD;
      patient. The patients were positioned in the left lateral recumbent position during the&#xD;
      procedures. Endoscopies were performed by experienced endoscopists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2 ) and heart rate (HR) were measured by a pulse oximeter&#xD;
      (Nellcor Symphony N-3000, Nellcor Puritan Bennet Inc., Pleasanton, CA) twice with an interval&#xD;
      of one minute before the procedure; twice during the procedure (one and three minutes after&#xD;
      intubation) and finally one and two minutes after extubation. The minimum SpO2 and maximum HR&#xD;
      were noted as was the duration of the procedure. Biopsies were taken when indicated, and the&#xD;
      qualities of the biopsies were assessed. Adverse effects during the endoscopies were noted;&#xD;
      e.g. epistaxis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the endoscopy, the endoscopists answered a questionnaire evaluating the following&#xD;
      parameters using a VAS score: intubation, ability to aspirate gastric contents, visualization&#xD;
      of the esophagus, the stomach, the bulb and the second part of duodenum. The presence of&#xD;
      chromatic aberrations (after flushing and aspiration), were also assessed. It was noted&#xD;
      whether the length of the scope was sufficient, and also in case of TG, the presence of uni-&#xD;
      or bi-lateral stenosis of the nasal cavity and looping in esophagus. If TG could not be&#xD;
      carried out, the reasons were noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, the endoscopists assessed their total subjective evaluation of the endoscopy on a&#xD;
      one-to-six scale (one: unacceptable, six: perfect).&#xD;
