  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the hemodynamic (blood flow) and clinical effects of&#xD;
      the study drug, Natrecor (nesiritide, a recombinant form of the natural human peptide&#xD;
      normally secreted by the heart in response to heart failure) to those of intravenous&#xD;
      nitroglycerin or placebo, when added to the standard care therapy that is usually&#xD;
      administered in the treatment of patients with worsening congestive heart failure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Advanced congestive heart failure (CHF) accounts for over 1 million hospital admissions&#xD;
      yearly in the U.S. and is also associated with a high rate of readmission to the hospital&#xD;
      within a short turn-around time period following discharge. CHF is associated with a&#xD;
      relatively high death rate, up to 40 or 50% in 2 years. The risk of sudden cardiac death in&#xD;
      patients with CHF is 6 to 9 times greater than that of the general population. Despite&#xD;
      medical advances, some patients are unresponsive to the oral medications used to treat CHF&#xD;
      and require added therapy. Such patients are typically New York Heart Association (NYHA)&#xD;
      Class III and IV, and require intravenous (IV) therapy with inotropic agents. Inotropic&#xD;
      agents are drugs that influence muscular contractility. IV administration with inotropic&#xD;
      drugs requires careful patient selection and close monitoring to ensure safe and effective&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are many medical conditions that lead to worsening CHF and these underlying conditions&#xD;
      contribute to a significant and potentially life-threatening loss of cardiac function. Some&#xD;
      of these are conditions that lead to abnormal cardiac contraction and/or relaxation (e.g.,&#xD;
      coronary arterial disease, hypertension, diabetes, drug or alcohol toxicity); conditions that&#xD;
      lead to volume or pressure overload (mitral or tricuspid valve regurgitation,&#xD;
      hyperthyroidism); and conditions that limit ventricle filling (e.g., mitral or tricuspid&#xD;
      valve stenosis). However, many patients have a condition of dilated cardiomyopathy, an&#xD;
      abnormality of the heart muscle wall in which the walls of the heart become stretched and&#xD;
      weakened, with no easily identifiable cause. Any risk factor may cause CHF, but combinations&#xD;
      dramatically increase the risk of developing CHF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Natriuretic peptides ANP and BNP are small molecules and are the group of naturally-occuring&#xD;
      substances that act in the body to oppose the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone&#xD;
      (RAA) system. They serve as counter-regulatory hormones and are secreted in response to the&#xD;
      increased atrial and ventricular stretching that occurs in secondary increased blood volume.&#xD;
      Natrecor (nesiritide) is the proprietary name for the IV formulation of human B-type&#xD;
      natriuretic peptide (hBNP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In-patient treatment for acutely decompensated CHF with intravenous vasodilator therapy (such&#xD;
      as nitroglycerin or nitroprusside) is useful for a number of reasons. Vasodilators reduce&#xD;
      ventricular filling pressure and volume, decreasing pulmonary congestion and the resulting&#xD;
      symptoms of breathlessness. Intravenous vasodilators may also achieve afterload reduction&#xD;
      leading to decreased mitral regurgitation and increased forward stroke volume. IV&#xD;
      administration of externally produced hBNP leads to vasodilation, antagonism of the&#xD;
      renin-aldosterone system and an increase in diuresis. hBNP may be a potent agent for the&#xD;
      treatment of CHF, with a unique combination of desirable blood flow throughout the body,&#xD;
      hormones secreted by the sympathetic nervous system, and renal effects not possessed by&#xD;
      currently available therapies. In a 6-hour placebo-controlled comparison in patients with&#xD;
      acutely decompensated CHF, Natrecor® was associated with significant improvements in the&#xD;
      symptoms of CHF (including dyspnea and fatigue), a decrease in aldosterone, and an increase&#xD;
      in urine output. (According to LeJemtel et al 1998) The VMAC trial (Vasodilation in the&#xD;
      Management of Acute CHF) is a double-blinded, randomized, active-controlled and&#xD;
      placebo-controlled study in which the study drug would be added to standard care therapies&#xD;
      such as diuretics, dobutamine, or dopamine. This study compares the effects of the addition&#xD;
      of Natrecor®, nitroglycerin, or placebo to standard care (diuretics, dobutamine, dopamine, or&#xD;
      other long-term cardiac therapies) in patients requiring hospitalization for the treatment of&#xD;
      dyspnea at rest due to acutely decompensated CHF. Based on the cumulative experience with&#xD;
      Natrecor, the dose of Natrecor was modified for the VMAC trial to a 2-µg/kg bolus followed by&#xD;
      a 0.01-µg/kg/min infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the VMAC study is to compare the blood flow and observe treatment&#xD;
      and safety effects of the new dose of Natrecor to placebo, when added to standard care, in&#xD;
      the treatment of acutely worsening CHF. The primary overall outcome that the study plan is&#xD;
      based upon are the changes from the beginning of a study to 3 hours after the start of study&#xD;
      drug, in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) (in subjects who have right heart&#xD;
      catheters only) and the subject's self-evaluation of their breathing difficulties. The&#xD;
      secondary objective is to compare the hemodynamic, (blood flow throughout the body) and&#xD;
      clinical effects of Natrecor® with IV nitroglycerin and placebo. Additional objectives&#xD;
      include a comparison of the use of other IV vasoactive agents and/or IV diuretics and the&#xD;
      effects on other hemodynamic variables. The hypothesis of this study is that using the&#xD;
      modified dose of Natrecor, (a 2-µg/kg bolus followed by a 0.01-µg/kg/min infusion) will&#xD;
      achieve peak effects sooner than with previously studied doses, to sustain effects for at&#xD;
      least 48 hours, and minimize excessive effects on blood pressure. Natrecor or placebo,&#xD;
      administered as an intravenous 2-µg/kg bolus, followed by a fixed-dose infusion of&#xD;
      0.01-µg/kg/min.&#xD;
