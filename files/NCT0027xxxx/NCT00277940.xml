  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Abnormalities of the aorta have been identified in patients who have undergone repair of&#xD;
      coarctation of the aorta by various surgical techniques. These abnormalities are thought to&#xD;
      contribute to ventricular hypertrophy, hypertension and exercise intolerance. Aortic arch&#xD;
      reconstruction is performed for a variety of lesions besides simple coarctation of the aorta;&#xD;
      these include hypoplastic left heart syndrome and its variants. In the latter group of&#xD;
      patients extensive reconstruction is performed usually with a pulmonary homograft. We have&#xD;
      previously shown that the neo-aortic dimensions and geometry are abnormal. The elastic&#xD;
      properties of the neo-aorta, however, have not previously been described.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the present study we proposed to examine neo-aortic properties in a cohort of children&#xD;
      with single ventricle heart defects who have undergone the bi-directional Glenn procedure&#xD;
      (with or without Norwood palliation) and compare them to a cohort of patients with single&#xD;
      ventricle who have had no aortic arch interventions. Patients in both groups typically&#xD;
      undergo the Fontan operation between 18-48 months of age. After arrival to the operating&#xD;
      suite and the placement of routine instrumentation, a transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)&#xD;
      is routinely obtained. All data needed for this protocol is obtained during this TEE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The stiffness of the aorta will be determined by calculating the pressure-strain elastic&#xD;
      modulus (Ep) and the stiffness index beta (β). They are calculated from the formula&#xD;
      Ep=[Ps-Pd]/[Ds-Dd/Dd] and β = [ln Ps/Pd[Ds-Dd]. Pressure-strain elastic modulus measurements&#xD;
      have been utilized to measure the stiffness of the aorta and carotid arteries in both adults&#xD;
      and children with a high reproducibility and low interobserver variability. The stiffness&#xD;
      index beta has been proposed as a better measure of aortic stiffness because of its&#xD;
      independence from measured blood pressure. The ability of a vessel to distend to store extra&#xD;
      volume due to pressure effects is known as its compliance. A vessel with a higher compliance&#xD;
      will be more &quot;stretchy&quot; and will therefore be more favorable to holding a greater volume of&#xD;
      blood rather than storing a lot of pressure energy. Conversely, a vessel with a lower&#xD;
      compliance will be less &quot;stretchy&quot; and therefore be more favorable to storing a lot of&#xD;
      pressure energy rather than holding a greater volume of blood. Essentially, if two vessels&#xD;
      are of equal size (cross-sectional flow area and volume), but one vessel has a lower&#xD;
      compliance, then a 1 milliliter change in volume of the lower compliance (less stretchy)&#xD;
      vessel will result in a greater pressure increase than a 1 milliliter change in volume of the&#xD;
      higher compliance (more stretchy) vessel. Compliance will be assessed by the use of automatic&#xD;
      border detection. This provides a continuous measure of the vessel cross-sectional area over&#xD;
      time. Compliance is calculated by (Areamax-Areamean/mean blood pressure).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood pressure data will be recorded simultaneously with an arterial catheter that is used&#xD;
      routinely during the operation.&#xD;
