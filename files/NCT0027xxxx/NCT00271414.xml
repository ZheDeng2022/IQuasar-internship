      The objective of this study is to assess the safety and clinical utility of DuragesicÂ® 12.5&#xD;
      micrograms/hour (a transdermal patch delivering the narcotic pain-reliever fentanyl) in the&#xD;
      treatment of children ages 2 to 12 with continuous pain requiring narcotic pain relief&#xD;
      therapy. Pharmacokinetics (fentanyl levels in the bloodstream during treatment) will also be&#xD;
      assessed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A new dosage strength of Duragesic® TTS patch was developed to deliver 12.5 micrograms of&#xD;
      fentanyl per hour, which is considered to be equi-analgesic to a daily dose of 45 mg of&#xD;
      morphine administered orally, and considered a safe starting dose in children aged 2 to 12&#xD;
      years. This is a single-arm, non-randomized, open-label, 15-day multicenter trial to&#xD;
      determine the safety, clinical utility, and pharmacokinetics of Duragesic® in pediatric&#xD;
      subjects who require treatment with a potent opioid for the management of continuous pain,&#xD;
      allowing individual titration. After the 15-day primary treatment period, subjects may, at&#xD;
      the investigator's discretion, continue long-term treatment with Duragesic® for a period of&#xD;
      up to 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects start treatment with a 12.5 micrograms/hour patch. Immediate-release morphine is&#xD;
      available to treat breakthrough pain. The patches are replaced every 72 hours. The objective&#xD;
      is to have subjects pain-free as much as possible, using the least possible rescue&#xD;
      medication. Duragesic® dose increases are considered based on rescue medication consumption&#xD;
      and pain assessment. Where a subject is maintained pain-free with a daily consumption of 45&#xD;
      mg of rescue morphine or more, a dose increase of Duragesic® with 12.5 micrograms/hour is&#xD;
      permitted. No increase in Duragesic® dose is to be performed within the 72-hour dosing&#xD;
      interval. The primary outcome of this study is an assessment of safety, including the&#xD;
      incidence and severity of adverse events, and physical examination results and vital signs.&#xD;
      Clinical utility is assessed by the parent's treatment assessment of pain relief,&#xD;
      tolerability and convenience (pre-treatment and after each patch change); the investigator's&#xD;
      and the parent's global assessments on Day 16 of pain control, adverse events, and&#xD;
      convenience; daily measures of pain levels; use of rescue medication; and the child's play&#xD;
      performance. Pharmacokinetics will also be assessed. Duragesic® will be applied to the upper&#xD;
      torso, and replaced every 72 hours. The initial dose is one patch with a fentanyl delivery&#xD;
      rate of approximately 12.5 micrograms/hour. Dose increases in steps of 12.5 micrograms/hour&#xD;
      are considered if pain is inadequately controlled. The treatment phase is 15 days.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pediatric (age 2-12) patients suffering from continuous pain of a well-documented&#xD;
             cause&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  currently requiring treatment of pain with a strong opioid and expected to continue to&#xD;
             require treatment with a strong opioid for the next 7 days&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  prior therapy for pain included a minor analgesic, weak opioid, or strong opioid&#xD;
             equivalent to the pain relief of 45 mg morphine or less a day&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of allergy or hypersensitivity to fentanyl or morphine&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  have active skin disease that precludes application of Duragesic® or which may affect&#xD;
             the absorption of fentanyl&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  have a life expectancy was less than 1 month&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  have a clinical condition that in the investigator's judgment prevents participation&#xD;
             in the study (e.g., clinically relevant liver dysfunction), plan to undergo a surgical&#xD;
             procedure within 3 days of study entry, or are currently using protease inhibitors&#xD;
             (HIV/AIDS treatment)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  have participated in any other drug trial relating to pain control within one month of&#xD;
             study entry or currently participating in any other study or research project which&#xD;
             would interfere with this trial&#xD;
