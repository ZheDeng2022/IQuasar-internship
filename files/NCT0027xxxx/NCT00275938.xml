  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis B virus (HBV) causes a wide spectrum of liver diseases, such as fulminant or acute&#xD;
      hepatitis, chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The number of&#xD;
      individuals infected with this virus has been estimated to be as high as 350 million. Thus,&#xD;
      in addition to global hepatitis B vaccination, effective treatment of chronic hepatitis B is&#xD;
      also needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there are no effective antiviral treatments to cure HBV infection in patients with&#xD;
      chronic hepatitis B. Five drugs have been approved for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B&#xD;
      at present: conventional interferon (IFN) alpha, lamivudine, adefovir dipivoxil, pegylated&#xD;
      IFN alpha and recently entecavir. Overall, satisfactory virologic and serologic responses&#xD;
      could be achieved using pegylated IFN alpha alone in around 20-44% of these patients.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, better treatment options are still needed for the remaining &gt;50%&#xD;
      non-responders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the best treatment choice for chronic hepatitis B is not clarified yet, certain&#xD;
      therapeutic concepts could be derived from the experience of treating patients with chronic&#xD;
      hepatitis C. A major advancement in treating hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has been the&#xD;
      development of combination therapy with IFN and ribavirin. IFN monotherapy is limited by poor&#xD;
      sustained virologic responses, even when higher doses of IFN are used. IFN plus ribavirin&#xD;
      combination therapy, in contrast, results in much improved treatment outcomes. In our&#xD;
      previous study and others, sustained remission rate after cessation of therapy were&#xD;
      significantly higher in patients receiving combination therapy than those receiving IFN&#xD;
      alone. Therefore, combination therapy with IFN and ribavirin has been recommended as the&#xD;
      standard treatment regimen for chronic hepatitis C. Furthermore, we have used ribavirin and&#xD;
      IFN combination for the treatment of dual chronic hepatitis B and C, and the results also&#xD;
      revealed that the efficacy of clearing HCV RNA was not affected by the presence of HBV&#xD;
      infection. Interestingly, after a little more than 2-year post-treatment follow-up, we found&#xD;
      that a significant portion (21%) of the responsive patients also cleared HBsAg. These&#xD;
      findings imply that this combination regimen might be also effective for the control of&#xD;
      chronic hepatitis B. We thus conducted a randomized, multi-center, placebo-controlled study&#xD;
      in patients with HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B.&#xD;

      at present: conventional interferon (IFN) alpha, lamivudine, adefovir dipivoxil, pegylated&#xD;
      IFN alpha and recently entecavir. Conventional IFN alpha monotherapy has a narrow range of&#xD;
      efficacy. Lamivudine, is relatively cheaper, better tolerated, and has been shown to be&#xD;
      effective in patients with both hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive and -negative chronic&#xD;
      hepatitis B. However, virologic response to lamivudine is not as durable as that occurred&#xD;
      spontaneously or induced by IFN treatment. In addition, prolonged lamivudine treatment is&#xD;
      commonly associated with the emergence of drug-resistance HBV mutants accompanied by the&#xD;
      development of breakthrough hepatitis. Adefovir is potent and has been approved for the&#xD;
      treatment of chronic hepatitis B in several countries, but is nephrotoxic at daily doses&#xD;
      higher than 10 mg and is still not available widely. Entecavir, a carbocyclic deoxyguanosine&#xD;
      analog, which is active against both lamivudine- and adefovir dipivoxil-resistant HBV, is the&#xD;
      most potent anti-HBV agent ever discovered,11 however, its long-term efficacy remains to be&#xD;
      evaluated. Pegylated IFN alpha has recently been shown to be superior to conventional IFN&#xD;
      alpha and lamivudine, and has also been approved for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B.&#xD;
      Overall, satisfactory virologic and serologic responses could be achieved using pegylated IFN&#xD;
      alpha alone in around 30-44% of these patients. Nevertheless, better treatment options are&#xD;
      still needed for the remaining &gt;50% non-responders.&#xD;
