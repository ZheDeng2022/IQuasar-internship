      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the microbiological efficacy, assessed as eradication rate based on&#xD;
           microbiologically evaluable patients 1 month post treatment with oral Levofloxacin 500&#xD;
           mg in male adults with chronic bacterial prostatitis (CBP, category II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the microbiological efficacy, assessed as eradication rate based on&#xD;
           microbiologically evaluable patients 6 months post treatment with oral Levofloxacin 500&#xD;
           mg in male adults with chronic bacterial prostatitis (CBP, category II).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the clinical response rate based on resolution of signs and symptoms after 2&#xD;
           weeks of treatment; 5-12 days, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months post treatment with oral&#xD;
           Levofloxacin 500 mg in male adults with chronic bacterial prostatitis (CBP, category&#xD;
           II).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the safety of Levofloxacin 500 mg on the basis of adverse events, standard&#xD;
           clinical chemistry, hematology, urinalysis and vital signs in male adults with chronic&#xD;
           bacterial prostatitis (CBP, category II).&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  a history of chronic prostatitis as defined as: symptomatic prostatitis (a&#xD;
                  clinical diagnosis of prostatitis having been made for at least one previous&#xD;
                  episode which episode having lasted four weeks or two or more other episodes&#xD;
                  during the previous twelve months) and leucocyturia greater/equal 10 WBC/HPF x&#xD;

             has been receiving must continue throughout the study at the same dose or be&#xD;
             discontinued prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
