      Study Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Daily consumption of almonds over 16 weeks will produce a decrease in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)&#xD;
      levels in adults with pre-diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lay Summary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Persons developing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) will typically first have a condition&#xD;
      called pre-diabetes. Lifestyle is a major factor that determines whether pre-diabetes becomes&#xD;
      full T2DM. Lifestyle includes dietary habits and physical activity. Many people develop T2DM&#xD;
      because of poor dietary habits and a sedentary lifestyle. Moreover, eating a high-fat,&#xD;
      high-sugar diet can damage the blood vessels and increase the risk of strokes and heart&#xD;
      attacks. A person's diet may produce substances in the blood that can interfere with the&#xD;
      production of insulin in the pancreas. Sometimes, these changes in the insulin producing&#xD;
      cells are serious and can eventually interfere with how the cells in the body use blood&#xD;
      sugar, which causes T2DM. Techniques are available to measure circulating substances in the&#xD;
      blood of persons with pre-diabetes that may be associated with the development of T2DM.&#xD;
      Laboratory research has shown that almonds contain high levels of important compounds that&#xD;
      may influence the onset of heart disease and T2DM. A meal plan that includes almonds daily&#xD;
      will be given to half of the study participants and the other participants will be given a&#xD;
      meal plan that is &quot;nut-free&quot;. Because of the potential to delay the onset of heart disease&#xD;
      and T2DM in some persons with pre-diabetes, this 16-week study will collect and analyze blood&#xD;
      samples for changes that may make the person with pre-diabetes more likely to develop heart&#xD;
      disease and T2DM. Blood samples will be collected at weeks 0, 8 and 16 to measure compounds&#xD;
      that may be influenced by consuming almonds daily. This study will also attempt to understand&#xD;
      other possible causes of heart disease and T2DM in persons with pre-diabetes; particularly&#xD;
      those that might be related to body weight and body composition. Body composition techniques&#xD;
      using very small amounts of electrical current are available to study body fat. Body weight,&#xD;
      waist and hip measurements, blood pressure and body composition testing will be performed at&#xD;
      the start of the study and every 4 weeks during the study. Lastly, these other possible&#xD;
      causes of heart disease and T2DM will be investigated to look at relationships with the&#xD;
      substances in the blood.&#xD;
