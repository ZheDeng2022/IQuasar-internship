  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of three diets different in type and&#xD;
      amount of fat in weight maintenance and prevention of life-style diseases in obese subjects.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The obesity epidemic has raised concerns, because of complications such as type 2 diabetes,&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease and certain types of cancer. Much conflict and confusion about the&#xD;
      optimal diet for weight control exists among the public.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current dietary recommendations aim at reducing the total fat in the diet to less than&#xD;
      30% of calories, increasing carbohydrates to 55-60%, and protein from lean meat and dairy&#xD;
      products to 15-20%, and to keep the intake of sugar sweetened soft-drinks limited. There is&#xD;
      good evidence from meta-analyses of intervention studies that a low fat diet can prevent&#xD;
      weight gain in normal weight individuals, induce a small but clinically relevant weight loss&#xD;
      in overweight individuals, and also reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2&#xD;
      diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However this recommended diet may not be of the optimal composition in preventing the&#xD;
      progressive increase in obesity and lifestyle diseases. The traditional dietary&#xD;
      recommendation has been challenged by the epidemiologist Walter Willett, Harvard Medical&#xD;
      School in Boston. He claims that dietary fat is less important for the development of&#xD;
      obesity, and that the fat content of the diet can be 40-45% of the energy providing from&#xD;
      mainly mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids. Based on mainly large-scale observational&#xD;
      studies ('Nurses Health Study') he has developed new dietary guidelines, expressed as a new&#xD;
      diet pyramid. In contrast to the current guidelines, more plant oils and plant foods, limited&#xD;
      animal products, such as meat and dairy products (even lean products), and increased intake&#xD;
      of olive oil, nuts, etc., e.g. guidelines closer to the &quot;Mediterranean Diet&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is circumstantial evidence to support that this moderate fat, MUFA-rich diet will have&#xD;
      a beneficial effect on some of the traditional risk factors for cardiovascular disease and&#xD;
      type-2 diabetes. However, there is also growing concern that the increased total fat content&#xD;
      will lead to weight gain and increased risk of obesity, and secondary to this, type-2&#xD;
      diabetes and cardiovascular disease. This debate has now been taken up by some of the finest&#xD;
      scientific journals. To test this hypothesis the largest and longest dietary intervention&#xD;
      trial in Denmark is carried out at the Department of Human Nutrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective is to identify the diet and diet components most effective for protection&#xD;
      against weight gain, weight regain and prevention of life-style diseases in obese subjects.&#xD;
      The three diets tested are according to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Willetts new dietary recommendations. High in mono unsaturated fat and low in glycemic&#xD;
           index (50 subjects).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The traditional dietary recommendations. Low in fat and medium in glycemic index (50&#xD;
           subjects).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The average Danish diet (Control). High in fat and high in glycemic index (25 subjects).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diets are ad libitum (i.e. no restriction in calorie intake), but very strict in dietary&#xD;
      composition.&#xD;
