  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of two doses of nesiritide&#xD;
      (a recombinant form of the natural human peptide normally secreted by the heart in response&#xD;
      to heart failure) when administered serially as a treatment to outpatients with worsening&#xD;
      congestive heart failure (decompensated CHF) who are receiving their usual cardiac&#xD;
      medications and are at high risk for hospitalization.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Efforts to contain rising costs for hospital acute care have resulted in shorter hospital&#xD;
      stays for patients with acutely decompensated heart failure. These shorter stays may not&#xD;
      allow for adequate diuresis, titration of oral medications, or for patients to receive the&#xD;
      full benefit of intravenously (IV) administered medications. In addition to shorter stays&#xD;
      when hospitalized, physicians are exploring ways to treat patients in the outpatient setting&#xD;
      to avoid hospitalization. Although there is increasing interest among clinicians in the use&#xD;
      of outpatient IV therapy for the treatment of advanced heart failure, there is no consensus&#xD;
      among clinicians regarding patient selection, dosing, or treatment duration. The use of IV&#xD;
      inotropic agents (drugs that influence and or affect muscle contractility) such as milrinone&#xD;
      or dobutamine in this setting is controversial and may lead to increased mortality. Indeed,&#xD;
      the ACC/AHA (American College of Cardiology and American Hospital Association) guidelines&#xD;
      warn that long-term intermittent use of IV inotropes for treatment of left ventricular&#xD;
      dysfunction is of &quot;unproved value and not recommended.&quot; Yet, despite these guidelines,&#xD;
      clinicians use inotropes in the outpatient setting because there is no currently approved&#xD;
      alternative therapy. Thus, there is an unmet need for effective outpatient treatment of&#xD;
      advanced chronic heart failure to improve quality of life and/or reduce the number of&#xD;
      hospital admissions for heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data from previous studies suggest that doses of NATRECOR速 hBNP may be a potent agent for&#xD;
      the treatment of acute congestive heart failure (CHF) with a unique combination of desirable&#xD;
      effects on the flow of blood throughout the body; the hormones secreted by the nervous system&#xD;
      and support of copious salt outputs by the renal system not provided by currently available&#xD;
      therapies. This study is a multicenter, open-label pilot study in which subjects who have&#xD;
      received treatment for acutely decompensated CHF during a hospitalization at least twice&#xD;
      within the previous 12 months are randomized (1:1:1) to one of three treatment groups. One&#xD;
      treatment group will receive their usual long term cardiac medications, either with or&#xD;
      without serial infusions of inotropes (various drugs that affect the strength of contractions&#xD;
      of the heart muscle) and without nesiritide therapy. The 0.005 mcg/kg/min nesiritide&#xD;
      treatment group receives a 0.5 mcg/kg bolus of nesiritide followed by a 0.0025 mcg/kg/min&#xD;
      infusion, in addition to their usual long term cardiac medications, excluding IV inotropes;&#xD;
      The 0.010 mcg/kg/min nesiritide treatment group receives a 1 mcg/kg bolus of nesiritide&#xD;
      followed by a 0.005 mcg/kg infusion, in addition to their usual long term cardiac&#xD;
      medications, excluding IV inotropes. Because patients treated in an outpatient setting may be&#xD;
      less decompensated than patients with acutely decompensated heart failure, this study was&#xD;
      designed to evaluate the 0.010 mcg/kg/min dose of nesiritide (the currently approved dose for&#xD;
      acutely decompensated patients) as well as a lower dose (0.005 mcg/kg/min).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that as an adjunct therapy to oral medications, serial IV infusions of&#xD;
      nesiritide may produce more rapid and sustained compensation of heart failure in patients&#xD;
      with frequent episodes of decompensated heart failure. The 0.005 mcg/kg/min group receives a&#xD;
      0.5 mcg/kg bolus followed by a 0.0025 mcg/kg/min infusion; the 0.010 mcg/kg/min group&#xD;
      receives a 1 mcg/kg bolus followed by a 0.005 mcg/kg infusion. Intravenous bolus over 60&#xD;
      seconds and a fixed rate infusion of 4 - 6 hours, at least once per week for 12 weeks.&#xD;
