      treatment of postpartum depression.&#xD;

      Primary objectives: Remission of Major Depression: To determine the efficacy of a flexibly&#xD;
      titrated dose of Escitalopram (10mg to 20 mg) in the treatment of women with postpartum&#xD;
      depression. The primary outcome measure will be remission of major depression, defined as a&#xD;
      score of 12 or less on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Scale. A score of 7 or less on the&#xD;
      Hamilton Depression Scale (21 item) will be used as a secondary measure of remission. The&#xD;
      null hypothesis is that flexibly dosed Escitalopram does not lead to remission of major&#xD;
      depression based on total MADRS scores after 8 weeks of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine if treatment with Escitalopram is effective in achieving significant&#xD;
           reduction in symptoms of postpartum depression as measured on several instruments: HAM-D&#xD;
           21, CGI, Beck Depression Inventory, Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Specifically,&#xD;
           a response will be defined as a reduction of the total scores of 50% or more from&#xD;
           baseline on the MADRS or HAM-D 21.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the tolerability, safety and some dosing considerations for Escitalopram in&#xD;
           this special subpopulation of depressed patients. Adverse events data (clinical and&#xD;
           laboratory), compliance and early termination will be used as outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine in a post-hoc analysis if pre-study anxiety levels as measured with HAM-A&#xD;
           correlate with primary and secondary outcomes.&#xD;
