      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the&#xD;
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.&#xD;
      Biological therapies, such as GM-CSF, may stimulate the immune system in different ways and&#xD;
      stop tumor cells from growing. Giving paclitaxel together with GM-CSF may be effective in&#xD;
      treating melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving paclitaxel together with GM-CSF&#xD;
      works in treating patients with stage III or stage IV melanoma that cannot be removed by&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the activity of paclitaxel and sargramostim (GM-CSF), in terms of objective&#xD;
           clinical response rate (complete response [CR] and partial response [PR]), in patients&#xD;
           with advanced unresectable melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the duration of response, time to progression, and overall survival of patients&#xD;
           treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine serum cytokine levels (GM-CSF, IFN-γ, aldesleukin, recombinant interleukin-4,&#xD;
           and IL-10) in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1 and sargramostim (GM-CSF) subcutaneously&#xD;
      on days 4-17. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving complete response (CR) receive 2&#xD;
      additional courses of therapy beyond CR for up to 12 courses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After study treatment, patients are followed every 3-6 months for at least 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 42 patients will accrued for this study.&#xD;
