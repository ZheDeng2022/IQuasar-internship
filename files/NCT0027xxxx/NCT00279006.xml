  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the 3 drug-eluting stents presently marketed for intervention in the&#xD;
      coronary artery with respect to the complications that may occur in case it becomes necessary&#xD;
      to retract the stent during the intervention. It has been noted that stents carrying a drug&#xD;
      for local application may be more difficult to retract than the more smooth bare metal&#xD;
      stents.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients in whom DES implantation is planned will be randomized to one of the 3 commercially&#xD;
      available stents (i.e., Cypher, Taxus-Liberté, Endeavor).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sealed envelopes will be used for randomization purposes. Should additional stents be&#xD;
      required in the same patient for the same or other lesions, another stent of the same type of&#xD;
      stents will be implanted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following assessments will be made:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Unblinded subjective operator assessment based on a questionnaire. The questionnaire&#xD;
           will include questions on problems encountered during stent-balloon retrieval, special&#xD;
           maneuvers performed (e.g., retrieval of the catheter during device removal, and possible&#xD;
           complications associated with device retrieval).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blinded measurements of following parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Minimal and maximal distance between the tip of the guiding catheter and the&#xD;
                proximal stent end during stent-balloon retrieval.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Minimal and maximal distance between the tip of the guidewire and the distal&#xD;
                portion of the stent during stent-balloon retrieval.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. To do so the retrieval of the stent-balloon will be documented on ciné-angiography.&#xD;
                The measurements will be performed by a qualified technician/physician blinded to&#xD;
                the type of device used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
           d. In-Hospital mortality, myocardial infarction, or need for unplanned urgent repeat&#xD;
           revascularization.&#xD;
&#xD;
           e. Myocardial infarction defined as creatine kinase MB-isoform [CK-MB] ≥3x upper limit&#xD;
           of normal within 24 hours of the procedure or ≥2x upper limit of normal after 24 hours&#xD;
           of the procedure in the presence of new ischemic symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Target enrollment of 150 patients&#xD;
