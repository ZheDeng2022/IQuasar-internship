      RATIONALE: Pemetrexed disodium may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the&#xD;
      enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well pemetrexed disodium works in treating&#xD;
      patients with recurrent malignant gliomas, primary CNS lymphoma, or brain metastases.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the 6-month progression-free survival rate in patients with recurrent&#xD;
           malignant gliomas treated with pemetrexed disodium.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the time to progression in patients with recurrent malignant gliomas, primary&#xD;
           CNS lymphoma (PCNSL), or brain metastases treated with pemetrexed disodium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the radiographic response in patients with recurrent malignant gliomas, PCNSL,&#xD;
           or brain metastases treated with pemetrexed disodium.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the time to response in patients treated with this drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the duration of response in patients treated with this drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collect safety data on patients with intracranial tumors treated with this drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients receive pemetrexed disodium IV over 10 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat&#xD;
      every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 47 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
