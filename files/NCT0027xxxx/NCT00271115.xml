      The primary objective is to determine if kangaroo holding in the first week after birth&#xD;
      influences the stress levels of mothers who have delivered their infants prematurely and who&#xD;
      require admission to the Special Care Nursery (SCN).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: There will be a decrease in maternal stress levels as perceived by mothers and as&#xD;
      reflected in their blood pressures and heart rates after kangaroo holding their premature&#xD;
      infants in the SCN.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study builds on known observations by previous researchers that the birth and&#xD;
      hospitalization of premature infants creates stressful events in the lives of parents&#xD;
      (Shields-Poe &amp; Pinelli, 1997). The challenge for health care workers is to provide for the&#xD;
      physical and psychological needs of infants within a highly technological setting such as the&#xD;
      SCN. It is necessary to facilitate effective bonding between parents and infants. Effective&#xD;
      bonding is linked with successful parenting role development. Stress can alter the&#xD;
      development of a positive parental role.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kangaroo holding, or skin-to-skin holding, involves placing a diaper clad infant vertical and&#xD;
      prone between a mother's breasts (Affonso, 1993). As evidenced by the literature, stress can&#xD;
      have an altering effect on the maternal attachment role psychologically and place physical&#xD;
      demands on the cardiovascular system. Kangaroo care is one variable that may change the&#xD;
      perception of maternal stress during preterm hospitalization by assisting mothers to gain&#xD;
      control of the parental role, permitting maternal bonding and reducing maternal separation as&#xD;
      well as potentially decreasing the allostatic load as associated with physiologic stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will compare maternal perceived stress levels before and after kangaroo holding&#xD;
      during the first week of life. Mothers who are enrolled in this study will be asked to&#xD;
      Kangaroo hold their infants at least two times during the first week of life. The first&#xD;
      kangaroo hold will take place with the first 48 hours of life. The second kangaroo hold will&#xD;
      take place between day of life five and seven. Mothers may kangaroo hold their infants more&#xD;
      than two times, however this study will only examine the kangaroo holding sessions that take&#xD;
      place at the two times specified above. This study includes both physiologic and psychologic&#xD;
      measurements. Mothers will have their blood pressure and heart rate measured before and after&#xD;
      each of the two kangaroo holding sessions. These mothers will also be asked to complete a&#xD;
      self-report stress inventory scale prior to the first kangaroo holding session (first 48&#xD;
      hours of infant's life) and again after the second kangaroo holding session (infant's day of&#xD;
      life five to seven).&#xD;
