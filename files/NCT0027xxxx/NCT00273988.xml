  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of nevirapine treatment on the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of methadone in HIV-1 infected, opioid-dependent adults who had been on a&#xD;
      stable methadone maintenance therapy for at least five days prior to study entry.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ten HIV-1 infected, opioid-dependent adults on stable methadone treatment were to be enrolled&#xD;
      in this study. This was an open-label, sequential treatment study, with methadone&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics sampling before and after twenty-one (21) days of nevirapine administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients received the same regimen. Methadone was administered in the first treatment&#xD;
      period, and combination treatment of methadone and nevirapine was given in the second&#xD;
      treatment period. In the first period, patients received methadone at their current steady&#xD;
      state dose. In the second period (study days 1-21), they also received nevirapine 200mg qd&#xD;
      (study days 1 to 14) and 200mg bid (study days 15 to 21). Blood samples were taken at the&#xD;
      start of the first treatment period and at the end of the second treatment period for&#xD;
      analysis of methadone and nevirapine pharmacokinetics parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was expected that nevirapine would decrease methadone levels in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study compared methadone steady state exposure in the absence and presence of steady&#xD;
      state nevirapine. A range of pharmacokinetics parameters were assessed including clearance of&#xD;
      methadone (the primary endpoint variable), area under the concentration-time curve, maximum&#xD;
      concentration, time to maximum concentration and minimum concentration (measured for both&#xD;
      methadone and nevirapine).&#xD;

        Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment-naïve, fulfilling standard criteria to commence antiretroviral therapy.&#xD;
             Previous exposure to less than two weeks of nucleoside reverse transcriptase therapy&#xD;
             was permitted. (Later amended to allow previous exposure to non-nucleoside reverse&#xD;
             transcriptase inhibitor therapy (NNRTI) if the patient was off NNRTI therapy for at&#xD;
             least two weeks prior to entry.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Plasma HIV-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA) assay performed at screening documenting HIV-1&#xD;
             infection or previous laboratory documentation of HIV-1 positive status.&#xD;
&#xD;
        CD4+ cell count at least 100 cells/mm3 (later amended to at least 50 cells/mm3), within 28&#xD;
        days prior to study day 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who met the following laboratory parameters:&#xD;
