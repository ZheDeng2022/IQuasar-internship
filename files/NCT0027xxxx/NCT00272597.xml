    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this pilot study is to evaluate the impact of switching 30 subjects&#xD;
      from an existing antipsychotic to risperidone long acting on healthcare resource utilization.&#xD;
      The study will be a ten month open-label, 'mirror-image', pilot study. Healthcare resource&#xD;
      utilization during the 10 months prior to starting risperidone long acting will be&#xD;
      retrospectively collected for all subjects (period A) at the beginning of the study. The&#xD;
      utilization of direct medical resources will also be collected for 10 months after initiation&#xD;
      of risperidone long acting (period B). In this design the patients will serve as their own&#xD;
      control.&#xD;

      Screening (Week -2 to Week 0; Days -14 to -1) In this phase, the subject is required to be&#xD;
      treated with oral risperidone (as their only antipsychotic) for a period of at least 5 days&#xD;
      before entering the stabilization phase of the study. Therefore,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the subject is currently treated with an antipsychotic other than risperidone, the&#xD;
           dosage will be tapered gradually and discontinued. Simultaneously, oral risperidone will&#xD;
           be started at 2 mg/day and increased to no more than 6 mg/day. The subject will be&#xD;
           treated with risperidone monotherapy for at least five days prior to entering the&#xD;
           stabilization phase of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On the other hand, if the patient has already been treated for more than 5 days with&#xD;
           risperidone monotherapy then he/she may enter the stabilization phase of the study&#xD;
           immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stabilization Phase (Weeks 1 - 14; Days 0 - 98) The first three doses of risperidone long&#xD;
      acting (Days 0, 14 and 28) will be 25 mg for all subjects. At the time of the fourth&#xD;
      injection (Day 42), the dosage of risperidone long acting may be increased from 25 mg IM to&#xD;
      37.5 mg IM upon discretion of the treating physician. Further increases in the dosage of&#xD;
      risperidone long acting may be made at the time of the 6th and 8th injections (Days 70 and 98&#xD;
      respectively). In this case, if the subject is currently receiving 25 mg he/she may be&#xD;
      increased to 37.5 mg but not 50 mg. Alternatively, if the patient is currently receiving 37.5&#xD;
      mg, then subject may be increased to the maximum recommended dosage of 50 mg IM every two&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To accommodate for the latency period (i.e., the time for risperidone to be released from the&#xD;
      microspheres and approach therapeutic plasma levels), subjects entering into the study will&#xD;
      continue on oral risperidone for the first three weeks (Days 0-21). Temporary oral&#xD;
      supplementation will also be permitted anytime during the stabilization phase of the study&#xD;
      when considered by the treating physician to be clinically necessary for the treatment of&#xD;
      breakthrough psychosis. With only one exception, the treating physician is not restricted&#xD;
      from adding or discontinuing any pharmacological treatment deemed necessary for the clinical&#xD;
      management of the subject. The exception in this case prohibits the addition of another&#xD;
      antipsychotic agent and applies only to the stabilization phase of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maintenance Phase (Weeks 15 - 38; Days 99 - 266) Patients that have shown adequate response&#xD;
      to risperidone long acting will continue into the maintenance phase of the study. From this&#xD;
      point onwards, the treating physician may change the dosage of risperidone long acting at any&#xD;
      time as considered necessary. Temporary oral supplementation will also be permitted during&#xD;
      the maintenance phase when considered by the treating physician to be clinically necessary&#xD;
      for the treatment of breakthrough psychosis. Apart from the above, the treating physician is&#xD;
      not restricted from adding or discontinuing any pharmacological treatment (including another&#xD;
      antipsychotic) deemed necessary for the clinical management of the subject.&#xD;
