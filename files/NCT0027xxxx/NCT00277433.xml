  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of the study is to investigate the impact of a common genetic polymorphism&#xD;
      in a histamine detoxification enzyme that may well have a common role in regulating the&#xD;
      expression of atopic dermatitis (AD) and other related atopic diseases in children.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common condition in the pediatric population, affecting an&#xD;
      estimated 15% of all children greater than 18 months of age in the United States. It is now&#xD;
      recognized that AD is a disease of significant heterogeneity with respect to both disease&#xD;
      severity and response to conventional pharmacologic therapies. With the recognition of this&#xD;
      variability comes the understanding that, as with many other allergic disease, there exist&#xD;
      many specific disease phenotypes that ultimately govern response to pharmacologic&#xD;
      intervention. The characterization of these unique phenotypes and their associated biologic&#xD;
      mediators is therefore of critical therapeutic importance in the development of disease and&#xD;
      patient-specific treatment strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long term objective of this research is to explore the effects of genetic, environmental&#xD;
      and developmental influences on the primary determinants of histamine action in atopic&#xD;
      children and to identify potential histamine &quot;haplotypes&quot; that may be predictive of disease&#xD;
      severity, progression and/or response to therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypothesis is the presence of HNMT T314 allele and /or slow acetylation genotype&#xD;
      is associated with childhood atopic dermatitis.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Caucasian, Hispanic and African American children ages 6 months to 5 years with a&#xD;
             diagnosis of atopic dermatitis within the last 12 months will constitute the candidate&#xD;
             pool for enrollment into the study group. The diagnosis of atopic dermatitis will be&#xD;
             determined by the presence of at least 3 major diagnostic features (i.e., pruritis,&#xD;
             rash,relapsing-remitting presentation, family history or atopy) in addition to at&#xD;
             least 3 minor features (including but not limited to xerosis, elevated serum IgE,&#xD;
             ocular involvement, food allergy). Healthy Caucasian, Hispanic and African American&#xD;
             children within the same age range will comprise the pool for enrollment into the&#xD;
             control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any child with atopic dermatitis who has a documented history of asthma or&#xD;
             bronchospasm or who is currently receiving treatment for either of these conditions&#xD;
             will be excluded. Any control subject who has asthma or positive family history of&#xD;
             allergy or atopic disease in a first-degree relative (biological mother, father or&#xD;
             siblings) will also be ineligible for enrollment.&#xD;
