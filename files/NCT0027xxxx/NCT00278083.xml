      This trial is a randomised, single-center, placebo-controlled, double blind, parallel group&#xD;
      study in patients with asthma symptomatic on inhaled steroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will examine the efficacy and safety of 5 mg/kg doses of infliximab in patients&#xD;
      with inhaled corticosteroid-dependent asthma. The primary objective of this study is to&#xD;
      obtain pharmacological evidence for a role of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha in&#xD;
      patients with asthma symptomatic on inhaled steroids and to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of repeated intravenous administration of infliximab.&#xD;

      Study Overview This trial is a randomised, single-center, placebo-controlled, double blind,&#xD;
      parallel group study in patients with asthma symptomatic on inhaled steroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Population Patients eligible for this study will have a diagnosis of moderate asthma&#xD;
      defined by the American Thoracic Society criteria for &gt; 1 year. These patients should be&#xD;
      taking inhaled steroids at doses equivalent to &lt;/= 400µg and &lt;/= 2000µg per day&#xD;
      beclomethasone diproprionate but not oral steroid medication. Patients taking additional oral&#xD;
      steroids are required to stop oral medication at least one month prior to pre-screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many of these patients will be receiving long-acting beta2-agonists and this therapy will be&#xD;
      discontinued for 48h before starting the run-in. In addition, the following therapies are not&#xD;
      allowed: 1) anticholinergics; 2) theophylline; 3) oral beta2-agonists; 4) antihistamines; 5)&#xD;
      inhaled cromolyn sodium or nedocromil; 6) leukotriene antagonists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients using these prohibited medications will be asked to discontinue use 2 weeks prior to&#xD;
      the screening examination. During this washout period, patients will keep a clinical diary&#xD;
      and will remain in contact with the clinical research center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients for screening will maintain stable doses of their normal inhaled steroids&#xD;
      in doses equivalent to &gt;/= 400 µg and &lt;/= 2000µg per day beclomethasone diproprionate and&#xD;
      will be able to use short-acting beta2-agonists for symptom relief.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening At screening, eligible patients will have a baseline screening FEV1 of &gt;/= 60 to&#xD;
      &lt;/= 90% of predicted at least 4 hours after the last usage of a short-acting beta2-agonist.&#xD;
      Patients will have reversible airway obstruction: a &gt;/= 12% increase in FEV1 in comparison to&#xD;
      baseline should be shown within 30 minutes after taking 200 µg salbutamol. If airway&#xD;
      reversibility cannot be demonstrated during this visit, patients are eligible for re-testing.&#xD;
      Reversible airway disease may be demonstrated at any time between screening and start of&#xD;
      run-in period. The 2 to 4 week run-in period will start immediately after demonstration of&#xD;
      reversible lung disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will also have skin tests to a standard battery of bronchial allergens performed at&#xD;
      screening. Patients should have both a purified protein derivative (PPD) skin test and a&#xD;
      chest radiograph prior to their first infusion. Patients with evidence of either latent or&#xD;
      active tuberculosis (TB) will not be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Run-in Period Following acceptable screening tests patients will complete a baseline run-in&#xD;
      of 2 to 4 weeks duration prior to the study start. During this period patients will be&#xD;
      required to keep a symptom diary and to record baseline lung function parameters using an&#xD;
      electronic spirometer. As before, patients will be maintained on their normal inhaled&#xD;
      steroids in doses equivalent to &gt;/= 400 µg and &lt;/= 2000µg per day beclomethasone&#xD;
      diproprionate and will be able to use short-acting beta2-agonists for symptom relief. No&#xD;
      other asthma medications will be allowed during this period and the rest of the study. Use of&#xD;
      all other, non-asthma, medication will be reviewed by the Investigator and allowed at his/her&#xD;
      discretion provided a stable dose regimen is maintained where possible throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Visit (day -1) The day before the first drug administration, patients will attend&#xD;
      the clinical research unit and diary cards will be reviewed. In order to enter the study the&#xD;
      patients must have a mean total daily symptom score &gt;/= 4 measured during the last 7 days of&#xD;
      the baseline run-in period [A symptom scale with scores ranging from 0 (=symptom free) to 3&#xD;
      (=severe symptoms) is used, with 6 questions, and a total maximum daily symptom score of 18,&#xD;
      see appendix D)] and/or have a &gt;/= 10% and &lt; 30% diurnal variation in PEFR measured on at&#xD;
      least 2 of 7 days during the same period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diurnal variation in PEFR is defined from morning and evening PEFR values; in the morning and&#xD;
      evening the PEFR is determined on 3 immediately consecutive occasions and the highest value&#xD;
      taken. The calculation of diurnal variation is based on:&#xD;
&#xD;
      [(higher (am or pm) PEFR- lower (am or pm) PEFR) / higher (am or pm) PEFR x 100].&#xD;
&#xD;
      In eligible patients, the following pharmacodynamic assessments will be made: breath NO&#xD;
      levels (non-nasal) and breath condensates, pulmonary function testing (FEV1, FVC and PEFR),&#xD;
      sputum induction for markers of inflammation, and a blood sample collection for the&#xD;
      measurement of markers of inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Treatments Patients will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to treatment with infliximab or&#xD;
      placebo, respectively. PRI will provide the randomisation list. At t=0 weeks, patients will&#xD;
      either receive 5 mg/kg infliximab (Group I, n=20) or placebo (Group II, n=20). Subsequently,&#xD;
      infliximab or placebo will be infused at weeks 2 and 6. Throughout the study period up to&#xD;
      week 12, patients will be allowed to use inhaled corticosteroids at a stable dose regimen.&#xD;
      Salbutamol, a short-acting beta2-agonist, will be allowed as necessary to relieve symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, the two treatment groups are defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group I: Infliximab 5 mg/kg + short-acting beta2-agonist (as needed) + inhaled&#xD;
      corticosteroids (equivalent to &gt;/= 400 µg and &lt;/= 2000µg per day beclomethasone&#xD;
      diproprionate).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group II: Placebo + short-acting beta2-agonist (as needed) + inhaled corticosteroids&#xD;
      (equivalent to &gt;/= 400 µg and &lt;/= 2000µg per day beclomethasone diproprionate).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Evaluations Throughout the study, starting with the baseline run-in period, patients&#xD;
      will be required to daily record their PEFR and FEV1 (morning and evening), short-acting&#xD;
      beta2-agonist use and clinical symptoms using a diary card. Mean weekly scores will be&#xD;
      calculated for each parameter starting at week -1 up to week 12. Prior to administration of&#xD;
      study drug at week 0 and, in addition, at weeks 1, 8 and 12, the following pharmacodynamic&#xD;
      assessments will be made: breath NO levels, breath condensate leukotriene B4 &amp; C4, pulmonary&#xD;
      function testing (FEV1, FVC and PEFR), sputum induction for markers of inflammation (weeks 0,&#xD;
      1 and 8 only) and levels of markers of inflammation in peripheral blood. In addition, at&#xD;
      weeks 2 and 6, breath NO levels will be measured and pulmonary function testing will be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Safety evaluations will include measurement of vital signs during and immediately&#xD;
      after (for 2 hours) the infusion of study medications and assessment of adverse events (AEs)&#xD;
      at each of the evaluation visits. Additional vital signs and lung function measurements will&#xD;
      be performed immediately after each infusion and at t = 1 and 2 hours post dose. Routine&#xD;
      laboratory tests will be performed at screening, at day -1 and at weeks 2, 6, 8 and 12.&#xD;
      During the study, the medical monitor will regularly review safety data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up During the last visit in week 12 to the clinical research center, a follow-up&#xD;
      examination, including a physical examination and blood and urine chemistry will be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
