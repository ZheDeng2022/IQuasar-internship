  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Melanoma is the main cause of death in patients with skin cancer. Once it has metastasized,&#xD;
      this cancer has been shown to respond to chemotherapy only in rare cases. Immunotherapy&#xD;
      represents an approach to treatment based on the immune response to cancer antigens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal objective of the study is to identify whether a dendritic cell-based vaccine&#xD;
      can increase the moderate therapeutic effect of bolus high dose IL-2 in patients with&#xD;
      metastatic melanoma. For this purpose,patients with metastatic melanoma who have a certain&#xD;
      blood type (HLA-A201+) will be treated systemically with high dose IL-2. In one group of&#xD;
      patients, the IL-2 will be preceded by three doses of autologous dendritic cell pulsed with&#xD;
      melanoma antigens appropriate for their blood type. Two cycles of three DC vaccines will be&#xD;
      administered every 14 days by intra-lymph node injections, followed by high dose IL-2&#xD;
      treatment. Responding patients will receive additional DC vaccines at 1 month and 2 months&#xD;
      intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a second group, patients will receive the standard high dose IL-2 protocol within a&#xD;
      comparable period of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each group will include 12 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A complete evaluation of evaluable lesions will be performed prior to accrual, after initial&#xD;
      3 DC vaccines, six weeks after first IL-2 treatment, after a total of 6 DC vaccines and 6&#xD;
      weeks after second cycle of IL-2 treatment.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Any patient age 18 to 65, with measurable metastatic melanoma who has an expected&#xD;
             survival of greater than three months. All patients will be HLA-A2 positive&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patient must have received accepted standard treatmnet for melanoma - DTIC&#xD;
                  -containing protocol ,unless unwilling.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients who failed previous treatment with IL-2 will be included on a&#xD;
                  compassionate basis in the IL-2 plus vaccination scheme without being included in&#xD;
                  the analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. serum creatinine of 2.0 mg/dl or less,&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Total bilirubin 1.6 mg/dl or less, except for patients with Gilbert's Syndrome who&#xD;
             must have a total bilirubin less than 3.0 mg/dl.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. WBC 3000/mm3 or greater&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. platelet count 90,000 mm3 or greater&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. serum AST/ALT less then two times normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. ECOG performance status of 0, 1 or 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients of both genders must be willing to practice effective birth control during&#xD;
             this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patient agreed to participate in the study and has signed a written informed consent,&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. The patient must be eligible to receive IL-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will be excluded:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. who are undergoing or have undergone in the past 3 weeks any other form of therapy&#xD;
             except from surgery for their cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. have active systemic infections, coagulation disorders, autoimmune disease or other&#xD;
             major medical illnesses of the cardiovascular or respiratory systems or any known&#xD;
             immunodeficiency disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. who require steroid therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. who are pregnant (because of possible side effects on the fetus).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. who are known to be positive for hepatitis BsAG, HCV, or HIV antibody (because of&#xD;
             possible immune effects of these conditions).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. who have any form of primary or secondary immunodeficiency. (The experimental&#xD;
             treatment being evaluated in this protocol depends on an intact immune system.&#xD;
             Patients who have decreased immune competence may be less responsive to the&#xD;
             experimental treatment and more susceptible to its toxicities.)&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        i. who have an active major medical illnesses such as cardiac ischemia as evidenced by a&#xD;
        stress thallium or comparable test, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmias, obstructive&#xD;
        or restrictive pulmonary disease (to be eligible to receive IL-2 ) j. Have an abnormal&#xD;
        thyroid function (to be eligible to receive IL-2).&#xD;
