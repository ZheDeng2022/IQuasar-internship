      Background Clonidine, a derivate of Imidazol, is an antihypertensive drug. It acts by&#xD;
      stimulating adrenergic receptors on nerves in the brain and Imidazol-receptors. As a result,&#xD;
      clonidine slows the heart rate and reduces blood pressure. Clonidine was approved by the FDA&#xD;
      in 1974 and is registered in Austria with the brand name &quot;Catapresan&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alpha2 adrenergic agonists are nowadays used topically as eye drops in glaucoma treatment. In&#xD;
      addition to their known effect of lowering intraocular pressure, alpha2 adrenoceptor agonists&#xD;
      are neuroprotective. Brimonidine, which is the most commonly used topical alpha-2 agonist, is&#xD;
      currently on the market for treatment of glaucoma and is effective in reducing intraocular&#xD;
      pressure. It has, however, been shown that brimonidine is a very potent vasoconstrictor in&#xD;
      the ciliary body thus reducing aqueous humor production. Little is, however, known about&#xD;
      potential vasoconstrictor effects of brimonidine in the posterior pole of the eye. This is of&#xD;
      clinical importance, because optic nerve head ischemia appears to contribute to glaucoma&#xD;
      pathophysiology. Direct investigation of the ocular hemodynamic effects of brimonidine is,&#xD;
      however, difficult, because lowering intraocular pressure with brimonidine may confound the&#xD;
      results due to the concomitant change in ocular perfusion pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is to assess the effect of intravenous clonidine as model drug&#xD;
      of alpha agonists on ocular blood flow and IOP in healthy humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate effects of clonidine on ocular blood flow and intraocular pressure.&#xD;
