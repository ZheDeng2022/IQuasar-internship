      After completing all screening evaluations, subjects will receive unblinded N-Acetyl Cysteine&#xD;
      600 mg/day for 2 weeks. The dose will be raised to 1200 mg/day at visit 4 and to 1800 mg/day&#xD;
      at visit 6 unless clinical improvement has been attained at a lower dose (clinical&#xD;
      improvement will be assessed by the investigator with respect to gambling thoughts, urges and&#xD;
      behavior). If it is clinically necessary to modify this schedule (e.g., because of side&#xD;
      effects or an adequate response to a lower dose), the dose will be raised more slowly or the&#xD;
      target dose will not be reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will start no other psychotropic medications during the study but may continue on&#xD;
      previously prescribed psychotropic medications if on a stable dose for 3 months prior to&#xD;
      study entry. Psychotherapy of any form (including cognitive-behavioral therapy) will not be&#xD;
      initiated during the study but subjects may continue with current psychotherapy if they have&#xD;
      been undergoing therapy for at least three months prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be evaluated with the PG-YBOCS, G-SAS, CGI, HAM-D, HAM-A and the Sheehan&#xD;
      Disability Inventory at screening and at each visit for the remainder of the study.&#xD;
      Medication side effects will be evaluated at each study visit. A tablet count will be kept&#xD;
      for each dose of medication taken.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Before beginning N-Acetyl Cysteine, all subjects will receive a psychiatric, medical, and&#xD;
      family history evaluation as well as the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID-P)&#xD;
      for Axis I disorders. At the screening visit, patients will also receive standard laboratory&#xD;
      tests (including ÃŸ-HCG), and a physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following instruments will be completed at the screening visit and periodically&#xD;
      throughout the study: 1) Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale Modified for Pathological&#xD;
      Gambling (PG-YBOCS), a reliable and valid semi-structured clinician-administered scale that&#xD;
      assesses current severity of PG; 2) Gambling Symptom Assessment Scale (G-SAS), a reliable and&#xD;
      valid self-report measure of gambling symptoms; 3) the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for&#xD;
      Depression (HAM-D); 4) the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A); 5) Clinical&#xD;
      Global Impression scale; 6) the Sheehan Disability Inventory; and 7) the Quality of Life&#xD;
      Inventory. Safety evaluations, including pulse and blood pressure, and assessment of side&#xD;
      effects will be done at each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completing all screening evaluations, subjects will receive unblinded N-Acetyl Cysteine&#xD;
      600 mg/day for 2 weeks. The dose will be raised to 1200 mg/day at visit 4 and to 1800 mg/day&#xD;
      at visit 6 unless clinical improvement has been attained at a lower dose (clinical&#xD;
      improvement will be assessed by the investigator with respect to gambling thoughts, urges and&#xD;
      behavior). If it is clinically necessary to modify this schedule (e.g., because of side&#xD;
      effects or an adequate response to a lower dose), the dose will be raised more slowly or the&#xD;
      target dose will not be reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will start no other psychotropic medications during the study but may continue on&#xD;
      previously prescribed psychotropic medications if on a stable dose for 3 months prior to&#xD;
      study entry. Psychotherapy of any form (including cognitive-behavioral therapy) will not be&#xD;
      initiated during the study but subjects may continue with current psychotherapy if they have&#xD;
      been undergoing therapy for at least three months prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be evaluated with the PG-YBOCS, G-SAS, CGI, HAM-D, HAM-A and the Sheehan&#xD;
      Disability Inventory at screening and at each visit for the remainder of the study.&#xD;
      Medication side effects will be evaluated at each study visit. A tablet count will be kept&#xD;
      for each dose of medication taken.&#xD;
