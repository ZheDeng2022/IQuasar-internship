  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this protocol is to allow for the careful evaluation of healthy volunteers and&#xD;
      individuals with risk for psychiatric disorders or neurodevelopmental disorders, such as&#xD;
      autism spectrum disorder. The evaluations may be used to determine if the participant meets&#xD;
      criteria for participation in research protocols at the National Institute of Mental Health&#xD;
      (NIMH) and other collaborative investigations. Since the entry criteria for these protocols&#xD;
      vary, the screening evaluations will also vary. Behavioral evaluations will also be done&#xD;
      through this protocol for individuals participating in IRB-approved protocols being conducted&#xD;
      by collaborating scientists at NIH. The evaluations might include: a psychiatric interview; a&#xD;
      diagnostic interview; developmental and/or cognitive testing; ratings of other psychiatric&#xD;
      symptoms; neuropsychological testing; a medical history; a physical exam; blood; and a&#xD;
      request for medical records. Parents of minors will be interviewed.&#xD;

      (PDN) at the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) and other collaborative&#xD;
      investigations. This protocol will be the entry point for PDN investigations. Since the entry&#xD;
