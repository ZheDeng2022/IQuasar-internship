      This is a multicenter study conducted at study sites in Russia and the Ukraine where various&#xD;
      doses of ABI-007 (Abraxane) will be given in combination with carboplatin to patients with&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer to determine the recommended dose and schedule for this&#xD;
      combination therapy for Phase III trials. The primary objective of this study is to obtain&#xD;
      preliminary information on the antitumor activity and adverse events of ABI-007 in&#xD;
      combination with carboplatin.&#xD;
