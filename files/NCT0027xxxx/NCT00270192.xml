  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial addresses the impact of simple antenatal breastfeeding&#xD;
      educational interventions on breastfeeding rates and practice in a tertiary hospital setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: A single antenatal encounter, which includes breastfeeding educational material&#xD;
      and individual instruction with a lactation counselor, can improve the initiation, duration&#xD;
      and exclusivity of breastfeeding compared to routine antenatal care or the use of educational&#xD;
      material alone&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breastfeeding rates in many developed countries, particularly in terms of exclusive and&#xD;
      predominant breastfeeding, often fall short of the recommended practice advised by the World&#xD;
      Health Organization and the American Academy of Pediatrics. Despite increasing awareness of&#xD;
      the many advantages of breastfeeding the challenge remains to implement programs that can&#xD;
      effectively improve short and long-term breastfeeding rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Singapore National Breastfeeding Survey 2001 (Foo et al, 2005) demonstrated an&#xD;
      encouraging breastfeeding initiation rate of 94.5%. However only 21.1% continued to&#xD;
      breastfeed at 6 months with fewer than 5% breastfeeding exclusively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The formal preparation of expectant mothers for breastfeeding is not part of routine&#xD;
      antenatal care in many practices. We feel that it may prove beneficial especially in an&#xD;
      environment with a low prevalence of breastfeeding. The aim of this trial is to demonstrate&#xD;
      the impact of single-encounter antenatal education combining educational material with&#xD;
      individual instruction, on breastfeeding initiation and duration and on infant feeding&#xD;
      practice, compared with routine antenatal care and educational material alone in a tertiary&#xD;
      hospital setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      401 women are randomized into 3 predetermined groups and are exposed to specific antenatal&#xD;
      education materials targeting breastfeeding techniques; the control group receives routine&#xD;
      antenatal care. Data regarding breastfeeding rate, quality and duration is collected over a 1&#xD;
      year period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparisons: breastfeeding initiation rate, duration and type among women receiving lactation&#xD;
      counseling with educational material, educational material without individual counseling, and&#xD;
      routine antenatal care without educational intervention&#xD;
