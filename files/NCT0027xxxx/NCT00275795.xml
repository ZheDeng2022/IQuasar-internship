  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Food allergy reactions cause various health disorders in sensitive people. These reactions&#xD;
      may be IgE-mediated,cell-mediated, energy disturbance-mediated, or a combination of the&#xD;
      three. Certain laboratory diagnostic procedures have been able to identify most IgE-mediated&#xD;
      or cell-mediated food reactions, but so far there is no test available in traditional&#xD;
      medicine to test the energy-mediated allergies and sensitivities. NAET速 procedures have been&#xD;
      able to identify food substances triggering to energ disturbances in sensitive people causing&#xD;
      related health disorders. NAET uses one of the testing procedures called NST (Neuromuscular&#xD;
      sensitivity testing).The efficacy of NST-NAET to screen food sensitivity will be evaluated in&#xD;
      comparison with one of the well accepted, established, traditional medicine allergy testing&#xD;
      known as the IgE-specific antigen test.&#xD;

      Forty-two volunteers responded for an advertisement posted on the NAET web site and in the&#xD;
      community college news bulletin board inviting them to take part in the study. They were&#xD;
      asked to complete the NAET速 Allergy Symptom-Rating (ASR) questionnaire upon arrival at the&#xD;
      research center. Observing inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total of 32 subjects from both&#xD;
      sexes with varied health problems were selected out of the forty-two who volunteered for the&#xD;
      study. All 32 subjects were tested for 21 commonly used food substances via NST. Out of 32&#xD;
      tested, 26 subjects tested positive for one item each, from the 21 items tested and six&#xD;
      subjects tested positive for multiple items from the selected food list. The 32 subjects had&#xD;
      a total of 50 positive NSTs out of 672 (21X32) tests performed. The items that produced&#xD;
      positive results by NST were further evaluated via laboratory blood serum analysis for&#xD;
      IgE-specific antigens. According to NST the percentage of observed total food reactions in&#xD;
      this group of 32 was 7.44%. Soon after the completion of NST the laboratory technicians&#xD;
      collected blood from 32 subjects for IgE-specific antigen study on 50 positively tested&#xD;
      items. The IgE-specific antigen tests were found positive on a total of 49 out of 50 tests&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
