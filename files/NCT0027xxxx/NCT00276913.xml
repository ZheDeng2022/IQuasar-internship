      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the safety, toxicity and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of intravenous&#xD;
           STA-5312 when administered weekly (3 of 4 weeks) to subjects with advanced or metastatic&#xD;
           solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the pharmacokinetics of STA-5312.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To assess antitumor activity of STA-5312 administration.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I open-label, dose-escalation safety study in subjects with refractory non&#xD;
      hematologic malignancies. STA-5312 will be administered intravenously. Administration is&#xD;
      anticipated to take 1 hour, although infusion time may be extended when appropriate with&#xD;
      large infusion volumes. A treatment cycle is 4 weeks with a weekly infusion of STA 5312 for&#xD;
      the first 3 weeks of each 4 week cycle. The planned treatment schedule is 2 cycles of&#xD;
      STA-5312 treatment (8 weeks). Decisions regarding dose escalation and DLT determination will&#xD;
      be made based on observations during the first cycle of therapy. Subjects who tolerate&#xD;
      treatment may be eligible to continue receiving additional cycles of STA 5312 per the&#xD;
      investigator's medical judgment. Evaluation of antitumor response will be performed after&#xD;
      every 2 cycles of STA 5312 administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial dose level of STA 5312 will be 6 mg/m2. The starting dose level was chosen based&#xD;
      on preclinical animal studies that used alternate day dosing x 3/week on alternate weeks. The&#xD;
      dose level of 6 mg/m2 represents less than 1/10 the weekly dose (3 mg/m2 x 3) that&#xD;
      demonstrated severe toxicity. Subsequent dose escalations will follow an accelerated&#xD;
      titration design once the 8 mg/m2 cohort is completed No fewer than 3 patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled at each dose level. Once a DLT is observed the cohort will be expanded to at least&#xD;
      six subjects. If one-third of at least 6 subjects treated at a dose level experience a DLT,&#xD;
      dose escalation will terminate. The dose below this will be considered the MTD and will be&#xD;
      expanded to at least 12 subjects to collect additional safety and pharmacokinetic data. No&#xD;
      intrasubject dose escalations will occur.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Male and female subjects aged at least 18 years with histologically-confirmed non&#xD;
             hematological malignancy that is metastatic or unresectable and for which no standard&#xD;
             therapy exists.&#xD;

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance status of 0-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Peripheral neuropathy less than Grade 2 on National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity&#xD;
             Criteria (NCI CTC) version 3 adverse event scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have acceptable organ and marrow function during the Screening Period as&#xD;
             defined below. (Note: Subjects must meet these criteria at each pre-dose visit to&#xD;
             receive additional doses of STA-5312).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than 1500 cells/µL&#xD;
