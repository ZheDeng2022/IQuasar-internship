      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of a new approach to a normalization of eating&#xD;
      program, based on principles of cognitive-behavioral therapy, in treating women with anorexia&#xD;
      nervosa or bulimia nervosa.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eating disorders are real, treatable medical illnesses. They are often characterized by&#xD;
      disturbances in eating behavior, such as drastic reduction of food intake or extreme&#xD;
      overeating, as well as feelings of distress or extreme concern about body shape or weight.&#xD;
      The two main types of eating disorders are anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. A third&#xD;
      type, binge-eating disorder, is pending approval as a formal psychiatric diagnosis. Eating&#xD;
      disorders frequently develop during adolescence or early adulthood, and they occur more often&#xD;
      in females than in males. Studies have shown cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to be the&#xD;
      most effective approach to treating eating disorders. However, the applicability of these&#xD;
      findings to clinical settings and intensive outpatient therapy programs (IOPs) remains&#xD;
      unknown. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of a new approach to a normalization of&#xD;
      eating (NOE) program, based on principles of CBT, in treating women with anorexia nervosa or&#xD;
      bulimia nervosa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this open-label study will be assigned to receive either treatment-as-usual&#xD;
      (TAU) or NOE. Participants admitted to the study in the first 8 months of the trial will&#xD;
      receive TAU. Those admitted after the first 8 months will take part in the NOE program.&#xD;
      Participants may begin receiving treatment as soon as they enter the study and will continue&#xD;
      receiving their assigned treatments for 6 weeks. All participants in the NOE group will be&#xD;
      required to report to the study site three evenings a week. They will receive individual&#xD;
      therapy, as well as take part in group and family therapy sessions. In addition, they will be&#xD;
      supervised while eating a meal. Body weight, results of the Eating Disorders Examination and&#xD;
      the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I disorders, and self-report measures will&#xD;
      be assessed post-treatment and at the Month 6 follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note: Participants are recruited from the Renfrew Center's outpatient programs located in the&#xD;
      Philadelphia area. Individuals outside of Renfrew cannot volunteer for this study. For more&#xD;
      information about the Renfrew Center's inpatient or outpatient treatment programs, please&#xD;
