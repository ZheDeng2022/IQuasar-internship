    <textblock>
      Patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia are included Half of the patients are&#xD;
      treated with a 3 day course of intravenous antibiotics, followed, when clinical stable, by a&#xD;
      course of oral antibiotics. Efficacy of this treatment is compared to a standard course of 7&#xD;
      days of intravenous antibiotics, which treatment is assigned to the other half of patients.&#xD;
      Outcomes measured are clinical cure and costs.&#xD;

      Study design A multi-center, randomized open label clinical trial was performed in 2&#xD;
      university medical centers and 5 teaching hospitals in the Netherlands. The study was&#xD;
      approved by the medical ethics committees of all participating hospitals and all patients&#xD;
      provided written informed consent prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After inclusion in the trial, treatment allocation was established through an independent&#xD;
      central randomization center. Stratified randomization per center was based on computer&#xD;
      generated tables. Patients were either randomized to the intervention group, where clinically&#xD;
      stable patients were switched from IV to oral antibiotics on the 3rd day of hospitalization&#xD;
      to complete a total of 10 days antibiotic treatment, or to the control group, who received a&#xD;
      standard regimen of 7 days of intravenous therapy. Clinical stability was defined as&#xD;
      respiratory rate &lt; 25/min, O2 saturation &gt; 90% or arterial pO2&gt;55mmHg, hemodynamically&#xD;
      stable, &gt; 1oC decrease in temperature in case of fever, absent mental confusion and the&#xD;
      ability to take oral medication 10. Antibiotic choices were left to the discretion of the&#xD;
      attending consultant and were based on Dutch treatment guidelines 20.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients Adult patients (age 18 or above) with severe CAP admitted to general hospital wards&#xD;
      were eligible for inclusion in the study. Pneumonia was defined as a new or progressive&#xD;
      infiltrate on a chest X-ray plus at least two of the following criteria: cough, sputum&#xD;
      production, rectal temperature &gt; 38oC or &lt; 36.1oC, auscultatory findings consistent with&#xD;
      pneumonia, leucocytosis (&gt;10.000/mm3, or &gt;15% bands), C-reactive protein &gt; 3 times the upper&#xD;
      limit of normal, positive blood culture or positive culture of pleural fluid. 21 Severe&#xD;
      pneumonia was defined as Fine class IV or V or fulfilling the ATS-criteria for severe&#xD;
      community-acquired pneumonia. 16;22 Patients with cystic fibrosis, a history of colonization&#xD;
      with Gram negative bacteria due to structural damage to the respiratory tract, malfunction of&#xD;
      the digestive tract, life expectancy of less than 1 month due to underlying diseases,&#xD;
      infections other than pneumonia needing antibiotic treatment, severe immunosuppression&#xD;
      (neutropenia (&lt;0,5 x 109 / l) or a CD4 count &lt; 200 / mm3) and needing mechanical ventilation&#xD;
      in an intensive care unit were excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline, follow up and outcome measurements Patients were followed for a maximum of 28 days.&#xD;
      On admission, a complete physical examination, chest radiography and blood sampling for&#xD;
      arterial blood gas analysis and for hematological and biochemical analysis were performed.&#xD;
      Demographic data, initial intravenous therapy and clinical data were recorded. During the&#xD;
      follow-up period, in-hospital clinical data were recorded. Clinical stability was evaluated&#xD;
      after 3 days of intravenous therapy in both study groups and discharge criteria (temperature&#xD;
      &lt; 37.8 oC, saturation &gt;92%, normal blood pressure, heart rate &lt; 100/min, respiratory rate &lt;&#xD;
      25/min, absence of mental confusion and ability to take oral medication ) were evaluated&#xD;
      daily thereafter. If patients were discharged within 28 days after admission they were asked&#xD;
      to return to the out-patient clinic 28 days after inclusion, where history, physical&#xD;
      examination, blood chemistry analysis and a chest X-ray were taken and health-care&#xD;
      consumption after discharge was recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires were used to evaluate the effects on health care resource use outside the&#xD;
      hospital (recorded daily after discharge). Quality of life was determined with the short form&#xD;
      health survey questionnaire (www.sf-36.org) recorded at days 3, 10 and 28 of the study.&#xD;
      Additional questionnaires were used to measure the effects of an early discharge on the&#xD;
      workload for family members (questionnaire at day 28 of study) and effects of administration&#xD;
      route on freedom of movement, adverse events and compliance (questionnaire at day 7 of&#xD;
      study). Treatment failures were defined as death, clinical deterioration (clinical worsening&#xD;
      such that the patient needed mechanical ventilation, re-administration of intravenous&#xD;
      antibiotics after a switch to oral therapy, readmission for pulmonary reinfection after&#xD;
      discharge, increase in temperature after initial improvement) or hospitalization at day 28 of&#xD;
      the study. Clinical cure was defined as discharged in good health without signs and symptoms&#xD;
      of pneumonia and no treatment failures during the follow-up period. 21&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microbiological analyses Sputum samples and blood samples were collected, cultured and&#xD;
      evaluated following standard procedures. Micro-organisms cultured in blood or sputum were&#xD;
      recorded. In addition, Binax NOW-tests were used to detect urinary antigen for Legionella&#xD;
      pneumophila and S. pneumoniae. Acute and convalescent serology samples were collected and&#xD;
      evaluated for Mycoplasma pneumoniae, L. pneumophila and Chlamydia pneumonia. Any&#xD;
      non-contaminating micro-organism cultured from a blood or sputum sample or detected by&#xD;
      urinary antigen testing was considered a cause for the episode of pneumonia. For Mycoplasma&#xD;
      pneumoniae, a fourfold or greater increase in titer in paired sera or a single titer of&#xD;
      greater than or equal to 1:40 was considered indicative of infection. 23 (Immune fluorescence&#xD;
      agglutination, Serodia-MycoII Â®, Fujirebio, inc.) For Legionella pneumophila, a fourfold&#xD;
      increase in the antibody titer to 1:128 or greater, or single titers of 1:256 or more were&#xD;
      considered suggestive of Legionella pneumonia.24 For Chlamydia pneumoniae, detection of IgM&#xD;
      above established values, seroconversion of IgG between acute and convalescence samples, high&#xD;
      amounts of IgG in single titers or a combination of these factors were considered serological&#xD;
      evidence of infection, according to the manufacturers instructions. (ELISA, Savyon&#xD;
      Diagnostics Ltd)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Economic evaluation The societal perspective was used to calculate direct medical costs&#xD;
      associated with the treatment in both study groups. Costs were assessed in 2002 euros. Costs&#xD;
      per patient were calculated by multiplying resource use by the unit costs. Resource use&#xD;
      during hospital stay for diagnostic and therapeutic interventions, consultations of medical&#xD;
      or paramedic specialists and antibiotic use was measured. Resource use outside the hospital&#xD;
      was evaluated using questionnaires which recorded contacts with general practitioners,&#xD;
      specialists, extra diagnostic procedures, use of medication, readmissions, home care and&#xD;
      other disease-related costs. Additional costs associated with specific diagnostic tests were&#xD;
      based on tariffs. Costs of hospital stay, diagnostic procedures and specialist consultations,&#xD;
      were calculated using unit costs as determined within the realm of the Dutch guidelines for&#xD;
      pharmaco-economic analyses 25. Costs for readmissions and reinfections were assessed&#xD;
      specifically for the study cohort and included costs for extra diagnostic procedures,&#xD;
      treatment and hospitalizations. Costs of antibiotics prescribed were estimated using Dutch&#xD;
      2002 formulary cost-prices 26&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size and statistical analysis To demonstrate equivalence in efficacy of the two&#xD;
      treatment groups, initially, the sample size was set at 250 patients in each study group&#xD;
      based on an expected cure rate of 85% in the IV group and acceptance of a 75% cure rate in&#xD;
      the switch group. (ï¡=0.05, 2 sided; 1-ï¢=0.80). The absolute difference in cure rate including&#xD;
      95% CI was calculated. Equivalence was rejected if the lower limit of the CI exceeded -10%.&#xD;
      Eventually, with less than anticipated enrolment, a 15% lower effectiveness in the&#xD;
      intervention group could be excluded with ï¡=0.05 and 1-ï¢=0.80.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis. Differences in continuous variables&#xD;
      were presented as absolute differences with their corresponding 95% CIÂ´s. Dichotomous data&#xD;
      were compared with chi-square statistics. Alike cure rate differences in proportions were&#xD;
      presented including 95% CIÂ´s. For cost-calculations, arithmetic means of both study groups&#xD;
      were compared. The uncertainty surrounding the cost-calculations was evaluated by means of&#xD;
      standard bootstrap techniques. 27 Ultimately, the balance between costs and effects was&#xD;
      compared for both strategies and incremental costs per therapy failure averted at 28 days&#xD;
      were calculated. The uncertainty surrounding the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was&#xD;
      again evaluated by means of bootstrapping.&#xD;
