      Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine non-inferiority of FITpatch with regard to efficacy compared to standard&#xD;
           opioid treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the safety of FITpatch compared to standard opioid treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the intake of oral morphine as rescue analgesic to FITpatch compared to&#xD;
           standard opioid treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess Quality of life reported with FITpatch compared to standard opioid treatment&#xD;
