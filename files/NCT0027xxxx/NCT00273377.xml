      The investigators will test the hypotheses that mild hypercapnia and supplemental oxygen&#xD;
      reduce wound infection risk in patients undergoing colon resection. The investigators will&#xD;
      simultaneously test the hypothesis that low-dose dexamethasone (a common treatment for&#xD;
      postoperative nausea and vomiting) does not increase infection risk.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Wound infections are common and serious complications of anesthesia and surgery. Even in&#xD;
      patients who are kept normothermic and given supplemental oxygen, the incidence of wound&#xD;
      infection after colon resection exceeds 5%. About 80% of these resections are done for colon&#xD;
      cancer, the third leading cause of cancer death. The average surgical wound infection&#xD;
      prolongs hospitalization by a week and substantially increases cost. Major factors&#xD;
      influencing the incidence of surgical wound infection include the site and complexity of&#xD;
      surgery, underlying illness (including treatment with immunosuppressive drugs), timely&#xD;
      administration of prophylactic antibiotics, intraoperative patient temperature, hypovolemia,&#xD;
      and tissue oxygen tension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary defense against surgical pathogens is oxidative killing by neutrophils. Oxygen is&#xD;
      a substrate for this process, and the reaction critically depends on tissue oxygen tension&#xD;
      throughout the observed physiological range. It is therefore unsurprising that subcutaneous&#xD;
      tissue oxygen tension (PsqO2) is inversely correlated with the risk of surgical wound&#xD;
      infection. Primary determinants of tissue oxygen availability include arterial oxygen&#xD;
      tension, hemoglobin concentration, and local perfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An additional determinant of peripheral oxygen delivery is cardiac output. Mild hypercapnia&#xD;
      increases cardiac output: for example, augmenting arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2)&#xD;
      just 10-12 mmHg increases the cardiac index 15%. Our preliminary studies confirm that mild&#xD;
      hypercapnia increases cardiac output and additionally indicate the hypercapnia markedly&#xD;
      improves tissue oxygenation. For example, tissue oxygen tension increased 16 mmHg, from 58 to&#xD;
      74 mmHg over a 20 mmHg range of PaCO2 in anesthetized volunteers. We have also shown that&#xD;
      increasing PaCO2 by just 15 mmHg increased tissue oxygen tension 16 mmHg in surgical&#xD;
      patients. Similar results were observed in morbidly obese patients. Previous work indicates&#xD;
      that similar increases in PsqO2 reduces the risk of surgical wound infection by about 30%. We&#xD;
      thus propose to test the hypothesis that mild hypercapnia significantly reduces the incidence&#xD;
      of surgical wound infection in normothermic patients undergoing colon resection. Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes will include the duration of hospitalization, cost of care, the incidence of&#xD;
      nosocomial pneumonia, the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) and return to&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High intra- and postoperative oxygen concentration (80%, as opposed to 30% oxygen) has been&#xD;
      shown to reduce the rate of wound infection by more than 50%. Therefore, the protocol&#xD;
      implemented high intraoperative oxygen concentrations for all patients this trial. However,&#xD;
      within the first 500 enrolled patients a recent trial reported a better outcome for patients&#xD;
      with low perioperative oxygen concentrations. Although that trial was less well controlled&#xD;
      and underpowered, the conflicting evidence indicates that additional study is needed. We will&#xD;
      therefore simultaneously test the hypothesis that supplemental oxygen reduces infection risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergoing colon surgery are generally at high risk for postoperative nausea and&#xD;
      vomiting (PONV). According to results from meta-analyses, a single intraoperative dose of&#xD;
      dexamethasone is effective and safe for the prophylaxis for PONV. Dexamethasone has thus been&#xD;
      recommended as a first-line prophylaxis for PONV. However, none of the previous PONV trials&#xD;
      have focused on wound infections nor had a sufficiently long observational period to rule out&#xD;
      potential concerns of an increased incidence of wound infection. We will therefore also test&#xD;
      the hypothesis that dexamethasone does not increase the risk of surgical wound infection. The&#xD;
      second and third hypotheses will be added to the protocol, using a factorial design, after&#xD;
      the first 500 patients are enrolled.&#xD;
