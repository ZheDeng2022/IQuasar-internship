      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary study objective is to compare efficacy of Insulin glulisine, once a day at&#xD;
      breakfast vs. Insulin glulisine given once a day at main meal in combination with insulin&#xD;
      glargine + OAD in terms of change in HbA1c, from baseline to endpoint for the individual&#xD;
      patient. The aim of the study is to demonstrate two-sided equivalence between the two therapy&#xD;
      regimens receiving two different injection timing of Insulin glulisine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary study objectives are to compare efficacy and safety of Insulin glulisine, once a&#xD;
      day at breakfast vs. Insulin glulisine given once a day at main meal in combination with&#xD;
      insulin glargine + OAD in terms of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change of fasting-, pre-/2h-postprandial-, mean daily and nocturnal blood glucose&#xD;
           (baseline to endpoint)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change of fasting plasma glucose (baseline to endpoint)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Response rate: Responders will be those patients with HbA1c smaller than 7.0% at study&#xD;
           endpoint&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Insulin dose (rapid-acting, basal and total daily doses)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weight, body-mass index&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypoglycemic events&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse events&#xD;

        Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Type 2 Diabetes mellitus, previously treated with combination therapy of insulin&#xD;
             glargine + OAD (maximal tolerated dose / approved in combination with insulin&#xD;
             according to local SPCs (Summary of Product Characteristics), not including use of&#xD;
             a-glucosidase inhibitors) for at least 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pre-screening HbA1c value greater/equal 7% - smaller/equal 9%&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  FBG (Fasting Blood Glucose) smaller/equal 120 mg/dl (6.6 mmol/l)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women are either not of childbearing potential (surgically sterile, or postmenopausal&#xD;
             for more than 2 years) or are not pregnant and agree to use a reliable contraceptive&#xD;
