      The Frequent Hemodialysis (FHN) Nocturnal Trial is a randomized controlled trial recruiting&#xD;
      subjects from dialysis units associated with designated Clinical Centers in the U.S. and&#xD;
      Canada and followed for 12 months. Subjects will be randomized to conventional hemodialysis&#xD;
      delivered three days per week home arm or to the six times per week nocturnal home&#xD;
      hemodialysis arm which will follow any dialysis prescription provided their prescribed&#xD;
      standardized Kt/V is at least 4.0 and treatment time is at least 6.0 hours, six times per&#xD;
      week.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This trial is a randomized, unblinded study of six times per week nocturnal home hemodialysis&#xD;
      versus three times per week home hemodialysis. A target of 150 patients will be enrolled into&#xD;
      this study with equal allocation in each arm, stratified by Clinical Center and residual&#xD;
      renal function. All patients will be assessed for suitability for nocturnal home hemodialysis&#xD;
      using a standardized method prior to patients entering the baseline portion of this protocol.&#xD;
      The minimum dialysis dose in the standard arm will be an equilibrated Kt/V of 1.1 (equivalent&#xD;
      to a standardized Kt/V (sKt/V) of 2.0) AND a minimum time of 2.5 hours. In the nocturnal arm&#xD;
      there will be a minimum prescription of six hours per session for six days per week AND a&#xD;
      minimum standardized Kt/V of 4.0. Patients will be followed for 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two co-primary outcomes are designated: 1) a composite of mortality with the change over 12&#xD;
      months in the SF-36 RAND physical health composite, and 2) the change over 12 months in left&#xD;
      ventricular mass. In addition, first priority secondary outcomes have been designated for&#xD;
      seven outcome domains: 1) cardiovascular structure and function (change in LV mass), 2)&#xD;
      physical function (change in the PHC), 3) depression/burden of illness (change in Beck&#xD;
      Depression Inventory), 4) nutrition (change in serum albumin), 5) cognitive function (change&#xD;
      in the Trail Making Test B), 6) mineral metabolism (change in average predialysis serum&#xD;
      phosphorus), and 7) clinical events (rate of non-access hospitalization or death).&#xD;
      Hypertension and anemia are also main outcome domains, but without designation of single&#xD;
      first priority outcomes. The cost-effectiveness of the two interventions will also be&#xD;
      compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of the study are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the feasibility of recruiting and retaining patients in a randomized trial&#xD;
           of six times per week at-home nocturnal hemodialysis versus standard three times per&#xD;
           week at home hemodialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine patient adherence and acceptance of nocturnal hemodialysis, and to identify&#xD;
           reasons for discontinuation or noncompliance to the interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Safety:&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine the safety of the nocturnal hemodialysis intervention, with a particular&#xD;
           emphasis on vascular access and patient burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Efficacy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To evaluate the efficacy of six times per week nocturnal HD compared to conventional&#xD;
           three times per week HD on two co-primary outcomes: i) a composite of mortality with the&#xD;
           change over 14 months in left ventricular mass by magnetic resonance imaging, and ii) a&#xD;
           composite of mortality with the change over 14 months in the SF-36 RAND physical health&#xD;
           composite score (PHC).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To determine the effect of six times per week nocturnal HD on nine secondary outcome&#xD;
           domains: i) cardiovascular structure and function, ii) physical function, iii)&#xD;
           depression/burden of illness, iv) nutrition, v) cognitive function, vi) mineral&#xD;
           metabolism, vii) clinical events, viii) hypertension, and ix) anemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Characterization of Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To characterize the six times per week nocturnal home hemodialysis intervention in&#xD;
           comparison to standard home three times per week hemodialysis, including evaluation of&#xD;
           small and middle molecule solute clearance, treatment time, and volume removal.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Implementation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. To determine the feasibility of implementing six times per week nocturnal home&#xD;
           hemodialysis in practice, including evaluation of barriers to implementation such as the&#xD;
           home environment and any potential incremental costs of nocturnal home hemodialysis&#xD;
           compared to three times per week conventional hemodialysis. An evaluation of the cost&#xD;
           effectiveness of six times per week home nocturnal HD relative compared to 3 times per&#xD;
           week conventional home HD will be performed.&#xD;
