      During Phase III, Adolescent Trials Network for HIV/AIDS Interventions&#xD;
      (ATN)/Connect-to-Protect (C2P) site staff, their official community partners established in&#xD;
      Phase I, and newly invited community sector representatives (i.e., individuals from various&#xD;
      key parts of the community such as family, spiritual or faith-based institutions, business&#xD;
      and government) will form a coalition that will work toward achieving C2P objectives. ATN&#xD;
      040b is the evaluation protocol for ATN 040, Phase III of C2P.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phase III's objective is to initiate and complete a community mobilization intervention aimed&#xD;
      at reducing HIV incidence and prevalence among youth. The intervention will consist of&#xD;
      guiding C2P coalitions through a strategic planning process that will result in the&#xD;
      development and implementation of a local action plan. The action plan will focus on changing&#xD;
      structural elements of the affected communities that are believed to be associated with youth&#xD;
      HIV acquisition and transmission. The effectiveness of the intervention will be evaluated by&#xD;
      tracking venues where the population of interest congregates and trends in risk factors&#xD;
      associated with HIV acquisition and transmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ATN 040b evaluates annual anonymous data collection of two cohorts per participating ATN/C2P&#xD;
      site. Both cohorts will represent a site's population of focus, but will be recruited in&#xD;
      different ways and for different activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort #1 will be referred to the site via Official Community Partners and word of mouth.&#xD;
      Each year of the study, 10 to 20 individuals will be recruited to complete venue-tracking&#xD;
      surveys as described in Section 2.1 (N = 40-80 per site over four years). The results will&#xD;
      either confirm that the population of focus can still be reached at previously identified&#xD;
      congregation venues or reveal new ones that should be considered for further research&#xD;
      activities. Each year, based on data from Cohort #1, ATN/C2P site staff will go to two to&#xD;
      three of the confirmed and/or new congregation venues to recruit 20 to 30 participants per&#xD;
      venue for Cohort #2. These participants will complete the HIV-related risk survey, with the&#xD;
      addition of the HIV-Ab assay in the final year only (N = 160-360 per site over four years).&#xD;
      Data will be used to evaluate the intervention within and across ATN/C2P sites.&#xD;

In the fourth and final year only, HIV Antibody [Ab] assays will also be conducted with survey participants to assess HIV serostatus. The survey and HIVAb assay data will be used to evaluate the intervention within and across sites.</description>

    <description>ATN 040b is the evaluation sub-study for ATN 040, Phase III of C2P. Phase III is a community mobilization intervention aimed at reducing HIV rates among youth via community structural change. ATN 040b involves annual anonymous data collection with two cohorts per participating ATN/C2P site. Both cohorts will represent the site's target population, or &quot;population of focus.&quot;</description>

        Each site's population of focus was determined during C2P's Phase I (ATN 016a) and is one&#xD;
        of the following: young women who have sex with men (YWSM), young men who have sex with men&#xD;
        (YMSM), or young users of drugs. For each population, the age range must fall between 12&#xD;
        and 24 years, inclusive.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  An individual who provides verbal confirmation that his or her age falls within the&#xD;
             range of the site's population of focus (which must be within 12 through 24 years,&#xD;
             inclusive);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Verbal confirmation of demographic and sexual orientation/experience profile&#xD;
             reflective of the site's population of focus;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must report engaging in any voluntary sexual activity (vaginal, anal or oral sex)&#xD;
             within the past 12 months, regardless of sexual abuse history; and&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and willingness to provide verbal informed consent/assent in&#xD;
             English or Spanish.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Visibly distraught and/or visibly emotionally unstable (e.g., depressive mood;&#xD;
             exhibiting manic, suicidal, or violent behavior);*&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Visibly intoxicated or under the influence of psychoactive agents#; or&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presents as acutely ill.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Although it is very unlikely that an individual from the community will overtly&#xD;
                  show signs of suicidality, youth with any of these exclusion criteria may be&#xD;
                  approached at a later date if encountered again at the venue and earlier&#xD;
                  exclusionary conditions are resolved.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  For sites targeting drug users, this may pose challenges. Potential&#xD;
                       participants who are visibly under the influence are to be further assessed&#xD;
                       in terms of their level of alertness, coherency, and abilities to understand&#xD;
                       and respond to questions. This is to be done keeping staff and participant&#xD;
                       safety in mind, as well as follow-up procedures such as providing service&#xD;
                       referrals.&#xD;
