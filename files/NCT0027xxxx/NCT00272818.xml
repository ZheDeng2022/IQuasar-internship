  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of gastrointestinal allergy is on the rise and can be manifest in a number of&#xD;
      different clinical presentations. The goal of this study is to evaluate the measurement of&#xD;
      CD23, a protein that can be identified stool, urine, and blood, as a non-invasive marker for&#xD;
      use in the diagnosis and interval assessment of patients with known or suspected&#xD;
      gastrointerstianl allergy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eosinophilic esophagitis (EE) is a disorder typically found in school-age and adolescent&#xD;
      children, and is more prevalent in male patients. Patients with EE typically present with&#xD;
      symptoms of heartburn or difficulties swallowing. Blood and x-ray studies may be normal or&#xD;
      display non-specific findings. The diagnosis of EE rests on a combination of clinical&#xD;
      symptoms, and the results of endoscopic and histologic studies. There is currently no&#xD;
      biochemical marker that can be used to monitor disease course in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cow milk protein intolerance (CMPI) is an allergic process affecting the distal&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract in infants. As such, it often presents as diarrhea without or without&#xD;
      the presence of gross rectal bleeding in infants ranging in age from birth to 6 months of&#xD;
      age. Children display symptoms of abdominal disress including emesis, cramping, colic, or&#xD;
      feeding difficulties. The diagnosis is based on an appropriate clinical history and&#xD;
      supporting physical exam (typically normal). Treatment involves removal of the offending&#xD;
      dietary antigens which include cow or soy milk protein Eosinophilic crypt abscesses, or&#xD;
      collections of eosinophils within the intestine can also be seen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CD23 is a protein that can be found on allergy-type white blood cells (eosinophils), as well&#xD;
      as on the cells that line the gastrointestinal tract. Previous studies have reported&#xD;
      increased levels of CD23 in infants with cow's milk allergy. CD23 is also elevated in infants&#xD;
      and children with allergic disease. Levels of CD23 appears to fall in conjunction with&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;

      Eosinophilic esophagitis (EE) is a disorder typically found in school-age and adolescent&#xD;
      children, and is more prevalent in male patients. Patients with EE typically present with&#xD;
      symptoms of heartburn or difficulties swallowing. Blood and x-ray studies may be normal or&#xD;
      display non-specific findings. The diagnosis of EE rests on a combination of clinical&#xD;
      symptoms, and the results of endoscopic and histologic studies. The endoscopic appearance of&#xD;
      esophageal mucosa in these patients is often pale and displays a poor vascular pattern. The&#xD;
      mucosa can be thickened in appearance. Esophagitis in patients with acid/peptic disease is&#xD;
      typically more pronounced at the bottom of the esophagus, in the region of the&#xD;
      gastroesophageal junction. In contrast, the mucosal disease observed in patients with EE is&#xD;
      often more pronouced in the proximal esophagus. Treatment may include topial steroids&#xD;
      (delivered systemically or via metered-dose inhaler) and formal allergy evaluation to detect&#xD;
      potential dietary triggers. Anti-allergic therapies, including monteleukostat, benedryl,&#xD;
      antihistimines, and cromolyn sodium have also been proposed as treatments for EE. Treatment&#xD;
      efficacy is determined by a combination of clinical report and serial endoscopic study. There&#xD;
      is currently no biochemical marker that can be used to monitor disease course in these&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cow milk protein intolerance (CMPI) is an allergic process affecting the distal&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract in infants. As such, it often presents as diarrhea without or without&#xD;
      the presence of gross rectal bleeding in infants ranging in age from birth to 6 months of&#xD;
      age. Children display symptoms of abdominal disress including cramping, colic, or feeding&#xD;
      difficulties. Emesis after feeds may also be present. Affected children display loose and&#xD;
      more frequent bowel movements. Stools in these patients may contain mucus as well as&#xD;
      microscopic or visible blood. In most patients, the diagnosis is based on an appropriate&#xD;
      clinical history and supporting physical exam (typically normal). Treatment involves removal&#xD;
      of the offending dietary antigens which include cow or soy milk protein. A small percentage&#xD;
      of patients (&lt; 5%) require formal endoscopic study. The mucosa in these patients appears&#xD;
      erythematous, friable, and can display a patchy distribution of inflammation. Histologic exam&#xD;
      reveals varying degrees of eosinophic infiltration of the intestinal tissue. Eosinophilic&#xD;
      crypt abscesses, or collections of eosinophils within the intestine can also be seen.&#xD;
      Patients responding to therapy will display normalization of stool frequency, decreased&#xD;
      symptoms of abdominal discomfort, and an absence of gross or microscopic intestinal bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CD23 is a protein that can be found on allergy-type white blood cells (eosinophils), as well&#xD;
      as on the cells that line the gastrointestinal tract. Previous studies have reported&#xD;
      increased levels of CD23 in infants with cow's milk allergy. CD23 is also elevated in infants&#xD;
      and children with allergic disease, when compared to to children without apparent atopic&#xD;
      disease. Moreover, the level of CD23 appears to fall in conjunction with therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The development of non-invasive markers of intestinal allergy would facilitate diagnosis as&#xD;
      well as provide clinicians with a tool to assess patients compliance and response to therapy.&#xD;
      The relationship between levels of serum, urinary, and fecal CD23 levels has not been&#xD;
      previously studied in patients with known or suspected intestinal allergy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in this study will be asked to provide a blood, urine, and stool sample when they&#xD;
      present with symptoms or either cow milk protein intolerance or eosinophilic esophagitis.&#xD;
      Blood will only be obtained if clinical samples are requested, and no extra blood drawing&#xD;
      will be required for participation in this study. Similar blood, urine, and stool specimens&#xD;
      will be obtained after the patient has been placed on anti-atopic therapy and is experiencing&#xD;
      clinical remission.&#xD;
