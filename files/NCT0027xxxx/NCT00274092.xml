  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to compare the bronchodilator efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      tiotropium inhalation capsules (18 mcg once daily) and Atrovent MDI (2 puffs of 20 mcg&#xD;
      q.i.d.) in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel group study to compare the&#xD;
      bronchodilator efficacy and safety of tiotropium inhalation capsules and Atrovent MDI in&#xD;
      patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following an initial screening visit, patients will enter a 2-week baseline period. Patients&#xD;
      who successfully complete this phase will be randomized into the double-blind portion of the&#xD;
      study in which they will receive tiotropium once daily (morning) or Atrovent four times&#xD;
      daily. Pulmonary function testing will be conducted just prior to the start of therapy at&#xD;
      Visit 2 (i.e. randomization visit after completion of the 2-week run-in period) and at 120&#xD;
      minutes post-dosing. Pulmonary function testing will be repeated at the same time intervals&#xD;
      at the end of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Null and alternative hypotheses The primary objective of this study was addressed by a&#xD;
      two-sided test at the 0.05 level of significance of the null hypothesis that, in patients&#xD;
      with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the bronchodilator efficacy after one&#xD;
      month is no greater on tiotropium inhalation capsules (18mcg once daily) than on ATROVENT MDI&#xD;
      (2 puffs of 20 mcg q.i.d.), against the alternative hypothesis that the bronchodilator&#xD;
      efficacy is greater on tiotropium inhalation capsules (18 mcg once daily).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trough FEV1 response will be analyzed. Peak FEV1, FVC trough and peak response, number of&#xD;
      Rescue Medication and change from baseline in total score of Patient Evaluation Questionnaire&#xD;
      will be analyzed. Change from baseline in each category score of Patient Evaluation&#xD;
      Questionnaire will be also analyzed.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. COPD patients with an Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV1)&lt;= 65% of predicted&#xD;
             normal and FEV1 &lt;= 70% of Forced Vital Capacity (FVC).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Male or female patients 40 years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients must have a smoking history of more than 10 pack-years. A pack-year is&#xD;
             defined as the equivalent of smoking one pack of cigarettes per day for a year.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients must be able to perform pulmonary function tests as required in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients must be able to inhale medication from the HandiHaler device and should have&#xD;
             a good technique of inhaling aerosol administered from an MDI..&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. All patients must sign an Informed Consent Form prior to participation in the trial&#xD;
             i.e., prior to pre-study washout of their usual pulmonary medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with significant diseases other than COPD will be excluded. A significant&#xD;
             disease is defined as a disease which in the opinion of the investigator may either&#xD;
             put the patient at risk because of participation in the study or a disease which may&#xD;
             influence the results of the study or the patient's ability to participate in the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with clinically significant abnormal baseline hematology, blood chemistry or&#xD;
