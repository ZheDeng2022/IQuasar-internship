    <textblock>
      Urinary incontinence (UI) is the complaint of any involuntary leakage of urine. Stress&#xD;
      urinary incontinence (SUI) is the complaint of involuntary leakage on effort or exertion, or&#xD;
      on sneezing or coughing. The prevalence of female UI is greater than that of male, and the&#xD;
      commonest type is SUI. UI has significant impact on the quality of life including physical,&#xD;
      mental and social issues. SUI may also lead to withdraw from regular physical exercise and&#xD;
      fitness activities that important in the prevention of osteoporosis, coronary heart disease,&#xD;
      and so on. The cause of SUI is related to the impairment of pelvic floor muscles (PFM). So&#xD;
      far, the effects of intensive pelvic floor muscle training for female SUI were proved in many&#xD;
      randomized controlled trials. However, training of accurate contraction of PFM depends on&#xD;
      vaginal palpation. The willingness to seek for medical help may be reduced due to being&#xD;
      embarrassed with vaginal palpation. Sapsford proposed a concept to treat SUI via transversus&#xD;
      abdominis (TrA) that does not need to palpate the vagina. Maybe the new intervention can&#xD;
      promote the willingness to seek medical help. However, to date there is no randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial comparing the effect of indirect training of the PFM via TrA with either&#xD;
      untreated control or other intervention. Therefore, there are two purposes in this study, to&#xD;
      compare the effect of indirect training of PFM via TrA with control group and to compare the&#xD;
      effect of indirect training of PFM via TrA with PFMT for female SUI.&#xD;

      In the first period (part I), 100 women with SUI will be recruited in this study and&#xD;
      randomized to intervention or control group after stratified by the moving direction of PFM&#xD;
      during contraction of TrA. All subjects will be evaluated pre- and post- 4-month&#xD;
      intervention. The measurements included basic data and comprehensive urogynaecological&#xD;
      history, women's observations, quantification of symptoms, clinician's measures and quality&#xD;
      of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women in the control group will receive customary information of PFM exercise and they can&#xD;
      decide by themselves to receive an intensive pelvic floor muscle training after control&#xD;
      period or not. The intervention group will follow a specially designed exercise course&#xD;
      including diaphragmatic breathing, tonic activation, muscle strengthening, functional&#xD;
      expiratory patterns and impact activities. They will be individually trained by a physical&#xD;
      therapist for 30-60 minutes eight times during intervention period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second period (part II), another 100 women with SUI will be recruited in this study&#xD;
      and randomized to intervention or control group. All subjects will be evaluated pre- and&#xD;
      post- 4-month intervention. The measurements included basic data and comprehensive&#xD;
      urogynaecological history, women's observations, quantification of symptoms, clinician's&#xD;
      measures and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women in the control group will receive customary information of PFM exercise and they can&#xD;
      decide by themselves to receive intensive pelvic floor muscle training after control period&#xD;
      or not. The intervention group will received intensive pelvic floor muscle training. They&#xD;
      will be individually trained by a physical therapist for 30-60 minutes eight times during&#xD;
      intervention period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive and inferential statistics will be completed using SPSS for windows, version&#xD;
      11.0. Descriptive statistics will be computed for subject demographics. Normality will be&#xD;
      evaluated by using the Shapiro-Wilk test for all variables. The confounding factors between&#xD;
      two groups will be tested by the independent t-test or Chi-square test. A two-way mixed&#xD;
      analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Friedman test will be used to assess possible difference&#xD;
      between pre- and post- intervention and two groups. The Chi-square will be used to assess the&#xD;
      discount dependent variables.&#xD;
