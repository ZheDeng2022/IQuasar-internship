      Objective To test the hypothesis that a nurse-led self-management programme is effective for&#xD;
      men with uncomplicated lower urinary tract symptoms. This will be achieved by comparing&#xD;
      symptom seveirty and the amount of drug therapy used to manage these symptoms in men who&#xD;
      attend a self-management programme, compared to those who do not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design This study will use the format of a randomised controlled trial. 200 new&#xD;
      patients with uncomplicated LUTS will be randomised to either attend or not attend (standard&#xD;
      therapy) a self-management programme. The programme provides education, reassurance, prostate&#xD;
      cancer risk, advice on lifestyle modifications (e.g. fluids - type and amount), concurrent&#xD;
      medication re-scheduling and behavioural changes (double-voiding, strategies for dribbling,&#xD;
      and bladder re-training). These strategies are learnt through group discussion, problem&#xD;
      solving and goal setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All men start the study with a period of watchful waiting (monitoring symptoms only) and are&#xD;
      followed up for a total of 1 year. At each assessment (baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months) symptom&#xD;
      severity and the use of drug therapy to control symptoms will be compared between the two&#xD;
      groups. The only difference between them is that one group has attended a self-management&#xD;
      programme and the other has not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential application of results Self-management focuses on patient involvement in health&#xD;
      care by involving them in the day-to-day control of their symptoms. If effective,&#xD;
      self-management may provide a long-term method of managing LUTS without using drug therapy,&#xD;
      thereby offering considerable health gain and financial savings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NHS Modernisation Agency wishes to develop the role of the nurse specialist to manage&#xD;
      some patients independently of doctors. Nurse-led LUTS assessment clinics are now well&#xD;
      established, perhaps nurses managing these patients with self-management interventions may&#xD;
      become part of standard therapy.&#xD;

      1. OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
           To assess the effectiveness of self-management interventions in men with uncomplicated&#xD;
           LUTS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.1 This is a randomised controlled trial comparing self-management with standard&#xD;
           therapy. These interventions are proposed to optimise watchful waiting, providing an&#xD;
           alternative to drugs and surgery for symptom control.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participants&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.2. Participating urological units include the Middlesex Hospital NHS Trust and the&#xD;
           Whittington Hospital NHS Trust.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.3. 200 new patients with uncomplicated LUTS (I-PSS score 0-35) will be randomised to&#xD;
           either attend a self-management programme or not attend a self-management programme&#xD;
           (standard therapy - control group). There will be approximately 100 men in each group.&#xD;
           Standard therapy, as described previously, involves watchful waiting, drugs or surgery,&#xD;
           the therapeutic choice depending on weighting severity and bother, with risks and&#xD;
           benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.4. All new patients over the age of 40 years with a diagnosis of lower urinary tract&#xD;
           symptoms secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia or age related bladder dysfunction&#xD;
           are eligible for inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.5. The following exclusion criteria applies:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  age under 40 yrs&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  lower urinary tract symptoms due to any urological malignancy or whilst&#xD;
                investigating any urological malignancy e.g. prostate cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  previous prostatic surgery within the last 10 years or pelvic radiotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  complications of urinary obstruction (acute or chronic urinary retention - post&#xD;
                micturition volumes over 300ml, bladder stones, renal failure, recurrent urinary&#xD;
                tract infection or haematuria)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  uncontrolled diabetes, dementia and end stage cardiac or respiratory failure&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  inability to speak or understand the English language&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  severe symptoms where drug therapy or surgical management is indicated or requested&#xD;
                by the patient&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  any man who is or has been in the previous 3 months on medical therapy for lower&#xD;
                urinary tract symptoms, including alpha-blockers, 5-alpha reductase inhibitors&#xD;
                (finasteride) or anti-cholinergics. The use of alpha-blockers for the control of&#xD;
                hypertension is permitted, since these men have symptoms and still are eligible for&#xD;
                medical treatment (finasteride, anti-cholinergics) and surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.6. Each patient will be fully informed regarding the study process and possible uses&#xD;
           of subsequent data collected. An information sheet on headed paper will be available and&#xD;
           a consent form signed by both researcher and patient. The patients who participate in&#xD;
           this study will not participate in any other study conducted by our group in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.7. All GP's will be informed by letter of their patient's participation and progress&#xD;
           in this study. A copy of this standard letter will be left in the patients' notes on&#xD;
           recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.8. Once recruited men will be randomised into 2 groups. Computer generated&#xD;
           randomisation will be carried out by a third party. Randomisation takes place at week&#xD;
           zero of each mans 12 months overall participation in the study. Patients will be&#xD;
           recruited by the study coordinator. On recruitment an enrolment form is completed, and a&#xD;
           copy left in the patient notes along with their consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.9. Group 1 will receive self-management and Group 2 will receive standard therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.10. All men start the study with a period of watchful waiting until their first&#xD;
           assessment at 2 months. During this time men assigned to self-management will attend&#xD;
           their 3 sessions, the control group will not.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.11. Men in Groups 1 &amp; 2 will be followed up as per protocol at 2, 6, and 12 months&#xD;
           after randomisation i.e. short, medium, and long term.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.12. Men randomised into Group 1 (self-management) will in addition to standard follow&#xD;
           up, be invited to attend 3 small group (4-6 men) sessions and receive a single telephone&#xD;
           call (as their self-management programme).&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.13. The four key areas within the self-management programme are:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Education&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Reassurance&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Lifestyle modifications&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Behavioural changes&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.14. The sessions will be facilitated by local nurse practitioners).&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.15. The sessions are standardised and run from a Facilitators Manual developed and&#xD;
           piloted at The Royal College of Surgeons and The Centre for Behavioural and Social&#xD;
           Sciences in Medicine, UCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.16. Each session lasts approximately 2 hours and is a mixture of group learning&#xD;
           through brainstorming and discussion, teaching, and goal setting. All sessions are&#xD;
           supported with a self-management booklet given in session 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.17. Session 1 (first week):&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Introduction and programme review&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Introduction to the concept of self-management&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Education/reassurance - prostate and bladder health, prostate cancer, future&#xD;
                symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Managing fluid intake&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Caffeine abstinence&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Alcohol advice&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.18. Session 2 (second week):&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Adjusting medications which affect LUTS e.g. diuretics (if relevant)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Constipation advice&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Strategies for dribbling&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Double-voiding&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Bladder re-training&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.19. Third week telephone call - trouble shooting problems and answering queries&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.20. Session 3 (six weeks):&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Booster session&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Designed for men to share reasons why some things work and others do not&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Used to discuss reasons why for example they have found it difficult to abstain&#xD;
                from caffeine or other goals set&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.21. Each man in Group 1 will be able to contact the Clinical Nurse Specialist at other&#xD;
           times aside from the sessions in the case of confusion or query, by telephone, e-mail or&#xD;
           letter.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Intervention components&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.22. Education - Men with LUTS should understand:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  LUTS are real symptoms worthy of medical care&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Not all LUTS require treatment with drugs and/or surgery (give details of expected&#xD;
                future symptomology)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  That patients have an important role to play in the management of their symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Each patient has the ability to follow a self-management programme which can have a&#xD;
                beneficial effect on their symptoms - self-efficacy&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The range of treatments available for men with LUTS including why some treatments&#xD;
                are used and not others i.e. the appropriateness of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.23. Reassurance - Men with LUTS should understand:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The symptom severity of many men with LUTS does not change over time (85% stable at&#xD;
                1 year and 65% at 5 years [17,18])&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Some men may see spontaneous symptom improvement&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The annual risk of acute urinary retention is 2% [19]&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  LUTS are often affected by a man's current state of mind, high levels of arousal or&#xD;
                worry can have a detrimental effect&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Their symptoms are not due to detectable prostate cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  That their risk of prostate cancer is that of an age related man with no symptoms&#xD;
                i.e. that of the general male population of the same age [20]&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.24. Lifestyle modifications include fluid, caffeine and alcohol advice.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Fluid advice • Introduce the concept of a healthy fluid balance&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Explain the significance of concentrated urine and the potential detrimental&#xD;
                (irritative) effects&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  There are good fluid habits all men can use regularly with minimal effort&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  There are specific changes that some men may have to make based on their previously&#xD;
                completed charts e.g. excessive intake of water at night&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Excessive or inadequate fluid intake should always be avoided&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A total daily intake of 1500-2000 mls is advised (minor adjustments made for&#xD;
                climate and activity)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Fluid should be spaced evenly throughout the day rather than in large single&#xD;
                amounts&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Fluid restriction for symptom control at times of greatest inconvenience e.g. long&#xD;
                car journeys or when out in public places, is appropriate, but the overall daily&#xD;
                intake should not be restricted significantly (for control of irritative symptoms)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  If nocturia is bothersome, fluid restriction 2 hours before retiring to bed can be&#xD;
                effective&#xD;
&#xD;
           Caffeine Advice&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Explain that caffeine has a detrimental effect on symptoms in men with LUTS especially&#xD;
           irritative symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Explain that caffeine can be found in tea, coffee, chocolate, energy drinks and&#xD;
                over the counter flu remedies&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Explain that by completely avoiding caffeine, symptom improvement may be found&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  If caffeine use is excessive then it should not be stopped overnight but over 2-3&#xD;
                days to avoid headaches and stomach cramps etc&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Caffeine avoidance can be achieved by substituting for drinks that are&#xD;
                de-caffeinated or non-caffeinated e.g. de-caffeinated coffee or a soft drink&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Nocturia can be exacerbated by evening caffeine use, to prevent this caffeine&#xD;
                should be avoided for 5 hours prior to retiring&#xD;
&#xD;
           Alcohol advice&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Explain that alcohol has a detrimental effect on symptoms in men with LUTS especially&#xD;
           irritative symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Explain that by completely avoiding alcohol, symptom improvement may be found, but&#xD;
           that we understand this may not be possible and avoiding alcohol or restriction of&#xD;
           alcohol at times of greatest inconvenience may be more appropriate&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Explain there are quality of life issues with alcohol abstinence and this&#xD;
                information is a guide only&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  In men with nocturia evening alcohol use should be avoided&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Explain when we consume alcohol we often consume large quantities of extra fluid&#xD;
                and symptom reduction may be achieved by substituting large volume alcoholic drinks&#xD;
                for small volume alcoholic drinks e.g. a pint to a short&#xD;
&#xD;
           Timing of concurrent medication • Adjust the time medication (with an effect on urinary&#xD;
           symptoms) is taken to improve LUTS at times of most inconvenience e.g. meetings, long&#xD;
           car journeys and when out in public places&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Substitute an anti-hypertensive diuretic (with the aid of the patient's GP) to a&#xD;
           suitable alternative with less urinary effects in a man with LUTS&#xD;
&#xD;
           Behavioural changes • Men with obvious 'bad habits' will be advised e.g. the going 'just&#xD;
           in case' type of man&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Men with LUTS will be advised to double void&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Men with post micturition dribble should be advised on urethral milking&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Men with LUTS who have 'irritative' symptoms will be offered a formal bladder&#xD;
           re-training programme.&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Advice will be given to men with LUTS regarding avoiding constipation&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.25. Men randomised to the self-management arm of the study will also be offered a&#xD;
           booster or refresher session at six-months, or just after their six month assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.26. The primary outcome is treatment failure. In this study treatment failure is&#xD;
           defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
           • The use of drug therapy for symptom control (as determined by a consultation between&#xD;
           clinician and patient)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Surgical intervention (as determined by a consultation between clinician and&#xD;
                patient)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Symptom deterioration of 3 points[22] or more measured with the I-PSS&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Acute urinary retention&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Death&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.27. Secondary outcomes include a 3 day frequency / volume chart, infection, and&#xD;
           health-seeking behaviour (unscheduled clinic, A&amp;E or GP visits). Secondary outcomes also&#xD;
           include Quality of life / bother assessment using the BPH Impact Index,[24] (appendix&#xD;
           5.), Short Form-36 - SF-36 (appendix 7.) and the Illness Perception Questionnaire - IPQ&#xD;
           (appendix 8.).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The clinicians will be blinded to which group the patients have been assigned to, and&#xD;
           the patients will be asked not to divulge which group they are in. It is not possible to&#xD;
           blind the patients to the group to which group they are assigned to. Any instances of&#xD;
           unblinding will be declared.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Follow up assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.28. Men within the study group will see only the consultant or the specialist&#xD;
           registrar (i.e. continuity throughout the study) doctors will be briefed to the study&#xD;
           design but blinded as to which group each man has been assigned to.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.29. If a man has deteriorated significantly then drug therapy (alpha-blockers,&#xD;
           finasteride or anti-cholinergics) will be offered; standard urological practice. As&#xD;
           these men will only see one of 2 different doctors, moving from conservative to drug&#xD;
           therapy will be consistent.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.30. The outcome of the consultation between clinician and patient will be recorded by&#xD;
           the clinician on a standard form (appendix 9.) and given to the patient, a copy will be&#xD;
           left in the notes.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.31. At this visit the patient will be given the following to complete: I-PSS, BPH&#xD;
           Impact Index, SF-36, Illness perception questionnaire and a 3-day frequency / volume&#xD;
           chart, and will be asked to send to the data manager along with the outcome form&#xD;
           completed by the consultant in a pre-paid envelope.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.32. The data manager is blinded to which group the patient is in and will be&#xD;
           responsible for collecting, loading, and chasing missing data. The data manager will&#xD;
           telephone each patient within 48 hours of their out-patient follow up to complete the&#xD;
           assessment and encourage completion of the study documents.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.33. A follow up rate of more than 80% will be achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1. The two groups will be directly compared with respect to all outcome measurements over&#xD;
      each man's 12 month study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2. Analysis will be on an intention to treat basis, i.e. - men will always be analysed in&#xD;
      the group to which they were assigned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.3. Statistical analysis will be performed with STATA Version 7. An unpaired t-test will be&#xD;
      used to analyse continuous variables e.g. I-PSS, and chi-squared or exact tests will be used&#xD;
      for categorical data. Logarithmic transformation will be used to normalise continuous&#xD;
      variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.4. Sample size - A minimum of 84 men are required in each group to have a 90% chance of&#xD;
      detecting a 3 point difference in mean I-PSS score (SD=6) at the 5% level of significance&#xD;
      using the unpaired t-test. We have chosen a 3-point reduction in I-PSS as it corresponds to a&#xD;
      detectable clinical difference in symptoms by patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. DATA COLLECTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.1. Each man is part of the study programme for 12 months. After this time each man is&#xD;
      discharged from the study programme. If they still require the services of the urology&#xD;
      out-patients for further appointments, investigations or treatment, this will be arranged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.2. If self-management is seen to be effective then it will be offered to men in Group 2 who&#xD;
      received only standard treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.3. The information is anonymised with each patient being given a unique identification&#xD;
      number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.4. Data will be stored securely on The Royal College of Surgeons network in accordance with&#xD;
      the Data Protection Act 1988. Access to this data will be limited to the data manager and the&#xD;
      study coordinator&#xD;
