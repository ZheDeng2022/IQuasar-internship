  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic illness, immunologically mediated, probably induced by&#xD;
      the exposure to an antigen or antigens, to which immunologic tolerance is lost. The disease&#xD;
      has a variable course, from a mild, intermittently symptomatic illness requiring only&#xD;
      symptomatic therapy to a fulminant illness requiring dangerous immunosuppressive therapy,&#xD;
      surgery or both. The molecular defect causing RA has not been characterized, but may involve&#xD;
      aberrant T cell, B cell, and macrophage function. Although RA often responds to&#xD;
      immunosuppressive medication including corticosteroids, methotrexate, azathioprine and&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide, or to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, no therapy has been curative.&#xD;
      In patients with severe RA, who have been unresponsive to corticosteroids, and who have more&#xD;
      than 20 active joints or vasculitis, we propose, as a phase I-II study, complete immune&#xD;
      ablation and subsequent reconstitution with autologous in vitro T lymphocyte depleted PBSCs&#xD;
      harvested from the patient prior to immune ablation. The combination of high dose&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide and anti-thymocyte globulin conditioning will be followed by rescue with&#xD;
      autologous lymphocyte depleted PBSCs. Subsequent disease activity will be followed by: (1) RA&#xD;
      disease activity index, (2) type and amount of therapy for RA, and (3) flow cytometry of&#xD;
      peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets, (4) joint count, (5) patients' assessment of pain, (6)&#xD;
      arthritis impact measurement scales (AIMS) questionnaire, (7) acute phase reactants. This&#xD;
      study will dose standard therapy, i.e. immune suppression, to the point of complete immune&#xD;
      ablation and subsequent recapitulation of lymphocyte ontogeny by PBSC rescue. We anticipate&#xD;
      that this study will also form the basis to clarify further the role of the immune system in&#xD;
      RA.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Physiologic age &lt; 60 years old or &gt;18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. An established clinical diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis by American College of&#xD;
             Rheumatology criteria, and a positive rheumatoid factor will be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients must have failed two disease-modifying agents, such as methotrexate,&#xD;
             plaquenil, gold, azathioprine, asulfidine or D-penicillamine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients must have six (6) swollen joints from active RA and either thirty (30) or&#xD;
             greater involved joints (swelling, tenderness, deformity, pain on motion, or decreased&#xD;
             motion), or have answered less than 75 percent of Health Assessment Questionnaire&#xD;
             (HAQ) questions &quot;without any difficulty.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. A harvest of PBSC greater than 1.4 x 106 CD34+ cells /kg after CD34+ selection will be&#xD;
             necessary for the patient to proceed to transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Ability to give informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients with Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis (JRA) will be candidates if disease onset&#xD;
             is polyarthritic or systemic and they have at least 6 swollen joints and have failed&#xD;
             corticosteroids and two disease-modifying drugs&#xD;
