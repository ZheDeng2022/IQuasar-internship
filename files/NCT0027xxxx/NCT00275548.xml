  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is being done to study the impact of prophylactic administration of antiviral&#xD;
      therapy as compared to initiation of antiviral therapy at the time of clinical recurrence of&#xD;
      hepatitis C infection in liver transplant recipients.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, open-label efficacy and safety study. The&#xD;
      study is being done to see whether treatment using Pegasys (pegylated interferon alfa-2a) and&#xD;
      Copegus (ribavirin) is safer and more effective in liver transplant recipients when given&#xD;
      before hepatitis C infection reappears, or when it is given after clinical symptoms of&#xD;
      hepatitis C reinfection appear. The study is also being done in liver transplant recipients&#xD;
      to estimate how much hepatitis C is detected over time, how the body affects the study drugs,&#xD;
      the safety of the study drugs whether or not the study drugs effect the participants' quality&#xD;
      of life, and whether or not the participants feel more or less depressed as a result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be put into one of two groups. In the preventive group; participants will&#xD;
      receive study drugs for the treatment of recurring (or returning) hepatitis C before&#xD;
      developing actual clinical symptoms. The participants in the observational groups will&#xD;
      receive study drugs for the treatment of recurring hepatitis C only if they develop the&#xD;
      clinical symptoms of hepatitis c infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will have four parts: a screening phrase, a treatment/observational phrase,&#xD;
      follow-up phase and long term safety follow-up phase. Throughout all four stages of the&#xD;
      study, participants will have physical exams, medical and surgical history's will be taken,&#xD;
      blood and urine tests, eye exam, liver biopsy, chest x-ray and electrocardiogram (ECG). If&#xD;
      participants are female, a pregnancy test will also be performed. Participants must also&#xD;
      agree not to drink any alcoholic beverages or take any other drugs for hepatitis c infection&#xD;
      while taking part in the study. Participants must be able to return for clinic visits at&#xD;
      scheduled intervals.&#xD;
