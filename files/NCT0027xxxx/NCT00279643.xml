    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn more about how hair removal with lasers achieves, what&#xD;
      appears to be, permanent hair reduction. Laser hair removal has become one of the most&#xD;
      popular and commonly performed procedures in cosmetic dermatology. However, relatively little&#xD;
      is known about how the permanent reduction in the treated areas occurs. Recently, it has been&#xD;
      discovered that certain cells in the hair follicle must be destroyed in order to achieve&#xD;
      permanent hair reduction. A marker of these types of cells known as keratin 15 has been&#xD;
      identified. By measuring the amount of keratin 15 before and after laser therapy, we hope to&#xD;
      gain a better understanding of how lasers cause hair reduction on a biochemical level.&#xD;

      Laser hair removal has become one of the most popular and commonly performed procedures in&#xD;
      cosmetic dermatology. However, relatively little is known about the mechanisms involved in&#xD;
      achieving what clinically appears to be permanent reduction in hair density in treated areas.&#xD;
      We postulate that in order to achieve permanent hair reduction, stem cells located in the&#xD;
      bulge region of the follicle must be destroyed. Recently, a marker of follicular stem cells&#xD;
      (keratin 15) has been identified and noted to be detectable using immunohistochemical&#xD;
      techniques. In addition, several other immunohistochemical markers for various components of&#xD;
      the hair follicle are available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to quantitatively measure the effects of laser hair removal on the&#xD;
      immunohistochemical staining properties of treated follicles with respect to keratin 15 and&#xD;
      other follicular markers. We hypothesize that the degree of such staining will be greatly&#xD;
      reduced following laser therapy, thus providing, to our knowledge, the first biochemical&#xD;
      evidence to support permanence of the treatment's effects.&#xD;
