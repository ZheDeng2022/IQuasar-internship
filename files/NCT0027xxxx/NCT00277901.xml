  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At Children's Healthcare of Atlanta at Egleston, it is standard of care to do a cardiac MRI&#xD;
      on patients with the diagnosis of Tetralogy of Fallot and Aortic Coarctation to evaluate&#xD;
      heart function. We propose to do a retrospective chart review of patient data along with&#xD;
      their MRI data to analyze ventricular function and cavity volumes pre-Tetralogy of Fallot&#xD;
      repair, post-Tetralogy of Fallot repair (pre-valve repair/replacement) and post-valve&#xD;
      repair/replacement in order to assess the efficacy and optimal timing of valve replacement.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with Tetralogy of Fallot have various degrees and levels of right ventricular&#xD;
      outflow tract obstruction. They undergo surgical removal of the obstructing structures, which&#xD;
      includes the pulmonary valve. The repair of the outflow tract is done utilizing a&#xD;
      transannular patch. This approach, which is considered the standard of care, results in free&#xD;
      pulmonary insufficiency, which may become severe and lead to right heart overloading and&#xD;
      subsequent dilatation and dysfunction. This chronic overloading results in progressive&#xD;
      tricuspid insufficiency and a suspected decline in effective pulmonary blood flow, cardiac&#xD;
      output and right ventricle functional capabilities. Many patients develop progressive&#xD;
      exercise intolerance, arrhythmias and severe cardiomegaly leading to dilated cardiomyopathy.&#xD;
      The progressive decline in patient clinical status results in recommendations of pulmonary&#xD;
      valve replacement to interrupt further dysfunction of the ventricles. Clinical improvement is&#xD;
      generally seen among the patients and cardiac function is measurably improved in many cases,&#xD;
      however the timing of surgery remains undefined and its impact on function improvement and&#xD;
      recovery post -valve replacement is under serious debate and continuous discussion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary work suggests that Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) determined right to left&#xD;
      ventricular volume ratio's of greater than 2:1 with associated tricuspid regurgitation, right&#xD;
      ventricular regurgitant volumes of greater than 50%, and right ventricular ejection fractions&#xD;
      less than 45% are common among patients with severe right ventricular failure and&#xD;
      dysfunction. These patients are in need of pulmonary valve replacement and have routinely&#xD;
      been referred for surgical intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with Aortic Coarctation have a localized malformation characterized by deformity of&#xD;
      the aortic media, causing narrowing, usually severe, of the lumen of the vessel. Surgical&#xD;
      repair or removal of this malformation is the treatment of choice however; the use of MRI to&#xD;
      better determine the extent of damage or malformation would allow the surgeon to plan an&#xD;
      operative strategy prior to opening the chest.&#xD;
