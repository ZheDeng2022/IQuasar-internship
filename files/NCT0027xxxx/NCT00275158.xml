  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pre-eclampsia complicates 7 - 10% of pregnancies and constitutes a leading cause of fetal&#xD;
      growth retardation and premature birth, as well as infant and maternal morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality. The kidney is the primary site of injury resulting in high blood pressure, loss of&#xD;
      protein into the urine and decreased kidney function. The release of vasoconstrictors over&#xD;
      vasodilators from an abnormal placenta may underlie pre-eclampsia. Nitric Oxide (NO) is an&#xD;
      important vasodilator that is thought to play an important role in the kidneys ability to&#xD;
      accommodate to a healthy pregnancy. Normal pregnancy in the rat is accompanied by increased&#xD;
      production of NO and its second messenger cGMP. There is a parallel increase in renal&#xD;
      expression of constitutive nitric oxide synthase (NOS), the enzyme that generates NO from&#xD;
      arginine. In the pregnant rat, an infusion of NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), an&#xD;
      exogenous inhibitor of NOS, has been shown to replicate some of the hemodynamic features of&#xD;
      the syndrome of pre-eclampsia. In a recent animal study, L-arginine supplementation reversed&#xD;
      the adverse effects of L-NAME on pregnancy by attenuating the high blood pressure and by&#xD;
      significantly decreasing protein loss in the urine. To date, studies of the use of L-arginine&#xD;
      supplementation to treat women with pre-eclampsia have been small or uncontrolled and have&#xD;
      only assessed blood pressure as a primary outcome measure. We report a single center,&#xD;
      randomized, placebo-controlled trial of L-arginine supplementation for the treatment of&#xD;
      pre-eclampsia, in which precise physiological techniques have been utilized to assess kidney&#xD;
      dysfunction in addition to blood pressure.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVE: To assess the benefit of L-arginine, the precursor to nitric oxide (NO), to blood&#xD;
      pressure and recovery of the glomerular lesion in pre-eclampsia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS: 45 women with pre-eclampsia were randomized to receive either L-arginine or placebo&#xD;
      until day 10 post-partum. Primary outcome measures including MAP, glomerular filtration rate&#xD;
      and proteinuria were assessed on the third and tenth days postpartum by inulin clearance and&#xD;
      albumin-to-creatinine (A/C) ratio. NO, cyclic guanosine 3'5' monophosphate (cGMP),&#xD;
      endothelin-1 (ET) and asymmetric-dimethyl-arginine (ADMA) and arginine levels were assayed&#xD;
      prior to delivery, on the third and tenth day postpartum. Healthy gravid women provided&#xD;
      control values. Assuming a standard deviation of 10 mmHg, the study was powered to detect a&#xD;
      10 mmHg difference in MAP (alpha 0.05, beta 0.20) between the study groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESULTS: No significant differences existed between the groups with pre-eclampsia prior to&#xD;
      randomization. Compared to the gravid control group, women with pre-eclampsia did not reveal&#xD;
      significantly depressed levels of serum arginine, but did reveal significantly increased&#xD;
      serum levels of ET, cGMP and ADMA prior to delivery. Despite a significant increase in serum&#xD;
      arginine levels due to treatment, no differences were found in the levels of NO, ET, cGMP or&#xD;
      ADMA between the two groups with pre-eclampsia. Further, there were no significant&#xD;
      differences in any of the primary outcome measures with both groups demonstrating equivalent&#xD;
      improvements in both blood pressure and proteinuria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONCLUSION: Blood pressure and kidney function improve markedly in pre-eclampsia by the tenth&#xD;
      day postpartum. L-arginine supplementation does not hasten this recovery.&#xD;
