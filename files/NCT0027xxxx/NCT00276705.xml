      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin and doxorubicin, work in different&#xD;
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from&#xD;
      dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;
      Thalidomide may stop the growth of liver cancer by blocking blood flow to the tumor.&#xD;
      Chemoembolization kills tumor cells by blocking the blood flow to the tumor and keeping&#xD;
      chemotherapy drugs near the tumor. Giving combination chemotherapy, thalidomide, and&#xD;
      chemoembolization before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal&#xD;
      tissue that needs to be removed. Giving thalidomide together with chemotherapy after surgery&#xD;
      may kill any remaining tumor cells and prevent the tumor from coming back.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving combination chemotherapy and&#xD;
      thalidomide together with chemoembolization works in treating younger patients undergoing&#xD;
      surgery for newly diagnosed liver cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the event-free and overall survival of younger patients undergoing surgery for&#xD;
           newly diagnosed, noncirrhotic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with neoadjuvant&#xD;
           cisplatin, doxorubicin hydrochloride, and thalidomide (PLADOTH) followed by&#xD;
           transarterial hepatic arterial chemoembolization comprising cisplatin and doxorubicin&#xD;
           hydrochloride and adjuvant cyclophosphamide and thalidomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the efficacy and tolerability of PLADOTH in patients with initially&#xD;
           unresectable noncirrhotic HCC treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the rate of complete surgical resection by encouragement of liver&#xD;
           transplantation in the treatment strategy as a valid option for tumor removal when&#xD;
           partial liver resection or other surgical options remain unfeasible for patients treated&#xD;
           with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the long-term remission and decreased relapse rates of patients treated with&#xD;
           this regimen based on the postoperative regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the response rate of patients treated with this regimen after treatment with&#xD;
           PLADOTH.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the short-term toxicity and feasibility of PLADOTH in patients treated with&#xD;
           this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the efficacy and toxicity of the postoperative regimen in terms of maintenance&#xD;
           and duration of complete remission (no more evidence of disease and normal&#xD;
           alpha-fetoprotein, if initially elevated) in patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine whether response to PLADOTH by the RECIST criteria can be used for better&#xD;
           monitoring of response of patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine whether the rate of fall of serum VEGF and bFGF levels during PLADOTH can be&#xD;
           used as prognostic factors for short-term and long-term outcome in patients treated with&#xD;
           this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the feasibility of chemoembolization in patients treated with this regimen who&#xD;
           do not respond to PLADOTH.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine which subset of tumors may benefit from an angiostatic treatment approach&#xD;
           based on radiological, surgical, and pathological data collected from patients treated&#xD;
           with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify possible novel factors that might influence treatment choice and disease&#xD;
           outcome based on radiological, surgical, and pathological data collected from patients&#xD;
           treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine guidelines for diagnostic, therapeutic, and follow-up management that would&#xD;
           improve clinical care for patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, nonrandomized, open-label study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients undergo either tumor biopsy or resection. Patients with localized resectable&#xD;
      tumors undergo resection. They then proceed directly to the postoperative treatment. Patients&#xD;
      with initially unresectable tumors undergo biopsy then proceed to the pre-operative regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre-operative chemotherapy and thalidomide (PLADOTH): Patients receive PLADOTH&#xD;
           comprising cisplatin IV continuously over 24 hours on day 1, doxorubicin hydrochloride&#xD;
           IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 2 (or IV continuously over 24 hours on days 1 and 3), and&#xD;
           oral thalidomide daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 courses in&#xD;
           the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients whose tumors are&#xD;
           deemed resectable proceed to surgery. Patients with responding disease but whose tumors&#xD;
           remain unresectable proceed to chemoembolization or receive 2 additional courses of&#xD;
           PLADOTH.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transarterial hepatic artery chemoembolization (TACE): Patients undergo TACE comprising&#xD;
           cisplatin and doxorubicin hydrochloride administered through a catheter placed near the&#xD;
           tumor. TACE may be repeated every 3-4 weeks for as long as disease continues to respond&#xD;
           or until the tumor becomes resectable. Patients also receive oral thalidomide once daily&#xD;
           during TACE. Once the tumor is deemed resectable, patients proceed to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surgery: Patients undergo surgical resection of the tumor. Patients undergo either&#xD;
           partial or total hepatectomy followed by a liver transplant and lung surgery, if&#xD;
           necessary. Patients then proceed to the postoperative treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Postoperative treatment: Beginning within 6 weeks after surgery, patients receive oral&#xD;
           cyclophosphamide once every other day and oral thalidomide once daily for up to 1 year&#xD;
           in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with metastatic disease who show disease progression at any time during treatment go&#xD;
      off study and receive individual advice regarding further treatment based on the decision of&#xD;
      the principal investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 47 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
