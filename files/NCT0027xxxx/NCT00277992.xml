  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with HLHS have a history of poor enteral intake and growth. Over the past several&#xD;
      years a modification to the Norwood operation was instituted (RV to PA shunt in place of the&#xD;
      standard Blalock-Taussig shunt).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether children who underwent this modification of&#xD;
      the Norwood procedure had improved growth compared to those in past years who underwent&#xD;
      traditional Norwood.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether children who underwent this modification of&#xD;
      the Norwood procedure had improved growth compared to those in past years who underwent&#xD;
      traditional Norwood. Also, the standard of care has changed to GT/Nissen operation to&#xD;
      facilitate &quot;safe&quot; feeding in those patients who are not able to feed by mouth (po feed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second aim of this study is to evaluate whether children who are GT fed have improved&#xD;
      growth compared to those who are not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We wish to review all patients who underwent Norwood procedure from January 1, 2001 to March&#xD;
      31, 2005.&#xD;
