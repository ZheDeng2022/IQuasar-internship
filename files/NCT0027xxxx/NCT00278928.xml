      This will be a prospective, randomized trial to determine if differences exist in the&#xD;
      tolerance of lipid injectable emulsions in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Lipid&#xD;
      injectable emulsions are an essential nutrient for neonatal growth and development.&#xD;
      Traditionally, lipid injectable emulsions have been commercially available in sterile glass&#xD;
      bottles, but in April of 2004, a new container was introduced as a sterile plastic bag. In&#xD;
      January, 2005, NICU personnel observed what appeared to be a higher than usual incidence of&#xD;
      hypertriglyceridemia. Upon further laboratory investigation of the lipid injectable emulsions&#xD;
      stored in glass bottles versus those in plastic, significant differences were noted in the&#xD;
      population of large-diameter fat globules by globule size analysis, reflective of a less&#xD;
      stable emulsion in plastic. The United States Pharmacopeia (USP) which sets the standards for&#xD;
      drug purity and safety in the U.S., and whose drug monographs are enforceable by the FDA, has&#xD;
      proposed to limit this large diameter fat globule population to a volume-weighted percent fat&#xD;
      greater than five micrometers or PFAT5 to be less than 0.05% of the total lipid&#xD;
      concentration. (At the present time, the USP monograph is not officially recognized, but is&#xD;
      on track for adoption in 2006.) Our preliminary analyses of four lots of 20% lipid injectable&#xD;
      emulsion packaged in glass to have a PFAT5 of 0.003±0.0008%, compared to an approximate&#xD;
      55-fold increase in the large-diameter fat globule population or 0.166±0.016% for an equal&#xD;
      number of products packaged in plastic. We hypothesize this difference may explain the recent&#xD;
      clinical observations. We will compare the incidence of hypertriglyceridemia in neonates&#xD;
      between lipids packaged in glass versus those in plastic. The study will attempt to discern&#xD;
      whether the differences in packaging influence the stability and subsequent tolerance of&#xD;
      lipid injectable emulsions.&#xD;

      The study is a single-center (BIDMC), prospective, single-blinded, randomized controlled&#xD;
      study involving neonatal ICU patients who will receive lipid injectable emulsion infusions as&#xD;
      part of their normal clinical care. The dosing protocol for all neonates is weight- and&#xD;
      age-based, as shown below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Birth Weight (&lt; 1000 g)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age(Day of Life,DOL)- Lipid Dose g/kg/day:&#xD;
&#xD;
      DOL1- 0; DOL2- 1; DOL3- 1.5; DOL4- 2; DOL5- 2.5; DOL6+-3&#xD;
&#xD;
      Birth Weight (&gt;1000 g)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age-Lipid Dose g/kg/day:&#xD;
&#xD;
      DOL1- 0; DOL2- 1; DOL3- 2; DOL4- 3; DOL5- 3; DOL6+-3&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum triglycerides is the primary outcome indicator of tolerance to the initiation and&#xD;
      advancement of lipid injectable emulsion. Blood samples will be drawn before initiation of&#xD;
      lipids at either DOL-0 or DOL-1, and then at DOL-4 and DOL-7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedures for initiating lipid emulsions in neonates will follow the usual protocol as&#xD;
      per NICU guidelines. On DOL-2, an order for 20% soybean oil lipid emulsion will be written by&#xD;
      a physician or designated licensed assistant as per protocol. The Pharmacy Department will&#xD;
      receive the order, and compound and dispense it in an appropriately sized syringe. Patients&#xD;
      will receive lipids taken from either glass bottles or plastic bags according to a&#xD;
      pre-assigned randomization scheme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All lipid injectable emulsion lots in glass and plastic will be recorded as used in the&#xD;
      study. In addition, all lots will be analyzed with respect to the globule size distributions&#xD;
      in the Nutrition/Infection Laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Justification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 82 randomized patients are required for analysis of the differences between&#xD;
      lipid injectable emulsion formulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size was generated from the data obtained from the retrospective analysis&#xD;
      described above in B2. A two-sided test based on a normal distribution, a nominal&#xD;
      significance level of 0.05, and a statistical power of 0.80 were assumed. Based on these&#xD;
      assumptions, the power calculation reveals an equal sample size for both groups is calculated&#xD;
      to be 41. Hence, the total sample size of 82 patients is required to detect statistically&#xD;
      significant differences in the incidence of hypertriglyceridemia between infusion groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will be comparing lipid tolerance in critically ill neonates receiving pharmacy-prepared&#xD;
      syringes of 20% soybean oil-based lipid injectable emulsion taken from commercially&#xD;
      available, FDA-approved products that use either a glass or plastic packaging container. The&#xD;
      primary outcome variable in assessing lipid tolerance will be serum triglycerides. A two-way&#xD;
      analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be employed to assess the differences between lipid&#xD;
      injectable emulsion products. The two independent variables are 1) Lipid Container (or&#xD;
      Treatment) and, 2) Time (over 7 days); while the dependent variable will be serum&#xD;
      triglycerides. If significant differences are detected by ANOVA, then individual differences&#xD;
      will be further evaluated using Bonferroni tests for pair wise comparisons. All data will be&#xD;
      expressed as the mean ± SD with statistical significance set at a p-value of &lt;0.05. Analysis&#xD;
      will be done at BIDMC under the supervision of the study PI. Although not expected to play a&#xD;
      significant role, drop-out and missing data will be adjusted accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients who present to the neonatal intensive care unit at BIDMC who require intravenous&#xD;
      nutritional support and provide informed consent will be included in the study. The decision&#xD;
      to initiate intravenous nutritional support will be made by clinical personnel, and the&#xD;
      dosing protocol for lipid injectable emulsion will follow institutional procedures as shown&#xD;
      above in B3 (Description of Study Protocol) (section1-a). Patients will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive one of two study parenteral lipid emulsions. As hydrocortisone therapy is rarely used&#xD;
      in the treatment of refractory hypotension in neonates, and has been shown to induce&#xD;
      hypertriglyceridemia in very low birth weight infants (younger than 29 weeks' gestational age&#xD;
      at birth), such patients will be excluded from study. Due to randomization, patients enrolled&#xD;
      in either group are expected to be similarly distributed with respect to gestational age,&#xD;
      gender and race.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential study subjects will be identified by neonatal intensive care unit physicians at&#xD;
      BIDMC who have determined intravenous nutrition support is clinically indicated. Parent(s) or&#xD;
      guardian(s) of the NICU patient will review and sign a written informed consent form. The&#xD;
      form will be obtained by NICU physicians or one of the co-investigators listed above.&#xD;
      Prospective parents or guardians of the patient will be presented, in lay terms, the two&#xD;
      options for providing intravenous lipid emulsions. The purpose of the study and current data&#xD;
      regarding the standard of care will be presented to parents or guardians of the patient, and&#xD;
      that assignment to either group (glass vs. plastic) will be random or determined by chance.&#xD;
      Parents or guardians will be informed that participation is completely voluntary and that all&#xD;
      patient data will be kept confidential. All aspects of this study will take place in the&#xD;
      neonatal intensive care unit.&#xD;
