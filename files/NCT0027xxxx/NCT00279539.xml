  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and bioactivity of intramyocardial gene&#xD;
      transfer using VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) in patients with ischemic heart&#xD;
      failure. The research treatment of this CHF study will involve the use of an intramuscular&#xD;
      injection with a catheter inserted in through the groin to transfer a type of DNA (phVEGF165&#xD;
      gene) to the wall of the heart. Genes (which are part of the DNA molecules) carry&#xD;
      instructions to allow the cells to produce specific proteins. Gene transfer or treatment with&#xD;
      DNA (a necessary part of all cells) is being studied for the treatment of patients with heart&#xD;
      failure. This research therapy, which is experimental and not proven, is designed to try to&#xD;
      grow new blood vessels to improve blood flow to areas of the heart that are not receiving&#xD;
      enough blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DNA is present in all cells and provides the instructions for making proteins. After&#xD;
      delivering a piece of DNA containing the vascular endothelial growth factor 1 (VEGF-1) gene&#xD;
      (the product being studied) into cells, the cells may produce a specific protein called&#xD;
      vascular endothelial growth factor 1 (VEGF-1). Animal studies have indicated that the VEGF-1&#xD;
      protein may cause new blood vessels to grow. The Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Gene (ph&#xD;
      VEGF 165) is found on the VEGF DNA. Experiments performed in animals show that once in the&#xD;
      heart wall, the DNA directs the cells of the heart muscle to make the VEGF protein. VEGF 165&#xD;
      is a protein that has been shown to stimulate cells (known as endothelial cells), which form&#xD;
      the inner lining of blood vessels. This protein causes cells to divide and grow, thereby&#xD;
      forming new blood vessels. It is anticipated that this new blood supply may help the heart&#xD;
      pump the blood more effectively and relieve some heart failure symptoms. We do not yet have&#xD;
      enough information to know what will happen in humans, that is why we are doing this&#xD;
      research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After gene transfer we will begin a process to help move some of the stem cells from the bone&#xD;
      marrow into the blood circulation. Subjects will be given the drug called G-CSF (a drug used&#xD;
      to move cells from the bone marrow into the blood stream). Stem cells are young cells&#xD;
      produced by bone marrow (the spongy cavity in the center of large bones) that can develop&#xD;
      into blood cells or other types of cells. This medication triggers the movement of stem cells&#xD;
      out of the bone marrow and into the blood stream. Before being released into the blood&#xD;
      stream, stem cells receive signals that direct them to become specific types of cells such as&#xD;
      CD34+ cells (endothelial progenitor cells). CD34+ cells that move to or are in the area of&#xD;
      damaged heart tissue may promote growth of new blood vessels that supply blood and nutrients&#xD;
      and thereby improve the chance of survival of heart tissue, improve heart function, and&#xD;
      possibly have a long-term benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will be recruiting 12 subjects for this study. There will be no randomization and no&#xD;
      placebo group. Once eligibility in the research study has been determined all subjects will&#xD;
      be treated with the VEGF and G-CSF.&#xD;
