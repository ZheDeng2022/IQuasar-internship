      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pelvic floor muscles (PFM) are located inside the pelvis, surrounding the urethra, vagina&#xD;
      and rectum. They provide structural support for the pelvic organs. Dysfunctional PFM can lead&#xD;
      to urine and fecal incontinence, pelvic organ prolapse (POP), sexual problems and chronic&#xD;
      pain syndromes. POP increases with age, parity and weakness in the PFM. Symptoms associated&#xD;
      with POP are backache, bladder, bowel and sexual dysfunction, and pelvic heaviness. Thus the&#xD;
      condition is debilitating and can greatly affect the quality of life, interfering with&#xD;
      day-to-day activities and reduce participation in physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the project:&#xD;
&#xD;
      As life expectancy increases, more women may experience POP. Hence it is important to prevent&#xD;
      and treat the condition at an early stage. Despite being a common disorder among women,&#xD;
      little research has been done on POP. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT). PFMT is a non-invasive method with no adverse effects.&#xD;
      If there is significant effect, the main goal is to incorporate this method in clinical&#xD;
      practice among physiotherapists and medical doctors. If PFM training is effective, more&#xD;
      emphasis of PFM training can be put into regular female fitness programs. The prevalence of&#xD;
      POP increases with age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single blind randomised controlled trial to evaluate the effect of PFMT on POP. 100&#xD;
      women with POP will be randomised to either training or control group. The training programme&#xD;
      will last for six months, training once a week with a physiotherapist in addition to a&#xD;
      structured home training programme. A blinded case-control study will also be carried out. 50&#xD;
      women without POP will be matched for age and vaginal deliveries. Before starting the RCT&#xD;
      study, a reproducibility study on perineal ultrasound will be carried out in 18 women.&#xD;

      Background for the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidences and prevalence of POP is difficult to determine, since many women do not seek&#xD;
      medical advice and treatment for the condition. It has been estimated that half of women who&#xD;
      have given birth lose some of the pelvic floor support, resulting in some degree of prolapse.&#xD;
      Of these 10-20% will seek medical help. About 10% of all women will at one point in life&#xD;
      undergo surgery for a prolapse condition. The incidence of POP requiring surgery after a&#xD;
      hysterectomy is 3.6% per 1,000 women per year in the UK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of POP can be conservative (PFMT), mechanical (use of a pessary) or surgical. A&#xD;
      recently published Cochrane review concluded that there are no studies evaluating the effect&#xD;
      of PFMT on POP. PFMT is without adverse effects, and theoretical knowledge of anatomy and&#xD;
      function of the PFM provides a basis for trying strength training of the PFM both to prevent&#xD;
      and to reverse POP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Norway Bø (1990, 1999) PhD, physiotherapist and professor at the Norwegian School of Sport&#xD;
      Sciences (NSSS), has developed a training model for strengthening the PFM. The results from&#xD;
      several randomised controlled trials of this program have shown high cure and improvement&#xD;
      rates both in prevention and treatment of urinary incontinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound and MR examinations have shown that after vaginal delivery the pelvic floor is&#xD;
      situated in a lower position than in nullipara. In addition, the pelvic floor of stress urine&#xD;
      incontinent (SUI) women is in a lower position than of continent women. DeLancey et al (2003)&#xD;
      showed that women with POP generated 43% less maximum force and had more atrophy of the&#xD;
      pelvic floor muscles than women without prolapse. One of the main theories explaining the&#xD;
      effectiveness of PFMT on SUI includes factors that may change through strength training:&#xD;
      increased cross-sectional area of the muscle (muscle volume), neurogen adaptation, imposed&#xD;
      viscoelastic properties (&quot;stiffness&quot;) of the connective tissue and altered location of the&#xD;
      PFM at a higher level in the pelvic cavity. Morphological changes in relation to PFMT have&#xD;
      not been examined in RCTs, but have shown a cure rate of 44-70% measured as &lt; 2 gram leakage&#xD;
      in various pad tests and significant increase in muscle strength after PFMT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have shown that &gt; 30% of women are unable to contract the PFM properly at the&#xD;
      first consultation. Bump et al (1991) showed that 25% were pushing downwards instead of&#xD;
      lifting up and in. Other common mistakes are to use muscle groups outside the pelvic area&#xD;
      instead of the PFM. Instruction, feedback, close follow-up and high adherence are important&#xD;
      factors if the strength training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is to evaluate whether PFMT can reverse and prevent further&#xD;
      development of POP. The project comprises a RCT (main study). In addition we will conduct a&#xD;
      case-control study to investigate risk factors, such as muscle strength and joint flexibility&#xD;
      in women with and without POP. The project description below will focus on the RCT. The same&#xD;
      measurements will be used in the case-control study, and women participating in the RCT will&#xD;
      be cases of the case-control study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method, design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main study is a prospective randomised trial. Women with POP will be referred by selected&#xD;
      community gynaecologists working in Oslo and Akershus. Those who express an interest in&#xD;
      participating in the project will be referred to physiotherapist and manual therapist&#xD;
      Ingeborg Hoff Brækken, who is the project manager. The women will participate in a structured&#xD;
      interview; complete a questionnaire about symptoms and quality of life and undergo a clinical&#xD;
      examination at. Gynaecologist Majida at Akershus university hospital will conduct the&#xD;
      ultrasound examination. The women will be stratified by the stage of prolapse after the&#xD;
      pelvic floor prolapse quantifying (POPQ). They will then be randomised into two groups; PFMT&#xD;
      or control. Brækken will train the intervention group at Hans &amp; Olaf Fysioterapi A/S. The&#xD;
      gynaecologist will be blinded for group allocation. After 6 months all women from both groups&#xD;
      will be referred to the physiotherapist where they will complete the same questionnaire about&#xD;
      symptoms and quality of life and measure PFM strength. The gynaecologist will then conduct&#xD;
      the same ultrasound examination and POPQ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drop-out routines:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot;intention to treat&quot; principle will be followed. Moreover, a per-protocol analysis will&#xD;
      be carried out in those who have completed ≥ 80% of the recommended training regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol for PFMT:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pre-contraction (the &quot;knack&quot;). All women will be taught how to contract the PFM before,&#xD;
           during and after increases in abdominal pressure (coughing, sneezing, heavy lifting)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Home training. The intervention group will be asked to perform 3 sets of 8-12 near&#xD;
           maximum contractions per day in different positions with the legs abducted. All women&#xD;
           will receive a booklet and a DVD showing the exercise program. Adherence will be noted&#xD;
           in a diary&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Training and follow-up with a physiotherapist. The women visit the physiotherapist for&#xD;
           training with vaginal pressure biofeedback once a week for 3 months. For the next 3&#xD;
           months they train once every second week with the physiotherapist (total of 18 times).&#xD;
           Muscle strength is registered at each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group receives no treatment. After the project period they will be referred to a&#xD;
      physiotherapist if they so wish.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Case-control study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In parallel with the training intervention, 50 female controls without POP will be referred&#xD;
      from the same gynaecologists. In this case-control study only women with stage 0 on POPQ will&#xD;
      be included in the control group. They will be examined in the same way as the main study&#xD;
      group by the physiotherapist and gynaecologist. PFM strength and clinical tests for &quot;benign&#xD;
      hypermobility joint syndrome&quot; will be conducted. They also complete the same forms as in the&#xD;
      RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We use SPSS version 11 for data analysis with relevant statistical methods to compare the&#xD;
      groups. Results of continuous variables will be given as an average of 95% CI. Results will&#xD;
      be given as numbers needed to treat (NNT). The level of significance will be set at &lt; 5%.&#xD;
      Professor of statistics, Ingar Holme PhD, NSSS, is advising the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics&#xD;
&#xD;
      Names and personal identity numbers will not be registered. All data will be stored in a&#xD;
      locked and fireproof cabinet. Data is filed in the same way as all the project data at&#xD;
      Norwegian Social Sciences Data Services (NSD) in Bergen. The project complies with the&#xD;
      Helsinki declaration in requiring all participants to give their written informed consent.&#xD;
      The project has been approved by the Southern Regional Health Authority's committee on&#xD;
      medical ethics.&#xD;
