    <textblock>
      We propose to conduct a randomized study of standard behavioral weight-loss treatment to test&#xD;
      if using an electronic diary with or without tailored feedback will improve adherence to&#xD;
      self-monitoring and subsequently improve weight loss. Subjects will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      different methods to self-monitor food and exercise habits: (1) use of the traditional paper&#xD;
      diary , (2) use of a personal digital assistant (PDA), or (3) use of a personal digital&#xD;
      assistant that also provides daily feedback.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of obesity, a major chronic health problem that is an independent risk factor&#xD;
      for coronary heart disease (CHD), continues to increase at an alarming rate. Although weight&#xD;
      control research has significantly improved short-term treatment success, long-term weight&#xD;
      loss maintenance has lagged behind. Research has demonstrated a consistent relationship&#xD;
      between self-monitoring eating and physical activity habits and success in weight loss as&#xD;
      well as in maintenance of weight loss. However, the methods primarily used for&#xD;
      self-monitoring continue to be the paper diary (PD), which is time consuming and burdensome.&#xD;
      Moreover, PDs do not permit immediate external feedback to support and motivate the&#xD;
      individual. Emerging technologies could improve self-monitoring and weight loss treatment.&#xD;
      However, the use of these technological advances, such as a personal digital assistant (PDA),&#xD;
      has not been studied in weight loss treatment. The primary aim of this behavioral weight loss&#xD;
      treatment study is to determine if self-monitoring of daily eating and physical activity&#xD;
      habits using a PDA, with or without a tailored feedback intervention, is superior to using a&#xD;
      PD in terms of promoting and maintaining short- and long-term weight loss. Secondary aims&#xD;
      include comparing the effect of treatment group assignment on adherence to self-monitoring&#xD;
      and on risk factors for CHD (lipids, glucose, insulin, C-reactive protein). We propose to&#xD;
      enroll 198 subjects and randomize them to one of three treatment groups that will use&#xD;
      different methods to self-monitor eating and physical activity habits: (1) use of the&#xD;
      traditional PD with delayed written feedback, (2) use of a PDA with limited feedback on daily&#xD;
      targets, or (3) use of a PDA with limited feedback on daily targets plus receive daily,&#xD;
      subject-tailored feedback messages via the PDA. The proposed study includes prolonged (24&#xD;
      months) supervision of self-management with three important components: self-monitoring,&#xD;
      feedback, and ongoing contact. Subjects will complete assessments at baseline, 6, 12, 18, and&#xD;
      24 months. This innovative study will provide information on the efficacy of combining&#xD;
      technological advances with proven behavioral strategies.&#xD;
