  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a therapy combining the established FUNIL regimen&#xD;
      with Thalidomide. We want to see how well the therapy works, if it can be easily done, and&#xD;
      how well the body handles the treatment. We also wish to see if the addition of Thalidomide&#xD;
      will increase the effectiveness of the already established treatment regimen.&#xD;

      Eligible patients who agree to take part in the study will receive oral dosages of&#xD;
      Thalidomide at 200mg/day to start, with dosage gradually increasing up to a maximum of&#xD;
      1200mg/day. This will be taken in combination with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      5-fluorouracil, given by continuous IV infusion over 24 hours (Day 1) every week for 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interferon-α, given subcutaneously on Day 1, 3 and 5 of every week for 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interleukin-2, given by continuous IV infusion Days 2-5, every week for 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will be followed by 2 weeks of rest then repeated.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients must have histologically proven renal cell carcinoma which is metastatic,&#xD;
             non-resectable and/or recurrent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have bidimensionally measurable disease as defined in Section 10.1a&#xD;
             documented within 28 days prior to registration. X-rays, scans, or physical exam of&#xD;
             all non-measurable disease must be completed within 42 days prior to registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prestudy chest x-ray must be done within 42 days prior to registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior treatment with drugs included in this protocol is permitted if such prior&#xD;
             treatment occurred more than 6 months previous or if patient is currently exhibiting&#xD;
             minor, mixed or partial response to any of these drugs. Prior treatment with other&#xD;
             drugs is allowed as long as therapy was discontinued at least one month previously.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior radiation therapy (to less than 25% of the bone marrow only, see section 19.2),&#xD;
             or surgery are allowed. At least 4 weeks must have elapsed since the completion of&#xD;
             radiation therapy, and there must be measurable disease outside the radiation fields.&#xD;
             At least 3 weeks must have elapsed since completion of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have had an EKG performed within 28 days prior to registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a Southwest Oncology Group performance status of 0-2 as defined in&#xD;
             Section 10.4.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not be receiving or planning to receive concomitant biologic therapy,&#xD;
             radiation therapy, hormonal therapy, or other chemotherapy while on this protocol&#xD;
             (including G/GM-CSF).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with currently untreated brain metastases or brain metastases on current&#xD;
             therapy are not eligible. Patients with prior brain metastases S/P radiation and/or&#xD;
             surgery, and with stable response, confirmed by MRI, off corticosteroids may be&#xD;
             eligible. Brain MRI within 28 days of treatment and consultation with the Study&#xD;
             Coordinator is required for such patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or nursing women may not participate. Women/men of reproductive potential may&#xD;
             not participate unless they have agreed to use an effective contraceptive method.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with other serious illnesses, serious active infections requiring treatment&#xD;
             with antibiotics, those requiring ongoing therapy with other investigational drugs or&#xD;
             those receiving or expected to require corticosteroids are not permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known AIDS or HIV-1 associated complex or known to be HIV antibody&#xD;
             seropositive are not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In calculating days of tests and measurements, the day a test or measurement is done&#xD;
             is considered Day 0. Therefore, if a test is done on a Monday, the Monday four weeks&#xD;
             later would be considered Day 28. This allows for efficient patient scheduling without&#xD;
             exceeding the guidelines. If Day 28 or 42 falls on a weekend or holiday, the limit may&#xD;
             be extended to the next working day.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and give written&#xD;
             in-formed consent in accordance with institutional and federal guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be registered with the UNM Cancer Center Protocol Office. All records&#xD;
             and flow sheets must be sent to this office.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active substance abuse can lead to unexpected and dangerous drug interactions and&#xD;
             toxicities and impair compliance; therefore, this condition is an exclusion to&#xD;
             registration or continuation on this study. Patients with a history of substance abuse&#xD;
             must have blood or urine testing prior to registration on protocol. Psychosocial&#xD;
             screening by the clinic psychologist or social worker is also suggested but not&#xD;
             required. Patients found to be actively engaged in substance abuse while on protocol&#xD;
             may be discontinued from protocol treatment at the direction of their physician and/or&#xD;
             the study coordinator.&#xD;
