      The primary endpoint of this phase II trial is the objective tumor response rate. The&#xD;
      secondary endpoints include treatment-related toxicity, the clinical benefit response defined&#xD;
      by the change in performance status and body weight, the change in quality of life,&#xD;
      progression free survival and overall survival. Simon's optimal two-stage design will be used&#xD;
      to determine the patient number.&#xD;

      The regimen consists of docetaxel, 50 mg/m2, 5-FU, 2400 mg/m2, and leucovorin, 240 mg/m2 on&#xD;
      days 1 and 15. Docetaxel will be given by 1-hour intravenous infusion and 5-FU/leucovorin by&#xD;
      24-hour intravenous infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment cycle will be repeated every 4 weeks. Dexamethasone will be given before and&#xD;
      after each docetaxel infusion to prevent hypersensitivity and fluid retention. Tumor response&#xD;
      will be evaluated every 2 cycles. For patients with inoperable locally advanced disease on&#xD;
      entry, those who achieve clinical complete (CR) and partial (PR) response will be evaluated&#xD;
      for the feasibility of curative surgical resection.If pathological CR is documented, at least&#xD;
      2 cycles of chemotherapy will be given after surgery. If microscopic residual tumor is noted&#xD;
      after curative surgery, protocol treatment will be continued until disease progresses or&#xD;
      intolerable toxicities develop. For patients with metastatic diseases on entry, those who&#xD;
      achieve CR will receive at least 2 more cycles of chemotherapy after documentation of CR.&#xD;
      Patients with PR will continue protocol treatment until disease progresses or intolerable&#xD;
      toxicities develop. Patients with stable disease will continue protocol treatment if there&#xD;
      are minor tumor responses or improvement of their general condition; patients will stop&#xD;
      protocol treatment and change to salvage therapy if no any clinical benefits are observed.&#xD;
      Patients with progressive disease should stop protocol treatment and change to salvage&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of this phase II trial is the objective tumor response rate. The&#xD;
      secondary endpoints include treatment-related toxicity, the clinical benefit response defined&#xD;
      by the change in performance status and body weight, the change in quality of life,&#xD;
      progression free survival and overall survival. Simon's optimal two-stage design will be used&#xD;
      to determine the patient number.If 5 or more objective responses are documented in the first&#xD;
      19 patients, the study will go on to the second stage to enroll a total of 54 eligible&#xD;
      patients. The P0, P1,are 20%, 40%, 0.05, and 0.1, respectively. Assuming a dropout rate of&#xD;
      10%, 21 patients will be accrued in the first stage and 39 in the second stage. Estimated&#xD;
      time for patient accrual is 3 years.&#xD;
