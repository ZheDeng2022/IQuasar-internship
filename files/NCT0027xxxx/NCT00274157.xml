      The specific aims of the project are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine whether catheter-based revascularization procedures improve functional capacity&#xD;
      and quality of life among patients with intermittent claudication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate whether improvements in walking ability result in a less sedentary lifestyle&#xD;
      and improvement of the cardiovascular risk profile.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with intermittent claudication have decreased functional abilities and impaired&#xD;
      quality of life [QOL]. In addition, peripheral arterial disease is associated with an&#xD;
      increased risk of a life threatening cardiovascular event. Due to advances in endovascular&#xD;
      technologies, peripheral revascularization procedures are now offered to a growing number of&#xD;
      patients with lifestyle limiting claudication, rather than solely for the treatment of&#xD;
      critical limb ischemia. Indeed, according to data derived from the National Health Discharge&#xD;
      Survey, there was a 979% increase in the number of catheter-based revascularization&#xD;
      procedures performed during the period 1995-2000. Despite well defined patency outcomes, the&#xD;
      functional and QOL benefits of catheter-based revascularization procedures are largely&#xD;
      undefined. In addition to improving leg symptoms and QOL, increasing walking ability among&#xD;
      patients with claudication may lead to a less sedentary lifestyle and improvement of the&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk factor profile. However, this relationship has not yet been demonstrated.&#xD;
      The proposed project is a longitudinal cohort study that will follow patients with&#xD;
      intermittent claudication for one year after a catheter-based revascularization procedure to&#xD;
      measure changes in functional capacity, QOL, and cardiovascular risk factors. Patients will&#xD;
      be evaluated at baseline and at 3 and 12 months following the procedure. A total of 60&#xD;
      patients will be studied over a three-year period. Functional parameters to be assessed will&#xD;
      include treadmill walking distances, the 6-minute walk test, walking velocity, and&#xD;
      self-assessed walking ability as determined by the Walking Impairment Questionnaire. Activity&#xD;
      level during daily life will be assessed using a vertical accelerometer device, which will be&#xD;
      worn by patients for a 7-day period at each time point. Quality of life will be assessed by&#xD;
      the Short Form-36 Questionnaire and the Geriatric Depression Scale. Cardiovascular risk&#xD;
      factors to be measured will include anthropomorphic parameters, blood pressure, lipids,&#xD;
      markers of inflammation, homocysteine, and insulin-sensitivity. It is intended that data&#xD;
      generated from this study will provide initial data to plan a multi-centered randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial of best medical therapy and exercise training versus catheter-based&#xD;
      revascularization for the treatment of lifestyle limiting claudication.&#xD;
