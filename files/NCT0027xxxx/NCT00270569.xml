    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death for women in Taiwan. We have&#xD;
      recently demonstrated that combination of paclitaxel and cisplatin, at conventional doses, is&#xD;
      highly effective in the treatment of breast cancer. However, the acute and cumulative&#xD;
      toxicities of paclitaxel have been troublesome to a significant portion of the patients.&#xD;
      Several lines of evidence suggested that weekly paclitaxel, at a much lower dose range of 40&#xD;
      to 50 mg/m2 per week, may be as effective as that of the conventional doses of paclitaxel (80&#xD;
      to 90 mg/m2 per week) for patients with metastatic ovarian and lung cancers. The low-dose&#xD;
      regimen of paclitaxel may significantly improve the compliance of the patients. This&#xD;
      open-label phase II trial is designed to test this hypothesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The eligibility criteria include (1) women with metastatic breast cancer; (2) measurable&#xD;
      disease; (3) acceptable organ function reserves. The ineligibility criteria include (1) brain&#xD;
      or leptomeningeal metastases; (2) previous chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer. The&#xD;
      study consists of two stages. All eligible patients will receive stage I (low-dose) regimen:&#xD;
      paclitaxel, 50 mg/m2 1-hour iv infusion on days 1, 8 and 15, and cisplatin, 40 mg/m2 24-hour&#xD;
      iv infusion on days 1 and 8. The treatment cycle will be repeated every 4 weeks. The first&#xD;
      tumor response assessment will be done after 2 cycles of protocol treatment. Patients with&#xD;
      complete response (CR) will receive at least 2 more cycles of low-dose regimen after&#xD;
      documentation of CR. Patients with partial response (PR) and patients with stable disease&#xD;
      (SD) who have minor tumor response or improvement of general condition will continue to&#xD;
      receive the low-dose regimen. Patients with SD but no evident clinical benefit and patients&#xD;
      with progressive disease (PD) will be shifted to stage II (conventional-dose) regimen:&#xD;
      paclitaxel, 80 mg/m2 1-hour intravenous infusion on days 1, 8 and 15, and cisplatin, 40 mg/m2&#xD;
      24-hour intravenous infusion on days 1 and 8, every 4 weeks. Tumor assessment will then be&#xD;
      evaluated after every 2 cycles of protocol treatment. For patients who continue low-dose&#xD;
      regimen, those with CR will receive at least 2 more cycles of protocol treatment. Patients&#xD;
      with a maximal response of PR or SD may either continue the low-dose regimen until PD or&#xD;
      prohibitive toxicity develops or change to the conventional-dose regimen, at the discretion&#xD;
      of the attending physicians. Patients with PD should change to the conventional-dose regimen.&#xD;
      For patients who have shifted to conventional-dose regimen, those with CR will receive at&#xD;
      least 2 more cycles of protocol treatment. Patients with PR will continue protocol treatment&#xD;
      until disease progresses or prohibitive toxicity develops. Patients with SD may continue&#xD;
      protocol treatment or change to salvage therapy. Patients with PD should stop protocol&#xD;
      treatment and change to salvage therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of this phase II trial is the objective response rate of the stage I&#xD;
      (low-dose) regimen. The secondary endpoints include treatment-related toxicity, the change in&#xD;
      quality of life, progression free survival and overall survival. Simon's optimal two-stage&#xD;
      design will be used to determine the patient number. If 4 or more objective responses (CR+PR)&#xD;
      are documented in the first 13 patients, the study will go on to the second stage to enroll a&#xD;
      total of 43 patients. The P0, P1,are 20%, 40%, 0.05, and 0.2, respectively. Assuming a&#xD;
      dropout rate of 10%, 15 patients will be accrued in the first stage and 33 in the second&#xD;
      stage. Estimated time for patient accrual is 3 years.&#xD;
