      This trial will test the hypothesis that among 20 children and adolescents from Children's&#xD;
      Hospital, Boston with Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, systemic-onset juvenile rheumatoid&#xD;
      arthritis, juvenile dermatomyositis, systemic lupus erythematosus, mixed connective tissue&#xD;
      disease and vasculitis, treatment of glucocorticoid-associated osteopenia and osteoporosis&#xD;
      with 18 months of alendronate (FOSAMAX®, Merck &amp; Co., Inc.) will result in greater&#xD;
      improvement in the mean change of individual AP spine bone mineral density (BMD) (gm/cm2)&#xD;
      determined by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) than treatment with 18 months of&#xD;
      standard of care therapy.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be diagnosed with either ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease,&#xD;
             systemic-onset juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile dermatomyositis, systemic lupus&#xD;
             erythematosus (SLE), mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) or vasculitis according to&#xD;
             standard criteria where available, and according to treating physicians when not&#xD;
             available.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have diminished AP lumbar spine (L1-L4) BMD by DXA (Hologic 4500) with a&#xD;
             Z score ≤ -1.5 SD assessed within 8 weeks of the Baseline Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have received daily, alternate day or weekly systemic glucocorticoid&#xD;
             therapy for a minimum of six months total in their life-time.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be between the ages of 8 and 21 years, 11 months, at randomization.&#xD;
             Although subjects younger than 8 years of age may be affected by osteoporosis, limited&#xD;
             normative data prevents assignment of a BMD Z score for this group.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Regarding subjects with child-bearing potential Females who have had at least one&#xD;
             menstrual cycle must either be abstinent or must be using an effective method of birth&#xD;
             control.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current or recent (within 6 months) treatment with therapeutic doses of a&#xD;
             bisphosphonate, calcitonin, human growth hormone, and heparin, all agents known to&#xD;
             alter bone density&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A history of recent (within one year of screening) major upper gastrointestinal (GI)&#xD;
             disease (above the jejunum), including, but not limited to, peptic ulcer, esophageal&#xD;
             disease or active GI bleeding, or ever had surgery of the upper GI tract other than&#xD;
             pyloroplasty. A history of abnormalities of the esophagus which delay esophageal&#xD;
             emptying, such as stricture or achalasia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hyperthyroidism (suppressed thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and elevated free&#xD;
             thyroxine (T4)), hyperparathyroidism (elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH)), malignancy,&#xD;
             rickets, or osteomalacia (by history), all assessed within 8 weeks of the Baseline&#xD;
             Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  25 (OH) vitamin D below 20 mg/L&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Planned or current pregnancy and/or breastfeeding&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Renal dysfunction defined as dependence on dialysis or a creatinine clearance &lt; 35&#xD;
             ml/min, assessed within 4 weeks of the Baseline Visit. Creatinine clearance = [(height&#xD;

             [(height in cm x 0.70)/plasma creatinine] for males ³ 13 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hepatic insufficiency defined as SGPT or SGOT greater than twice normal for age,&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Uncorrected hypocalcemia (ionized calcium&gt;10% below age-adjusted range), assessed&#xD;
             within 4 weeks of the Baseline Visit&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known or suspected hypersensitivity to bisphosphonates&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to follow instructions for dosing, including being unable to swallow the&#xD;
             study medication with plain water first thing in the morning, stand or sit upright&#xD;
             without any other food or beverage for at least 30 minutes following dosing and until&#xD;
             their next meal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Weight greater than 136 kg (300 lb), as the DXA is not reliable for subjects of this&#xD;
             size&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Weight less than 17 kg (37 lb), assessed within 8 weeks of the Baseline Visit&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Permanent foreign body (prosthetic, surgical clips, permanent earring/umbilical ring)&#xD;
             in region of results of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Enrollment Procedures interest, or soft tissue calcinosis overlying the region of&#xD;
             interest&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to undergo dual energy X-ray absorptiometry or CT scan&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Developmental or cognitive delay which may interfere with cooperation and/or&#xD;
             compliance with the procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject expects to move out of the area during the study period, rendering follow-up&#xD;
             per protocol impractical&#xD;
