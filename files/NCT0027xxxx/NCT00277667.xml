  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of&#xD;
      quetiapine compared to placebo (sugar pill without medication) in the treatment of bipolar&#xD;
      disorder with moderate to severe hypomania or mild mania. Quetiapine is approved by the&#xD;
      United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of schizophrenia and&#xD;
      bipolar mania.&#xD;

      Methods and Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single center, eight-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel&#xD;
      group, flexible-dose study in 40 outpatients with bipolar disorder types I, II, or NOS by&#xD;
      DSM-IV-TR criteria who also have moderate-to-severe hypomanic symptoms or mild manic symptoms&#xD;
      (defined as a score of &gt; 3 but &lt;5 on the Clinical Global Impressions Scale Modified for&#xD;
      Bipolar Disorder [CGI-BP]). Subjects may have concurrent depressive or anxiety symptoms or&#xD;
      syndromes, but they may not have psychotic features (as defined in DSM-IV) or substance&#xD;
      dependence. The primary outcome measure will be change in the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS)&#xD;
      scores. Secondary outcome measures will include the total of the YMRS and the Inventory for&#xD;
      Depressive Symptoms (IDS), the IDS alone, the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A), the&#xD;
      CGI-BP, the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF), the Life Functioning Questionnaire (LFQ),&#xD;
      and the Sheehan Disability Scale (DSD). Of note, the YMRS-IDS total reflects a novel means of&#xD;
      assessing total affective burden. Also, IDS will be used to assess depressive symptoms&#xD;
      because of our experience in the Stanley Foundation Bipolar Network indicating that this&#xD;
      scale better assesses the signs and symptoms of bipolar depression as compared to both the&#xD;
      Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Scale&#xD;
      (MADRAS). The LFQ is a validated gender neutral scale specifically designed to assess&#xD;
      functional outcome in bipolar disorder. The Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS),&#xD;
      Simpson Angus Scale (SAS), and Barnes Akathisia Scale (BARS), will be used to assess for&#xD;
      degree and severity of extrapyramidal side effects experienced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis and Data Monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects with observations available from the baseline and at least one post-baseline&#xD;
      visit will be included in analyses. The primary outcome measure will be the change in YMRS&#xD;
      scale scores from baseline to last observation. The difference in YMRS change between&#xD;
      treatment groups will be tested for significance (alpha=0.05, two-tailed) using an&#xD;
      independent-samples t-test. Measures of change in total affective burden, depressive and&#xD;
      anxiety symptoms, global improvement, use of adjunctive anxiolytic and hypnotic medication,&#xD;
      adherence to study medication, frequency and severity of side effects, and reasons for early&#xD;
      termination will also be analyzed. The final dose achieved by each subject will be correlated&#xD;
      with scale score change. Tolerability will be assessed based on adverse experiences, clinical&#xD;
      laboratory tests, vital signs (blood pressure and pulse), weight, and discontinuation rates.&#xD;

          1. Subjects must be 18 years of age or older.&#xD;

             by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text&#xD;
             Revision (DSM-IV-TR) criteria. Of note, bipolar NOS disorder will include subjects&#xD;
             with either recurrent or sporadic brief hypomanias (hypomanias of 1 to 3 days in&#xD;
             duration).&#xD;

             must be clinically significant (at least mild) but no worse than moderately severe,&#xD;
             defined as a CGI-BP scale for mania &gt; 3 and &lt; 5, on at least 2 assessment days at&#xD;
             least 3 days apart during the screening phase.&#xD;
