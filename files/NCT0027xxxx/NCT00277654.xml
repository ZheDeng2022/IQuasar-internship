  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy (how&#xD;
      well the drug works) of risperidone compared to placebo (an inactive drug) in the treatment&#xD;
      of bipolar disorder with panic disorder or generalized anxiety disorder. Risperidone is&#xD;
      currently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment&#xD;
      of schizophrenia and bipolar mania. Risperidone is not currently FDA approved for the&#xD;
      treatment of bipolar hypomania with or without panic disorder or generalized anxiety disorder&#xD;
      (the condition being investigated in this study).&#xD;

      Methods and Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel-group, 3 site, 8-week trial&#xD;
      of risperidone monotherapy in outpatient subjects with a lifetime bipolar I, II, or not&#xD;
      otherwise specified (NOS) disorder, a lifetime panic or generalized anxiety disorder, and&#xD;
      current, at least moderately, severe anxiety symptoms. Approximately 90 subjects will be&#xD;
      enrolled to obtain 60 subjects who complete the 8-week trial. Subjects will be randomized to&#xD;
      risperidone or placebo in a 1:1 ratio. No concomitant psychotropic medication will be allowed&#xD;
      except for as needed (prn) lorazepam during the first two weeks for the management of&#xD;
      affective and anxiety symptoms, and prn zolpidem and zaleplon throughout the study for the&#xD;
      management of insomnia. Throughout the study, psychiatric scales will be used to assess&#xD;
      psychiatric symptoms and the presence of treatment-emergent adverse events will be monitored&#xD;
      and recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medication Dosing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risperidone will be administered at an initial dose of 0.5 to 1 mg/day and will be titrated&#xD;
      upward to a dose considered optimal by the investigator based on the subject's clinical&#xD;
      response and adverse events, but not to exceed 2.0 mg/day by the end of the second week.&#xD;
      Subsequently, risperidone may be increased based on clinical response and tolerability to a&#xD;
      maximum of 4.0 mg/day. As needed study-prescribed (prn) use of lorazepam will be allowed for&#xD;
      the management of affective and anxiety symptoms for the first two weeks of the study; a&#xD;
      maximum of 2 mg per day will be allowed during the first week, and a maximum of 1 mg per day&#xD;
      will be allowed during the second week. During the second week, the subject must be tapered&#xD;
      off the lorazepam. For the final six weeks of the study, no lorazepam will be permitted.&#xD;
      Zolpidem (10-20 mg/day) or zaleplon (10-20 mg/day) will be allowed for management of&#xD;
      insomnia, and benztropine (0.5 - 3.0 mg/day) will be allowed for management of extrapyramidal&#xD;
      symptoms. The latter three agents will be permitted throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From week 2 on, any medications with psychotropic effects are prohibited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Visit(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Screening Period will last a minimum of 2 to a maximum of 30 days. At the first screening&#xD;
      visit (Visit 0), informed consent will be obtained. The Mini International Neuropsychiatric&#xD;
      Interview (MINI), with the Manic Module from the MINI plus, will be performed to establish&#xD;
      whether the patient meets DSM-IV criteria for bipolar disorder I, II, or NOS, and for panic&#xD;
      disorder or generalized anxiety disorder. For generalized anxiety disorder, the portion of&#xD;
      Criterion F - that stipulates &quot;the disturbance does not occur exclusively during a mood&#xD;
      disorder&quot; will be suspended. The CGI-BP and the CGI-S will be performed to establish the&#xD;
      severity of bipolar affective symptoms and anxiety symptoms, respectively. Subjects will keep&#xD;
      a mood chart in between visits to help them follow their affective and anxiety symptoms. The&#xD;
      subject's bipolar symptoms must be evaluated as no more than moderately severe (defined as a&#xD;
      CGI-BP &lt; 4), and his/her anxiety symptoms must be evaluated as at least moderately severe (a&#xD;
      CGI-S of &gt; 4) for him/her to be able to continue in the screening process and enter the&#xD;
      randomized phase. Medical history will be reviewed, a physical exam performed,&#xD;
      electrocardiogram (EKG) and laboratory studies (complete metabolic profile, CBC with&#xD;
      differential and platelets, urinalysis, pregnancy test, and urine drug screen) will be&#xD;
      obtained. Based on these evaluations, it will be determined whether subjects meet entry&#xD;
      criteria; subjects meeting these criteria will continue in the screening process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Visit (last Screening Visit):&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline (Visit 1), subjects whose screening evaluations continue to meet all&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria may enter the study and be randomized. These evaluations will&#xD;
      include repeating the Clinical Global Impression modified for bipolar illness (CGI-BP) and&#xD;
      the Clinical Global Improvement Scale for anxiety symptoms (CGI-S) to ensure the subject&#xD;
      continues to have no more than moderately severe bipolar affective symptoms and at least&#xD;
      moderately severe anxiety symptoms. Baseline ratings will include: the Sheehan Panic Anxiety&#xD;
      Scale-Clinician Rated (SPAS-C); the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) to assess anxiety&#xD;
      symptoms; the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) to assess manic symptoms; and the Inventory for&#xD;
      Depressive Symptoms (IDS) (long form) to assess depressive symptoms. Subjects will also be&#xD;
      evaluated with the CGI-BP, and the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS). The Panic-Agoraphobic&#xD;
      Spectrum-Self-Report (PAS-SR) will be used to assess the lifetime presence of core and&#xD;
      related features of panic disorder. (Subjects who score &gt; 35 on the PAS-SR will be classified&#xD;
      a-priori as having panic spectrum symptoms [PSS]). The Family Impact Scale (FIS) will be&#xD;
      administered. The Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS), Simpson Angus Scale (SAS), and&#xD;
      Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS) will be administered to assess for extrapyramidal&#xD;
      symptoms. Blood pressure, pulse, height, and weight, will be measured. Study medication will&#xD;
      be dispensed by the Physician Investigator in the form of 0.5 mg capsules. The dose range of&#xD;
      risperidone will be 0.5 to 4 mg/day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Period:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study visits will occur every week through the eight weeks of treatment. It is expected that&#xD;
      risperidone will be gradually increased to an optimal dose during the first month of&#xD;
      treatment. The following procedures will be completed at each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Collect unused risperidone, perform study drug accountability, and record dosage of&#xD;
           study drug used. A subject's unused study medication can be re-dispensed back to the&#xD;
           subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Review mood chart and administer Clinician Global Improvement on anxiety symptoms -21&#xD;
           point scale (CGI-I-21), Patient Global Improvement on anxiety symptoms -21 point scale&#xD;
           (PGI-21), SPAS-C, HAM-A, YMRS, IDS, CGI-BP, and SDS ratings.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assess and record adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Perform AIMS, SAS, and BARS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Obtain blood pressure, pulse, and weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Record concomitant medication use (from mood chart)&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Adjust risperidone dose (if necessary) and dispense study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Final Evaluation (week 8) or Early Termination:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following evaluations will be conducted at the completion of, or early withdrawal from,&#xD;
      the 8-week treatment phase. All psychiatric evaluations and all other final study procedures&#xD;
      (including a repeat physical exam, EKG, and laboratory studies) will be completed prior to&#xD;
      the discontinuation of risperidone. The evaluations to be performed are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collect unused risperidone, perform study drug accountability, and record dosage of&#xD;
           study drug used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review mood chart and perform CGI-21, SPAS-C, HAM-A, YMRS, IDS, CGI-BP, PGI-21, and SDS&#xD;
           ratings.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Repeat PAS-SR&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Repeat FIS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess and record adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obtain blood pressure, pulse, weight, and determine BMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Perform physical examination, AIMS, SAS, BARS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obtain laboratories (complete metabolic profile, CBC with/differential and platelets,&#xD;
           urinalysis, pregnancy test, and urine drug screen).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Repeat EKG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Record concomitant medication use (from mood chart)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adjust risperidone dose (if necessary) and prescribe drug (if subject has responded and&#xD;
           chooses to continue on risperidone), or dispense risperidone taper for discontinuation&#xD;
           (if subject has not responded or if subject chooses to discontinue risperidone for any&#xD;
           reason).&#xD;
