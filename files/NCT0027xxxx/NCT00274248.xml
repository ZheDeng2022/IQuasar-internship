  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1, open-label, multicenter study investigating the use of MLN518 in&#xD;
      combination with standard chemotherapy to patients with newly diagnosed AML. Two dose levels&#xD;
      of MLN518-200 mg and 400 mg given orally twice a day are planned for sequential evaluation in&#xD;
      separate groups of patients. Patients assigned to the 400 mg dose level given orally twice a&#xD;
      day of MLN518, will potentially have their dose of MLN518 adjusted on the basis of MLN518&#xD;
      plasma concentrations measured during the first 3 days of induction therapy. All patients&#xD;
      will receive initial induction chemotherapy with cytarabine, 200 mg/m2/day by CIVI on Days 1&#xD;
      through 7, and with daunorubicin, 60 mg/m2/day by intravenous (IV) push (IV infusion if&#xD;
      borderline cardiac function is detected) on Days 1 through 3 (&quot;7+3&quot;). An abbreviated&#xD;
      cytarabine and daunorubicin regimen (&quot;5+2&quot;) will also be used when the initial remission&#xD;
      induction therapy fails to clear the bone marrow of blast cells (as typically detected on the&#xD;
      Day 15 bone marrow) and a second attempt at remission induction is indicated. Patients who&#xD;
      achieve a complete remission (CR) will receive consolidation therapy with HiDAC (standard or&#xD;
      modified) in combination with continued MLN518 treatment. Patients remaining in continuous CR&#xD;
      after completion of their last cycle of consolidation therapy will be permitted to continue&#xD;
      treatment with single-agent MLN518 for 6 months thereafter.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female patients, at least 18 years of age, with newly diagnosed (previously&#xD;
             untreated) AML, regardless of the mutational status of FLT3 in their leukemic blasts.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unequivocal histologic diagnosis of AML (based on the World Health Organization [WHO]&#xD;
             and/or FAB classifications), excluding acute promyelocytic leukemia. AML patients with&#xD;
             a history of antecedent myelodysplasia (MDS) are eligible for treatment in this trial&#xD;
             but must not have had prior cytotoxic therapy for MDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No prior anti-neoplastic therapy for leukemia or MDS with the following exceptions:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  emergency leukapheresis;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  emergency treatment for hyperleukocytosis with hydroxyurea;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  growth factor/cytokine support.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 3&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pretreatment laboratory test values within the following limits no more than 7 days&#xD;
             before enrollment:&#xD;

               -  total bilirubin equal or less then 1.5 x the upper limit of normal;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase equal or less then 2.5 x&#xD;
                  the ULN;&#xD;

             study.&#xD;

             reliable methods of birth control (ie, a hormonal contraceptive, an intrauterine&#xD;
