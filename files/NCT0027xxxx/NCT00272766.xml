  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effect on visual acuity of Macugen&#xD;
      (pegaptanib sodium) in patients with subfoveal choroidal neovascularization (CNV) secondary&#xD;
      to the ocular histoplasmosis syndrome (OHS).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ocular histoplasmosis is a leading cause of severe and irreversible central vision loss in&#xD;
      middle-aged adults living in the central and eastern US. OHS has been associated with the&#xD;
      fungus Histoplasma capsulatum, a dimorphic soil mold found in 18 to 20 states in the central&#xD;
      and eastern US. Annually, approximately 100,000 people are thought to be at risk of vision&#xD;
      loss caused by OHS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will include OHS patients with CNV lesions no larger than 5400 microns in greatest&#xD;
      linear diameter with classic or occult CNV extending under the geometric center of the FAZ&#xD;
      and best-corrected visual acuity letter score between 20/40-20/200. Twenty four patients will&#xD;
      be enrolled and the study will have 2 treatment arms with 12 patients each. The first arm&#xD;
      will consist of 12 patients who will receive 0.3 mg of Macugen intravitreally every 6 weeks&#xD;
      for one year. The second arm will consist of 12 patients who will receive Photodynamic&#xD;
      Therapy (PDT) with Visudyne every 3 months for one year.&#xD;
