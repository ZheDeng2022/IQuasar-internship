      The increase in life expectancy in the 21st century has resulted in a major growth in the&#xD;
      prevalence of age-related diseases and conditions. Depression has been found to be the most&#xD;
      prevalent among the various mental disorders in later life. It was emphasized that depression&#xD;
      in the elderly is a persistent or recurrent disorder resulting from psychosocial stress or&#xD;
      physiologic effects of disease and can lead to disability, cognitive impairments, intensified&#xD;
      symptoms of other medical conditions and increased utilization of health care services. Due&#xD;
      to the rapidly aging population, depression is a serious public health concern that has a&#xD;
      great impact on quality of life and may lay a considerable burden on the health care systems.&#xD;
      However depression among the elderly may prove to be hard to diagnose since in aged persons&#xD;
      depressive symptoms are often masked by somatic complaints or by cognitive impairments.&#xD;
      Consequently depression is often under diagnosed and the patients continue to visit&#xD;
      constantly the nurse or the physician without getting an adequate answer to their problem.&#xD;
      For that reason over utilization of health care services may be an indicator to the presence&#xD;
      of undiagnosed depression. The purpose of this study is to examine the relationships between&#xD;
      socio-demographic variables, high primary care utilization and depressive symptomatology&#xD;
      among aged patients.&#xD;

      Introduction The number of Israel's elderly (65 plus) has increased from just 85,200 (4.8% of&#xD;
      the population) in 1955 to approximately 670,000 people (about 10%) in 2003 (Brodsky et al.,&#xD;
      2005). According to the most conservative of three projections offered by the Israeli Central&#xD;
      Bureau of Statistics (CBS), the number of seniors is expected to be approximately 676,500&#xD;
      (9.8% of the population) in 2005, to rise to 722,500 people (10.7% of the population) by 2010&#xD;
      and increase to 1,025,800 (almost 12% of the population) by the year 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The increase in life expectancy in the 20th century has resulted in a major growth in the&#xD;
      prevalence of age-related diseases and conditions. Depression has been found to be the most&#xD;
      prevalent among various mental disorders in later life and is the third most common reason&#xD;
      for consultation in primary care (Shah, 1992). Research shows that 10-15% of the persons over&#xD;
      65 years of age suffer from various levels of depressive symptoms (Jacob&amp; Palmer, 1998).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sadock &amp; Sadock (2003) state that depression among elderly may reach up to 15 percent and&#xD;
      among these suffering from dementia from 25- 50 percent. Israeli studies show similar rates&#xD;
      of depressive symptomatology as performed in other Western countries. A prevalence of 21.5&#xD;
      percent of depressive symptomatology was found among a random sample of 937 Israeli adults.&#xD;
      (Iancu et al., 2003).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depression represents a heterogeneous set of disorders, usually characterized by sad mood and&#xD;
      inability to experience pleasure. Among the elderly it often may present itself atypically,&#xD;
      with somatic symptoms dominating the clinical picture (Jacob &amp; Palmer, 1998). Common physical&#xD;
      complaints, start with the most common features as loss of energy or fatigue, unexplained&#xD;
      pain, gastrointestinal symptoms, headache, dizziness, palpitations, heartburn, numbness, loss&#xD;
      of appetite, insomnia specifically early morning awakening. In general, the more unexplained&#xD;
      somatic complaints and physical symptoms a patient have, the higher the likelihood of&#xD;
      depression (Glass 2003). Elderly depression impairs significantly the quality of life by&#xD;
      leading to disability, cognitive impairments, intensified symptoms from medical conditions&#xD;
      and increases utilization of health care services and the direct and indirect medical costs&#xD;
      (Luber et al., 2001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Herrman et al.,( 2002) argue that health care utilization among depressed patients is higher&#xD;
      then among those without depression. Elderly with depressive symptoms found to be at least as&#xD;
      twice as likely to use emergency department and medical inpatient hospital services compared&#xD;
      to patients without depressive symptomatology ( Himelhoch et al., 2002). Simon &amp; Ormel(1995)&#xD;
      as well as Katon et al. (2003) stated that patients with depressive symptoms account for&#xD;
      43-52% higher health care costs than patients without depressive symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The increase in costs associated with depressive symptoms was noted even after adjusting for&#xD;
      the severity of chronic medical illness (Glass, 2003). According to the WHO the significance&#xD;
      of illness burden attributable to depression increases with age and thus will grow further by&#xD;
      the year 2020 based upon projected demographic shifts towards an older population (Peveler et&#xD;
      al., 2002).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trend was showed in Israel by Brodsky et al.( 2005). They reported an elderly average of&#xD;
      11.5 visits at the FP per year while, in the USA, only 25% of the elderly population visited&#xD;
      any physician 10 or more times annually - including visits to the ER and home visits (Health,&#xD;
      United States,2003).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consequently detecting and treating elderly patients with depressive symptoms in Israel, may&#xD;
      be cost-effective and produce improvement in health and well-being for the money spent in the&#xD;
      care of these older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However depression in the aged patient may be atypical in nature and more difficult to&#xD;
      diagnose from that in the general population. Therefore it is often under-diagnosed and&#xD;
      under-treated (Jacob &amp; Palmer, 1998). In contrast to younger depressed patients, elderly&#xD;
      patients often avoid reporting or showing that their mood level and tend to hide their state&#xD;
      of disease or, worse, they lack the consciousness of the disease and think that enjoying life&#xD;
      less than before is an inevitable consequence of aging. Moreover, elderly sometimes attribute&#xD;
      their depressive symptoms to general medical conditions. Other factors that may hinder&#xD;
      distinguishing depression from other conditions are also concomitant diseases, especially&#xD;
      dementia, polypharmacy and drug reactions (Glass, 2003). Furthermore Hybels et al. (2001)&#xD;
      compared in their study the demographic and risk factor profiles of elderly individuals with&#xD;
      less and more severe depression. The obtained results indicated the need to recognize that&#xD;
      elderly adults who do not meet the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&#xD;
      (DSM) criteria for depression, and those who fall below the threshold on instruments such as&#xD;
      the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression scale (CES-D), may still experience&#xD;
      depressive symptomatology that warrant attention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current scales used today measure physical deterioration as part of the depressive state,&#xD;
      while among the older people these are part of the aging process and may confuse the&#xD;
      therapist. The Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) is a more specific tool for the measurement&#xD;
      in this age group. It was developed during the 80's (Brink et al., 1982) proven valid and&#xD;
      reliable at 1986 and was translated to many languages including Hebrew. (Zalsman et al.,&#xD;
      1998). Today it is one of the most widely used instruments for the screening of depression&#xD;
      among the elderly population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To simplify the screening process a Yale Task Force on Geriatric Assessment has recommended&#xD;
      the use of a single question, &quot;Do you often feel sad or depressed?&quot; (Lachs et al., 1990).&#xD;
      Mahoney et al.( 1994 ) found this question as a valid and reliable short-form alternative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conclusion depression is a prevalent mental disorder in later life and a considerable&#xD;
      impending public health problem since it may lay unnecessary cost burden on one hand and is&#xD;
      difficult to diagnose on the other. Consequently, there is a need to find the most effective&#xD;
      ways for early detection of this condition. This study will examine the question whether high&#xD;
      health care services utilization and/ or sociodemographic background may predict the presence&#xD;
      of depression among aged patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purposes of this study is to examine the relationships between socio-demographic&#xD;
      variables, comorbidity, depressive symptomatology and high primary care utilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHOD:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in 10 primary health care clinics in urban communities of&#xD;
      Beersheva, Israel. According to the average health care utilization, 11.5 visits to the FP&#xD;
      per year (Brodsky et al., 2005)) among elderly in Israel, we classify two groups: &quot;low care&#xD;
      utilizers&quot; with ≤ 6 visits per year and &quot;high care utilizers&quot; with ≥ 16 visits. Primary lists&#xD;
      of &quot;high and low care utilizer&quot; will be obtained by query to &quot;Clicks&quot; electronic medical&#xD;
      chart system ( Roshtov Soft wear industry ltd.) .&#xD;
