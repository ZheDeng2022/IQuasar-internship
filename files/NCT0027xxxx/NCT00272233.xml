  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Work requirements for medical trainees result in substantial sleep loss. Sleep loss has been&#xD;
      associated with increased levels of certain inflammatory hormones that could have negative&#xD;
      impact on blood vessel function. The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of&#xD;
      sleep loss on blood hormone levels and blood vessel function in medical trainees.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Context: Sleep loss is associated with increased blood levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and&#xD;
      C-reactive protein (CRP). Medical residents are often deprived of normal sleep during&#xD;
      extended work shifts, but the effects of work-related sleep loss on biomarkers of vascular&#xD;
      inflammation and function are unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: We sought to test the hypothesis that sleep loss during extended work shifts&#xD;
      during medical training is associated with increased circulating levels of pro-inflammatory&#xD;
      biomarkers and evidence of vascular dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Outcome measures were assessed after extended 30-hour work shifts and non-extended&#xD;
      6-hour work shifts in a single-blind, randomized crossover design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting: University hospital medical intensive care unit&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients or Other Participants: Twenty-two healthy medical residents were studied during a&#xD;
      medical intensive care unit rotation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Outcome Measure(s): Sleep related cytokines (interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor),&#xD;
      serum markers of vascular inflammation (C-reactive protein), and flow-mediated dilation in&#xD;
      the brachial artery.&#xD;
