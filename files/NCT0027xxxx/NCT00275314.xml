  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open label, randomized, 3-way cross-over study. 21 subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive all three treatments in one of three treatment sequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients at risk of CMV disease (D+R-, D+R+, D-R+), who are being treated prophylactically&#xD;
      with Valcyte® (commercially available tablets), after their first or second kidney transplant&#xD;
      and who have adequate renal and hematological function will be eligible for the study.&#xD;
      Screening may be at any time after transplantation provided that follow-up procedures can be&#xD;
      completed during the scheduled time of prophylaxis. The first dose of study drug may be&#xD;
      between 1 and 14 days after screening provided the transplant has stabilized, stable serum&#xD;
      creatinine and steady-state kinetics of ganciclovir and calcineurin inhibitor therapy have&#xD;
      been attained. Follow-up will take place 7- 14 days after last dose of study drug&#xD;
      administration; therefore the duration of the study will be up to 5 weeks.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Each patient will receive 900 mg of Valcyte® daily with food for the period specified in that&#xD;
      center (typically 100 days), starting as soon as possible after the transplant. According to&#xD;
      routine practice, intravenous ganciclovir (5 mg/kg) may be substituted if the patient is&#xD;
      unable to tolerate oral medication, during which time the patient will not be enrolled into&#xD;
      the study. The dose of Valganciclovir may be reduced or interrupted at the discretion of the&#xD;
      Investigator if he, or she, suspects that ganciclovir-related toxicity has occurred, or if&#xD;
      the estimated creatinine clearance of the patient drops below 60 ml/min For the actual study,&#xD;
      each patient will receive 2 days treatment on consecutive days with each Valganciclovir syrup&#xD;
      formulation (900 mg once a day.) and the tablet formulation (900 mg once a day) in a&#xD;
      randomized order, before continuing with Valcyte® prophylaxis (commercially available&#xD;
      tablets). The following three treatments will be administered in this study: Randomization&#xD;
      will occur through the IDS pharmacy and a computerized system will randomize the subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment A (Reference): Valganciclovir tablets 2 x 450 mg once a day for 2 days&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment B (Test): Valganciclovir tutti-frutti flavored syrup, 900 mg once a day for 2 days&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment C: (First formulation) Valganciclovir strawberry flavored syrup, 900 mg once a day&#xD;
      for 2 days&#xD;
&#xD;
      All formulations will be administered orally within 15 minutes of completion of a standard&#xD;
      breakfast (400-800 kcal). Patients will be seen at that GCRC (General Clinic Research Center)&#xD;
      on the 8th floor of Montefiore Hospital for all study visits except follow-up. This visit&#xD;
      will take place in the Infectious Disease Clinic, 7th floor Falk Clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A screening examination will be performed between 1 and 14 days before the start of the study&#xD;
      (the day of first dosing with study drug). Patients who fulfill all of the inclusion and none&#xD;
      of the exclusion criteria will be accepted on to the study. Patients who fail the renal or&#xD;
      hematological function criteria may be re-screened if these parameters improve and if they&#xD;
      are still being treated with Valcyte®. The following procedures will be performed to&#xD;
      establish each patient's general health and eligibility for enrollment into the study: Record&#xD;
      medical history, including etiology of end-stage organ disease, details of transplant (date&#xD;
      and type), any previous disease (including CMV) and treatments, immunosuppressive drugs and&#xD;
      doses within the previous month or from transplantation, whichever is the shorter, Record CMV&#xD;
      serology of donor and recipient., perform physical examination; record demographic&#xD;
      information including sex, age and race/ethnicity; Obtain vital signs, height and weight;&#xD;
      Draw blood samples for laboratory screening of hematology (about one teaspoon of blood) and&#xD;
      routine serum chemistry, including calculation of estimated creatinine clearance; Obtain a&#xD;
      mid-stream urine sample for urinalysis and a pregnancy test (females only). This visit will&#xD;
      take about 30 minutes. Patient will be seen while in hospital by the research coordinators&#xD;
      and research physicians, while recovering from the kidney transplant procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will come to the GCRC the evening before, or during the morning of Day 1, within 14&#xD;
      days of screening. The following procedures will be carried out on all patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment that the patient is on stable calcineurin inhibitors and Valganciclovir&#xD;
           therapy ( ≥ 4 days); assignment of patient identification number; physical examination;&#xD;
           concomitant medication since the last visit will be collected; vital signs and weight;&#xD;
           blood samples for hematology and serum chemistry (5 cc); mid-stream sample of urine for&#xD;
           urinalysis and pregnancy testing (females of childbearing potential only); and&#xD;
           breakfast.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study drug will be administered (either two Valganciclovir tablets or 900 mg (18 mL) of&#xD;
           syrup formulation of Valganciclovir) with breakfast (must be within 15 minutes of&#xD;
           completion of breakfast). Adverse events and concomitant medications will be recorded.&#xD;
           Patients may be discharged after dosing. This visit will take about 2-3 hours to&#xD;
           complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Days 2, 4 and 6&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will return to the GCRC during the morning of these days. The following procedures&#xD;
      will be carried out on all patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre-dose PK blood sample for determination of trough levels of ganciclovir (5cc)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Breakfast will start within 15 minutes of the pre-dose PK blood sample. The study drug&#xD;
           (either two Valganciclovir tablets or 900 mg (18 mL) of syrup formulation of&#xD;
           Valganciclovir) will be administered with breakfast (must be within 15 minutes of&#xD;
           completion of breakfast).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The following procedures will be carried out after dosing: pharmacokinetic blood samples&#xD;
           (total blood collected each day is 11cc) for determination of plasma levels of&#xD;
           ganciclovir 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 6.0, 8.0, and 12 hours post-dose (time&#xD;
           windows of ± 5 minutes are allowed for all samples up to 4 hours and ± 20 minutes for&#xD;
           samples between 6 and 12 hours)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse events and concomitant medications will be documented. Patients may be&#xD;
           discharged after the 12-hour sample. This day will take twelve -thirteen hours to&#xD;
           complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Days 3 and 5&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will return to the GCRC during the morning. The following procedures will be carried&#xD;
      out on all patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vital signs and weight; 24 hour PK blood sample (± 30 minutes) for determination of&#xD;
           trough levels of ganciclovir before dosing with the next formulation of study drug&#xD;
           (1cc); Breakfast will start within 15 minutes of the pre-dose PK blood sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study drug will be administer (either two Valganciclovir tablets or 900 mg (18 mL) of&#xD;
           syrup formulation of Valganciclovir) with breakfast (must be within 15 minutes of&#xD;
           completion of breakfast). Adverse events and concomitant medications will be recorded.&#xD;
           Patients may be discharged after dosing. This visit will take about 2-3 hours to&#xD;
           complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 7&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will return to the GCRC during the morning. The following procedures will be carried&#xD;
      out on all patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood samples for hematology and serum chemistry (5cc); mid-stream sample of urine for&#xD;
           urinalysis; 24 hour PK blood sample (± 30 minutes) for determination of trough levels of&#xD;
           ganciclovir before dosing (5cc). Breakfast will start within 15 minutes of the pre-dose&#xD;
           PK blood sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two Valcyte® tablets will be administered (supplied by the center) with breakfast (must&#xD;
           be within 15 minutes of completion of breakfast). Adverse events and concomitant&#xD;
           medications will be recorded and patients may then be discharged from the GCRC. This&#xD;
           visit will take about 2-3 hours to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the Study The following safety assessments will be made throughout the study, from&#xD;
      screening to follow-up, as applicable: adverse events (AE's), including rejection and graft&#xD;
      loss, opportunistic infections (CMV and others) and treatments; concomitant treatments,&#xD;
      including immunosuppressive therapy (induction, maintenance and treatment of rejection) and&#xD;
      patient survival will be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Phase Patients will return between Days 13 to 20 for follow-up. The follow-up&#xD;
      procedures will include a physical examination, body weight, vital signs, clinical laboratory&#xD;
      safety tests (hematology, serum chemistry and urinalysis) (5cc), urine pregnancy test&#xD;
      (females of childbearing potential only) and the recording of adverse events and concomitant&#xD;
      medications. Once this visit is complete the patient will have completed the study. This&#xD;
      visit should take about one hour to complete.&#xD;
