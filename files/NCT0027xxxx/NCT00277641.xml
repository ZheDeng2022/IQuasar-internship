  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is to evaluate the effectiveness, tolerability, and safety of lamotrigine&#xD;
      therapy in the treatment of binge eating disorder associated with obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lamotrigine has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of&#xD;
      bipolar disorder, but has not been approved for use in the treatment of binge eating disorder&#xD;
      with obesity.&#xD;

      This is a 17-week, parallel group, placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      flexible-dose, single-center study. It begins with a 1 to 2 week screening period during&#xD;
      which there will be washout of other medications and evaluation of protocol-specified&#xD;
      criteria. The screening period will consist of at least two visits, which will include the&#xD;
      initial screening visit and the baseline (week 1) visit. The treatment period follows the&#xD;
      screening period and will last 16 weeks. Once a subject enters the treatment phase (after&#xD;
      randomization) the dosage of study medication will be 25 mg/qHS (or one placebo tablet at&#xD;
      night) for 14 days. On day 14 (visit 2 or the beginning of week 3), the dosage will be&#xD;
      increased, as tolerated, to 25 mg b.i.d. On day 28 (visit 4 or in the beginning of week 5),&#xD;
      the dosage will be increased, as tolerated, to 50 mg b.i.d. On day 35 (visit 5 or the&#xD;
      beginning of week 6), the dosage will be increased, as tolerated, to 100 mg b.i.d. The dosage&#xD;
      may be decreased at any time because of side effects. If the patient prefers, he or she may&#xD;
      take all of his or her daily dose of medication in the morning or evening. If no response or&#xD;
      an inadequate response (&lt; 50% reduction in binge eating episodes compared with baseline) is&#xD;
      evident by week 6 (visit 6), study medication may be increased to 150 mg b.i.d. If no&#xD;
      response or an inadequate response is evident by week 8 (visit 7), study medication may be&#xD;
      increased to 200 mg b.i.d. During weeks 12 through 16 (maintenance period) the dosage will&#xD;
      not be changed unless a medical reason (e.g., adverse effect) requires such a change. The&#xD;
      minimum dosage allowed will be 50 mg/day and the maximum dosage allowed will be 400 mg/day.&#xD;
      The 16-week treatment period will be followed by medication discontinuation and evaluation 1&#xD;
      week after medication discontinuation (week 17). Efficacy and safety evaluations will be done&#xD;
      at each visit starting with the baseline visit through week 17 (baseline, weeks 1, 2, 3, 4,&#xD;
      5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients will meet DSM-IV-TR criteria for BED for at least the last 6 months,&#xD;
             determined by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR (SCID) (61) and&#xD;
             supported by the Eating Disorder Examination (EDE) (62). These criteria are as&#xD;
             follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Recurrent episodes of binge eating. An episode of binge eating is characterized&#xD;
                  by both of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  eating, in discrete period of time (e.g., within any two hour period), an&#xD;
                       amount of food that is definitely larger than most people would eat in a&#xD;
                       similar period of time under similar circumstances&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  a sense of lack of control over eating during the episode (e.g., a feeling&#xD;
                       that one cannot stop eating or control what or how much one is eating)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The binge eating episodes are associated with at least three of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  eating much more rapidly than normal&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  eating until uncomfortably full&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  eating large amounts of food when not feeling physically hungry&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
                    -  feeling disgusted with oneself, depressed, or feeling very guilty after&#xD;
                       overeating&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Marked distress regarding binge eating.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Does not occur exclusively during the course of bulimia nervosa and anorexia&#xD;
                  nervosa.&#xD;
