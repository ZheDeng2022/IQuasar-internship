      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, topotecan, and cisplatin, work in&#xD;
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping&#xD;
      them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving paclitaxel together with topotecan&#xD;
      and cisplatin works in treating patients with advanced, persistent, or recurrent cervical&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estimate the antitumor activity of the combination of paclitaxel, topotecan, and&#xD;
           cisplatin in patients with advanced, persistent, or recurrent carcinoma of the cervix.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the nature and degree of toxicity for this drug regimen in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the duration of progression-free survival and overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the impact of prior chemoradiation on response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour followed by topotecan IV over 30 minutes and&#xD;
      cisplatin IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 8. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 66 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;

               -  Histologic confirmation of the original primary tumor is required&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Disease must be measurable in at least one dimension by conventional techniques,&#xD;
             including palpation, plain x-ray, CT scan, or MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Measurable disease is defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Tumors within a previously irradiated field will be designated as &quot;non-target&quot;&#xD;
                  lesions unless progression is documented or a biopsy is obtained to confirm&#xD;
