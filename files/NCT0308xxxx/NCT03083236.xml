      The aim of the study is to evaluate the impact of parent based intervention on the language&#xD;
      of 2 to 3 year old children from socially disadvantaged populations with a clinical diagnosis&#xD;
      of primary language delay.&#xD;

      This project is original in proposing to evaluate the effectiveness of a parent-based&#xD;
      intervention for a clinical population of 2 to 3 year olds with a diagnosis of primary&#xD;
      language delay in areas of social disadvantage. It is original in developing an interagency,&#xD;
      integrated model of delivery in line with the health and social care agenda (NHS 5 Year&#xD;
      Forward Plan). It is also original in examining the effect of parent attitudes on child&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;

    <description>The planned primary outcome measure for the proposed RCT is a quantitative measure of child language using a standardised assessment measure, The Pre-School Language Scales 5 UK (PLS 5 UK) (Zimmerman et al, 2014). This will provide a sound measure of reliability and validity.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion criteria (to diagnose primary language delay):&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The child is 24-36 months old&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The child has little or no expressive language (a vocabulary of 40 or less single&#xD;
             words)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The child has no known aetiologyÍ¾ the language delay is not secondary to sensory,&#xD;
             structural, neurological or cognitive impairments&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The family have been assessed as having low socioeconomic status The study will use&#xD;
             the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) as a basis to determining a measure of&#xD;
             deprivation. The IMD combines information from seven domains (income, employment,&#xD;
             education, health, crime, housing and living environment) to produce an overall&#xD;
             measure and it ranks how deprived areas are relative to others. This will be used to&#xD;
             determine which areas and Children's Centres will be involved in the proposed RCT.&#xD;
             However, as this is a geographical ranking, the RCT will include further refinement of&#xD;
             eligibility of social disadvantage via assessment of individual measures of income&#xD;
             deprivation, employment deprivation and education attainment. This information on&#xD;
             employment and parent education levels will be collected via the case history taken at&#xD;
             the initial assessment, as this is standard practice in a profile of risk for child&#xD;
             language delay. The additional information on income will be taken at the first&#xD;
             research assessment, as this does not form part of standard practice&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The child's expressive language consists of a vocabulary of more than 40 single words&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The child's language delay is secondary to sensory, structural, neurological or&#xD;
             cognitive impairments&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  English is not the first language for the family.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Where English is not the first language, children would be excluded. Adjustments to&#xD;
             the protocol and delivery of intervention would be required where English is an&#xD;
             additional language (EAL) and there is a need to test the intervention first on an&#xD;
             English-speaking population. If effective, a longer term programme plan would be to&#xD;
             amend the programme and evaluate the effectiveness with EAL children.&#xD;
