      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of chemotherapeutic&#xD;
      pancreatic cyst ablation using ethanol lavage followed by the infusion of a dual-agent&#xD;
      chemotherapeutic cocktail (paclitaxel + gemcitabine) compared with alcohol-free saline lavage&#xD;
      followed by infusion of the same dual-agent chemotherapeutic cocktail (paclitaxel +&#xD;
      gemcitabine) for the ablation of pancreatic cystic neoplasms using endoscopic ultrasound&#xD;
      guided fine needle infusion (EUS-FNI) for agent delivery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cystic lesions are increasingly encountered and typically discovered incidentally&#xD;
      on cross-sectional imaging, occurring in approximately 2% of all American adults with a 37%&#xD;
      prevalence in individuals over 80. Most of these cysts are mucinous (neoplastic) in origin&#xD;
      and represent precursor lesions for pancreatic adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discovering a pancreatic cyst typically presents a treatment dilemma, with options including&#xD;
      either indefinite radiographic surveillance with MR (magnetic resonance) or CT imaging or&#xD;
      surgical resection, both of which have significant limitations. Surveillance carries&#xD;
      significant economic and possible psychological burdens while waiting for signs of malignancy&#xD;
      to develop, as well as radiation exposure with computed tomography. On the other hand,&#xD;
      surgical resection possesses a significant risk of serious adverse events (20%-40%) and&#xD;
      mortality (1-2%). This clinical dilemma delineates the pressing need to develop effective,&#xD;
      but more minimally invasive approaches for the elimination of these premalignant pancreatic&#xD;
      cysts, and among these, endoscopic ultrasound guided fine needle infusion (EUS-FNI) has&#xD;
      emerged as an innovative and promising approach. Between November 2011 and December 30, 2015,&#xD;
      investigators from interventional endoscopy, surgical oncology, hematology oncology, and&#xD;
      pathology of the Penn State Hershey Medical Center conducted the CHARM I clinical trial. This&#xD;
      was a prospective, randomized, double-blind, single-center study with an N of 46 patients&#xD;
      required for 80% power to prove non-inferiority. Final results from CHARM I were as follows:&#xD;
      Patients treated included 23 females and 16 males with the majority of lesions located in the&#xD;
      body and head of the pancreas. Both the alcohol and alcohol-free groups recorded a 47% rate&#xD;
      of complete ablation at 6 months, which increased to 64% for both groups at the 1 year&#xD;
      follow-up. One subject experienced a complication in the alcohol arm (6%), and no subjects&#xD;
      experienced complications in the alcohol-free arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall objectives of CHARM II are to verify the significant findings of CHARM I in a&#xD;
      multi-center clinical trial as requested by national investigators in this field. We expect&#xD;
      that administering a specifically designed chemotherapeutic cocktail without prior ethanol&#xD;
      lavage will result in an equivalent rate of cyst resolution with fewer complications when&#xD;
      compared with lavage using alcohol. The results of this study will provide important&#xD;
      information about the most efficient and safest method for treating premalignant pancreatic&#xD;
      cysts, an important step for treating these lesions with a minimally invasive technique and&#xD;
      preventing their progression to pancreatic cancer. Standard alternative treatment options for&#xD;
      this patient group (if not taking part in this study) would be ongoing periodic radiographic&#xD;
      surveillance with MR or CT imaging waiting for signs of malignancy to develop or to consider&#xD;
      surgical resection (an option with significant rates of morbidity and mortality).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigator-initiated, prospective, randomized, double-blinded, multi-center&#xD;
      study evaluating ethanol lavage and chemotherapy for the ablation of mucinous and&#xD;
      indeterminate type pancreatic cysts with malignant potential. Participants will be screened&#xD;
      for the study according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. After confirming their&#xD;
      eligibility, patients will be randomized to one of the following EUS-FNI treatment arms in a&#xD;
      1:1 ratio:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control arm: After removal of cyst fluid, cysts will be lavaged for 3 to 5 minutes with 98%&#xD;
      ethanol and then infused with an admixture of 3 mg/ml paclitaxel and 19 mg/ml gemcitabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental arm: After removal of cyst fluid, cysts will be lavaged for 3 to 5 minutes with&#xD;
      normal saline and then infused with an admixture of 3 mg/ml paclitaxel and 19 mg/ml&#xD;
      gemcitabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be contacted by the study team via phone call at both 72 hours and 30 days&#xD;
      after their EUS procedure to assess any adverse events that may have occurred. Within 2-3&#xD;
      weeks of the having the EUS procedure, patients will receive the cyst fluid pathology&#xD;
      results. At 3 months after the initial procedure, patients will undergo a follow-up EUS&#xD;
      examination in the same manner as the initial EUS exam. During this exam, a complete&#xD;
      pancreaticobiliary evaluation will be conducted, and the diameter of the previously treated&#xD;
      cyst will be measured in the x and y dimensions to assess the 3 month response. Any cyst&#xD;
      still &gt;15mm and amenable to repeat ablation will undergo a second EUS-guided chemoablation&#xD;
      treatment using the same lavage that the patient was randomized to initially. At both 12&#xD;
      months and 24 months after the initial procedure, the patient will be seen in the GI clinic&#xD;
      and undergo either an MRI-MRCP (magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography) or enhanced CT&#xD;
      scan for a full pancreaticobiliary evaluation to assess the end-point treatment response.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Known or suspected pancreatic cancer or pathologic lymphadenopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cysts with the following high-risk features: main pancreatic duct dilation of &gt; 5mm,&#xD;
             epithelial type mural nodules (&gt; 2mm)33, pathologically thick wall/septation (&gt; 2mm),&#xD;

             note, the following higher-risk features ARE eligible: recent growth in size, atypical&#xD;
             cells on cytology, and symptoms referable to the pancreas.)&#xD;
