  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oxycodone and Hydrocodone are the most commonly used oral opioid analgesics in the emergency&#xD;
      department and in outpatient settings. Both medications have a very high potential for abuse&#xD;
      due to the prominence of the euphoric effect (abuse liability) and relative lack of &quot;bad &quot;or&#xD;
      &quot;negative&quot; effects (likeability). The highly addictive properties of these medications lead&#xD;
      to recurrent ED visits for repetitive dosing and prescribing that may lead to abuse, misuse,&#xD;
      development of dependence and addiction, and, most importantly, death due to overdose. In&#xD;
      contrast, several research papers demonstrated that administration of MSIR results in similar&#xD;
      analgesic efficacy to Oxycodone and Hydrocodone but with significantly less euphoric and&#xD;
      rewarding associated effects. In addition, consumption of large doses of MSIR leads to&#xD;
      dysphoria, vomiting and sedation (&quot;negative effects&quot;). To the investigators' knowledge, there&#xD;
      are no randomized controlled trials in the ED that directly compared analgesic efficacy of&#xD;
      MSIR to Percocet&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators' hypothesis is that MSIR coupled with acetaminophen will have similar if&#xD;
      not better analgesic efficacy at 30 minutes and 1 hour than oxycodone coupled with&#xD;
      acetaminophen for acute painful conditions in the emergency department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be a double-blind randomized clinical trial evaluation analgesic efficacy of&#xD;
      orally administered MISIR+acetaminophen in comparison to Oxycodone+acetaminophen for treating&#xD;
      pain. Patients will be enrolled from a single ED in a tertiary academic center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients based on inclusion criteria will be randomized to receive either 1 tablet of 15mg PO&#xD;
      morphine sulfate immediate release combined with 650mg of Acetaminophen or 1 tablet 10mg&#xD;
      Oxycodone combined with 650 mg Acetaminophen. All drugs will be crushed and given to the&#xD;
      subjects in blinded fashion. Patients, physicians, nurses and research assistants will be&#xD;
      blinded to drug assignment throughout the study. Medication will be prepared by on site&#xD;
      pharmacist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain will be reassessed at both 30 minutes, 45 minutes and 1 hour with the primary outcome of&#xD;
      reduction in pain score by 1.3 points at 60 minutes. Assuming a 1.7 pain difference is&#xD;
      minimally significant clinically with standard deviation of 3.0 (based on a previous study of&#xD;
      morphine analgesia), a minimum of 50 patients per group will be needed for 80% power with&#xD;
      alpha equal to 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes will include any reported adverse effects; the requirement of additional&#xD;
      analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Generalized likability and chance of repeated use will be reported by using a visual analogue&#xD;
      scale with following questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Do you feel any DRUG EFFECT?&quot; &quot;Do you LIKE the drug?&quot; &quot;How HIGH are you?&quot; &quot;Does the drug&#xD;
      have any GOOD EFFECTS?&quot; &quot;Does the drug have any BAD EFFECTS?&quot; &quot;How much do you DESIRE the&#xD;
      medication?&quot; &quot; Does the drug make you have UNPLEASANT THOUGHTS?&quot; &quot;Does the drug make you have&#xD;
      UNPLEASANT BODILY SENSATIONS?&quot; &quot;Does the drug make you feel IRRITATED?&quot; &quot;Does the drug make&#xD;
      it DIFFICULT TO CONCENTRATE?&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will respond by positioning an arrow along a 100-point line labeled with &quot;not at&#xD;
      all&quot; at one end and &quot;extremely&quot; at the other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analyzed by intention to treat and will include frequency distributions, and&#xD;
      Student's T-test to assess a difference in pain scores and vital signs. The chi-square test&#xD;
      will assess the presence or absence of side effects between the two groups. Statistical&#xD;
      analyses will be conducted by the research manager and the hospital senior biostatistician&#xD;
      who will be independent of all data collection.&#xD;
