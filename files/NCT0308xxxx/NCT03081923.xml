      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prognosis of pts who have failed multiple chemotherapy (CT) regimens is quite dismal.&#xD;
      PD-L1 is frequently expressed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in germ cell tumors (GCT). D is a&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody (mAb) that inhibits the binding of PD-L1. T, an anti-CTLA4 mAb, is an&#xD;
      immunomodulatory therapy. Combination immunotherapy has shown improved activity compared to&#xD;
      monotherapy. The investigators aimed to investigate the activity of D, alone or in&#xD;
      combination with T, in chemorefractory GCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open-label, randomized, 3-stage, phase 2 study. Pts who have failed ≥2 prior CT&#xD;
      regimens (including high-dose CT) will be randomized to receive one of the following: D, 1.5&#xD;
      g via IV infusion q4w, for up to a total of 12 months (13 doses/cycles) alone or with T, 75&#xD;
      mg IV q4w, starting on week 0, for up to 4 months (4 doses/cycles). Serum tumor markers,&#xD;
      computed tomography and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scans will&#xD;
      be repeated q8 weeks. The primary endpoint is the objective response-rate (ORR=complete&#xD;
      response or partial response with normal markers). H0: ORR rate ≤10%, H1: ORR ≥25%, type I&#xD;
      and II error rates at 10%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In stage 1, 11 pts will be allocated in each arm. According to Gehan's rule, the trial will&#xD;
      be terminated whenever no response will be observed. 29 additional pts will be added to each&#xD;
      arm fulfilling stage 1 criteria. ORR in ≥7 pts will be required. In stage 3, pts from stage&#xD;
      1-2 of both arms will be retrospectively evaluated for Programmed cell Death Ligand-1(PD-L1)&#xD;
      IHC. The Ventana PD-L1 IHC assay will be used. In case of negative findings at the end of&#xD;
      stage 2, if the target benefit is likely to occur only in PD-L1+ pts, further study&#xD;
      prosecution in accordance with an enrichment strategy will be undertaken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In particular, predictive power (PP) will be calculated assuming expansion of PD-L1+ cohorts&#xD;
      up to a maximum of 60 pts. Each arm will be categorized as not promising (PP&lt;30%) or&#xD;
      promising (PP ≥30%). The promising one will enter the stage 3. Should both arms be judged&#xD;
      promising, the one yielding ≥20% PP advantage will be selected; monotherapy will be preferred&#xD;
      otherwise. Details on the algorithm to be used for PD-L1 IHC in this study will be finalized&#xD;
      (EudraCT number 2016-001688-35).&#xD;
