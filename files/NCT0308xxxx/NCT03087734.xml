  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pectus excavatum (PE) is the most common deformity of the chest wall, occurring in&#xD;
      approximately 1/1000 people. Currently, surgical treatment by minimally invasive technique is&#xD;
      consolidating as preferred technique for the treatment of this condition. In this technique a&#xD;
      metal bar is inserted in retrosternal position, pushing the sternum without the necessity of&#xD;
      resecting the condral cartilages. Despite the advantages obtained with this technique, it is&#xD;
      not without complications and the displacement of the bar is one of the most important. In&#xD;
      order to minimize this problem we developed a new model of stabilizers, as well as all&#xD;
      necessary instruments for performing minimally invasive surgery. The aim of this study is to&#xD;
      compare two surgical groups, one making use of the new oblique stabilizer compared to the&#xD;
      conventional perpendicular stabilizer to determine which one has less displacement.&#xD;
      Furthermore, this study also aims to assess the full range of instruments developed by a&#xD;
      national company, to carry out this type of surgery, which has cost compatible with our&#xD;
      economic reality, and that can be accessible to our Public Health patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Introduction Pectus excavatum (PE) is presented as a sunken sternum in the midline and these&#xD;
      chest deformities are not uncommon, occurring in approximately 1/1000.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is commonly accepted that the abnormal growth of condral cartilage results in displacement&#xD;
      of the sternum. Most patients and their parents seek medical advice for psychosocial&#xD;
      concerns, particularly related to the cosmetic aspects and the consequent aversion to sports&#xD;
      or public exposure. Physiological tests are often normal, but both the cardiac index and&#xD;
      pulmonary function may be affected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical treatment of pectus excavatum Nuss broke the paradigm in PE surgery with the&#xD;
      publication of their results using a technique called minimally invasive. This technique&#xD;
      involves lateral incisions in the chest and the placement of one or two temporary steel bars,&#xD;
      which are shaped during surgery, specifically for each patient. These bars are placed in&#xD;
      retrosternal position and the sternum is elevated without the need of cartilage resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This surgical technique, in addition to the bars and stabilizers, needs a set of instruments&#xD;
      that are used in the customization of the bar for each patient and, after three years, the&#xD;
      withdrawal of the bar at the end of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another problem refers to the displacement of the metallic bars that are positioned under the&#xD;
      sternum and that are held in position by placing stabilizers, one at each lateral end of the&#xD;
      bar. These stabilizers, which are perpendicular to the bar, has the function to expand its&#xD;
      area of contact with the chest wall in order to prevent it from moving from its position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to increase the stability of the bar, preventing their movement, various&#xD;
      modifications have been proposed. The investigators believe that further modification can be&#xD;
      introduced. If the stabilizer metal bar has an oblique position relative to the bar (rather&#xD;
      than perpendicular as it is currently) it will be perpendicular to the ribs, thus increasing&#xD;
      its area of contact with the chest wall, which might bring more stability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are also proposing that the new metal bar that is being developed is&#xD;
      completely smooth, not having the usual slots that the current model has at the extremities&#xD;
      of the bars. The reason for this is to try to prevent bleeding during bars withdrawal after 3&#xD;
      years of use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another proposed amendment is a pressure screw incorporated into the stabilizer itself.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Search object The object of research is the development of a new model of metallic bar and&#xD;
      stabilizers, as well as dedicated surgical instruments whose purpose is to perform minimally&#xD;
      invasive repairs of PE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Social relevance One of the reasons why the Public Health in Brazil gives no coverage for&#xD;
      this type of surgical treatment for patients with PE is the high cost of surgical equipment&#xD;
      that is imported. The development of this material in the country, as is being proposed in&#xD;
      this project, has high social relevance that may represent savings by avoiding the purchase&#xD;
      of imported material and the possibility of making available this type of surgical treatment&#xD;
      for patients served by our public health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Site of the search The research will be performed in the Department of Thoracic Surgery,&#xD;
      Heart Institute (InCor) of the Hospital das Clinicas, Faculty of Medicine, University of São&#xD;
      Paulo.&#xD;
