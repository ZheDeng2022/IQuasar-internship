  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The researchers recognized the possible clinical usefulness of a shielded device or jig to&#xD;
      help increase the accuracy but decrease the time of loading the seeds into the biocompatible&#xD;
      material used intra-operatively. Therefore, the researchers created a prototype of a device&#xD;
      called the GammaTile (GT) loader (design patent pending). The reusable device will be made of&#xD;
      surgical quality stainless steel of sufficient thickness (greater than 10 half-value layers&#xD;
      (HVL) to provide significant staff and user shielding as well as allowing it to be&#xD;
      sterilized. It is utilized intraoperatively but off of the operative field and has no direct&#xD;
      patient contact. Currently two sizes are planned. The first will accommodate a 2 inch x 2&#xD;
      inch collagen square and the second will accommodate a 1 inch x 1 inch collagen square. These&#xD;
      are the most commonly used sizes of lyophilized collagen used in the Barrow Neurosurgical&#xD;
      Institute (BNI) operating rooms (OR).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 100 patient observational-design study for the purpose of testing the seed loader&#xD;
      device as a method of arranging and securing the seeds in a carrier in a set pattern for the&#xD;
      convenient use of the neurosurgeon against the backdrop of a hodgepodge of currently&#xD;
      available techniques (seed in suture, seed in mesh, loose seeds), all of which currently need&#xD;
      to be secondarily secured with some additional, not currently standardized material, in a&#xD;
      cumbersome, time-consuming, and not assuredly accurate manner. An additional primary&#xD;
      objective will be an assessment of the loader device as a radiation protection tool for the&#xD;
      user and staff during seed placement in the carrier and prior to intracranial carrier&#xD;
      placement. Secondary objectives will be conformality of pre- and post-implant dosimetry&#xD;
      (expected vs achieved) and post implant stability (seed shift) over time as judged on a&#xD;
      routine follow up MRI. An additional proposed endpoint is an economic (cost) comparison to&#xD;
      other modalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients are those deemed appropriate for and scheduled to undergo adjuvant&#xD;
      brachytherapy of the central nervous system as determined by the radiation oncologist and&#xD;
      neurosurgeon. Potential candidates will have a lesion(s) that may be newly diagnosed or&#xD;
      recurrent, in need of gross total or near gross total resection, and such that in the opinion&#xD;
      of the operating surgeon it would be both amenable to and in need of the proposed treatment.&#xD;
      Informed consent will be obtained. Radiation oncologist and neurosurgeon will determine&#xD;
      appropriateness of the proposed procedure and the radiation oncologist and neurosurgeon will&#xD;
      determine the volume and configuration of the area to be implanted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A carrier using currently available material (lyophilized bovine-derived collagen, Duraform&#xD;
      or similar) stocked in the BNI OR. The isotope (seeds) are also already approved for use&#xD;
      anywhere in the body, are in use and on the hospital's radioactive materials license (RML).&#xD;
      Patients will have pre- and post-operative computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI) as routine care, and post-operative CT's as per routine implant case dosimetry.&#xD;
      All applicable radiation safety procedures will continue to be followed. The sterilizable&#xD;
      loader(s) will be provided as a non-charge-item, and are anticipated to be classified as a&#xD;
      &quot;Class 1&quot; device by the FDA as they are not implanted and have no direct patient contact.&#xD;

    <description>Patients are chosen based on symptomatic tumor/radiographic finding of a surgically accessible mass. Surgery will be done in usual fashion. A cavity will be left where the tumor was. Size of operative bed will be measured using a surgical dissector and standard operating room ruler. A sheet of surgical fabric may be used to estimate size of cavity. If pathology is positive the study treatment will continue. If not, patient will not be on trial. If patient is eligible, radiation oncologist will form custom implants using a seed(s) of Cesium-131, with other biocompatible materials used to achieve maximum dosimetric conformality. Surgeon will place constructs into cavity until the operative bed is fully addressed. Implant is not expected to migrate. Surgicel, bioglue or similar material may be used to secure seeds. Wound will be closed in standard fashion. The last 10 patients will be asked to participate in an effort to gauge costs related to radiation portion of treatment.</description>
