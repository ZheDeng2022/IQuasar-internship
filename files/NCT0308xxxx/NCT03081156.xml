    <textblock>
      This trial is an investigator initiated study involving the use of the AstraZenica Aerophere&#xD;
      Inhaler (Glycopyrrolate/Formoterol) to determine the effect on exercise tolerance and dynamic&#xD;
      hyperinflation in patients with chronic obstructive lung disease.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have obstruction to expiratory&#xD;
      airflow, marked breathlessness, high dyspnea scores, and reduced exercise tolerance relative&#xD;
      to age and gender matched non-smoking controls (Casaburi, 2009; Casaburi et al., 2014;&#xD;
      Puente-Maestu et al., 2016). A prominent mechanism for exercise intolerance is thought to be&#xD;
      dynamic hyperinflation during exercise (an increase in the end-expiratory lung volume) that&#xD;
      contributes to the sensation of breathlessness, and ultimately results in early cessation of&#xD;
      exercise. A co-maladaptive mechanism of exercise limitation in COPD is related to wasted or&#xD;
      excessive ventilation at all work intensities from increased dead space ventilation relative&#xD;
      to total ventilation (increased VD/VT). This requirement for additional ventilation limits&#xD;
      exercise capacity and contributes to dynamic hyperinflation and ventilatory limitation&#xD;
      (O'Donnell et al., 2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment with individual bronchodilators, including short acting beta agonists (SABA), long&#xD;
      acting beta agonists (LABA), short acting muscarinic antagonists (SAMA) and long acting&#xD;
      muscarinic antagonists (LAMA) is effective in partially reversing the expiratory airflow&#xD;
      obstruction at rest and during exercise resulting in reduced dynamic hyperinflation. Because&#xD;
      beta-agonists and anticholinergics broncho-dilate synergistically, they are often used in&#xD;
      combination products (SABA+SAMA or LABA/LAMA). The optimal sustained bronchodilation effect&#xD;
      in COPD appears to be achieved by fixed dose, long acting combination medications&#xD;
      (LABA/LAMA). (Bateman et al., 2014; Casaburi, 2009; Casaburi et al., 2014; Cope et al., 2013;&#xD;
      Huisman et al., 2015). As dynamic hyperinflation appears to also be a limiting factor in&#xD;
      exercise tolerance, and LABA/LAMA preparations improve airflow during exercise, it appears&#xD;
      likely that use of a fixed-dose combination bronchodilator, BEVESPI AEROSPHERE ®&#xD;
      (Glycopyrrolate/Formoterol) will increase exercise tolerance and reduce hyperinflation in&#xD;
      COPD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that exercise tolerance in a constant work rate, high intensity&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary exercise test will be increased with BEVESPI AEROSPHERE ®&#xD;
      (Glycopyrrolate/Formoterol), and that the increase in exercise tolerance will be mediated by&#xD;
      a combination of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. reduced dynamic hyperinflation, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. decreased dead space ventilation (VD/VT) during exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the magnitude of exercise time improvement (seconds) with BEVESPI AEROSPHERE ®&#xD;
      (Glycopyrrolate/Formoterol) relative to placebo during high intensity, constant work rate&#xD;
      exercise in COPD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine if the VD/VT can be reliably assessed during constant work rate exercise using&#xD;
      transcutaneous CO2 measurement (tcpCO2) and, if so, if BEVESPI AEROSPHERE ®&#xD;
      (Glycopyrrolate/Formoterol) results in a reduction in VD/VT relative to placebo at isotime&#xD;
      during high intensity constant work rate exercise in COPD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tertiary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine if computerized assessment of the spontaneous expiratory flow-volume loop during&#xD;
      exercise can provide additional information about both dynamic hyperinflation and the effects&#xD;
      of BEVESPI AEROSPHERE ® (Glycopyrrolate/Formoterol) during high intensity, constant work rate&#xD;
      exercise in COPD patients.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. All patients must have a clinical diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&#xD;
             (COPD) and must meet the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Stable state of their disease with no exacerbation (antibiotics, oral steroids,&#xD;
                  ER visit, or hospitalization for COPD) within the previous 4 weeks; and&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. At visit 1 Spirometric Values must demonstrate a post-bronchodilator FEV1 between&#xD;
                  35% and 80% of predicted normal and a post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC &lt;70%. [The&#xD;
                  rationale for the lower limit is to exclude patients unlikely to tolerate&#xD;
                  withholding of long acting bronchodilators. The rationale for the upper limit is&#xD;
                  to exclude patients unlikely to be limited in their exercise tolerance by&#xD;
                  hyperinflation and air trapping.]&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Male or female patients, between 40 and 80 years (inclusive) of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients must be current or ex-smokers with a smoking history of more than 10&#xD;
             pack-years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients must be able to perform technically acceptable pulmonary function tests and a&#xD;
             symptom-limited cardiopulmonary cycle ergometry test.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients must be able to inhale medication in an acceptable manner from the metered&#xD;
             dose inhalers used in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with a significant disease other than COPD; a significant disease is defined&#xD;
             as a disease which, in the opinion of the investigator, may (i) put the patient at&#xD;
             risk because of participation in the study, (ii) influence the results of the study,&#xD;
             or (iii) cause concern regarding the patient's ability to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with a documented personal history of childhood asthma, a clinical&#xD;
             presentation consistent with asthma, and a family history of asthma. For patients with&#xD;
             allergic rhinitis, atopy, or prior allergy treatment, medical records will be obtained&#xD;
             to verify that the patient does not have asthma. The final determination on the&#xD;
             possibility of an overlap condition [Asthma-COPD Overlap Syndrome, (Postma and Rabe,&#xD;
             2015)], and thus, appropriateness for entry into the study, will be the principal&#xD;
             investigator's decision.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients with any of the following conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. A history of myocardial infarction within 1 year of screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Unstable or life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia.&#xD;

&#xD;
               4. Known active tuberculosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. A malignancy for which patient has undergone resection, radiation therapy or&#xD;
                  chemotherapy within the past 6 months (patients with treated local skin tumors&#xD;
                  are allowed).&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
              10. Any contraindications for exercise testing as outlined below (see&#xD;
                  contraindications to exercise).&#xD;
&#xD;
              11. Patients who have undergone thoracotomy with pulmonary resection in the past&#xD;
                  year.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients being treated with oral corticosteroid medication at unstable doses (i.e.,&#xD;
             less than six weeks on a stable dose) or at doses in excess of the equivalent of 10 mg&#xD;
             of prednisone per day or 20 mg every other day.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients who regularly use daytime oxygen therapy for more than 6 hours per day and in&#xD;
             the investigator's opinion will be unable to abstain from the use of oxygen therapy&#xD;
             during clinic visits and exercise testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients who desaturate to SpO2 &lt;80% on screening incremental exercise testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients who have completed a pulmonary rehabilitation program in the six weeks prior&#xD;
