  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate two groups of patients who have intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.&#xD;
      Each group will receive induction treatment with Cisplatin and Gemcitabine per SOC for 4&#xD;
      treatment cycles. Following induction treatment patients will be randomize (1:1), to 2 arms&#xD;
      of treatment. One group (50%) will be receive high dose chemotherapy delivered specifically&#xD;
      to the liver, while the other group (50%) will continue treatment with Cisplatin and&#xD;
      Gemcitabine. Patient in each group will get repeating cycles of treatment until the cancer&#xD;
      advances. All patients will be followed until death. This study will compare the overall&#xD;
      survival (OS) in patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist of 4 phases: a screening, an induction, randomization and follow-up&#xD;
      phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening phase: Screening assessments will be conducted within 28 days prior to initiation&#xD;
      of Induction Phase treatment to determine each patient's overall eligibility. These&#xD;
      assessments will include medical history; physical examination; Eastern Cooperative Oncology&#xD;
      Group (ECOG) performance status (PS); 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG); echocardiogram (ECHO);&#xD;
      vital signs; laboratory assessments; radiologic assessments of disease status; and an&#xD;
      evaluation of the vasculature compatibility for Percutaneous Hepatic Perfusion (PHP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Induction phase: The initial 12 weeks of the study, all patients will receive 4 cycles of&#xD;
      cisplatin/gemcitabine. Each cycle will be comprised of cisplatin dosed at 25 mg per square&#xD;
      meter of body-surface area (BSA), followed by gemcitabine dosed at 1000 mg per square meter&#xD;
      of BSA; dosing will occur on Days 1 and 8 of each cycle. At the completion of 3 cycles (week&#xD;
      8 (+1 week)) of cisplatin/gemcitabine, an imaging scan is performed as per standard of care&#xD;
      to determine if the patient has progressed on treatment or should continue receiving the&#xD;
      cisplatin/gemcitabine induction therapy for one more cycle (4th cycle - prior to&#xD;
      randomization). At the completion of 4 cycles (week 12 (+1 week)) of cisplatin/gemcitabine,&#xD;
      patients will undergo whole-body imaging to determine the status of their disease. Patients&#xD;
      with progressive disease (PD) will be discontinued from study treatment, and will receive&#xD;
      further treatment to be determined by the principal investigator (PI). They will continue to&#xD;
      be followed until death or the end of the study. Patients who have at least stable disease&#xD;
      (SD) at imaging after induction phase of 4 cycles of cisplatin/gemcitabine (week 12 (+ 1&#xD;
      week)) will go on to the next phase of the study (Randomized Treatment Phase).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization phase: Patients who have at least stable disease via imaging at the end of the&#xD;
      Induction Phase will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to Melphalan/HDS treatment or to continue&#xD;
      cisplatin/gemcitabine in cycles previously described in the Induction Phase, until&#xD;
      progressive disease (PD) or unacceptable toxicity is observed. Patients who were randomized&#xD;
      to treatment with Melphalan/HDS (dosed at 3.0 mg/kg Ideal Body Weight [IBW]) must undergo&#xD;
      their first treatment within 14 days following the whole body imaging performed at end of the&#xD;
      Induction Phase. For Melphalan/HDS treatment, patients will receive up to 6 treatments. Each&#xD;
      treatment cycle will consist of 6 weeks with an acceptable delay for up to another 2 weeks&#xD;
      before the next planned treatment to allow for additional recovery, if needed. After the&#xD;
      Melphalan/HDS treatment, in the absence of disease progression, the patient should undergo a&#xD;
      re-induction of CisGem. Tumor response will be assessed in both treatment arms every 8 weeks&#xD;
      (+ 1 week) until PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessment scans will be reviewed by Independent Review Committee (IRC). At any time when&#xD;
      PD is observed, the patient will be removed from further study treatment; any further&#xD;
      treatment will be at the discretion of the investigator. Melphalan/HDS treatment will also be&#xD;
      discontinued in the event that recovery requires more than 8 weeks from last treatment. An&#xD;
      end-of-treatment visit will be conducted approximately 6 to 8 weeks following the final dose&#xD;
      of study treatment. Ongoing adverse events (AEs) at the end-of-treatment visit will be&#xD;
      followed until the severity returns to common terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE)&#xD;
      Grade &lt; 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up phase: In the event that disease has not progressed at the end-of-treatment visit,&#xD;
      disease assessment scans will continue every 8 weeks (+ 1 week) until PD is documented.&#xD;
      Patients will be contacted by phone every 6 months for survival status for the first two&#xD;
      years following the completion of study treatment, then yearly thereafter until death,&#xD;
      withdrawal of informed consent or they become lost to follow-up, whichever occurs first.&#xD;
      Patients will be monitored for two years following the completion of study treatment for the&#xD;
      development of myelodysplasia and secondary leukemia.&#xD;
