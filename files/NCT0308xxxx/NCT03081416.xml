      This is a randomized, single-blind, placebo controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of&#xD;
      sub-dissociative dose ketamine versus standard care therapy for acute headache management of&#xD;
      in patients presenting to the emergency department with headache as the chief compliant.&#xD;
      Standard care will include 25 mg of diphenhydramine (DIP) IV, 10 mg of metoclopramide (MET)&#xD;
      IV, +/- 15-30 mg ketorolac and +/- 10 mg of dexamethasone (DEX) IV the discretion of the&#xD;
      treating provider. This study has been approved by Brooke Army Medical Center (BAMC)&#xD;
      institutional review board and clinicaltrials.gov registration is pending.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A convenience sample of patients 18 to 65 years of age with a chief complaint of headache&#xD;
      will be considered for enrollment. Potential subjects are those presenting to the SAMMC ED&#xD;
      with a chief complaint of headache. Attempts to engage subjects earlier in their ED Course&#xD;
      (EDC) will be made. This will mitigate interruptions in the subject's EDC, possible&#xD;
      withdrawals from the control group, and lack of subject interest in the study. The triage&#xD;
      nurse will inform the PI or AI of any patient presenting to the ED with a chief complaint of&#xD;
      headache. Patients meeting inclusion criteria will be provided with a brochure briefing them&#xD;
      on the study. If they are willing to participate, then a member of the research team will&#xD;
      obtain written consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient screening, enrollment, patient consents, and data collection will be performed by the&#xD;
      PI or AI. Each AI will complete training regarding study details, inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
      criteria, atomization, intranasal delivery, and ketamine pharmacokinetics which will be&#xD;
      conducted by the PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a patient is consented the team member will obtain a study packet, and the patient will&#xD;
      be assigned a study identification number. The study packet will contain the required forms,&#xD;
      surveys, Wand documentation forms. The study personnel will then write on the patient's&#xD;
      standard order sheet &quot;SDDK Protocol, Patent #__, __kg&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      All females of child-bearing age that have not had a hysterectomy or tubal ligation will&#xD;
      receive a pregnancy test. This is a standard test performed in the ED and considered part of&#xD;
      routine practice. A pregnancy test in females is one test that is required by all patients&#xD;
      undergoing this clearance among other labs not applicable to this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline pain score will be determined using a 100 mm visual analogue scale, described to the&#xD;
      patient as &quot;no pain&quot; being 0 and &quot;the worst pain imaginable&quot; being 100. A patient will be&#xD;
      determined as eligible for enrollment if a baseline VAS score of 50 or greater is reported. A&#xD;
      study investigator will then record the patient's body weight and baseline vital signs.&#xD;
      Additional demographics recorded will include age, gender, comorbid medical conditions and&#xD;
      headache classification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the subject is determined to meet the inclusion/exclusive criteria and has agreed to&#xD;
      participate in the study and has a signed consent form, the patient will be randomized via&#xD;
      permutated-block randomization into the ketamine or standard care treatment group. An&#xD;
      intravenous catheter will be initiated in each subject and 1000 mL normal saline IV bag will&#xD;
      started on each patient per provider discretion.62 Once the medication of either treatment&#xD;
      arm has been obtained and is ready to administer the PI or AI will document time zero.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard care arm will be administered 10mg of MET, 25 mg of DIP and +/- 15-30 mg of KET&#xD;
      and +/- 10mg of dexamethasone IV push. 10 mg of MET will be added to the 1000 mL normal&#xD;
      saline bag and infused as a bolus until the 1000 mL normal saline bag is empty. In addition,&#xD;
      the standard care arm will be administered same volume of atomized intranasal normal saline&#xD;
      as calculated dose of 0.75mg/kg ketamine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Ketamine arm will be administered intranasal SDDK via atomizer based on previous studies&#xD;
      regarding intranasal ketamine administration in the ED at an initial dose of 0.75 mg/kg.2 The&#xD;
      treating nurse will prepare the SDDK using the weight based dosing table found in each study&#xD;
      packet. The treating nurse will give the syringe with the SDDK to the AI/PI for verification&#xD;
      and administration. Each patient will also be administered 0.5ml, 0.5-1ml and 2.5ml normal&#xD;
      saline boluses in place of the DIP, +/- KET and +/- DEX for a maximum of three boluses. An&#xD;
      additional 2ml normal saline bolus will be added to the 1000 mL normal saline bag in place of&#xD;
      the MET and the 1000 mL normal saline bag will be infused as a bolus until the bag is empty.&#xD;
      Approximately 30 minutes after initial ketamine administration, study subjects will be asked&#xD;
      if they would like an additional dose of medication for their headache. If the study subject&#xD;
      request additional medication, the patient can receive a single repeat dose of 0.25mg/kg&#xD;
      intranasal ketamine . This time was chosen empirically as reasonable time frame for clinic&#xD;
      reassessment of analgesic affect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      60 minutes after all medications are given, subject participation in the study will be&#xD;
      concluded and routine ED care will be resumed. At this time each subject will be asked if&#xD;
      they would like additional medication for the treatment of their headache. If they would like&#xD;
      additional medication, rescue analgesia may be given at the discretion of the ED provider&#xD;
      managing the patient. Also, at any point the treating provider feels analgesia is inadequate&#xD;
      either by patient verbalization or provider assessment, rescue medications may be provided at&#xD;
      the treating provider's discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study investigators will record treatment arm pain scores, vital signs, and adverse effects&#xD;
      at 10, 30, 60 and 90 minutes. Total hospital course time will also be documented. Adverse&#xD;
      effects recorded will be based on the Side Effects Rating Scale for Dissociative Anesthetics&#xD;
      (SERDA) and will include fatigue, dizziness, nausea, headache, feelings of unreality, changes&#xD;
      in hearing, mood change, general discomfort and hallucinations. Although SERDA is frequently&#xD;
      reported on a five point scale, patients will be graded on the adverse effects by answering&#xD;
      &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;. An adverse effect will be considered serious if they resulted in clinical&#xD;
      symptoms that were unable to be abated with clinical intervention or the tincture of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time of discharge, a final pain score will be recorded using the 10 point numerical&#xD;
      rating score (NRS) with 0 meaning 'no pain' and 10 meaning &quot;the worse pain possible.&quot;&#xD;
      Patients will also be asked if they believed they got the study drug or standard care. A&#xD;
      final ED encounter satisfaction score will be recorded using a the 10 point numerical rating&#xD;
      score (NRS) with 0 meaning ' Very dissatisfied' and 1-0 meaning &quot;Very satisfied.&quot; Follow-up&#xD;
      will occur via telephone using the scripted phone conversation (included in this package) at&#xD;
      48-72 hours post-discharge. All subjects will be queried via a scripted interview for any&#xD;
      adverse effects using the SERDA elements and whether the patient continues to perceive&#xD;
      headache pain and duration of previous headache relief. Again, pain will be assessed using&#xD;
      the 10 point NRS. Additional information will be collected via follow up communication&#xD;
      including, but not limited to changes in medications, new diagnoses, unplanned visits or&#xD;
      admissions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject will be asked for contact information including phone numbers and email addresses for&#xD;
      follow-up. Phone contact will be the primary method of contact. If, after two phone call&#xD;
      attempts, the PI is unsuccessful at establishing patient contact, a scripted email be sent&#xD;
      requesting the subject contact the protocol staff to complete the survey. If patients are&#xD;
      unable to be contacted or lost to follow-up medical records will be queried for additional&#xD;
      contact phone numbers if available. Veteran's Affairs system will be searched if all other&#xD;
      methods are exhausted without result. The protocol team will attempt to contact the patient&#xD;
      for 5 days after their hospital discharge date. If the patient has not been contacted by this&#xD;
      time frame subjects will assumed to be lost to follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be the change in pain level as documented by the VAS from study&#xD;
      initiation to discharge. Secondary outcomes will include treatment efficiency (time to pain&#xD;
      relief), change of pain score from discharge to follow up and side effects profile using the&#xD;
      SERDSA questionnaire. All research will be completed when either the PI or AI are available&#xD;
      in the ED to enroll and consent patients.&#xD;
