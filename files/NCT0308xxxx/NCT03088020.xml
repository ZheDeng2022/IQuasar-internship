  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Center for Autonomic Medicine in Pediatrics (CAMP) has built the first International CCHS&#xD;
      (Congenital Central Hypoventilation Syndrome REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture)&#xD;
      Registry. This registry is an international collaboration with CCHS patients and their&#xD;
      physicians recruited from around the world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this IRB-approved research study is to gain a better understanding of the&#xD;
      various clinical manifestations of CCHS with advancing age, and as related to each patient's&#xD;
      specific PHOX2B mutation. With a better understanding of specific CCHS PHOX2B mutations and&#xD;
      associated disease manifestations, we will be able to better anticipate healthcare needs and&#xD;
      to provide more accurate guidelines to healthcare providers world-wide in caring for patients&#xD;
      with CCHS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to obtain detailed phenotypic information (information about health and&#xD;
      well-being) on patients with CCHS. Participation would require filling out a confidential&#xD;
      survey that asks questions regarding phenotype and past medical history. Involvement in the&#xD;
      project is completely voluntary and there is no compensation for taking part. However, this&#xD;
      project will help us learn more about this devastating disease, with the goal of advancing&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CCHS is a disorder characterized by alveolar hypoventilation with a control of breathing&#xD;
      deficit, and symptoms of autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysregulation (ANSD). This study aims&#xD;
      to develop a patient registry for CCHS, which will provide crucial insight into disease&#xD;
      development, improving outcome in these children through improving early recognition of the&#xD;
      disorder, understanding the phenotypic spectrum, and evolution of clinical course. Data will&#xD;
      be stored in REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) system a secure web application&#xD;
      designed exclusively to support data capture for research studies in a secure manner. The&#xD;
      REDCap server is hosted securely at Northwestern University, behind a firewall, with virus&#xD;
      protection, and using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) authentication to encrypt communication&#xD;
      between a user and the server. Protected Health Information (PHI) will be labeled as such in&#xD;
      the database and access to it will be restricted to the Principal Investigator (PI) and key&#xD;
      personnel participating in the consent process and follow up contact of participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the International CCHS REDCap Registry will be identified and recruited from&#xD;
      CAMP's registry of new, current, and past CCHS referrals, including CCHS patients referred&#xD;
      for PHOX2B testing and/or consultation. Additionally, patients may also be recruited via the&#xD;
      internet using emails, Facebook pages, and mailing lists for family groups. Anyone interested&#xD;
      will be offered inclusion into the International CCHS Registry. Participants will be able to&#xD;
      participate remotely, from their homes or locations where they have internet, phone, and&#xD;
      computer access.&#xD;
&#xD;
      De-identified data collected through the REDCap registry will be de-identified and analyzed.&#xD;
      Patients enrolled in this study will be offered participation in the NIH GRDR. This is an&#xD;
      optional part of the study, and is not required for inclusion. The Global Rare Disease&#xD;
      Registry (GRDR) is established by the NIH Office of Rare Disease Research. The goal of the&#xD;
      GRDR is to establish a data repository of de-identified patient data, aggregated in a&#xD;
      standardized manner, using Common Data Elements (CDEs) and standardized terminology.&#xD;
      De-identification of patient's data will utilize the Global Unique Identifiers (GUID) system.&#xD;
      Lurie Children's Hospital will retain ownership of all data shared with the GRDR. The&#xD;
      de-identified data in the GRDR will be available to all investigators to enable analyses&#xD;
      across many rare diseases and to facilitate various biomedical studies, including clinical&#xD;
      trials, in pursuit of developing drugs and therapeutics to improve the healthcare and the&#xD;
      quality of life for the many millions of people who are diagnosed with rare diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any patient agreeing to be part of the GRDR will have their data de-identified and this&#xD;
      de-identified data exported and shared with the GRDR. These participants are also given the&#xD;
      option to be contacted for participation in clinical trials. If this option is chosen, any&#xD;
      researcher accessing de-identified information through the GRDR and planning to conduct a&#xD;
      clinical trial will be allowed to contact the CAMP project coordinator to ask that patients&#xD;
      fitting the profile of needed participants be contacted and offered inclusion. No&#xD;
      de-identified information will be shared with researchers outside of CAMP, rather the CAMP&#xD;
      project coordinator will contact identified patients fitting participation criteria to share&#xD;
      contact information and details for the clinical trial. Interested patients will then be&#xD;
      given to the option to contact researchers conducting clinical trials at their discretion.&#xD;
