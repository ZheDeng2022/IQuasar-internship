    <textblock>
      Sleep apnea is a common and serious health problem in the Polish population. According to&#xD;
      epidemiological data problem concerns about 7% of the adult population. The most common sleep&#xD;
      disorder is obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The consequence of episodes of airway obstruction&#xD;
      and sleep fragmentation is an inefficient sleep, pathological daytime sleepiness, falling&#xD;
      asleep involuntarily, awakening with feelings of shortness of breath or throttling. The&#xD;
      direct consequences of sleep apnea are hypoxia, increased heart rate and increased blood&#xD;
      pressure. Frequent complications of OSA are hypertension, stroke, cardiac arrhythmia,&#xD;
      coronary artery disease and pulmonary hypertension. An additional problem in patients with&#xD;
      sleep apnea is an increased incidence of bruxism. Bruxism is a common problem; reports of&#xD;
      prevalence range from 8-31% in the general population. The most common symptoms of bruxism&#xD;
      include: hypersensitive teeth, tooth wear, damage to dental restorations (e.g. crowns and&#xD;
      fillings), damage to periodontal and oral mucosa, masticatory muscle pain and headaches. The&#xD;
      etiology of bruxism is multifactorial and not fully understood. It can be caused by biologic,&#xD;
      psychologic and exogenous factors. Arousals during the apnea episodes are considered to be a&#xD;
      major cause of sleep bruxism in OSA patients. The relationship between OSA and sleep bruxism&#xD;
      is still not clearly defined. Further research is needed to help explain the relationship&#xD;
      between these two phenomena, which will enable further therapy in patients with coexisting&#xD;
      OSA and sleep bruxism (SB).&#xD;

      1. Introduction Sleep apnea is a common and serious health problem in the Polish&#xD;
           population. According to epidemiological data problem concerns about 7% of the adult&#xD;
           population. The most common sleep disorder is obstructive sleep apnea (OBS). The&#xD;
           essences of OBS are episodes of airway obstruction repeated many times during sleep. As&#xD;
           a result the oxygen level in blood decreases. The result of increased muscle tension of&#xD;
           upper respiratory tract and throat vibrations is a very loud snoring restoring breath.&#xD;
           Episodes of apnea with arousals cause sleep fragmentation, shortage of deep sleep and&#xD;
           rapid eye movement (REM). Such episodes occur repeatedly, several, or even dozens of&#xD;
           times per hour of sleep. The consequence of episodes of airway obstruction and sleep&#xD;
           fragmentation is an inefficient, lack of rest sleep, pathological daytime sleepiness,&#xD;
           falling asleep involuntarily, awakening with feelings of shortness of breath or&#xD;
           throttling. Fragmentation of sleep and repeated episodes of hypoxia result in&#xD;
           deterioration of quality of life, chronic fatigue and an increased risk of communication&#xD;
           accidents.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The direct consequences of sleep apnea are hypoxia, awakening, increased heart rate and&#xD;
           increased blood pressure. Frequent complications of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) are&#xD;
           hypertension, stroke, cardiac arrhythmia, coronary artery disease, pulmonary&#xD;
           hypertension and heart failure. If left untreated, OSA contributes to the development of&#xD;
           vascular endothelial dysfunction and increases the risk of premature death, especially&#xD;
           in men under age of 50.&#xD;
&#xD;
           An additional problem in patients with sleep apnea is an increased incidence of bruxism.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Bruxism is a common problem; reports of prevalence range from 8-31% in the general&#xD;
           population. The most common symptoms of bruxism include: hypersensitive teeth, tooth&#xD;
           wear, damage to dental restorations (e.g. crowns and fillings), damage to periodontal&#xD;
           and oral mucosa, masticatory muscle pain and headaches. Symptoms of bruxism may go&#xD;
           unnoticed for a long time, which implies that patients often don't know about their&#xD;
           condition. There are two different types of bruxism: Sleep Bruxism (SB) and Awake&#xD;
           Bruxism (AB). Type SB consists of involuntary, episodic and rhythmic activity of&#xD;
           masticatory muscles (Rhythmic Masticatory Muscle Activity / RMMA).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The etiology of bruxism is multifactorial and not fully understood.It can be caused by&#xD;
           biologic, psychologic and exogenous factors. Arousals during the apnea episodes are&#xD;
           considered to be a major cause of sleep bruxism in OSA patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The relationship between obstructive sleep apnea and sleep bruxism is still not clearly&#xD;
           defined. Further research is needed to help explain the relationship between these two&#xD;
           phenomena, which will enable further therapy in patients with coexisting OSA and SB.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Aim The aim of the study is evaluation of the quality of sleep, endothelial function,&#xD;
           cardiovascular risk, thyroid function, a function of masticatory muscles,&#xD;
           psycho-emotional status, genetic predispositions and drug effectiveness in patients with&#xD;
           bruxism.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Methods The project will take place in the Sleep Laboratory at the Department of&#xD;
           Internal Medicine, Occupational Diseases and Hypertension Medical University in Wroclaw.&#xD;
           About 100 patients referred to the Department of Internal Medicine, Occupational&#xD;
           Diseases and Hypertension and Clinical Oncology for suspected sleep apnea and bruxism&#xD;
           will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients from the Clinic of Prosthodontics operating at the Department of Prosthodontics,&#xD;
      Medical University in Wroclaw and other dental institutions diagnosed using Diagnostic&#xD;
      Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders (DC / TMD) and Criteria of American Academy of Sleep&#xD;
      Medicine International Classification of Sleep Disorders ICSD-3 evaluating bruxism will&#xD;
      undergo polysomnography (PSG) with video recording.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Polysomnograms will be evaluated in a 30-second contributions, according to standard sleep&#xD;
      criteria. PSG results will contain data on the latency of sleep, total sleep time (TST),&#xD;
      sleep efficiency (%) and an evaluation of phases N1, N2, N3 and REM. Pathological respiratory&#xD;
      events will be evaluated in accordance with the standards of the American Academy of Sleep.&#xD;
      Apnea is defined as the absence of airflow through the respiratory tract by more than 10&#xD;
      seconds. The shallowness of breathing is defined as a decrease in respiratory amplitude by&#xD;
      more than 30% for more than 10 seconds, with subsequent desaturation of more than 3% or&#xD;
      subsequent awakening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then, to evaluate the function of vascular endothelium in patients expansion of the brachial&#xD;
      artery using ultrasonography Aloka Prosound Alpha 6, using the guidelines of the&#xD;
      international working group studying reactivity of the brachial artery will be explored.&#xD;
      Ultrasound of the heart, Electrocardiography Holter and Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring&#xD;
      (ABPM) will be performed in each patient. In addition, researchers will execute surveys:&#xD;
      Epworth Scale, Athens Scale, STOP-Bang Scale, Berlin questionnaire, the severity level of&#xD;
      fatigue / tiredness scale, a questionnaire assessing quality of life, the scale of perceived&#xD;
      stress - questionnaire PSS 10 and questionnaires Oral Behavior Checklist (OBC) and Pittsburgh&#xD;
      Sleep Quality index (PSQI). Headache episodes will be assessed using Headache Impact Test - 6&#xD;
      (HIT-6) and HUNT questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will be performed laboratory blood tests to determine levels of FT3, FT4 and TSH&#xD;
      in order to evaluate the relationship between RMMA and thyroid disease and genetical tests.&#xD;
      At the same time the relationship between bruxism, psycho-emotional state and sleep quality&#xD;
      will be evaluated through questionnaires PSS10, OBC and PSQI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Masticatory muscle activity during the study will be assessed on the basis of the record&#xD;
      coming from electromyography electrodes placed on the beard and symmetrically around the&#xD;
      masseter muscle attachments. The results will then be analyzed for the incidence RMMA&#xD;
      directly related to episodes of bruxism and their relation to episodes of sleep apnea,&#xD;
      changes in blood pressure and heart rate to determine the prevalence of cause-effect&#xD;
      relationships.&#xD;
