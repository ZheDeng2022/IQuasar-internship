  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of various doses and durations of linezolid&#xD;
      plus bedaquiline and pretomanid after 26 weeks of treatment in participants with either&#xD;
      pulmonary XDR-TB, pre-XDR-TB, or treatment intolerant or non-responsive MDR-TB.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A phase 3, multi-center, partially-blinded, randomized clinical trial in four parallel&#xD;
      treatment groups. Bedaquiline and pretomanid treatment will not be blinded. Linezolid&#xD;
      treatment dose and duration will be double-blinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a screening period of up to 14 days and will be randomized to receive&#xD;
      one of the 4 active treatment arms. Participants will be randomized to one of the four&#xD;
      regimens in a 1:1:1:1 ratio, using an interactive voice and web response system (IXRS) which&#xD;
      will utilize a randomization system using stratification with a random element to allocate&#xD;
      participants evenly across the arms by HIV status and type of TB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will receive 26 weeks of treatment. If participant's week 16 sputum sample&#xD;
      is culture positive between the week 16 and week 26 treatment visits and their clinical&#xD;
      condition suggests they may have an ongoing TB infection, Investigator may consider extending&#xD;
      current treatment to 39 weeks. If the culture results between week 16 and week 26 are&#xD;
      contaminated, missing or considered an isolated positive without clinical significance,&#xD;
      available culture results should be used to make this decision. All decisions regarding&#xD;
      treatment extension should be discussed with and approved by, in consultation with the&#xD;
      Sponsor Medical Monitor before implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be followed for 78 weeks after end of treatment.&#xD;
