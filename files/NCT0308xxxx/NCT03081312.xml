  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research will determine (a) the unmet needs of family caregivers of adult cancer&#xD;
      patients and (b) determine the impact on stress, care burden and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cross-sectional questionnaire methodology will be used to answer the research questions.&#xD;
      510 family caregivers at different stages of patients' cancer journey will be recruited. The&#xD;
      study duration is expected to take two years. Research findings will address the knowledge&#xD;
      gap of caregivers' needs and stress, burden and quality of life and support plans to help&#xD;
      caregivers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The literature suggests that caregivers have unique psychological, emotional and lifestyle&#xD;
      needs but there is a paucity of such information of caregivers in Singapore. As this study is&#xD;
      exploratory, no a priori hylothesis has been made. The theoretical framework guiding this&#xD;
      research is Fulfillment Theory in which the existence and perception of needs and need&#xD;
      fulfillment are hypothesized to be antecedents to the experience of satisfaction about care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cross-sectional questionnaire methodology will be used to answer the research questions.&#xD;
      Caregivers in this study are defined as: a family member who lends physical, emotional or&#xD;
      other support to someone at any time during the cancer journey. A power calculation was not&#xD;
      done, instead the sample size of 510 was based on what may be practically achievable and&#xD;
      feasible for the duration of the short-term quantitative study. Descriptive statistics will&#xD;
      be used to characterize the distribution of socio-demographic characteristics and&#xD;
      caregiver-related information. Regression analysis will be used to evaluate difference in&#xD;
      overall and domain specific needs across selected characteristics. Problems identified by&#xD;
      caregivers will be dichotomized as present or absent and chi-square tests will be used to&#xD;
      evaluate associations with selected characteristics.&#xD;
