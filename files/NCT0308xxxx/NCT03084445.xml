      Objectives and hypothesis The scale and diversity of chemicals in worldwide use today is&#xD;
      vast. Many of these chemicals are released into the environment where they are found in air,&#xD;
      water, soil, house dust, and in the food supply, resulting in exposure to humans.&#xD;
      Characterizing the extent of exposure and the effects of exposure in vulnerable populations,&#xD;
      such as pregnant women and children, is of the utmost importance as the chemical structure of&#xD;
      many of these compounds resembles hormones such as estrogen, testosterone and thyroid&#xD;
      hormone, affect neurodevelopment and other health effects. Here, we focus on few classes of&#xD;
      compounds: heavy metals, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), brominated flame retardants&#xD;
      (PBDEs) and phthalates. We will characterize the extent of exposure to pregnant women and&#xD;
      their infants in Israel, where biomonitoring studies in the general population are scarce. We&#xD;
      will also examine selected outcomes in pregnant women and their offspring in relation to&#xD;
      these compounds, and to establish a biorepository for further studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess Heavy metals, VOCs, PBDEs and phthalates body burdens through measurement of&#xD;
           these chemicals in maternal and paternal serum and urine, cord blood, breastmilk and&#xD;
           neonatal meconium among several representative sub-populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To examine associations between exposure to heavy metals, VOCs, PBDEs and phthalates and&#xD;
           (a) pregnancy complications, (b) anthropometrics at birth (i.e. birth weight adjusted&#xD;
           for gestational age, ponderal index, head circumference adjusted for gestational age),&#xD;
           and (c) cryptorchidism incidence, (d) maternal and infant thyroid function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To establish a bio repository of these media for future studies and to establish follow&#xD;
           up methods for this cohort to later assess development and growth in the infants,&#xD;
           toddlers and children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited from three delivery rooms in Israel: &quot;Assaf Harofeh Medical&#xD;
      Center&quot; , &quot;Lis (Sorasky) Medical Center&quot; and &quot;Rambam Medical Center&quot;, all together with&#xD;
      around 21,000 births annually, representing all sub-populations in Israel. 500&#xD;
      mother-father-infant trios (for a total of 4500) will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When arriving to the delivery room, after signing the informed consent, blood and urine will&#xD;
      be withdrawn from the mothers and fathers for Heavy metals, VOCs, PBDEs and phthalates&#xD;
      levels. At the same time thyroid function tests will also be taken from the mothers. After&#xD;
      delivery, cord blood will be taken, as well as meconium from the neonate. Hair, nails and&#xD;
      Breastmilk will also be collected. From the mothers The samples will be analyzed for heavy&#xD;
      metals, VOCs, PBDEs and phthalates. During their stay at the hospital, mothers and fathers&#xD;
      will fill out a standardized questionnaire regarding life style factors, background&#xD;
      information, and exposure opportunities. Detailed information on family history, previous and&#xD;
      present pregnancy, method of delivery, perinatal complications, and pregnancy outcome will be&#xD;
      recorded from the medical files.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected contribution to environmental health in Israel:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be the first data on sub-populations exposure to Heavy metals, VOCs, PBDEs and&#xD;
      phthalates in Israel. Neonatal meconium levels will provide important information on&#xD;
      magnitude of exposure during the last months of pregnancy, and, thus, will provide insights&#xD;
      into the bioaccumulative nature of these Heavy metals, VOCs, PBDEs and phthalates during&#xD;
      early stages of human development, important data for future risk assessments. Our&#xD;
      comprehensive approach will provide detailed information on the status of each subject. Such&#xD;
      novel knowledge would also lead to the development of preventive and counseling strategies&#xD;
      for men and women with high BFR and phthalates exposure in order to minimize the risks of&#xD;
      adverse outcomes. Knowledge transfer strategies are essential in order that the general&#xD;
      public, health professionals, scientists and policy/law regulators have the appropriate&#xD;
      knowledge on which to base their understandings and recommendations for the future. In this&#xD;
      way, the knowledge that is generated will facilitate the development of prevention strategies&#xD;
      to minimize health risks of Israel population.&#xD;

      Objectives and hypothesis The scale and diversity of chemicals in worldwide use today is&#xD;
      vast, ranging from pharmaceuticals and food products, to plastics, gasoline, and&#xD;
      semiconductor chips. Many of these chemicals are released into the environment where they are&#xD;
      found in air, water, soil, in house dust, and in the food supply, resulting in exposure to&#xD;
      humans. Characterizing the extent of exposure and the effects of exposure in vulnerable&#xD;
      populations, such as pregnant women and children, is of the utmost importance as the chemical&#xD;
      structure of many of these compounds resemble hormones such as estrogen, testosterone and&#xD;
      thyroid hormone , affect neurodevelopment and other health effects. Here, we focus on few&#xD;
      classes of compounds: heavy metals, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), brominated flame&#xD;
      retardants (PBDEs) and phthalates., and will characterize the extent of exposure to pregnant&#xD;
      women and their infants in Israel, where biomonitoring studies in the general population are&#xD;
      scarce. We also propose to examine selected outcomes in pregnant women and their offspring in&#xD;
      relation to these compounds, and to establish a biorepository for further studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BTEX (Benzene, Toluene, Ethylbenzene, Xylene):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are compounds with low boiling points; VOC exposures&#xD;
      originate from numerous natural and anthropogenic sources such as cleaning products, paints,&#xD;
      solvents, personal care products, automotive exhaust, and tobacco smoke. Exposure to certain&#xD;
      VOCs may increase the risk for birth defects, neurocognitive impairment, asthma, and cancer.&#xD;
      The known VOC metabolites are acrolein, acrylamide, acrylonitrile, benzene, 1-bromopropane,&#xD;
      1,3-butadiene, carbon disulfide, crotonaldehyde, cyanide, N,N-dimethylformamide,&#xD;
      ethylbenzene, ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, styrene, tetrachloroethylene, toluene,&#xD;
      trichloroethylene, vinyl chloride, and xylene exposures. Benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and&#xD;
      xylene isomers (BTEX), aromatic hydrocarbons, are part of VOC metabolites that play a major&#xD;
      role in industries and air pollution 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prena¬tal exposure to air pollution (contains BTEX) might be associated with adverse&#xD;
      pregnancy outcomes, including intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), low birth weight (LBW),&#xD;
      preterm birth (PTB), and intrauter¬ine mortality. Exposure to BTEX chemicals has been&#xD;
      associated with negative impacts on sperm quantity and quality. Benzene and toluene exposure&#xD;
      have been associated with abnormal menstrual cycle. Direct adverse effects of BTEX chemicals&#xD;
      have been observed on ovarian cell apoptosis, proliferation, and hormone release in animal&#xD;
      ovarian cells. Exposures to benzene and toluene, commonly used and produced by unconventional&#xD;
      oil and gas (UOG) operations, have been associated with increased risks for miscarriage 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Xylene is an environmental pollutant. It is also used in dyes, paints, polishes, medical&#xD;
      technology and different industries as a solvent. Human life is surrounded by a wide range of&#xD;
      VOCs, including xylene causing harmful health effects xylene exposure occurs through breath,&#xD;
      eye, oral, and dermal route. Xylene is mainly metabolized in the liver via oxidation of&#xD;
      methyl groups, followed by conjugation with glycine to yield hippuric acid, which is excreted&#xD;
      through urine. High amount and dose of xylene may harm the liver. Prolonged exposure to&#xD;
      xylene may cause a multiorgan damages such as: toxicity to nervous, reproductive, immune,&#xD;
      hepatic and respiratory systems. Furthermore, xylene reduces reproductive hormones in women&#xD;
      and cause male infertility. Studies have reported the subsequent effects in experimental&#xD;
      animals: deformities in fetus skeletal, increased interruption in bone formation, redness and&#xD;
      blood in fetus organs, and reduced fetus weight3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benzene is known as one of the predominant air pollutants in the environment. Chronic&#xD;
      exposure to benzene is known to cause oxidative stress, DNA damage, aplastic anemia and&#xD;
      increased risk of acute myelogenous leukemia in humans. The mechanism is through crucial&#xD;
      toxic metabolism, reactive metabolites and probably epigenetic changes. Common exposures to&#xD;
      benzene are tobacco smoke, automobile service stations, exhaust from motor vehicles, and&#xD;
      industrial emissions. Chromosomal abnormalities in sperm have also been reported with benzene&#xD;
      exposure4 [4],&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethylbenzene originates from tobacco smoke, burning fossil fuels, industries using&#xD;
      ethylbenzene, carpet glues, varnishes and paints. The hazards of ethylbenzene include acute&#xD;
      toxicity, mutagenicity, systemic toxicity, developmental and reproductive toxicity,&#xD;
      immunotoxicity, metabolism and pharmacokinetics, carcinogenicity, neurotoxicity, and&#xD;
      developmental neurotoxicity. At doses that produced maternal effects (&gt; 1000 ppm) in animals,&#xD;
      ethylbenzene was fetotoxic causing decreased fetal body weight (bwt) and increased skeletal&#xD;
      variations5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exposure to toluene is from, industrial paints and paint thinner, tobacco smoke, and fossil&#xD;
      fuels6. Toluene has intoxicating and rewarding effects in the brain. Acute exposure to&#xD;
      inhalants has dose dependent, reversible effects like depressed central nervous system (CNS).&#xD;
      High concentrations can cause sedation and anesthesia, while higher concentration can result&#xD;
      in coma or death by respiratory depression. At delivery, toluene-exposed infants were&#xD;
      characteristically premature and/or delayed in growth as. Additionally, as the children grow,&#xD;
      a number of developmental delays and impairments become evident (e.g., language impairments,&#xD;
      growth retardation, hyperactivity, cerebellar dysfunction)7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trichloroethylene (TCE) and perchloroethylene (PCE) are part of the VOCs and the air&#xD;
      pollution. It is known that the risk of epilepsy and certain types of cancer such as cervical&#xD;
      cancer may be increased among adults who were exposed to PCE-contaminated drinking water.&#xD;
      Exposure during gestation and early childhood and exposure to a major metabolite of TCE, TCAA&#xD;
      (trichloroacetic acid)administered in drinking water, resulted in increased numbers of&#xD;
      implantation and resorption sites, and selective cardiac teratogenicity8,9.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heavy metal elements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metal intake can be via air, water and food. Air pollution exposure includes inhalation or&#xD;
      ingestion of ultrafine particulate matter, also called nanoparticles. Epidemiological studies&#xD;
      have consistently found an association between small increases in urban particulates and&#xD;
      health effects, including increased morbidity and mortality in people with respiratory and&#xD;
      cardiac disease. All metals in excess can cause disease. Long term exposure to metal is a&#xD;
      cause of increased metal accumulation in a variety of body tissue. Some metals are more toxic&#xD;
      than others10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalent elements that found in soil in Haifa bay:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nickel (Ni) - Nickel sensitivities are the most common harmful health effect in humans.&#xD;
           People working in nickel refineries or nickel-processing plants are more affected with&#xD;
           chronic bronchitis, asthma and reduced lung function then the general population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lead (Pb) - neurological ailments and learning impairments can inactive enzymes, thus&#xD;
           affecting red blood cell production, amino acid function and number of biochemical&#xD;
           systems in the body. Lead exposure is associated with an increased risk of miscarriage&#xD;
           and stillbirth potentially due to placental rupture.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chromium (Cr) - is found in all phases of the environment including air, water, and&#xD;
           soil, and its many chemical forms are pollutants with serious implication to the&#xD;
           environment and human health. Hexavalent chromium (Cr6) occurs in the environment from&#xD;
           the erosion of natural chromium deposits, but is also a product of industrial processes.&#xD;
           There are demonstrated instances of Cr6 being released into the environment by leakage,&#xD;
           poor storage, or inadequate industrial waste disposal practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mercury (Hg) - affects central nervous function. A source of it is an exposure to&#xD;
           breathing air from spills, incinerators and industries burning mercury containing fuels.&#xD;
           Mercury, at high levels, may damage the brain, kidneys, and the developing fetus.&#xD;
           Short-term exposure to high levels of metallic mercury vapors may cause lung damage,&#xD;
           nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, increases in blood pressure or heart rate, skin rashes, and&#xD;
           eye irritation11.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cadmium- elevated cadmium exposure during pregnancy may be inversely associated with&#xD;
           children's cognitive function measured at pre-school age. Exposure to cadmium has been&#xD;
           shown to result in miscarriage and stillbirths in exposed mothers, potentially through&#xD;
           decreased levels of antioxidants or enhanced lipid peroxidation resulting in oxidative&#xD;
           stress12.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mangenase (Mn) - is used in steel production to improve hardness, stiffness, and&#xD;
           strength. It may be used as an additive in gasoline to improve the octane rating of the&#xD;
           gas. Exposure to high level of manganese in air can cause lung irritation and&#xD;
           reproductive effects.13 The central nervous system is a common target organ for many&#xD;
           environmental metals. The adverse effects of heavy metal exposure in the prenatal and&#xD;
           early childhood periods are of increasing concern in terms of high exposure on a body&#xD;
           weight basis, immature metabolic pathways, delicate developmental processes, and life&#xD;
           course effects. Prenatal exposure to lead and mercury has been related to congenital&#xD;
           anomalies and impaired neurodevelopment. Metals may interact to cause synergistic or&#xD;
           antagonistic effects on neurodevelopment that are different from the main effects of&#xD;
           exposure to each metal alone. Metals exposure during prenatal and childhood may affect&#xD;
           the neurodevelopment/cognitive and behavior14.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If more risk factors such as genetic, ethnic and environmental exposure coincide, disease&#xD;
      development is more likely to progress. Exposure to heavy metals during pregnancy is&#xD;
      associated with increased risks of miscarriage and/or stillbirths.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heavy metals may be routinely mobilized during hydraulic fracturing operations and have been&#xD;
      shown to contaminate surface and ground water in some cases (e.g., lead), they are also&#xD;
      inadvertent contaminants in fracturing fluids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brominated Flame Retardants Brominated Flame Retardants (BFRs) constitute a group of chemical&#xD;
      substances that are used worldwide to reduce fire-related injury and property damage. They&#xD;
      are found in polymers (polystyrene foams, high impact polystyrene, epoxy resins) that are&#xD;
      incorporated into a wide variety of consumer products (textiles, foam furniture, insulating&#xD;
      foams, electrical equipment, kitchen appliances, televisions and computers). In 2000, it was&#xD;
      estimated that &gt;200,000 metric tons of BFRs were produced annually. There are currently five&#xD;
      major BFRs: three commercial mixtures of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (penta-, octa- and&#xD;
      deca-BDEs), hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) and tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) routinely present&#xD;
      in a broad variety of consumer goods. Because BFRs leach out of manufactured products and&#xD;
      these products are dumped in the environment, we are exposed to BFRs from a wide variety of&#xD;
      sources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The concentration of BFRs in the environment, has increased dramatically over the past two&#xD;
      decades while, thanks to international regulatory policies, that of other known toxicants&#xD;
      (DDT, lead, PCBs) has declined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exposure through contaminated food, particularly meat and dairy products, is believed to be&#xD;
      the major contributor to BFR exposure in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are reports that newborns and young infants have higher serum concentrations than older&#xD;
      children and adults, since it is generally believed that infants are more vulnerable to&#xD;
      toxicological insults. Scientists in the USA have reported that the median levels of BDEs in&#xD;
      human breast milk increased almost 10-fold from the 90's to the early 2000's. The in-utero&#xD;
      period is a critical period for exposure; however, there is a scarcity of information with&#xD;
      respect to BFR exposure during the earliest stages of human development. A study monitoring&#xD;
      tetra- to octa-BDE levels in early to mid-gestation human fetal liver and placenta from&#xD;
      1998-2006, demonstrated not only that these toxicants cross the placenta from as early as&#xD;
      nine weeks fetal age but also that the 2006 fetal tissue levels are &gt;5-fold higher than they&#xD;
      were nine years previously. Thus, fetal BFR exposure is also on the rise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the BFR burden in humans is increasing and exposures occur from an early stage in&#xD;
      development, the consequences are relatively unexplored. Three clinical studies have been&#xD;
      published to date on the potential effects of in-utero BFR exposure and fetal outcome.&#xD;
      Elevated levels of BFRs in breast milk correlated significantly with lower newborn birth&#xD;
      weight, birth length, head size, chest circumference and body mass index. Significant&#xD;
      associations between maternal serum BFR levels at 35 weeks gestation and the levels of&#xD;
      several sex hormones (testosterone, estradiol, LH, SHBG) in 3 month old female and male&#xD;
      offspring were reported. In addition, Main and colleagues have found significantly higher BFR&#xD;
      levels in the breast milk of mothers whose newborn sons had cryptorchidism. If left&#xD;
      untreated, cryptorchidism can lead to serious reproduction-related problems: low sperm counts&#xD;
      and infertility as well as a 2- to 8-fold increase in the risk of testicular cancer. These&#xD;
      data suggest that BFRs are impacting early stages of human development and that at least one&#xD;
      outcome is abnormal reproductive systems. This is a serious issue: not only is an&#xD;
      individual's health potentially affected but so is that of future generations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phthalates Phthalates are a class of high production volume chemicals used in a wide variety&#xD;
      of consumer products. They are commonly used as plasticizers to increase flexibility and&#xD;
      durability. They are also used to hold fragrances, and as propellants. Global production of&#xD;
      phthalates has increased dramatically since World War II and is currently estimated to exceed&#xD;
      3.5 million metric tons/year. DEHP constitutes roughly 50% of the market share, but uses of&#xD;
      DBP and BBzP are also large (&gt; 100,000 metric tons/year each). The widespread use has&#xD;
      resulted in ubiquitous contamination, including of the indoor environment, with exposures&#xD;
      higher in industrialized than in developing nations. Table 1 below shows sources of exposure&#xD;
      of the phthalate diesters that will be evaluated in the proposed study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some recent studies, find prenatal exposure to phthalates to be associated with reductions in&#xD;
      fetal growth, shorter pregnancy duration, perturbed thyroid function, and both cognitive and&#xD;
      behavioral deficits in children. More data are clearly required to fully characterize the&#xD;
      health effects in vulnerable populations of pregnant women and children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess Heavy metals, VOCs, PBDEs and phthalates body burdens through measurement of&#xD;
           these chemicals in maternal and paternal serum and urine, cord blood, breastmilk and&#xD;
           neonatal meconium among several representative sub-populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To examine associations between exposure to heavy metals, VOCs, PBDEs and phthalates and&#xD;
           (a) pregnancy complications, (b) anthropometrics at birth (i.e. birth weight adjusted&#xD;
           for gestational age, ponderal index, head circumference adjusted for gestational age),&#xD;
           and (c) cryptorchidism incidence, (d) maternal and infant thyroid function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To establish a bio repository of these media for future studies and to establish follow&#xD;
           up methods for this cohort to later assess development and growth in the infants,&#xD;
           toddlers and children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited from three delivery rooms in Israel: &quot;Assaf Harofeh Medical&#xD;
      Center&quot; , &quot;Lis (Sorasky) Medical Center&quot; and &quot;Rambam Medical Center&quot;, all together with&#xD;
      around 21,000 births annually, representing all sub-populations in Israel. 500&#xD;
      mother-father-infant trios (for a total of 4500) will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When arriving to the delivery room, after signing the informed consent, blood and urine will&#xD;
      be withdrawn from the mothers and fathers for Heavy metals, VOCs, PBDEs and phthalates&#xD;
      levels. At the same time thyroid function tests will also be taken from the mothers. After&#xD;
      delivery, cord blood will be taken, as well as meconium from the neonate. Hair, nails and&#xD;
      Breastmilk will also be collected. From the mothers The samples will be analyzed for heavy&#xD;
      metals, VOCs, PBDEs and phthalates. During their stay at the hospital, mothers and fathers&#xD;
      will fill out a standardized questionnaire regarding life style factors, background&#xD;
      information, and exposure opportunities. Detailed information on family history, previous and&#xD;
      present pregnancy, method of delivery, perinatal complications, and pregnancy outcome will be&#xD;
      recorded from the medical files.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility of the research:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delivery, maternal and neonatal departments in all medical centers have a large number of&#xD;
      deliveries annually. The population admitted to these centers is representative of the&#xD;
      population in Israel. Since blood work is part of the admission to the delivery room, and&#xD;
      since the neonates will not have an invasive procedure (meconium), we expect many couples to&#xD;
      participate in this innovative study. Our comprehensive approach, using a combination of a&#xD;
      standardized questionnaire, maternal and paternal serum, cord blood, urine, breastmilk and&#xD;
      meconium analysis of the chemicals, will provide a detailed definition of the body burden&#xD;
      status of each subject. We have the means and the desire to facilitate knowledge exchange&#xD;
      between basic and clinical scientists, between those who generate knowledge and those who use&#xD;
      it in developing policies and regulations, as well as among scientists, health professionals&#xD;
      and the general public.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected contribution to environmental health in Israel:&#xD;
&#xD;
      These will be the first data on sub-populations exposure to Heavy metals, VOCs, PBDEs and&#xD;
      phthalatesin Israel. Neonatal meconium levels will provide important information on magnitude&#xD;
      of exposure during the last months of pregnancy, and, thus, will provide insights into the&#xD;
      bioaccumulative nature of these Heavy metals, VOCs, PBDEs and phthalatesduring early stages&#xD;
      of human development, important data for future risk assessments. Our comprehensive approach&#xD;
      will provide detailed information on the status of each subject. Such novel knowledge would&#xD;
      also lead to the development of preventive and counseling strategies for men and women with&#xD;
      high BFR and phthalate exposure in order to minimize the risks of adverse outcomes. Knowledge&#xD;
      transfer strategies are essential in order that the general public, health professionals,&#xD;
      scientists and policy/law regulators have the appropriate knowledge on which to base their&#xD;
      understandings and recommendations for the future. In this way, the knowledge that is&#xD;
      generated will facilitate the development of prevention strategies to minimize health risks&#xD;
      of Israel population.&#xD;
