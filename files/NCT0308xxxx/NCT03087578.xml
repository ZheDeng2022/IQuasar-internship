      This study compares electroacupuncture to mirabegron for treatment of overactive bladder&#xD;
      (OAB) symptoms in women who have failed treatment with anticholingeric therapy.&#xD;

      Screening/Eligibility Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If it is determined that a patient with a diagnosis of OAB has failed therapy with at least&#xD;
      one anti-cholinergic agent, the potential participant will be screened and eligibility will&#xD;
      be confirmed by a study investigator. A signed, IRB-approved informed consent will be&#xD;
      obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be performed after the patient has agreed to participate and discussed and&#xD;
      signed the informed consent form. Patients will be randomized in random blocks of 4, 6 and 8&#xD;
      into either the acupuncture group or mirabegron group. Once patient participation is&#xD;
      confirmed, an enveloped marked with the study participant number will be opened by one of the&#xD;
      study investigators in front of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acupuncture Protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All acupuncture sessions will be performed by a licensed acupuncturist employed by University&#xD;
      Hospitals Connor Integrative Health Network. All acupuncturists involved in the study&#xD;
      protocol will be trained and supervised in the correct technique by Christine Kaiser, MS,&#xD;
      LAc, Dipl.OM. Acupuncture session will be performed weekly for 6 weeks and will be scheduled&#xD;
      to accommodate both the patient's and acupuncturists' schedules. Acupuncture sessions will&#xD;
      last for 30 minutes. Selected points will include kidney 3, kidney 6, spleen 6, and ren 4.&#xD;
      The current delivery with electroacupuncture is approximately 10-20 mA (adjusted to patient&#xD;
      sensation) delivery at 10 Hz for 30 minutes per session. After completion of 6 weeks of&#xD;
      treatments patients will be contacted by phone at 2 week intervals to determine duration of&#xD;
      symptomatic relief after cessation of treatment..&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mirabegron Protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients assigned to the medication group will be prescribed 50 mg of myrbetriq daily to take&#xD;
      for 6 weeks. At the completion of the study, if patients are satisfied with the effect of&#xD;
      mirabegron they may continue to use it at their discretion.&#xD;
