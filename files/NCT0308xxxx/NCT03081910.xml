  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients eligible for this study have a type of blood cancer called T-cell leukemia or&#xD;
      lymphoma (lymph gland cancer).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The body has different ways of fighting infection and disease. No one way seems perfect for&#xD;
      fighting cancers. This research study combines two different ways of fighting disease,&#xD;
      antibodies and T cells, hoping that they will work together. Antibodies are types of proteins&#xD;
      that protect the body from bacterial and other diseases. T cells, also called T lymphocytes,&#xD;
      are special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill other cells including tumor cells.&#xD;
      Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with cancers; they have shown&#xD;
      promise, but have not been strong enough to cure most patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      T lymphocytes can kill tumor cells but there normally are not enough of them to kill all the&#xD;
      tumor cells. Some researchers have taken T cells from a person's blood, grown more of them in&#xD;
      the laboratory and then given them back to the person. In some patients who have recently had&#xD;
      a bone marrow or stem cell transplant, the number of T cells in their blood may not be enough&#xD;
      to grow in the laboratory. In this situation, T cells may be collected from their previous&#xD;
      transplant donor, who has a similar tissue type.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The antibody used in this study is called anti-CD5. It first came from mice that have&#xD;
      developed immunity to human leukemia. This antibody sticks to T-cell leukemia or lymphoma&#xD;
      cells because of a substance on the outside of these cells called CD5. CD5 antibodies have&#xD;
      been used to treat people with T-cell leukemia and lymphoma. For this study, anti-CD5 has&#xD;
      been changed so that instead of floating free in the blood it is now joined to the T cells.&#xD;
      When an antibody is joined to a T cell in this way it is called a chimeric receptor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the laboratory, the investigators have also found that T cells work better if proteins&#xD;
      that stimulate T cells are also added, such as one called CD28. Adding the CD28 makes the&#xD;
      cells grow better and last longer in the body, thus giving the cells a better chance of&#xD;
      killing the leukemia or lymphoma cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study investigators are going to attach the CD5 chimeric receptor with CD28 added to&#xD;
      it to the patient's T cells or the previous bone marrow transplant donor's T cells. The&#xD;
      investigators will then test how long the cells last. The decision to use the bone marrow&#xD;
      transplant donor's T cells instead of the patient's will be based on 1) whether there is an&#xD;
      available and willing donor and 2) the likelihood of the patient's T cells being able to grow&#xD;
      in the lab. These CD5 chimeric receptor T cells with CD28 are investigational products not&#xD;
      approved by the Food and Drug Administration.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To make the T cells the investigators will take blood from the patient or from the previous&#xD;
      bone marrow transplant donor and stimulate it with growth factors to make the T cells grow.&#xD;
      To get the CD5 antibody and CD28 to attach to the surface of the T cell, investigators insert&#xD;
      the antibody gene into the T cell. This is done with a virus called a retrovirus that has&#xD;
      been made for this study and will carry the antibody gene into the T cell. This virus also&#xD;
      helps investigators find the T cells in the patient's blood after they are injected. Because&#xD;
      the patient will have received cells with a new gene in them the patient will be followed for&#xD;
      a total of 15 years to see if there are any long term side effects of gene transfer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the patient is enrolled on this study, they will be assigned a dose of CD5 chimeric&#xD;
      receptor-T cells Several studies suggest that the infused T cells need room to be able to&#xD;
      proliferate (grow) and accomplish their functions and that this may not happen if there are&#xD;
      too many other T cells in circulation. Because of that, the patient will receive two&#xD;
      chemotherapy medications prior to receiving the CD5 chimeric receptor-T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One medication is called cyclophosphamide and the other fludarabine. The patient will receive&#xD;
      3 daily doses of each drug, ending at least one day before the patient receives the chimeric&#xD;
      receptor-T cells. These drugs will decrease the numbers of the patient's own T cells before&#xD;
      the CD5 chimeric receptor T cells are infused and also will help decrease the number of other&#xD;
      cells that may interfere with the chimeric receptor-T cells working well. Although we do not&#xD;
      expect any effect on the patient's tumor with the doses that the patient will receive, these&#xD;
      drugs are part of many regimens that are used to treat leukemia or lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be given an injection of cells into the vein through an IV at the assigned&#xD;
      dose. The injection will take from 1 to 10 minutes. Before the patient receives the&#xD;
      injection, they may be given a dose of Benadryl and Tylenol. The treatment will be given by&#xD;
      the Center for Cell and Gene Therapy at Texas Children's Hospital or Houston Methodist&#xD;
      Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be followed in the clinic after the injection for up to 3 hours, and the&#xD;
      patient will have to remain locally for at least 3 weeks after the infusion. If the patient&#xD;
      experiences any side effects, they may have to be hospitalized for evaluation and management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If after a 4-6 week evaluation period after the infusion, the patient has achieved a complete&#xD;
      response (measured by bone marrow or radiology scans), the patient's primary oncology doctors&#xD;
      may decide the patient should proceed to bone marrow transplant, at which time the patient&#xD;
      will be removed from the treatment portion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before being treated, the patient will receive a series of standard medical tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam and History; Blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver function;&#xD;
      Pregnancy test for female patients who are of child bearing potential; Measurements of the&#xD;
      patient's tumor by scans and/or bone marrow studies&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will also receive standard medical tests during treatment and after:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exams and History; Blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver function;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Graft versus Host Disease assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements of the patient's tumor by scans and/or bone marrow studies 6-8 weeks after the&#xD;
      infusion and then per standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn more about the way the CD5 chimeric receptor-T cells are working and how long they&#xD;
      last in the body, extra blood will be drawn. The total amount on any day is about 10&#xD;
      teaspoons (50 mL) or no more than 3 mL per 2.2 pounds body weight in children. This volume is&#xD;
      considered safe but may be decreased if the patient is anemic. This blood may be drawn from a&#xD;
      central line if the patient has one. Blood will be taken before the chemotherapy drugs,&#xD;
      several hours after the T cell infusion, at 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks (optional), 4 weeks, 6&#xD;
      weeks and 8 weeks (optional) after the infusion, at 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, at 1 year,&#xD;
      every 6 months for 4 years, then yearly for a total of 15 years. We will also test blood to&#xD;
      check for signs of viral infection at the following time points: within 1 to 2 weeks prior to&#xD;
      chemotherapy drugs, prior to T cell infusion, then at weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 for all&#xD;
      patients, and months 3, 6, 9, 12 for patients who do not proceed to bone marrow transplant.&#xD;
      The total blood drawn during participation in this study will not exceed 280 teaspoons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the dose escalation portion of the study is completed, we will expand the trial and&#xD;
      treat up to an additional 6 patients (2 cohorts) at the MTD in each group to gather&#xD;
      additional safety data and preliminary efficacy data.&#xD;
