      This research study is studying immunotherapy in combination with radiation therapy as a&#xD;
      possible treatment for head &amp; neck cancer that has worsened or spread to another organ or&#xD;
      part of your body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The immunotherapy involved in this study is: MK-3475 (pembrolizumab or KEYTRUDA).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an investigational treatment to learn whether the treatment works in&#xD;
      treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the treatment is being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MK-3475 is a humanized monoclonal antibody. An antibody is a common type of protein made in&#xD;
      the body in response to a foreign substance (particles not typically found in the body such&#xD;
      as bacteria or viruses). Antibodies attack foreign substances and protect against infection.&#xD;
      Antibodies can also be produced in the laboratory for use in treating patients. MK-3475 is&#xD;
      designed to restore the natural ability of the immune system to recognize and target cancer&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA recently granted approval to MK-3475 as a treatment for patients with recurrent or&#xD;
      metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). This study is testing whether using&#xD;
      radiation in combination with MK-3475 will make this drug work better in participants that&#xD;
      might otherwise be unlikely to benefit from this drug because they have not responded to&#xD;
      either this same drug given without radiation or another similar drug.&#xD;

             pathologic or cytologic evidence of metastatic disease should have unequivocal&#xD;
             evidence of metastasis from physical examination or radiologic evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have evidence of radiologic or clinical disease progression during&#xD;
             previous treatment with systemic PD-1 directed therapy, or have stable disease on&#xD;
             prior PD-1 therapy (at least 6 doses) and/or have been deemed not to derive clinical&#xD;
             benefit from PD-1 directed treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have least 3 measurable non-CNS based lesions that have not previously&#xD;
             been irradiated. Palliative radiation must be potentially indicated for at least one&#xD;
             of these lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must agree to undergo a research biopsy, if tumor is accessible, at baseline&#xD;

             recovery of toxicity. For investigational agents, the minimum time from prior therapy&#xD;
             is 5 half-lives if this is longer than 2 weeks in duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior radiation therapy: Patients must be at least 2 weeks from prior radiation&#xD;
             therapy&#xD;
&#xD;

             currently unavailable on the use immune checkpoint blockade for participants &lt; 18&#xD;
             years of age, and thus children are excluded from this study.&#xD;

             entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Metastatic disease impinging on the spinal cord or threatening spinal cord&#xD;
             compression.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Surgical fixation of bone lesion to be irradiated is required and indicated to provide&#xD;
             mechanical stability.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known brain metastases that are untreated, symptomatic, or require therapy to control&#xD;
             symptoms. Participants with previously diagnosed brain metastases are eligible if they&#xD;
             have completed treatment at least 2 weeks prior to trial therapy initiation, are&#xD;
             neurologically stable, and have recovered from the acute effects of radiotherapy or&#xD;
             surgery. Any corticosteroid use for brain metastases must have been discontinued&#xD;
             without the subsequent appearance of symptoms for ≥2 weeks before the initiating&#xD;
             protocol therapy. Treatment for brain metastases may include surgery, whole brain&#xD;
             radiotherapy, radiosurgery, or a combination as deemed appropriate by the treating&#xD;
             physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to pembrolizumab or previous toxicity attributed to pembrolizumab or other&#xD;
             PD-1 directed therapy that led to drug discontinuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including but not limited to ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormality, including a marked&#xD;
             Baseline prolonged QT/QTc ([QT interval/corrected QT interval], e.g., a repeated&#xD;
             demonstration of a QTc interval &gt;500 ms).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because immunotherapy has the potential&#xD;
             for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential&#xD;
             risk of adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with&#xD;
             immunotherapy, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated on this&#xD;
             protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals with a history of a different malignancy are ineligible except for the&#xD;
             following circumstances: if they have been disease-free for at least 2 years and are&#xD;
             deemed by the investigator to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy; or if&#xD;
             diagnosed and treated for cervical cancer in situ or basal cell or squamous cell&#xD;
             carcinoma of the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive individuals on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because&#xD;
             of the potential for interaction between immunotherapy and these medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids, evidence of&#xD;
             interstitial lung disease or active, non infectious pneumonitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active, suspected or prior documented autoimmune disease that has required systemic&#xD;
             treatment in the last 2 years with immune modifying agents (e.g. replacement therapy&#xD;
             such as thyroxine, insulin or physiologic corticosteroids is not an exclusion&#xD;
             criteria).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is known to be positive for HepBsAg, or HCV RNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Lack of availability for follow up assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The investigator's belief that the subject is medically unfit to receive pembrolizumab&#xD;
             and or unsuitable for any other reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy&#xD;
