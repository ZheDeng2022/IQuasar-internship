      The application of transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE) using LifePearl Microspheres loaded&#xD;
      with Irinotecan in liver-only or liver-dominant metastatic disease in patients with&#xD;
      colorectal adenocarcinoma will be observed. The registry has the following objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. map the exact indications that the device is being used for and at which stage in&#xD;
           treatment it is being applied&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to assess observed treatment outcomes in terms of safety and effectiveness as well as&#xD;
           trying to determine any predictive response factors&#xD;

      CIREL will capture a broad spectrum of real clinical data on the delivery of transcatheter&#xD;
      arterial chemoembolisation (TACE) using LifePearl Microspheres loaded with Irinotecan&#xD;
      (LP-IRI) and the observed clinical outcomes. The aim of doing so is to improve our&#xD;
      understanding of how LifePearl microspheres are administered as part of the standard&#xD;
      treatment of colorectal adenocarcinoma with liver metastases in Europe. Ultimately, the&#xD;
      collection of real-life data is intended to provide an evidence-base from which conclusions&#xD;
      can be drawn on how to optimise treatment protocols and consequently the therapy outcome of&#xD;
      TACE performed with LifePearl Microspheres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CIREL registry is a prospective multicentre observational (non-interventional) study. In&#xD;
      order to meet the objective of collecting real-life data, all subjects receiving TACE with&#xD;
      LifePearl Microspheres loaded with Irinotecan and fulfilling the inclusion criteria in all&#xD;
      participating centres will be asked to participate. Patients are only asked to participate in&#xD;
      the registry when they are treated with LifePearl Microspheres loaded with Irinotecan as part&#xD;
      of the treatment determined by the treating clinician. In no way, will participation in the&#xD;
      registry influence the way in which the patient is treated according to the treating&#xD;
      clinician, or will it influence the quality of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to measure changes in the quality of life of enrolled patients at different moments&#xD;
      in time before and after treatment with LifePearl microspheres, CIREL will incorporate the&#xD;
      EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire. The quality of life questionnaire is suggested to be offered to&#xD;
      the patient at the following three points in time:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Immediately (max. 1 week) before the treatment with LP-IRI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  4-8 weeks after completion of the full treatment with LP-IRI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  12-16 weeks after the completion of the full treatment with LP-IRI&#xD;
&#xD;
      Filling out the quality-of-life questionnaire is entirely voluntary for the patient. The&#xD;
      patient will be offered to fill out the questionnaire in his/her mother tongue. The patient&#xD;
      will have the choice to fill in the questionnaire either in hard copy or online via the&#xD;
      electronic data capture system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CIREL registry will include central image analysis performed by the Fédération&#xD;
      Francophone de Cancérologie Digestive (FFCD). The aim of the analyis is to detect possible&#xD;
      associations between RECIST (v1.1) criteria and observed outcomes, reduce bias by providing a&#xD;
      second reading and raise data quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The registry aims at enrolling up to 150 patients. The registry will stop enrolment two and a&#xD;
      half years after the enrolment of the first patient, unless decided differently by the&#xD;
      Steering Committee. Patients should be followed up until 65% of active patients are deceased&#xD;
      and for at least 12 months.&#xD;
