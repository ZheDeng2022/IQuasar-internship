  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and effectiveness of subjects&#xD;
      receiving MR-guided Focused Ultrasound (MRgFUS) treatment for painful bone metastases. This&#xD;
      study will evaluate treatment response and clinically significant adverse events. Other&#xD;
      relevant data may be documented as well.&#xD;

      This proposed study will be performed in full compliance with all applicable privacy rules&#xD;
      and regulations, and their implementations at participating site(s). All subjects planned to&#xD;
      undergo the MRgFUS procedure at Taipei Medical University Hospital will be offered informed&#xD;
      consent so they can be included in this Study.&#xD;
