    <textblock>
      Different subtypes of serrated lesions have been recently described. Among them, both sessile&#xD;
      serrated polyp/adenoma (SSP/A) and traditional serrated adenoma (TSA) could have malignant&#xD;
      potential through the serrated pathway or CIMP. These lesions, as a potential source of&#xD;
      interval cancer, should also be considered in colorectal cancer (CRC) population-based&#xD;
      screening programs. It is believed that this new described pathway could be responsible for&#xD;
      up to 30% of all CRC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unlike the traditional adenoma, serrated lesions are difficult to diagnose because of their&#xD;
      particular endoscopic appearance and their still unclear histological criteria. Furthermore,&#xD;
      they have specific molecular changes and, through them, they could evolve into CRC faster&#xD;
      than the adenoma. The real prevalence of the serrated lesions and their specific risk for&#xD;
      developing new synchronous/metachronous lesions, or even malignancy, remains unknown. For all&#xD;
      these reasons, we don't know if these patients could constitute a different CRC-risk group&#xD;
      and if specific recommendations are needed during their follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective longitudinal study developed within the framework of the CRC-screening&#xD;
      program in the Valencian Community (Spain). We expect to include a total of 700 individuals&#xD;
      who will be followed during 10 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our study, we will collect epidemiologic variables related to the patient, variables&#xD;
      related to all the polyps, and mutational (BRAF, KRAS, MSI), and CpG-island methylation&#xD;
      status of serrated lesions. Strict endoscopic and histological criteria will be applied for&#xD;
      the diagnosis of serrated lesions. All lesions detected at the index colonoscopy and during&#xD;
      follow-up will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to correlate epidemiologic data, histological characteristics&#xD;
      and the molecular profile of the serrated lesions with findings during follow-up, in order to&#xD;
      define stratified groups according to their risk of developing new lesions or CRC in the&#xD;
      future.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      BACKGROUND Colorectal cancer (CRC) is, by its frequency and consequences, a relevant public&#xD;
      health problem that has led to the implementation of population screening programs in many&#xD;
      countries. The purpose of these programs is to reduce the incidence and mortality of CRC by&#xD;
      early diagnosis of the disease, in the so-called pre-symptomatic phase. That is, to identify&#xD;
      and remove all precursor lesions, essentially colon adenomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there is increasing evidence that these programs are not fully effective in&#xD;
      preventing CRC. Cancers that appear before the next scheduled endoscopic control, called&#xD;
      interval cancer (IC), occur in up to 2.5 / 1000 patients / year of observation, and the&#xD;
      cumulative probability of developing a CRC within the first 5 years after an adenoma removal&#xD;
      could be up to 2%. Recent studies suggest that the cause of more than 50% of ICs is the&#xD;
      failure detecting premalignant lesions in the colon, either due to a poor colon preparation,&#xD;
      technical deficiencies in the performance of colonoscopy or the characteristics of the&#xD;
      lesions that make them barely visible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A possible origin of the ICs could be the serrated polyp (SP). This is actually not a single&#xD;
      lesion, but a heterogeneous group of lesions, different from the conventional adenoma, and&#xD;
      characterized by the serration of the crypts in the histology. Serrated lesions, especially&#xD;
      some subgroups, have macroscopic features that make them particularly difficult to detect in&#xD;
      conventional colonoscopy: indistinct borders, cloud-like appearance, often covered by a&#xD;
      mucous cap and interruption of the underlying mucosal vascular pattern. But the true&#xD;
      diagnosis of serrated lesions is made by morphological criteria with the microscopic&#xD;
      examination of the sample obtained by biopsy. Although all lesions that showed these features&#xD;
      were initially identified as hyperplastic polyps (HP), in the last decade three subtypes of&#xD;
      serrated lesions with different clinical implications have been described [HP, sessile&#xD;
      serrated polyp/adenoma (SSA/P) and traditional serrated adenoma (TSA)]. However, the&#xD;
      histological criteria are not yet fully clarified, and there is confusion in the terms to be&#xD;
      used. Therefore, the agreement among pathologists is generally poor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a consequence, many serrated lesions are misdiagnosed and incorrectly classified. This has&#xD;
      clinical relevance since some of them have malignant capacity. Both SSA/P and TSA can evolve&#xD;
      to CRC through the so-called serrated pathway or cytosine-phosphate-guanosine (CpG) island&#xD;
      methylator phenotype (CIMP), which could be responsible for up to 30% of all CRC. In this&#xD;
      pathway, an aberrant hypermethylation of the genome is produced, which leads to&#xD;
      transcriptional silencing and inhibition of expression in some genes promoter regions&#xD;
      (epigenetic modification). CRCs that arise from a SP are not homogeneous and may have&#xD;
      different molecular and histological characteristics depending on whether the origin mutation&#xD;
      in the precursor lesion occurs in BRAF or Kirsten rat sarcoma (KRAS) gene, which leads to the&#xD;
      development of SSA/P or TSA. And depending on if a mutL homolog 1 (MLH1) gene methylation is&#xD;
      produced thereafter, a unstable (MSI) or stable (MSS) CRC will develop. The presence of a&#xD;
      high CIMP rate also depends on the initial mutation. Therefore, serrated lesions could&#xD;
      originate MSI/CIMP-H CRC (11%), MSS/CIMP-H CCR (4%) and MSS/CIMP-L CRC (15%). It is thought&#xD;
      that some of the ICs may be directly related to the SP because they share morphological and&#xD;
      molecular characteristics. The evolution from SSP/SSA to invasive carcinoma has been&#xD;
      described to occur in only eight months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This theoretical risk of developing advanced premalignant lesions and IC and its clinical&#xD;
      significance has not been clearly shown in clinical practice because data on the prevalence&#xD;
      of serrated lesions are limited and there is also a lack of longitudinal follow-up studies in&#xD;
      patients with serrated lesions. The prevalence described is very variable and ranges from&#xD;
      0.6% to 13%, depending on the study, and the data are even scarcer in fecal occult blood test&#xD;
      (FOBT) -based screening population. The presence of serrated lesions (other than HP) has been&#xD;
      associated with the development of advanced synchronous adenomas in the colon, but also with&#xD;
      advanced metachronous lesions during follow-up. This situation could place these patients in&#xD;
      a special risk group. Patients with large SP may have a similar risk to develop a future CRC&#xD;
      to those patients with advanced adenomas. Most Scientific Societies recommend endoscopic&#xD;
      follow-up of serrated lesions, but the evidence is weak and specific intervals are proposed&#xD;
      based only on expert recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, there are still many unresolved questions about serrated polyps and their&#xD;
      importance in CRC screening programs. Their prevalence on CRC screening population is not&#xD;
      fully clarified because of the lack of prospective trials and the difficulty in diagnosis and&#xD;
      histological classification. Their malignant potential is not clarified either because of the&#xD;
      uncertainty about the prevalence of dysplasia in serrated lesions, and the lack of&#xD;
      well-designed longitudinal studies for the detection of metachronic lesions. The current&#xD;
      criteria for classifying these lesions seem weak to define the CRC risk for a specific&#xD;
      patient, thus the proposed follow-up intervals are not based on strong scientific evidence. A&#xD;
      thorough study of serrated lesions relating their molecular and histological characteristics&#xD;
      with lesions found on colonoscopic follow-up could establish a new molecular classification&#xD;
      aimed to design a patient-oriented follow-up strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS The correlation of epidemiological data of the patient, histological&#xD;
      characteristics and molecular alterations of SP of the colon, along with findings in the&#xD;
      endoscopic follow-up, would allow to identify stratified groups of patients according to&#xD;
      their risk of developing advanced lesions and CRC in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To deepen the knowledge of histology and genetic alterations of SP and thereby try to&#xD;
           establish a molecular classification that may serve as a basis for new endoscopic&#xD;
           follow-up guidelines. These recommendations would be more reliable and adjusted to the&#xD;
           patient's individual risk profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To establish the prevalence of serrated lesions, especially SSP/SSA and SSP with&#xD;
           dysplasia, in the FOBT positive CRC screening population.&#xD;
