  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A double-blind, randomized crossover design with five arms including four experimental&#xD;
      conditions and placebo will be applied. After having successfully completed screening&#xD;
      procedures, eligible participants will be invited to five separate test days. The test days&#xD;
      cannot be within the same week, however there is no upper limit for days in between, as long&#xD;
      as the participants remain weight stable and do not change diet or physical activity level.&#xD;
      Significant changes in diet, physical activity level (evaluated by the sub-investigator) or&#xD;
      weight change ±3 kg over the course of the study (from screening to completion of the last&#xD;
      test day) results in exclusion of that subject.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For standardization, 48 hours before the test days, the participants will be asked to consume&#xD;
      a regular diet compliant to what they usually eat and no excessive alcohol consumption (not&#xD;
      above 5 units and no alcohol at all from 8 pm the night before the test days) or intense&#xD;
      physical activity compared to what they normally do is allowed. Additionally, the&#xD;
      participants must arrive at the study facilities in the morning after an overnight fast (from&#xD;
      10 pm) using non strenuous means of transportation. Furthermore, over the course of the study&#xD;
      (from screening (visit 1) to completion of the last test day (visit 6)), the participants are&#xD;
      not allowed to change body weight (±3 kg), diet or physical activity level (as judged by the&#xD;
      sub-investigator). The participants will be weighed and asked about compliance with&#xD;
      additional standardization in a room away from the other participants before initiating each&#xD;
      test day. Possible in-compliance with the standardization will be judged by the&#xD;
      sub-investigator whether to result in re-scheduling of the visit or to be recorded as a&#xD;
      protocol deviation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants arrive at the study facility at 07:30 in the morning. Compliance with&#xD;
      standardization is controlled along with registration of possible adverse events, use of&#xD;
      concomitant medications and consumption of fermented milk products. During the test days,&#xD;
      participants are settled together in an open office, where they are separated at individual&#xD;
      tables. During the meals, participants are settled into individual feeding cubicles, where&#xD;
      they cannot see each other and are instructed not to talk to each other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visual analogue scales (VAS') will be completed for measurement of fasting subjective&#xD;
      appetite levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The test products (capsules) will be provided 30 minutes prior to a standardized fixed&#xD;
      breakfast (providing 2000 kJ) and 60 minutes prior to a standardized fixed mid-morning snack&#xD;
      (providing 1500 kJ). An ad libitum test meal will be provided 6 hour after first provision of&#xD;
      capsules (time 0). There will be 2 hour interval between the two servings of capsules and 4&#xD;
      hour interval between the second serving of capsules and the ad libitum test meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediately before and after each episode of capsules and food consumption and at 30 minutes&#xD;
      intervals, VAS' will be completed.&#xD;
