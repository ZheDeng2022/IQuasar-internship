  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effect of anti-tumor treatment is not satisfying in HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma&#xD;
      (HBV-HCC) for reasons that HBV-HCC carries highly heterogeneous antigens to facilitate cancer&#xD;
      cells escaping from immune surveillance and constructs an immunosuppressive microenvironment.&#xD;
      Correspondingly, dendritic cells activated by HBV antigen peptides and HepG2 cell protein&#xD;
      lysate can efficiently present T cells with antigens of HCC to sensitize their antitumor&#xD;
      properties meanwhile cyclophosphamide(CY) can effectively improve the microenvironment of&#xD;
      immunity. Therefore, we put forward a new scientific therapy called &quot;Activated&#xD;
      Dendritic-cells Combined Cyclophosphamide&quot; (ADCC) combining with TACE for patients with&#xD;
      advanced hepatocellular carcinoma to prolong their survival time.&#xD;

      Patients who have good compliance complying with the inclusion criteria will be enrolled into&#xD;
      our research. The 70 patients will be randomly assigned to experimental group and control&#xD;
      group with the ratio of 1:1, one group (control group) will go on receiving the TACE&#xD;
      treatment solely; another group (experimental group) after enrollment will receive TACE in&#xD;
      the first course.Then 10ml blood is taken for activated dendritic cells culture.CY treatment&#xD;
      will be performed on patients in reasonable dose two days before the second TACE.The day when&#xD;
      the second TACE performed, these patients will receive activated-dendritic cells&#xD;
      simultaneously. 31 days after the first TACE therapy, all patients are determined if they&#xD;
      should continue an additional course by monitoring their blood parameters, tumor indicators&#xD;
      and imaging examinations. Additionally, we are setting up a treatment course containing 31&#xD;
      days and going to change one course into 93 days after the third course.&#xD;

    <description>The first course :&#xD;
Patients in the first day of a clinical course will be performed TACE solely and keep 40ml blood sample as baseline sample for scientific research;in the 17th day, 10ml blood will be taken to culture activated dendritic cells;in 29th day, cyclophosphamide(CY) 250mg/m2 is used through an intravenous drip;in 31th day,patients are going to be performed TACE,1-2*10^8 activated dendritic cells are dripped through peripheral vein, 40ml blood sample will be taken for clinical research, simultaneously.&#xD;
The 31th day in the first course is the same as the first day of the second course, then we come to next therapy course.&#xD;
31 days are a course of treatment, health conditions of patients who participate in will be monitored closely in the process. After previous 3-courses followed-up period, one course will be changed into 93 days.</description>

    <description>Every course:&#xD;
In the first day,patients are performed TACE solely and taken 40ml blood as baseline sample for scientific research;in the 29th day,patients are needed to reach hospital to check related indicators. In the 31th day, patients are performed TACE again.&#xD;
The 31th day is the same as the first day in the second course.&#xD;
31 days are a course of treatment, health conditions of patients who participate in will be monitored closely in the process. After previous 3-courses followed-up period, one course will be changed into 93 days.</description>
