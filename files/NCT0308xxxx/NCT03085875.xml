      This study will take advantage of the open source framework of ResearchKit developed by Apple&#xD;
      to bring research directly to participants. Using the ResearchKit platform as well as a stand&#xD;
      alone app available for Android and HTML, it makes it easier to enroll large numbers of&#xD;
      participants and carry out real-world health research to answer questions important to a&#xD;
      broad population.&#xD;

      -  Eligibility determined, Individuals enrolled and consented to join study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Short Intake Survey (demographic and baseline health information collected)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Health History Survey (two days after participant enrolls in the study)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Survey questions about current health and medical history will be sent to participants&#xD;
           weekly. If participants had a prenatal visit during the week, a few additional questions&#xD;
           will be asked.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Twins / Multiples survey will begin appearing when a participant indicates they are&#xD;
           having more than one baby&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants can submit home measurements of, weight and blood pressure as frequently as&#xD;
           they want through HealthKit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy outcome variables. (Miscarriage, stillbirth, birth of healthy baby, or&#xD;
           pregnancy ended) will also be asked weekly.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the baby is born, questions about labor and delivery, as well as weight, size and&#xD;
           birth date of the baby will be asked. A reminder to fill out the outcome survey will be&#xD;
           given 4 weeks after a user's due date.&#xD;
