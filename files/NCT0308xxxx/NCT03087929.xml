  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A previous phase II trial entitled Treatment of Follicular non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma with High&#xD;
      Dose Therapy and Stem Cell Support Followed by Consolidative Immunotherapy with Rituximab and&#xD;
      Alpha Interferon was conducted at the Odette Cancer Centre between 2005 and 2012. The primary&#xD;
      objectives of this previous trial was to assess progression free survival and overall&#xD;
      survival. Of the 36 patients in this trial, approximately 18 remain in remission. In this new&#xD;
      follow up trial, follow up data will prospectively be collected on patients who provide&#xD;
      informed consent to do so.&#xD;
