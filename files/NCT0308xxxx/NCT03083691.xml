  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BIOLUMA is a multicentric non-randomised phase II trial in patients with non-squamous&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (Cohort 1) and patients with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC)&#xD;
      (Cohort 2) after failure of platinum-based first-line therapy. NSCLC patients are treated&#xD;
      with nivolumab until disease progression and subsequently receive a combination therapy of&#xD;
      nivolumab and ipilimumab. SCLC patients receive four cycles of nivolumab in combination with&#xD;
      ipilimumab and subsequent nivolumab monotherapy. Primary endpoint for both cohorts is overall&#xD;
      response rate of combination therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within the diagnostic part tumor biopsies will be analysed. Tumor tissue will be obtained&#xD;
      before initiation of therapy and after progression on nivolumab monotherapy before addition&#xD;
      of ipilimumab in Cohort 1 and after completion of the four nivolumab/ipilimumab combination&#xD;
      cycles before continuation of nivolumab monotherapy in Cohort 2, respectively. Flow cytometry&#xD;
      of blood samples and microbiome analysis of deep rectal swaps are performed prior to therapy&#xD;
      as well as during course of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1(NSCLC) is closed for enrollment due to Sponsor decision&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Cohort 2 (SCLC) a Prescreening for high Tumor Mutation Burden is necessary before&#xD;
      enrollment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cohort 2 (SCLC) has been subdivided by amendment in Cohort 2a without prescreening and Cohort&#xD;
      2b with TMB-prescreening. For Cohort 2a enrolment has been stopped in December 2017.&#xD;
      Enrolment in Cohort 2b is still ongoing.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The treatment period is subdivided in Treatment Part A and B which differ between the two cohorts:&#xD;
Cohort 1 (non-squamous NSCLC):&#xD;
During Treatment Part A nivolumab 240 mg IV q2w as monotherapy is administered. At time of disease progression another re-biopsy is mandatory before initiation of combination therapy (Treatment Part B). Within Treatment Part B, nivolumab is given in a dose of 3 mg/kg q2w together with ipilimumab 1 mg/kg IV q6w.&#xD;
Cohort 2 (SCLC):&#xD;
Patients have to undergo a prescreening for high Tumor Mutation Burden. Within Treatment Part A, nivolumab 1 mg/kg q3w together with ipilimumab 3 mg/kg q3w for a total of four doses is administered. After the four combined doses have been administered, another re-biopsy is mandatory before initiation of Treatment Part B. In Treatment Part B, nivolumab 240 mg q2w monotherapy is administered until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.</intervention_model_description>
