  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infection and cancer is a major cause of death and morbidity, and may be preventable through&#xD;
      vaccination. It is not fully understood at the molecular level why some people respond better&#xD;
      than others to vaccines until now the technology to assess this has not been available. This&#xD;
      has impaired vaccine development. The overall goal of the Human Vaccines Project is to&#xD;
      understand the 'rules' of how vaccines work. In this demonstration project the investigators&#xD;
      will vaccinate healthy adults with hepatitis B vaccine to start to understand better how it&#xD;
      works, ultimately helping with rational vaccine design in the future.&#xD;
