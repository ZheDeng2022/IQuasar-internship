  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pregnancy is associated with an increase in nutrient requirements. During this period, women&#xD;
      would be keener on adopting healthier behaviors. Thus, pregnancy represents an opportunity to&#xD;
      improve the nutrient adequacy of the diet of mothers-to-be. This study is a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial, which aims at evaluating the efficiency of a tailored dietary advice tool&#xD;
      in improving the nutrient adequacy of the diet of pregnant women, as measured by the PANDiet.&#xD;
      Eighty pregnant women will be included in the study and randomized either in the &quot;control&quot;&#xD;
      group, or in the &quot;intervention&quot; group. The control group will receive generic dietary advice&#xD;
      based on a booklet edited by the French Institute for Health Promotion and Health Education&#xD;
      (INPES). The intervention group will receive the same generic dietary advice plus tailored&#xD;
      dietary advice to improve the nutrient adequacy of their observed diets. Dietary intakes will&#xD;
      be evaluated online using a 3 days food record, at baseline and 6 weeks after patients&#xD;
      received the booklet and/or the first tailored dietary advice. Thus, the nutrient adequacy of&#xD;
      the diet could be evaluated before and after the intervention in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dietary follow-up for one patient will last 12 weeks only, but data will be collected at&#xD;
      delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Moreover, after, the 12-week dietary follow-up and before their deliveries, 10 participants&#xD;
      (5 by group) will be contacted to participate in a qualitative interview. This interview will&#xD;
      aim at understanding barriers and motivators to implement dietary advice (generic and/or&#xD;
      tailored) in the diet of pregnant women in the study.&#xD;

    <description>The nutrient adequacy of the diet of each patient will be evaluated, at baseline, by a diet quality index: the PANDiet. Then, tailored dietary advice aiming at improving the nutrient adequacy of the diet will be generated for each patient in the arm #2. Patients will choose 3 tailored dietary advices among 3 options during three appointments with a research project team member (the first in person and the second and the third by phone). Each appointment will be spaced of 2 weeks. In total, each patient in the arm #2 will choose nine tailored dietary advice. Tailored dietary advices are of two kinds: substitution of a consumed food item by a food item in the same food subgroup or modification of the consumed amount (increase or decrease) of a food item. Tailored dietary advices cannot generate an increase of more than 190 kcal or a decrease as compared to the observed energy intake.</description>
