    <textblock>
      This PAR (participatory action research) study to improve antibiotic prescribing quality in a&#xD;
      GPC (general practitioner cooperative) during OOH-care (out-of-hours-care) uses a mixed&#xD;
      methods approach using qualitative as well as quantitative techniques. In a first exploratory&#xD;
      phase we will work on partnership development and mapping the existing issues. In a second&#xD;
      phase the focus will be on facilitating change and implementing interventions through PDSA&#xD;
      (plan do study act) cycles. In a third phase outcomes on prescribing quality during and&#xD;
      outside office hours will be evaluated. Equally important is the process evaluation and&#xD;
      theory building on improving antibiotic prescribing through PAR.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Phase 1: Exploring In the exploratory phase of this research the focus will first be on&#xD;
      partnership development and engaging the GPs with this research project. The success of the&#xD;
      PAR approach depends on the willingness of the stakeholders to play an active role.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To map the willingness to participation and the need to change, contacts with the GPs of the&#xD;
      GPC are planned. Emphasis will be put on the fact that the partnership is non-judgmental, has&#xD;
      a reciprocal character, and is based on trustworthiness. Developing a positive partnership&#xD;
      with the GPs will be essential. A first contact with the board of the GPC has already taken&#xD;
      place, and they expressed their willingness to participate in this project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Next, narrative research will be undertaken to explore how the different stakeholders&#xD;
      experience or make sense of antibiotic prescribing within their setting. By better&#xD;
      understanding GPs' behaviour and taking into account the different barriers they experience,&#xD;
      we will be able to understand their conduct and to develop interventions with better chances&#xD;
      of success and bigger support from the GPs. Individual in-depth interviews will be performed&#xD;
      with the relevant identified stakeholders (GPs, manager, etc.). A semi-structured interview&#xD;
      guide will be used. Topics consist on the one hand on the specifics on prescribing&#xD;
      antibiotics in OOH primary care, the perceived need and the receptiveness to change, local&#xD;
      antibiotic prescribing culture and habits etc. and on the other hand on the willingness to&#xD;
      participate in PAR, the degree of commitment in being a co-researcher, the perceived&#xD;
      viability of the project etc. Purposeful sampling will be performed to obtain a relevant&#xD;
      variety in participants that reflects our specific setting (young vs experienced GPs, solo vs&#xD;
      group practice during office hours, ethnical background etc.). Scientific rigour is ensured&#xD;
      by using triangulation and member checks involving first the participants in the interviews&#xD;
      and second all other stakeholders (see Phase 2). The GPs who have contributed to the&#xD;
      interviews will receive a formal analysis report with the summary of the findings and will be&#xD;
      asked to deliver feedback (member checking, but also reflecting on it) in a focus group. In a&#xD;
      second phase this will be made available to all GPs of the GPC. Coding of the first three to&#xD;
      five interviews will be done by two researchers independently (AC, a GP and SA, a&#xD;
      sociologist). The coding framework will then be developed by consensus of these two&#xD;
      researchers. Following the independent coding, the initial thematic framework will be&#xD;
      compared, and similarities and differences will be discussed and amended to create a set of&#xD;
      themes that represents both analyses. This thematic framework will be used for further&#xD;
      analysis and if new themes emerge this will be discussed amongst the research team. The&#xD;
      interim analyses will be critically looked at by the other three members of the&#xD;
      multidisciplinary research team and will be adapted after their feedback.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To develop a clear view on the why and when antibiotics are prescribed in OOH primary care an&#xD;
      ethnographic study will be setup. If consent is given by the GPs we will use video&#xD;
      observations to achieve a better understanding of the context, difficulties, clinical issues,&#xD;
      patient-doctor interactions etc. during prescribing antibiotics in OOH primary care. It gives&#xD;
      the possibility to gain insight in GPs habits in their natural, real-world setting. The&#xD;
      videos will be observed solely by the research team. Complete anonymity of the GPs and&#xD;
      patients will be guaranteed. Using video-observations can be a sensitive method for GPs in&#xD;
      practice, but a review showed that from an ethical and practical point of view recording&#xD;
      consultations is generally acceptable to both patients and GPs. The data collected through&#xD;
      video observations will be analysed on the one hand for research purposes and on the other&#xD;
      hand to guide the intervention development. During the interviews of phase 1 the use of&#xD;
      video-observations and possible related barriers will be discussed with the participants.&#xD;
      During the interviews we explore the thoughts of the GPs about receiving personal feedback or&#xD;
      the possibility to discuss the videos with one of the researchers or with their peers.&#xD;
      Another question is asked about the thoughts about using the videos solely as transcripts for&#xD;
      research or also for peer education, or even to use them in video-format with peers. Hence,&#xD;
      the way we will use the video material will depend on the willingness or preference of the&#xD;
      participants in our action research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because PAR is setup together with the participants having a voice in the design of the&#xD;
      study, alternative data collection methods to gain insight in the daily practice of using&#xD;
      antibiotics in OOH primary care can be suggested and subsequently applied. Alternative&#xD;
      methods could be a live observation by a member of the research team, a study of the&#xD;
      anonymised electronical medical health records, standardised patients, patient interviews,&#xD;
      case vignettes, etc..&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antibiotic prescribing quality at the level of the GPC will be assessed before the start of&#xD;
      the PAR using well-established APQI applied before in this setting. For the six most common&#xD;
      indications for antibiotic prescribing (in descending order: acute bronchitis (ICPC (6) code&#xD;
      R78), acute upper RTI (R74), cystitis/other urinary infection (UTI; U71), acute tonsillitis&#xD;
      (R76), acute/chronic sinusitis (R75), and acute otitis media (H71)) and for pneumonia (R81)&#xD;
      values of three quality indicators will be calculated and fed back:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. = the percentage of patients prescribed an antibiotic;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. = a. and receiving the guideline recommended antibiotic;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. = a and receiving quinolones. The APQI values will be calculated before the start of the&#xD;
           PAR in phase 1 and will be used during the PDSA (plan-do-study-act) cycle(s) of phase 2&#xD;
           as a quantitative indicator of antibiotic prescribing quality improvement in OOH primary&#xD;
           care. In the data-analyses the focus will be on lowering antibiotic prescribing as well&#xD;
           as on improving the proportion of receiving a recommended antibiotic and lowering the&#xD;
           use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. But, the involved GPs can choose to develop&#xD;
           interventions that target all these elements or target only one specific problem. The&#xD;
           participants will have their saying not only in the action process itself, but also on&#xD;
           how it will be evaluated so matching interventions and assessments have to be chosen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will be able to use data collected through the electronic medical health records.&#xD;
      iCAREdata (Improving Care And Research Electronic Data Trust Antwerp; www.icaredata.eu), i.e.&#xD;
      a research database linking and collecting routine data from all GPCs covering out-of-hours&#xD;
      primary care in Antwerp, allows us to deliver up to date feedback and evaluate interventions&#xD;
      at GPC level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: Facilitating change Next PAR will focus on planning and implementing interventions,&#xD;
      based on the findings in phase 1. Participants are encouraged to be involved in defining the&#xD;
      nature of change and the activities to accomplish this change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second phase of our study qualitative and quantitative results of phase 1 will be fed&#xD;
      back to all participants in the PAR. In reflective peer group sessions the barriers and&#xD;
      opportunities will be explored and interventions will be co-designed together with PAR&#xD;
      participants taking into account previous work as well as the current scientific knowledge.&#xD;
      By reflecting and interacting with each other, a joint strategy grounded in the reality of&#xD;
      OOH primary care practice can originate. Interventions will be delivered and assessed at GPC&#xD;
      level, but since the intervention(s) will be co-created with the stakeholders, at this stage&#xD;
      it is unclear how the intervention will look like and at who it will be aimed, the individual&#xD;
      GP, the patients, both or any other relevant stakeholder or structure. Every GP of the region&#xD;
      is on call for several times every year and thus will be exposed to the intervention(s).&#xD;
      There are recognised difficulties in measuring effectiveness of interventions in PAR and&#xD;
      using PDSA cycles, because of the many variables in a complex situation. The evaluation of&#xD;
      action research therefore is not solely a change intervention, but more a research approach&#xD;
      with change and knowledge outcomes, where qualitative findings on context, process and views&#xD;
      of participants are a part of.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The feasibility and acceptability of the implemented interventions will be studied from the&#xD;
      perspectives of the GPs, but also from the perspective of the patients. Process indicators&#xD;
      will depend on the type of interventions and implementation strategies chosen by the&#xD;
      stakeholders. If, for example, they choose for an internet-based communication skills&#xD;
      training such as GRACE INTRO, the number of patient information booklets, which are an&#xD;
      integral part of this intervention, distributed to patients could serve as a process&#xD;
      indicator. But also the experiences, views, acceptability, etc. of patients receiving this&#xD;
      intervention will be explored and be taken into account into the adaptation of the&#xD;
      interventions. At this point the research group does not have a preference for the type of&#xD;
      interventions that will be implemented, but they do have the knowledge of existing,&#xD;
      appropriate and effective interventions to support the GPs wishes and needs. We aim to run&#xD;
      the PDSA cycle a minimum of two times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this implementation phase of the study will be reported using the &quot;Standards&#xD;
      for Reporting Implementation Studies&quot; (StaRI) checklist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3: Evaluation In the third phase the impact of the interventions on the quality of&#xD;
      antibiotic prescribing will be evaluated. But equal importance will be given to the&#xD;
      evaluation of the process of PAR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will evaluate the quality of antibiotic prescribing based on the APQI values for OOH&#xD;
      primary care, but also aim to assess any spill over effect to primary care during office&#xD;
      hours of improving the quality of antibiotic use outside office hours. The effect on&#xD;
      antibiotic use during office hours will be assessed using Intermutualistic Agency (IMA,&#xD;
      www.nic-ima.be) data. Hence, the latter outcome measurement will have complete response, and&#xD;
      will not interfere with the normal routine of the eligible GPs, allowing a more valid&#xD;
      estimate of any spill over effect than databases who recover data from the recording by GPs&#xD;
      into their own system. Since IMA data have no link with diagnoses and are data from the&#xD;
      dispensing of the medication to the patient, the effect on antibiotic use in general and in&#xD;
      relevant subgroups defined by age and gender will be assessed rather than the prescribing by&#xD;
      diagnosis. The quality of the IMA data does not depend on the quality of recording by the&#xD;
      GPs, in contrast to the OOH care data. In Belgium every GP is obliged to be on call in the&#xD;
      GPC of his/her own region, meaning that one GPC covers all the GPs of one specific&#xD;
      well-defined region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The process evaluation aims to deepen our understanding of how, why and what was learnt from&#xD;
      the project. Participatory Action Research refers to a range of research methods that&#xD;
      emphasise the importance of participants and action. It uses methods that involve iterative&#xD;
      processes of reflection and action. Although most of the PAR methods involve qualitative&#xD;
      techniques, increasingly quantitative and mixed methods are used, which we will also combine.&#xD;
      The main emphasis however is on the process. The main objectives are to explore, to see&#xD;
      whether the process is adequate (to see whether the intervention and outcomes are occurring&#xD;
      (so is there a change in prescribing)) and to explain how and why does implementation of the&#xD;
      intervention lead to effects (so develop or expand a theory to explain the relationships&#xD;
      between concepts and the reason for the change).The concept of analytic generalisation, by&#xD;
      linking our particular findings to theory, allows to apply the research findings not only in&#xD;
      similar contexts, but to other groups and contexts as well.45 Dissemination of this model to&#xD;
      other GPCs and other GP settings is one of the deliverables.&#xD;
