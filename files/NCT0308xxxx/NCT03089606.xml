      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      Explore association between intensity of C11-AMT PET at baseline, as measured by mean&#xD;
      standardized uptake value (SUVmax at each lesion), total tumor metabolic volume, measurement&#xD;
      of intra-tumoral and inter-lesional heterogeneity), with objective response rate (ORR) at 12&#xD;
      weeks as defined via RECIST 1.1 to pembrolizumab in patients with Programmed Death (PD)-1&#xD;
      inhibitor-naïve unresectable stage III or distant metastatic (AJCC stage IV) melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimate ORR (CR + PR) by RECIST 1.1 at 12 weeks to pembrolizumab in patients with PD-1&#xD;
      inhibitor-naïve unresectable stage III or distant metastatic metastatic melanoma (AJCC stage&#xD;
      III/IV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimate progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with unresectable stage III or distant&#xD;
      metastatic melanoma treated with pembrolizumab as front-line therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Explore associations in SUVmax and other PET parameters (e.g. total tumor metabolic volume,&#xD;
      measurement of intra-tumoral and inter-lesional heterogeneity) between C11-AMT PET and&#xD;
      fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Explore associations between SUVmax, and other PET parameters (e.g. total tumor metabolic&#xD;
      volume, measurement of intra-tumoral and inter-lesional heterogeneity) identified at baseline&#xD;
      C11-AMT PET imaging with expression of components of the Indoleamine-pyrrole 2,3-dioxygenase&#xD;
      (IDO) pathway detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) or immunofluorescence (LAT1, IDO, TPH1),&#xD;
      lymphocyte subtypes (CD4, cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8), FoxP3, MDSC), PD-1/PD-L1, and&#xD;
      other immune checkpoint pathways (LAG3, glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor&#xD;
      (GITR), TIM3) in freshly acquired tumor specimens prior to treatment with pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assess metabolic changes at week 12 (or earlier, if patient progresses) following treatment&#xD;
      with pembrolizumab using baseline and week 12 FDG PET.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outline:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam, medical history, and laboratory tests, as per standard of care. Brain MRI and&#xD;
      Whole body FDG PET/CT scan with IV contrast will be performed at least 24 hours before&#xD;
      C11-AMT PET scanning. Although, the FDG PET/CT scan with IV contrast is preferred the&#xD;
      following baseline measurements may be used if they have occurred within the below specified&#xD;
      windows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Whole body FDG PET/CT scan without IV contrast, will be accepted for study purposes&#xD;
           (i.e. correlation between baseline FDG PET scan and baseline C11-AMT scan) if it has&#xD;
           occurred within 28 days before the C11-AMT PET scan. In this case, the patient will only&#xD;
           be required to have a baseline CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (also neck, if&#xD;
           applicable) with IV contrast within 28 days of starting pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. CT scan with IV contrast will be accepted for study purposes (i.e. baseline tumor&#xD;
           assessment) if it has occurred within 28 days of starting pembrolizumab. In this case,&#xD;
           the patient will only be required to have a baseline PET scan without CT coregistration&#xD;
           28 days prior to C11-AMT. This is to correlate baseline FDG PET with baseline C11-AMT&#xD;
           PET parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If eligibility criteria are met, patients will proceed to Study Related Scans and Biopsy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      C11-AMT PET will be performed at least 24 hours before pembrolizumab treatment and at least&#xD;
      24 hours after FDG PET/CT scan. A research biopsy will be performed before pembrolizumab&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After screening and study related scans and biopsy, treatment will consist of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab 200mg IV flat dose will be administered over 30 minutes on Day 1; Pembrolizumab&#xD;
      dosing will be repeated every 3 weeks until progression or subject withdrawal for other&#xD;
      reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whole body FDG PET/CT scan with IV contrast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Projected Accrual:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 25 subjects who have not received prior therapy for their recent diagnosis of distant&#xD;
      metastatic melanoma.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Sign written informed consent and HIPAA authorization for release of personal health&#xD;
             information. Note: HIPAA authorization may be included in the informed consent or&#xD;
             obtained separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject must be 18 years of age or more on the day of signing informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Have histologic or cytologic biopsy-proven diagnosis of unresectable stage III or&#xD;
             distant metastatic melanoma, irrespective of histologic type (i.e. cutaneous, unknown&#xD;
             primary, mucosal, or ocular). Patients with resectable bulky stage IIIB or stage IIIC&#xD;
             melanoma (for example at least 2.5-cm in shortest diameter for lymph nodes infiltrated&#xD;
             by tumor and at least 2-cm in longest diameter for non-lymph nodes infiltrated by&#xD;
             tumor) can also be entered into the study at the discretion of the Principal&#xD;
             Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Have measurable disease based on RECIST v1.1. for solid tumors&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Be willing to undergo fresh tumor tissue biopsy of an accessible tumor lesion prior to&#xD;
             pembrolizumab. A mandatory fresh biopsy will be collected following C11-AMT PET&#xD;
             imaging. Subjects for whom fresh samples cannot be provided (e.g. inaccessible or&#xD;
             subject safety concern) or do not agree to this fresh tumor research biopsy of&#xD;
             accessible tumor will be deemed ineligible for study participation. Exception to the&#xD;
             mandatory tumor tissue collection are patients with metastatic lung lesions as the&#xD;
             only site of metastatic disease. Fresh biopsy collection from these subjects will be&#xD;
             optional, due to high risk of pneumothorax.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Be willing to allow for investigators to collect archival tumor tissues from surgical&#xD;
             procedures that may have been performed before or after enrollment into this trial for&#xD;
             research purposes (in-house cases and/or outside cases). These samples will be&#xD;
             obtained by study staff as long as subject continues on follow-up. Blocks of tissue&#xD;
             will be requested, and if blocks are not able to be obtained, 5micron slides (10-15)&#xD;
             will be sufficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Be willing to be injected with 11C-methyl-L-tryptophan (C11-AMT)&#xD;

             Performance Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Has not received prior therapy with cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen (CTLA)-4,&#xD;
             PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, other co-stimulatory or co-inhibitory immune checkpoint&#xD;
             antibody therapies (e.g. LAG3, TIM3, cluster of differentiation (CD) 137, Killer&#xD;
             immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR3DL), cluster of differentiation (CD) 70, and CD27)&#xD;
             for distant metastatic melanoma. Patients who have received mitogen-activated protein&#xD;
             kinase (MAPK) inhibitors are allowed on condition that they have recovered from&#xD;
             adverse events to at most Grade 1 by CTCAE v4.03 and at least 15 days have elapsed&#xD;

               -  Papillary thyroid cancer. Since this malignancy very infrequently metastasizes&#xD;
                  distantly, patients with concurrent metastatic melanoma can be enrolled even if&#xD;
                  patients may: A) have just completed thyroidectomy within the last 2 years, B)&#xD;
                  have not received adjuvant radioactive iodine therapy, C) were only recently&#xD;
                  diagnosed with asymptomatic papillary thyroid cancer and their surgery is&#xD;
                  pending.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  History of malignancy provided patient has completed therapy and is free of&#xD;
                  disease for ≥ 2 years. If patient had other malignancy within the last 2 years&#xD;
                  from which he may have been completely cured by surgery alone, he may considered&#xD;
                  to be enrolled on condition that the risk of development of distant metastatic&#xD;
                  disease based on AJCC staging system is less than 30%.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Has known active parenchymal central nervous system (CNS) metastases that are&#xD;
             symptomatic, and/or more than one lesions, and/or their largest diameter is &gt; 5-mm&#xD;
             and/or require antiepileptic drugs or corticosteroids. Patients with carcinomatous&#xD;
             meningitis are also excluded. Exceptions are: subjects with previously treated brain&#xD;
             metastases provided they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging) for&#xD;
             at least 2 weeks prior to C11-AMT and any neurologic symptoms have returned to&#xD;
             baseline, have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using&#xD;
             ongoing steroids for at least 7 days prior to C11-AMT. Patients with active (i.e. not&#xD;
             treated with stereotactive radiosurgery), single, asymptomatic, up to 5-mm in largest&#xD;
             diameter brain metastases (measured either by brain MRI with IV contrast or head CT&#xD;
             with IV contrast measured within 2 weeks prior to C11-AMT) are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years&#xD;
             (i.e. with use of disease-modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive&#xD;
             drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid&#xD;
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a&#xD;
             form of systemic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Has known history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids, or any&#xD;
             evidence of current pneumonitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality&#xD;
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's&#xD;
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of&#xD;
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with&#xD;
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the&#xD;
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit&#xD;
             through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies).&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Has known active Hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C virus (HCV) (e.g.,&#xD;
             HCV RNA [qualitative] is detected).&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Has received a live vaccine within 14 days of C11-AMT PET scan. Note: Seasonal&#xD;
             influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and are&#xD;
             allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist®) are live attenuated&#xD;
             vaccines, and are not allowed.&#xD;
