  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early initiation of treatment for Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) can prevent several of the long&#xD;
      term problems associated with the condition. However, many RA patients develop lung&#xD;
      inflammation and scarring, called 'interstitial lung disease' (RA-ILD), contributing to early&#xD;
      death in 1 in 5 people. There is no proven treatment for these patients and some medications&#xD;
      for RA can in fact worsen their lung disease. There is a need therefore to find safe&#xD;
      medications that can not only control RA joint disease, but also prevent progression of&#xD;
      RA-ILD. Abatacept is an approved drug for treating RA and is used widely. It is a newer RA&#xD;
      medication, with a unique mechanism of action, and it has been shown to prevent progression&#xD;
      of joint damage and improve physical function. The investigators aim to assess the safety of&#xD;
      this medication in patients with RA-ILD and improve our understanding of the mechanism of&#xD;
      lung damage in rheumatoid disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will perform a small clinical trial to assess the feasibility of performing&#xD;
      a larger randomized controlled trial. A total of 30 patients with RA-ILD will be treated with&#xD;
      abatacept infusions fortnightly for the first month, then every 4 weeks for a total of 20&#xD;
      weeks. In order to be eligible for the study, a patient must be able to provide written&#xD;
      informed consent, be aged ≥18 years, and have interstitial lung disease that has not&#xD;
      responded to or progressed over 6 months despite conventional immunosuppression. Change in&#xD;
      lung function (forced vital capacity) at 24 weeks will be evaluated. To assess the mechanisms&#xD;
      that may be involved with the development of ILD, the investigators will assess the effects&#xD;
      of abatacept on biomarkers obtained from the blood and the lung (bronchoalveolar lavage),&#xD;
      including markers of infection (the lung microbiome).&#xD;

Thirty participants with RA-ILD will be treated with abatacept infusions, which will be given fortnightly for the first 4 weeks, then every 4 weeks for a total of 20 weeks.&#xD;
Participants will sign informed consent at visit 1 (screening visit). There is then a 28 day window before treatment starts at visit 2 (baseline). Each participants participation in the trial is estimated to last 28 weeks from visit 1.</intervention_model_description>
