  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the effectiveness of a group intervention in the nutritional profile, in the&#xD;
      stress and in the quality of life of patients in cardiopulmonary rehabilitation. Method:&#xD;
      Randomized clinical trial using a semi-structured interview, sociodemographic and&#xD;
      anthropometric data collection, with 164 participants divided into a control group and&#xD;
      intervention group, the Food Frequency Questionnaire, the Lipp Adult Stress Symptom Inventory&#xD;
      (ISSL) ) And the SF-12 Quality of Life Assessment Questionnaire. To verify the difference in&#xD;
      nutritional profile, stress levels and quality of life between the groups, the chi-square&#xD;
      test will be used for categorical variables and within each group the comparison between the&#xD;
      moments will be through the MC Nemar test. In the quantitative variables the evaluation of&#xD;
      the interaction between group and time will be through Variance Analysis using the design in&#xD;
      Repeated Measures. Considering a significance level p &lt;0.05. Expected Results: It is believed&#xD;
      that psychological and nutritional intervention in patients participating in therapeutic&#xD;
      groups helps them to elaborate questions regarding the difficulties of coping with the&#xD;
      disease in the daily routine and to understand the importance of lifestyle care and healthy&#xD;
      habits.&#xD;

    <description>The group will take place in six meetings lasting one hour. At the end of the intervention, a new group will be started.&#xD;
Issues related to illness, cardiopulmonary rehabilitation, aroused feelings and aspects of food education will be addressed, with the objective of improving nutritional profile, quality of life and reduction of stress level. During the meeting they will be constantly encouraged to express their feelings, doubts and exchanges of experiences.&#xD;
In the first individual care (both groups) an initial consultation will be performed when the sociodemographic and anthropometric data will be collected and the instruments will be applied: Lipp Adult Stress Inventory, SF-12 Quality of Life Assessment Questionnaire and Questionnaire Of Food Frequency. After three months, all participants will be reassessed by the psychologist and nutritionist and anthropometric data will be collected and the instruments applied again.</description>
