  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying immunotherapy with or without radiation therapy as a possible&#xD;
      treatment for adenoid cystic carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The immunotherapy involved in this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pembrolizumab (MK-3475 or KEYTRUDA).&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an investigational agent to learn whether it works in treating a&#xD;
      specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab (MK-3475 or KEYTRUDA) is a humanized monoclonal antibody. An antibody is a&#xD;
      common type of protein made in the body in response to a foreign substance (particles not&#xD;
      typically found in your body such as bacteria or viruses). Antibodies attack foreign&#xD;
      substances and protect against infection. Antibodies can also be produced in the laboratory&#xD;
      for use in treating patients. Pembrolizumab is designed to restore the natural ability of the&#xD;
      immune system to recognize and target cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA recently granted approval to pembrolizumab as a treatment for patients with recurrent&#xD;
      or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Pembrolizumab has not been approved for&#xD;
      treatment against adenoid cystic carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is testing whether pembrolizumab with or without radiation is useful for patients&#xD;
      with adenoid cystic carcinoma. Radiation therapy may be used to treat some ACC tumors that&#xD;
      have spread to other parts of the body or recurred after surgery. Radiation therapy may&#xD;
      affect the immune system to improve the efficacy of pembrolizumab&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have histologically confirmed adenoid cystic carcinoma with evidence&#xD;
             of recurrent or metastatic disease not amenable to potentially curative surgery or&#xD;
             radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have at least two RECIST v1.1 measurable non-CNS based lesions.&#xD;
             Palliative radiation must be indicated for at least one of these lesions, and this&#xD;
             lesion must be a candidate for radiation to a dose of 30 Gy of radiation over 5&#xD;
             fractions as deemed by a treating radiation oncologist. Documentation of volume and&#xD;
             prescription isodose line will be collected. Re-irradiation of a previously treated&#xD;
             lesion is not allowed. One lesion must be in a location where it will not be&#xD;
             incorporated into the radiation fields so systemic response can be assessed. However,&#xD;
             inclusion of patients with more than 10 measurable lesions is strongly discouraged and&#xD;
             all patients must have life expectancy &gt; 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must agree to undergo a research biopsy, if tumor is safely accessible,&#xD;
             at baseline and after 2 cycles of pembrolizumab. Participants can be exempt if&#xD;
             archival tumor tissue has been collected within 12 months of study enrollment that the&#xD;
             Principal Investigator deems it appropriate/sufficient for analysis on this protocol.&#xD;
             Biopsy of a lesion outside of the potential radiation treatment field is preferred to&#xD;
             maintain consistency across cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have archival tissue from the primary tumor or metastases available&#xD;
             for correlative studies. Either a paraffin block or twenty unstained slides are&#xD;
             acceptable. If twenty slides are not available, a lesser amount may be acceptable&#xD;
             after discussion with the Principal Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior systemic therapy: At least 2 weeks must have elapsed since the end of prior&#xD;
             chemotherapy, biological agents (4 weeks for anti-cancer monoclonal antibody&#xD;
             containing regimens) or any investigational drug product, with adequate recovery of&#xD;
             treatment-related toxicity to NCI CTCAE Version 4.0 grade ≤1 (or tolerable grade 2) or&#xD;
             back to baseline (except for alopecia or neuropathy). Any number of prior therapies&#xD;
             for recurrent/metastatic ACC are allowed, with the exception of previous treatment&#xD;
             with PD-1 pathway inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior radiation therapy: At least 3 weeks must have elapsed from prior radiation&#xD;
             therapy. The prior site of radiotherapy must be documented as reirradiation of the&#xD;
             same site is not allowed in this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be ≥ 18 years of age on day of signing informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a performance status of 0 or 1 on the ECOG Performance Scale (see Appendix A).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have documentation of a new or progressive lesion on a radiologic&#xD;
             imaging study performed within 12 months prior to study enrollment (progression of&#xD;
             disease over any interval is allowed) and/or new/worsening disease related symptoms&#xD;
             within 12 months prior to study enrollment. This assessment is performed by the&#xD;
             treating investigator. Evidence of progression by RECIST criteria is not required.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Metastatic disease impinging on the spinal cord or threatening spinal cord&#xD;
             compression. Patients that have had previous treatment of disease with impinging on&#xD;
             the cord with either surgery or radiotherapy with clinical or radiographic evidence of&#xD;
             response or stability are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Surgical fixation of bone lesion to be irradiated is required and indicated to provide&#xD;
             mechanical stability.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or&#xD;
             carcinomatous meningitis. Subjects with previously treated brain metastases may&#xD;
             participate provided they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for&#xD;
             at least four weeks prior to the first dose of trial treatment), have no evidence of&#xD;
             new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using steroids for the purposes of&#xD;
             treating brain metastasis induced edema for at least 7 days prior to trial treatment.&#xD;
             This exception does not include carcinomatous meningitis which is excluded regardless&#xD;
             of clinical stability, because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop&#xD;
             progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic&#xD;
             and other adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior treatment with PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent administration of other cancer specific therapy or investigational agents&#xD;
             during the course of this study is not allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any&#xD;
             other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of trial&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a known history of active TB (Bacillus Tuberculosis)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions or hypersensitivity to pembrolizumab or any of its&#xD;
             excipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including but not limited to ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment.&#xD;
             Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous cell carcinoma of the&#xD;
             skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy or in situ cervical cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has known history of, or any evidence of active, non-infectious pneumonitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years&#xD;
             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive&#xD;
             drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid&#xD;
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a&#xD;
             form of systemic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality&#xD;
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's&#xD;
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of&#xD;
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father&#xD;
             children within the projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening&#xD;
             or screening visit through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment. Pregnant&#xD;
             women are excluded from this study because immunotherapy has the potential for&#xD;
             teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk&#xD;
             of adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with&#xD;
             immunotherapy, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated on this&#xD;
             protocol. Women who could potentially become pregnant while undergoing treatment on&#xD;
             this protocol must be willing to use 2 methods of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has known active Hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g., HCV RNA&#xD;
             [qualitative] is detected).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy.&#xD;
