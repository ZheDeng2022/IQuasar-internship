  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PGD is a syndrome characterized by alveolocapillary barrier structural and functional&#xD;
      alterations with surfactant inactivation and vascular permeability increase, which cause lung&#xD;
      edema, parenchymal infiltrate and progressive hypoxemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PGD may be enhanced in lung donor. Inflammatory and structural changes may be present in the&#xD;
      lungs before organ recovery and/or after organ preservation. The investigators aim to&#xD;
      identify the surfactant protein, inflammatory and structural changes in lung donor before and&#xD;
      after cold ischemia, and biomarkers to PGD in lung recipients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary graft dysfunction (PGD) is responsible of high early mortality in lung transplanted&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evolution of lung transplantation may be complicated by primary graft dysfunction (PGD),&#xD;
      a form of acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by ischemia-reperfusion-related&#xD;
      phenomena. PGD occurs in 15-50% of cases and is responsible for a significant increase in&#xD;
      mortality, duration of assisted ventilation and length of stay in intensive care. It is also&#xD;
      an important risk factor for the medium-term development of acute and long-term rejection, of&#xD;
      bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) - chronic rejection - which drastically reduces the&#xD;
      survival of the graft.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surfactant proteins comprising the secretory protein of Clara cells (16-kd Clara cell&#xD;
      protein-CC16) and surfactant proteins -A (SP-A), -B (SP-B) and -D (SP- D) are recognized as&#xD;
      markers of the permeability of the alveolocapillary barrier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these findings, we postulate that the gene expression of CC16, SP-A, -B and D is&#xD;
      altered in pulmonary biopsies performed in donors of patients developing primary graft&#xD;
      dysfunction after pulmonary transplantation compared to those performed in the donors of&#xD;
      patients free of this syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study could therefore be a complementary means of objective assessment of lung quality&#xD;
      prior to transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims and Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Describe, in the organ donor, changes in expression of Clara Cell Protein (CC16),&#xD;
           surfactant-associated proteins (A, B or D), pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in&#xD;
           circulating blood and lung tissue during organ recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Describe the biological and structural changes after the period of cold ischemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Establish a correlation between biomarkers in the organ donor and the occurrence of&#xD;
           acute graft dysfunction in the lung recipient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and method&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      All lung organ donor patients referred to our network and their recipients will be included&#xD;
      after obtaining their informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the donor, we will record demographic data (age, sex), history, cause of death, blood gas&#xD;
      measurement, chest x-ray protocol, blood biological parameters, duration of brain death if&#xD;
      appropriate and hot ischemia time if appropriate and protocol of bacteriological analyzes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the recipient, we will record the demographic data (age, sex), indication of&#xD;
      transplantation, results of right catheterization performed on pre-transplantation, standard&#xD;
      intraoperative data, immunosuppression, Blood gas, chest x-ray protocol, filling balance and&#xD;
      blood biological parameters at 24, 48 and 72h. The declamping times are recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are automatically followed up for the rest of their lives. Iterative biopsies are&#xD;
      performed in the first year to detect possible acute rejection. The data will be included in&#xD;
      our study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biological samples&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the donor, before the perfusion of the preservation solutions, 18 cc of peripheral blood&#xD;
      are taken (dry tube, 9 cc). 1 tube will be stored at -80 째 C., the other will be centrifuged&#xD;
      (15 minutes, 10000 / min, 20 째 C.) and then the serum will be stored at -80 째 C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediately after lung recovery, a pulmonary biopsy (6 cm2) is performed at the lower lobes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A fragment will be immediately placed in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 째 C. A second&#xD;
      fragment is stored in formalin for 24h and then stored in paraffin blocks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before implantation, at the end of the preservation period, a new lung biopsy is performed in&#xD;
      the lower lobes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biological analyzes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histological examination and gradation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lung tissues fixed in formalin are stained with hematoxylin-eosin to gradate lung lesions&#xD;
      [(1) neutrophil infiltration, (2) airway epithelial cell damage, (3) interstitial edema, (4)&#xD;
      Hyaline membrane and (5) hemorrhage].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inflammation, apoptosis and Surfactant proteins&#xD;
&#xD;
      O Tissue mRNA measurements: in real time Quantification PCR (RTQ-PCR)&#xD;
&#xD;
      O Tissue peptide measurements: Western Blot - ELISA - MILLIPLEX&#xD;
&#xD;
      O Treatment of blood samples and analyzes: ELISA - MILLIPLEX&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protein inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-8, IL-1, IL33) (IL-10), intercellular&#xD;
      adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, VCAM-1), apoptosis (Bax, Bcl2, Caspases)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of apoptosis: TUNEL - Immunohistochemistry&#xD;
