  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of this study is to allow the anesthesiologist to make a more informed decision&#xD;
      about the anesthetic requirement of a person prior to starting anesthesia. The preliminary&#xD;
      data collected in this study will support a larger investigation aimed at gaining a better&#xD;
      understanding of anesthetic susceptibility in general and in the elderly population which&#xD;
      appears to be at greater risk for Postoperative Cognitive Dysfunction (POCD)&#xD;
&#xD;
      POCD is a short-term decline in cognitive function (especially in memory and executive&#xD;
      functions) that may last from a few days to a few weeks after surgery. In rare cases, this&#xD;
      disorder may persist for several months after major surgery. POCD is distinct from emergence&#xD;
      delirium. It occurs most commonly in older patients and those with pre-existing cognitive&#xD;
      impairment. POCD is common in adult patients of all ages at hospital discharge after major&#xD;
      non-cardiac surgery, but only the elderly (aged 60 years or older) are at significant risk&#xD;
      for long-term cognitive problems. The body's inflammatory response to surgery likely plays an&#xD;
      important role, at least in elderly patients. Investigators also postulate that a relative&#xD;
      'anesthetic overdose' may be a significant risk factor. Hence, being able to make a better&#xD;
      judgment on the dose needed for an individual is extremely important.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Central nervous system (CNS) function is affected by sedation and anesthesia. This is evident&#xD;
      from the desired clinical effects of sedative and anesthetic drugs. Recent evidence suggests&#xD;
      that disruption CNS function may be prolonged and result in unwanted cognitive effects in&#xD;
      predisposed individuals. Investigators know that there is a considerable pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      (onset, distribution and elimination) and pharmacokinetic variability of neurotropic drugs&#xD;
      even with in persons within a certain age and weight group. What the investigators do not&#xD;
      know, is how to predict or quantify an individual's susceptibility to sedation and anesthesia&#xD;
      and, more importantly, the potential cognitive susceptibility of an individual's brain to&#xD;
      these drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Auditory functional imaging is a well validated task. It can be applied as a short (5 minute)&#xD;
      test. Investigators know (preliminary data) that the size of the brain activation area&#xD;
      changes after sedation. Investigators now postulate that this change reflects a disruption of&#xD;
      neuronal integration in the brain and that this change may be an objective measure of the&#xD;
      cognitive effects of sedation for an individual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As supportive data for an R-01 grant application the investigators propose to enroll 20&#xD;
      elderly subjects by public advertisement and quantify the effects of sedation with midazolam&#xD;
      on auditory activation (auditory fMRI) and cognitive performance (mini Mental State exam and&#xD;
      complex reaction time).&#xD;
