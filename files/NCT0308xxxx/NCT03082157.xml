  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mighty Men is a 6-month faith-based weight-loss intervention for obese African American men&#xD;
      35-74 years old. The investigators will conduct this intervention in African American&#xD;
      faith-based organizations because these organizations have the opportunity to consistently&#xD;
      reach more African American men than any other institution in the African American community.&#xD;
      African American faith-based organizations have historically served as a trusted institution&#xD;
      for filling gaps in health and social services, including cancer prevention and control&#xD;
      programs, within their natural role and function in the African American community.&#xD;
      Additionally, African American faith-based organizations are important resources and sources&#xD;
      of information for large numbers of middle-aged and older African American men, including&#xD;
      those who are not members of a faith-based organization. Though African American men attend&#xD;
      faith-based organization's at lower rates than African American women, men constitute 40% of&#xD;
      the congregation membership among the largest denominations serving African Americans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mighty Men includes: (a) tailored goals/ messages, (b) self-monitoring, (c) small group&#xD;
      training and education and (d) educational and community-based information and resources.&#xD;
      There are three specific aims for the proposed study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1 is to compare the efficacy of Mighty Men to an attention control group in a&#xD;
      cluster-randomized clinical trial of 448 African American men. The investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that men in faith-based organizations assigned to the intervention group will have lost more&#xD;
      weight than men in faith-based organizations assigned to the comparison group at 6-months,&#xD;
      and they will maintain greater weight loss than men in the control group 3-months post&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2 is to compare changes in cancer risk behaviors (e.g., healthy eating and&#xD;
      physical activity), adiposity measures (e.g., body fat), and psychosocial mediators (e.g.,&#xD;
      perceived social support, autonomous motivation) at 6-months and 3-months post intervention&#xD;
      between Mighty Men and comparison participants. The investigators hypothesize that men&#xD;
      assigned to Mighty Men will demonstrate and maintain greater improvements in eating and&#xD;
      physical activity and psychosocial mediators than those randomized to the attention control&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3 is to examine the impact of Mighty Men on the faith-based organizations that&#xD;
      participate in the intervention. The investigators will conduct a rigorous process and impact&#xD;
      evaluation to determine the extent of program reach, efficacy, adoption, implementation and&#xD;
      maintenance (RE-AIM) in African American faith-based organizations in the intervention&#xD;
      condition. Also, investigators hypothesize that faith-based organizations assigned to the&#xD;
      intervention will demonstrate greater perceived efficacy to conduct and sustain health&#xD;
      ministries for African American men and improvements in all areas of the RE-AIM framework&#xD;
      than faith-based organizations randomized to the comparison group.&#xD;

    <gender_description>Most weight loss, healthy eating and physical activity interventions for African Americans have included considerably more African American women than African American men. One of the most crucial challenges in behavioral interventions has been reaching African American men and identifying settings where interventions are sustainable over time. In the past 25 years, no community-based intervention has produced clinically significant changes in weight loss, eating practices or physical activity in African American men. The investigators propose to develop and test the first individually-tailored, weight loss intervention for African American men.</gender_description>
