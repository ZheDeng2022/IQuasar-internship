      This trial addresses the question of the viral load (VL) threshold for switching from&#xD;
      first-line to second-line antiretroviral therapy (ART). The WHO currently sets the threshold&#xD;
      at 1000 copies/mL. However, the optimal threshold for defining virological failure and the&#xD;
      need to switch ART regimen has not been determined. In fact, people with VL levels of less&#xD;
      than 1000 copies/mL, however, not fully suppressed, are at increased risk for drug resistance&#xD;
      mutations (DRM) and subsequent virological failure. In resource-limited settings where VL&#xD;
      monitoring is not as frequent as in high-income countries, this could have serious&#xD;
      implications and patients may continue on a failing regimen for a long period. Our research&#xD;
      consortium will conduct a multicenter, parallel-group, open-label, randomized clinical trial&#xD;
      in a resource-limited setting to assess whether a threshold of 100 copies/mL compared to the&#xD;
      WHO-defined threshold of 1000 copies/mL for switching to second-line ART among unsuppressed&#xD;
      HIV-positive patients on first-line ART will lead to better outcomes.&#xD;

      Study background &amp; rational:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) launched the 90-90-90 targets for&#xD;
      2020 based on the result of newly-acquired scientific evidence that - irrespective of CD4&#xD;
      count - early antiretroviral treatment (ART) for HIV-positive individuals is beneficial to&#xD;
      them and prevents HIV transmission. UNAIDS expects that the 90-90-90 targets will lead to a&#xD;
      reduction in the yearly global HIV incidence from 2 million currently to 500,000 by 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A crucial step to achieve the third pillar of the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets - 90% viral&#xD;
      suppression among HIV-positive individuals on treatment - and thus ensure a successful&#xD;
      treatment outcome is the monitoring and management of first-line ART failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since 2013, the WHO recommends routine viral load (rVL) measurement as the preferred&#xD;
      monitoring strategy in resource-limited settings and defines virological failure as confirmed&#xD;
      VL 1000 copies/mL despite good adherence. Specifically, the guidelines recommend that in case&#xD;
      of a VL ≥ 1000 copies/mL the patient should undergo enhanced adherence support and a second&#xD;
      VL test 3 months later. A second VL ≥ 1000 copies/mL with confirmed good adherence would&#xD;
      trigger the switch to a second-line regimen, whereas if the VL is &lt; 1000 copies/mL the&#xD;
      patient should continue unaltered first-line ART. However, the optimal threshold for defining&#xD;
      virological failure and the need for switching ART regimen has not yet been determined. In&#xD;
      fact, people with VL levels of less than 1000 copies/mL, but not fully suppressed (usually&#xD;
      defined as 50-100 copies/mL), are at a increased risk for drug resistance mutations (DRM) and&#xD;
      subsequent virological failure. A recently published study from our research consortium in&#xD;
      Lesotho indicates similar findings, demonstrating a significant accumulation of drug&#xD;
      resistance mutations in patients with VL levels of less than 1000 copies/mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The VL threshold of 1000 copies/mL recommended by the WHO and the Lesotho national guidelines&#xD;
      for the switch to second-line ART is likely to miss a substantial number of patients on&#xD;
      first-line ART with persisting virus replication below 1000 copies/mL with DRM. In&#xD;
      resource-limited settings where VL monitoring is not as frequent as in high-income countries,&#xD;
      this could have serious implications: after a VL below 1000 copies/mL the patient may not&#xD;
      receive a follow-up VL for up to a year, and thus may continue on a failing regimen for a&#xD;
      long period of time. In conclusion, such patients are at increased risk for DRM, accumulation&#xD;
      of further resistance mutations, drug-resistant virus transmission, and subsequent&#xD;
      virological failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our research consortium hypothesizes that in patients on first-line ART with two consecutive&#xD;
      unsuppressed VL measurements equal/more than 100 copies/mL, where the second VL is between&#xD;
      100 and 999 copies/mL, switch to second-line ART (intervention group) will lead to a higher&#xD;
      rate of viral resuppression (VL &lt; 50 copies/mL) and is therefore superior compared to not&#xD;
      switching to second-line ART according to WHO guidelines (control group, standard of care).&#xD;
