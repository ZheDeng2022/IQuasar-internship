      The epidemiology and ecology of malaria in humans includes complex interactions between human&#xD;
      hosts and mosquito vectors. These interactions are spatio-temporal in nature and are heavily&#xD;
      dependent on transportation capabilities and seasonal conditions. Where and when infections&#xD;
      are acquired is not well understood in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS), where there are&#xD;
      numerous vectors, many with different behaviours and habitats. For example, many infections&#xD;
      appear to be associated with forests or forest edges and some of the most important mosquito&#xD;
      vectors in the region are forest dwellers (Obsomer, Defourny, and Coosemans 2007).&#xD;
      Interventions that target houses at night-time (e.g. mosquito nets), have had limited success&#xD;
      in the GMS, most likely because at least some infections are acquired during the day or&#xD;
      outside of the home (Dolan et al. 1993; Luxemburger et al. 1994).&#xD;
&#xD;
      While overall malaria incidence in the region appears to be declining, the disease remains&#xD;
      persistent in small subregions, for example along international borders joining Thailand with&#xD;
      Myanmar. It will be crucial for elimination efforts to address the persistent malaria in&#xD;
      these regions, most likely requiring the use of novel and spatially targeted approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increasingly, spatial data and analyses are used in disease research (Linard and Tatem 2012;&#xD;
      Pybus et al. 2016; Tatem et al. 2012), however most spatial analyses are at aggregate scales,&#xD;
      using data from provincial or state levels. More detailed studies have a single geographic&#xD;
      reference point per individual in the study, frequently the home (Mosha et al. 2014; Parker&#xD;
      et al. 2015). These studies allow researchers to investigate potential clustering of cases&#xD;
      within and between houses (&quot;hotspots&quot;) (Bejon et al. 2014; Bousema et al. 2012; Mosha et al.&#xD;
      2014). Even these detailed studies typically ignore the spaces in which people spend time&#xD;
      outside of their home and where they may acquire infection: schools; places of worship and&#xD;
      work; forest camps and temporary shelters. Given that many malaria infections in the GMS are&#xD;
      acquired outside of the home, in areas that are not usually mapped, this information is&#xD;
      important for developing strategies to prevent transmission and will be crucial for achieving&#xD;
      elimination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers in other substantive areas have already begun mapping the movement patterns of&#xD;
      study subjects so that exposure to a variety of environmental exposures outside of the home&#xD;
      can be assessed (Matthews and Yang 2013; Vazquez-Prokopec et al. 2010). Early approaches&#xD;
      relied on travel surveys or travel diaries, both having bias of unknown magnitude. Modern&#xD;
      wearable global positioning satellite (GPS) instruments (loggers or trackers) and geographic&#xD;
      information science (GIS) enable detailed mapping and quantification of human movement&#xD;
      patterns. Through analysing differences in the movement patterns between humans who do versus&#xD;
      those that do not acquire infectious diseases, it may be possible to identify a narrower set&#xD;
      of geographic spaces in which disease transmission is occurring. Public health interventions&#xD;
      could then target those risk areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most of these detailed studies have been done in economically developed settings and urban&#xD;
      environments. Infectious diseases such as malaria remain persistent in resource-poor, rural,&#xD;
      and remote areas - the very regions that are least likely to be studied with detailed&#xD;
      approaches (Sachs and Malaney 2002).&#xD;
