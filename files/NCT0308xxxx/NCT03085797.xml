  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nasal polyps (NP) has long been known as chronic inflammatory disease of the nasal mucosa.&#xD;
      This disease is characterized by the presence of polyps in the upper nasal cavity,&#xD;
      originating from within the ostiomeatal complex. The presence of polyps can cause long-term&#xD;
      symptoms such as prominent nasal obstruction, post-nasal drip, loss of smell, and discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mepolizumab (SB240563) is an Immunoglobulin G 1 [IgG1], kappa humanized monoclonal antibody&#xD;
      (mAB) that blocks human interleukin-5 (hIL-5) from binding to the interleukin-5 (IL-5)&#xD;
      receptor complex expressed on the eosinophil cell surface and thus inhibits signaling.&#xD;
      Neutralization of IL-5 with mepolizumab has been shown to reduce blood, sputum and tissue&#xD;
      eosinophils and hence is assumed to be a treatment option in a number of eosinophilic&#xD;
      diseases including NP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this randomized, double-blind, parallel group, phase 3 (PhIII) study is to assess&#xD;
      the clinical efficacy and safety of 100 milligram (mg) subcutaneous (SC) mepolizumab as an&#xD;
      add on to maintenance treatment in adults with severe bilateral NP. The study will include a&#xD;
      4-week run in period followed by randomization to a 52-week treatment period. Participants&#xD;
      will receive mepolizumab 100 mg or placebo SC by the investigator or delegate via a&#xD;
      pre-filled safety syringe every 4 weeks for 52 weeks. Throughout the entire study period (run&#xD;
      in + treatment period + follow up), participants will receive a standard of care (SoC) for NP&#xD;
      which consists of daily mometasone furorate (MF) nasal spray, and if required, saline nasal&#xD;
      douching, occasional short courses of high dose oral corticosteroids (OCS) and/or&#xD;
      antibiotics. The treatment period will consist of thirteen, 4-weekly doses of mepolizumab or&#xD;
      placebo. In addition, up to the first 200 randomized participants will be followed up every&#xD;
      other month for up to a further 6 months after the Visit 15 (7 months post last dose) in&#xD;
      order to assess maintenance of response and to validate a physiological model derived from&#xD;
      the previous Phase 2 study. Approximately 400 participants will be randomized (200&#xD;
      participants per treatment arm) in to the study. Total duration of the study will be 76 weeks&#xD;
      for first 200 randomized participants and 52 weeks for remainder of participants who are not&#xD;
      participating in the 6 months no treatment follow up.&#xD;

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Total Endoscopic Nasal Polyps Score at Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) and Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Independent reviewers, blinded to treatment, reviewed image recordings of nasal endoscopies to determine total endoscopic NP score based on NP size. The right and left nostrils were scored from 0 to 4 (0 = No polyps; 1 = Small polyps in the middle meatus not reaching below the inferior border of the middle concha; 2 = Polyps reaching below the lower border of the middle turbinate; 3 = Large polyps reaching the lower border of the inferior turbinate or polyps medial to the middle concha; and 4 = Large polyps causing complete obstruction/congestion of the inferior meatus). The total score is the sum of the right and left nostril scores and ranges from 0 to 8, higher scores indicate greater disease severity. Data up to Week 52, including from participants who remained in the study after early discontinuation from IP, were included in analysis. Baseline was defined as Day 1 value. Change from Baseline = Post-baseline value minus Baseline value.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Nasal Obstruction Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Score During the 4 Weeks Prior to Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Weeks 49 to 52</time_frame>
    <description>Participants rated individual (nasal obstruction, nasal discharge, mucus in the throat, loss of smell, facial pain) and overall symptoms on a visual analog scale (VAS) using an electronic diary (eDiary). Captured scores ranged between 0 (none) and 100 (as bad as you can imagine), final scores derived from the electronically captured scores by dividing by 10. The final nasal obstruction VAS score ranged between 0 and 10, with higher scores indicating greater disease severity. Data up to Week 52, including from participants who remained in the study after early discontinuation from IP, were included in analysis. The average of daily scores in 4-weekly intervals were calculated and data is presented for Weeks 49-52. Baseline was defined as the average score from the 7 days of eDiary data collected prior to Day 1. Change from Baseline = Post-baseline value minus Baseline value.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Nasal Surgery Over Time</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48 and 52</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of participants with nasal surgery over time (by Weeks 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48 and 52) was derived from Kaplan-Meier time-to-event analyses for the event 'first nasal surgery'. Nasal surgery was defined as any procedure involving instruments resulting in incision and removal of tissue (polypectomy) in the nasal cavity. Time to first nasal surgery was defined as (Date of first nasal surgery - Date of first dose of study treatment) + 1. Percentage of participants with nasal surgery over time (by Weeks 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48 and 52) and corresponding 95% CI have been presented, calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Analysis included surgeries occurring up to Week 52, reported on-treatment and those reported after early discontinuation from IP by participants who remained in the study.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Sino-nasal Outcome Test (SNOT)-22 Total Score at Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) and Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The SNOT-22 is a 22-item self-reported questionnaire developed to measure symptoms and impacts related to chronic rhinosinusitis. The 22 questions are self-completed by participants based on their recall of their symptoms over the previous 2 weeks using a 6-point rating scale (0 = Not present/no problem; 1 = Very mild problem; 2 = Mild or slight problem; 3 = Moderate problem; 4 = Severe problem; 5 = Problem as &quot;bad as it can be&quot;). Scores for each question are summed to derive the total score. The SNOT-22 total score ranges from 0 to 110, with higher scores representing worse quality of life. Data up to Week 52, including from participants who remained in the study after early discontinuation from IP, were included in analysis. Baseline was defined as Day 1 value. Change from Baseline = Post-baseline value minus Baseline value.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Weeks 49 to 52</time_frame>
    <description>Participants rated individual (nasal obstruction, nasal discharge, mucus in the throat, loss of smell, facial pain) and overall symptoms on a visual analog scale using an eDiary. Captured scores ranged between 0 (none) and 100 (as bad as you can imagine), final scores derived from electronically captured scores by dividing by 10. The composite VAS score was calculated as average of individual scores of nasal obstruction, nasal discharge, mucus in the throat and loss of smell and ranged between 0 and 10, with higher scores indicating greater disease severity. Data up to Week 52, including from participants who remained in the study after early discontinuation from IP, were included in analysis. The average of daily scores in 4-weekly intervals were calculated and data is presented for Weeks 49-52. Baseline was defined as the average score from the 7 days of eDiary data collected prior to Day 1. Change from Baseline = Post-baseline value minus Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Total Endoscopic Nasal Polyps Score at Week 52</title>
        <description>Independent reviewers, blinded to treatment, reviewed image recordings of nasal endoscopies to determine total endoscopic NP score based on NP size. The right and left nostrils were scored from 0 to 4 (0 = No polyps; 1 = Small polyps in the middle meatus not reaching below the inferior border of the middle concha; 2 = Polyps reaching below the lower border of the middle turbinate; 3 = Large polyps reaching the lower border of the inferior turbinate or polyps medial to the middle concha; and 4 = Large polyps causing complete obstruction/congestion of the inferior meatus). The total score is the sum of the right and left nostril scores and ranges from 0 to 8, higher scores indicate greater disease severity. Data up to Week 52, including from participants who remained in the study after early discontinuation from IP, were included in analysis. Baseline was defined as Day 1 value. Change from Baseline = Post-baseline value minus Baseline value.</description>

        <description>Participants rated individual (nasal obstruction, nasal discharge, mucus in the throat, loss of smell, facial pain) and overall symptoms on a visual analog scale (VAS) using an electronic diary (eDiary). Captured scores ranged between 0 (none) and 100 (as bad as you can imagine), final scores derived from the electronically captured scores by dividing by 10. The final nasal obstruction VAS score ranged between 0 and 10, with higher scores indicating greater disease severity. Data up to Week 52, including from participants who remained in the study after early discontinuation from IP, were included in analysis. The average of daily scores in 4-weekly intervals were calculated and data is presented for Weeks 49-52.

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Nasal Surgery Over Time</title>
        <description>The percentage of participants with nasal surgery over time (by Weeks 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48 and 52) was derived from Kaplan-Meier time-to-event analyses for the event 'first nasal surgery'. Nasal surgery was defined as any procedure involving instruments resulting in incision and removal of tissue (polypectomy) in the nasal cavity. Time to first nasal surgery was defined as (Date of first nasal surgery - Date of first dose of study treatment) + 1. Percentage of participants with nasal surgery over time (by Weeks 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48 and 52) and corresponding 95% CI have been presented, calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Analysis included surgeries occurring up to Week 52, reported on-treatment and those reported after early discontinuation from IP by participants who remained in the study.</description>

        <description>Participants rated individual (nasal obstruction, nasal discharge, mucus in the throat, loss of smell, facial pain) and overall symptoms on a visual analog scale using an eDiary. Captured scores ranged between 0 (none) and 100 (as bad as you can imagine), final scores derived from the electronically captured scores by dividing by 10. The final overall VAS score ranged between 0 and 10, with higher scores indicating greater disease severity. Data up to Week 52, including from participants who remained in the study after early discontinuation from IP, were included in analysis. The average of daily scores in 4-weekly intervals were calculated and data is presented for Weeks 49-52. Baseline was defined as the average score from the 7 days of eDiary data collected prior to Day 1. Change from Baseline = Post-baseline value minus Baseline value.</description>

        <description>The SNOT-22 is a 22-item self-reported questionnaire developed to measure symptoms and impacts related to chronic rhinosinusitis. The 22 questions are self-completed by participants based on their recall of their symptoms over the previous 2 weeks using a 6-point rating scale (0 = Not present/no problem; 1 = Very mild problem; 2 = Mild or slight problem; 3 = Moderate problem; 4 = Severe problem; 5 = Problem as &quot;bad as it can be&quot;). Scores for each question are summed to derive the total score. The SNOT-22 total score ranges from 0 to 110, with higher scores representing worse quality of life. Data up to Week 52, including from participants who remained in the study after early discontinuation from IP, were included in analysis. Baseline was defined as Day 1 value.

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Composite VAS Score (Combining VAS Scores for Nasal Obstruction, Nasal Discharge, Mucus in the Throat and Loss of Smell) During the 4 Weeks Prior to Week 52</title>
        <description>Participants rated individual (nasal obstruction, nasal discharge, mucus in the throat, loss of smell, facial pain) and overall symptoms on a visual analog scale using an eDiary. Captured scores ranged between 0 (none) and 100 (as bad as you can imagine), final scores derived from electronically captured scores by dividing by 10. The composite VAS score was calculated as average of individual scores of nasal obstruction, nasal discharge, mucus in the throat and loss of smell and ranged between 0 and 10, with higher scores indicating greater disease severity. Data up to Week 52, including from participants who remained in the study after early discontinuation from IP, were included in analysis. The average of daily scores in 4-weekly intervals were calculated and data is presented for Weeks 49-52. Baseline was defined as the average score from the 7 days of eDiary data collected prior to Day 1. Change from Baseline = Post-baseline value minus Baseline value.</description>
