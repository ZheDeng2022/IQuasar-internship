  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Maternal nutrition is an important factor which determines fetal growth and development.&#xD;
      Micronutrients vitamin B12 and folic acid are essential determinants of one carbon metabolism&#xD;
      and play an important role in DNA synthesis, methylation and epigenetic regulation of gene&#xD;
      expression. Diabetes unit of KEMHRC, Pune has been conducting the Pune Rural Intervention in&#xD;
      Young Adolescents since last 3 years. Subjects of the PMNS cohort have been randomized as&#xD;
      part of a controlled trial of nutritional intervention with vitamin B12 vs multiple&#xD;
      micronutrient and milk protein vs placebo. This study aims to understand the&#xD;
      intergenerational effects of vitamin B12 supplementation. 74 infants have been born in this&#xD;
      trial since 2013. This study would assess neurocognitive development of offspring born to&#xD;
      mothers who are part of the nutritional intervention trial; on the Bayley scales of infant&#xD;
      and toddler development - III. The study aims to test the hypothesis that infants born to&#xD;
      mothers who received vitamin B12 would have favorable infant neurocognitive development&#xD;
      scores as compared to placebo. And this effect would be enhanced in the group whose mothers&#xD;
      received MMN with milk protein.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The concept of fetal programming suggests that adverse intrauterine growth environment&#xD;
      influences development of fetal organ structure and function, hence laying the basis for risk&#xD;
      for chronic disease in later life with its consequent effects on human capital. One of the&#xD;
      important factors determining intrauterine growth is maternal and fetal nutritional status.&#xD;
      Micronutrients vitamin B12 and folic acid are essential determinants of one carbon metabolism&#xD;
      and play an important role in DNA synthesis, methylation and epigenetic regulation of gene&#xD;
      expression. The ongoing Pune Maternal Nutritional Study (PMNS) has demonstrated an&#xD;
      association between low maternal vitamin B12 levels during pregnancy and impaired cognitive&#xD;
      functioning in offspring at 9 and 12 years of age. This observation suggests that maternal&#xD;
      micronutrient status during pregnancy can influence neurocognitive development and&#xD;
      functioning in later life. Various other intervention studies conducted in Delhi and&#xD;
      Bangladesh support that vitamin B12 and folic acid supplementation in children between 6-30&#xD;
      months of age can improve their motor and neurocognitive development. On this background the&#xD;
      Diabetes unit of KEMHRC, Pune has been conducting the Pune Rural Intervention in Young&#xD;
      Adolescents since last 3 years. Subjects of the PMNS cohort have been randomized as part of a&#xD;
      controlled trial of nutritional intervention with vitamin B12 vs multiple micronutrient and&#xD;
      milk protein vs placebo. This study aims to understand the intergenerational effects of&#xD;
      vitamin B12 supplementation. 74 infants have been born in this trial since 2013. This&#xD;
      presents a unique opportunity to study the effects of parental periconceptional vitamin B12&#xD;
      supplementation on infant neurocognitive development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective and Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare group differences, in infant neurocognitive development scores assessed at 24&#xD;
      months of age between mothers who received either vitamin B12 alone, or MMN with milk protein&#xD;
      or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Infants born to mothers who received vitamin B12 would have favorable infant&#xD;
      neurocognitive development scores as compared to placebo. And this effect would be enhanced&#xD;
      in the group whose mothers received MMN with milk protein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study subjects will include infants born to parents who are enrolled in the PRIYA trial.&#xD;
      As of August 2016, 74 infants have been born in the trial the oldest being born in June 2013.&#xD;
      The subject recruitment will be ongoing and any infants born subsequently will also be&#xD;
      included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After institutional and ethical clearance, parents of infants approaching 24 months of age&#xD;
      would be approached for study and informed consent obtained from the parents. The infant with&#xD;
      parent would be brought to KEM hospital after scheduling an appointment. Assessment Bayley&#xD;
      scales of infant and toddler development - III would be performed at the TDH center of KEM&#xD;
      hospital by a trained assessor. All assessments would be performed at age of 24±2 months. For&#xD;
      infants who are already older than 24 months assessment would be performed at their current&#xD;
      age after obtaining approval for the study from the institutional ethics committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tool:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Bayley scales of infant and toddler development - III is a standardized instrument for&#xD;
      assessing motor and neurocognitive development in infants. The scale assess development on&#xD;
      the domains of cognitive, receptive communication, expressive communication, fine motor,&#xD;
      gross motor, socio-emotional. The scale provides a general adaptive composite score along&#xD;
      with scores on the individual domains.&#xD;
