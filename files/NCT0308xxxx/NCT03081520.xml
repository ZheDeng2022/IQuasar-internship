    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to examine acute affective responses during and after a series of&#xD;
      exercise sessions with different intensities in young healthy adults. The study is a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial with three different groups (A: moderate continuous training&#xD;
      (MIT), B: high-intensity aerobe interval training (HAIT), C: high-intensity sprint interval&#xD;
      training (HIIT)). Healthy adults aged 18-40 years (n=30) will be invited to participate. Each&#xD;
      participant will perform a VO2max test followed by five session of the randomized type of&#xD;
      training. The sessions will be completed within two weeks. The participants will complete&#xD;
      questionnaires regarding exercise motivation (Behavioral Regulation of Exercise&#xD;
      Questionnaire), mood (Positive and Negative Affect Scale, Profile of Mood States, Visual&#xD;
      Analogue scale, Self-assessment Manikin Rating Scale) and perceived exhaustion (Borg Ratings&#xD;
      of Perceived Exertion scale). In addition, blood lactate and heart rate will be obtained&#xD;
      during and after each session.&#xD;

      Physical activity has is considered as one of the most important health related aspects of&#xD;
      the 21st century. In Norway, large epidemiological studies show that only about 30% of the&#xD;
      adult population meet the physical activity recommendations of 150 minutes per week with&#xD;
      moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity. Also, studies show that there are large&#xD;
      dropout rates from lifestyle interventions, and that approximately 50% drop out from physical&#xD;
      activity interventions within 6 months after start. One explanation for the dropout is&#xD;
      performance of exercise with too vigorous intensities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Very vigorous intensity physical activity can be experienced as unpleasant. According to the&#xD;
      dual-mode theory there are positive affective responses after low-to-moderate intensity&#xD;
      physical activity, whereas vigorous intensity physical activity trigger negative affective&#xD;
      responses which again can lead to reduced motivation for the exercise. Unfortunately, many of&#xD;
      the studies performed on affective responses to exercise have used one session only. The&#xD;
      studies who have examined changes in affective responses after series of exercise have used&#xD;
      vigorous intensities above the anaerobic threshold, and it is therefore unknown whether&#xD;
      similar affective responses occur in vigorous intensity aerobe exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to examine acute affective responses during and after a series of&#xD;
      exercise sessions with different intensities in young healthy adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To examine this, a randomized controlled clinical trial with three different groups (moderate&#xD;
      intensity training (MIT), high-intensity aerobic interval training (HAIT) and high-intensity&#xD;
      sprint interval training (HIIT)) will be conducted. A power calculation showed need for&#xD;
      recruitment of 30 participants. The sample will consist of healthy young adults. All&#xD;
      participants will perform one VO2max test, and five sessions with the intensity they are&#xD;
      randomized to. All six sessions (test + exercise sessions) will be conducted within two&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
