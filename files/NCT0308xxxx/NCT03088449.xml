    <textblock>
      To develop a cost-effective, individualised anti-TNF treatment strategy for patients with&#xD;
      Crohn's disease which maximizes benefit and minimises harm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to investigate the mechanisms that underlie primary&#xD;
      non-response (PNR), loss of response (LOR) and adverse drug reactions (ADRs) to anti-TNF&#xD;
      drugs in patients with active luminal Crohn's disease.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective uncontrolled cohort study investigating primary non-response (PNR),&#xD;
      loss of response (LOR) and adverse drug reactions (ADR) to IFX and ADA in patients with&#xD;
      severe active luminal Crohn's disease. The primary objective of this study is to investigate&#xD;
      the mechanisms that underlie PNR, LOR, ADRs and remission after anti-TNF withdrawal. The&#xD;
      secondary aims are to develop personalised anti-TNF treatment strategies, through the&#xD;
      identification of clinically meaningful serological and genetic predictive markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study builds on the achievements of the UK and international IBDGC in identifying IBD&#xD;
      susceptibility genes. These discoveries have provided important insights into disease&#xD;
      pathogenesis but are not expected to have an impact in the clinic for a number of years. This&#xD;
      study aims to take genetics and biomarker discovery into the IBD clinic to address questions&#xD;
      of immediate clinical importance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will commence in February 2013 utilising the network of 120 UK hospitals currently&#xD;
      participating in the UK IBDGC pharmacogenetic programme (www.ibdresearch.co.uk). The&#xD;
      collection of clinical data is aligned with the data being collected by the Royal College of&#xD;
      Physicians UK IBD Biologics Audit. The clinical data for PANTS will be collected separately&#xD;
      using a dedicated application held within the N3 network (www.pantsdb.co.uk). In order to&#xD;
      avoid duplicate data entry we will share relevant anonymised data with the UK IBD Biologics&#xD;
      Audit (and in due course with the UK IBD registry). The PANTS study aims to build a&#xD;
      bio-resource for use by the UK IBD scientific community. Anonymised data will be made&#xD;
      available to interested parties following appropriate ethical approval and consideration by&#xD;
      the scientific management committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will not be randomly allocated to one therapy or another and no attempt will be made&#xD;
      to match populations including control for disease activity. Therefore the study has not been&#xD;
      designed to directly compare PNR or LOR rates between IFX and ADA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This observational study is funded by CORE, the British Society of Gastroenterology research&#xD;
      charity and by unrestricted educational grants from Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme (MSD) and AbbVie. The&#xD;
      sponsor of the study is the Royal Devon and Exeter NHS Foundation Trust.&#xD;
