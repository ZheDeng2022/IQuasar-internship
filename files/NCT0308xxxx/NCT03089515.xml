  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many &quot;Survivors&quot; in the World Trade Center (WTC) clinical program have a clinical syndrome&#xD;
      characterized by chronic obstruction in small airways and persistence of lower respiratory&#xD;
      symptoms despite therapy. This study will test the hypothesis that persistent symptoms in WTC&#xD;
      &quot;Survivors&quot; are associated with abnormal small airways whose dysfunction is amplified during&#xD;
      exercise and is associated with biologic evidence of inflammation and remodeling. The results&#xD;
      from this study will have important treatment implications for our WTC population with&#xD;
      potential applicability to larger populations with either inhalational lung injury and/or&#xD;
      airway diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.&#xD;

    <measure>Measure of Lung Function using spirometry after inhalation of a targeted anti-muscarinic agent.</measure>
    <time_frame>4 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Spirometry (meaning the measuring of breath) is the most common of the pulmonary function tests (PFTs), measuring lung function, specifically the amount (volume) and/or speed (flow) of air that can be inhaled and exhaled.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Comparison of measure of serum marker IL-6</measure>
    <time_frame>4 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Inflammation is caused by extra protein released from the site of inflammation that circulates in the bloodstream. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP) and plasma viscosity (PV) blood tests are commonly used to detect this increase in protein. In this way they are used as markers of inflammation.</description>
