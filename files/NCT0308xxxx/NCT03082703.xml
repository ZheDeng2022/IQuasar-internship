  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized study aims at examining the impact of text messaging in the management of&#xD;
      non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a disease&#xD;
      frequently associated with obesity and varying components of metabolic syndrome including&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. With rising incidence of obesity in the&#xD;
      US, NAFLD and NASH are rapidly increasing with currently the second etiology for liver&#xD;
      transplantation in the US. The objectives of this protocol are to a) prospectively enroll&#xD;
      patients with NAFLD and NASH; b) randomize them to receiving text messaging to help manage&#xD;
      obesity and other components od metabolic syndrome in addition to standard clinical care or&#xD;
      receiving only standard clinical care; and c) follow up these patients at the end of 3 months&#xD;
      period for weight loss, blood pressure control, HBA1c, and liver enzymes. The immediate aim&#xD;
      of this protocol is to develop the pilot data on the usefulness of text messaging in the&#xD;
      management of NAFLD and NASH. The long-term goals of this research are to establish text&#xD;
      messaging as a beneficial intervention in the management of weight loss and control of risk&#xD;
      factors of NAFLD and improve outcomes of these patients with NAFLD and NASH.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be recruited primarily from the outpatient Liver Kirklin Clinic setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Informed consent will be obtained by one of the investigators named in the protocol or&#xD;
           by research coordinators involved with the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Eligibility will be confirmed by interview and review of medical records using the&#xD;
           inclusion and exclusion criteria as listed above.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Complete history and physical examination will be recorded especially for weight and&#xD;
           body mass index, associated components of metabolic syndrome (diabetes, hypertension,&#xD;
           and dyslipidemia), liver enzymes, and current medications list.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. All procedures such as imaging, endoscopy, and liver biopsy will be done as part of&#xD;
           standard routine care of these patients and no procedure will be done as part of this&#xD;
           research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Patients would be randomized to standard clinical care or to text messaging in addition&#xD;
           to standard clinical care. Standard clinical care includes obtaining data on history and&#xD;
           physical examination, routine blood work as part of liver disease care, ultrasound and&#xD;
           appropriate any other liver imaging as needed for patient care, counseling for at least&#xD;
           7-10% weight loss with discussion on strategies to achieve this, management of other&#xD;
           risk factors including diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia, and counseling for&#xD;
           compliance to taking medications and following up on future clinic visits. The study&#xD;
           investigator would be blinded to the randomization and which group the patient is&#xD;
           randomized to.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Patients would be followed at the end of 6 months period for assessing the study&#xD;
           outcomes as detailed earlier. Follow up for patients with stable liver disease is&#xD;
           usually done every 3-6 months. No additional clinic visits would be needed for this&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. During these 6 months, patients would receive standard text messages as detailed later.&#xD;
           Patients will use their own cell phone to receive the text messages and reply to these&#xD;
           messages. There will be no additional intervention or device needed for this study&#xD;
