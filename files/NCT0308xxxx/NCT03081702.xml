  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I/II study to find the highest dose of hydroxychloroquine that can be given&#xD;
      safely with itraconazole in patients with advanced platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian&#xD;
      cancer. The study will also determine the safety, tolerability, and initially determine&#xD;
      whether the combination is useful in the treatment of patients with advanced&#xD;
      platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian cancer.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Have clinically or radiographically documented measurable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All systemic therapy must have been completed 4 weeks or greater prior to enrollment&#xD;
             with radiologic evidence of radiological disease progression.&#xD;

             palliative radiation (for brain metastases) are eligible if they have been&#xD;
             asymptomatic for at least 2 weeks with use of maintenance steroid therapy, and last&#xD;
             received radiation at least 4 weeks prior to start of therapy.&#xD;

             other cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to itraconazole or hydroxychloroquine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known G6PD deficiency due to the risk of hemolytic anemia with the use of&#xD;
             hydroxychloroquine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known retinopathy due to the risk of worsening retinopathy with hydroxychloroquine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic or asymptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina&#xD;

             limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chronic Hepatitis B or hepatitis C infections should be excluded because of potential&#xD;
             effects on hepatic function and/ or drug interactions.&#xD;

          -  Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Already have a clinical indication for treatment with itraconazole (e.g. chronic&#xD;
