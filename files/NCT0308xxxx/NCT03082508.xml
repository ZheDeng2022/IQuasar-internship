  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      AUGMENT-HF II is a study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the Algisyl device. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to investigate Algisyl employed as a method of left ventricular&#xD;
      augmentation and restoration in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Algisyl will be injected into the myocardium under direct visualization during the surgical&#xD;
      procedure. Structural abnormalities in the heart are known to play a central role in HF, and&#xD;
      clinical evidence supports a strong causal relationship between cardiac chamber dilation and&#xD;
      heart failure. Because dilation, and not contractile dysfunction, appears to be responsible&#xD;
      for the severity of the disease, the mitigation or prevention of the deleterious structural&#xD;
      abnormalities of the left ventricle appears to be an important therapeutic target for&#xD;
      patients with this life threatening illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence, a therapy that specifically reduces LV wall stress, targets LV dilatation and LV&#xD;
      remodeling may offer an important new alternative in the treatment of heart failure. Algisyl&#xD;
      is being investigated based on evidence that suggests an ability of the implants to reduce&#xD;
      wall stress, reshape the LV chamber and reduce the LV chamber size as well as prevent the&#xD;
      progressive ventricular dilation and remodeling associated with HF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The physiologic response to progressive exercise using direct measures of ventilation and gas&#xD;
      exchange via the cardiopulmonary exercise test is an important diagnostic tool in the&#xD;
      management of the patient with HF, quantifying responses to therapy, and as a reliable&#xD;
      prognostic utility for predicting outcomes in patients with HF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numerous studies have established the strong association of peak VO2 with mortality and&#xD;
      morbidity risk in HF. Peak VO2 conceptually is considered an overall global marker of&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary health and is a reflection of the degree of impairment in ventricular&#xD;
      function ( the heart's pumping capacity), oxygen delivery and oxygen utilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence, employing the change in peak VO2 as a primary endpoint in this clinical study provides&#xD;
      a strong objective measure that can be interpreted in independent blinded fashion, to&#xD;
      evaluate the result of the therapeutic intervention and provide an equally strong assessment&#xD;
      of the prognostic implications for patients in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical evaluation is intended to provide confirmatory evidence of the effectiveness&#xD;
      and safety of the device Algisyl in patients with advanced heart failure.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The patients must be able and willing to give written informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The patients will be adult (age ≥ 18 years and ≤ 79 years) males or females&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The patients must be on stable, evidence-based therapy for heart failure&#xD;
&#xD;
             Evidence-based therapy for heart failure is defined as an ACE-inhibitor (ACE-I),&#xD;
             and/or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) for patients at stable doses for 1 month&#xD;
             prior to enrollment, if tolerated, and a beta blocker (carvedilol, metoprolol&#xD;
             succinate, Nebivolol or bisoprolol) for 3 months prior to enrollment, if tolerated.&#xD;
             Recent up-titration of the beta blocker is acceptable if the patient has been stable&#xD;
             on this dose for 1 month prior to enrollment. Stable is defined as no more than a 100%&#xD;
             increase or a 50% decrease in dose. Contraindications or intolerance to therapies&#xD;
             should be documented. In those intolerant to both ACE-I and ARB, combination therapy&#xD;
             with hydralazine and oral nitrate should be considered. Therapeutic equivalence for&#xD;
             ACE-I substitutions is allowed within the enrollment stability timelines. Aldosterone&#xD;
             inhibitor therapy should be added when NYHA Class III or IV symptoms occur on standard&#xD;
             therapy. If aldosterone inhibitor therapy is to be administered in NYHA Class II&#xD;
             patients, it must be initiated and optimized prior to enrollment. Eplerenone requires&#xD;
             dosage stability for 1 month prior to enrollment. Diuretics should be used as&#xD;
             necessary to keep the patient euvolemic. All heart failure therapeutics and dosages&#xD;
             should be documented in the Case Report Forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The patient must have cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) if clinically indicated,&#xD;
             implanted ≥3 months prior to randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
             * Note: In those patients not receiving CRT or CRT-D therapy the investigator should&#xD;
             not anticipate initiating this therapy within 6 months after randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The patient must have an implanted cardio-defibrillator (ICD) if clinically indicated,&#xD;
             implanted at least 30 days prior to randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
             *Note: If the patient has clinical indications for an ICD but refuses the ICD, this&#xD;
             refusal of ICD therapy must be document in the medical record and the patient may be&#xD;
             enrolled with this documentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The patients will have a left ventricular ejection fraction equal to or less than 35%&#xD;
             via echocardiography, cardiac catheterization, radionuclide scan, or magnetic&#xD;
             resonance imaging (measured within the last 30 days)&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. The patients will have a left ventricular end diastolic dimension indexed to body&#xD;
             surface area (LVEDDi) of greater than or equal to 30 mm/m2 (LVEDD/BSA) and an LVEDD of&#xD;
             greater than or equal to 85 mm (measured within the last 30 days)&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients must have symptomatic heart failure with a Peak VO2 of 9.0 - 15.0 ml/min/kg&#xD;
             (performed using a treadmill). Patients must perform two CPX tests (within 30 days of&#xD;
             randomization and performed at least 20 hours apart) that differ by no more than 15%&#xD;
             in the observed value for Peak VO2 and have a mean value of 9.0 - 15.0 ml/min/kg from&#xD;
             these two tests. All CPX tests performed for the study must have a Peak Respiratory&#xD;
             Exchange Ratio (RER) of at least 1.0 to be accepted as a valid test.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patient's surgical risk must be considered reasonable and the evaluation of surgical&#xD;
             risk should include review of coronary and left ventricular angiography. Surgical risk&#xD;
             assessment should include the consideration of risk presented by prior surgical&#xD;
             procedures such as prior mid-sternotomy surgical procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
             *Note: investigators should observe standard clinical practice for the management of&#xD;
             antithrombotic therapy in patients undergoing surgical procedures in accordance with&#xD;
             the American College of Chest Physicians Guidelines: Perioperative management of&#xD;
             antithrombotic therapy: Antithrombotic Therapy and Prevention of Thrombosis, 9th&#xD;
             edition&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. If female, the patients must be (a) post-menopausal, (b) surgically sterile, or (c)&#xD;
             using adequate birth control and have a negative serum pregnancy test within 7 days&#xD;
             prior to administration of study device&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients for whom it is planned to receive CABG, MVR, heart transplantation or LVAD&#xD;
             within the next 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients presenting with cardiogenic shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients presenting with a restrictive cardiomyopathy such as due to amyloidosis,&#xD;
