  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a single-center, comparative, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group,&#xD;
      active-controlled, clinical superiority trial of Fosravuconazole versus Itraconazole combined&#xD;
      with surgery in subjects with eumycetoma in Sudan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be three arms in this study: The first arm will be Fosravuconazole 300 mg weekly,&#xD;
      the second arm will have Fosravuconazole 200 mg weekly and the control arm is the standard&#xD;
      treatment using itraconazole 400mg daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 3 months time-point, interim analysis will be done and one of the study arms will be&#xD;
      dropped according to the drop-the-loser design, based on efficacy or toxicity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eumycetoma is a fungal disease caused by Madurella mycetomatis. The disease is chronic,&#xD;
      granulomatous and inflammatory. It usually involves subcutaneous tissues and leads to masses&#xD;
      and sinuses from which fungal grains are discharged. It is most probably introduced post&#xD;
      trauma e.g. thorn prick. It is associated with major morbidity and can be disabling,&#xD;
      disfiguring and highly stigmatizing. In advanced cases it may be fatal. Eumycetoma is most&#xD;
      prevalent in what is known as mycetoma belt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current treatment modalities for eumycetoma are disappointing. The response is characterized&#xD;
      by low cure rates, high amputation rates, high up drop out from follow up and high recurrence&#xD;
      rates. The available drugs for the treatment of eumycetoma are expensive, potentially toxic&#xD;
      and require a long treatment period up to 12 months. By that time the mass is well&#xD;
      encapsulated and is removed surgically. Despite prolonged medical treatment, the causative&#xD;
      organisms are commonly found to still be viable and can be cultured from the surgical&#xD;
      specimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this study are to determine the comparative efficacy, safety, and&#xD;
      tolerability of Fosravuconazole versus itraconazole as first-line treatment for subjects with&#xD;
      eumycetoma caused by Madurella mycetomatis. The primary end-point will be complete cure after&#xD;
      12 months treatment as evidenced by clinical assessment showing absence of mycetoma mass with&#xD;
      closure of sinuses and absent discharge, normal ultrasonic examination of the lesion, or the&#xD;
      presence of fibrosis only associated with a negative fungal culture from a surgical biopsy&#xD;
      from the former mycetoma site. The secondary endpoints are the outcome at 3-month's time&#xD;
      point based on the same criteria as 12 month and/or treatment-related adverse events at the&#xD;
      3- and 12-month visits. The study will also monitor plasma drug levels of ravuconazole and&#xD;
      itraconazole that will be included in a logistic model with other clinical and laboratory&#xD;
      parameters to predict outcome. In addition, immunological studies will be done to describe&#xD;
      the developing or changing immune responses during treatment. Lastly, all strains collected&#xD;
      will be cultured and typed and with assessment of antifungal resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a single-center, comparative, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group,&#xD;
      active-controlled, clinical superiority trial in subjects with eumycetoma requiring surgery.&#xD;
      There will be three arms this study: The first arm will have Fosravuconazole 300 mg weekly&#xD;
      and the second arm will have Fosravuconazole 200 mg weekly. Both arms will be evaluated at 3&#xD;
      months. At this time-point, one of the study arms will be dropped according to the&#xD;
      drop-the-loser design, based on efficacy or toxicity. The control arm is the standard&#xD;
      treatment using itraconazole 400mg daily. Patients will receive treatment for one year. An&#xD;
      interim analysis is planned after data has been accumulated for sample size of 28 for 3&#xD;
      months end point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be done at the Mycetoma Research Centre, Sudan when ethics and regulatory&#xD;
      approvals are received. The study plans to recruit 138 subjects by the end of the trial. The&#xD;
      main inclusion criteria are subjects who provide consent, aged 18 years or more with primary&#xD;
      moderate eumycetoma (size 2-10 cm) caused by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) confirmed&#xD;
      Madurella mycetomatis. Females in the child bearing age will require stringent contraception.&#xD;
      The main exclusion criteria are eumycetoma &gt; 10 cm, previous treatment, significant&#xD;
      concomitant illness that preclude evaluation and treatments or conditions treated with drugs&#xD;
      that are known to interact with the azoles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is expected to new safer and more efficacious eumycetoma treatment.&#xD;
