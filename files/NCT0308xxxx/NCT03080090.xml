  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of death and disability in the United States. Although&#xD;
      smoking has declined since 1964, it is still very common among some groups of people. One&#xD;
      such group is persons with emotional symptoms and disorders. There has been little success in&#xD;
      developing treatments for smoking cessation for smokers with affective disturbances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent work suggests that being sensitive to, and less tolerant of, stress is associated with&#xD;
      many problems in daily life. People with high 'stress sensitivity' tend to use avoidant&#xD;
      strategies to cope with their stress, like smoking. Also, people with high levels of stress&#xD;
      sensitivity report stronger beliefs that smoking will reduce negative feelings. They also&#xD;
      report having a harder time quitting and in fact, are less successful at doing so. This&#xD;
      information suggests that stress sensitivity is important to target during smoking cessation&#xD;
      treatment for smokers with affective vulnerabilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical trial will evaluate a treatment that integrates exercise to reduce stress&#xD;
      sensitivity among high stress sensitive smokers. It builds directly from our recent work and&#xD;
      we now seek to adapt it to a more a more accessible and sustainable application. Results will&#xD;
      provide important information on the benefit of an integrated intervention that could be used&#xD;
      in the community for smokers at great risk for relapse and who do not benefit from existing&#xD;
      alternative treatments. This study is the first to test an intervention for stress sensitive&#xD;
      smokers and has the potential to help at-risk individuals experience quitting success and,&#xD;
      ultimately, reduce the burden of tobacco-related cancers in Texas.&#xD;

      Experimental Group. Participants will select a YMCA branch and be assigned a personal fitness&#xD;
      instructor who will act as their case manager, overseeing the integrated exercise-based&#xD;
      intervention for smoking cessation. Guided by our pilot data showing efficacy and&#xD;
      tolerability of the exercise dose, the exercise intervention consists of 75 minutes/week of&#xD;
      aerobic training at vigorous-intensity for 15 weeks2. As in the previous study, the aerobic&#xD;
      training component will be completed on a treadmill and target training intensity will be&#xD;
      self-selected at 60% to 85% of age-predicted heart rate reserve (i.e., vigorous intensity) 2.&#xD;
      In order to maximize adherence, the days of the week and training progression schedule will&#xD;
      be individualized for each participant based on initial fitness level, travel, and any other&#xD;
      issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant and fitness instructor will meet for three sessions during the first week of&#xD;
      exercise training. During the first session, the fitness instructor will describe the program&#xD;
      (i.e., treatment model and aims), set a target quit attempt for week 6, develop an exercise&#xD;
      training schedule, and supervise the first exercise session to ensure the participant is&#xD;
      exercising properly. After two more supervised exercise sessions during the first week, the&#xD;
      pair will meet one day per week during the following 14 weeks of the study. The fitness&#xD;
      instructors will be responsible for monitoring sessions weekly, problem-solving any&#xD;
      difficulties, adjusting the aerobic and/or resistance training regimen as appropriate, and&#xD;
      entering the participants exercise data into the (REDCap) database specifically designed for&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the beginning of week 3, the fitness instructor will connect the participant with the&#xD;
      quitline (i.e., warm transfer). The Tobacco quitlines are now available in every U.S. state&#xD;
      via a national quitline portal, 1-800-QUIT-NOW, and have become the major vehicle through&#xD;
      which smoking cessation services are delivered in the U.S.73. All participants will receive&#xD;
      the standard telephone counseling package of up to 5 proactive calls from the Texas Tobacco&#xD;
      Quitline (https://www.quitnow.net/texas/); we will use a 'warm transfer' (i.e., call the&#xD;
      quitline in the presence of the smoker and put them on the phone for the intake interview).&#xD;
      Call 1 is an assessment and planning call, Call 2 is a pre-quit date call, Call 3 is a quit&#xD;
      date call, and Calls 4 and 5 are maintenance calls if the smoker has quit or problem solving&#xD;
      calls if they have not quit. Overall, the counseling protocol aims to (1) provide&#xD;
      cognitive-behavioral smoking cessation and relapse prevention tools, tailored to the&#xD;
      individual smoker's characteristics and; (2) provide medication management and advice&#xD;
      regarding nicotine patch use and adherence support, with the goal of completing a full course&#xD;
      of medication - in this case, 8 weeks of transdermal nicotine patch use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the target quit day, the fitness instructor will provide the participants with Nicoderm&#xD;
      CQÂ®, 24-hour transdermal nicotine patches (TNP) as part of the study. We chose to provide the&#xD;
      patch for 8 weeks because longer than 8 weeks does not appear to improve treatment&#xD;
      efficacy10. We chose the TNP because of the extensive empirical literature supporting its&#xD;
      effectiveness and safety, its ease of use, and its relatively benign side effect profile that&#xD;
      have led to its approval as an over-the-counter medication74. Quitline staff provide&#xD;
      instructions on dose and tapering schedule in a fashion consistent with that used in previous&#xD;
      trials with a similar formulation of the patch10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Group. The intervention procedures for this group are identical to the Experimental&#xD;
      Group group except that the target training intensity will be self-selected at 20% to 40% of&#xD;
      age-predicted heart rate reserve (i.e., light intensity).&#xD;
