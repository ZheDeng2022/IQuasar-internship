    <textblock>
      To compare the physiologic benefits of rejuvenated RBCs (rejRBCs) to standards RBCs (PRBCs),&#xD;
      we will emulate critical conditions by safely maximizing stress on the cardiovascular system,&#xD;
      in an elective, feasible volunteer study. Maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) will be measured in&#xD;
      an anemic, post-donation, pre-transfusion state, and also after transfusing 14-day-old,&#xD;
      autologous blood randomized to standard storage or standard storage with rejuvenation. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that transfusion of standard PRBCs is less effective at increasing oxygen&#xD;
      delivery (measured by VO2max) compared with transfusion of rejRBCs.&#xD;

      VISIT A ( - Screening) Written informed consent will be obtained from subjects who respond to&#xD;
      an IRB-approved advertisement/flyer and fulfill eligibility requirements. The following video&#xD;
      will help explain the study: vimeo.com/167291799. Individuals who respond to an IRB approved&#xD;
      advertisement/flyer (uploaded to eIRB) will be given information about the study and asked to&#xD;
      read an IRB approved consent form. An investigator or designee will obtain written informed&#xD;
      consent from each individual participating in this study, after adequate explanation of the&#xD;
      methods, objectives, and potential hazards of the study. The investigator or designee will&#xD;
      also explain to the subjects that they are completely free to refuse to enter the study and&#xD;
      free to withdraw from it at any time. A copy of the signed consent form will be given to the&#xD;
      subject and will be shared with The Blood Connection to ensure proper labeling of autologous&#xD;
      units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After subjects have provided written informed consent, they will be asked to answer several&#xD;
      questions in 2 written questionnaires (uploaded to eIRB) in order to confirm that they are&#xD;
      eligible to donate blood. These questions are similar to those routinely asked to people&#xD;
      prior to a blood donation. These are focused upon keeping the risks of blood donation to the&#xD;
      lowest possible level. Subject will undergo screening lab tests for baseline hemoglobin,&#xD;
      sickle cell trait, serum pregnancy tests only for women of child-bearing potential, ECG,&#xD;
      exercise test. Subject will receive a phone confirmation from the investigator or delegated&#xD;
      research staff after review of the screening lab results. Subject will bring a copy of the&#xD;
      signed consent form to The Blood Connection if qualified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VISIT B (Day 0 - Blood donation) The Blood Connection (TBC), Raleigh, NC, is registered and&#xD;
      licensed by the US FDA and accredited by the American Association of Blood Banks (AABB) to&#xD;
      manufacture RBCs and other blood products. Two units of blood will be withdrawn from each&#xD;
      subject according to standards for double, AS-3, apheresis units, and will be marked for&#xD;
      autologous donation, and purchased by Duke Transfusion Services, as arranged with the medical&#xD;
      director of TBC (Robert Rainer, MD). RBC handling and storage will meet FDA and AABB&#xD;
      standards; units will be stored with Duke Transfusion Services c/o Dr. Poisson.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VISIT C (Day 14 - &quot;Anemic&quot; VO2 max, Transfusion (Tx) and &quot;post-Tx&quot; VO2max)) Small amount of&#xD;
      blood [3 lavender topped tubes] will be collected from subject to test for hemoglobin, type &amp;&#xD;
      screen and 1 cross match to verify the donated blood received from The Blood Connection&#xD;
      belongs to the same subject who arrives at the appointed date at Duke facility&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anemic VO2max Three minutes of resting baseline measures will be recorded before the start of&#xD;
      exercise. The subject will then begin to pedal the cycle ergometer at a cadence of 75 rpm.&#xD;
      Resistance will be manually set according to a standardized, progressive protocol. A rating&#xD;
      of perceived exertion (RPE) will be obtained at the end of each exercise stage. Vital signs&#xD;
      will be recorded every 3 minutes, and ECG monitoring will be continuous. Exercise will be&#xD;
      terminated when the subject reaches volitional fatigue. VO2max will be reported as the&#xD;
      highest oxygen consumption averaged over two 30-second periods, which typically occurs in the&#xD;
      last stage of the progressive maximal exercise test. Maximum heart rate will be the heart&#xD;
      rate at or near VO2max. To minimize variability in VO2max testing procedures, the same 2&#xD;
      facilitators (an engineer/technician and a research staff) will be present at every test.&#xD;
      Radial arterial access will be obtained for cardiac output monitoring (LiDCO pulse contour&#xD;
      analysis) at this visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tx and post-Tx VO2max Duke Transfusion Services will randomize each subject to receive 2&#xD;
      units of standard PRBCs or rejRBCs over 120 minutes using a standard infusion pump. All units&#xD;
      will be washed to equalize the transfusion volumes; rejuvenation includes a mandatory washing&#xD;
      step. Rejuvenation of donated blood will be done according to the procedures in the labeling&#xD;
      of the Rejuvesol product. Vital signs will be monitored and recorded every 15 minutes. After&#xD;
      a total 4-hour rest after completing the first VO2max testing, and a light snack, the&#xD;
      exercise test will be repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory testing: The p50 will be measured in one of the blood units transfused and in the&#xD;
      subject before the exercise test. Radial arterial access will be obtained for serial cardiac&#xD;
      output monitoring (LiDCO Pulse Contour Analysis, LiDCO Products, London, UK), arterial blood&#xD;
      gas analysis and lactate measurement before and after transfusion, and after exercise&#xD;
      testing. Final blood collected for a hemoglobin level will be done at the conclusion of blood&#xD;
      transfusion. This is the final visit and participation is completed.&#xD;

    <description>Rejuvenation refers to the process of adding a mix of solutes (Rejuvesol®, Citra Labs, Braintree, MA; consists of sodium pyruvate, inosine, adenine, mono- and dibasic sodium phosphate) to older, stored (i.e., 2-3 DPG-depleted) blood to immediately restore 2,3-DPG and ATP levels in the stored red blood cells15. Rejuvenation was originally developed to prolong the storage life of rare-phenotype RBC units. It is FDA-approved for use in RBC units stored in CPD, CPDA-1, and AS-1. The major contraindication for the use of Rejuvesol® is in RBC units stored for fewer than 6 days due to high baseline 2,3-DPG and ATP levels. Rejuvenated units must be washed prior to administration to remove residual Rejuvesol that is not approved for iv administration in such concentrations.</description>

Transfusion of rejuvenated and washed autolgous RBCs: Rejuvenation refers to the process of adding a mix of solutes (Rejuvesol®, Citra Labs, Braintree, MA; consists of sodium pyruvate, inosine, adenine, mono- and dibasic sodium phosphate) to older, stored (i.e., 2-3 DPG-depleted) blood to immediately restore 2,3-DPG and ATP levels in the stored red blood cells15. Rejuvenation was originally developed to prolong the storage life of rare-phenotype RBC units. It is FDA-approved for use in RBC units stored in CPD, CPDA-1, and AS-1. The major contraindication for the use of Rejuvesol® is in RBC units stored for fewer than 6 days due to high baseline 2,3-DPG and ATP levels. Rejuvenated units must be washed prior to administration to remove residual Rejuvesol that is not approved for iv administration in such concentrations.</description>

          <description>Washed and Rejuvenated autologous blood&#xD;
Transfusion of rejuvenated and washed autolgous RBCs: Rejuvenation refers to the process of adding a mix of solutes (Rejuvesol®, Citra Labs, Braintree, MA; consists of sodium pyruvate, inosine, adenine, mono- and dibasic sodium phosphate) to older, stored (i.e., 2-3 DPG-depleted) blood to immediately restore 2,3-DPG and ATP levels in the stored red blood cells15. Rejuvenation was originally developed to prolong the storage life of rare-phenotype RBC units. It is FDA-approved for use in RBC units stored in CPD, CPDA-1, and AS-1. The major contraindication for the use of Rejuvesol® is in RBC units stored for fewer than 6 days due to high baseline 2,3-DPG and ATP levels. Rejuvenated units must be washed prior to administration to remove residual Rejuvesol that is not approved for iv administration in such concentrations.</description>

Transfusion of washed autolgous RBCs: Autologous RBCs will be washed prior to transfusion to maintain blinding and equalize volume and Hct with the rejuvenated and washed intervention arm</description>
