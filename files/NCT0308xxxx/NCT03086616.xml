    <description>Safety of repeated CED of nal-IRI following standard of care focal radiotherapy will be assessed by monitoring for adverse events, scheduled laboratory assessments, vital sign measurements, and physical examinations for subjects who receive the vaccination. The severity of toxicities will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE v4.0. Adverse events and clinically significant laboratory abnormalities (meeting Grade 3, 4, or 5 criteria according to CTCAE) will be summarized by maximum intensity and relationship to study drug(s). Grade 1 and 2 adverse events will be summarized if related to study therapy. Descriptive statistics will be utilized to display the data on toxicity</description>

    <description>Any eligible subject treated on the dose level that will be investigated within the expansion cohort will be considered evaluable for clinical efficacy. Analyses will be performed after all enrolled patients have completed 12 months, or whenever the status of all patients has been established, whichever comes first. The primary analysis will be based on the Kaplan-Meier method. Kaplan-Meier estimates and the associated 95% confidence intervals (CI) will be calculated</description>
