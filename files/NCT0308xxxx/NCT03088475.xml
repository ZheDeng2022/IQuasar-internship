      Aim. To develop and compare a nurse-led smartphone-based self-management programme with an&#xD;
      existing nurse-led diabetes service on health-related outcomes of type 2 diabetes patients&#xD;
      with poor glycaemic control in Singapore.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background. Over the past decades, Asia has emerged as the 'diabetes epicentre' in the world&#xD;
      due to rapid economic development, urbanisation, and nutrition transition. There is an urgent&#xD;
      need to develop more effective care management strategies in response to this rising diabetes&#xD;
      epidemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design. A randomised controlled trial with pre- and repeated post-tests control group design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology. A total of 128 type 2 diabetes patients with poor glycaemic control will be&#xD;
      recruited from the diabetes clinic of a public acute hospital in Singapore through&#xD;
      convenience sampling. Study participants will be randomly allocated either to the&#xD;
      experimental group or the control group. Outcome measures will include the 10-item General&#xD;
      Self-Efficacy Scale, 11-item Revised Summary of Diabetes Self-care Activities, and 19-item&#xD;
      Diabetes-Dependent Quality of Life. Data will be collected at three time points: baseline, 3&#xD;
      months, and 6 months from the baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion. It is expected that this programme will be an alternative offered to diabetes&#xD;
      patients to master their self-care management skills, in addition to the existing diabetes&#xD;
      service provided in diabetes clinics in Singapore hospitals. Furthermore, the self-supporting&#xD;
      and less resource-intensive nature of this programme, through the use of a smartphone&#xD;
      application as the mode of intervention delivery, will greatly reduce nurses' direct contact&#xD;
      time with patients and allow more time to be allocated to those who require more attention.&#xD;

      Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to develop a nurse-led smartphone-based self-management programme (NSSMP) for patients&#xD;
           with type 2 diabetes;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to compare the NSSMP with an existing nurse-led diabetes service (NDS) on self-efficacy,&#xD;
           diabetes self-care activities, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), glycaemic&#xD;
           control, acute diabetes complications (e.g. hypoglycaemia, Diabetic Ketoacidosis [DKA]&#xD;
           and Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic Syndrome [HHS]), and health-service use among type 2&#xD;
           diabetes patients with poor glycemic control in Singapore.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be randomized into an existing NDS group (i.e. control group) and a&#xD;
      newly developed NSSMP group (i.e. experimental group). It is hypothesized that participants&#xD;
      in the NSSMP group as compared with participants in the NDS group will have significantly:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Higher level of self-efficacy;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Increased level of diabetes self-care activities;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. More positive perceived health-related quality of life;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Reduced glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and acute diabetes complications (e.g.&#xD;
           hypoglycaemia, Diabetic Ketoacidosis [DKA] and Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic Syndrome [HHS]&#xD;
           ); and&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Reduced usage of health services (e.g. diabetes-related hospital readmission, emergency&#xD;
           room attendance, and unplanned medical consultation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approach Adopted in This Study Development of NSSMP: A nurse-led smartphone-based&#xD;
      self-management programme, or NSSMP for short, will be developed by the study team. The model&#xD;
      of self-efficacy will be used to guide the development of the NSSMP to ensure it would be&#xD;
      theoretically sound and empirically tested. The NSSMP is a 6-month programme comprising an&#xD;
      individual education session, and a newly developed smartphone App as a self-help education&#xD;
      resource. The NSSMP involves the use of a smartphone, internet, and communication&#xD;
      technologies to assist patients to manage their disease at homes or wherever they are.&#xD;
      Patient's health data will be monitored by their smartphones. All the data will be&#xD;
      synchronized to a web-connected portal on a remote server. The nurse would be able to access&#xD;
      the participant's data (e.g. blood glucose, exercise, blood pressure, body weight, diet)&#xD;
      through the web-connected portal so that the individualized care and consultation could be&#xD;
      rendered through the tele or video conference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design, setting and participants: A randomized controlled trial with a pre- and&#xD;
      repeated post-test control group design is adopted. A convenience sample of 128 type 2 DM&#xD;
      patients with poor glycemic control will be recruited from the Diabetes Clinic of National&#xD;
      University Hospital (NUH). Study participants will be randomly assigned either to a 6-month&#xD;
      NSSMP group (i.e experimental group) or the NDS group (i.e. control group). The existing NDS&#xD;
      for DM patients in the NUH consists of face-to-face patient education sessions plus telephone&#xD;
      follow-ups. The patients are required to return back to the Diabetes Clinic to attend the&#xD;
      educations sessions based on the scheduled appointment. They are instructed to measure blood&#xD;
      glucose at home and modes of contact (voicemail, fax and email address) are given for&#xD;
      reporting the glucose readings weekly. If the patient does not report, the nurse will have to&#xD;
      make calls or send SMS message to the patient to follow up their blood glucose results. The&#xD;
      nurses would then provide telephone counselling services to the patients where needed based&#xD;
      on the blood glucose results, and sometime would request patients coming back to the Diabetes&#xD;
      Clinic to see the doctors and the diabetes advanced practice nurses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: Study outcome measures include the 10-item General Self-Efficacy Scale,&#xD;
      11-item Revised Summary of Diabetes Self-care Activities, and 19-item Diabetes-Dependent&#xD;
      Quality of Life which will be used to measure self-efficacy, level of diabetes self-care&#xD;
      activities, and health-related quality of life of the participants respectively. The&#xD;
      participant's socio-demographic and clinical data (e.g. HbA1c, acute diabetes complications,&#xD;
      and lipid level) will be also collected. Data will be collected at 3 time points: baseline&#xD;
      (i.e. pre-test), 3 months from baseline (post-test 1), and 6 months from the baseline&#xD;
      (post-test 2). The health service use (e.g. diabetes-related hospital readmission, emergency&#xD;
      room attendance, and unplanned medical consultation) will be also assessed at the 6th month&#xD;
      of the end of the programme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis: The IBM SPSS 23.0 will be used for data entry and analysis. Intention-to-treat&#xD;
      will be adopted in data analysis. Repeated measures analysis of covariance will be used to&#xD;
      examine the differences between, within, and the interaction (group x time) effects on each&#xD;
      continuous outcome. Confounding variables (e.g. age), will be controlled as covariate in the&#xD;
      analysis. The Chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test will be used to test the difference of&#xD;
      the incidence of acute diabetes complications and the numbers of health service use between&#xD;
      the two groups. All statistical tests will be two-tailed, and a p &lt; 0.05 is used to indicate&#xD;
      statistical significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Significance If the NSSMP is demonstrated to be effective in this study, a smartphone&#xD;
      App developed in this project can be provided to all DM patients and their family&#xD;
      members/caregivers as a self-help education resource at home. It will provide and equip&#xD;
      knowledge to the patient and their family members/caregivers to enhance their knowledge and&#xD;
      skills in management of diabetes so as to achieve the expected patient outcomes in improving&#xD;
      self-efficacy, diabetes self-care activities, HRQoL, and clinical outcomes. It is expected&#xD;
      that this programme will be an option that can be offered to diabetes patients to master&#xD;
      their self-care management skills in addition to the existing diabetes service provided in&#xD;
      diabetes clinics in Singapore hospitals where patients with poorly controlled condition are&#xD;
      being monitored. In addition, the independent nature of this programme with application of&#xD;
      technology will greatly reduce nurses' contact time with patients which accord them more time&#xD;
      for those who require more time, for example, those afflicted with diabetes-related&#xD;
      complications. This will result in a more efficient use of healthcare resources in the long&#xD;
      run. Eventually, this programme will be available for all diabetes patients living in the&#xD;
      community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility of the Study The research team comprises experienced researchers from different&#xD;
      disciplines. The PI has extensive research experience in the area of chronic diseases&#xD;
      management and mHealth intervention. Two Co-Is are practised clinicians in diabetes care,&#xD;
      they will facilitate the access to potential study participants and oversee the&#xD;
      implementation of the project. One Co-I has the expertise in biomedical engineering, mobile&#xD;
      App development, and information management. He and his team will be in charge of developing&#xD;
      the system. In addition, the preliminary integrative literature review and qualitative&#xD;
      patient interviews were performed to inform the development of the content for the mobile&#xD;
      app. Through harnessing the technology, the smartphone App based platform can be established&#xD;
      to reduce the contact time with patients for the healthcare providers.&#xD;
