    <textblock>
      Burden: According to Bangladesh Demographic Health Survey 2014, prevalence of stunting in&#xD;
      under-five children is 36%. Severe acute malnutrition (SAM) is prevalent in about 3% of them.&#xD;
      In absolute numbers, about 450,000 children suffer from SAM while several million children&#xD;
      suffer from moderate acute malnutrition (MAM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowledge gap: Investigators have already demonstrated that children with SAM have immature&#xD;
      gut microbiota that is partially corrected with treatment. Through our earlier studies&#xD;
      conducted in Bangladesh,investigators now also have idea about beneficial microbiota and food&#xD;
      ingredients that support proliferation of these beneficial microbiota. Which composite food&#xD;
      is better for children with SAM and MAM is not known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis (if any): The central hypothesis of our ongoing Breast Milk, Gut Microbiome and&#xD;
      Immunity (BMMI) initiative proof of concept phase is that healthy growth in infancy and early&#xD;
      childhood requires normal functional maturation of the gut microbiota. Related hypotheses are&#xD;
      that (i) persistent defects in the development of this microbial 'organ' are causally related&#xD;
      to stunting as well as the metabolic, immunologic and cognitive manifestations of&#xD;
      undernutrition; and (ii) new approaches for durable repair of this microbiota immaturity&#xD;
      including Microbiota-Directed Complementary Foods (MDCF) will provide a way to improve&#xD;
      clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Test 5 MDCF prototypes and nominate a lead MDCF formulation that has the greatest effect&#xD;
           in promoting the representation of a broad range of age-discriminatory taxa and that has&#xD;
           acceptable organoleptic properties. This nominated lead will be advanced to a fully&#xD;
           powered clinical POC study in children with post-SAM MAM in 2018.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine whether once daily administration is as effective as twice daily&#xD;
           administration of the lead MDCF in repairing microbiota immaturity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assess the durability of repair of immaturity by the lead MDCF by including a 4 week&#xD;
           post-intervention phase in the final pre-POC study design.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Determine what effect enteropathogen burden (determined by PCR-based analysis of fecal&#xD;
           samples) has on responses of age-discriminatory taxa to MDCFs, and reciprocally, the&#xD;
           effect of MDCFs on enteropathogen burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will conduct 3 Pre-POC studies in 12-18 month old children with MAM&#xD;
      (Weight-for-Length Z-score, WLZ: between &lt;-2 to -3) and stunting (Length-for-Age Z-score,&#xD;
      LAZ: between &lt;-2 to -3) over the course of approximately two years. The investigators will&#xD;
      use a stratified randomization procedure based on age (i.e.2 levels: 12-15 months and &gt;15-18&#xD;
      months) to prevent imbalance between the treatment arms. This study will be undertaken at&#xD;
      Mirpur area of Dhaka city. The investigators will design and produce 5 MDCF prototypes at the&#xD;
      icddr,b Food Processing Laboratory in sufficient quantities for clinical studies (3 MDCF&#xD;
      prototypes for study 1 and 2 MDCF prototypes for study 2). These formulations will be matched&#xD;
      in energy density and micronutrient content of ready-to-use supplementary foods (RUSFs) used&#xD;
      for MAM in Bangladesh and other countries, and will meet all other requirements for a&#xD;
      complementary/supplementary food for 12-18 month old children with MAM and stunting.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Investigators will conduct 3 Pre-POC studies among 12-18 month old children with MAM (WLZ &lt;-2&#xD;
      to -3) and stunting (LAZ &lt;-2 to -3) over the course of approximately two years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Randomized controlled intervention trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study site: This study will be conducted at Bauniabadh, Mirpur in Dhaka city, which is a&#xD;
      peri-urban slum area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants: The study participants will be 12-18 months old children of either sex&#xD;
      with MAM (WLZ: &lt;-2 to -3) and stunting (LAZ: &lt;-2 to -3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial screening and enrolment: Children will be screened and enrolled by household survey&#xD;
      in section 11 of Mirpur by Field Research Assistants (FRAs) following pre-specified inclusion&#xD;
      criteria. Fulfilling the enrolment criteria and upon receiving the consent for study&#xD;
      participation from the parents or legal guardians, the children with the respective&#xD;
      mother/caregiver will be enrolled and randomly assigned to one of the four arms according to&#xD;
      computer-generated random numbers using permuted blocks of varied lengths of four and twelve&#xD;
      for study 1. Similarly, children and mother/caregiver will be enrolled and randomly assigned&#xD;
      to one of the three arms according to computer-generated random numbers using permuted blocks&#xD;
      of block lengths of three and nine for study 2 and 3 respectively. The code of assigned type&#xD;
      of MDCFs will be kept in closed opaque envelopes until assigned to an enrolled child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feeding sessions: The children and mothers/caregivers will be requested to come to the&#xD;
      nutrition centre established in the community at Mirpur preferably between 9 to 11 am and 3-5&#xD;
      pm on day 1. The mothers will be requested not to give/allow any food and breast milk in the&#xD;
      preceding 2 hours of observed meal time on the day of observed feeding. On the same day at&#xD;
      the nutrition centre, the child will be offered 25 grams (in two meals preferably between&#xD;
      9-11 am and 3-5 pm) of MDCFs as decided by random allocation. During the feeding time, the&#xD;
      mothers will be asked to spoon feed the respective pre-weighed diets to their children until&#xD;
      s/he refuses to eat further, as described below. After a two-minute pause, the same diet will&#xD;
      be offered a second time until s/he refuses again. After a second two-minute pause, the diet&#xD;
      will be offered a third time until refused again. After this third refusal, the feeding&#xD;
      episode will be considered as 'terminated'.7 The duration of the feeding (excluding the&#xD;
      intervening 'rest periods') will be recorded by stopwatch, and the total duration of the&#xD;
      feeding will be noted. If the child demands more after finishing all the food, she/he will be&#xD;
      offered the amount that was offered at the beginning. This feeding episode will last for&#xD;
      maximum 60 minutes. Measured volumes of plain water will also be given and the amount of&#xD;
      water taken during this 60 minutes meal period will be measured. The feeding episode will&#xD;
      take place under the direct supervision of trained study personnel. Children will be&#xD;
      considered as refusing further intake if they move their head away from the food, cry, clamp&#xD;
      the mouth or clinch the teeth, or become agitated, spit out the food or refuse to swallow.8&#xD;
      The amount of MDCF actually ingested will be calculated by subtracting the left over from the&#xD;
      offered amount. Pre-weighed napkins will be provided; any food that is regurgitated, vomited&#xD;
      or spilled will be swabbed, weighed and subtracted from the amount offered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acceptability will be categorized as 'accepted eagerly' if they ate food readily, did not&#xD;
      make any fuss, spit out, vomit or cry during the observed meal. Children will be categorized&#xD;
      as 'accepted but not eagerly' if they ate the offered food but either made fuss, spit out,&#xD;
      vomited or cried during the observed meal. The third category will be children who will not&#xD;
      consume the offered food at all.9&#xD;
&#xD;
      The amount of consumed food (g), energy (kcal) and category of acceptability will be&#xD;
      analyzed. The enrolled children will be monitored by daily home visits by trained Field Field&#xD;
      Research Assistants for any possible side effects/adverse events (e.g. rash, urticaria due to&#xD;
      food allergy or any significant changes in clinical status) for a week. If any side&#xD;
      effects/adverse events are observed then they will be treated according to the standard&#xD;
      management provided at Dhaka Hospital of icddr,b. Perception and assessment of organoleptic&#xD;
      characteristics of the assigned MDCFs by the respective mother/caregiver will also be&#xD;
      assessed by using the 7-point Hedonic scale. Higher value, that is 7, will be ranked as 'like&#xD;
      extremely' and lowest value 1 will be ranked as 'dislike extremely'.10&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the beginning of the study, information will be sought on the demographic characteristics&#xD;
      (families' wealth, standard of housing, family structure and parental characteristics etc.),&#xD;
      and trained FRAs will record the children's nude weight using a digital scale with 2 g&#xD;
      precision (Seca, model 728, Germany), length (using infantometer, Seca, model 416, Germany),&#xD;
      and mid upper-arm circumference to the nearest mm (using a non-stretch insertion tape).&#xD;
      Anthropometrics will be done according to the standard procedures and all measurements will&#xD;
      be taken thrice and the middle one will be recorded. All interventions in each study will be&#xD;
      administered to children at the Mirpur health clinic. Mothers/primary caregivers will be be&#xD;
      advised to maintain their child's current dietary and breastfeeding practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-POC Studies 1 and 2 will each be 8 weeks in duration and have 4 and 3 arms respectively,&#xD;
      with 12-15 children enrolled per arm with a minimum of 10 children per arm completing the&#xD;
      study. There will be a 2 week run-in period to define pre-treatment MAZ, and additionally,&#xD;
      enteropathogen burden will be assessed by PCR-based measurement of a broad range of&#xD;
      gastrointestinal pathogens in the same fecal specimens used to calculate MAZ scores (these&#xD;
      will not be used as screening tools for subsequent treatment). Children will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to one of the three arms. Efforts will be made to balance arms with respect to&#xD;
      gender and stratify the randomization on age (e.g. 2 levels; 12-15 months and &gt;15-18 months).&#xD;
      The treatment phase will be for 4-weeks, during which time each test product will be&#xD;
      administered at the test center twice daily, separated by at least 6 hours. There will be a&#xD;
      2-week post intervention phase in which 2 additional fecal samples samples will be collected&#xD;
      (at the end of weeks 7 and 8) to assess changes in the microbiota that occur after cessation&#xD;
      of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-POC Study 3 will have 3 arms. It will test the lead MDCF identified in study 2 and&#xD;
      benchmark its efficacy at repairing microbiota immaturity compared to the current RUSF&#xD;
      standard of care over a 4 week intervention period. We will examine the impact of 1x vs 2x&#xD;
      per day dosing of the lead MDCF on efficacy in this study and also include a 4-week&#xD;
      post-intervention period (with fecal sampling at the end of weeks 7, 8, 9 and 10) to assess&#xD;
      the durability of changes in microbiota maturity after cessation of intervention and return&#xD;
      to home diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fecal sample collection Weekly fecal samples (1-2g) will be collected within 30 minutes of&#xD;
      production (at home and transported back to the icddr,b) using the N2 dry shipper specimen&#xD;
      collection SOP used in the recent study of local RUTFs for the treatment of SAM (see Appendix&#xD;
      A). Specimens will be stored at -80◦C before being sent to the Gordon Lab at the end of each&#xD;
      study for rapid analysis of microbiota maturity (measured before, during and after cessation&#xD;
      of treatment with each MDCF prototype) and PCR-based assessment of enteropathogen burden in&#xD;
      fecal samples (measured before and after MDCF treatment). The relative abundance of each of&#xD;
      the bacterial strains that were specifically targeted by the next generation MDCF will be&#xD;
      determined through analysis of the 16S rRNA datasets (performed in the Gordon Lab and funded&#xD;
      by the primary BMMI Project POC Phase grant)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proposed Pre-POC Studies&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 1: Test 3 prototype MDCFs and the current rice-lentil RUSF standard of care for MAM to&#xD;
      establish the effect size of each on MAZ repair in a 4 week 2x /day intervention, with a 2&#xD;
      week post-intervention phase to assess durability of MDCF-induced changes in the microbiota:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 1 - Current RUSF used for MAM, administered 2x /day for 4 weeks Arm 2 - Prototype MDCF1,&#xD;
      administered 2x /day for 4 weeks Arm 3 - Prototype MDCF2, administered 2x /day for 4 weeks&#xD;
      Arm 4 - Prototype MDCF3, administered 2x /day for 4 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 1 - Rice-lentil based RUSF (rationale: reference standard of care for MAM; not designed&#xD;
      based on knowledge of its effects on the gut microbiota or microbiota immaturity).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 2 - MDCF prototype with four complementary food ingredients plus powdered milk&#xD;
      (rationale: lead with evidence from preclinical gnotobiotic models of repair of microbiota&#xD;
      immaturity and positive effects on growth).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 3 - MDCF prototype with four complementary food ingredients without powdered milk&#xD;
      (rationale: determine whether withdrawal of milk impacts the effects of the four&#xD;
      complementary food ingredient combinations on the microbiota and host biomarkers).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 4 - MDCF prototype with two complementary food ingredients (chickpea and soy flour)&#xD;
      without powdered milk (rationale: compare the efficacy of this formulation to that of the&#xD;
      MDCF formulation containing four complementary food ingredients which is administered to&#xD;
      group 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fecal sample collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fecal samples will be collected from each child at enrollment, 1 week after enrollment, at&#xD;
      randomization (2 weeks) and weekly during the intervention and post-intervention phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Assuming 15 study participants / arm and 4 arms, a total of 540 fecal specimens will be&#xD;
      collected in Study1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood sample collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      2 mL of blood samples each will be collected from every child prior to intervention and just&#xD;
      after the intervention is complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Assuming 15 study participants /arms, a total of 120 blood samples will be collected in&#xD;
      Study1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 2: Select most efficacious MDCF from study 1 and compare with 2 additional MDCF&#xD;
      prototypes using the same design used in study 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 1 - 'Winner' from study 2 administered 2x /day for 4 weeks Arm 2 - Prototype MDCF4&#xD;
      administered 2x /day for 4 weeks Arm 3 - Prototype MDCF5 administered 2x /day for 4 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fecal sample collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fecal samples will be collected from each child at enrollment, 1 week after enrollment, at&#xD;
      randomization (2 weeks) and weekly during the intervention and post-intervention phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Assuming 15 study participants / arm and 3 arms, a total of 405 fecal specimens will be&#xD;
      collected in Study 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood sample collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      2 mL of blood samples each will be collected from every child prior to intervention and just&#xD;
      after the intervention is complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - 15 study participants /arms, a total of 90 blood samples will be collected in Study 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 3:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Select lead MDCF from studies 1, 2 and conduct final 'bake-off' vs current RUSF and also&#xD;
      examine the impact of 1x vs 2x per day administration with a 4 week post-intervention period&#xD;
      to provide additional information on the durability of MDCF-sponsored changes in the&#xD;
      microbiota:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 1 - Current RUSF used for MAM 2x /day for 4 weeks followed by a 4 week&#xD;
      post-interventional phase Arm 2 - Lead MDCF identified in study 2, 2x /day for 4 weeks&#xD;
      followed by a 4 week post-interventional phase Arm 3 - Lead MDCF identified in study 2, 1x&#xD;
      /day for 4 weeks followed by a 4 week post-interventional phase&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fecal sample collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feces would be collected weekly from each study participant during the course of the 8-week&#xD;
      study including the 2 weeks prior to treatment, the four weeks during treatment and the two&#xD;
      weeks following cessation of treatment (11 samples/ child).&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Assuming 15 study participants / arm and 3 arms, a total of 495 fecal specimens will be&#xD;
      collected in Study 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assuming a 8-week study duration (studies 1 and 2) and 8 weeks for shipping of fecal&#xD;
      specimens to Washington University, extraction of DNA, PCR amplification of the V4 region of&#xD;
      the bacterial 16S rRNA genes, sequencing of these amplicons and data analysis, each study&#xD;
      cycle from completion of enrollment to completion of data analysis is anticipated to be 16&#xD;
      weeks. With this cycle time, we anticipate being able to evaluate candidate MDCFs by the end&#xD;
      of June 2017 and complete all 5 by the end of April 2018, at which point a lead MDCF will be&#xD;
      nominated for the POC study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information gathered will be used to select human fecal samples for transplantation into&#xD;
      germ-free animals; these animals, who will be fed the diets of their human microbiota donors,&#xD;
      will be used to further characterize the mechanisms that link MDCF prototypes, the gut&#xD;
      microbiota, and host physiology/metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Targeted Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (UPLC-MS) and Gas&#xD;
      Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) will be used to profile analytes of specific&#xD;
      interest in plasma and/or fecal samples including bile acids and short chain fatty acids&#xD;
      (SCFAs); markers of mitochondrial function (e.g., β-hydroxybutyrate, acylcarnitines/acylCoAs,&#xD;
      TCA cycle intermediates); amino acids in fecal samples [branch chain amino acids, tryptophan&#xD;
      and tryptophan metabolites related to growth and inflammatory status, including those&#xD;
      produced by bacterial tryptophan metabolism (e.g. indole acetic acid derivatives)].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood sample collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      2 mL of blood samples each will be collected from every child prior to intervention and just&#xD;
      after the intervention is complete.15 study participants / arm and 3 arms, a total of 90&#xD;
      blood samples will be collected in Study 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to construct a library of gut microbiota of healthy growing children of the same&#xD;
      community, one spot fecal sample (1-2 gm) and spot blood sample (2 mL) will be collected from&#xD;
      30 children each who would be aged 12-18 months of either sex, having WLZ and LAZ : &gt;-1. This&#xD;
      will be done only after obtaining consent from the study participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through our initial lab work as well as earlier studies done on gnotobiotic animals in&#xD;
      Washington University Centre for Genome Science has led us to suggest that a combination of&#xD;
      food ingredients (chickpea, soy flour, peanut and green banana) with or without milk powder&#xD;
      will be worth studying with respect to the diet's impact on stimulating proliferation of&#xD;
      growth-discriminatory microbiota as well as cost and sustainability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be asked to come to the designated feeding center daily for&#xD;
      nutritional therapy to avoid the issue of food sharing. They will be provided with a phone&#xD;
      number to reach the clinic staff, and a member of the staff may visit a family's household&#xD;
      for directly observed nutritional therapy with prior arrangement if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Five day food frequency questionnaires will be completed at enrollment, prior to&#xD;
      randomization and weekly during the entire study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preparation of different MDCFs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preparation of complementary foods for Pre-POC clinical studies:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on compatible combinations of complementary food ingredients identified in the&#xD;
      preclinical studies described above, investigators will design and produce 5 MDCF prototypes&#xD;
      at the icddr,b Food Processing Laboratory in sufficient quantities for clinical studies (3&#xD;
      MDCF prototypes for Study 1, 2 MDCF prototypes for Study 2 and the qualified MDCF from Study&#xD;
      2 for Study 3). These formulations will be matched in energy density and micronutrient&#xD;
      content with ready-to-use supplementary foods (RUSFs) used for MAM in Bangladesh and other&#xD;
      countries, and will meet all other local requirements for a complementary/supplementary food&#xD;
      for 12-18 month old children with MAM and stunting. The icddr,b Food Processing Laboratory&#xD;
      will also produce the current rice-lentil RUSF standard of care used for treatment of these&#xD;
      children for use in studies 1 and 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Development of the product&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Identification of food ingredients: Locally available food ingredients including those&#xD;
           identified in the preclinical diet oscillation studies (e.g. chickpeas, soy flour,&#xD;
           peanuts, raw banana, soybean oil, sugar and with and without milk powder) will be used&#xD;
           to manufacture prototype MDCFs.&#xD;
&#xD;
           MDCFs will be fortified with a premix of vitamins and minerals to meet the micronutrient&#xD;
           requirements for supplementary foods in Bangladesh (see below).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Experiments on recipe development: The theoretical formulation of MDCF components shall&#xD;
           be made based on linear programming to identify the combinations of ingredients that&#xD;
           would result in the most nutritious recipes. The energy density of MDCF is targeted at&#xD;
           ~5 kcal/g, and caloric distribution is targeted to be 45-50 percent from fat and 8-12&#xD;
           percent from protein. Based on expert opinion and consensus within the research team,&#xD;
           micronutrient content shall be set to cover 70 percent of the requirements of Non SAM&#xD;
           children aged 12-18 months. Experiments for developing recipes and preparation of&#xD;
           samples will be done at icddr,b Food Processing Laboratory following a standardized&#xD;
           production procedure to control the quality of MDCF from each production batch and&#xD;
           ensure that no unexpected contamination and nutrient loss occur during processing. All&#xD;
           the ingredients will be cleaned and sorted. Potential recipes shall be produced in small&#xD;
           batches after (cooking/ steaming/ roasting as appropriate for each of the ingredients)&#xD;
           and by mixing all ingredients in an electric blender. When necessary, consistency of the&#xD;
           recipes shall be adjusted by varying the amount of dry ingredients and soybean oil.&#xD;
           Furthermore, the combination of minerals and vitamins shall be adjusted if there is any&#xD;
           unpleasant taste for addition of high dose(s) of micronutrients. A small amount (1&#xD;
           percent) of soy lecithin shall be added to the recipe in order to improve the&#xD;
           consistency and prevent oil separation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assessment of organoleptic properties of the recipes: The new recipes will be assessed&#xD;
           for appearance, flavor, consistency of the diets and overall degree of liking by using&#xD;
           the 7-point Hedonic scale. Higher value, that is 7, will be ranked as 'like extremely'&#xD;
           and lowest value of 1 will be ranked as 'dislike most'.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Study of food safety and shelf life issues: Investigators will evaluate the stability of&#xD;
           the product including microbiological quality to obtain key information needed for&#xD;
           setting up initial 'best before' date and assess the stability of vitamin and mineral&#xD;
           content and potential for oxidation. Standard microbiologic tests (total viable count,&#xD;
           yeasts, moulds, coliforms, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococci, Listeria&#xD;
           monocytogenes, Cronobacter sakazaki) will be performed at the icddr,b Food Safety&#xD;
           Laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Finalization of 5 prototype MDCFs for the pre-POC clinical trials: Based on all of the&#xD;
           above mentioned criteria, our team of researchers will select 5 MDCFs for acceptability&#xD;
           trials. investigators will also estimate the cost/kg of the ingredients of the candidate&#xD;
           MDCFs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training of field staff Training will be provided to all field team members on different&#xD;
      procedures regarding collection of stool samples. The training will be facilitated by core&#xD;
      group of trainers as well as investigators of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometry:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The age of the child will be verified against documentation (birth certificate or&#xD;
      immunization card, if available) or caregiver's report of the child's birth date. Length will&#xD;
      be measured by a infantometer sensitive to 0.1 cm (SECA, model no. 4161721009, Hamburg,&#xD;
      Germany). Body weight will be measured by a balance sensitive to 2 g (SECA 7281321009,&#xD;
      Hamburg, Germany). Length-for-age (LAZ), weight-for-length (WLZ) and Weight-for-Age (WAZ)&#xD;
      Z-scores will be calculated calculated following the Multicentre Growth Reference Study&#xD;
      (MGRS) WHO growth standards 11. Edema will be examined by pressing the upper side of both&#xD;
      feet for 3 seconds. Mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) will be measured using TALC MUAC tape&#xD;
      (UK). Standardization of the measuring equipments: Regular standardization of the baby&#xD;
      weighing scale, and the length/length board with a known weight and length will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses of plasma and fecal samples&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma samples collected this exploratory pre-POC study will be sent to Jeffrey Gordon's lab&#xD;
      located in the Center for Genome Sciences and Systems Biology at Washington University in St.&#xD;
      Louis. Advanced mass spectroscopic- and immunoassay-based methods will be used to obtain new&#xD;
      knowledge about the role of gut microbiota immaturity and the effects of attempting acute&#xD;
      repair of this immaturity with lead microbiota-directed complementary food (MDCF) prototypes&#xD;
      on biomarkers and mediators of healthy growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This initial test of the effects of MDCFs on microbiota immaturity and host responses to&#xD;
      dietary intervention will provide key datasets that will enable a power calculation for our&#xD;
      planned proof of concept study in a larger population. In the current exploratory pre-POC&#xD;
      each child in each group of 12-15 study participants will serve as his/her own control.&#xD;
      Additional comparisons will be made within and across the four treatment groups (i.e., those&#xD;
      consuming reference RUSF standard, and one of three different MDCF formulations).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feces would be collected weekly from each study participant during the course of the 8-week&#xD;
      study including the 2 weeks prior to treatment, the four weeks during treatment and the two&#xD;
      weeks following cessation of treatment. In addition, a 2 mL sample of blood would be obtained&#xD;
      just prior to initiating the 4 week MDCF intervention and just as the 4-week long&#xD;
      intervention is completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Targeted Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (UPLC-MS) and Gas&#xD;
      Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) will be used to profile analytes of specific&#xD;
      interest in plasma and/or fecal samples including bile acids and short chain fatty acids&#xD;
      (SCFAs); markers of mitochondrial function (e.g., β-hydroxybutyrate, acylcarnitines/acylCoAs,&#xD;
      TCA cycle intermediates); amino acids in serum plus fecal samples [branch chain amino acids,&#xD;
      tryptophan and tryptophan metabolites related to growth and inflammatory status, including&#xD;
      those produced by bacterial tryptophan metabolism (e.g. indole acetic acid derivatives)].&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, key mediators/biomarkers of linear growth (e.g., growth hormone and IGF-1),&#xD;
      energy utilization (insulin, leptin), and bone biology [IL-6, osteoprotegerin, the C-terminal&#xD;
      peptide of type I collagen (CTX, a marker of osteoclast activity/bone resorption), and the&#xD;
      amino-terminal propeptide of Type 1 procollagen (P1NP, a marker of osteoblast activity/bone&#xD;
      formation)], and systemic inflammation (CRP, AGP) will be quantified using established&#xD;
      ELISA/Luminex assays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information gathered will be used to select human fecal samples for transplantation into&#xD;
      germ-free animals; these animals, who will be fed the diets of their human microbiota donors,&#xD;
      will be used to further characterize the mechanisms that link MDCF prototypes, the gut&#xD;
      microbiota, and host physiology/metabolism. In addition, these plasma and fecal biomarkers&#xD;
      will be used to determine the features of our preclinical models are best correlated with&#xD;
      responses in children; this knowledge will help inform the design of next generation MDCF&#xD;
      prototypes with superior efficacy on growth outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome of this study will be the change in of Microbiota-for-Age Z (ΔMAZ) score&#xD;
      after 4 weeks of intervention.. Our previous work5 showed that the mean MAZ of 18-month-old&#xD;
      children with MAM was -1.60+0.36 (SEM) while for age-matched healthy children, the mean MAZ&#xD;
      was -0.52+0.22, with a difference between means of 1.08+0.41. Using R's power.t.test function&#xD;
      for a paired t-test (i.e. pairing samples from a child before and after intervention), with&#xD;
      and assumed SD of 1 and a one-sided hypothesis, 15 children in each arm will enable us to&#xD;
      capture an improvement in MAZ of &gt;0.7 with 80% power and a significance threshold of 0.05.&#xD;
      Investigators therefore anticipate being sufficiently powered to confidently detect a change&#xD;
      in MAZ of the magnitude that distinguished the microbiota of healthy children from that in&#xD;
      children with MAM in our prior study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis will be done with the same approach used for calculating microbiota maturity&#xD;
      and the application of these tools in a prior RUTF intervention study treating children with&#xD;
      SAM at icddr,b5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure in each study is the mean treatment-induced change in MAZ score&#xD;
      from baseline for each arm in the study. Differences (95% CI) between the means of treatment&#xD;
      arms will be assessed using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's HSD or similar post hoc test&#xD;
      (when appropriate). The MDCF prototype with the greatest mean effect size the in these&#xD;
      pre-POC studies, and acceptable organoleptic properties will be selected for the follow-on&#xD;
      POC clinical trial to examine clinical outcomes in children with post-SAM MAM.&#xD;
