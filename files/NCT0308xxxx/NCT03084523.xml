  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebrovascular disease is a major source of neural injury and there is an urgent need for&#xD;
      comprehensive evaluation of these patients. High-resolution MRI (HR-MRI) allows direct&#xD;
      visualization of intracranial vessel wall pathology in the setting of acute ischemic stroke&#xD;
      and intracranial aneurysm (intracranial aneurysm rupture.Vessel wall enhancement on HR-MRI&#xD;
      results from inflammation and has considerable potential as a marker of future stroke risk or&#xD;
      aneurysm rupture. We will use our HR-MRIvwMRI protocol and other techniques of measuring&#xD;
      plaque and aneurysms vulnerability, including laboratory markers of abnormal inflammation and&#xD;
      oxidization, which have been shown to correlate with vulnerable carotid atherosclerosis and&#xD;
      intracranial aneurysms, but have not been studied in symptomatic ICAS or IA.The unmet need is&#xD;
      a study validating HR-MRI reliability and the association of vessel-wall enhancement with&#xD;
      both symptomatic and pro-inflammatory status in patients with cerebrovascular disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intracranial atherosclerosis accounts for 10 to 40%, depending on ethnicity, of the 700,000&#xD;
      ischemic strokes in the United States every year.The annual rate of recurrent stroke in&#xD;
      patients with optimally treated Intracranial atherosclerosis remains more than twice the&#xD;
      average of other stroke etiologies (12.5% vs. 5%).Intracranial aneurysm ruptured affects up&#xD;
      to 30,000 Americans every year and 50% of patients die within a month of intracranial&#xD;
      aneurysm rupture.7 A robust literature has established that vessel wall MRI of extracranial&#xD;
      carotid vessel wall enhancement can predict stroke, independent of stenosis. Vessel wall&#xD;
      enhancement has been reported in symptomatic Intracranial atherosclerosis and intracranial&#xD;
      aneurysm but the role of local and systemic inflammation is unknown. Inflammatory biomarkers&#xD;
      are elevated in symptomatic extracranial atherosclerosis and in unstable intracranial&#xD;
      aneurysm, but the association with vessel wall MRI findings in Intracranial atherosclerosis&#xD;
      and intracranial aneurysm has not yet been explored.Vessel wall enhancement is typically&#xD;
      demonstrated by the uptake of gadolinium MRI contrast into the aneurysm wall or&#xD;
      atherosclerotic plaque. A novel MRI contrast agent, ferumoxytol, allows multicontrast&#xD;
      weighting on T1w and T2w images and provides important insight into the role of local vessel&#xD;
      wall inflammation by accumulating in macrophages on delayed T2* sequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify effective prevention and treatment strategies for cerebrovascular disease, the&#xD;
      investigator(s) need to critically evaluate vessel wall MRI techniques, determine vessel wall&#xD;
      enhancement prevalence, and explore the link between vessel wall enhancement and&#xD;
      inflammation. The investigator(s) hypothesize that vessel wall enhancement is reliable,&#xD;
      associated with symptomatic Intracranial atherosclerosis/intracranial aneurysm and higher&#xD;
      levels of inflammatory biomarkers. In order to answer our hypotheses, the investigator(s)&#xD;
      propose a pilot study on 80 participants. The investigator(s) will opportunistically enroll&#xD;
      participants who receive standard of care vessel wall MRI with gadolinium contrast or perform&#xD;
      a baseline vessel wall MRI with gadolinium if needed. Intracranial atherosclerosis&#xD;
      participants will have a total of 2-3 study vessel wall MRIs. Study MRI #1 will be performed&#xD;
      with gadolinium, if a standard of care MRI has not already been performed. Study MRI #2 will&#xD;
      be performed 72-78 hours post- using ferumoxytol contrast infusion. Study MRI #3 is a&#xD;
      follow-up vessel wall MRI with gadolinium in 1 year. Intracranial aneurysm participants will&#xD;
      have 1-2 MRIs depending on if they have already had a baseline MRI.Study MRI #2 will be&#xD;
      performed 72-78 hours post- using ferumoxytol contrast infusion. The investigator(s) will&#xD;
      analyze two groups of participants 60 with intracranial atherosclerosis and 20 with&#xD;
      intracranial aneurysms.&#xD;
