      This is a phase II single centre open label single arm pre-operative window of metformin&#xD;
      treatment in stage I-IIIa Non small cell lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In which patients will be invited to participate by receiving Metformin treatment during 14&#xD;
      to 21 days at 850 mg BID until the day before surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will be followed closely for any Adverse Events during treatment and 30 days after&#xD;
      surgery. During treatment there will be no follow up tests except 1 fasting blood glucose at&#xD;
      week 2 of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survival data will be prospectively gathered after study treatment has ended until death.&#xD;

      Title of study: Phase II study of single agent pre-operative metformin in patients with&#xD;
      clinical stage I - IIIA NSCLC proceeding to surgical resection. 'Lung Metcore Study'&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the effects of short-term pre-operative exposure to metformin in operable stages&#xD;
      I to IIIA NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary end-points:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The difference in the proportion of proliferating NSCLC cells (measured by comparing&#xD;
           Ki67 levels) prior to and after metformin treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The rate of apoptosis of NSCLC (measured by the TUNEL assay) prior to and after&#xD;
           metformin treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary end-points:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The safety and tolerability of preoperative metformin administration in NSCLC, as&#xD;
           assessed by National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events&#xD;
           (NCI CTCAE [version 4.0])&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pathologic changes in lung tissue after metformin administration. Study Design: This&#xD;
           trial is designed as a single center, open label, single arm Phase II study of a&#xD;
           pre-operative window of metformin treatment in stages I - IIIA NSCLC. The efficacy of&#xD;
           metformin will be assessed by its effects on markers of cellular proliferation and&#xD;
           apoptosis. Exploratory analysis of molecular markers of the hypothesized effects of&#xD;
           metformin in NSCLC will also be carried out. Furthermore, changes in serum ligands to&#xD;
           growth signaling pathways in lung cancer with metformin treatment will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of patients: Thus, the total expected sample size is approximately 50 patients,&#xD;
      anticipating minimal loss of eligible participants through treatment intolerance or&#xD;
      acceleration of surgery. Accrual is estimated at 1.5 to 2 patients per month for 25 to 33&#xD;
      months, based on accrual rates for a recent pre-operative window thoracic surgical study at&#xD;
      UHN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Metformin will be started at a dose of 850mg daily then increased to 850mg b.i.d. (morning&#xD;
      and evening) after 5 days as tolerated. Treatment will be given from the time of enrollment&#xD;
      till the evening prior to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Correlatives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following molecular and serological correlative biomarkers will be considered covariates&#xD;
      in the analysis of primary endpoints of the phase II study. Covariate pretreatment values and&#xD;
      changes in covariate values (where applicable) will be used to estimate the relationship&#xD;
      between covariates and patient's Ki67 or apoptotic response using logistic regression. It is&#xD;
      noted that several covariates are being tested and the number of patients being analyzed is&#xD;
      small, thus, some tests may be statistically significant due to chance even if no association&#xD;
      exists.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
             -  Adiponectin&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who completed metformin treatment will have the Ki67 and apoptosis scores compared&#xD;
      between samples obtained pre and post-metformin treatment. Changes in Ki67 and apoptotic&#xD;
      scores with metformin treatment will be correlated with the biomarkers of various pathways&#xD;
      hypothesized to mediate an effect of metformin on NSCLC development.&#xD;
