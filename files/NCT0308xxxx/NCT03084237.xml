      This is a Phase III, double-blind, randomized multicenter study to compare the efficacy and&#xD;
      to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of HLX02 and European Union (EU)-sourced Herceptin®&#xD;
      in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive, recurrent or&#xD;
      previously untreated metastatic breast cancer. Eligible patients will be assessed centrally&#xD;
      for HER2 status and the presence of at least one measurable target lesion before&#xD;
      randomization. Patients will undergo a tumor assessment for evaluation of response according&#xD;
      to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) every 6 weeks up to&#xD;
      24 weeks (regardless of the number of cycles actually given); thereafter, assessments will be&#xD;
      done every 9 weeks (after Cycles 11, 14, and 17) or earlier in the case of clinical signs of&#xD;
      progression.&#xD;
