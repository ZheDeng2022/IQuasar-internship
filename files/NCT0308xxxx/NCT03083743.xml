             lesions (diameter of tumor lesions displayed on CT scan ≥ 10 mm; short diameter of&#xD;
             lymph node lesions on CT scan ≥ 15 mm; and no radiotherapy, radiofrequency ablation or&#xD;
             other local treatment has been given to such measurable lesions)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients with negative EGFR or ALK gene-sensitive mutations or unknown status and with&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Patients with positive EGFR-TKI or ALK-TKI gene-sensitive mutations and with treatment&#xD;

             regimen may be included. Note that treatment given in neo-adjuvant therapy phase is&#xD;
             not considered a part of the treatment regimen; however, if recurrence occurred within&#xD;
             6 months after the end of adjuvant therapy, the adjuvant therapy is considered a part&#xD;
             of the treatment regimen, and if not within such 6 months, the adjuvant therapy is not&#xD;
             considered a part of the treatment regimen.&#xD;

             progression; (2) patients withdrawn from standard treatment due to inability to&#xD;
             tolerate adverse events of grade IV and above hematological toxicity, of grade II and&#xD;
             above non-hematological toxicity or of grade II and above major organ damage, such as&#xD;
             heart, liver and kidney according to NCI-CTCAE Version 4.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. ECOG status 0-1&#xD;
