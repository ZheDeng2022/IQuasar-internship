  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Chronic Widespread Pain (CWP) is a multidimensional disorder for which treatment&#xD;
      as yet remains unsatisfactory. Acupuncture is one of the most sought therapeutic methods when&#xD;
      it comes to alternative medicine, due to its minimal adverse effects and its ease of use in&#xD;
      clinical practice. Currently, acupuncture is successfully used in China for the treatment of&#xD;
      many chronic diseases. The work to be carried out aims to assess the effects of acupuncture&#xD;
      on pain management and quality of life of people suffering from CWP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods/design: The study is a single-center, controlled triple-blind prospective study. A&#xD;
      total of 100 participants will be randomly distributed into two groups, the intervention&#xD;
      group, which will receive an individualized acupuncture treatment; and control group, which&#xD;
      will receive sham acupuncture. The treatments performed will be personalized and the&#xD;
      treatment criteria will be based on the use of the Yuan and Luo points. They will be&#xD;
      evaluated using a specific measurement system, constituted of the Visual Analogue Scale, The&#xD;
      Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire and The Medical Outcomes Study Sleep Scale. The primary&#xD;
      outcome measures assess whether acupuncture can bring about a decrease in pain and an&#xD;
      improvement in the quality of life of people suffering from chronic widespread pain; the&#xD;
      secondary outcomes assess whether the use of acupuncture leads to improved sleep quality. The&#xD;
      results obtained will be analysed at 1st, 4th and 8th weeks from the start of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion: This technique is aimed to restore some of the imbalances suffered by patients&#xD;
      affected with CWP and to improve their symptomatology. We expect to observe a significant&#xD;
      improvement in the pain, quality of life and sleep quality of people affected with CWP. The&#xD;
      study will be conducted according to the STRICTA guidelines, which lay down the right way to&#xD;
      proceed when carrying out scientific studies in the field of acupuncture.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Widespread Pain (CWP) is defined as spinal pain that lasts at least three months&#xD;
      involving both the right and left side of the body, above and below the waist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CWP is a highly prevalent condition. According to Clauw et al., it affects 10-12% of the&#xD;
      population and, according to Bergman et al., 10-11%. More recent studies show similar data.&#xD;
      For their part, Mas et al. (2008) found in a nationwide study that the prevalence of&#xD;
      fibromyalgia in Spain was of 4.2% in women and 0.2% in men, mainly in the age range between&#xD;
      40-49 years. All these studies have been performed in countries in the developed world and,&#xD;
      most of the time, they have also analysed the prevalence of fibromyalgia (FM) among the same&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, acupuncture is successfully used in China for the treatment of many chronic&#xD;
      diseases. However, in the West, the situation is quite different: acupuncture is little known&#xD;
      and not commonly used, giving thus rise to mistrust and misunderstandings. Nevertheless, in&#xD;
      recent years, studies have been published both in the East and in the West showing, on the&#xD;
      one hand, the intention of traditional Chinese medicine to examine the technique and, on the&#xD;
      other, the importance and recognition that the Western medical world is starting to bestow&#xD;
      upon Chinese medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS/DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study seeks to meet the following objectives: assess whether acupuncture can bring about&#xD;
      a decrease in pain and an improvement in the quality of life of people suffering from chronic&#xD;
      widespread pain; assess whether the use of acupuncture leads to improved sleep quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acupuncture succeeds in reducing the pain suffered by people affected with chronic widespread&#xD;
      pain (CWP) and in improving their quality of life. Acupuncture can improve pain and different&#xD;
      items that have an impact on the quality of life (sleep quality and performance of daily&#xD;
      activities).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical trial. Controlled triple-blind prospective study. 100 participants will be randomly&#xD;
      distributed into two groups: intervention group (A), which will receive an individualized&#xD;
      acupuncture treatment; and control group (S), which will receive sham acupuncture using a&#xD;
      randomization 1:1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants in the study will be people over 18 years old belonging to different&#xD;
      associations of people affected with fibromyalgia from the area of Terres de l'Ebre,&#xD;
      particularly from associations of the towns of Deltebre, Amposta, Sant Carles de la Rápita&#xD;
      and Tortosa. Researchers will come to these entities in order to present the study in a&#xD;
      public conference. Once the requests for participation have been received and all cases have&#xD;
      been assessed on the basis of the inclusion and exclusion criteria, participants will be&#xD;
      informed of the whole research process in a personal interview. After that, they will all&#xD;
      receive an information sheet and an informed consent form, which they will be encouraged to&#xD;
      read and sign.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion and exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Meeting the criteria set by the American College of Rheumatology for the diagnosis of&#xD;
           chronic widespread pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Accepting to sign the informed consent of participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Being older than 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Suffering from malignant diseases or active rheumatologic disorders (osteoporosis,&#xD;
           rheumatoid arthritis, lupus erythematosus, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Suffering from coxarthrosis or severe gonarthrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Having previously received acupuncture treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
      People meeting the inclusion criteria, being subsequently informed of the nature of the study&#xD;
      and having signed the informed consent, will be assigned to one of the groups of the study.&#xD;
      Randomization will be carried out by personnel other than the one performing the treatments&#xD;
      and on the basis of a list obtained through the software EPIDAT (Xunta de Galicia), in such a&#xD;
      manner that there shall be 50 people in each group: one will be treated with acupuncture&#xD;
      according to the traditional technique to improve pain, whereas the other will act as a&#xD;
      control group and will receive sham acupuncture. The researcher conducting the treatments&#xD;
      will be provided with the patients' medical history together with their corresponding&#xD;
      allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Masking&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are blinded to the intervention. They will be provided with eye masks so that&#xD;
      they cannot see which needles are used in their intervention. Moreover, the same type of&#xD;
      equipment will be used with all the participants (although the guide tube to insert the&#xD;
      needle is not necessary in true acupuncture).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the fact that the person who carries out the intervention is different than the one&#xD;
      assessing its effects and the latter does not know which group the evaluated subjects belong&#xD;
      to, as well as the fact that the person responsible for the statistics is a third person who&#xD;
      ignores which of the two groups has received true acupuncture, this is a triple-blind study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted according to the STRICTA guidelines, which lay down the right way&#xD;
      to proceed when carrying out scientific studies in the field of acupuncture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients taking part in the trial will receive a total of 5 sessions of acupuncture (true or&#xD;
      sham, depending on the group to which they belong within the study): 4 sessions (one per&#xD;
      week) and a 5th session 15 days after the last one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention group (A)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatments performed will be personalized and the treatment criteria will be based on the&#xD;
      use of the Yuan and Luo points. In clinical practice, the Yuan (source) points and the Luo&#xD;
      (connecting) points can be used jointly, linking the two associated meridians&#xD;
      (external-internal) in such a way that, after assessing the state of a meridian's path, its&#xD;
      Yuan point will be combined with the Luo point of its coupled meridian and vice versa; all&#xD;
      this depending on the condition of the muscle fibres and on the path that wants to be treated&#xD;
      for these. Generally, it is used to transfer energy from one meridian to the other and vice&#xD;
      versa, depending on the condition presented by the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The needles used for the treatments will be single-use needles of two different gauge sizes.&#xD;
      One size or the other will be used depending on the area to be treated and the physical&#xD;
      condition of the patient. The needles and gauge sizes used in the study are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dong Bang siliconized needle 0.25 mm x 40 mm Dong Bang siliconized needle 0.20 mm x 30 mm&#xD;
&#xD;
      The therapist will assess the patient's condition according to traditional Chinese medicine&#xD;
      and will look at the relationship between the patient's most affected areas and the paths of&#xD;
      the acupuncture meridians. Subsequently, the combination of Yuan and Luo points to be treated&#xD;
      will be determined. This procedure will be followed before every acupuncture session, in such&#xD;
      a way that the combination of the points used will depend on the evolution of the symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group (C)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sham acupuncture:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The course of action with the patient from the group that will use sham acupuncture will be&#xD;
      the same as in the group that receives real treatment: patient in supine position, cleaning&#xD;
      of the treated area, use of eye mask during the treatments and selection of points following&#xD;
      the previously described Yuan and Luo points' criteria, based on traditional Chinese&#xD;
      medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The difference of sham acupuncture will lie on the way of performing the acupuncture&#xD;
      technique. It will follow the validated technique of sham acupuncture with the Park device,&#xD;
      without needle penetration in the patient's body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Park device for the performance of sham acupuncture consists of two plastic tubes, one&#xD;
      sliding within the other, and inside which the needle created for the device slides. The&#xD;
      longest tube is attached to a circular base, which has an adhesive surface that sticks to the&#xD;
      skin so that the device and the needle cannot fall. Blunt ended needles will be used for this&#xD;
      technique and thus the needle does not get to pass through the skin but produces a cutaneous&#xD;
      stimulation similar to conventional acupuncture needles. These needles are supplied with the&#xD;
      kit that contains the Park sham acupuncture device and are registered in the European Union&#xD;
      as CE 0120.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study variables&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main study variables are pain and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain will be assessed using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). The VAS consisted of a 10 mm&#xD;
      line with the endpoints 'no pain' and 'worst pain imaginable'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) will be used to analyse the quality of life. The&#xD;
      FIQ is a multidimensional questionnaire designed specifically to assess the functional&#xD;
      capacity of fibromyalgia patients. It is designed so that it can be self-administered by the&#xD;
      patient. The values of the FIQ are between 0 and 100, 0 being the best state of health and&#xD;
      100 the worst. It takes five minutes to complete the FIQ. In this study, the Spanish version&#xD;
      of the Revised Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQR) was used, which has proved its&#xD;
      reliability and good construct validity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary variables are sleep quality and the subjective perception of participants&#xD;
      regarding the effects of the treatment. The Medical Outcomes Study Sleep Scale (MOS-SS) will&#xD;
      be used to assess the sleep quality. This specific questionnaire includes 12 items assessing&#xD;
      data such as the quantity and quality of sleep. Items' responses were assigned scores using&#xD;
      conventional scoring rules, with higher scores indicating a greater severity of sleep&#xD;
      disturbance. The subjective perception of participants regarding the effects of the treatment&#xD;
      will be assessed through the Patient Global Impression of Improvement Scale (PGI-I). The&#xD;
      PGI-I consists of a single question in which patients are asked to classify the relief&#xD;
      obtained with the treatment that they are following according to a seven-point scale from&#xD;
      'very much better to very much worse'. Only responses 'very much better' or 'much better' are&#xD;
      associated with a successful treatment. All the other response options are defined as&#xD;
      treatment failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These variables will be collected during the 8 weeks of the study, based on the individual&#xD;
      interviews with the patients before each session and once the intervention is completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interview with the patient will be conducted in the first session, when the physiotherapy&#xD;
      clinical record will be created and the study tests will be taken for the first time. During&#xD;
      the next 3 weeks, one weekly session of acupuncture will take place, thus adding up to 4&#xD;
      acupuncture sessions. Before the fourth study session, the tests will be taken again. Then,&#xD;
      there will be another week of rest from interventions and, during the 6th week of the study,&#xD;
      a new acupuncture intervention will be performed. One more week without intervention will&#xD;
      then follow and the eighth week of the study will be only devoted to carrying out the tests&#xD;
      in order to retrieve the survey data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is important to note that, in this last week of the study, a particular test will be&#xD;
      conducted for the first time: the one related to the patient's impression of improvement with&#xD;
      the treatment (PGI-I).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be collected by researcher #2, blinded to the specific intervention group the&#xD;
      subjects belong to.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calculation of sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acupuncture is considered to be effective in pain management if improvement according to the&#xD;
      VAS scale is equal to or greater than 20%. On the basis of previous studies, it has been&#xD;
      calculated that, in order to obtain an alpha error of 0.05 and a study power of 80%, a sample&#xD;
      of 90 people is required (45 per group). Since a dropout of 10% is foreseen, this number has&#xD;
      been extended to 100 (50 per group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic and basal variables will be defined using different measures. For a quantitative&#xD;
      variable, the following will be used: mean, standard deviation and confidence interval at&#xD;
      95%. In addition to this, in case the variable did not have normal distribution, more robust&#xD;
      descriptive statistics will be foreseen for the calculations, such as the median, the&#xD;
      interquartile range and the minimum and maximum values. In the case of a qualitative&#xD;
      variable, a frequency distribution will be drawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to assess potential changes in the instruments and scales used in the study over&#xD;
      time, contrasts for dependent variables will be used, namely the ANOVA test for repeated&#xD;
      measures or the Friedman test, depending on whether or not the distribution of the variable&#xD;
      is normal. The Shapiro-Wilks test will be used for the normality test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, if differences existed among the different moments in which the instrument&#xD;
      is evaluated, the ANOVA test for repeated measures will allow for the analysis of whether&#xD;
      these differences are the same or different depending on the type of intervention performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similarly, a variable that assesses changes in the main variables during the study will be&#xD;
      created and a non-parametric contrast will be done in order to analyse whether such changes&#xD;
      have been equal among the two groups. To finalise, a multivariate model will be applied in&#xD;
      order to verify whether the intervention group has improved the parameters to be measured&#xD;
      (linear or logistic regression depending on the dependent variable's nature). Such a model&#xD;
      will be validated through the standard procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Processing of data&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to ensure a proper collection and processing of the data obtained, these will be&#xD;
      managed by qualified staff from the same university and will be implemented by the clinical&#xD;
      research coordinator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the study will be controlled at all times against any adverse effects or&#xD;
      complications, such as swelling, pain, hematomas in the needle insertion areas, discomfort,&#xD;
      dizziness or heart palpitations after receiving the treatment. After every session and before&#xD;
      starting the next one, questions will be asked to the participants and a visual inspection&#xD;
      will be carried out in order to assess the potential undesirable effects of the last&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical principles&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Clinical Research Ethics Committee (CREC) of the Hospital Universitario Sant Joan de Reus&#xD;
      has approved this protocol under approval reference number (15-07-30/7aclaproj1). The&#xD;
      patients' data will be protected and will only be used for the purposes of this research.&#xD;
