  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-arm, multi-center, phase 2 Study to evaluate SHR-1210(anti-PD-1&#xD;
      antibody) in in adult Chinese patients with advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer&#xD;
      who failed or progressed to prior first-line systemic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled subjects will be assigned to 4 cohorts on the basis of PD-L1 expression in tumor&#xD;
      cells(&lt;1%, ≥1%-25%, ≥25%-50%, ≥50%) all will be treated with the standard SHR-1210 dose&#xD;
      (200mg) , Q2W, until documented progressive disease (PD) occurs. Subjects will return to the&#xD;
      clinic once every two weeks. Radiographic disease assessments will be performed every 6&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary study hypothesis is that treatment with SHR-1210 improves Objective Response Rate&#xD;
      when compare with standard second-line therapy, no matter how much PD-L1 expression in tumor.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In similar clinical trials, anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies produce durable responses in&#xD;
      approximately 20% of unselected patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. Developing&#xD;
      reliable, validated biomarkers that identify patients with an increased probability of&#xD;
      response to these antibodies remains a challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because the PD-1 pathway may be a key mechanism of immune escape in a subgroup of patients&#xD;
      with non-small-cell lung cancer, PD-L1 expression in tumor or inflammatory cells is a&#xD;
      candidate biomarker. However, PD-L1 expression has not been formally validated as a biomarker&#xD;
      in contemporaneously collected tumor tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally the purpose of the study is to assess the correlation between the expression of&#xD;
      PD-L1 in the tumor and the response to treatment with SHR-1210 in non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;
