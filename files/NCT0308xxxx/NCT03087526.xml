      The purpose of this study is to develop and validate an analytical and clinical NIPD test for&#xD;
      triplet repeat diseases by isolated circulating fetal trophoblastic cells (CFTC) analysis&#xD;
      from maternal blood, searching for the familial mutation in families at risk of having one of&#xD;
      the following triplet repeat diseases: Huntington's disease, Steinert Myotonic dystrophy,&#xD;
      Fragile X syndrome, spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) 1, 2 and 3.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Non Invasive Prenatal Diagnosis (NIPD), based on the analysis of circulating cell-free fetal&#xD;
      DNA (cff-DNA) is very promising for early diagnosis of monogenic diseases. Such an approach&#xD;
      is a safer alternative to invasive methods of prenatal testing (amniocentesis or&#xD;
      choriocentesis) which entails a significant risk of miscarriage (0.5%-1%). However, technical&#xD;
      issues related to the characteristics of cff-DNA remain and do not allow the search of all&#xD;
      the mutations, in particular triplet expansion mutations which concern rare and incurable&#xD;
      diseases (Huntington's disease, Steinert Myotonic dystrophy, Fragile X syndrome, SCA1, 2, 3).&#xD;
      Indeed, the strong fragmentation and the short size of cff-DNA (143 bp) do not allow direct&#xD;
      detection of these mutations. However, Prenatal Diagnosis (PND) requests for this group of&#xD;
      pathologies represent the second most frequent PND indication at the national level after&#xD;
      cystic fibrosis (ABM 2013). An alternative approach is to perform analysis on circulating&#xD;
      fetal trophoblastic cells (CFTC) from maternal blood. Several methods have been used to&#xD;
      isolate CFTCs from maternal blood. However, to date, no test is reliable enough for a routine&#xD;
      application to replace invasive protocols. Recently, new enrichment systems have been&#xD;
      optimized for circulating tumor cells (CTCs) as a liquid biopsy of cancer. Some of these new&#xD;
      technologies can be easily applied to the isolation and characterization of CFTCs. The&#xD;
      objective of this study is to complete our NIPD services by developing an approach on CFTC&#xD;
      adapted to the analysis of triplet repeat diseases, which cannot be performed on cff-DNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a multicenter, prospective study for performance evaluation of a diagnostic method. The&#xD;
      subjects included will be pregnant women between 9 and 34 weeks of gestation and their&#xD;
      partner (future fathers). Pregnant woman and future father genotypes (sick or healthy) are&#xD;
      known for one of the following diseases: Huntington's disease, Steinert's myotonic dystrophy,&#xD;
      fragile X and spinocerebellar ataxias types 1, 2 or 3. The main objective is achieved by the&#xD;
      agreement between gold standard (PND by amniocentesis or choriocentesis) and NIPD results for&#xD;
      each pregnant woman participating in the study (the absence or presence of the mutated&#xD;
      allele).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The couple inclusion will take place in one of the participating medical genetic centers&#xD;
      during genetic counseling consultation for a pregnancy at risk for one of the pathologies&#xD;
      mentioned above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this visit, the pregnant woman's blood sample (blood sample taken on 3 x 10 ml BCT and&#xD;
      5 ml on EDTA) and the future father (5 ml on EDTA) will be carried out. The duration of&#xD;
      inclusion is the time of the visit. Blood collection of pregnant women on cell-free DNA&#xD;
      &quot;Blood Collection Tubes&quot; (BCT) to screen CFTCs will be addressed to the Human Rare&#xD;
      Circulating Cells Laboratory (LCCRH). The molecular analysis of the CFTC isolated by the&#xD;
      LCCRH as well as the genomic DNA extraction and analysis (from the 5 ml of blood on EDTA) of&#xD;
      the couple will be carried out by the Laboratory of Molecular Genetics (LGM) located in the&#xD;
      same Building (IURC - Montpellier University Hospital).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis performed on a simple maternal blood test will allow to determine whether the&#xD;
      future child is affected or not by the inherited disease. With this new NIPD approach, there&#xD;
      could be a 50% decrease in the use of the invasive method for PND. This analysis can be&#xD;
      offered to women carrying foetuses at risk for triplet repeat diseases. Finally, this&#xD;
      approach can be applied to any monogenic diseases by CFTCs isolation automation from maternal&#xD;
      blood.&#xD;
