      The primary objectives of this study are to determine the effect of apremilast on aortic&#xD;
      vascular inflammation, cardiometabolic biomarkers and body composition in patients with&#xD;
      moderate-severe psoriasis. FDG-PET/CT will be used to assess vascular inflammation, with&#xD;
      multi-volumetric product, tissue-to-background ratio and total atherosclerotic burden, and&#xD;
      body composition via volumetric quantification. This is a year-long, single arm, open label&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
