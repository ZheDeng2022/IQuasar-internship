  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infection with HIV (the virus that causes AIDS) can lead to problems with brain function,&#xD;
      such as memory, concentration, judgment, and the speed or control of hands and legs.&#xD;
      Neurologists have called this condition HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND). This&#xD;
      research is being done to see if insulin taken through the nose as a spray (intranasal&#xD;
      insulin) can help people with HIV who are having problems with memory and brain function, or&#xD;
      HAND.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be given either insulin or placebo. A placebo is an inactive substance that&#xD;
      looks like the study drug, but does not contain study drug. For this research study, the&#xD;
      placebo will be a clear, saline-based liquid spray that looks like the insulin spray but has&#xD;
      no insulin. Participants will not be told whether they receive insulin or placebo during the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will take the intranasal spray twice a day, about 30 minutes after a meal.&#xD;
      Participants will use a specialized intranasal drug administration device. The total daily&#xD;
      dose of insulin is 40 IU split between 20 IU in the morning and 20 IU in the evening.&#xD;
      Participants will take the intranasal spray for 24 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers will record symptoms and side effects during the study. Procedures include&#xD;
      neurocognitive testing of memory and brain function, two optional lumbar punctures (&quot;spinal&#xD;
      taps&quot;), two MRI brain scans, monthly blood draws, and clinical assessments.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) are characterized by disabling cognitive,&#xD;
      behavioral, and motor dysfunction and can occur in individuals with HIV even while taking&#xD;
      combination antiretroviral therapy (ART). The mechanisms for these residual impairments are&#xD;
      not fully understood, but appear to involve poor penetrance of ART drugs into the central&#xD;
      nervous system (CNS) and the resulting brain sanctuary for inadequately suppressed HIV&#xD;
      infection with associated sustained inflammation. Adjunctive therapies with targeted&#xD;
      neuroprotective agents are critically needed for the treatment of HAND. Insulin is involved&#xD;
      in multiple CNS functions including food intake, metabolism, learning, and memory. Insulin&#xD;
      has neuroprotective properties demonstrated in cell culture experiments and in vivo models,&#xD;
      which provide strong evidence for its use as a therapeutic agent to treat HAND.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insulin modifying therapy (IMT) includes intranasal insulin administered by a novel nasal&#xD;
      drug delivery device. IMT may play important roles in neuronal plasticity and survival by&#xD;
      protecting hippocampal neurons against oxidative stress and apoptotic cell death induced by&#xD;
      glutamate neurotoxicity. Previous studies support the proposed early phase trial of IMT as a&#xD;
      novel therapeutic agent for HAND.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This double-blinded placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluates safety of intranasal insulin&#xD;
      at the daily dose of 40 IU and will provide initial data for assessing safety and efficacy.&#xD;
      The protocol measures safety by incidence and frequency of adverse events. Clinical effects&#xD;
      of IMT over the 24-week trial period are measured by change in neurocognitive and functional&#xD;
      testing results, as well as several novel radiological and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)&#xD;
      surrogate markers. Outcomes from these studies could have important implications for the&#xD;
      design of future studies with IMT and other neuroprotective compounds for HAND.&#xD;

  <why_stopped>
    On 3/15/2020 study visits were suspended due to COVID-19 pandemic. With safety concerns&#xD;
    surrounding COVID-19 and difficulty recruiting, the investigators decided to close enrollment&#xD;
    10/16/2020 after interim data were reviewed by the DSMB and NIH.&#xD;

    <measure>Neurocognitive Performance: Global Deficit Score (GDS), Week 24 Visit Score Minus Baseline Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Difference between baseline and week 24 visits</time_frame>
    <description>Change in GDS, measured at two time points, baseline and Week 24 visits. GDS is a composite score based on neurocognitive test performance. The 14 data points that comprise the GDS include Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (trials 1-3 total score and delayed recall), Rey Complex Figure Test (copy and delayed recall), WAIS symbol-digit test, grooved pegboard (dominant and non-dominant), CalCAP (Choice reaction time and Sequential reaction time), Trail-making Test (Parts A and B), Stroop Color Interference Test (trial 3), timed gait (3 trials average), and verbal fluency (FAS). Raw scores were transformed to t-scores using age/education stratified normative data, then assigned a discrete value from 0 to 5 using the following t-score categorization: &gt; or = 40 is '0', 35.00 to 39.99 is '1', 30.00 to 34.99 is '2', 25.00 to 29.99 is '3', 20.00 to 24.99 is '4', and &lt;20 is '5'. The 14 individual scores were then averaged. A higher GDS is a worse outcome (0 = no deficits and 5 = maximum deficits).</description>

    <measure>Neurocognitive Performance: NPZ-8 Score, Week 24 Visit Score Minus Baseline Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Difference between baseline and week 24 visits</time_frame>
    <description>NPZ-8 score at 24 weeks minus baseline NPZ-8 score: The NPZ-8 is an average of 8 individual Z-scores, where higher values indicate greater neurocognitive performance (better outcome). The NPZ-8 represents the number of standard deviations an individual's performance is away from the mean (Z-score = 0) of age and education matched reference populations where performance worse than the mean had negative Z-scores (i.e. Z-scores were inverted for tests scored on speed). The NPZ-8 average is comprised of 8 data points from 6 tests: timed gait, WAIS symbol-digit, grooved pegboard dominant &amp; non-dominant, CalCAP Choice &amp; Sequential reaction times, and the Trail-making Test parts A &amp; B. Raw scores were transformed to Z-scores for each test and then averaged to calculate the NPZ-8 score at each visit (Z-scores +/-3.5 standard deviations from mean limited to +/-3.5). Positive change in NPZ-8 from baseline to Week 24 indicated improved performance and negative change indicated worse performance.</description>

          <title>Global Deficit Score (GDS), Baseline</title>
          <description>GDS is a composite score of neurocognitive test performance comprised of 14 data points from 9 tests (Hopkins Verbal Learning, Rey Complex Figure, WAIS symbol-digit, grooved pegboard, CalCAP, Trail-making, Stroop Color Interference, timed gait, and FAS verbal fluency). Raw scores were transformed to t-scores using age/education stratified norms, assigned discrete values 0 to 5 (t-score categorization &gt; or =40 is 0, 35.00 to 39.99 =1, 30.00 to 34.99 =2, 25.00 to 29.99 =3, 20.00 to 24.99 =4, and &lt;20 =5) and then averaged. Higher GDS is a worse outcome (0 = no deficits and 5 = maximum deficits).</description>
          <population>Enrolled: All participants started on study intervention. Completed Trial (ITT): All participants with both primary outcome measures at 24 weeks.&#xD;
Completed Trial (Per Protocol): Participants with both primary outcome measures at 24 weeks and who demonstrated greater than 16 weeks adherence to the study intervention.</population>

          <title>Estimated IQ, Hopkins Adult Reading Test</title>
          <description>The Hopkins Adult Reading Test (HART) is a standard 35 item word list that the participant reads while the tester assesses his/her pronunciation of each word. One point is awarded for each correct pronunciation (raw score range 0-35). The number correct is then transformed to a standard score based on age/education/sex/race matched normative data with the mean set to 100 and standard deviation of 15 (range defined valid between 73 and 131). Higher scores indicate greater word recognition. It serves as an estimated measure of premorbid abilities (i.e. Intelligence Quotient).</description>
          <population>Two participants did not perform the Hopkins Adult Reading Test at baseline. Enrolled: All participants started on study intervention. Completed Trial (ITT): All participants with both primary outcome measures at 24 weeks.&#xD;
Completed Trial (Per Protocol): Participants with both primary outcome measures at 24 weeks and who demonstrated greater than 16 weeks adherence to the study intervention.</population>

The raw scores were transformed to Z-scores based on age-matched reference population data. The Z-score indicates the number of standard deviations away from the mean. A Z-score of 0 is equal to the mean of the reference population with negative numbers indicating values lower than the mean and positive values higher. Higher Z scores indicate a greater visual-spatial reconstruction score (better outcome). Z-scores under -3.5 were limited to -3.5.</description>

          <title>Grooved Pegboard Test, Dominant Hand</title>
          <description>Time to complete grooved pegboard task with dominant hand. The raw scores (measured in seconds) were transformed to directionally inverted Z-scores based on age/education/sex-matched reference population data. The Z-score indicates the number of standard deviations away from the mean. A Z-score of 0 is equal to the mean of the reference population. The inverted Z-scores produce negative numbers when times are higher than the mean and positive values when times are lower. Higher Z-scores indicate a greater motor speed (better outcome). Z-scores under -3.5 were limited to -3.5.</description>

        <title>Neurocognitive Performance: Global Deficit Score (GDS), Week 24 Visit Score Minus Baseline Score</title>
        <description>Change in GDS, measured at two time points, baseline and Week 24 visits. GDS is a composite score based on neurocognitive test performance. The 14 data points that comprise the GDS include Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (trials 1-3 total score and delayed recall), Rey Complex Figure Test (copy and delayed recall), WAIS symbol-digit test, grooved pegboard (dominant and non-dominant), CalCAP (Choice reaction time and Sequential reaction time), Trail-making Test (Parts A and B), Stroop Color Interference Test (trial 3), timed gait (3 trials average), and verbal fluency (FAS). Raw scores were transformed to t-scores using age/education stratified normative data, then assigned a discrete value from 0 to 5 using the following t-score categorization: &gt; or = 40 is '0', 35.00 to 39.99 is '1', 30.00 to 34.99 is '2', 25.00 to 29.99 is '3', 20.00 to 24.99 is '4', and &lt;20 is '5'. The 14 individual scores were then averaged. A higher GDS is a worse outcome (0 = no deficits and 5 = maximum deficits).</description>

        <title>Neurocognitive Performance: NPZ-8 Score, Week 24 Visit Score Minus Baseline Score</title>
        <description>NPZ-8 score at 24 weeks minus baseline NPZ-8 score: The NPZ-8 is an average of 8 individual Z-scores, where higher values indicate greater neurocognitive performance (better outcome). The NPZ-8 represents the number of standard deviations an individual's performance is away from the mean (Z-score = 0) of age and education matched reference populations where performance worse than the mean had negative Z-scores (i.e. Z-scores were inverted for tests scored on speed). The NPZ-8 average is comprised of 8 data points from 6 tests: timed gait, WAIS symbol-digit, grooved pegboard dominant &amp; non-dominant, CalCAP Choice &amp; Sequential reaction times, and the Trail-making Test parts A &amp; B. Raw scores were transformed to Z-scores for each test and then averaged to calculate the NPZ-8 score at each visit (Z-scores +/-3.5 standard deviations from mean limited to +/-3.5). Positive change in NPZ-8 from baseline to Week 24 indicated improved performance and negative change indicated worse performance.</description>

        <description>Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), change in whole brain fractional anisotropy (FA) between baseline and 24 weeks. FA is a unitless index that is used for measuring diffusion asymmetry. FA values range from 0 to 1 (0 equals no anisotropy; greater anisotropy is indicated by higher FA values approaching the maximum of 1). FA was measured in regions of interest (ROI) automatically generated by the multi-atlas label-fusion method implemented in the MRICloud.
