  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In current, clinical ophthalmology, a range of specialised testing allows comprehensive&#xD;
      evaluation of ocular health. These tests have typically evolved over many years to ensure&#xD;
      their clinical validity. For example, the assessment of visual acuity has traditionally been&#xD;
      measured with Snellen letter charts from a distance of six metres (20 feet), leading to the&#xD;
      phrase &quot;20/20 vision&quot;. Despite this, the limitations of Snellen testing are well established&#xD;
      and more sophisticated testing is now available (e.g., logMAR testing using ETDRS (Early&#xD;
      Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study) charts). Many other diagnostic tests have undergone&#xD;
      similar cycles of refinement, often over extended time periods. Therefore, it should be&#xD;
      incumbent on any new device to undergo detailed evaluation of its validity (how its&#xD;
      measurements agree with other testing) and its repeatability (the variability when a further&#xD;
      measurement is obtained in short time period, by the same operator and under the same&#xD;
      conditions).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Binocular OCT extends the application of OCT devices beyond that of simple, cross- sectional&#xD;
      imaging to a diverse array of diagnostic tests. The binocular design also removes the need&#xD;
      for additional personnel to perform testing (i.e., the device can be self-operated in an&#xD;
      automated manner), and allows for novel testing to be performed that is not possible with&#xD;
      monocular imaging. In particular, binocular OCT devices have the potential to perform&#xD;
      automated, quantitative pupillary measurements - an entirely novel application for this&#xD;
      imaging modality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will assess the validity and repeatability of pupil measurements using binocular&#xD;
      OCT.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Binocular OCT has the potential to allow for objective, quantitative measurement of pupillary&#xD;
      reflexes, that can be performed in a fast, safe, and automated manner. Importantly, binocular&#xD;
      OCT pupillometry can be performed alongside binocular retinal OCT imaging in a single testing&#xD;
      session, in an automated manner (imaging of the retina using OCT is the commonest ophthalmic&#xD;
      imaging procedure worldwide - in 2011, it is estimated that more than 20 million retinal OCT&#xD;
      images were obtained, more than the sum of all other ophthalmic imaging procedures combined).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of pupillary reflexes is an essential component of a comprehensive ocular&#xD;
      examination. In patients with visual loss, for example, detection of an RAPD often indicates&#xD;
      the presence of serious ophthalmic diseases, such as optic neuropathies or severe retinal&#xD;
      disease. As such, RAPD testing is essential as a screening test in the assessment of patients&#xD;
      with less serious conditions such as cataract.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RAPD testing is commonly performed using the swinging flashlight method (SFM). A positive SFM&#xD;
      test suggests the presence of asymmetric damage involving the afferent limb of the pupillary&#xD;
      light reflex pathway. The SFM is a qualitative test, and relies upon visualising no pupillary&#xD;
      constriction or immediate or delayed pupillary dilation; if either of these responses is&#xD;
      observed, an RAPD is believed to be present. The SFM requires a trained examiner and many&#xD;
      potential sources of error may confound the results, including anisocoria, off-axis pupil&#xD;
      illumination, and unequal retinal bleaching. Pupil abnormalities may be subtle and easily&#xD;
      missed using the SFM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Automated pupilometers allow examiners to precisely and objectively quantify the pupillary&#xD;
      response to light by measuring parameters such as minimum and maximum pupil diameter, the&#xD;
      amplitude of constriction, latency of constriction, velocity of constriction, and duration of&#xD;
      maximum constriction. Dedicated pupillometry devices are commercially available and have been&#xD;
      shown to be highly sensitive and specific for RAPD detection e.g. RAPDx; Konan Medical USA,&#xD;
      Inc., Irvine, CA. These devices are also capable of detecting the presence of more subtle&#xD;
      RAPD, typically not found using the SFM, in diseases such as glaucoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, automated pupilometers such as the Konan RAPDx system are not widely used in&#xD;
      clinical practice. This is largely because they are expensive devices, limited to a single&#xD;
      purpose. A binocular OCT system that could perform both automated pupillometry and retinal&#xD;
      OCT imaging would thus have great clinical utility.&#xD;
