  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is an investigator-initiated trial comparing two different catheters (standard&#xD;
      versus ultrasound assisted) for the treatment of acute high risk pulmonary embolism (blood&#xD;
      clots in lung arteries with evidence or heart strain). Patients already planned for the&#xD;
      procedure will be randomized to standard catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) or to&#xD;
      ultrasound-assisted catheter thrombolysis (USAT). Both catheters are currently used routinely&#xD;
      in practice for the treatment of pulmonary embolism, but it is not known if USAT is superior&#xD;
      to standard CDT, the former being much more expensive and more commonly used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to learn about which catheter-directed therapy is more suitable&#xD;
      for patients with pulmonary embolism (PE), who are candidates for both standard catheter&#xD;
      directed therapy (CDT), and ultrasound-assisted catheter directed therapy (USAT), and to&#xD;
      provide information regarding the cost effectiveness of the two different types of treatment.&#xD;
      A total of 80 patients are planned to be recruited. All medication administration, procedures&#xD;
      or in-hospital tests will be performed as routine clinical practice. The study will compare&#xD;
      short term and long term outcomes: resolution of blood clots on CT scan, right ventricular&#xD;
      size improvement, quality of life and symptoms at 3 and 12 months, and cost effectiveness.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) accounts for 5-10% of in-hospital deaths. Systemic&#xD;
      anticoagulation (AC) is the standard of care and thrombolysis is recommended for those at a&#xD;
      higher mortality risk. Catheter-directed therapies, mainly standard catheter-directed&#xD;
      thrombolysis (CDT) and ultrasound-accelerated thrombolysis (USAT), have been introduced as&#xD;
      new, more effective, and safer treatment modalities. USAT is a modification of standard&#xD;
      catheter thrombolysis, utilizing a system of local ultrasound to dissociate the fibrin matrix&#xD;
      of the thrombus, allowing deeper penetration of lytics. However, there is limited data&#xD;
      comparing the two treatments. More rapid clearance of pulmonary thrombus by USAT compared to&#xD;
      standard CDT may prove to be more effective regarding clinical outcomes and cost (e.g. via&#xD;
      reduced length of ICU and hospital stay). Alternatively, if thrombus clearance is similar,&#xD;
      the cost of USAT may exceed the cost of CDT (equipment and disposables), without offering any&#xD;
      potential advantage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This controlled, randomized study seeks to determine if ultrasound acceleration adds any&#xD;
      benefits in the outcomes and costs of catheter-directed thrombolysis for patients with acute&#xD;
      submassive PE. The treatment with CDT or USAT are standard of care for submassive PE and&#xD;
      participants will be randomized to receive one treatment or the other. Participants will have&#xD;
      follow up visits at 3 months and 12 months post procedure. All the procedures, tests, and&#xD;
      follow up visits are according to current standard of care.&#xD;

    <description>Quality of life after pulmonary embolism (PEmb QoL) questionnaire is a 40 item survey asking respondents about their lung symptoms after having a pulmonary embolism. Participants report on 6 dimensions which cover the frequency and intensity of lung symptoms, physical and social limitations due to symptoms, pain, and emotional distress following having a pulmonary embolism. Scoring the responses involves specific instructions to reverse the scores for several dimensions, resulting in a score between 0 and 100 where 0 corresponds with &quot;no complaints&quot; and 100 is &quot;worst possible&quot; outcome.</description>

    <description>The University of California San Diego (UCSD) Medical Center Shortness of Breath Questionnaire is a 24 item survey asking respondents how much shortness of breath they experience doing particular activities. Breathlessness is rated on a scale of 0 (not at all breathless) to 5 (maximally breathless or unable to do an activity become of breathlessness). Total scores range from 0 to 120, with higher scores indicating increased shortness of breath.</description>

    <measure>Cost effectiveness analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>A Markov state-transition, cost effectiveness model will be created to simulate patient oriented outcomes assuming a societal perspective with a 12-month time horizon. All point estimates for model parameters will be determined from the prospectively collected data. Quality adjusted life years will be determined for each therapy based on survival, freedom from major adverse events, discharge status, functional status, and quality of life measures. Costs will be calculated for each therapy based on in-hospital resource utilization (i.e., length of stay in the ICU, operating room and procedure costs, and associated adverse event costs) and out-of-hospital costs (outpatient nursing care, loss of work, outpatient testing and follow-up).</description>

    <description>Catheter-directed thrombolysis requires placement of a multi-sidehole infusion catheter within the pulmonary arterial thrombus burden, under angiographic guidance. Thrombolytic medications are slowly infused through the catheter, which is left in place for the duration of the treatment.
