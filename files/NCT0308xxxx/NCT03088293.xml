  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Infliximab versus Cyclophosphamide in&#xD;
      Subjects with Idiopathic Refractory Scleritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The term scleritis describes a chronic inflammation that involves the outermost cost and&#xD;
      skeleton of the eye. Scleritis is classified anatomically as either anterior or posterior&#xD;
      based on the principal location of the inflammation. Thirty to forty percent of scleritis&#xD;
      cases are associated with systemic autoimmune conditions including rheumatoid arthritis and&#xD;
      granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Infectious causes including herpes virus and varicella&#xD;
      zoster account for 5 to 10% of patients. The remaining 50% of cases are classified as&#xD;
      idiopathic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CIRIS, is the first prospective randomized, head to head study, comparing infliximab to&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide in refractory idiopathic scleritis. There is no firm evidence or randomized&#xD;
      controlled trials directly addressing the best biologic agent in severe and refractory&#xD;
      idiopathic scleritis. If left untreated or insufficiently treated, scleritis can progress to&#xD;
      peripheral ulcerative keratitis, uveitis and glaucoma. Visual loss occurs in approximately&#xD;
      10% of patients with anterior scleritis and in up to 75% of patients with posterior&#xD;
      scleritis. The incidence of burden in ocular inflammation (uveitis and scleritis) has been&#xD;
      dramatically reduced in the recent years with the use of biologics, raising the question of&#xD;
      whether these compounds should be used earlier in the treatment of severe non infectious&#xD;
      scleritis. Contrasting with other immunosuppressors, cyclophosphamide and infliximab act&#xD;
      rapidly and are highly effective in steroid's sparing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite a strong rationale, these compounds are not yet approved in idiopathic refractory&#xD;
      scleritis, which guarantees the innovative nature of this study that aims selecting or&#xD;
      dropping any arm when evidence of efficacy already exists.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Provide written informed consent prior to the performance of any study-specific&#xD;
             procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Male or female, subject aged &gt; or = 18 at Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Weight 40 - 120 kg at Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Diagnosis of anterior idiopathic scleritis or anterior and posterior idiopathic&#xD;
             scleritis at least one eye. Scleritis is classified anatomically as anterior based on&#xD;
             the principal location of the inflammation. Clinically, anterior scleritis can be&#xD;
             divided into diffuse, nodular or necrotizing types.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Active disease: Currently uncontrolled scleritis disease. Uncontrolled scleritis&#xD;
             disease is defined as (at least) a 2 in sclera inflammation, according to the grading&#xD;
             system defined by Sene for sclera inflammation (gradings from 0 to 4).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Refractory disease: At screening, subjects must be receiving oral corticosteroids (&gt;10&#xD;
             mg/day prednisone equivalent and &lt;80 mg/day) and at least one other immunosuppressive&#xD;
             for more than 4 months (azathioprine, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetyl,&#xD;
             cyclosporine, leflunomide) or be intolerant to such immunosuppressive therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Topical corticosteroids and/or NSAIDs are permitted provided the dose regimen has been&#xD;
             stable for 2 weeks prior to Screening and remains stable throughout the study. Topical&#xD;
             treatment for cycloplegia is permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Page 40 sur 129&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Chest X-ray results (postero-anterior and lateral) within 12 weeks prior to the&#xD;
             randomization visit with no evidence of active Tuberculosis, active infection, or&#xD;
             malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. For female subjects of child-bearing age, a negative serum pregnancy test. A woman is&#xD;
             considered of childbearing potential, i.e. fertile, following menarche and until&#xD;
             becoming post-menopausal unless permanently sterile. Permanent sterilisation methods&#xD;
             include hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy and bilateral oophorectomy. A&#xD;
             postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative&#xD;
             medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal&#xD;
             range may be used to confirm a post-menopausal state in women not using hormonal&#xD;
             contraception or hormonal replacement therapy. However in the absence of 12 months of&#xD;
             amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient (definition of the Clinical Trial&#xD;
             Facilitation Group).&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. For subjects with reproductive potential, a willingness to use adequate contraceptive&#xD;
             measures to prevent the subject or the subject's partner from becoming pregnant during&#xD;
             the study. For women in period of childbearing adequate contraceptive measures include&#xD;
             hormonal methods used for two or more cycles prior to Screening and 6 months after the&#xD;
             last dose treatment should be used (e.g., oral contraceptive pills, contraceptive&#xD;
             patch, or contraceptive vaginal ring), barrier methods (e.g., contraceptive sponge,&#xD;
             diaphragm used in conjunction with contraceptive foam or jelly, or condom used in&#xD;
             conjunction with contraceptive foam or jelly), intrauterine devices (IUD),&#xD;
             sterilization (e.g., tubal ligation or a monogamous relationship with a vasectomized&#xD;
             partner), and abstinence. For men who are sexually active with a women in period of&#xD;
             childbearing adequate contraceptive measures from screening to 6 months after the last&#xD;
             dose treatment should be used (For men: barrier methods (condom used in conjunction&#xD;
             with contraceptive foam or jelly), sterilization (vasectomy) and abstinence. For his&#xD;
             partner: hormonal methods (e.g., oral contraceptive pills, contraceptive patch, or&#xD;
             contraceptive vaginal ring), barrier methods (e.g., contraceptive sponge, diaphragm&#xD;
             used in conjunction with contraceptive foam or jelly), intrauterine devices (IUD),&#xD;
             sterilization (e.g., tubal ligation)).&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. A negative QuantiFERON®-Tuberculosis (TB) test result or, in the event that their&#xD;
             QuantiFERON®-TB test result at Screening is positive, all subjects must agree to&#xD;
             complete an INH treatment course of at least 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
