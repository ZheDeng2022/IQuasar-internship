  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Musculoskeletal pain is highly prevalent, disabling, and with high socio-economic costs, with&#xD;
      many negative effects on quality of life. It affects the ability to perform work, social,&#xD;
      recreational and domestic tasks, changing the mood and concentration of this population.&#xD;
      Despite the worldwide prevalence and socioeconomic burden of this condition, a clear&#xD;
      understanding of its etiology and pathogenesis remains elusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i) to analyze the possible level of association between fear of pain, fear of movement,&#xD;
      self-efficacy, and pain acceptance on pain-disability at the start of the study and&#xD;
      prospectively evaluate its role as a risk factor; (ii) to evaluate the possible role as a&#xD;
      prognostic factor of fear of pain, fear of movement, self-efficacy and pain acceptance in&#xD;
      those who develop musculoskeletal pain at follow-up; (iii) explore the possible mediating&#xD;
      power of fear of movement and self-efficacy in the relationship between pain-disability; (iv)&#xD;
      investigate what percentage of the variance accounts for beliefs (fear of pain, fear of&#xD;
      movement, self-efficacy, and acceptance of pain) in predicting the onset and / or maintenance&#xD;
      of musculoskeletal pain.&#xD;

      The present study will be a prospective observational study of 4 years that will be carried&#xD;
      out between September 2017 and September 2020 at the University of Malaga. Several&#xD;
      questionnaires assessing different beliefs associated with pain will be administered to&#xD;
      participants. The results will be evaluated at baseline (t1) and in 4 follow-ups (at 12 (t2),&#xD;
      24 (t3), 36 (t4) and 48 (t5) months. It will be implemented and reported in line with the&#xD;
      SPIRIT statement and the STROBE guidance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants A consecutive sample of healthy male and female students, students of the&#xD;
      University of Málaga, will be recruited. Research assistants trained by the principal&#xD;
      investigator will be in charge of carrying out the recruitment and evaluating the&#xD;
      participants for their eligibility. Participants who meet the inclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      invited to participate in this study, and then evaluated at baseline and at 12, 24, 36 and 48&#xD;
      months of follow-up. The inclusion criteria are as follows: (i) men / women over 18 years;&#xD;
      (ii) students of the University of Málaga belonging to one of the disciplines previously&#xD;
      mentioned. The exclusion criteria are as follows: (i) participants currently experiencing&#xD;
      musculoskeletal pain; (ii) participants currently taking medication; (iii) previous histories&#xD;
      of musculoskeletal surgery; (Iv) inability to provide written informed consent and / or&#xD;
      complete questionnaires.&#xD;

    <description>Pain: The Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) will assess the pain intensity of each patient at baseline and prospectively. NRS scores range from 0 to 10, with 0 without pain and 10 with the worst pain imaginable. It has been shown that the NRS has a good test-retest reliability of the same day.</description>
