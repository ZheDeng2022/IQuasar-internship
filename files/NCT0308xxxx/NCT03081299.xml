      This is a two institution (Naval Medical Center San Diego and Walter Reed National Military&#xD;
      Medical Center) prospective descriptive correlational design looking to characterize&#xD;
      postoperative pain variables across various procedures that historically have significant&#xD;
      levels of persistent post-surgical pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total goal of 1500 subjects (750 subjects at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center&#xD;
      and 750 subjects at Naval Medical Center San Diego) will be queried regarding their&#xD;
      postoperative pain experience following mastectomy, thoracic surgery, total knee&#xD;
      arthroplasty, total hip arthroplasty, spinal fusion, and major abdominal surgery. Descriptive&#xD;
      multidimensional tools (the Defense and Veterans Pain Rating Scale (DVPRS) and the electronic&#xD;
      Pain Assessment Screening Tool and Outcomes Registry (PASTOR) will be used preoperatively, as&#xD;
      an inpatient, and up to 6 months postoperatively.&#xD;

    <measure>DVPRS</measure>
    <time_frame>perioperatively to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>To determine how predictive PASTOR/PROMIS measures are for moderate to severe acute postoperative pain as measured by the DVPRS within the first 48 hours postoperatively for all surgical groups and between surgical groups.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>PASTOR/PROMIS</measure>
    <time_frame>perioperatively to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>To assess any predictive/correlative capability of early postoperative PASTOR/PROMIS measures (7 days,14 days, and 1 month postoperatively) in the prediction of persistent pain at 3 and 6 months for all surgical groups and between surgical groups</description>

    <description>To describe various pain phenotypes via multidimensional pain measures throughout the subacute (7 days to 6 months) perioperative period. This description will focus on certain time points but also how such measures change over time (ie pain trajectories)</description>
