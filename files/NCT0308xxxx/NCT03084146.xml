  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psoriasis is a common chronic skin disorder that affects over 4 million people. There is no&#xD;
      cure for psoriasis and treatment is directed at controlling patients' symptoms. The purpose&#xD;
      of this study is to determine whether psoriasis patients are more likely to have food&#xD;
      sensitivities than those patients without psoriasis. We will also determine if eliminating&#xD;
      certain foods from the diet results in a change in psoriasis symptoms.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Purpose: To determine the role of food sensitivity in psoriasis and assess the clinical&#xD;
      response of an individualized elimination diet on psoriasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Up to 50 volunteers with psoriasis and 20 age- and sex-matched controls will be&#xD;
      recruited for a 12-week prospective correlational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Venous blood samples for the detection of antibodies against food antigens will be&#xD;
      collected and individualized elimination diets will be designed based on the most reactive&#xD;
      food antigens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments: Clinical assessments of objective and subjective parameters will be measured&#xD;
      using Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI), Static Physicians Global Assessment (sPGA),&#xD;
      Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), and Itch Numeric Rating Scale (Itch NRS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The primary objectives are to determine whether psoriasis patients are more&#xD;
      likely to have food sensitivities and assess the clinical response of a 12-week elimination&#xD;
      diet on psoriasis.&#xD;
