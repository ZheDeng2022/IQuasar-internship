      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and tolerability of this treatment&#xD;
      combination of paclitaxel and trametinib. Additionally, this study aims to to find out what&#xD;
      effects the combination of paclitaxel and trametinib has on the shrinkage and growth of&#xD;
      anaplastic thyroid cancer.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Have a known immediate or delayed hypersensitivity reaction or idiosyncrasy to taxanes&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Current use of a prohibited medication. The following medications or non-drug&#xD;
             therapies are prohibited:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Concurrent treatment with bisphosphonates is permitted; however, treatment must&#xD;
                  be initiated prior to the first dose of study therapy. Prophylactic use of&#xD;
                  bisphosphonates in patients without bone disease is not permitted, except for the&#xD;
                  treatment of osteoporosis&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Because the composition, PK, and metabolism of many herbal supplements are&#xD;
