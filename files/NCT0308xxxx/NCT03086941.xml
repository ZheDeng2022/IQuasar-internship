      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A supraglottic airway device is designed to maintain a clear airway while sitting above, and&#xD;
      creating a seal around the larynx. It may be used in elective surgery, as an airway rescue&#xD;
      device in failed tracheal intubation, as a conduit for tracheal intubation, or in emergencies&#xD;
      such as cardiorespiratory arrest, both in and out of hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      'First-generation'supraglottic airway devices are simple airway tubes such as the laryngeal&#xD;
      mask airway (LMA) Classic. 'Second generation' devices contain suction ports and integral&#xD;
      bite blocks, these include the LMA Proseal and the i-gel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The I-gel is the innovate second generation supraglottic airway and it is considered the&#xD;
      first major development since LMA. The I-gel has changed the face of airway management and is&#xD;
      now widely used in anesthesia and resuscitation across the globe. It is made from a medical&#xD;
      grade thermoplastic elastomer and it is designed to create a non-inflatable, anatomical seal&#xD;
      of the pharyngeal, laryngeal and perilaryngeal structures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pediatrics are not small adults, there are a number of anatomical differences which make&#xD;
      airway management difficult than adults. Predicatably, these differences are most pronounced&#xD;
      at birth and the most unfamiliar(non-adult like) airway is encountered in neonates and&#xD;
      infants under 1 year of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the work&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare between use of I-gel as a conduit for blind intubation and as a conduit for&#xD;
      fiberoptic guided intubation in children and also aim to validate the use of I-gel as conduit&#xD;
      for blind intubation in absence of fiberoptic or lack of experience of its use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To validate I-gel use as blind intubating conduit in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To Estimate the duration of blind intubation using I-gel and duration of fiberoptic&#xD;
           guided intubation through I-gel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Considerations&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study protocol will be approved by the Research Ethics Committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective randomized controlled trial (non inferiority design)&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Study setting and location&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in Children Hospital of Cairo University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Study population&#xD;
&#xD;
      This Study will be conducted on 88 children aged from one to ten years presented for elective&#xD;
      surgical procedure at Children Hospital of Cairo University. Patient will be divided into two&#xD;
      equal groups; group C control group (n=44) and group B (blind) (n=44).&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Study Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Randomization (in RCT only) Once enrolled in the study, patients will be randomly&#xD;
           assigned into two groups; fiberoptic guided (control) group (Group C: n= 44), blind&#xD;
           group (Group B: n=44). Randomization will be done using computer generated number and&#xD;
           concealed using sequentially numbered, sealed opaque envelope.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study Protocol Randomization will be done by computer generated numbers and concealed by&#xD;
           serially numbered, opague and sealed envelopes. The details of the series will be&#xD;
           unknown to the investigators and the group assignment will be kept in asset of sealed&#xD;
           envelopes each bearing only the case number on the outside. Prior to surgery the&#xD;
           appropriate numbered envelopes will be opened by the nurse, the card inside will&#xD;
           determine the patient group.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All children will be premedicated with oral midazolam 0.5mg/kg Half hour before&#xD;
           procedure and atropine at a dose of 0.02mg/kg (IM). Continuous electrocardiogram (ECG),&#xD;
           pulse oximetry, non-invasive arterial blood pressure, and temperature monitoring will be&#xD;
           applied and all patients will be induced with inhalational anesthetic using Sevoflurane&#xD;
           + oxygen (O2) and I.V line will be inserted. After deepening of the anesthesia, fentanyl&#xD;
           1Î¼g/kg, and muscle relaxant will be given in the form of atracurium 0.5mg/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The absence of mydriasis, divergent gaze, haemodynamic or motor response to the jaw&#xD;
           thrust manoeuvre will be used as parameters to guide adequate depth of anesthesia(7).&#xD;
           Supraglottic I-gel of appropriate size (according to body wight) will be inserted after&#xD;
           lubrication with K-Y Lubricating Jelly (Johnson &amp; Johnson Medical Limited, Gargrave,&#xD;
           Skipton, UK). Air way manoeuvres like jaw thrust or head tilt will be used to facilitate&#xD;
           insertion.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Adequate ventilation will be confirmed by adequate chest expansion and capnography&#xD;
           waveform. If ventilation is adequate, the SG I-gel will be secured. In case of&#xD;
           inadequate ventilation after I-gel insertion, airway manoeuvres like adjusting head/neck&#xD;
           position and changing depth of insertion can be used to improve ventilation.A maximum of&#xD;
           three SGA insertion attempts will be allowed then conventional laryngoscopic intubation&#xD;
           will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           After securing SG I-gel, according to patients group; in group C (control), a paediatric&#xD;
           fibrescope will be primed with an appropriate size tracheal tube. The fibrescope will be&#xD;
           introduced through I-gel and guide tracheal intubation. After insertion of tube and&#xD;
           confirmation of position, the fiberscope will be removed&#xD;
&#xD;
           In group B (blind); an appropriate size endotracheal tube will be introduced through&#xD;
           I-gel blindly. Only smooth intubation without force together with manoeuvres necessary&#xD;
           to correct the position of tracheal tube will be allowed. Only one attempt of blind&#xD;
           intubation is allowed to avoid airway injury. Any resistance to first attempt tube&#xD;
           insertion will indicate failure of blind tube insertion.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In both groups, a second person will stabilise the SG I-gel in the set position in order&#xD;
           to prevent unintentional movement during the intubation procedure and removal of I-gel.&#xD;
           Tube insertion will be confirmed by capnography, fibrescope and bilateral air entry by&#xD;
           auscultation after connection of breathing circuit. To remove the SG I-gel after&#xD;
           successful intubation, the breathing circuit will be disconnected, and the I-gel will be&#xD;
           withdrawn with the aid of a stylet (stabilizer) in a continuous push-pull movement. If&#xD;
           saturation fall below 92%, or if facemask ventilation or ventilation via the SGA begin&#xD;
           to fail, this indicate securing airway with conventional intubation&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Measurement tools&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients demographic data will be collected; age, gender, weight, height and type&#xD;
                of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The success rate and number of attempts of SG I-gel insertion will be recorded and&#xD;
                the time taken for insertion from removal of face mask until appearance of&#xD;
                end-tidal CO2 on the monitor after connection of the breathing circuit to the SG&#xD;
                I-gel.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The success rate of first attempt intubation and time taken for tube insertion from&#xD;
                start of tube introduction till appearance of appearance of end-tidal CO2 on the&#xD;
                monitor after connection of the breathing circuit to the tube will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Adverse events will be recorded ; suspicion of aspiration or regurgitation,&#xD;
                hypoxia, bronchospasm, laryngospasm and coughing. Staining of blood on the SG I-gel&#xD;
                will be recorded, as well as dental, tongue or lip trauma.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Postoperative dysphagia, sore throat and hoarseness of voice will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
