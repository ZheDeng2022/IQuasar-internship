  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oral magnesium supplementation has been widely used in the treatment of muscle cramps. Muscle&#xD;
      cramps are common in dialysis patients but are not satisfactorily prevented by oral&#xD;
      magnesium. Transdermal administration of magnesium has been promoted as a potential treatment&#xD;
      for muscle cramps but this has not been investigated rigorously. We aim to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of transdermal magnesium supplementation in reducing cramp frequency and&#xD;
      severity. We will recruit current haemodialysis patients who suffer from muscle cramps into a&#xD;
      randomised, placebo-controlled, cross-over design trial. Each intervention period will last 8&#xD;
      weeks with a 4-week washout period in between. We will measure muscle cramp frequency,&#xD;
      duration and severity as the primary outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Study participants will be provided with a cramp diary in which they will record the date,&#xD;
      time, duration and severity of any muscle cramps they experience. Severity will be measured&#xD;
      using a Likert scale in which participants will be asked to mark along a 10 cm line the&#xD;
      severity of the pain they have experienced with each muscle cramp (ranging from no pain to&#xD;
      the worst pain possible). The distance between &quot;no pain&quot; and the participant's mark will then&#xD;
      be measured in centimetres (to one decimal point) to provide a precise value for muscle cramp&#xD;
      severity. Participants will also be asked to record the duration of each muscle cramp they&#xD;
      experience to the nearest minute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be asked to record in their cramp diaries the nature of any unwanted skin&#xD;
      changes they may have experienced during their participation in the study including when they&#xD;
      first noticed these changes and the duration in which they were affected by them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum magnesium, calcium and potassium levels will be measured and recorded before&#xD;
      commencement of the study, at the end of the first stage of the study, at the end of the&#xD;
      washout out period and at the end of the second stage of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will also be asked to describe their restless leg symptoms at different periods of&#xD;
      the study from - no different to usual, better, much better, worse, much worse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be seen by the investigators at enrolment into the study and at the end of&#xD;
      the run-in period, first treatment period and second treatment period. In addition,&#xD;
      participants will be asked to fill in a Likert scale regarding their views on how effective&#xD;
      they believe the treatments were after each treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.2 Study Plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the run-in period patients will make no changes to their treatments for their muscle&#xD;
      cramps. During the treatment periods patients will be asked to apply five sprays of the&#xD;
      intervention or placebo to the two sites of the body most commonly affected by muscle cramps,&#xD;
      twice daily. During the two-week wash-out period there will be no spray applied.&#xD;
