      The purpose of this study is describe the safety and single-dose pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      rectally-administered IQP (ImQuest Pharmaceuticals)-0528 (DuoGel) in plasma, rectal tissue&#xD;
      biopsies, vaginal tissue biopsies, rectal fluid and cervicovaginal fluid as well as to assess&#xD;
      the luminal distribution of IQP-0528 in the rectum. Sixteen healthy volunteers will receive a&#xD;
      single rectal dose of DuoGel, followed by blood, tissue and fluid sampling over the following&#xD;
      72 hours.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1 open label study of the safety, PK, and PD of single-dose 10 mL IQP-0528&#xD;
      through rectal administration. Pharmacokinetics (PK) will be assessed in multiple&#xD;
      compartments: plasma, rectal tissue, vaginal tissue, rectal fluid and cervicovaginal fluid.&#xD;
      The luminal distribution of DuoGel in the rectum will be evaluated with Single Photon&#xD;
      Emission Computed Tomography/ X-ray Computed Tomography (SPECT/CT). Pharmacodynamics (PD)&#xD;
      will be assessed in an ex vivo HIV explant challenge of rectal and vaginal tissue biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completing the screening evaluation (Visit 1) and establishing participant eligibility,&#xD;
      16 eligible participants will be enrolled: 8 men and 8 women. A subsequent baseline visit&#xD;
      (Visit 2) safety assessment and tissue ex vivo HIV explant challenge will be performed as&#xD;
      baseline for comparison with later post-drug evaluation. Participants will receive a single&#xD;
      10 mL rectal dose of 99mTechnetium (99mTc) -radiolabelled DuoGel (Visit 3), followed by&#xD;
      safety assessments and PK and PD sampling over three days (Visits 3, 4, and 5). Finally, a&#xD;
      follow-up safety phone call is performed a week after all PK sampling and biopsies are&#xD;
      collected.&#xD;
