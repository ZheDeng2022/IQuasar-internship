  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes has been recognised as an epidemic globally and within the EU. Environmental and&#xD;
      behavioural changes over the last century, such as a sedentary lifestyle, intake of calorie&#xD;
      dense/sugary foods and obesity are all significant contributors in creating a dramatic&#xD;
      increase in the incidence of diabetes globally. There are about 60 million people, 11% of the&#xD;
      total population, with diabetes in the European Region. This number will swell to 15% of the&#xD;
      EU population by 2030. Europe spent â‚¬89 billion on directly treating and managing diabetes&#xD;
      and its related complications in 2011. This cost however is severely understated as the true&#xD;
      cost of diabetes also includes indirect costs, such as productivity losses due to lost&#xD;
      working time through absenteeism, sickness, early retirement and premature death. The WHO&#xD;
      projects that diabetes will be the 7th leading cause of death in 2030 and it is already the&#xD;
      fourth in most developed countries in the world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, individuals with diabetes are twice as likely to be admitted to hospital.&#xD;
      According to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), diabetes is the number one cause&#xD;
      for admission to dialysis and to kidney transplant programmes and is the leading cause of&#xD;
      working age blindness. It also accounts for a risk of lower limb amputation of 10 to 12%.&#xD;
      Therefore, it is clear that diabetes has a huge and growing impact on individual sufferers as&#xD;
      well as placing a huge strain on the health system and the exchequers that have to fund them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      90% of diabetes patients globally have type 2 diabetes and when we refer to diabetes in the&#xD;
      document going forward it is type 2 to which we refer. This chronic disease state occurs when&#xD;
      the body does not use insulin properly causing glucose levels in the blood to rise higher&#xD;
      than normal. This abnormal state over time leads to serious damage to the heart, blood&#xD;
      vessels, eyes, kidneys, and nerves. Prediabetic individuals are defined as having blood sugar&#xD;
      levels higher than normal but not yet high enough to be classified as Diabetes, and&#xD;
      prediabetes is thought of as a clear, early warning sign for diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Without intervention, prediabetes is likely to become type 2 diabetes in 10 years or less.&#xD;
      The increasing number of new cases of prediabetes presents a global concern as it carries&#xD;
      large-scale implications towards the future burden on healthcare. Between 2003 and 2011, the&#xD;
      prevalence of prediabetes in England alone more than tripled, with 35.3% of the adult&#xD;
      population, or 1 in every 3 people, having prediabetes. The International Journal of health&#xD;
      science succinctly states a well-accepted fact: &quot;intervention prior to the onset of type 2&#xD;
      diabetes may be the only way of preventing the complications of diabetes&quot;. In addition,&#xD;
      diabetes once it occurs is irreversible, thus prevention holds a last beacon for epidemic&#xD;
      control in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whilst significant lifestyle changes can be impactful, sustained compliance is very limited&#xD;
      and therefore results are poor. As a result, the European Commission has highlighted&#xD;
      functional foods as valuable solutions for treatment and prevention of diabetes. A functional&#xD;
      food, &quot;beneficially affects one or more target functions in the body beyond adequate&#xD;
      nutritional effects in a way that is relevant to either an improved state of health and&#xD;
      well-being and/or reduction of risk of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peptides derived from a range of food materials have been shown to prevent disease i.e.&#xD;
      inflammatory disorders [1] osteoporosis [2] high blood pressure [3] or promote health i.e.&#xD;
      immunomodulatory [4], antimicrobial [5], anti-oxidative [6], antithrombotic [7],&#xD;
      hypo-cholesterolemic [8] activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peptides are protein molecules smaller than 10 kDa that may exist naturally or be derived&#xD;
      from full length proteins. Bioactive peptides are defined as specific protein fragments that&#xD;
      have positive effects on body functions or conditions and may influence human health [9].&#xD;
      Peptides are produced by hydrolysis of food materials by digestive, microbial, and plant&#xD;
      proteolytic enzymes, their levels generally increase during food fermentation [10]. Bioactive&#xD;
      peptides with particular amino-acid sequences, which are inactive in the intact protein&#xD;
      molecule become bioactive after their release from the intact molecule through the action of&#xD;
      digestive enzymes in the body or through the action of proteolytic enzymes in food&#xD;
      processing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plant hydrolysates have been shown to display a stimulatory effect on the insulin responsive&#xD;
      glucose transport protein, GLUT4, which facilitates glucose transport into skeletal muscle.&#xD;
      Skeletal muscle is the predominant site of glucose disposal (80%) under insulin-stimulated or&#xD;
      post-prandial conditions and so it is hypothesized that one or both of the Nuritas pea and&#xD;
      rice protein hydrolysates could help reduce HbA1c levels in those with elevated HbA1c levels&#xD;
      (prediabetes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aims are to evaluate the effectiveness of three different daily doses of plant-based&#xD;
      hydrolysates versus placebo, when consumed over a 12-week period, at reducing and maintaining&#xD;
      glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels in a pre-diabetic population (otherwise healthy subjects&#xD;
      with impaired glucose metabolism), as well as post-prandial glucose/insulin levels (oral&#xD;
      glucose tolerance test), fructosamine levels, fasting plasma glucose levels, vital signs,&#xD;
      physical examinations, weight, blood pressure.&#xD;

                  agree to use an alternate method of contraception if they should become sexually&#xD;
                  active and will be queried on whether they have been abstinent in the preceding 2&#xD;
                  weeks when they present to the clinic for the Final Visit.) or, ii. has a male&#xD;
                  sexual partner who is surgically sterilized prior to the Screen Visit and is the&#xD;
                  only male sexual partner for that subject or, iii. sexual partner(s) is/are&#xD;
                  exclusively female or, iv. Oral contraceptives (either combined or progestogen&#xD;
                  only) with double-barrier method of contraception consisting of spermicide with&#xD;
                  either condom or diaphragm. (Women of child-bearing potential using an oral&#xD;
                  contraceptive in combination with a double-barrier method of contraception are&#xD;
                  required to continue to use this form of contraception for 1 week following&#xD;
                  discontinuation of study medication).&#xD;
&#xD;
                  v. Use of double-barrier contraception, specifically, a spermicide plus a&#xD;
                  mechanical barrier (e.g. male condom, female diaphragm). The subject must be&#xD;
                  using this method for at least 1 week following the end of the study or, vi. Use&#xD;
                  of any intrauterine device (IUD) with published data showing that the highest&#xD;
                  expected failure rate is less than 1% per year. The subject must have the device&#xD;
                  inserted at least 2 weeks prior to the first Screen Visit, throughout the study,&#xD;
                  and 2 weeks following the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Participation in a clinical trial with an investigational product within 90 days&#xD;
             before screening, or plans to participate in another study during the study period,&#xD;
