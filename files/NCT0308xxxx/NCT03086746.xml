      To provide insight into why vitamin D levels at baseline predict an adverse outcome including&#xD;
      hospitalisation, we will establish whether baseline vitamin D levels are an independent&#xD;
      marker of LV remodelling in patients experiencing an ST segment elevation myocardial&#xD;
      infarction.&#xD;

      Participants Patients who have recently (&lt;72 hours) suffered an acute myocardial infarction&#xD;
      will be invited to participate. The immediate post-infarction period is one of particular&#xD;
      anxiety for patients and their carers and the project has been designed following advice from&#xD;
      Patient-Public-Involvement advisers and also after discussion of the project at the&#xD;
      Cardiovascular Clinical Research Facility PPI group meeting. Patient attendance will be kept&#xD;
      to a minimum and dovetail with clinical investigations wherever possible. In view of the&#xD;
      exploratory nature of the project, and the primary endpoint: left ventricular remodelling,&#xD;
      exclusion and inclusion criteria have been limited, preferring instead to capture a&#xD;
      real-world pragmatic view of changes in cardiac function following myocardial infarction.&#xD;
      This is also important when viewed in context of the long-term plan to investigate the&#xD;
      effects of vitamin D in ameliorating these adverse changes following a heart attack.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection, administration and imaging protocol Demographic and clinical variables will&#xD;
      be recorded on a bespoke database, which will also store biochemical information including&#xD;
      vitamin D, PTH and vitamin D binding protein levels measured in routine blood samples. EDTA&#xD;
      blood we will also be stored for analysis of vitamin D binding protein haplotypes. It is&#xD;
      thought that vitamin D does not exhibit an acute phase response so levels are stable&#xD;
      following a myocardial infarction. Each participant will undergo full bedside&#xD;
      echocardiography within 72 hours of an acute ST elevation myocardial infarction, the results&#xD;
      of which will be available for clinical use. European and American guidelines recommend&#xD;
      echocardiography prior to discharge for patients admitted with a STEMI, so this scan will not&#xD;
      be an extra procedure. The consent process will describe that the scan is clinically&#xD;
      indicated but will also be used for research purposes. As such this proposed study will&#xD;
      provide support for the clinical service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VINDICATE (vitamin D replenishment in patients with chronic heart failure) examined&#xD;
      remodelling and vitamin D over 12 months. Remodelling is expected to be accelerated in&#xD;
      patients experiencing an acute STEMI (a recent study of acute iron supplementation compared&#xD;
      scans at baseline and at three months) and indeed previous work describing the outcomes and&#xD;
      predictors of remodelling in 284 STEMI patients did so using repeat echocardiography at 6&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Full conventional echocardiography will be carried out with grey-scale and tissue Doppler&#xD;
      images recorded in the two and four chamber views using harmonics to improve border&#xD;
      definition if necessary. All images will be stored in the 'echopac' digital imaging system&#xD;
      and analysed offline. This analysis will include a calculation of LV end diastolic and end&#xD;
      systolic volumes using the real-time three dimensional data and two-dimensional biplane discs&#xD;
      (modified Simpson's) method by tracing the endocardial border excluding the papillary&#xD;
      muscles. An average of three measurements will be used in the final analysis. The frame at&#xD;
      the R-wave will be taken as end diastole, and the frame with the smallest LV cavity, as end&#xD;
      systole. The LV end-systolic volume index (LVESVi) will be calculated as LVESV/body surface&#xD;
      area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical considerations Study design and analysis plan have been developed with the help&#xD;
      of Dr David Cairns, Principal Statistician at the Leeds Clinical Trials Research Unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis plan Clinical and technical variables known to be of relevance to&#xD;
      outcomes in patients following myocardial infarction including pre-existing left ventricular&#xD;
      function, anaemia, age, female sex, diabetes mellitus, previous chronic kidney disease will&#xD;
      be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Change in left ventricular volume is a reliable surrogate of change in outcome. Two possible&#xD;
      markers of progressive remodelling will be analysed. The first will be to use the cut-off of&#xD;
      5% reduction in LVEF or a 15% increase in left ventricular end systolic volume index&#xD;
      (LVESVi), two variables which have been frequently used in the literature as a measure of&#xD;
      adverse remodeling. How changes in LVESVi and LVEF as continuous variables relate to the&#xD;
      baseline clinical data will also be explored. In this analysis we will follow the guidelines&#xD;
      described in STARD and TRIPOD statements to produce transparent and reproducible evidence&#xD;
      which relate clinical variables to markers of progressive remodeling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence, the initial approach will be to perform univariate tests of association (two sample&#xD;
      t-tests, one way analysis of variance and chi-squared tests) to look at the relationship&#xD;
      between the predictor variables of rhythm, past medical history (of ischaemic heart disease&#xD;
      and diabetes mellitus), pre-existing left ventricular function, location of myocardial&#xD;
      infarction, anaemia, age, female sex, previous chronic kidney disease and markers of&#xD;
      progressive remodelling. Around one quarter (25%) of all returning patients are expected to&#xD;
      fulfil the binary cut offs of &gt;5% reduction in LVEF or &gt;15% change in LVESVi. This will then&#xD;
      be further developed to construct robust multivariable predictive models based on a step-wise&#xD;
      logistic regression modelling procedure using bootstrap resampling to develop and internally&#xD;
      validate the model. This approach will require sufficient patients' data to reliably allow&#xD;
      regression models including all potentially relevant clinical variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size prediction It has been assumed that for each independent predictor under&#xD;
      investigation, there will need to be 10 'events' (&gt;5% reduction in LVEF). With nine predictor&#xD;
      variables, allowing for drop outs, withdrawal of consent or poor imaging, while recognising&#xD;
      that the predictor variables are not likely to be independent of one another, it has been&#xD;
      conservatively estimated that the study will need 90-100 subjects with 'events' (in this case&#xD;
      remodelling) to robustly estimate a model. Since conservatively estimates suggest that around&#xD;
      25% of patients will experience remodelling, 400 patients will be scanned at baseline and 6&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, around half of all patients presenting to Leeds with a STEMI come from other&#xD;
      districts and may not want to return to LTHT for an echocardiogram. It has therefore been&#xD;
      conservatively estimated that around 800 patients will need a scan to achieve 400 attendances&#xD;
      at follow-up. Leeds performs primary angioplasty (for STEMI) on around 1200 patients per year&#xD;
      such that allowing for weekends and refusals, there will be sufficient patients to complete&#xD;
      enrolment within two years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up and outcomes recording Outcomes data at one year, two years and five years&#xD;
      following the index event will be collected using routinely collected hospital admissions and&#xD;
      mortality data.&#xD;
