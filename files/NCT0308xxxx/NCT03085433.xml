  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial of couples with a history of poor embryo quality&#xD;
      undergoing a repeat in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycle for unexplained infertility. Couples&#xD;
      will be randomized to sperm selection by the clinical standard of centrifugation and&#xD;
      density-gradient processing compared to the microfluidic sperm sorting chip.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      More than 70 million couples worldwide are infertile and up to 40 million are actively&#xD;
      seeking infertility care. In the year 2013, a total of 160,521 assisted reproductive&#xD;
      technology (ART) procedures were performed in the United States. Isolation of motile and&#xD;
      morphologically normal sperm is an integral part of assisted reproduction. Traditional sperm&#xD;
      processing for assisted reproduction involves centrifugation and &quot;swim up&quot; techniques that&#xD;
      employ a density gradient to isolate motile sperm. This technique involves several steps of&#xD;
      centrifugation (200-1800g) with colloidal silica particles. In this process, sperm and other&#xD;
      material form distinct bands. It is thought that this procedure allows for elimination of&#xD;
      abnormal/immotile sperm as well as debris, thereby isolating motile human sperm.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, the centrifugation process has been shown to induce DNA damage and produce&#xD;
      reactive oxygen species, thereby potentially compromising sperm quality and subsequent&#xD;
      laboratory outcomes such as fertilization rate and embryo quality. Increased sperm DNA damage&#xD;
      has been associated with poor outcomes in assisted reproduction, including lower&#xD;
      fertilization rates, impaired embryo progression, and decreased pregnancy rates. The details&#xD;
      of the density gradient centrifugation process are not regulated by the FDA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In contrast, microfluidic-based sperm sorting has the capability of selectively isolating&#xD;
      highly motile, morphologically normal sperm with high DNA integrity from an unprocessed semen&#xD;
      sample. Microfluidic technology isolates healthy sperm by laminar flow, creating gradients&#xD;
      through channels. The microfluidic chip we plan to study in our randomized clinical trial&#xD;
      utilizes space-constrained microfluidic sorting to select highly motile and morphologically&#xD;
      normal sperm in a flow and chemical-free design. Unlike the standard of density gradient&#xD;
      centrifugation, no manipulation of sperm is required in this process. Raw semen is introduced&#xD;
      into the inflow and only motile and morphologically normal sperm are able to swim through the&#xD;
      chip to the outflow where it is collected for use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In semen samples from healthy male volunteers split into standard processing via&#xD;
      centrifugation and swim-up procedure compared with microfluidic sperm sorting, a&#xD;
      significantly higher percent motility and lower rate of sperm DNA fragmentation was detected&#xD;
      with microfluidic sperm sampling. The microfluidic sperm sorting technique has thus proven to&#xD;
      be an efficient and reliable means of sperm preparation compared with the centrifugation and&#xD;
      swim-up procedure. While this microfluidic chip has been used clinically in Mexico, Turkey,&#xD;
      South Africa, Italy, Greece, and Switzerland resulting in over 5,000 live births, its use in&#xD;
      clinical practice has not been rigorously studied. We aim to compare traditional preparation&#xD;
      and microfluidic sperm sorting on assisted reproductive technology outcomes including oocyte&#xD;
      fertilization and embryo quality in subjects with a history of poor embryo quality electing&#xD;
      to undergo a repeat in vitro fertilization cycle for infertility.&#xD;
