  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out which doses of talimogene laherparepvec (T-Vec) can&#xD;
      be given safely to participants with pancreatic cancer that is either too big to be taken out&#xD;
      by surgery or has spread to other parts of the body. The study will also see if T-Vec can&#xD;
      cause tumor shrinkage or prevent its growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to determine the rate of dose limiting toxicity at tested doses of&#xD;
      talimogene laherparepvec administered endoscopically to pancreatic tumors, and to identify a&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary exploratory efficacy endpoints include change in longest diameter in the injected&#xD;
      lesion(s), overall response rate (ORR) per RECIST v1.1 and modified immune-related response&#xD;
      criteria (mirRC as defined in section 11), progression free survival (PFS) and overall&#xD;
      survival (OS) at 6, 12, and 24 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is an area of great unmet need. PDA accounts for 90%&#xD;
      of pancreatic tumors in 2016. The standard of care for pancreas cancer is cytotoxic&#xD;
      chemotherapy, but this is not particularly effective with best response rates reported of&#xD;
      20-30% and no significant long-term 5-year survival for patients who are not surgical&#xD;
      candidates. Talimogene laherparepvec (previously known as OncoVEXGM-CSF) is an intratumorally&#xD;
      delivered oncolytic immunotherapy comprised of an immune-enhanced herpes simplex virus type-1&#xD;
      (HSV-1) that selectively replicates in solid tumors. Talimogene laherparepvec was the first&#xD;
      oncolytic viral therapy to be approved by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) for the&#xD;
      treatment of cancer, specifically melanoma. There is the potential that talimogene&#xD;
      laherparepvec could exert a systemic effect mitigating the potential of PDA to metastasize.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a phase 1 dose escalation study to evaluate the safety of talimogene laherparepvec in&#xD;
      PDA. To find out which doses are safe, all participants enrolled in this study will receive&#xD;
      up to 4 injections of T-Vec. At least two doses will be evaluated in this study, depending on&#xD;
      how many side effects are seen at each dose. Participants will not be able to pick the dose,&#xD;
      as this will be determined based on the study experience with participants enrolled&#xD;
      previously.&#xD;
