    <textblock>
      This is a observational validation study. The Stroke Clinical Decision Support Tool (&#xD;
      InstaDx) , an information technology application will be adapted and developed in accordance&#xD;
      to evidence based clinical practice guidelines ( Level IA). Neurology Residents will be using&#xD;
      the InstaDx CDST to improve their diagnostic accuracy and the findings will be validated&#xD;
      against the review of a stroke subject expert. The study hypothesis is that Clinical Decision&#xD;
      Support Tool used by neurology residents will have an agreement of &gt;0.77 when compared to&#xD;
      Stroke Expert (gold standard) in diagnosing type of ischemic stroke.&#xD;

      Overall Objective: To adapt, develop and validate the clinical decision support tool, an&#xD;
      information technology application to assist acute stroke diagnosis for use among neurology&#xD;
      graduate trainees compared to stroke expert (gold standard).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To validate the adapted clinical decision support tool, an information technology&#xD;
      application to assist acute ischemic stroke diagnosis for use among neurology residents&#xD;
      compared to stroke expert (Gold standard) in the adult population presenting at a tertiary&#xD;
      care hospital in Pakistan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in Emergency department and the Neurology ward at Aga Khan&#xD;
      University Hospital. The data collector will enroll the patients meeting the eligibility&#xD;
      criteria and providing informed consent. Neurology residents will use the Clinical Decision&#xD;
      Support Tool application to assist in acute stroke diagnosis. In the second part, the Stroke&#xD;
      Expert will independently assess all diagnosis. The purpose of this would be to validate the&#xD;
      Clinical Decision Support Tool application to assist in acute stroke diagnosis.&#xD;
