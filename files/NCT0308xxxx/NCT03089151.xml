  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An interdisciplinary team with extensive garden study experience conducted a pilot randomized&#xD;
      controlled clinical trial to see whether gardening reduced risk factors for diseases like&#xD;
      cancer and heart disease. The pilot trial will provide preliminary data on associations&#xD;
      between human microbiome, diet, physical activity, and social interactions and the outcomes&#xD;
      of weight status and key inflammatory biomarkers.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The pilot study will lead to development of a future, large randomized controlled clinical&#xD;
      trial, by fulfilling the following aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pilot Aim 1: Demonstrate feasibility of recruitment and ability to perform study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pilot Aim 2: Demonstrate the ability to measure accurately chronic disease risk factors such&#xD;
      as diet, physical activity, weight gain, microbiome characteristics and inflammatory&#xD;
      biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pilot Aim 3: Provide preliminary results on the efficacy of gardens as a preventive&#xD;
      intervention, and estimates for a detailed power analysis for the proposed subsequent larger&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3a: Demonstrate that compared to non-gardeners, gardeners have 1) greater intake of&#xD;
      fruits and vegetables; 2) better Healthy Eating Index (HEI); 3) lower Diet Inflammatory Index&#xD;
      (DII); 4) reduced sedentary time and increased moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA);&#xD;
      and reduced age-associated weight gain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3b: For gardeners and non-gardeners, sample garden soil, gut, skin, and oral microbiome&#xD;
      at six time points from April through September to characterize and compare bacterial load,&#xD;
      pathogenic taxa, taxonomic diversity, relative dominance, indicator taxa, and metabolomic&#xD;
      results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3c: Demonstrate that gardening reduces inflammatory biomarkers linked to heart disease&#xD;
      and cancer, including CRP, IL1b, IL4, IL6, IL10, and TNFa, and that the effect of gardening&#xD;
      is mediated by diet, weight gain, physical activity and characteristics of the microbiome.&#xD;

    <description>The investigators will recruit 30 prospective gardeners who have not been gardening for the past two years and who are listed on Denver Urban Gardens (DUG) wait lists. DUG randomly assigns people on each garden wait list to available plots, using a lottery. This creates a natural randomized experiment. Participants randomized to the garden intervention will receive a standardized garden resource package, which includes the following:&#xD;
A garden plot in a Denver Urban Garden&#xD;
Seeds and plant starts&#xD;
Introductory gardening workshop&#xD;
Social events including garden-specific events and garden mentoring.&#xD;
The non-gardening group will remain on the DUG wait lists and will not receive these resources.&#xD;
Duration of the intervention is 1 year.</description>
