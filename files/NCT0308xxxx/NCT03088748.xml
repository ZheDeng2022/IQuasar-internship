  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to acquire kinematic in vivo fluoroscopy data from subjects who&#xD;
      were implanted with the Smith &amp; Nephew Journey II posterior cruciate retaining (PCR) total&#xD;
      knee arthroplasty (TKA) or Journey II bi-cruciate retaining (BCR) TKA. CMR has previously&#xD;
      collected data for the Smith &amp; Nephew BCS TKA and compared these kinematics data to those of&#xD;
      normal knees.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective for this study is to analyze the in vivo kinematics for subjects implanted with&#xD;
      either a Journey II PCR or BCR TKA and compare those patterns to subjects having a normal&#xD;
      knee from our previous study and to those patterns from subjects having a Smith &amp; Nephew&#xD;
      Journey II BCS TKA.&#xD;

    <measure>Lateral Kinematics Translations While Ascending Ramp</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Anterior Posterior (AP) translations of lateral femoral condyles during activity of walking up a ramp. Data represents the motion of a specific part of the femur bone (in this case lateral femoral condyle) during the specified activity (in this case a ramp up). The kinematics (motion) is measured from the beginning of the activity to the end of the activity. Positive represents anterior motion of the femur, and negative represents posterior rollback of the femur. Data is only collected at a single time point and therefore refers to the motion of the femur bone during a specific activity at a single point in time.</description>

    <ipd_description>Researchers would like to retain this study data in our secure database so as to continue to add relevant, current data to our digital collection to help us work with manufacturers in the future to create better implants that last longer and will not require revision surgery. Participants will be asked if their study data may remain a part of the University of Tennessee's Center for Musculoskeletal Research data collection for use in future studies in the IC.

        <title>Lateral Kinematics Translations While Ascending Ramp</title>
        <description>Anterior Posterior (AP) translations of lateral femoral condyles during activity of walking up a ramp. Data represents the motion of a specific part of the femur bone (in this case lateral femoral condyle) during the specified activity (in this case a ramp up). The kinematics (motion) is measured from the beginning of the activity to the end of the activity. Positive represents anterior motion of the femur, and negative represents posterior rollback of the femur. Data is only collected at a single time point and therefore refers to the motion of the femur bone during a specific activity at a single point in time.</description>

          <title>Axial Rotation While Descending Ramp</title>
          <description>Femorotibial axial rotation during activity of walking down a ramp. Data represents the motion of a specific part of the femur bone (in this case femorotibial axial rotation) during the specified activity (in this case a ramp down). The kinematics (motion) is measured from the beginning of the activity to the end of the activity. Positive represents external rotation of the femur, and negative represents internal rotation of the femur. Data is only collected at a single time point and therefore refers to the motion of the femur bone during a specific activity at a single point in time.</description>

        <title>Lateral Kinematics Translations During Deep Knee Bend</title>
        <description>Anterior Posterior (AP) translations of lateral femoral condyles during a deep knee bend. Data represents the motion of a specific part of the femur bone (in this case lateral femoral condyle) during the specified activity (in this case a deep knee bend). The kinematics (motion) is measured from the beginning of the activity to the end of the activity. Positive represents anterior motion of the femur, and negative represents posterior rollback of the femur. Data is only collected at a single time point and therefore refers to the motion of the femur bone during a specific activity at a single point in time.</description>
