  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this phase I study is to test the safety of different dose levels of specially&#xD;
      prepared cells collected from the patient called &quot;modified T cells&quot;. The investigators want&#xD;
      to find a safe dose of modified T cells for patients with this type of cancer that has&#xD;
      progressed after standard therapy. The investigators also want to find out what effects these&#xD;
      modified T cells have on the patient and the cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients who were treated, had progression of disease and were removed from study,&#xD;
      duplicate enrollment is permitted if it is determined the patients could receive a benefit.&#xD;
      If the patients meet all eligibility criteria, they can be enrolled onto study a second time&#xD;
      as a new accrual, and receive treatment in a higher dose level cohort.&#xD;

    <description>Cohorts of 3-6 patients each will be treated with escalating doses of modified T cell. At least 3 patients will be treated at each dose level with an accrual of no more than 2 patients per month within each dose level. At least two weeks will elapse from the first patient's T cell infusions before the second patient is treated (on dose level 1) to allow for toxicity and safely assessment. All patients treated at the preceding dose level will be observed a minimum of 4 weeks before dose escalation occurs.</description>

    <description>Following enrollment, patients will undergo leukapheresis of peripheral blood for further T cell enrichment, activation and genetic modification using a retroviral vector encoding a CD19targeted CAR, the co-stimulatory ligand 4-1BBL and the EGFRt safety system (EGFRt/19-28z/4-1BBL). These T cells will be expanded and after the appropriate number of cells is generated, the modified T cells may be infused fresh or frozen for later use according to standard operation procedures. Modified T cell infusions will be administered 2-7 days following completion of the treating investigator's choice of conditioning chemotherapy. Serial sampling of blood and bone marrow will be performed following treatment to assess toxicity, therapeutic effects, and survival of the genetically modified T cells.</description>
