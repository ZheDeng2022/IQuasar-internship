    <textblock>
      This randomized phase III trial studies the best dose of apixaban and how well it works in&#xD;
      preventing secondary cancer related venous thrombosis in cancer patients who have completed&#xD;
      anticoagulation therapy. Apixaban may help in prevention by blocking some of the enzymes&#xD;
      needed for venous thrombosis.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Any episode of major bleeding including fatal bleeding or clinically relevant non-major&#xD;
      bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. The proportion of patients who experienced at least one such bleeding event within 6&#xD;
      months of beginning treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Venous thromboembolism (VTE) recurrence including deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary&#xD;
      embolism (PE), fatal PE, or arterial thromboembolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP I: Patients receive lower dose apixaban orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for 365 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP II: Patients receive higher dose apixaban PO BID for 365 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 12 months.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will be analyzed according to the drug they received. The analysis of major bleeding plus clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding events will primarily focus on those events which occurred during treatment or within 7 days of treatment discontinuation. Major bleeding events observed later will be described separately. The difference in the incidences of the combined endpoint at 6 months and at 12 months between treatment arms will be estimated along with a 95% confidence interval.</description>

    <description>Will estimate the difference in proportion of patients who experience at least one bleeding event (i.e. the primary endpoint) within 6 months of beginning treatment across the two study arms. As with the primary analysis, a 95% confidence interval will be calculated for the difference between arms.</description>
