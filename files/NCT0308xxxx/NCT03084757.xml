  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate the efficacy of targeted therapy based on tumor molecular profiling&#xD;
      versus conventional chemotherapy in patients with advanced cancer using each patient as its&#xD;
      own control. This study is a study involving patients with advanced cancer. All types of&#xD;
      solid tumors will be allowed in the study.&#xD;
