  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Leg ulcers are a significant cause of impaired functional ability and quality of life for&#xD;
      approximately 1-2 percent of the population in western countries. Although pain seems to be&#xD;
      one of the most devastating aspects of living with a chronic ulcer, research is limited and&#xD;
      there is a lack of knowledge about wound-related pain characteristics. Little is known about&#xD;
      prevalence, pain intensity, qualities, location, temporal fluctuations, to witch degree pain&#xD;
      impact on physical- and psychosocial functioning, as well as relieving and exacerbating&#xD;
      factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall purpose of this study is to investigate the prevalence and characteristics of&#xD;
      wound related pain in patients with chronic leg ulcers. More specific research questions are:&#xD;
      1) What is the prevalence and characteristics of wound related pain in patients suffering&#xD;
      from various types of persistent ulcers, 2) How do patients with different ulcer diagnoses&#xD;
      report the quality of the wound related pain, 3) Is there any differences in wound pain&#xD;
      characteristics among patients with different etiology leg ulcers, 4) How is the pain&#xD;
      temporal pattern in patients with chronic leg- and foot ulcers, 5) What is the reported&#xD;
      quality of life in patients with different ulcer diagnosis, and 6) Is there any association&#xD;
      among pain characteristics, sleep and quality of life in patients with chronic leg/foot&#xD;
      ulcers? The study has a non-experimental, explorative and descriptive approach. A&#xD;
      cross-sectional questionnaire design will be used to explore patient's experience of&#xD;
      wound-related pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be recruited at the outpatient clinic appointment and home-care nursing in&#xD;
      Norway. Participants will fill out self-report questionnaires. The battery of questionnaires&#xD;
      will obtain information about demographic data, pain characteristics, quality of life and&#xD;
      sleep. Pain characteristics, quality of life and sleep will be assessed by using different&#xD;
      questionnaires that has demonstrated high validity and reliability. In addition, the temporal&#xD;
      pattern of pain will be assessed by asking the participants to fill out a form stating&#xD;
      subjective level of pain (NRS) every hour during a typical day, and to mark times that they&#xD;
      rest and sleep. Relevant information about the diagnosis/classification of ulcer,&#xD;
      comorbidities, the ulcer management and pain management will be collected in a clinical&#xD;
      examination.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Design: The study has a non-experimental, explorative and descriptive approach. A&#xD;
      cross-sectional questionnaire design, that provides quantitative data, will be used to&#xD;
      explore patient's experience of wound-related pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment: Patients will be recruited from outpatient clinics and home-care nursing in&#xD;
      Norway. Written informed consent will be obtained from all eligible patients who agree to&#xD;
      participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be recruited at the outpatient clinic appointment. Those willing to&#xD;
      participate will complete the questionnaire independently and return the questionnaire by&#xD;
      mail in a pre-paid envelope. Furthermore, relevant information about the&#xD;
      diagnosis/classification of ulcer, comorbidities, the ulcer management and pain management&#xD;
      will be collected in a clinical examination, and by talking to the participants. The clinical&#xD;
      examination will take place in relation to already scheduled dressing-change, in order to&#xD;
      minimize the burden of participating in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on clinical experience, and expert opinion, the research group have reason to believe&#xD;
      that the ulcers can be classified in three main categories; ulcers with venous insufficiency&#xD;
      as main perpetuating factor, ulcers with arterial insufficiency as main perpetuating factor,&#xD;
      and ulcers with diabetes as the main perpetuating factor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will not look at the effect-size of an intervention, or test a hypothesis.&#xD;
      Therefore, the sample size is calculated based on the need to carry out the planed regression&#xD;
      analysis to look at predictors of quality of life for patient with different etiology leg&#xD;
      ulcers. In this study, quality of life will be a dependent variable, whereas pain, sleep,&#xD;
      age, gender, wound area and possibly social status will be independent variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size estimation is based on recommendations from statisticians and literature. The&#xD;
      &quot;rule of thumb&quot; recommended indicates a study size of N&gt; 104 + number of independent&#xD;
      variables (here 6). This gives N&gt; 110 in each group. The research group have chosen to set&#xD;
      the sample size of 120 respondents in each group to take into account any dropouts. Three&#xD;
      groups with 120 respondents result in a total sample size of 360 respondents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questionnaires Participants will fill out self-report questionnaires. The battery of&#xD;
      questionnaires will obtain information about demographic and clinical data, pain&#xD;
      characteristics, quality of life and sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic data: Information on age, gender, work situation, education, and living&#xD;
      arrangements will be collected. This information will be used to describe the patient sample&#xD;
      of the present study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical data: A research nurse will collect information about the patients' anamnesis and&#xD;
      ulcer. Relevant information will be collected on the diagnosis/classification of ulcer, the&#xD;
      ulcer management, and pain management. The measures included in this study are standardized&#xD;
      measures in the clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosis and classification of ulcer&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data will be collected in order for the research-group to classify the&#xD;
      different ulcers:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patients ulcer diagnosis (as stated by a medical doctor), the presumed causal factor&#xD;
           (such as trauma or pressure), comorbidities, localization of the ulcer (on a body map),&#xD;
           measure of wound size by multiplying the wounds width (millimeters at the widest) and&#xD;
           height (millimeters at the highest).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical signs of wound-infection (critical colonization): Unusual/bad smell, visible&#xD;
           pus, increased moisture, increased or changes in ulcer related pain, redness, swelling,&#xD;
           heat, reduced general condition, and fever.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Circulation of the leg will be assessed by palpation of ankle pulse. If no palpable&#xD;
           pulse is found, the pulse will be assessed with Doppler. If unable to detect the pulse&#xD;
           with Doppler, the Ankle-brachial pressure index will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reduced sensibility will be assessed with the monofilament and tuning-fork tests for&#xD;
           tactile and vibration sense.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The presence of visible varices will be registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A photograph of the ulcer and the lower leg and foot will be taken and used to classify&#xD;
           the ulcers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bothersome itch is assessed by asking the respondents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ulcer management: The research nurse will collect data on the ulcer management, such as the&#xD;
      frequency of wound dressing change, if wet or dry dressing/treatment is used, and whether or&#xD;
      not the patient has undergone ulcer debridement or revision surgery during the last week.&#xD;
      Furthermore, if the patient is recruited at an outpatient clinic, the patient is asked&#xD;
      whether this is the first consultation at the clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain management: Both medical and non-medical treatment for pain is registered. It will be&#xD;
      differentiated whether the pain management is aimed at ulcer pain or other types of pain that&#xD;
      the patients may suffer from.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Characteristics of wound-related pain Pain intensity: The 0 - 10 Numeric Rating Scale (NRS)&#xD;
      for pain is a one-dimensional measure of pain intensity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain qualities: The Short Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ) will be used to assess&#xD;
      different qualities of the subjective pain experience. The aim of this questionnaire is to&#xD;
      capture pain as a multidimensional phenomenon, recognizing the shortcomings of simple pain&#xD;
      intensity scales.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI): BPI provides information about the location, intensity,&#xD;
      treatment and impact of pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Temporal pattern of pain: There are no questionnaire available adapted for assessment of pain&#xD;
      pattern for use in self-report at one set time. The research group has designed and will test&#xD;
      a one-dimensional tool to assess the pattern of wound pain. The first part of the tool is&#xD;
      based on the last item of the Pain Quality Assessment Scale where the respondents select one&#xD;
      of tree statements reflecting intermittent pain, variable pain and stabile pain. The second&#xD;
      part of the tool includes a graph where the respondents indicate subjective level of pain (0&#xD;
      - 10 NRS) every hour during a typical day. Pertaining to level of pain, the participants also&#xD;
      mark specific times during the day spent in activity, resting, and sleeping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Localization of wound-related pain: The respondents will be asked about the location of&#xD;
      wound-related pain, and can choose among multiple alternative options, such as directly in&#xD;
      the wound or wound-bed, in the wound-edges, in the skin surrounding the wound, in the entire&#xD;
      foot, and in the entire leg. The respondents can also write in own words where the wound pain&#xD;
      is located.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life Will be assessed using The EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) which is a standardized&#xD;
      instrument developed by the EuroQol Research Foundation for use as a measure of health&#xD;
      outcome applicable to a wide range of health conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sleep The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) is a brief self-report instrument measuring the&#xD;
      patient's perception of sleep. The ISI targets the subjective symptoms and consequences of&#xD;
      insomnia as well as the degree of concerns or distress caused by those difficulties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses The data will be analyzed with appropriate parametric and nonparametric tests using&#xD;
      Statistical Package for the Social Sciences for Windows. The data will be analyzed using&#xD;
      means, standard deviations, correlation coefficients, analysis of variance (ANOVA) and&#xD;
      regression analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The photographs and clinical ulcer data will be evaluated by the research-group in order to&#xD;
      categorize the ulcers, based on predefined criteria for three etiology groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations This study is approved by the Regional Committees for Medical and&#xD;
      Health Research Ethics in Norway (region south-east). This should assure that the study&#xD;
      follows all necessary ethical considerations regarding cross-sectional quantitative research&#xD;
      design. Furthermore, the study is reported to the Data Inspectorate. Application for&#xD;
      permission to recruit participants has also been sent to the Head of the department in the&#xD;
      different clinics and community nursing services where patients will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in the study will be voluntary, and there will be no obligation to participate&#xD;
      or &quot;penalty&quot; or consequences for not participating. Patients will receive written and oral&#xD;
      information about study participation. An introductory letter that describes the purpose and&#xD;
      nature of the study and confidentiality of the data, as well as a written consent, form will&#xD;
      be handed out to potential participants. Patients willing to participate need to sign the&#xD;
      consent form before receiving the questionnaire. Confidentiality will be maintained through&#xD;
      coding of participants and removal of identifiers at an early stage in data analysis.&#xD;
      Completed questionnaires and codebooks will be stored separately and according to rules and&#xD;
      regulations set by the Ethics Committee and the involved hospital and community nursing&#xD;
      services. The completed questionnaires will be stored in locked and fire-safe safes. Digital&#xD;
      copies of data will be saved on research-servers at the University College of&#xD;
      Southeast-Norway (HSN).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The photographs taken of the patients' ulcers will not contain information that can identify&#xD;
      the patients. The study nurse will take the photo so that it only visualizes the wound and&#xD;
      lower leg/foot. The photo will be allocated the patients study-identification number, and&#xD;
      saved electronically on the research server at the HSN. No hard-copies of the photo will be&#xD;
      stored.&#xD;
