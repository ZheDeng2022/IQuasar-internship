      All hysterectomies were performed intrafascially using the clamp-cut-ligate method as&#xD;
      described by (Jones, 2003);&#xD;
&#xD;
      Careful examination under anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Catheterization by N. 18 Foley's catheter and its balloon Filled with 10-ml saline.A&#xD;
      transverse lower abdominal incision (Pfannenstiel incision) ranging from 8-12 cm through&#xD;
      which the abdomen is opened in layers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During subtotal hysterectomy procedure, the corpus is amputated just below the level of the&#xD;
      isthmus and then the endocervical canal is electrocoagulated using monopolar electrocautery.&#xD;
      The cervical stump is closed using vicryl 0 sutures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During total hysterectomy procedure, the urinary bladder is dissected off the lower uterine&#xD;
      segment of the uterus and cervix by blunt or sharp dissection. Blunt dissection is done using&#xD;
      a finger pushed gently against the cervix rather than against the bladder. Sharp dissection&#xD;
      using Metzenbaum scissors is performed in patients with previous cesarean sections, with&#xD;
      upward traction on the bladder peritoneum and the uterine fundus stretched tightly out of the&#xD;
      pelvis, the tips of the Metzenbaum scissors rest lightly on the fascia overlying the cervix&#xD;
      with small bites to develop a tissue plane, dissecting the bladder from the anterior cervix.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Revision of all pedicles to ensure hemostasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative antibiotics (1 gm of a 3rd generation cephalosporin + 0.5 gm metronidazole).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The abdomen is closed in layers; the wound is covered with a sterile dressing. All specimens&#xD;
      were sent for pathological examination in the pathology Unit.&#xD;

      Revision of all pedicles to ensure hemostasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative antibiotics (1 gm of a 3rd generation cephalosporin + 0.5 gm metronidazole).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The abdomen is closed in layers; the wound is covered with a sterile dressing. All specimens&#xD;
      were sent for pathological examination in the pathology Unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative care;&#xD;
&#xD;
      After ensuring complete recovery, the patient was transferred to the ward with close follow&#xD;
      up of the vital signs every 15 minutes till stable, then every 2 hours for 24 hours, then&#xD;
      every 8 hours till discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative antibiotics (1 gm of a 3rd generation cephalosporin + 0.5 gm metronidazole)&#xD;
      were given eight hourly for 24 hours then stopped (Hager, 2003).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative analgesics (Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) were given eight hourly for&#xD;
      24 hours then if needed&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intravenous fluids were given for the 1st 8 hours postoperative and then fluid diet was&#xD;
      allowed with early ambulation and deep breathing (Horowitz and Basil, 2003).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The urinary catheter was removed 24 hours postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon discharge, the patients were advised to resume work and sexual intercourse only after 4&#xD;
      weeks . An appointment was given to the patients to be seen 6 months after the operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre- and post-operative evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients were interviewed and examined preoperatively and 6 months postoperative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Urinary function was evaluated before surgery and 6 months afterward using;&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Subjective questionnaire to detect urinary Symptoms including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Diurnal frequency of micturition (voids &gt;6 times a day).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Nocturia (waking at night more than one time to void).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Urge urinary incontinence. (urine leakage related to a feeling of urgency).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Stress urinary incontinence. (urine leakage related to physical activity, coughing or&#xD;
           sneezing).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Dysuria (stinging/burning sensation).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Hesitancy (difficulty in initiating micturition).&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Reduction of the stream (compared to previous performance).&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Sensation of incomplete bladder emptying.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Haematuria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Physical examination:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stress test: With the bladder near full, the patient was asked to cough vigorously while&#xD;
      watching for leakage of urine .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluate levator ani muscle function by asking the patient to tighten her &quot;vaginal muscles&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Objective urodynamic studies: urodynamic evaluation was done for all participants in the&#xD;
      study. All urodynamic studies were performed using ANDROMEDA M00101-2 ELLIPSE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following tests were done:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Filling cystometry; the following parameters were evaluated and compared ;&#xD;
&#xD;
           First desire to void (The point at which the woman first experiences an awareness of the&#xD;
           need to empty her bladder).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Maximum cystometric capacity (The point at which the woman can delay micturition no&#xD;
           longer).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Maximum detrusor pressure reached during filling phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Uroflowmetry:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Where the maximum flow rate and the residual volume were identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The patient presented with a symptomatically full bladder. She voided spontaneously in a&#xD;
           uroflow chair. Maximum flow rate and postvoid residual urine volume were obtained via a&#xD;
           transurethral catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The microtransducer catheters were connected to the appropriate cables and to the tubing&#xD;
           from the water pump.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. With the patient in the supine position on a urodynamic chair, the abdominal catheter&#xD;
           was placed into the vagina . A dual microtransducer 6-French catheter with a filling&#xD;
           port was then placed into the bladder . The patient was moved to a sitting position.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. After the catheters were appropriately placed, the subtraction was checked by asking the&#xD;
           patient to cough. Cough-induced pressure spikes should be seen on the Pves and Pabd&#xD;
           channels, but not on the true detrusor pressure channel.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The urinary bladder was filled with normal saline at room temperature with a filling&#xD;
           rate 50-100 ml/min. First desire to void and strong desire to void were recorded.&#xD;
           Throughout the filling portion of the examination, the patient was asked to perform&#xD;
           provocative activities, such as coughing and straining. The external urethral meatus was&#xD;
           constantly observed for any involuntary urine loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sexual function: The patients were interviewed before surgery and 6 months afterward and&#xD;
      sexual function was evaluated using a subjective questionnaire measuring the following sexual&#xD;
      variables :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Libido (desire): It is described as perceiving sexual desire once a week or more, which&#xD;
           is a subjective feeling state.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Frequency of intercourse (once a week or more).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Dyspareunia (painful coitus).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Frequency of orgasm: the most intense pleasure followed by sudden release of the tension&#xD;
           that has built up during excitement. It is described as (always or often).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Sense of vaginal dryness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Satisfaction with sexual life (satisfied-not satisfied).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients were allowed to resume sexual intercourse 4 weeks after the operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection included:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Postoperative recording of operation time, intra-operative blood transfusion (if&#xD;
           needed), length of hospital stay, and pathology of the removed uterus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Postoperative complications including pyrexia, vault haematoma, wound haematoma, wound&#xD;
           infection, vaginal bleeding, need for blood transfusion, postoperative pain, cervical&#xD;
           stump prolapse, and vaginal vault prolapse.&#xD;
