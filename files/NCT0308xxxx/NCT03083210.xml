  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinical data from uncontrolled retrospective or prospective studies have initially&#xD;
      demonstrated antiproliferative effects of lanreotide in limited number of patients lanreotide&#xD;
      Autogel® has recently been approved in more than 40 countries for the treatment of GEP-NET&#xD;
      patients, this is based on the results of CLARINET study, the largest prospective trial to&#xD;
      evaluate the antiproliferative effects of lanreotide Autogel® in subjects with nonfunctional&#xD;
      GEP-NETs. The study enrolled 204 subjects (101 subjects were randomized to lanreotide&#xD;
      Autogel® group and 103 subjects were randomized to placebo group, came from 14 countries)&#xD;
      with well or moderately differentiated non-functioning GEP-NETs, including pancreatic and&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tumors, and defined as having less than 10% of proliferation marker Ki67.&#xD;
      The study had shown that treatment with lanreotide Autogel® significantly prolonged&#xD;
      progression-free survival in subjects with GEP-NETs compared to treatment with placebo in the&#xD;
      primary analysis (median progression-free survival, not reached vs. 18.0 months, P&lt; 0.001 by&#xD;
      the stratified log-rank test; hazard ratio for progression or death with lanreotide vs.&#xD;
      placebo, 0.47; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.30 to 0.73) [5].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The indication of GEP-NETs granted for lanreotide Autogel® in the USA is for the treatment of&#xD;
      patients with unresectable, well or moderately differentiated, locally advanced or metastatic&#xD;
      gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) to improve progression-free survival;&#xD;
      and in the European Union (EU) is for treatment of grade 1 and a subset of grade 2 (Ki67&#xD;
      index up to 10%) gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors of midgut, pancreatic or&#xD;
      unknown origin where hindgut sites of origin have been excluded, in adult patients with&#xD;
      unresectable locally advanced or metastatic disease. The addition of an indication for the&#xD;
      treatment of patients with GEP-NETs has been approved by more than 15 other authorities&#xD;
      including in Canada, Australia and some Asian countries, etc.&#xD;
