    <intervention_model_description>This is a single arm phase 2 study to evaluate a post-transplant proteasome inhibitor, ixazomib, as prophylaxis against recurrent or late acute and chronic GVHD. Ixazomib will be initiated within days 100 to 150 post-transplant in patient's ≥ 18 years-old with either myeloid or lymphoid hematologic malignancy treated with a RI or NMA HSCT and will have received calcineurin inhibitor based drug (tacrolimus or cyclosporin) and methotrexate as part of their initial GVHD prophylaxis.</intervention_model_description>
