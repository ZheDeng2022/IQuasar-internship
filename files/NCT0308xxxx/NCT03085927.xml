  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Music therapy, a frequently used arts-based therapy, has become standard palliative care in&#xD;
      many pediatric and adult hospitals; however, few studies have examined the mechanisms by&#xD;
      which music therapy interventions work. This study investigates behavioral, social, and&#xD;
      psychological factors that may explain how an Active Music Engagement (AME) intervention&#xD;
      (i.e., an interactive, music-based play intervention) works to manage emotional distress and&#xD;
      improve positive health outcomes in parents and young children with cancer during treatment.&#xD;
      Findings will provide scientific and clinically relevant practice knowledge to guide delivery&#xD;
      of music therapy as a complementary therapy.&#xD;

      Music therapy, a frequently used arts-based therapy, has become standard palliative care in&#xD;
      many pediatric and adult hospitals; however, few studies have examined mechanisms by which&#xD;
      music therapy interventions work.Based on the Contextual Support Model of Music Therapy, the&#xD;
      investigators developed and tested the Active Music Engagement (AME) intervention,&#xD;
      establishing it as a feasible and acceptable intervention that reduces emotional distress in&#xD;
      young children (ages 3-8) hospitalized for cancer treatment.Emotional distress in young&#xD;
      children with cancer during acute treatment and their parents is a prevalent,persistent&#xD;
      problem associated with physical symptom distress and diminished quality of life and family&#xD;
      function. The music therapist-led AME uses music-based play and parent education/support&#xD;
      (music play resource kit; tip sheets), is easy to implement, and teaches parents/children how&#xD;
      to therapeutically use a familiar activity to manage distress. The purpose of this two group&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial is to identify behavioral, sociological, and psychological&#xD;
      variables contributing to positive outcomes observed in previous AME studies (i.e.,&#xD;
      mediators) and identify for whom the intervention works (i.e., moderators). The investigators&#xD;
      will examine proximal mediators of child engagement and parent-child interaction and distal&#xD;
      mediators of perceived family normalcy, parent confidence (self-efficacy) about their ability&#xD;
      to support their child during treatment, and independent parent/child use of music and play&#xD;
      activities to manage distress during hospitalization. The investigators hypothesize these&#xD;
      factors mediate change in outcomes of child emotional distress, physical symptom distress,&#xD;
      and quality of life; parent emotional/traumatic distress and quality of life; and family&#xD;
      function. Specific aims are to examine: 1) effects of proximal and distal mediators of AME on&#xD;
      young child/parent outcomes; 2) moderators of AME on young child/parent distress; 3) explore&#xD;
      child physical symptom distress (pain, fatigue, nausea) in mediation and moderation models.&#xD;
      Child/parent dyads (n=184) will be stratified by age and randomized in blocks of 6 to AME or&#xD;
      audio-storybooks; each group will receive three 45-minute sessions with a credentialed music&#xD;
      therapist for 3 consecutive days with data collection at baseline, post-intervention, and 30&#xD;
      days later. Mediation effects will be estimated using ANCOVA, fitting appropriate mediation&#xD;
      models using MPlus and then testing indirect effects using the percentile bootstrap approach&#xD;
      to estimate indirect effect. Moderation effects will be tested by including appropriate&#xD;
      interaction terms of the potential moderator with the intervention indicator in our models.&#xD;

    <description>Family Normalcy is assessed through The Family Management Measure (FaMM) - Family Life Difficulty Subscale includes 14-items rated on a 5-point Likert-type scale. Subscale items address parents' perceptions of the extent to which having a child with a chronic condition makes family life difficult. Higher values indicate more difficulty managing the condition. Score range 14 - 70.</description>

During the first visit, parent and child will receive information on common responses of young children to cancer treatment and how parents can use music play activities to support their child during treatment. The music therapist will lead parent and child in a variety of music play activities. Parent and child will receive a music kit that includes items such as hand-held rhythm instruments, puppets, and a music CD. During the second and third visit the music therapist will lead parent and child child through the music play activities, answer questions, and make suggestions for using these activities in the hospital and at home.</description>
