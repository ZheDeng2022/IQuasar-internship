    <textblock>
      It is necessary and important to design tools to evaluate a central aspect of medical&#xD;
      residents formation. The research group has been working with resident well-being since a few&#xD;
      years in order to improve the global quality of the education and working environment. The&#xD;
      investigators present a plan to develop and validate a tool to assess residents well-being. A&#xD;
      tool designed with this characteristics would be of much importance to monitored as a&#xD;
      security event, managed and actively promoted well being in residents.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The residency promotes learning, improves the development of skills, competencies, practices&#xD;
      and attitudes characteristic of each different medical specialty. Just as the health of the&#xD;
      children reflects the health and future of a population, the university and the residency are&#xD;
      likely to reflect the quality of the health system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collapsed and overloaded health systems rely on residents as a low-cost human resource. The&#xD;
      residency program should be characterized by a supervised learning system to promote&#xD;
      progressive independence in decision making and clinical reasoning. This learning experience&#xD;
      can be affected by many factors like stress, sleep deprivation, poor learning environments,&#xD;
      relocation issues, vertical structure, excess of administrative tasks and work overload among&#xD;
      others. This characteristics of the learning/working environment have an individual direct&#xD;
      impact on safety, processing, learning and decision-making capacity and a group effect on&#xD;
      safety and quality of patient's care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Residents are a population of high risk for depression, burnout and social isolation. The&#xD;
      well-being of residents is a key aspect of their training that can be monitored as a security&#xD;
      event, managed and actively promoted. While several strategies are used to measure the degree&#xD;
      of work overload and its impact on training residents, none seems to be holistic and&#xD;
      appropriate to understand the dimensions of this complex phenomenon. The aim is to generate&#xD;
      and validate a tool to measure the well-being of residents considering their multidimensional&#xD;
      features.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Question: Is it possible to built a valid instrument to measure well-being in&#xD;
      residents of medical residency programs?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instrument description: It is planned to develop a paper multidimensional, self-administered,&#xD;
      questionnaire, relative brief, which considers the most important domains of well-being. The&#xD;
      main features of the instrument are shown in figure 2 (domains, format, administration,&#xD;
      score).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The whole process of generation and validation of the instrument of well-being measurement in&#xD;
      residents will be developed according to study protocol. All study participant will give&#xD;
      freely informed consent to participate. The protocol and its informed consent will be&#xD;
      evaluated and approved by an independent research ethics committee before starting the study.&#xD;
      The protocol will be registered in argentinian public database of research protocols and in&#xD;
      clinicaltrials.gov.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Development and validation&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Well-being instrument development&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.1. Conceptual framework development: The aim of the first meeting is to construct a&#xD;
           simpler conceptual framework about the medical resident well-being considering the&#xD;
           literature review, thoughts, expertise and experience of each participant. In group of&#xD;
           experts in education, residents and medical specialists will develop a group conceptual&#xD;
           framework using the Nominal Group Technique (NGT). This technique is a solving method&#xD;
           designed to provide each member of a group with an equal voice in the resolution of a&#xD;
           particular problem. A complete description of the original technique may be found in Van&#xD;
           de Ven AH, Delbecq AL. The nominal group as a research instrument for exploratory health&#xD;
           studies. Am J Public Health. 1972; 62: 337-342 7.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2. Domain selection The domains will be selected according to consensus in a group of&#xD;
           experts in education, residents and medical specialists considering the conceptual&#xD;
           framework defined for the problem in previous meeting. Potential domains to include are&#xD;
           physical, mental, social, role/functional, fatigue/sleep, burnout, work environment,&#xD;
           future potentiality, mistreat/abuse, learning experience/environment, self care, and&#xD;
           resilience.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Previous instruments will be considered, conceptual framework, experience and opinion of&#xD;
           the participating experts, and bibliography on the well-being of residents to decide the&#xD;
           main domains to be represented in the instrument. NGT will be used to make this grupal&#xD;
           decision.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.3. Item selection to access each domain Each domain will consist of between 5 and 10&#xD;
           items. Likert or pseudo-Likert scales will be used with 5 standard options with a&#xD;
           neutral central value. All the items will be affirmations or statements obtained from&#xD;
           previous instruments that measure similar constructs, previous literature, experience of&#xD;
           the consensus group integrated by residents, specialists in education, medical&#xD;
           specialists.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Initially, all the items that the group considers pertinent per domain will be included.&#xD;
           For the generation of the list of items per domain, the NGT will be used again. For the&#xD;
           design of the items, previous instruments, conceptual framework, experience and opinion&#xD;
           of the participating experts, and bibliography on the well-being of residents should be&#xD;
           considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The list of items per domain, will be reduced to contain a minimum of 5 items and a&#xD;
           maximum of 10 items according to group discussion and consensus. The NGT will be used&#xD;
           again to define a group order according to importance Each participant of the consensus&#xD;
           group will order the items of each domain according to order of importance. The items&#xD;
           will be reduced according to the redundancy, difficult for the translation to other&#xD;
           languages, awkward of phrases, excessively idiomatic expressions, difficulty in&#xD;
           understanding or less relative importance with respect to the rest of the items.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The selected items will be refined. They will be phrased in plain language to avoid&#xD;
           ambiguities. With a single concept by affirmation, in short sentences. A 7th grade or&#xD;
           complete primary education (according to the argentinian education system) level will be&#xD;
           used. The use of slang confusing words will be avoided. The time frame for each item to&#xD;
           increase measurement precision and avoid ambiguity will be discussed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The items will be sorted in order to keep more general and less personal items at the&#xD;
           beginning, and more private items at the end. The items referred to the same time frame&#xD;
           or similar concepts will be order in proximity. The order of the items will not respect&#xD;
           the domains, but will be designed to increase responsiveness, comprehension and&#xD;
           precision. The options will always be evenly arranged to avoid errors in filling.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.4. Scale and scoring structure design For the scaling of each item on the Likert or&#xD;
           pseudo-Likert scale, a score from 0 for the worst lack of well-being, and 4 for the best&#xD;
           well-being option will be used. In all cases, the highest score will be assigned to the&#xD;
           response that represents the greater well-being situation and the lower score to the&#xD;
           lower well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The results of each questionnaire will be presented as one score per domain and a global&#xD;
           score. Each domain will have a maximum score of 100 and a minimum of 0, as well as the&#xD;
           global score. Each item will be assigned a weighted score according to group consensus&#xD;
           on the importance of the items in each domain. The score of each domain will be obtained&#xD;
           by adding the weighted scores of each item within the domain. Each domain will be&#xD;
           assigned a weighted score according to the global importance of the domain in the whole&#xD;
           construct decided by group consensus. This weights assigned to each domain will be used&#xD;
           to sum a global score for the whole questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Once the validation period of the instrument has been finished, the scale will be&#xD;
           applied to a larger population of residents using networks like the Sociedad Argentina&#xD;
           de Medicina (Argentinian Medicine Society). With these results, the averages and&#xD;
           standard deviations will be obtained. This tables will be used to calculate a z-score&#xD;
           (standard deviation units) according to sex and age for each domain and the global&#xD;
           score.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.5. Preliminary version and pretest A preliminary version that will be pretested with a&#xD;
           group of residents will be presented, medical specialists and specialists in medical&#xD;
           education. Clear instructions should be added in the header on how to complete the&#xD;
           questionnaire and how to solve it in case of mistakes during the answers. A final&#xD;
           thank-you message will be added.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Validation&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1. Content validity and face validity: To evaluate face validity and content validity the&#xD;
      final version of the questionnaire produced during the development phases will be used. Face&#xD;
      validity will be evaluated asking to different participants whether the questionnaire seems&#xD;
      to be valid to represent the construct well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Content validity will be evaluated with instrument inspection and discussion by a group of&#xD;
      experts and residents as describe in the last section of the development phase. The group&#xD;
      discussion will be focused on whether the instrument incorporates the appropriate components&#xD;
      and facets for the measurement of the construct that is intended to represent. Each&#xD;
      participant will answer if all the items included in the questionnaire are essential to&#xD;
      represent the construct resident well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2. Criterion validity Criterion validity will be evaluated assessing concurrent validity&#xD;
      and predictive validity using the same sample of residents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no appropriate gold standard to evaluate the concurrent validity as I have not found&#xD;
      any other instrument designed and validated to represent the construct well-being of&#xD;
      residents with the chosen perspective. Two imperfect approximations will be used as gold&#xD;
      standard: the correlation of the global score with the SF36 [20] as a tool to access global&#xD;
      quality of life and the WRQoL scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample of residents will complete the three questionnaires (SF36, WRQoL and the well-being&#xD;
      in residents questionnaire). Pearson's correlation coefficient will be used to evaluate the&#xD;
      association of the global scale with SF36 and WRQoL. Even though this two scales are not gold&#xD;
      standards for this construct the investigators expect them to be highly correlated to the&#xD;
      global scale of the new instrument.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate predictive validity the same sample of residents will be used to access if the&#xD;
      new questionnaire is able to predict the occurrence of future events: medical error, level of&#xD;
      stress and depression, alcoholism, drug abuse, and residence abandon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3. Construct validity The evaluation of construct validity implies the accumulation of&#xD;
      evidence that the questionnaire actually measures the construct. To evaluate the construct&#xD;
      validity of the residents well-being questionnaire the convergent and discriminant validity&#xD;
      will be evaluated (Multitrait-Multimethod approach), test hypothesis of association between&#xD;
      the questionnaire scale and different situations and evaluating the behaviour of known&#xD;
      groups. With all this evaluations, the investigators are planning to gather information about&#xD;
      the performance of the questionnaire scale to the conceptual model of hypothesized&#xD;
      relationships.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Convergent and discriminant validity will be tested by measuring in a sample of residents&#xD;
      simultaneously related and not related scales and the well-being questionnaire. To access&#xD;
      convergent validity, physical activity, depression, anxiety will be used. To access&#xD;
      discriminant validity use socio-economical status will be used, SF36 and subscales and the&#xD;
      domains of BMI. The Multitrait-Multimethod Approach will be used to build a matrix of&#xD;
      correlations between the different scales accessed and each domain and global scale of the&#xD;
      well-being questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally it is expected to see more well-being related to some specific rotations like&#xD;
      clinical research, and elective rotations compare to night shift or during the excess of&#xD;
      workload of vacation period. The measurements of this instruments will be compared in the&#xD;
      same residents during this specific rotations.&#xD;
