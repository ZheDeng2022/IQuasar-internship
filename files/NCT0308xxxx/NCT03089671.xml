    <textblock>
      Background: The risk of ureteric injury at the time of pelvic reconstructive surgery can be&#xD;
      as high as 3% and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has stated that&#xD;
      intraoperative cystoscopy should be done after all such procedures. Intravenous indigo&#xD;
      carmine was routinely given during surgery to colour the urine bright blue and allow for&#xD;
      assessment of ureteric integrity. In 2014, indigo carmine was no longer available worldwide&#xD;
      and since then, surgeons have been searching for suitable alternatives. Vitamin B is a water&#xD;
      soluble vitamin that colours the urine bright yellow and can be given immediately before&#xD;
      surgery to help with ureteric visualization. Alternatively, 5% dextrose in water (D5W) can be&#xD;
      used as the instillation fluid during cystoscopy to allow for urine jet visualization due to&#xD;
      the difference in fluid viscosity. Both agents have been shown to be better than instillation&#xD;
      with normal saline and are affordable and accessible in Canada.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To identify which agent is superior for intraoperative ureteric visualization at&#xD;
      the time of cystoscopy by determining the difference in detection rate of both ureteric jets&#xD;
      using either preoperative oral vitamin B or intraoperative cystoscopic distension with D5W.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This study will be a three-site (Mount Sinai Hospital, Sunnybrook Health Sciences&#xD;
      Centre, Women's College Hospital), double-blinded, randomized control trial whereby female&#xD;
      patients undergoing pelvic reconstructive surgery will be randomized to receive either&#xD;
      preoperative vitamin B or intraoperative D5W cystoscopic instillation fluid. Parameters&#xD;
      measured during surgery will include whether both ureteric jets were seen, time to&#xD;
      visualization of both ureters, colour of jets, and surgeon satisfaction. Patients will also&#xD;
      be seen at one week after surgery to assess for urinary tract infection. Sample size&#xD;
      calculation based on previous studies demonstrated a need for 119 patients per study arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated Clinical Significance: The findings of this study will be relevant to all&#xD;
      surgeons performing intraoperative cystoscopy where ureteric visualization is required. The&#xD;
      investigators believe the outcome of this study will help make cystoscopy shorter and more&#xD;
      efficient for surgeons who often feel the pressure of time constraints within the operating&#xD;
      room setting. In turn, decreasing the time of cystoscopy may reduce operating times which&#xD;
      will benefit both the patient and hospital.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study Design: This study will be a double blinded, randomized control trial (RCT) to compare&#xD;
      detection rates of one and both ureteric jets at the time of intraoperative cystoscopy using&#xD;
      either vitamin B or D5W. This will be a multicentre study with patients being recruited from&#xD;
      Mount Sinai Hospital, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, and Women's College Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and Consent: Female patients undergoing pelvic reconstructive surgery where&#xD;
      cystoscopic ureteric visualization is required will be recruited from Mount Sinai&#xD;
      Hospital/Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre/Women's College Hospital at their surgical consult&#xD;
      in the clinic/ambulatory setting. At that time, one of the study investigators (not the&#xD;
      operating physician for that particular patient) will describe the study to the patient and&#xD;
      give her the study consent form if she is interested in participating. For any patients&#xD;
      recruited or considering the study, they will be asked to stop all vitamin supplements one&#xD;
      week before surgery. If the patient cannot decide on the day of the surgical consult, they&#xD;
      can go home with an unsigned consent form to review the study and on the day of surgery they&#xD;
      will once again be asked if they would like to participate in the study by a study&#xD;
      investigator (not involved with the patient's surgery). Once the patient has read and&#xD;
      voluntarily signed the consent form, the same study investigator will open a sequentially&#xD;
      numbered opaque sealed envelope that will provide a study identification number for the&#xD;
      patient and randomize the patient to either receiving a preoperative dose of vitamin B or&#xD;
      intraoperative cystoscopic distension with D5W. The patient and operating surgeons will not&#xD;
      be made aware of the group the patient was allocated to.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Calculation: There is only one study in the literature that has commented on&#xD;
      ureteric visualization after vitamin B2 ingestion. In this study, they report a 72% detection&#xD;
      rate. If we consider a 15% difference in detection rate to be clinically significant, then&#xD;
      with a power of 0.8 and an alpha of 0.05, the minimum number of patients required per group&#xD;
      would be 113. We anticipate a 5% drop out rate after consent due to intraoperative issues.&#xD;
      Therefore, we will recruit 119 patients per study arm to be included in the final analyses&#xD;
      (n=238).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: Upon recruitment to the study, the study investigator that did the consent will then&#xD;
      complete the Initial Information Form where the following information will be collected from&#xD;
      the patient (this information is also already available in the clinical record):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Parity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BMI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Smoking status&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diabetic status&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Menopausal status&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Immunocompromised status&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pelvic Organ Prolapse-Quantification (POP-Q) stage&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Preoperative use of vaginal estrogen&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  History of recurrent UTI&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient packages will be created and assigned a patient number. For those randomized to the&#xD;
      vitamin B group, the package will consist of a pill of vitamin B2 (containing 100mg of&#xD;
      riboflavin) that is inside an opaque gelatin capsule that is matched to a litre bag of normal&#xD;
      saline that is wrapped in an opaque covering. For those randomized to the D5W group, the&#xD;
      package will consist of a pill of cellulose that is inside an opaque gelatin capsule that is&#xD;
      matched to a litre bag of D5W that is wrapped in an opaque covering. These packages will be&#xD;
      couple with the patient according to her randomization group in the preoperative area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the preoperative area, all patients will be given the pill in their package by mouth 60 to&#xD;
      120 minutes before the start of surgery. The covered bag will then accompany the patient to&#xD;
      the operating room and will be set up as the instillation fluid for cystoscopy. This way, the&#xD;
      patient and operating team will be blinded to what agent was used for ureteric visualization.&#xD;
      Cystoscopy will be done using a standard diagnostic 70 degree cystoscope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the preoperative area and in the operating room, the following data will be collected by a&#xD;
      study investigator that is not part of the operating team:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time pill was given&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time cystoscopy was started&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time surgeon started to look for ureteric jets&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time first ureter was visualized&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time second ureter was visualized&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Colour of jet (clear, pale yellow, or bright yellow)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If cystoscopy is repeated to look at ureters, above measures are captured again&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If fluorescein (0.25mL by iv injection) is used as a rescue agent, reason why, time it&#xD;
           was given, and time jets were seen are recorded (in order to allow for an adequate time&#xD;
           to determine whether the study agent has worked, fluorescein cannot be used any earlier&#xD;
           than 10 minutes from the start of cystoscopy)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surgeon satisfaction of ureteric visualization during that specific case is rated on a&#xD;
           Likert scale from 1 to 5&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary surgeon's guess at the agent that was used to visualize ureters&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between post-operative days 3 and 10, the patient will present to clinic and information on&#xD;
      length and type of catheter use, as well as antibiotic use after surgery will be recorded.&#xD;
      Patients will also give a catheter urine specimen to be sent for culture and sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA ANALYSIS Baseline characteristics and follow-up measures will be summarized using&#xD;
      descriptive statistics (mean, SD, median, and range for continuous variables, count and&#xD;
      percent for categorical variables). Continuous variables will be summarized using means and&#xD;
      standard deviations, and will be compared between groups using Student's t-tests. Categorical&#xD;
      variables will be summarized using counts and percents, and compared between groups using&#xD;
      Chi-squared tests. A P-value ≤0.05 will be considered significant for all statistical&#xD;
      analyses performed.&#xD;
