  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II clinical trial studies how well panitumumab with or without trametinib works in&#xD;
      treating patients with stage IV colorectal cancer. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies,&#xD;
      such as panitumumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere&#xD;
      with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Trametinib may stop the growth of tumor&#xD;
      cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving panitumumab with or&#xD;
      without trametinib may work better in treating patients with stage IV colorectal cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the anti-tumor efficacy of panitumumab monotherapy in patients who were&#xD;
      initially KRAS/NRAS/BRAF wild-type at baseline who have progressed on prior anti-EGFR therapy&#xD;
      and subsequently have detectable EGFR ectodomain mutation post-progression in circulating&#xD;
      free tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the anti-tumor efficacy of panitumumab and trametinib combination therapy in&#xD;
      patients who were initially KRAS/NRAS/BRAF wild-type at baseline who have progressed on prior&#xD;
      anti-EGFR therapy and subsequently have detectable levels of KRAS, NRAS, and/or BRAF mutation&#xD;
      post-progression in circulating free tumor DNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the anti-tumor efficacy of panitumumab monotherapy in patients who were&#xD;
      initially KRAS/NRAS/BRAF wild-type at baseline who have progressed on prior anti-EGFR therapy&#xD;
      and subsequently do not have detectable KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, or EGFR ectodomain mutation&#xD;
      post-progression in circulating free tumor DNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the toxicities of panitumumab and trametinib combination therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the anti-tumor efficacy of panitumumab and trametinib combination therapy in&#xD;
      patients who were initially KRAS/NRAS/BRAF wild-type at baseline who progressed on prior&#xD;
      anti-EGFR therapy, developed detectable EGFR ectodomain mutations, and progress through&#xD;
      retreatment with panitumumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the anti-tumor efficacy of panitumumab and trametinib combination therapy in&#xD;
      patients who were initially KRAS/NRAS/BRAF wild-type at baseline who progressed on prior&#xD;
      anti-EGFR therapy, did not develop detectable mutations in KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, or EGFR&#xD;
      ectodomain, and progress through retreatment with panitumumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate clinical outcomes with panitumumab monotherapy in patients who were initially&#xD;
      KRAS/NRAS/BRAF wild-type at baseline who have progressed on prior anti-EGFR therapy and&#xD;
      subsequently have detectable EGFR ectodomain mutation post-progression in circulating free&#xD;
      tumor DNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To evaluate clinical outcomes with panitumumab and trametinib combination therapy in&#xD;
      patients who were initially KRAS/NRAS/BRAF wild-type at baseline who have progressed on prior&#xD;
      anti-EGFR therapy and subsequently have detectable levels of KRAS, NRAS, and/or BRAF mutation&#xD;
      post-progression in circulating free tumor DNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To evaluate clinical outcomes with panitumumab monotherapy in patients who were initially&#xD;
      KRAS/NRAS/BRAF wild-type at baseline who have progressed on prior anti-EGFR therapy and&#xD;
      subsequently do not have detectable KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, or EGFR ectodomain mutation&#xD;
      post-progression in circulating free tumor DNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To study the biological basis of development of primary and secondary resistance to&#xD;
      anti-EGFR antibodies and MEK inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT 1: Patients with EGFR ectodomain mutation receive panitumumab intravenously (IV) over&#xD;
      30-90 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat every 14 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients with disease progression may crossover to Cohort 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT 2: Patients with KRAS, NRAS, or BRAF mutation receive trametinib orally (PO) once&#xD;
      daily (QD) on days 1-14 and panitumumab as in Cohort 1. Cycles repeat every 14 days in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT 3: Patients without EGFR ectodomain, KRAS, NRAS, or BRAF mutation receive panitumumab&#xD;
      as in Cohort 1. Cycles repeat every 14 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients with disease progression may crossover to Cohort 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks and then every 3&#xD;
      months for 24 months.&#xD;
