      OBJECTIVES:To assess the effect of the intervention with Mediterranean Diet (MD) supplemented&#xD;
      with extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) or tree nuts (TN) during 2 years (compared to a control&#xD;
      group without intervention) on the risk of recurrence of unipolar depressive disorder in&#xD;
      patients with partial or total remission for unipolar depressive disorder (1). Differences&#xD;
      between groups in changes in residual symptoms (2), quality of life (QL) (3), biochemical&#xD;
      parameters (4) and in the risk of medical/psychiatric co-morbidities (5) will be also&#xD;
      analyzed. Finally, gut microbiota and its changes will be collected and compared between&#xD;
      groups (6). METHODS: Multicenter clinical trial with 3 arms of intervention (MD+EVOO;&#xD;
      MD+TN;control) during 2 years. Adults with previous episodes of unipolar depressive disorder&#xD;
      in partial or total remission stage (determined through Montgomery-Asberg questionnaire and&#xD;
      MINI interview) will be included. Participants with current depression, psychiatric co-morbid&#xD;
      disorders or with problems to follow dietary recommendations will be excluded. A recurrence&#xD;
      ratio of 35% in the MD groups and of 50% in the control group will be considered (Hazard&#xD;
      Ratio: 0.7). We estimate a sample size of 720 participants (750 to count for losses) (90%&#xD;
      power and 5% alpha error). Intervention will be performed through postal mail (recipes and&#xD;
      information), email, phone y new technologies (Web page/mobile app) with periodic contacts&#xD;
      with psychiatrics and dieticians and postal mail for free EVOO and nuts supply. Information&#xD;
      from participants will be gathered with validated questionnaires of diet, physical activity,&#xD;
      QL, or symptoms using postal mail, email, Web page or the phone. The analyses will be&#xD;
      performed by intention to treat.&#xD;

      DESIGN This trial is a multicenter, parallel clinical trial with 3 intervention arms, two of&#xD;
      them with Mediterranean Diet (MD) supplemented extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) or tree nuts&#xD;
      (TN) and the last one is the control group without any kind of nutritional intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE Seven groups across Spain have agreed to participate in the trial and will recruit&#xD;
      participants. With a 5% alpha error, 90% power and considering an incidence of recurrence of&#xD;
      depression after 2 years of intervention of 35% in the MD groups and of 50% in the control&#xD;
      group, we will need 240 participants in each group. Considering also possible losses, finally&#xD;
      we have estimated a sample size of 750 participants, 108 participants in each of the&#xD;
      recruitment centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion criteria were defined after an exhaustive review of the scientific literature&#xD;
      and under consensus among all the psychiatric and clinical psychologists included in the&#xD;
      study. We will include 1 participant with a unique episode of depression for each three&#xD;
      participants with 2 or more episodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SELECTION OF PARTICIPANTS Clinical psychologists and psychiatrists will carry out the&#xD;
      pre-selection of the participants after a detailed review of their clinical records. When a&#xD;
      participant is pre-selected, the psychiatrists will perform a semi-structured interview (MINI&#xD;
      interview) according to DSM-V criteria and a Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale to&#xD;
      discard depression and other mental disorders diagnoses and to assess depression remission&#xD;
      degree. This information will be completed with some questions included in the eligibility&#xD;
      questionnaire such as medical conditions or problems related with the adherence to the MD.&#xD;
      Moreover, participants will receive detailed written information of the study and the&#xD;
      informed consent that they have to sign. The nurse will perform a venipuncture to obtain a&#xD;
      blood sample according to the normal protocol. Moreover, in a subsample of the sample the&#xD;
      participants will be instructed to collect a stool sample. Finally, all the data will be&#xD;
      transferred to the dietitians of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dietitians of the study will be responsible for the periodic contact with the&#xD;
      participants and to perform the nutritional intervention and follow-up. Contacts will be made&#xD;
      through new technologies such as a web platform, a mobile app, telephone and email.&#xD;
      Additionally, if a participant is not familiarized with these technologies, the dieticians&#xD;
      will use postal mail to send all the information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RANDOMIZATION AND INTERVENTION The study dietitians will perform the randomization of the&#xD;
      participants to the corresponding intervention group following tables of random allocation&#xD;
      according to the recruitment order balanced by age, group, and recruitment center. The&#xD;
      randomization process will be performed from the coordination center. The psychiatrists who&#xD;
      will perform mental evaluation of the participants will not participate in the process of&#xD;
      randomization to avoid knowing to which group has been assigned each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MD groups The protocol used in this trial is similar to that applied in the PREDIMED trial.&#xD;
      In fact, the dietitians of this trial have participated in the PREDIMED trial and are&#xD;
      collaborating also in the PREDIMED-PLUS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MD group will receive EVOO (A 1-liter free supply every 2 weeks) or TN (20 grams per&#xD;
      day).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the beginning of the trial the dietitian will provide a comprehensive number of reasons to&#xD;
      adopt a MD to each participant, and will negotiate a change in his/her diet, working with the&#xD;
      subject to determine what he or she considers an attainable goal. This compliance degree will&#xD;
      be assessed every 3 months by the dietician through a telephone call to the participants.&#xD;
      Every 3 months participants will also receive information about food items typical of the MD&#xD;
      and adapted to the season of the year, a quantitative 1-week buying list of food items&#xD;
      according to the season of the year, a weekly plan of meals (with detailed menus) adapted to&#xD;
      the buying list and cooking recipes for cuisine practices according to the suggested menus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Web page and mobile app will be updated each week with news related MD and its health&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any doubt or suggestion made by our participants will be taken into account by our dietitians&#xD;
      at any moment of the intervention period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group Control group will not receive any kind of nutritional intervention although&#xD;
      these participants will have an email and access to the project web page but with some limits&#xD;
      for contents related with the intervention. To avoid losses during follow-up in the group,&#xD;
      these participants will receive some incentives such as cinema tickets or discount vouchers&#xD;
      in supermarkets&#xD;
&#xD;
      INFORMATION ASSESSMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. MINI interview To assess mental disorders diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale questionnaire (Med Clin 2002;118:493-9) To&#xD;
           assess depressive symptoms severity&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Eligibility questionnaire: to assess presence of severe diseases, food allergies and&#xD;
           assessment of the willingness to make diet changes (Prochaska model)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Baseline general and follow-up questionnaires: Socio-economic, anthropometric and&#xD;
           life-style variables and diagnosis of diseases and use of psychotherapy and medication&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Conformity to the Mediterranean diet questionnaire (J Nutr 2011; 141:1140-5)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (Br J Nutr 2010;103:1808-16)&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Minnesota physical activity questionnaire (Am J Epidemiol 1994;139:1197-209)&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. SF-36 quality of life questionnaire (Gac Sanit 2005;19 :135-50)&#xD;
&#xD;
      A clinical interview will be administered to discard a diagnosis of depression at baseline.&#xD;
      This interview will be repeated every year. Coinciding with the medical visit blood&#xD;
      extraction will be performed every year. Stool samples will be collected in a subsample both&#xD;
      in the beginning and at the end of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every four months psychiatrists will administer the Montgomery-Asberg questionnaire by&#xD;
      telephone except in the beginning of the study or once a year in which the questionnaire will&#xD;
      administer face to face in the consulting room. If there is any suspicion of depression&#xD;
      reported by the psychiatrist after the telephone interview or reported by any patient&#xD;
      relative the participants will be cited to attend the consulting room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The adherence to the MD, nutrient and food intake, physical activity and quality of life will&#xD;
      be assessed through validated questionnaires that were already used in the PREDIMED trial.&#xD;
      The dietitians will collect information on diet, physical activity, quality of life and&#xD;
      medical and life-style variables at baseline and yearly using new technologies, and the&#xD;
      telephone.&#xD;
