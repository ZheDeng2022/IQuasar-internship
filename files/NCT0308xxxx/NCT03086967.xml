      The Foley catheter is a safe, effective method for cervical ripening. Limited data exists to&#xD;
      indicate ideal time of placement for optimal cervical ripening prior to induction. The&#xD;
      proposed study is a randomized control trial to determine if shortening placement from 12 to&#xD;
      6 hours of foley catheter can decrease time from start of induction to delivery. The&#xD;
      prediction is that shortening foley bulb placement will result in shorter induction times,&#xD;
      increased patient satisfaction and decreased length of stay on labor and delivery with&#xD;
      secondary decreased medical costs.&#xD;

      Objective: To determine whether a double-lumen balloon catheter requires twelve hours in the&#xD;
      cervical canal to achieve its maximal cervical dilation. It is the hypothesis that the&#xD;
      maximum cervical dilation and benefits of a double lumen foley catheter are achieved within&#xD;
      the initial six hours after placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overview: All eligible patients with a singleton pregnancy at 37 weeks gestational age or&#xD;
      greater who are presenting for a clinically/ medically indicated induction with an&#xD;
      unfavorable cervical exam will be invited to participate.. As per the ACOG guidelines, all&#xD;
      inductions performed prior to 39 weeks are medically indicated. Medical indications for&#xD;
      induction prior to 39 weeks include but are not limited to preeclampsia, oligohydramnios and&#xD;
      growth restriction. Upon admission to Labor and Delivery, women will be assessed for&#xD;
      eligibility by an obstetric physician. A digital cervical examination will be performed and a&#xD;
      Bishop score assigned. Patients with a Bishop score â‰¤ 6 are thought to benefit from a&#xD;
      cervical ripening agent and the participants will be randomized based on parity at this&#xD;
      point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type of Study: This study will be a prospective, randomized clinical control trial with human&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Intrauterine pregnancy at 37 weeks gestational age or greater as determined by best&#xD;
           obstetrical dating criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Singleton gestation&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Vertex presentation&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Clinically adequate pelvis&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Bishop Score less than or equal to 6&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. 16 years and older NC state law provides for the emancipation of minors, Chapter&#xD;
           7B-Article 35.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Any maternal or fetal contraindication to vaginal delivery&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Known uterine anomaly&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Multifetal gestation&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Estimated fetal weight of 4500 gm or greater&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Ruptured membranes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A qualified obstetric provider will provide eligible women with details of the study,&#xD;
      including study objectives and methods. Consent will be obtained and witnessed from patients&#xD;
      who elect to participate. Enrollment and randomization in the study will then occur. Patients&#xD;
      will be randomized to the two groups using computer generated random numbers. The&#xD;
      randomization will be stratified based on parity (i.e., women who have had any prior vaginal&#xD;
      delivery above 20 weeks gestation v. women who have not). A foley bulb will then be placed by&#xD;
      a qualified obstetric provider. Foley bulb will be inserted with or without speculum&#xD;
      technique and with or without use of a stylet. In accordance with the standard of care,&#xD;
      sterile saline will be placed in the intrauterine and vaginal balloon as tolerated by the&#xD;
      patient for no more than a maximum of 80 cc in each balloon. The use of concomitant low dose&#xD;
      pitocin with the foley bulb will be at the discretion of the admitting obstetric team. If the&#xD;
      patient's foley bulb does not spontaneously expel within the maximum allotted time, they will&#xD;
      be manually removed at six or twelve hours. At the time of manual removal or expulsion of the&#xD;
      foley balloon, the patient's cervix will be checked by an experienced obstetric provider. As&#xD;
      per usual protocol, additional cervical ripening and labor induction will proceed per&#xD;
      managing obstetric team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Independent Variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection will include the independent variables of maternal age, parity, BMI, race&#xD;
      (Caucasian, African American, Hispanic, Asian, other), Bishop Score, use of magnesium and&#xD;
      epidural use. Data collection of independent fetal variables will include gestational age and&#xD;
      estimated fetal weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be time from foley bulb placement to time of delivery. Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes will include time from foley bulb placement to extrusion and rate of cesarean&#xD;
      section. Additional comparison variables include: neonatal weight, APGAR scores and&#xD;
      intrapartum and postpartum infection rates.&#xD;
