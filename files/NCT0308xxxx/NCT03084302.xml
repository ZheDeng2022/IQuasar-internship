    <textblock>
      The investigators will study sedentary behavior (SED) across pregnancy in young women. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that SED will increase across pregnancy and that higher SED will be related to&#xD;
      worse cardiovascular health, specifically elevated blood pressure (BP) and excessive&#xD;
      gestational weight gain (GWG). Pregnancy is a biologically relevant period during which CVD&#xD;
      risk factors may develop or worsen, contributing to future CVD. Pregnant women also spend&#xD;
      most of their day sedentary, which is defined as too much sitting as distinct from too little&#xD;
      exercise. SED has emerged as a risk factor, independent from moderate-to-vigorous physical&#xD;
      activity (e.g., exercise), for elevated BP, obesity, diabetes, CVD, and mortality in general&#xD;
      populations, but there are no recommendations for SED during pregnancy and few studies&#xD;
      evaluate SED across pregnancy. These few studies are limited by small sample size, lack of&#xD;
      repeated measures across trimesters, suboptimal SED assessment methodology, and a failure to&#xD;
      link with clinical outcomes (e.g., BP, GWG). The investigators will address these gaps in a&#xD;
      prospective study that will measure SED in 130 pregnant women across three trimesters using&#xD;
      state-of-the-art objective activity monitors capable of measuring min-by-min activity by both&#xD;
      intensity and posture. We will also measure BP and GWG during each trimester and, further,&#xD;
      will link to and abstract all prenatal clinic weights and BPs, glucose screening results,&#xD;
      gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, and adverse birth outcomes. Lastly, with the long-term&#xD;
      goal of identifying women at high risk of SED during pregnancy and designing effective&#xD;
      interventions, the investigators will efficiently evaluate correlates and determinants of SED&#xD;
      which have never been studied during pregnancy.&#xD;

      Objective: The investigators aim to conduct a prospective cohort study using&#xD;
      state-of-the-art, noninvasive measurement of sedentary behavior in n=130 pregnant women&#xD;
      during each trimester of their first pregnancy. We will link sedentary behavior to&#xD;
      gestational weight gain, blood pressure, and potential determinants such as demographics,&#xD;
      health conditions and behaviors, psychosocial factors, perceptions/beliefs, and the&#xD;
      environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Objectively measure sedentary behavior across pregnancy trimesters Aim 2: Relate&#xD;
      objectively-measured sedentary behavior to blood pressure and gestational weight gain across&#xD;
      pregnancy Aim 3: Characterize correlates and determinants of sedentary behavior during&#xD;
      pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.3 Background: Cardiovacular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death in women with&#xD;
      minimal declines over the past 30 years among women &lt;55 years old. Stagnant rates of CVD&#xD;
      mortality in younger women have occurred alongside notable declines in men and older adults&#xD;
      and are thought to be due, in part, to high rates of obesity and elevated blood pressure&#xD;
      (BP). Related to this, the American Heart Association (AHA) recently identified primordial&#xD;
      prevention, a population-level approach that targets preventing rather than treating CVD risk&#xD;
      factors, as a necessary strategy to reduce the CVD burden. To achieve primordial prevention,&#xD;
      the target must be populations at risk for developing CVD risk factors (vs. those with&#xD;
      existing risk factors), such as younger women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnancy is a biologically unique period for young women during which CVD risk factors such&#xD;
      as obesity and high blood pressure (BP) can develop or worsen, contributing to future CVD.&#xD;
      Pregnant women also spend most of their time in sedentary behavior (SED). SED is any behavior&#xD;
      that occurs in a seated/reclining position with low energy expenditure and is now recognized&#xD;
      as a behavior that is distinct from inactivity, or a lack of moderate-vigorous physical&#xD;
      activity (MVPA). Though MVPA has known benefits, SED is an emerging, independent risk factor&#xD;
      for obesity, CVD, and mortality. Importantly, prolonged bouts of SED (accumulated in bouts&#xD;
      lasting 30 min or more) in non-pregnant persons are more strongly related to obesity and&#xD;
      induce unfavorable hemodynamic responses, such as increased BP. We hypothesize that too much&#xD;
      SED across pregnancy is an important contributor to excess gestational weight gain (GWG) and&#xD;
      elevated BP, two important CVD risk factors in young women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Remarkably, a dearth of studies evaluates SED across pregnancy. In cross-sectional studies,&#xD;
      pregnant women spend 50-60% of their day in SED and SED is highest in the 3rd trimester. Yet,&#xD;
      no study has evaluated if SED increases across pregnancy (repeated measurements) using best&#xD;
      practice SED assessment methodology (objective device capable of capturing posture and&#xD;
      intensity). Moreover, no study has evaluated whether greater SED is associated with increased&#xD;
      GWG and BP in pregnant women, which in turn are known to impact pregnancy health and later&#xD;
      maternal CVD risk. Current guidelines only advise MVPA for pregnant women with no&#xD;
      recommendations about SED, highlighting the research gaps about SED and its consequences&#xD;
      during pregnancy. Moreover, clarifying the role of SED in pregnancy is important because&#xD;
      lowering SED might be a feasible strategy for pregnant women, who have low participation in9&#xD;
      and unique barriers to MVPA. Lastly, little is known about correlates and determinants of SED&#xD;
      in pregnancy. Such data are critical for identifying women at risk for high SED during&#xD;
      pregnancy and for developing effective interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.4 Significance: Sedentary behavior is a novel risk factor for weight gain, high BP, and&#xD;
      CVD, yet patterns, correlates, determinants and consequences of sedentary behavior are poorly&#xD;
      understood in pregnant women. Sedentary behavior is the most common behavior in pregnant&#xD;
      women, but the dearth of research studies applying state-of-the-art sedentary behavior&#xD;
      assessment methods and with repeated measures across pregnancy is a major research gap that&#xD;
      we intend to address with this proposal. To the investigators' knowledge, no studies with&#xD;
      optimal sedentary behavior measurement, assessing both posture and intensity while awake&#xD;
      (i.e., activPAL), have been conducted in pregnant women. Beyond this, few studies have&#xD;
      evaluated temporal trends in sedentary time across gestation. There is no research examining&#xD;
      bouts of extended, uninterrupted sedentary time which have particularly deleterious effects&#xD;
      on BP and are more strongly related to high BMI. Lastly, correlates and determinants of&#xD;
      sedentary behavior are poorly understood overall and, in particular, among pregnant women.&#xD;
      Before effective interventions can be designed to reduce sedentary behavior in pregnancy,&#xD;
      nonmodifiable and modifiable factors associated with sedentary behavior must be better&#xD;
      understood. Thus, the objective, longitudinal measurement of sedentary behavior in pregnancy&#xD;
      proposed in this application will determine patterns, correlates, determinants, and&#xD;
      consequences of sedentary behavior in pregnancy to move toward future goals of 1) clarifying&#xD;
      risks and whether sedentary behavior recommendations are appropriate for pregnant women, 2)&#xD;
      identifying groups at risk for high sedentary behavior, and 3) informing intervention&#xD;
      targets. Further, this research addresses the AHA's mission to reduce the burden of CVD by&#xD;
      investigating a novel strategy for primordial prevention of cardiovascular disease in young&#xD;
      women.&#xD;
