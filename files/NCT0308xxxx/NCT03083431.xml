  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Extremely premature infants are at risk of developing a potentially blinding eye disease,&#xD;
      called retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). Currently available treatment, consisting of laser&#xD;
      surgery or injection of drugs into the eye balls, may prevent most but not all cases of&#xD;
      permanent ROP-mediated blindness. Both types of treatment are associated with significant&#xD;
      costs and side effects. An orally administered drug commonly used to treat hypertension,&#xD;
      propranolol, may be effective in halting progression of ROP to severe stages, as suggested by&#xD;
      preliminary data from two small studies. Propranolol has been used for decades not only in&#xD;
      adult patients but also in newborn infants with heart diseases. Moreover, it has been&#xD;
      licensed in 2014 for the use in newborn infants with hemangiomas in the European Union,&#xD;
      Switzerland and the United States. As severe (threshold) ROP is an overall rare disease, the&#xD;
      effectiveness of propranolol in combating ROP can only be assessed in a large, multicenter&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial involving hospitals caring for extremely preterm infants of&#xD;
      diverse origin.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Threshold Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP), observed in a fraction of extremely premature&#xD;
      infants, is characterized by retinal vessel proliferation that threatens vision secondary to&#xD;
      retinal detachment. Currently available treatments (ablative laser surgery or intravitreal&#xD;
      anti-VEGF injections) may prevent most but not all cases of permanent ROP-mediated blindness&#xD;
      and are associated with significant costs and side effects. Orally administered propranolol,&#xD;
      a commonly used drug to treat hypertension, may be effective in halting progression of ROP to&#xD;
      severe stages, as suggested by preliminary data from two small studies. Propranolol has been&#xD;
      used for decades not only in adult patients but also in newborn infants with heart diseases.&#xD;
      Moreover, it has been licensed in 2014 for the use in newborn infants with hemangiomas in the&#xD;
      European Union, Switzerland and the United States. This multicenter randomized&#xD;
      placebo-controlled trial aims to assess whether oral propranolol given to extremely premature&#xD;
      infants below 28 weeks gestational age reduces the rates of threshold ROP.&#xD;
