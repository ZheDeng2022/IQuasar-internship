      OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have been treated with a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor and experienced a PFS of ≥3&#xD;
      months will be enrolled within 6 weeks of last dose of PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor. On Day 1 of&#xD;
      each 3-week cycle, subjects will first receive pembrolizumab at a dose of 200mg IV every&#xD;
      three weeks in combination with chemotherapy. Partner chemotherapy will be either gemcitabine&#xD;
      1000mg/m2 IV D1 and D8 every three weeks, docetaxel 75mg/m2 IV D1 every three weeks, or&#xD;
      pemetrexed 500mg/m2 IV D1 every 3 weeks (pemetrexed for non-squamous histologies only).&#xD;
      Subjects will continue to receive this combination until progression or intolerable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Administration Sequence: First Sequence&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Pembrolizumab 200mg IV on Day 1 (cycle = 21 days)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Administration Sequence: Second Sequence&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gemcitabine 1000mg/m^2 IV on Days 1,8 (cycle = 21 days)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Docetaxel 75mg/^2 IV on Days 1,8 (cycle = 21 days)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pemetrexed 500mg/m^2 IV on Day 1 (cycle -= 21 days)&#xD;
