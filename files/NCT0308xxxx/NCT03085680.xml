  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This placebo-controlled RCT tests whether dietary supplementation with curcumin maintains or&#xD;
      improves cognitive and physical function in older adults who are at high risk of functional&#xD;
      decline due existing (mild) functional impairments and elevated biomarkers of inflammation&#xD;
      and explore the association between functional changes and changes in biological indicators&#xD;
      of active inflammation.&#xD;
