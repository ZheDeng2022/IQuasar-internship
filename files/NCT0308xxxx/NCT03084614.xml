      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      When a person is exposed to something that causes an infection, the body sends a type of cell&#xD;
      called CD8 T cells to attack it. Those cells are also found in breast milk. Nursing mothers&#xD;
      pass these cells to their child, which helps the child fight infections, too. Researchers&#xD;
      want to learn more about how CD8 cells work to keep people healthy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn more about how the human body fights off infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People age 18 years and older who either have an infection, are suspected to have an&#xD;
      infection, or recently got a vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The household contacts of these people and people who have not been recently exposed to any&#xD;
      infection are also needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a medical and health history and physical exam. They may&#xD;
      have blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first study visit can be the same day as screening. It can be up to 3 months later. For&#xD;
      those visits, screening tests will be repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the first visit, participants will have blood collected from an arm vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who are breastfeeding may provide a small sample of breast milk. They may&#xD;
      collect it at home or bring a pumping device to NIH to collect it. NIH can also provide a&#xD;
      breast pump.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may be contacted for up to 1 year after the first visit to give samples of blood&#xD;
      and/or breast milk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 4 additional visits, which will each take about 1 hour, may be scheduled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A personal physician or local lab can collect blood from participants and ship it to NIH.&#xD;
      Breast milk cannot be shipped.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Cellular lysates from purified protein derivative-positive donors have been reported to&#xD;
      transfer tuberculin reactivity to na(SqrRoot) ve recipients, but not diphtheria reactivity;&#xD;
      similarly, cell lysates from diphtheria-reactive donors appear to transfer diphtheria&#xD;
      reactivity without impacting responses to tuberculin. A historically controversial topic, the&#xD;
      terms transfer factor and dialyzed leukocyte extract were used to characterize the&#xD;
      reactivity-transferring properties of lysates. We found that the cellular extract derived&#xD;
      from antigen-specific memory CD8+ T cells induces interleukin (IL)-6 from antigen-matched&#xD;
      antigen-presenting cells. This ultimately elicits IL-17 from bystander memory CD8+ T cells.&#xD;
      We identified that dialyzable peptide sequences, S100a9, and the TCR &lt;= chain from CD8+ T&#xD;
      cells contribute to the molecular nature of this activity. We further showed that extracts&#xD;
      from antigen-targeted T cells enhance immunity to Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans.&#xD;
      The observed anti-Candida activity of lysates was enhanced when the cells were taken from&#xD;
      individuals with higher-than-average exposure to Candida and correlated with increased&#xD;
      numbers of Candida-reactive T-cells. These effects are sensitive to immunization protocols&#xD;
      and extraction methodology in ways that may explain past discrepancies in the reproducibility&#xD;
      of passive cellular immunity. Work by other groups has revealed that memory CD8+ T cells are&#xD;
      also the only cell population enriched in breast milk as compared to an equal volume of&#xD;
      peripheral blood. Taken together, it may be that the CD8+ memory T cells in breast milk serve&#xD;
      as a mechanism of passive cellular immunity transference from mother to offspring. We thus&#xD;
      aim to expand our analysis into the potential that lysates taken from sources with enriched&#xD;
      immunity against a given microorganism will induce greater in vivo and mouse model activity&#xD;
      compared to lysates from non-immune sources, and that this difference in lysate activity will&#xD;
      be directly related to the CD8+ T cell enrichment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we will collect blood and/or breast milk samples from donors with known or&#xD;
      suspected exposure to pathogens, and also from healthy non-exposed volunteers. Research&#xD;
      evaluations of samples will be done for the relevant microbe(s) of interest. The volume of&#xD;
      blood taken from lacting mothers will be limited to 20mL or less per visit. Cells may be&#xD;
      proliferated, immortalized, lysed and dialyzed, and/or stored. Cellular lysates will&#xD;
      subsequently be used in both in vitro and pre-clinical animal models to assess for&#xD;
      therapeutic potential.&#xD;

&#xD;
                  -Exposure has been verifiably documented (eg, receiving an immunization or DNCB&#xD;
                  sensitization treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
                  OR&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -Clinical history is consistent with established epidemiology of the microbe of&#xD;
                  interest (eg, documentation of past infection; or to a lesser priority travel to&#xD;
                  endemic areas or living with an individual that suffers from chronic infection&#xD;
                  with the targeted microbe).&#xD;
&#xD;
                  AND&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -Positive results on established clinical immunity tests (eg, viral RNA, antibody&#xD;
                  titers, etc).&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Suspected exposure: Clinical history is consistent with established epidemiology&#xD;
                  of the microbe of interest (eg, travel to endemic areas, documentation of past&#xD;
                  infection) but no established clinical assay exists to verify exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Non-exposed: Absence of exposure to targeted microorganisms as measured by lack&#xD;
                  of exposure to infected individuals, lack of travel to endemic areas, no&#xD;
                  immunization history, negative screening tests, or other methods of establishing&#xD;
                  exposure history to mucosal microbial agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Active use of immunosuppressive medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, contraindicates participation&#xD;
             in this study.&#xD;
