  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, patients undergoing live donor kidney transplantation will be allocated to the&#xD;
      control group or remote ischemic preconditioning group (RIPC). RIPC is the utilization of&#xD;
      short periods of ischemia to provide protection of the myocardium or other organ (i.e.&#xD;
      kidney) from a subsequent ischemic event. Before allograft implantation, RIPC will be&#xD;
      accomplished in the recipient and donor by inducing intermittent extremity ischemia through&#xD;
      intermittent inflation of an extremity tourniquet three times for five-minute intervals with&#xD;
      five minutes of deflation between inflation periods. The monitored clinical end points will&#xD;
      include total urine output following kidney reperfusion over five days, plasma creatinine&#xD;
      declination over five days, initiation of dialysis, and development of graft injury.&#xD;
      Magnitude of graft injury is the primary endpoint and will be measured using biochemical&#xD;
      markers, such as, plasma and urinary concentration of neutrophil gelatinase associated&#xD;
      lipocalin (NGAL), IL-18, and KIM-1. The sample size calculation is based on a projected&#xD;
      difference of NGAL levels between the two study arms. Hall et al reported a mean NGAL level&#xD;
      of 49 mg/mL (SD = 37 mg/mL) for a group of patients that had immediate graph function and a&#xD;
      mean NGAL level of 248 mg/mL in a group of patients with slow graft function. (which Hall&#xD;
      reference is this) Based on these data, a conservative estimate of a mean difference between&#xD;
      study groups will be considered 35 mg/mL NGAL. Using these assumptions, an alpha level of&#xD;
      0.05 and 80% power, a sample size of n= 19 per study group will be calculated. By rejecting&#xD;
      our null hypothesis, RIPC may serve as a safe, cost-effective protective strategy to prevent&#xD;
      allograft injury in the clinical setting of live donor kidney transplantation.&#xD;

      All female patients of childbearing age that qualify for this study will receive a urinary&#xD;
      pregnancy test prior to enrollment. Application of a tourniquet will occur after induction of&#xD;
      anesthesia and intubation with minimal possibility of causing discomfort as the patient will&#xD;
      be anesthetized. The tourniquet will be applied preferably to a leg but an arm will be used&#xD;
      if a leg is unavailable. The tourniquet will be inflated for three 5 minute intervals over a&#xD;
      30 minute period of time using the Zimmer A.T.S. 2000 Tourniquet System. Patients will be&#xD;
      randomly allocated to one of two groups. The experimental group will have the tourniquet&#xD;
      inflated on the leg or arm to 200 mmHg. The control group will have the tourniquet inflated&#xD;
      on the leg or arm to only 20 mmHg. An audible timer will be used to help alert investigators&#xD;
      that the tourniquet is in need of deflation after each 5-minute interval. The tourniquet will&#xD;
      be removed after the needed 30 minutes of inflation/deflation to prevent inadvertent&#xD;
      inflation of the tourniquet. Blood and Urine specimens will be labeled with patient name and&#xD;
      medical record number. Urine samples will be taken in the operating room and at 6,12,24,48&#xD;
      hours postoperatively to test for urinary biomarkers at the O'Brien Clinical Research Center.&#xD;
      Blood samples for calculation of serum blood urea nitrogen and creatinine will be&#xD;
      collected/processed/distributed/stored according to current UAB main laboratory guidelines as&#xD;
      this test is routinely ordered on renal transplant patients. Urinary biomarker laboratory&#xD;
      testing samples will be obtained by a bedside nurse placed in a routine urine sample&#xD;
      container and a co-investigator will then bring samples to the laboratory where the samples&#xD;
      will be tested for NGAL, KIM-1, and IL-18. Blood samples will be taken daily for the first 5&#xD;
      days. A blood sample will be taken from the patient at 1 month to determine the serum blood&#xD;
      urea nitrogen level and the creatinine level. The degree of allograft injury will be assessed&#xD;
      by the levels of urinary biomarkers NGAL, IL-18, and KIM-1. Incidence of allograft or&#xD;
      transplanted kidney primary malfunction will be based on urine output during the first three&#xD;
      days after transplantation, the one month serum creatinine concentration, one month estimated&#xD;
      glomerular filtration rate calculated according to diet modification. Additional secondary&#xD;
      endpoints include 90-day mortality, length of ICU stay, and length of hospital stay. There is&#xD;
      a low probability of tourniquet postoperative pain secondary to time of tourniquet inflation&#xD;
      being both intermittent and for a short period of time. Inconvenience includes phone&#xD;
      discussions with researchers/coordinators and preoperative discussions addressing risks and&#xD;
      benefits of the study. Tourniquets will not be placed on extremities with preexisting&#xD;
      arteriovenous fistulas or grafts utilized for hemodialysis. In addition, tourniquets will be&#xD;
      placed after oscillometric blood pressure cuff placement for intraoperative&#xD;
      anesthesia/surgical monitoring to provide adequate patient blood pressure assessment. The&#xD;
      tourniquet will not be placed on the same extremity as the oscillometric blood pressure cuff.&#xD;
      The primary investigator or a co-investigator will be present during times of tourniquet&#xD;
      inflation. The patient will be assessed for complications immediately after tourniquet&#xD;
      removal, in the PACU, and in the ICU/or step down unit. Finally, patient complication&#xD;
      assessment will occur on the transplant floor after effects of anesthesia have completely&#xD;
      resolved within 24 hours of tourniquet application. The extremity will also be assessed for&#xD;
      injury at the 1-month follow up visit.&#xD;
