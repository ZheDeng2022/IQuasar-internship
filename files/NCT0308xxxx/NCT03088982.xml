      Background :The European General Practitioners Research Network (EGPRN) designed and&#xD;
      validated a comprehensive definition of multimorbidity using a systematic literature review&#xD;
      and qualitative research throughout Europe. This survey assessed which criteria in the EGPRN&#xD;
      concept of multimorbidity could detect decompensating patients in residential care within a&#xD;
      primary care cohort at a 6-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: Family Physicians included all multimorbid patients encountered in their residential&#xD;
      care homes from July to December 2014. Inclusion criteria were those of the EGPRN definition&#xD;
      of Multimorbidity. Exclusion criteria were patients under legal protection and those unable&#xD;
      to complete the 2-year follow-up. Decompensation was defined as the occurrence of death or&#xD;
      hospitalization for more than seven days. Statistical analysis was undertaken with uni- and&#xD;
      multivariate analysis at a 6-month follow-up using a combination of approaches including both&#xD;
      automatic classification and expert decision making. A Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA)&#xD;
      and a Hierarchical Clustering on Principal Components (HCPC) confirmed the consistency of the&#xD;
      results. Finally a logistic regression was performed in order to identify and quantify risk&#xD;
      factors for decompensation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The concept of multimorbidity was first published in 1976. Multimorbidity has been defined by&#xD;
      the World Health Organization (WHO) as people being affected by two or more chronic health&#xD;
      conditions. Multimorbidity is a very interesting and challenging concept particularly for&#xD;
      Family Medicine (FM), given the increasing prevalence of chronic illness in an aging&#xD;
      population across all developed countries. It is closely related to a global or comprehensive&#xD;
      view of the patient, which is a core competency of FM, as defined, for instance, by the World&#xD;
      Organization of National Colleges, Academies and Academic Associations of General&#xD;
      Practitioners/Family Physicians (WONCA). It is a global 'functional' view (useful for&#xD;
      Long-Term Care) versus a 'disease' centered point of view (useful for acute care).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The European General Practice Research Network (EGPRN) has created a research agenda&#xD;
      specifically designed for methodological and instrumental research, which includes the&#xD;
      development of primary care epidemiology, focusing on patient-centered health. A&#xD;
      comprehensive definition of the concept of multimorbidity (i.e. one which is both&#xD;
      understandable and usable for further collaborative research) was an important objective for&#xD;
      this research network. The objective was to help researchers in FM to investigate the&#xD;
      complexity of patients' conditions and their overall impact on patients' health. This concept&#xD;
      of multimorbidity could be an additional tool for Family Physicians (FPs), enabling them to&#xD;
      prevent decompensation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A research team, including 9 national groups, all active within the EGPRN, has created a&#xD;
      research community for the purpose of clarifying the concept of multimorbidity for FM&#xD;
      throughout Europe. This group produced a comprehensive definition of the concept of&#xD;
      multimorbidity through a systematic review of literature. This concept was translated into&#xD;
      most European languages for use in further collaborative research. Finally, it was validated&#xD;
      using qualitative research throughout Europe and a specific research agenda was issued. The&#xD;
      EGPRN concept of multimorbidity included a set of different variables assessing patients'&#xD;
      multimorbidity, multimorbidity modulating factors and multimorbidity consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Decompensation (i.e. death or hospitalization in acute care) is a challenge for FM as FPs,&#xD;
      being familiar with their patient's health status, could miss tiny factors which, if noticed,&#xD;
      could help to prevent decompensation. A predictive model that could be integrated into their&#xD;
      clinical practice could help them to prevent decompensation and avoid serious health outcomes&#xD;
      for their patients. The EGPRN concept of multimorbidity was considered highly suitable for a&#xD;
      purpose such as this. It could lead to a usable model for preventing decompensation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The French population is aging, with one in three people over 60 years of age in 2050.&#xD;
      Consequently, the number of dependent patients, some requiring institutionalization in Care&#xD;
      homes (CHs), is growing. Patients residing in CHs are included in the EGPRN definition of&#xD;
      multimorbidity. In France, as in most European countries, patients in residential care are&#xD;
      treated by FPs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this research was to assess which criteria in the EGPRN concept of&#xD;
      multimorbidity could detect decompensating patients in residential care within a primary care&#xD;
      cohort at a 6-month follow-up.&#xD;

    <description>FPs who had agreed to participate worked according to the following plan: first, the multimorbid patient was asked to give his/her consent to participate in the study once the terms had been explained to him/her. After that, FPs completed a questionnaire about their patient.&#xD;
The purpose of this questionnaire was to explore potential decompensation risk factors within the themes and subthemes of multimorbidity.</description>
