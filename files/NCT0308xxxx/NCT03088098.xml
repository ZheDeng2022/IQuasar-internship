      Study category and Rationale Clinical study, Category A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Phase: Post market study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background and Rationale: Left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) allows avoiding oral&#xD;
      anticoagulation and provides at the same time an at least equally good protection from&#xD;
      strokes and peripheral embolism. It may therefore be an attractive alternative to oral&#xD;
      anticoagulation in the patient population undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation&#xD;
      (TAVI): the concept of LAAO is based on the fact that thrombus formation in atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation occurs in &gt;90% in the left atrial appendage (LAA). Mechanical occlusion of the&#xD;
      LAA reduces the stroke risk by eliminating the source of thrombus formation. In the here&#xD;
      proposed &quot;Randomized Comparison of Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion versus Standard Medical&#xD;
      Therapy in Patients in Atrial Fibrillation Undergoing Transfemoral Transcatheter Aortic Valve&#xD;
      Implantation&quot;, study we test the hypothesis, that LAAO is superior to standard medical&#xD;
      therapy in the high-risk TAVI population. This hypothesis has not been investigated by&#xD;
      previous studies so far.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall Objective(s): Overall objective: to compare the safety (and efficacy) of LAAO using&#xD;
      the St. Jude left atrial appendage closure device with standard medical therapy in a&#xD;
      prospective, multi-center, randomized trial in patients undergoing TAVI in routine clinical&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: To assess the safety of the device intervention with regard to stroke&#xD;
      prevention and prevention of bleeding complications in a patients population at high risk of&#xD;
      stroke and bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives: Short-term (procedural) safety of device intervention is assessed (rate&#xD;
      of successful deployment of a left atrial appendage occluder; rate of kidney failure). As a&#xD;
      further secondary objective, long-term effects of device intervention on stroke and bleeding&#xD;
      prevention as well as mortality are assessed and compared to medical therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome(s): Primary: Composite endpoint of ischemic and hemorrhagic neurologic events,&#xD;
      peripheral embolism, life-threatening/disabling and major bleeding complications and&#xD;
      cardiovascular mortality at 1 year&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary: All deaths (cardiac and non-cardiac) at 30 days, 1, 3, and 5 years Device success&#xD;
      at 30 days&#xD;
&#xD;
      In-hospital acute kidney injury (AKI)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: An investigator-initiated, randomized, multicenter, non-blinded, all-comers&#xD;
      study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements and Procedures: 80 patients in atrial fibrillation undergoing TAVI will be&#xD;
      randomized in a non-blinded fashion (1:1 randomization) to LAAO (device group) or SMT at the&#xD;
      operators' discretion (medical group; antiplatelet therapy and oral anticoagulation or oral&#xD;
      anticoagulation alone). All patients will be followed for up to 5 years. The primary analysis&#xD;
      will be performed at 30 days and after completion of a 1-year follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      80 patients in atrial fibrillation undergoing TAVI will be randomized in a non-blinded&#xD;

      operators' discretion (medical group; antiplatelet therapy, oral anticoagulation or oral&#xD;
      anticoagulation alone).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimated duration for the main investigational plan from start of screening of first&#xD;
      participant to last participant processed and finishing the study: 6 years&#xD;

      Background and Rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is a minimally invasive treatment option for&#xD;
      patients suffering from severe symptomatic aortic stenosis. Superiority of TAVI over medical&#xD;
      treatment has been shown in the randomized PARTNER B trial followed by the PARTNER A trial&#xD;
      showing non-inferiority over a more invasive open-heart surgical aortic valve replacement in&#xD;
      high-risk patients. Over the last years, many patients have been successfully treated with&#xD;
      TAVI worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peri- and post-procedural morbidity differed considerably between the surgical and&#xD;
      interventional treatment group in the PARTNER A trial: while major bleeding (19.5% vs 9.3% at&#xD;
      30 days) and new onset atrial fibrillation (16% vs 8.6% at 30 days) occur more often in&#xD;
      surgically treated patients, vascular access complications (3.8 vs 17% at 30 days) and&#xD;
      neurologic events (5.5% vs 2.4% at 30 days) are more frequently encountered in the TAVI&#xD;
      population. The higher rate of neurologic events in the TAVI group was of particular concern,&#xD;
      given its association with a higher mortality and the clinical impact of major neurologic&#xD;
      events on patient's quality of life and daily functioning. Only about 40-50% of strokes occur&#xD;
      intra-procedurally, followed by a higher hazard rate in the first week and a constant hazard&#xD;
      thereafter. After 30 months, the surgical group experienced a numerically higher stroke rate,&#xD;
      although not statistically significant. Measures to reduce procedural and post-procedural&#xD;
      stroke rate were and are still looked for.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While procedural strokes can be most likely reduced by improvements in valve delivery systems&#xD;
      (smaller delivery systems) and more operator experience, cerebral protection devices are&#xD;
      currently tested in trials but preliminary results are rather disappointing. Risk factors for&#xD;
      post-procedural strokes after TAVI are a previous history of stroke, more extensive&#xD;
      peripheral vascular disease, and higher functional class.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subgroup of patients of particular concern are patients suffering from atrial fibrillation:&#xD;
      predictor of early (day 1-30) cerebrovascular events was new-onset atrial fibrillation (OR&#xD;
      2.76), whereas chronic atrial fibrillation was a predictor (OR 2.84) for the occurrence of&#xD;
      late (&gt;30 days) cerebrovascular events. Amat-Santos reported a higher rate of&#xD;
      strokes/systemic embolism in patients with in hospital new onset atrial fibrillation after&#xD;
      TAVI (13.6% vs 3.2% after 30 days). Patients diagnosed with new onset atrial fibrillation&#xD;
      during or after the procedure in which no anticoagulation was initiated experienced an&#xD;
      alarmingly high 30-day stroke rate of 40%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite these results and the high prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF) of about 33% in the&#xD;
      overall TAVI population, only 30% of AF patients were on vitamin K antagonists (VKA) before,&#xD;
      and only 70% after TAVI. While oral anticoagulation is an effective medical treatment for&#xD;
      ischemic stroke prevention in these patients, it is often withheld from patients given their&#xD;
      high risk of bleeding. TAVI patients typically not only suffer from much co-morbidity and are&#xD;
      poly-medicated, but also suffer from a lot of bleeding risk factors. The bleeding risk score&#xD;
      (HASBLED score) expresses the risk of major bleeding with a scoring system consisting of 9&#xD;
      individual risk factors for bleeding; a patient is at high risk for bleeding, if 3 or more&#xD;
      factors are present. The stroke risk score (CHA2DS2-Vasc score) comprises of 9 individual&#xD;
      risk scores for stroke in patients suffering from atrial fibrillation. Both risk scores share&#xD;
      common risk factors, such as age, hypertension and previous stroke. It is therefore not&#xD;
      surprising that patients at highest risk for stroke are at the same time at highest risk for&#xD;
      major bleedings. The TAVI population forms such a high risk group with a high prevalence of&#xD;
      the above risk factors: average patients age in the PARTNER trial was 84 years, with 11%&#xD;
      showing severe renal impairment, about 75% had an indication for concomitant acetylsalicylic&#xD;
      acid use and all suffered per definition from heart failure. In Stortecky's study on TAVI&#xD;
      patients suffering AF, the average CHA2DS2-Vasc score was 4.5, with &gt;95% of patients having a&#xD;
      score &gt;3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) allows avoiding oral anticoagulation and provides at&#xD;
      the same time an at least equally good protection from strokes and peripheral embolism. It&#xD;
      may therefore be an attractive alternative to oral anticoagulation in the TAVI patient&#xD;
      population: the concept of LAAO is based on the fact that thrombus formation in atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation occurs in &gt;90% in the left atrial appendage (LAA). Mechanical occlusion of the&#xD;
      LAA reduces the stroke risk by eliminating the source of thrombus formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical studies proved this concept to be true: the PROTECT-AF study randomized &gt;700&#xD;
      patients to either LAA occlusion or medical therapy (VKA). At one year, non-inferiority of&#xD;
      LAAO was proven, with numerically less embolic events in the LAAO group. At a European&#xD;
      conference (EuroPCR conference) 2013, Holmes (principal investigator of the PROTECT-AF trial)&#xD;
      reported 4-year follow-up data with a significant 40% reduction of the composite of&#xD;
      stroke/peripheral embolism/cardiovascular death and a 34% reduction of all cause mortality in&#xD;
      the LAAO group as compared to oral anticoagulation. By reducing bleeding complications, it&#xD;
      can be anticipated that morbidity and mortality will continue to diverge between the two&#xD;
      groups. Comparable results from a large registry using Amplatzer devices (St. Jude Medical,&#xD;
      St. Paul, USA) for LAAO were reported: after an average follow-up of 32 months,&#xD;
      cardiovascular death, stroke, and peripheral embolism occurred in 7% of patients. In the&#xD;
      latter study, oral anticoagulation was instantly stopped after LAAO in all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the here proposed &quot;Randomized Comparison of Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion versus&#xD;
      Standard Medical Therapy of Atrial Fibrillation in Patients Undergoing Transfemoral&#xD;
      Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation&quot;, study the investigators test the hypothesis, that&#xD;
      LAAO is superior to standard medical therapy in the high-risk TAVI population. This&#xD;
      hypothesis has not been investigated by previous studies so far. The design is an&#xD;
      investigator-initiated, randomized, multicenter, non-blinded, all-comers study. It is&#xD;
      understood, that this is a pilot trial with the intention to prove safety, but which is&#xD;
      underpowered to show superiority over medical therapy.&#xD;
