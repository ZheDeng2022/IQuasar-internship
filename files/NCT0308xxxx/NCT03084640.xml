  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CMP-001-002 is a Phase 1b study of CMP-001 administered to participants with advanced&#xD;
      melanoma who are either receiving pembrolizumab, or who have previously received an&#xD;
      anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (anti-PD-1)/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) therapy&#xD;
      for advanced melanoma, and who have not responded (that is, immunotherapy resistant).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted in two parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 will consist of a Dose Escalation Phase and a Dose Expansion Phase&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose Escalation Phase will be conducted to assess and identify a recommended phase 2&#xD;
           dose (RP2D) of CMP-001 for subcutaneous (SC) administration&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Dose Expansion Phase is intended to further characterize the safety,&#xD;
           pharmacodynamics, and preliminary evidence of antitumor activity of the RP2D of CMP-001&#xD;
           administered SC in combination with pembrolizumab&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 will assess the safety and preliminary evidence of antitumor activity of CMP-001,&#xD;
      administered both SC and intratumoral (IT) when given in combination with pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will continue treatment with CMP-001 in combination with pembrolizumab as long&#xD;
      as they do not experience unacceptable toxicities and when continued treatment, is in the&#xD;
      participant's best interest according to the Investigator.&#xD;

             Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) or&#xD;

             Sponsor consultation. Participants who are currently receiving steroids at a dose of&#xD;
             &lt;=10 mg/day do not need to discontinue steroids prior to enrollment.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Severe uncontrolled cardiac disease within 6 months of screening, including but not&#xD;
