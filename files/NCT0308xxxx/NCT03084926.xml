  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is investigating a new experimental therapy, MP0274, a DARPin® drug candidate&#xD;
      targeting HER2. Preclinical studies suggest that MP0274 may provide additional benefit for&#xD;
      the treatment of HER2-positive cancers. This is the first study of MP0274 in humans and its&#xD;
      main purpose is to test its safety and tolerability in patients with HER2-positive cancer.&#xD;
      This study will also examine the blood levels of MP0274 at several escalating dose levels and&#xD;
      a recommended dose for further development will be determined. The recommended dose will be&#xD;
      tested in a second part of the study to confirm safety and to further assess the preliminary&#xD;
      biologic and anti-tumor activity&#xD;
