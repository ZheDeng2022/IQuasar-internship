      To assess the risk of lower extremity angular growth deformity following anterior cruciate&#xD;
      ligament (ACL) reconstructions in young patients who are not yet skeletally mature. The study&#xD;
      will compare two surgical techniques (physeal sparing vs transphyseal).&#xD;

      Background &amp; Significance: In the adult population, the vast majority of ACL reconstructions&#xD;
      are performed by drilling femoral and tibial bone tunnels. Because these patients have&#xD;
      achieved physeal closure by the time of surgery, there is no risk of angular growth deformity&#xD;
      when creating tibial and femoral tunnels. However, in the pediatric patient with open tibial&#xD;
      and femoral physes, there is concern that drilling across the physes using standard tunnels&#xD;
      may cause physeal injury with resultant angular deformity. Other surgical techniques have&#xD;
      been described that allow the graft to be placed without drilling tunnels across the tibial&#xD;
      and femoral physes but there is debate regarding whether or not these &quot;physeal sparing&quot;&#xD;
      techniques are as effective as the transphyseal tunnel positions. Drilling the tunnels in the&#xD;
      epiphysis to avoid the physis is a common &quot;physeal sparing&quot; technique. It is debated whether&#xD;
      this technique could also cause growth disturbances. Given the increasing number of pediatric&#xD;
      ACL injuries and that 95% of patients age 12 or less have open physes and that 94% of&#xD;
      patients age 14 or greater have closed physes, this topic is of significant interest. Similar&#xD;
      studies have been conducted but most have been either small and underpowered or have included&#xD;
      older adolescent patients. At Duke Sports Sciences Institute, we have a sizable population of&#xD;
      patients age 16 or less who have undergone ACL reconstruction with both transphyseal and all&#xD;
      epiphyseal techniques. This provides a unique opportunity to analyze and compare these two&#xD;
      groups with respect to clinical outcome and the incidence of growth disturbance or angular&#xD;
      deformity&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design &amp; Procedures: The investigator will conduct a review of medical records of seven&#xD;
      providers at a single site institution to determine the subject population. Specifically, the&#xD;
      investigator will look for patients who had an ACL reconstruction between the ages of 6-16&#xD;
      after January 1, 2005. The investigator will confirm in the medical record and in&#xD;
      pre-operative radiographs that the growth plates were open at the time of surgery. Only&#xD;
      subjects with open physeal will be enrolled in the study and they will be placed in 3&#xD;
      cohorts: Ages less than 12, 12-13, and 14 - 16. Subjects will be contacted by phone by a&#xD;
      member of the team and asked to return to Duke Sports Sciences Institute to participate in&#xD;
      the study. Upon arrival to clinic, subjects will be consented for the study and undergo a&#xD;
      full physical exam - specifically targeting the gait and range of motion, as well as the&#xD;
      Lachman, Anterior Drawer and Pivot Shift maneuvers to assess stability and functionality of&#xD;
      the graft. In addition, they will complete a questionnaire designed to elicit patient&#xD;
      satisfaction and level of activity/sports participation after the initial recovery period.&#xD;
      Bilateral hip to ankle radiographs will be taken of each subject. These radiographs will be&#xD;
      analyzed to assess for any angular deformity between the surgical and non-surgical leg. In&#xD;
      addition, baseline knee x-rays will be reviewed for determination of skeletal maturity at&#xD;
      time of injury/surgery. Data will be organized according to patients who underwent&#xD;
      transphyseal reconstruction and patients who underwent physeal sparing reconstruction and&#xD;
      separated into the corresponding age group. Comparisons will be made between the two surgical&#xD;
      techniques based on the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient satisfaction and return to function&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Graft stability&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Angular deformity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Skeletal maturity at the time of surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Interventions: Subjects will undergo physical examination (gait, inspections, range of&#xD;
      motion and instability testing) and completion of an outcome tool survey (IKDC&#xD;
      score/PediIKDC, VAS, Marx, and ACL-RSIsurvey). Subjects will undergo bilateral hip to ankle&#xD;
      radiographic imaging to assess for growth deformity. Subjects will also be asked to give&#xD;
      their permission to review their medical record and imaging pertinent to the knees and knee&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis &amp; Statistical Considerations: Patient's data will be collected in a database&#xD;
      program, indexed initially by medical record number. After case collection, case numbers will&#xD;
      be applied and medical record numbers stripped from the data. The code linking medical record&#xD;
      number to case number will be kept in a locked file with access limited to primary&#xD;
      investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contingency analysis using the Fisher exact test will be used to compare the distribution of&#xD;
      normal/nearly normal exam findings between the three cohorts&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation and range) will be reported for each of&#xD;
      these scores&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scores will be compared between the three cohorts using ANOVA with post-hoc analysis using&#xD;
      Tukey's correction for multiple comparisons&#xD;
&#xD;
      Privacy, Data Storage &amp; Confidentiality: The primary investigator will collect data in a&#xD;
      computerized database using a commercially available database program. During collection,&#xD;
      data will be indexed by the patient's medical record number. After data collection, a case&#xD;
      number will be assigned to the data and the medical record number (the only identifying data&#xD;
      collected) will be stripped from the database. The code linking medical record number to case&#xD;
      number will be kept in a locked file with access limited to primary investigator. When the&#xD;
      study is complete the code linking medical record numbers to case numbers will be destroyed.&#xD;
      During data collection and review, protected health information will be available only to the&#xD;
      primary investigator and will not be reused or disclosed to any other person or entity,&#xD;
      except as required by law, for authorized oversight of the research study.&#xD;
