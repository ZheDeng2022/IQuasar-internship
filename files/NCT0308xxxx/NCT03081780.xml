  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I open-label dose escalation study of a single infusion of FATE-NK100 and a&#xD;
      short course of subcutaneous interleukin-2 (IL-2) administered after lymphodepleting&#xD;
      chemotherapy (CY/FLU) in subjects with refractory or relapsed acute myelogenous leukemia&#xD;
      (AML). FATE-NK100 is a natural killer (NK) cell product that is enriched for NK cells with an&#xD;
      &quot;adaptive&quot;, or human cytomegalovirus (CMV)-induced, phenotype. The NK cell product is&#xD;
      comprised of peripheral blood (PB) leukocytes sourced from a related donor&#xD;
      (HLA-haploidentical or better but not fully HLA-matched) that is seropositive for&#xD;
      cytomegalovirus (CMV+), and enriched for adaptive NK cells by depletion of CD3+&#xD;
      (T-lymphocytes) and CD19+ (B-lymphocytes) cells followed by ex-vivo culture expansion.&#xD;
