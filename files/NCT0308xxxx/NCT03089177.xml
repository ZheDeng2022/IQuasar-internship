  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators previous studies show that community gardening is associated with reduction&#xD;
      of key health behaviors for cancer prevention in diverse populations. Community gardeners eat&#xD;
      more fruits and vegetables per day, are more physically active, and are more likely to avoid&#xD;
      age-associated increase in body mass index (BMI). The effect is partially explained by the&#xD;
      finding that gardeners are more socially involved, and feel more social support than&#xD;
      non-gardeners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a randomized controlled trial to determine whether community&#xD;
      gardening improves cancer-preventive behaviors among a multi-ethnic, low-income adult&#xD;
      population and elucidate the pathways that shape cancer-preventive behaviors. A randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial is needed to demonstrate that the observed behavioral differences are due to&#xD;
      the effect of gardening as an intervention rather than self-selection by gardeners.&#xD;

    <description>The investigators will recruit prospective adult gardeners who have not been gardening for the past two years and who are listed on Denver Urban Gardens (DUG) wait lists. Individuals randomized to the garden intervention will receive a standardized garden resource package, which includes the following:&#xD;
A garden plot in a Denver Urban Garden&#xD;
Seeds and plant starts&#xD;
Introductory gardening workshop&#xD;
Social events including garden-specific events and garden mentoring.&#xD;
The Wait List Control group will remain on the community gardening wait lists and will not receive these resources.&#xD;
Duration of the intervention is 1 year.</description>
