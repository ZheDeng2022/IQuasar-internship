      The intervention to be evaluated are operative hysteroscopy(group A) and ultrasound guided&#xD;
      aspiration(group C) and blinded vacuum aspiration(group B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all surgical procedures , surgical antibiotics prophylaxis, misoprostol to dilate cervix,&#xD;
      and anti adhesion barrier gel will be used. The evacuated retention products will be sent for&#xD;
      pathological examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A: Operative Hystroscopy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedure will be performed under general anaesthesia with the patient in lithotomy&#xD;
      position. the cervix is grasped with pozzi forceps and dilated up to hegar 9 to facilitate&#xD;
      insertion of the hysteroscopy. The uterine cavity will be distended with saline or glycine,&#xD;
      with a maximum irrigation pressure of 110mmHg. The retained products will be resected from&#xD;
      top to bottom with surgical resector without electric power. The use of forceps or curettes&#xD;
      to facilitate the removal of material is permitted. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B:blinded vacuum aspiration of gestational contents:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The women were allowed to empty their urinary bladder before induction of anesthesia, After&#xD;
      positioning the patient appropriately on the operating table, bimanual pelvic examination was&#xD;
      performed under anesthesia to assess the axis and the size of the uterus. A Sim's speculum&#xD;
      was inserted into the vagina; the cervix was visualized and grasped using the Vulsellum&#xD;
      forceps. The cervical canal was dilated gradually with Hegar dilators up to the size&#xD;
      corresponding to the weeks of gestation. The uterine cavity was evacuated using a plastic&#xD;
      cannula attached to an electric suction apparatus. Negative pressure of 75 mmHg was used. The&#xD;
      aspirate was examined to confirm the presence of products of conception. The completeness of&#xD;
      the evacuation was checked by gentle sharp curettage and final suctioning at the end of&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;

      The intervention to be evaluated are operative hysteroscopy(group A) and ultrasound guided&#xD;
      aspiration(group C) and blinded vacuum aspiration(group B).these procedures are routinely&#xD;
      performed in the obstetrics and gynecology department for various indications. For all&#xD;
      surgical procedures , surgical antibiotics prophylaxis, misoprostol to dilate cervix, and&#xD;
      anti adhesion barrier gel will be used. The evacuated retention products will be sent for&#xD;
      pathological examination. RH negative women will receive prophylaxis to prevent RH&#xD;
      alloimmunization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A: Operative Hystroscopy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedure will be performed by a gynecological surgeon, under general anaesthesia with&#xD;
      the patient in lithotomy position. Antibiotic prophylaxis may be administered, the cervix is&#xD;
      grasped with pozzi forceps and dilated up to hegar 9 to facilitate insertion of the&#xD;
      hysteroscopy. The uterine cavity will be distended with saline or glycine, depending on the&#xD;
      polarity of the resection system.with a maximum irrigation pressure of 110mmHg. The retained&#xD;
      products will be resected from top to bottom with surgical resector without electric power.&#xD;
      The use of forceps or curettes to facilitate the removal of material is permitted. If active&#xD;
      bleeding occurs , elective coagulation by hystroscope is done to stop intrauterine bleeding.&#xD;
      The deficit of distending media should be calculated at the end of procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B:blinded vacuum aspiration of gestational contents:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The women were allowed to empty their urinary bladder before induction of anesthesia, but&#xD;
      catheterization was not performed. After positioning the patient appropriately on the&#xD;
      operating table, bimanual pelvic examination was performed under anesthesia to assess the&#xD;
      axis and the size of the uterus. A Sim's speculum was inserted into the vagina; the cervix&#xD;
      was visualized and grasped using the Vulsellum forceps. The cervical canal was dilated&#xD;
      gradually with Hegar dilators up to the size corresponding to the weeks of gestation. The&#xD;
      uterine cavity was evacuated using a plastic cannula attached to an electric suction&#xD;
      apparatus. Negative pressure of 75 mmHg was used. The aspirate was examined to confirm the&#xD;
      presence of products of conception. The completeness of the evacuation was checked by gentle&#xD;
      sharp curettage and final suctioning at the end of procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group C: Ultrasound guided aspiration curettage :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The transducer was held on the abdomen to obtain a longitudinal image of the uterus and&#xD;
      cervix and provide the surgeon with a visual reference of the gestational sac, cervical canal&#xD;
      and any instruments passed into the uterus.The progress of the operation was continuously&#xD;
      monitored as the uterine contents were evacuated under visual control. It was possible to&#xD;
      keep the dilators and the suction cannula under constant view by slightly tilting the&#xD;
      transducer as required. Advancement of any instrument was allowed only under direct&#xD;
      ultrasound control.The completeness of the evacuation was confirmed by the scan in these&#xD;
      cases.&#xD;
