  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative conventional radiation at 60 Gy/30f is currently still considered the standard&#xD;
      radiotherapy mode for high-grade gliomas; however, the efficacy is still unsatisfactory.&#xD;
      Studies in recent years have shown that hypofractionated simultaneous integrated&#xD;
      boost-intensity modulated radiation therapy (SIB-IMRT) has certain survival benefits over&#xD;
      other fractionation methods; but, the best hypofractionation mode and its efficacy have not&#xD;
      been confirmed. The purpose of this study is to investigate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)&#xD;
      of hypofractionated SIB-IMRT with stepwise escalating of doses combined with temozolomide&#xD;
      (TMZ) for the treatment of malignant gliomas.&#xD;

      Background: Postoperative conventional radiation at 60 Gy/30f is currently still considered&#xD;
      the standard radiotherapy mode for high-grade gliomas; however, the efficacy is still&#xD;
      unsatisfactory. Studies in recent years have shown that hypofractionated simultaneous&#xD;
      integrated boost-intensity modulated radiation therapy (SIB-IMRT) has certain survival&#xD;
      benefits over other fractionation methods; but, the best hypofractionation mode and its&#xD;
      efficacy have not been confirmed. The purpose of this study is to investigate the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD) of hypofractionated SIB-IMRT with stepwise escalating of doses combined&#xD;
      with temozolomide (TMZ) for the treatment of malignant gliomas. Methods: Malignant gliomas&#xD;
      patients receive concurrent postoperative radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The simultaneous&#xD;
      integrated boost-intensity modulated technology is adopted to increase both the dose in the&#xD;
      surgical cavity and residual tumor (PTV1). The dose at each fraction is gradually increased&#xD;
      from 2.8 Gy/f (total of 20 times) with an escalating dose interval of 0.4 Gy. The planning&#xD;
      target volume (PTV2) including the 2cm region around surgical cavity and residual tumor&#xD;
      remain unchanged, with 2.5 Gy each time and a total of 50 Gy/20f. The subsequent group of&#xD;
      patients is advanced to the next dose level until dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is present.&#xD;
      The dose, one level lower than the DLT, is the MTD. The highest target single dose is 4 Gy/f.&#xD;
      TMZ is administered orally every day at 75 mg/m2 during radiotherapy and at 150-200 mg/m2 for&#xD;
      12 cycles following completion of chemoradiotherapy.&#xD;
