  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is Phase 1b/2 study to investigate the safety and effectiveness of the investigational&#xD;
      drug, cirmtuzumab, when given in combination with ibrutinib in patients with B-cell lymphoid&#xD;
      malignancies. Cirmtuzumab is a monoclonal antibody that attaches to a protein (called ROR 1)&#xD;
      that is found on hematologic tumor cells. ROR1 has been shown to play a role in cell&#xD;
      signaling that cause leukemia and lymphoma cells to grow and survive. ROR1 is rarely found on&#xD;
      healthy cells.&#xD;

      This is a Phase 1b/2 study to investigate the safety and effectiveness of the investigational&#xD;
      drug, cirmtuzumab, when given in combination with ibrutinib in patients with B-cell lymphoid&#xD;
      malignancies. The Phase 1b will be conducted in two parts (Part 1 and Part 2). Part 1 is a&#xD;
      dose-finding evaluation of the sequential administration of cirmtuzumab monotherapy followed&#xD;
      by cirmtuzumab and ibrutinib combination therapy in chronic lymphocytic leukemia /small&#xD;
      lymphocytic leukemia (CLL/SLL) or previously treated mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) subjects are&#xD;
      BTKI naiive or have received a prior Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor therapy, unless&#xD;
      they demonstrated primary or acquired resistance to BTKi. Up to 48 subjects will be enrolled&#xD;
      in Part 1 to determine the recommended dosing regimen (RDR). In Part 2, up to 50 subjects&#xD;
      will be enrolled to further evaluate the safety and pharmacology of the cirmtuzumab and&#xD;
      ibrutinib combination given at the RDR determined in Part 1 of the study. In the Phase 2&#xD;
      (Part 3) portion of the study, approximately 31 subjects with CLL/SLL who may have received&#xD;
      minimal prior BTK inhibitor therapy will be randomized to either Arm 1 (cirmtuzumab and&#xD;
      ibrutinib) at the RDR or Arm 2 (ibrutinib alone) to evaluate the clinical activity and safety&#xD;
      of the two arms. Parts 4A, B and C, will enroll up to 6 MCL patients into each exploratory&#xD;
      treatment arm and Part D will enroll up to 16 MCL patients. In Part 4, cirmtuzumab and&#xD;
      ibrutinib will be evaluated in patients with MCL that initially responded, were sensitive to&#xD;
      BTKi therapy (defined as having measurable tumor regression) but then had progressive disease&#xD;
      (Cheson 2014) while receiving continuous therapy with BTKi containing regimens for at least 6&#xD;
      months with ibrutinib (4A), acalabrutinib (4B), or zanubrutinib (4C). Part 4D will evaluate&#xD;
      the ability of cirmtuzumab and ibrutinib to improve clinical responses in MCL patients who&#xD;
      are currently receiving ibrutinib monotherapy or an ibrutinib-containing regimen and have&#xD;
      received at least 6 months of ongoing treatment but have only achieved SD or PR. Patients&#xD;
      will be enrolled to receive cirmtuzumab and ibrutinib to investigate if the addition of&#xD;
      cirmtuzumab could result in improving responses from stable disease (SD) to partial response&#xD;
      (PR) or complete response (CR) or from PR to CR.&#xD;

             bilateral vasectomy with documented aspermia or a bilateral orchiectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             19) In the judgment of the investigator, participation in the protocol offers an&#xD;
             acceptable benefit-to-risk ratio when considering current disease status, medical&#xD;
             condition, and the potential benefits and risks of alternative treatments for the&#xD;
             subject's cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
             20)Willingness and ability of the subject to comply with scheduled visits, drug&#xD;

             study restrictions.&#xD;
&#xD;
             21)Evidence of a personally signed informed consent indicating that the subject is&#xD;
             aware of the neoplastic nature of the disease and has been informed of the procedures&#xD;
             to be followed, the experimental nature of the therapy, alternatives, potential risks&#xD;
             and discomforts, potential benefits, and other pertinent aspects of study&#xD;
             participation.&#xD;

&#xD;
               3. Presence of another cancer with disease manifestations or therapy that could&#xD;
                  adversely affect subject safety or longevity, create the potential for drug-drug&#xD;

                  enzyme insufficiency, malabsorption syndrome, symptomatic inflammatory bowel&#xD;
                  disease, chronic diarrheal illness, bowel obstruction) that might interfere with&#xD;
                  drug absorption or with interpretation of gastrointestinal AEs.&#xD;
&#xD;
               7. Contraindication for ibrutinib use because of bleeding diathesis.&#xD;
