  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Standard treatment options for patients who are diagnosed with BVFP include tracheostomy,&#xD;
      cordotomy, arytenoidectomy, and suture tie-back. These standard treatment options may result&#xD;
      in permanent damage to the vocal fold, therefore affecting the patient's ability to speak and&#xD;
      compromising airway protection during swallowing. Additionally, these routine procedures&#xD;
      cannot provide sufficient airway to permit significant aerobic activity. The goal in&#xD;
      conducting this early feasibility study is to investigate the use of this device as a&#xD;
      laryngeal pacemaker to treat BVFP.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) carries motor fibers that innervate both the abductor&#xD;
      (PCA, opener) muscle and adductor (closer) muscles of the vocal folds. Damage to the nerve&#xD;
      compromises both of these functions and arrests the vocal folds in a near-closed position. In&#xD;
      case of BVFP, voice tends to be functional but airway embarrassment is often severe enough to&#xD;
      warrant tracheostomy to relieve inspiratory stridor and dyspnea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If spontaneous recovery from nerve injury does not occur within one year, it is likely the&#xD;
      patient will be chronically paralyzed. In such instances, long-term tracheostomy could be&#xD;
      considered. Unfortunately, permanent tracheostomy is known to have the complications of&#xD;
      tracheal stenosis, chronic infection, and psycho-social impairment. For this reason,&#xD;
      laryngeal surgery is offered to enlarge the airway and restore breathing through the mouth.&#xD;
      These procedures, such as arytenoidectomy and cordotomy, where a portion of the larynx is&#xD;
      surgically resected to enlarge the airway, also have inherent complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although they represent the standard of care, they adversely affect voice and may compromise&#xD;
      airway protection during swallowing. Further, they cannot provide sufficient airway to permit&#xD;
      significant aerobic activity. The limitations associated with these current therapies have&#xD;
      prompted investigation into a more physiologic, dynamic approach to rehabilitation:&#xD;
      reanimation of the paralyzed PCA muscle by functional electrical stimulation (FES).&#xD;
      Stimulation would be applied to the PCA muscle during the inspiratory phase of respiration to&#xD;
      open the vocal folds. During noninspiratory phases, stimulation would cease and the vocal&#xD;
      folds would passively relax to the midline to allow for normal voice production and airway&#xD;
      protection in swallowing. Based on the research the investigators have conducted, the&#xD;
      investigators expect patients would benefit from bilateral pacing through implantation of the&#xD;
      neurostimulator by restoring normal ventilation, without negatively affecting the patient's&#xD;
      voice or swallowing ability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are collecting data in this study to show that this procedure is an&#xD;
      effective means of a surgical approach for implantation of device with insertion and&#xD;
      anchoring of the electrode leads. Incidence of complications both intraoperatively and&#xD;
      postoperatively will also be collected and assessed. Any complications will be addressed&#xD;
      according to current standard practice under the supervision of the operating surgeon. The&#xD;
      device should produce an airway that will allow patients to breathe without a tracheostomy&#xD;
      tube in place. Patients will be monitored for adverse events and managed accordingly.&#xD;
