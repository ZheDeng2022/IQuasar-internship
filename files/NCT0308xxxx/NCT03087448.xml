      This is a phase I/II study of ceritinib and trametinib in Stage IIIB or IV anaplastic&#xD;
      lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearranged non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The Phase I portion will&#xD;
      investigate the safety and tolerability of the combination of ceritinib and trametinib in ALK&#xD;
      or ROS-1 rearranged NSCLC. The Phase II portion will investigate the clinical efficiency of&#xD;
      the combination of ceritinib and trametinib in 3 single arm cohorts: ALKi (ALK inhibitor)&#xD;
      naïve patients; post-crizotinib progressed disease (PD) patients; and PD second line ALK&#xD;
      tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) patients.&#xD;

      This is a phase I/II study of ceritinib and trametinib in Stage IIIB or IV ALK rearranged&#xD;
      NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The phase I portion is a standard 3+3 dose escalation study starting at dose level 1 and will&#xD;
      be open to any patient with ALK-rearranged, or ROS-1 rearranged NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The phase II portion will consist of 3 single arm cohorts in ALK-rearranged NSCLC:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort A (ALKi Naïve): 20 evaluable patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort B (Post-crizotinib PD): 21 evaluable patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort C (PD second line ALK TKI (e.g., alectinib, ceritinib, PF-06463922 or - AP21163):&#xD;
           10 evaluable patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim will be to enroll up to 69 patients. Patients may continue treatment for up to 24&#xD;
      months from the time of study entry, and will receive 12 months of follow-up following&#xD;
      completion of the drugs.&#xD;

&#xD;
             In case of use of oral contraception, women should have been stable on the same pill&#xD;
             for a minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have&#xD;
             had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical&#xD;
             profile. (e.g., age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical&#xD;
             bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six&#xD;
             weeks prior to screening. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the&#xD;
             reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level&#xD;
             assessment is she considered not of child bearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Sexually active males unless they use a condom during intercourse while taking drug&#xD;
             and for 3 months after the last dose of study treatment. Male patients for 3 months&#xD;
             should not father a child in this period. A condom is required to be used also by&#xD;
             vasectomized men in order to prevent delivery of the drug via seminal fluid.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Patient has a history of pancreatitis or history of increased amylase or lipase that&#xD;
             was due to pancreatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Patient has other severe, acute, or chronic medical conditions including uncontrolled&#xD;
             diabetes mellitus or psychiatric conditions or laboratory abnormalities that, in the&#xD;
             opinion of the investigator, may increase the risk associated with study participation&#xD;
             or may interfere with the interpretation of study results.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Patient has had major surgery (e.g., intra-thoracic, intra-abdominal or intra-pelvic)&#xD;
             within 4 weeks prior to starting study treatment or has not recovered from side&#xD;
             effects of such procedure. Video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) and mediastinoscopy&#xD;
             will not be counted as major surgery and patients can receive study treatment ≥ 1 week&#xD;
             after these procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. History of another malignancy. Exception: Subjects who have been disease-free for 3&#xD;
             years, or subjects with a history of completely resected non-melanoma skin cancer&#xD;
             and/or subjects with indolent (early stage breast cancer or prostate cancer) second&#xD;
             malignancies are eligible after discussion with the study principle investigator (PI).&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. History of retinal vein occlusion (RVO)&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Symptomatic brain metastases or leptomeningeal (LM) disease requiring corticosteroids&#xD;
             for symptom management. Asymptomatic brain metastases or LM will be allowed on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Known Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), or Hepatitis C&#xD;
             Virus (HCV) infection (subjects with laboratory evidence of cleared HBV and HCV&#xD;
             infection will be permitted).&#xD;
