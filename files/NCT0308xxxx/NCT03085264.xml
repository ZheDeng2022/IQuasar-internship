  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study focuses on pairing community health workers (CHWs) with patients that are high&#xD;
      risk for readmission prior to hospital discharge in order to assess differences in hospital&#xD;
      readmission rates, ED visits, patient satisfaction and provider satisfaction as compared to&#xD;
      patients without community health worker pairings at discharge.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized controlled trial of 1200 adult patients admitted to internal&#xD;
      medicine units that will examine the effectiveness of pairing patients that are high risk for&#xD;
      readmission with community health workers at the time of hospital discharge on hospital&#xD;
      readmission rates, emergency room visits, adherence to post-discharge medical appontments,&#xD;
      and satisfaction with care. During this study, community health workers will partner with&#xD;
      patients for 30 days after discharge from the hospital to address barriers to care via phone&#xD;
      contacts, home visits, and accompanying patients to medical appointments/other non-clinical&#xD;
      supportive care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 1) Determine if patients randomly assigned to the intervention group have lower rates of&#xD;
      hospital readmission than the control group at the end of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1.1 Study participants in the intervention group will have lower rates of&#xD;
      post-discharge thirty day readmission than the study participants in the control group at the&#xD;
      end of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 2) Determine if patients randomly assigned to the intervention group will have less&#xD;
      emergency room visits than the control group at the end of the intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2.1 Study participants in the intervention group will have less emergency room&#xD;
      visits than the study participants in the control group at the end of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 3) Determine if patients randomly assigned to the intervention group have more adherence&#xD;
      to post-discharge appointments that study group participants in the control group at the end&#xD;
      of the intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: 3.1 Study participants in the intervention group will have higher rates of&#xD;
      attendance at post-discharge medical appointments than the study participants in the control&#xD;
      group at the end of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 4) Determine if patients randomly assigned to the intervention group have higher levels&#xD;
      of patient psychosocial support and satisfaction with post-discharge care than the control&#xD;
      group&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 4.1: Study participants in the intervention group will have higher levels of&#xD;
      patient psychosocial support and satisfaction with post-discharge care than the study&#xD;
      participants in the control group at the end of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 5) Determine if Primary Care Physicians of patients randomly assigned to the intervention&#xD;
      group have higher levels of satisfaction with post-discharge care than Primary Care Providers&#xD;
      of patients in the control group&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 5.1: Primary Care Physicians of patients randomly assigned to the intervention&#xD;
      group have higher levels of satisfaction with post-discharge care than Primary Care Providers&#xD;
      of patients in the control group&#xD;
&#xD;
      After reviewing the fact sheet and consenting to enrollment by signing the informed consent&#xD;
      form, patients will randomized to the intervention or control groups of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PROCEDURES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Arm Group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomized to the intervention group will be paired with community health workers&#xD;
      prior to discharge from the hospital and patient- centered program goals will be established.&#xD;
      A patient questionnaire (10-15 minutes) will be administered to intervention study&#xD;
      participants by a study coordinator prior to discharge. A chart review will be performed for&#xD;
      all intervention group participants by study coordinators prior to patient discharge.&#xD;
      Patient-CHW pairings will continue for thirty days post-discharge and will include phone&#xD;
      contacts, home visits, accompanying patients to medical appointments and other non-clinical&#xD;
      supportive care. Both intervention group participants and primary care providers (PCPs) of&#xD;
      intervention study participants will complete questionnaires 30-60 days after hospital&#xD;
      discharge to assess certain patient ( 10 minute questionnaire; via phone) and primary care&#xD;
      provider ( 5 minute questionnaire via email) perceptions (Please see Aim 4 and Aim 5). CHWs&#xD;
      will document patient encounters in a REDCap database and complete patient care notes in&#xD;
      EPIC. All intervention study participants readmitted within thirty days of prior discharge&#xD;
      will be administered a readmission questionnaire by study coordinators. A chart review for&#xD;
      readmitted study participants will also be performed by study staff. A REDCap database will&#xD;
      be used to store all questionnaire and chart review data. Readmission rates, ED visits, PCP&#xD;
      appointment compliance, patient/ PCP will be tracked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Arm Group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those randomized to the control group will receive usual care without a community heath&#xD;
      worker pairing. A patient questionnaire (10-15 minutes) will be administered to intervention&#xD;
      study participants by a study coordinator prior to discharge. A chart review will be&#xD;
      performed for all control group participants by study coordinators prior to patient&#xD;
      discharge. Both control group participants and primary care providers (PCPs) of intervention&#xD;
      study participants will complete questionnaires 30-60 days after hospital discharge to assess&#xD;
      certain patient ( 10 minute questionnaire; via phone) and primary care provider ( 5 minute&#xD;
      questionnaire via email) perceptions (Please see Aim 4 and Aim 5). A REDCap database will be&#xD;
      used to store all questionnaire and chart review data. Readmission rates, ED visits, PCP&#xD;
      appointment compliance, patient/ PCP perceptions will be tracked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three groups of research subjects will be assessed: the intervention study group, the control&#xD;
      study group, and the PCPs of the patients enrolled in the study.&#xD;
