      This is a prospective randomized controlled study to test the hypothesis that neuromuscular&#xD;
      electrical stimulation (NMES) and remote pulmonary rehabilitation at home offered via a smart&#xD;
      technology, called Smart TeleHealth, results in a reduction of systemic inflammation, via&#xD;
      reduction of skeletal muscle tissue inflammation, and thereby improves functional capacity,&#xD;
      and thus, reduces the rate of readmissions following hospitalization for acute exacerbations&#xD;
      of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). This study will enroll up to 40 participants&#xD;
      at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), about 30 will get Smart Telehealth and&#xD;
      NMES, and 10 will get usual care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall hypothesis of our proposal is that neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES)&#xD;
      and remote pulmonary rehabilitation at home offered via smart technology results in a&#xD;
      reduction of systemic inflammation, via reduction of skeletal muscle tissue inflammation, and&#xD;
      thereby improves functional capacity, and thus, reduces the rate of readmissions following&#xD;
      hospitalization for acute exacerbations of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD.) We&#xD;
      propose the following specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To determine if an NMES and remote tele pulmonary rehabilitation intervention reduces&#xD;
      30-day all cause readmissions in patients hospitalized for acute exacerbation of COPD.&#xD;
      Skeletal muscle dysfunction is associated with the number of hospital admissions, duration of&#xD;
      hospital stay and total number of exacerbations. We and others have shown that applying NMES&#xD;
      results in significant improvements in quadriceps muscle strength. It is plausible that&#xD;
      targeting skeletal muscle dysfunction will result in improved respiratory outcomes. Based on&#xD;
      our preliminary results comparing our exercise intervention with historic data, we&#xD;
      hypothesize that a combination of early in-hospital and home NMES and home pulmonary&#xD;
      rehabilitation using smart technology will prevent hospital readmissions following an acute&#xD;
      exacerbation of COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To evaluate the effects of an NMES and remote tele pulmonary rehabilitation&#xD;
      intervention on muscle strength, dyspnea and respiratory quality of life in COPD post&#xD;
      hospital discharge. Skeletal muscle dysfunction contributes to the morbidity associated with&#xD;
      acute exacerbations, results in a longer duration of hospital stay and a shorter time to&#xD;
      readmission, and is associated with more frequent exacerbations. We hypothesize that by&#xD;
      preventing deconditioning, improving muscle bioenergetics and positively affecting muscle&#xD;
      strength, NMES and home pulmonary rehabilitation will improve respiratory quality of life,&#xD;
      dyspnea and functional capacity. We will compare outcome measures for respiratory morbidity&#xD;
      at baseline with those at 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To evaluate the effects of NMES and remote tele pulmonary rehabilitation intervention&#xD;
      on systemic and muscle inflammation. Acute exacerbations of COPD are associated with&#xD;
      sustained systemic inflammation and the mechanism for this may be perpetuation of&#xD;
      inflammation by a skeletal muscle reservoir. We have previously shown that older patients&#xD;
      such as those with COPD are more susceptible to muscle inflammation. Based on our preliminary&#xD;
      results showing significant benefits, we hypothesize that the reduced readmission rates are a&#xD;
      direct effect of lowering muscle inflammation. We hypothesize that inflammation arising from&#xD;
      the lungs is perpetuated by pro-inflammatory signaling in the skeletal muscles that sustains&#xD;
      systemic inflammation, and this can be reduced by a combination of early NMES and exercise&#xD;
      therapy at home by reducing skeletal muscle production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. We will&#xD;
      perform quadriceps muscle biopsy at baseline and at 4 weeks to demonstrate reduction in&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory signaling in skeletal muscles at 4 weeks in the intervention arm and&#xD;
      anticipate that this reduction will be associated with reduction in systemic inflammation.&#xD;

    <description>Bipolar self-adhesive neuromuscular stimulation electrodes will be placed over the quadriceps femoris muscle group. Stimulation pulses (30 Hz trains of 300 μsec biphasic pulses) will be delivered using the neuromuscular electrical stimulator. A 5 sec on/25 sec off work/rest ratio will be used initially, progressing to 10 sec on/30 sec off. The patient will be fully supported while knee extensions are performed as the participant sits in a chair. Current from the stimulator will be manually increased and determined by patient tolerance. The goal for each patient will be to reach the highest tolerable amplitude (up to 100mA). Training will be performed on each quadriceps femoris muscle, 30 minutes/day, for 2 weeks including hospital stay till return to the COPD Clinic. This will be followed by pulmonary rehabilitation exercises delivered at home via a smart phone for an additional 10 weeks. Rehabilitation will involve aerobics, strength training as well as breathing exercises.</description>
