    <textblock>
      Cardioplegic arrest is an essential part of cardiac surgery which aims to allow myocardial&#xD;
      preservation and minimise myocardial swelling ,while providing a motionless and bloodless&#xD;
      field ,.Blood cardioplegia has proven its efficacy for several decades and surgeons are still&#xD;
      preferring to use it for myocardial protection of paediatric cardiac surgery ,although it is&#xD;
      thought to be more time consuming since it is given with interrupted doses, . Even when&#xD;
      advancement has came along the field of myocardial protection and cardioplegia solutions with&#xD;
      the introduction of Bretschneider Histidine-Tryptophan-Ketoglutarate solution ,custodiol ,in&#xD;
      1970 ,which is given as a single dose and believed to be convenient, simple to deliver , and&#xD;
      less time consuming . Many Surgeons haven't change their practice possibly due to paucity of&#xD;
      studies comparing cardioplegia solutions in paediatric cardiac surgery and conflicting&#xD;
      reports regarding the superiority of different cardioplegia solution.The investigators aim to&#xD;
      provide evidence that will help paediatric cardiac surgeons to choose the optimal solution&#xD;
      for their practice .&#xD;

      Hypothesis :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Custodial is not inferior to blood cardioplegia in myocardial protection in paediatric&#xD;
      cardiac surgery ..&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized controlled trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All demographic data ,diagnosis ,procedure(type.CPB time ,crossclamp time) , surgeon and&#xD;
      hospital course details .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Computer generated randomisation into two groups based on cardioplegia solution .&#xD;
&#xD;
      if randomised to blood patient will receive blood cardioplegia, delivered by microplegia&#xD;
      delivery system by adding potassium to the blood (K= 35 ml eq/L) . The initial dose will be&#xD;
      35ml/ kg, and subsequent doses 20-15 ml/kg given every 20 minutes at a Temperature of 10 - 15&#xD;
      °C, while maintaining a perfusion pressure of 100-125 mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      if randomised to custodial patient will receive single dose of HTK custodiol cardioplegia. at&#xD;
      temperature of 4-8°C and will be perfused for 6-8 minutes. Dose will start from 400 up to&#xD;
      1000 ml according to the child's body weight. Perfusion pressure will be kept at 70 - 80 mmHg&#xD;
      until the heart is arrested..&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgeons will know the type of cardioplegia in the OR while other assessor will be blinded .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculated with an online calculator based on α error of 0.05 and β error of 0.2&#xD;
      to detect an absolute risk difference of 15% in composite end point between the two groups&#xD;
      yielded 137 in each arm ,The results will be presented as mean (SD), median (interquartile&#xD;
      range), or proportion . Using relative risk and log rank for statistical analysis .A P value&#xD;
      of less than 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses will be&#xD;
      carried out using the SPSS .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety monitoring and interim results :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both cardioplegia solutions are already in use and FDA approved there is no safety concerns&#xD;
      at the time being . However , an interim analysis will be carried on every 6 months and the&#xD;
      principal investigator will decide weather to stop or carry on if any major discrepancies in&#xD;
      outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      literature review : After an extensive literature review the investigators found only one&#xD;
      randomised trial by elmorsy et al , which concluded that A single dose of an HTK cardioplegic&#xD;
      solution provides better myocardial and cerebral protection than repeated doses of oxygenated&#xD;
      blood cardioplegia during pediatric congenital cardiac surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand there was another retrospective report by bojan et al, found that The use&#xD;
      of Custodiol cardioplegia in neonates undergoing ASO was associated with a larger troponin&#xD;
      release when compared with warm blood cardioplegia,p &lt;0.001 suggesting poor myocardial&#xD;
      protection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      koruon et al, done a tissue level comparison between htk and conventional crystalloid&#xD;
      cardioplegia and their statistical analysis revealed no significant difference between the&#xD;
      two groups regarding the clinical variables, apoptotic indices and proliferation indices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liu j et al ,did a retrospective study comparing custodiol to St. Thomas crystalloid&#xD;
      cardioplegia which concluded That HTK group had shorter cross-clamping time and more frequent&#xD;
      spontaneous defibrillation than St. Thomas group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also an animal study by Chen Y et al, on piglets that were randomised to either a single dose&#xD;
      of HTK or multidose cold blood cardioplegia .. No significant differences were noted in the&#xD;
      myocardial lactate content, ATP content, and histopathological score between both groups .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally a retrospective report by E Qulisy et al concluded that Custodiol cardioplegia is&#xD;
      associated with less myocardial protection and higher adverse outcomes compared to blood&#xD;
      cardioplegia in pediatric age group undergoing cardiac surgery.&#xD;
