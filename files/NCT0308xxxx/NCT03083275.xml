  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The age-related loss in skeletal muscle mass is associated with substantial social and&#xD;
      economic costs as evidenced by impairments in strength, limitations in function, and&#xD;
      ultimately, physical disability and institutionalization (1-3). Improved knowledge of the&#xD;
      physiologic mechanisms that mediate impairments in physical functioning is crucial for&#xD;
      developing effective therapeutic interventions for preserving mobility and independence among&#xD;
      physically frail adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, pharmacodynamic markers that can be used in a clinical trial in mobility-limited&#xD;
      older adults are limited. Lean body mass measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA)&#xD;
      is frequently used in early phase clinical development of investigational anabolic drugs.&#xD;
      Although increase in muscle mass is considered to contribute to increased muscle strength,&#xD;
      this alone does not completely explain changes in physical performance. Thus, more direct&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic evidence associated with physical functioning is desired in early phase&#xD;
      clinical development decision making. Assessments of muscle power and fatigue can address&#xD;
      this need. The use of such assessments may provide more meaningful information as to the&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics effects of investigational drugs on muscle parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will serve as a validation study, aiming to 1) examine the effect a 12-week&#xD;
      resistance program may have on muscle power and fatigue; 2) examine the effect of a 12-week&#xD;
      resistance exercise program on conventional measures of muscle function; 3) determine the&#xD;
      relationship between muscle power/fatigue and conventional measures of physical function.&#xD;
      Data from this study will serve as rationale for potentially including these measures as&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics markers in studies of novel therapies for skeletal muscle loss and/or&#xD;
      weakness.&#xD;

      The age-related loss in skeletal muscle mass is associated with substantial social and&#xD;

      pharmacodynamic evidence associated with physical functioning is desired in early phase&#xD;
      clinical development decision making. Assessments of muscle power and fatigue can address&#xD;
      this need. For example, Bean et al reported that improvements in leg power, independent of&#xD;
      strength, appear to make an important contribution to clinically meaningful improvements in&#xD;
      SPPB (Short Physical Performance Battery) and gait speed (4). Avin and Frey Law performed a&#xD;
      systematic meta-analysis of studies reporting fatigue tasks (voluntary activation) performed&#xD;
      at a relative-intensity in both young (18-45 years of age) and old (&gt;54 years of age) healthy&#xD;
      adults to conclude older adults were able to sustain relative-intensity tasks significantly&#xD;
      longer or with less force decay than younger adults although this age-related difference was&#xD;
      present only for sustained and intermittent isometric contractions and this age-related&#xD;
      advantage was lost for dynamic tasks (5). The use of such assessments may provide more&#xD;
      meaningful information as to the pharmacodynamics effects of investigational drugs on muscle&#xD;
      parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will serve as a validation study, aiming to 1) examine the effect a 12-week&#xD;
