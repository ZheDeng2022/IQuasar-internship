      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People get malaria from bites from infected mosquitos. Researchers are studying a vaccine&#xD;
      strategy. They will give people malaria parasites by injecting them with live infectious&#xD;
      malaria parasites with antimalarial medications and then see if this strategy prevents&#xD;
      malaria infection while off antimalarial medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if combining a high dose of live, infectious malaria parasites (known as Sanaria PfSPZ&#xD;
      Challenge) and two FDA approved drugs that kill malaria parasites (pyrimethamine [PYR] OR&#xD;
      chloroquine [CQ]) is safe and can provide people protection against malaria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy adults ages 18-50 who:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  are not pregnant or breastfeeding or planning on becoming pregnant while in the study&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  have reliable early morning access to the NIH Clinical Center&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  are able to come to the outpatient clinic frequently, sometimes daily&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  have not been diagnosed with malaria within the past 10 years&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with medical history and physical exam. They will have&#xD;
           heart, blood, and urine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have blood drawn for tests at most visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will keep track of their temperature and symptoms during some sections of&#xD;
           the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will join one part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 is one month:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will get the parasites by an injection into a vein on day 1 and receive&#xD;
           antimalarial medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They will have daily visits on days 7-14&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They will take another antimalarial at visits on days 15-17.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The final visit will be on day 29.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 is seven months:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For the first 3 months, participants will get the parasite injection into a vein for 3&#xD;
           injections in total. Each injection will occur once per month while taking an&#xD;
           antimalarial drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They will have daily visits on days 7-14 after the first injection, and on days 7-11&#xD;
           after the second and third injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They will have a final (fourth) injection around month 6 without any antimalarial&#xD;
           medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After this fourth injection, participants may have up to 21 daily visits from day 7&#xD;
           after injection until end of study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 3 is one month:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will get the parasites by injection into a vein on day 1 without&#xD;
           antimalarial medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They will have visits almost every day starting day 7 from injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They will take an antimalarial medication when they are diagnosed with malaria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They will return for final end of study visit on days 27-29.&#xD;

      Human studies have shown that immunization by the bite Plasmodium falciparum (Pf)&#xD;
      sporozoite(SPZ)-infected mosquitoes under drug coverage with chloroquine, an approach called&#xD;
      chemoprophylaxis with sporozoites (CPS) or infection treatment vaccination (ITV), can provide&#xD;
      high level, long term protection against homologous controlled human malaria infection&#xD;
      (CHMI). The Sanaria PfSPZ chemoprophylaxis vaccination (PfSPZ CVac) approach duplicates this&#xD;
      with an injectable SPZ regimen. In both approaches, whether mosquitoes or syringes are used&#xD;
      for SPZ administration, when chloroquine is used as the chemoprophylactic agent, transient,&#xD;
      limited, asexual erythrocytic stage is seen in the majority of participants. Thus the&#xD;
      question remains whether the significant protective efficacy seen can be achieved with&#xD;
      pre-erythrocytic (sporozoite/liver stage) exposure only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previously, we performed a phase 1 study to investigate the safety, tolerability,&#xD;
      immunogenicity, and protective efficacy of Sanaria PfSPZ CVac with chloroquine (sporozoites,&#xD;
      liver, and blood stage) or pyrimethamine with chloroquine (sporozoites and liver stage only)&#xD;
      to further describe stage specific sterile protection (NIAID protocol #15-I-0169). In this&#xD;
      study, we demonstrated that pyrimethamine is safe to administer, well tolerated, and can&#xD;
      prevent subpatent and patent parasitemia (qPCR and blood smear negative) 100% of the time&#xD;
      during Sanaria PfSPZ CVac. The study also duplicated the results previously reported with&#xD;
      Sanaria PfSPZ CVac with chloroquine in terms of safety profile and protective efficacy&#xD;
      against homologous CHMI. Although a combination of Sanaria PfSPZ- CVac with pyrimethamine and&#xD;
      PfSPZ Challenge at 51,200 PfSPZ did not provide a significant protection level against&#xD;
      homologous CHMI, we demonstrated that some subjects did develop protective immunity without&#xD;
      any evidence of blood stage exposure during PfSPZ-CVac.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Building on these results and taking the lessons learned from other pre-erythrocytic vaccine&#xD;
      studies and models that have shown the importance of reaching a minimal antigen threshold&#xD;
      required for the development of sterile immunity, this proposed study will assess the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, immunogenicity, and protective efficacy of increasing the dose of Sanaria PfSPZ&#xD;
      Challenge sporozoites while receiving the same, or, if needed to successfully prevent&#xD;
      parasitemia, a higher dose of pyrimethamine. Unlike the first study, however, pyrimethamine&#xD;
      will be administered by itself as the partner drug, and will not be co-administered with&#xD;
      chloroquine. The efficacy of PfSPZ-CVac with pyrimethamine will be assessed against CHMI with&#xD;
      homologous parasites (Arm 2a) and CHMI with heterologous parasites (Arm 2b). Additionally, we&#xD;
      will explore the impact of increasing the dose of Sanaria PfSPZ Challenge sporozoites while&#xD;
      receiving chloroquine alone prophylaxis. The efficacy of PfSPZ-CVac with chloroquine will be&#xD;
      assessed only against CHMI with heterologous parasites (Arm 3), as protection against&#xD;
      homologous parasites has now been shown in two separate trials. It will thus be possible to&#xD;
      compare the efficacy of the two partner drugs against heterologous CHMI. The results of this&#xD;
      study will contribute to understanding the targets and mechanisms of immunity against Pf&#xD;
      malaria infection and how the degree of exposure to the parasite (pre-erythrocytic or&#xD;
      erythrocytic stage only or both) impacts these responses and subsequent protective efficacy.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>Chloroquine Phosphate</intervention_name>
    <description>Chloroquine has been widely used for treatment and prophylaxis of malaria since 1946 (Most, London et al. 1984). It was the treatment of choice for uncomplicated malaria for decades because it was safe, well tolerated, affordable and highly effective for the treatment of malaria. However, increasing spread of chloroquine- resistant Pf over the last two decades has severely limited its use (Wellems 2002). Chloroquine phosphate is U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for suppressive treatment (prophylaxis) and for acute attacks of malaria due to P. vivax, P. malariae, P. ovale, and susceptible strains of Pf.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Contingency arms for a higher PYR dose (75mg instead of 50mg) were not enrolled as criteria were not met for their inclusion (50mg of PYR prevented detectable parasitemia in all enrolled arms). The PYR contingency arms that were not enrolled were labelled 1c, 1e, and 1f in the protocol.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>121 participants were screened; 55 participants were assigned to an arm; 66 participants did not meet screening criteria; one subject was consented to two arms, but started on only a control arm.&#xD;
Participants in each Pilot phase were independent; no participant was enrolled in more than one arm or period in either the pilot or main phases.</pre_assignment_details>
