  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study intends to evaluate the nasal mucociliary clearance (NMC) by determining the value&#xD;
      obtained for saccharin transit time (STT) test over the course of 12 hours following a single&#xD;
      cigarette use in adult smokers, to compare it relative to never smokers, and to examine the&#xD;
      relationship between plasma nicotine levels and STT value in smokers and never smokers.&#xD;
      Safety will also be monitored during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The planned maximum study duration for a single study participant from Screening through&#xD;
      completion of study will be 33 days.&#xD;

    <measure>Saccharin Transit Time at t0, Start of Product Use</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Before performing the test, each subject will spend approximately 15 minutes acclimatizing to the environment of the clinic. A 1-2 mm particle of saccharin will be placed under direct vision, approximately 1 cm behind the anterior end of the inferior turbinate. The position of the subject's head should be flexed approximately 10° by visual assessment.&#xD;
The saccharin transit time will be determined as the elapsed time in minutes and seconds from placement of the saccharin until the time the subject perceives a sweet taste.</description>

        <title>Saccharin Transit Time at t0, Start of Product Use</title>
        <description>Before performing the test, each subject will spend approximately 15 minutes acclimatizing to the environment of the clinic. A 1-2 mm particle of saccharin will be placed under direct vision, approximately 1 cm behind the anterior end of the inferior turbinate. The position of the subject's head should be flexed approximately 10° by visual assessment.&#xD;
The saccharin transit time will be determined as the elapsed time in minutes and seconds from placement of the saccharin until the time the subject perceives a sweet taste.</description>

        <description>Ribonucleic Acid quality assessed using the RNA integrity number: measured in the left nostril (Qiazol buffer) using two nasal scraping methods. RNA integrity Number is an algorithm for assessing RNA integrity and based on a numbering system from 1 to 10, with 1 being the most degraded profile and 10 being the most intact.</description>
        <time_frame>Nasal scraping was performed at the final clinic visit, on Day 2, before checkout from the study.</time_frame>
