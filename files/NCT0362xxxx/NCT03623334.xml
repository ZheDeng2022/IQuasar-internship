  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to determine whether daily image guidance and motion assessment/control&#xD;
      will allow treatment of poor performance status patients with stage II-IV NSCLC, who would&#xD;
      benefit from local therapy, with an accelerated course of hypofractionated radiation therapy.&#xD;

      Subjects for this study will be enrolled by the Moncrief Radiation oncology Department at the&#xD;
      Simmons Cancer Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: To escalate the dose of accelerated, hypofractionated, image-guided&#xD;
      conformal radiotherapy to a potent tumorcidal dose without exceeding the maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose in treatment of stage ii-iV nSCLC in patients with poor performance status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives: To evaluate local regional tumor control and overall survival in&#xD;
      patients with stage ii-iV nSCLC and poor performance status treated with accelerated,&#xD;
      hypofractionated, image-guided conformal radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Schema&#xD;
&#xD;
      number of patients between 7-45 (depending on tolerance)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in each dose cohort will all be treated as a single group for dose escalation. The&#xD;
      starting dose will be 3.33 Gy per fraction for 15 fractions (total dose 50 Gy). Subsequent&#xD;
      cohorts of patients will receive a higher dose per fraction as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort No. Fractions Dose per fraction (Gy) Total Dose (Gy) No. Patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 15 3.33 50 7-15&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 15 3.67 55 7-15&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. 15 4.00 60 7-15&#xD;
&#xD;
      Minimum waiting periods will be assigned between each dose cohort to observe toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      each study participant will have the following exams, tests or procedure to help determine if&#xD;
      they are qualified to be in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 8 weeks of enrollment :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Computed tomographic (CT) with contrast of the lung and upper abdomen. a CT done in&#xD;
           conjunction with a Positron emission Tomography (PeT) scan is satisfactory as long as&#xD;
           the images are of adequate quality to be interpreted by a radiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  an MRi of the brain with contrast (or CT if MRi is medically contraindicated).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete Blood Count (CBC) with differential&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Charleston Comorbidity index completion&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 3 days prior to radiotherapy: urine or serum pregnancy test in females of&#xD;
      child-bearing capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 12 weeks of enrollment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      * Pulmonary function tests including spirometry for forced expiratory volume in 1 second&#xD;
      (FeV-1), diffusing capacity (DLCo), and arterial blood gas (Pao-2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to enrollment on the study: Tissue biopsy or cytology confirming non-small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Protocol treatment must begin within 4 weeks after patient registration to the&#xD;
      trial. Patients will receive 15 fractions of radiation. Total dose will depend on the dose&#xD;
      cohort of the study (see schema). The starting dose level will be 3.33 Gy per fraction for 15&#xD;
      fractions (total dose [?] 50 Gy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients must not receive other concomitant antineoplastic therapy (including standard&#xD;
      fractionated radiotherapy to the chest, chemotherapy, biological therapy, vaccine therapy,&#xD;
      and surgery) within a week prior to, during, or within one week after completing&#xD;
      hypofractionated image-guided radiation therapy on protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Patients will be followed until death.&#xD;
