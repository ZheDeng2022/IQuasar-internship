  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A hospital- and community-based study in Luang Prabang, Lao PDR, which will include a group&#xD;
      of hospitalized children 21 days to &lt;18 months of age who are diagnosed with symptoms&#xD;
      compatible with thiamine deficiency disorder (TDD). Based on the infants' response to&#xD;
      thiamine administration, children will be defined as either thiamine responsive disorder&#xD;
      (TRD) cases or non-responders. A community-based comparison group of infants in the same age&#xD;
      range will be included in the study to serve as a control group for identification of&#xD;
      potential risk factors.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study's primary objective is the development of a case definition for TRD among infants&#xD;
      and young children with symptoms consistent with TDD, with the case definition being based on&#xD;
      those clinical symptoms and other predictors that we find are better able to distinguish&#xD;
      those who respond positively to thiamine administration from those who do not respond. As&#xD;
      diagnostic tools available to treating physicians may differ by setting, we will repeat&#xD;
      analyses after excluding from the set of candidate predictors those that are derived from&#xD;
      assessments only available in higher-resource settings, such as laboratory biomarkers and&#xD;
      ultrasonography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary objective is to fill the knowledge gap surrounding biomarkers of thiamine status&#xD;
      in at-risk populations. Biomarker cut-offs for TRD will be developed in the hospital cohort&#xD;
      and distributions will be characterised in both the hospital and community cohorts. The&#xD;
      performance of our proposed cut-off will be compared to the performance of existing&#xD;
      literature cut-offs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, all identified predictors and biomarker cut-offs will be compared across the&#xD;
      community cohort, non-TRD hospital cohort, and TRD hospital cohort to assess the prevalence&#xD;
      of risk factors among apparently healthy infants and young children and assess the usefulness&#xD;
      of the TRD case definition in various settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infants and children in the target age range, who are seeking care at the collaborating&#xD;
      hospital, will be screened by study staff to determine the presence of any of the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria. The list of inclusion criteria has been developed based on a broad range of&#xD;
      TDD-compatible symptoms to reduce the risk of potentially missing children who would respond&#xD;
      clinically to thiamine administration to correct the deficiency. If a child is in the target&#xD;
      age range (21 days to &lt;18 months) meets any one of the inclusion criteria, parental consent&#xD;
      will be obtained and children will be referred to a study physician for a detailed physical&#xD;
      exam. An echocardiogram and cranial ultrasound will be performed to explore the complete&#xD;
      range of TDD complications. A venous blood sample will be obtained by venipuncture for&#xD;
      assessment of indicators of thiamine status. The data collection will follow a structured&#xD;
      timeline after the first thiamine dose has been administered. In particular, the thiamine&#xD;
      administration will be defined as hour zero, and the above described physical exam will be&#xD;
      repeated 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 72 hours after the initial thiamine administration&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be analyzed for whole blood thiamine diphosphate (ThDP) and erythrocyte&#xD;
      transketolase activity coefficient (ETKac), inflammation and cardiac biomarkers and for a&#xD;
      complete blood count (CBC). The purpose of determining these indicators is to better describe&#xD;
      the TRD cases and explore differences between TRD cases, non-TRD children and children in the&#xD;
      community, with the ultimate goal that these indicators may be useful for screening in the&#xD;
      future. Moreover, to determine the association between TRD and maternal thiamine status as a&#xD;
      potential risk factor, investigators will collect a blood sample from infants's mothers to&#xD;
      assess maternal thiamine status, and among breast feeding mothers a breastmilk sample for&#xD;
      assessment of thiamine concentration.&#xD;
