  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exercise rehabilitation has the potential as a non-pharmacological approach to reduce&#xD;
      persistent neuropathic pain in Veterans with lung cancer. By examining the effects of&#xD;
      exercise training in Veteran cancer survivors with NSCLC, there is the potential to&#xD;
      revolutionize care for a: common, debilitating, and inadequately treated symptom in a growing&#xD;
      population. This could lead to a larger investigation to fill critical gaps in the literature&#xD;
      and at the same time help discover a new model of care for Veterans with chronic pain. The&#xD;
      ultimate goal is to reduce this type of pain for the growing population of cancer survivors&#xD;
      while simultaneously reducing the need for problematic opioid management.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Persistent or chronic neuropathic pain, either post-thoracotomy persistent pain (PTPP) or&#xD;
      chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) occurs in a majority of lung cancer&#xD;
      patients. Thus, not only is this neuropathic pain widespread; there is no way to prevent its&#xD;
      development, and long-term use of opioids for control of symptoms could result in addiction.&#xD;
      Ultimately, PTPP and CIPN can lead to long-term suffering and disability during the&#xD;
      post-treatment phase.(NSCLC), which represents about 85% of lung cancer cases.This is the&#xD;
      first project of its kind and the potential impact of this research is large, because&#xD;
      exercise training will be a prescription and the first approach for which NSCLC survivors can&#xD;
      self-manage chronic neuropathic pain. The ultimate goal of the investigators' work is to&#xD;
      reduce neuropathic pain for the growing population of cancer survivors while simultaneously&#xD;
      reducing the need for problematic pharmacologic management. Therefore, results of this study&#xD;
      have potential for high impact on symptom care because it will allow effective neuropathic&#xD;
      pain treatment to be in full control of the Veteran, and likely restore function that is lost&#xD;
      during the chronic pain experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the feasibility of conducting an exercise rehabilitation intervention in&#xD;
           Veterans with NSCLC and PTPP or CIPN.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the effects of a VAMHCS-supervised activity rehabilitation program on&#xD;
           chronic pain compared to delayed control.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess changes in fitness, strength, physical function, fatigue, and quality of life&#xD;
           (QoL) after activity-based rehabilitation compared to control period.&#xD;
