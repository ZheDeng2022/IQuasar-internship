  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The management of pelvic gynecological cancers (PGC) is based on the determination of&#xD;
      extension to guide treatments. The biology of the CGP is constantly evolving and personalized&#xD;
      medicine adapted to this biology is currently in full development. For example, sequencing&#xD;
      ovarian tumors can select patients who can benefit from anti-PARP therapy. There is therefore&#xD;
      a need for patients to have biological samples of their tumor. Various studies on ovarian,&#xD;
      endometrial and cervical cancer have sought to identify the factors predictive of recurrence&#xD;
      of these cancers. The results obtained are very promising. This study will permit to collect&#xD;
      biological samples and detailed clinical data that would allow to test hypotheses and develop&#xD;
      a personalized medicine based on clinical and biological characteristics of patients.&#xD;

      The management of pelvic gynecological cancers (PGC) is based on the determination of the&#xD;
      extension in order to guide the treatments. The biology of PGC is constantly evolving and&#xD;
      personalized medicine adapted to this biology is currently in full development. For example,&#xD;
      sequencing of ovarian tumors allows selection of patients who may benefit from anti-PARP&#xD;
      therapy. There is therefore a need for patients to have biological samples of their tumor.&#xD;
      Various studies on ovarian, endometrial and cervical cancer have sought to identify factors&#xD;
      that predict recurrence of these cancers. The results have obtained are very promising, but&#xD;
      if coordinator team have at our disposal fundamental and translational data related to the&#xD;
      prognosis of PGCs, the coordinator team lack access to a biological collection of these&#xD;
      cancers that would allow us to test our hypotheses and to develop personalized medicine&#xD;
      related to the clinico-biological characteristics of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endometriosis is the 1st cause of chronic pelvic pain (25-40% of women suffering during&#xD;
      sexual intercourse) and represents the 1st cause of school and work absenteeism.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, it is under-diagnosed and too often inappropriately managed. It is considered&#xD;
      that 10 to 15% of the female population of reproductive age has endometriosis. This incidence&#xD;
      reaches 50% in women with infertility. There are many similarities between deep endometriosis&#xD;
      and pelvic cancers, whether on a physiopathological, epidemiological or clinical level. There&#xD;
      are therefore many similarities in the surgical management as well as in the research&#xD;
      strategies.&#xD;
