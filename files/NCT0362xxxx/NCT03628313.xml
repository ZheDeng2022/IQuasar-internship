      Aortic stenosis is the most common valvulopathy in Western countries. Cardiac EchoDoppler is&#xD;
      the reference method for assessment of aortic stenosis and provides prognostic elements.&#xD;
      However, it is imperfect with many inconsistencies between measures. On the other hand, the&#xD;
      prognosis of patients with low flow and low gradient aortic retraction is discussed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this work is to study the prognosis of asymptomatic and symptomatic&#xD;
      aortic retraction.&#xD;

      Aortic stenosis is an attack most often acquired from the aortic valve corresponding to a&#xD;
      defect of opening of this valve. Its prevalence increases with age and approaches 2% at age&#xD;
      65 and 25% at age 85 . It is in the majority of cases degenerative due to the development of&#xD;
      calcifications on the aortic sigmoid valves by a process close to atherosclerosis (Otto CM,&#xD;
      Circulation, 1994). It is associated with cardiovascular risk factors (age, male sex,&#xD;
      smoking, high blood pressure and associated high LDL cholesterol). Aortic stenosis may also&#xD;
      frequently be the consequence of aortic bicuspid (congenital) or more rarely rheumatic fever.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aortic stenosis is responsible for an obstacle to ejection of the left ventricle with&#xD;
      increased afterload and thus left ventricular work. After a long asymptomatic period when the&#xD;
      obstacle to ejection is compensated by the induction of an adaptive left ventricular&#xD;
      hypertrophy, symptoms appear initially of effort (dyspnea, angina, lipothymia see syncope)&#xD;
      then clinical signs of insufficiency heart. The occurrence of symptoms should cause aortic&#xD;
      valve replacement because at this stage the prognosis becomes unfavorable with a risk of&#xD;
      death by cardiac decompensation or sudden death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two pillars of the diagnosis of severity are the evaluation of functional aortic valve&#xD;
      area and the average transvalvular gradient. The tight aortic stenosis is defined for a&#xD;
      functional aortic area &lt;1cm² or 0.6cm² / m² and a mean tranvular gradient&gt; 40 mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient survival data and / or a possible complication or indication for surgery will be&#xD;
      evaluated periodically either during a standard follow-up consultation if patients are&#xD;
      followed in the referral center or by telephone contact with the attending physician or&#xD;
      cardiologist. . In case of death, the cause and date will be collected.&#xD;
