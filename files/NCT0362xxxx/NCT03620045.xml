  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children in rural communities experience significant obesity-related health disparities; they&#xD;
      are 26%-55% more likely to be obese and less likely to have health insurance and access to&#xD;
      weight management specialists than are their urban peers. Geographic-specific disparities in&#xD;
      obesity may be due, in part, to variations in eating behaviors. Children in rural communities&#xD;
      describe purchasing and consuming significantly more energy-dense, low-nutrient food items&#xD;
      relative to their urban peers. Existing behavioral strategies for improving children's EI&#xD;
      patterns have largely been ineffective in reducing risk for excess weight gain. The primary&#xD;
      aim of the proposed study is to test the effects of a brief, novel strategy for improving&#xD;
      rural children's eating behaviors. Specifically, the study aims to harness the&#xD;
      well-documented benefits of an acute bout (20 min) of moderate physical exercise on&#xD;
      children's executive functioning, and to see if these cognitive changes lead to better&#xD;
      self-regulation of eating. If 20 min of moderate physical exercise is associated with&#xD;
      observed improvements in preadolescent children's eating secondary to increases in executive&#xD;
      functioning, these data may offer explicit targets for an obesity prevention trial in rural&#xD;
      Oregon elementary schools.&#xD;
