  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) initiated a generic consistency evaluation program&#xD;
      to evaluate the quality and efficacy of the products manufactured in China in 2016. This is a&#xD;
      bioequivalence study to support the program and to demonstrate the bioequivalence between the&#xD;
      150 mg fluconazole capsule manufactured at Pfizer Dalian, China (the localized originator,&#xD;
      Test) and the 150 mg fluconazole capsule manufactured at Pfizer Fareva, Amboise, France (the&#xD;
      originator, Reference) in healthy Chinese subjects under fasted and fed conditions. This&#xD;
      open-lable, randomized, single-dose 2-way crossover study will enroll approximately 18&#xD;
      subjects for each condition. The primary endpoints are fluconazole area under the plasma&#xD;
      concentration-time curve from time zero to 72 hours post-dose (AUC72) and Cmax.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This trial is a bioequivalence study to support a generic consistency evaluation program,&#xD;
      initiated by the China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA), for the evaluation of quality and&#xD;
      efficacy of the products manufactured in China. The selected strength of 150 mg capsule is&#xD;
      the approved highest strength of capsule formulation in China. The 150 mg dose was selected&#xD;
      for evaluation in this study as it is one of the commonly used clinically approved doses. The&#xD;
      primary objective is to demonstrate the bioequivalence between the 150 mg fluconazole capsule&#xD;
      manufactured at Pfizer Dalian, China (the localized originator, Test) and the 150 mg&#xD;
      fluconazole capsule manufactured at Pfizer Fareva, Amboise, France (the originator,&#xD;
      Reference) administered as a single oral dose in healthy Chinese subjects under fasted and&#xD;
      fed conditions. The primary endpoints are fluconazole area under the plasma&#xD;
      concentration-time curve from time zero to 72 hours post-dose (AUC72) and peak plasma&#xD;
      concentrations (Cmax).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of fluconazole&#xD;
      administered as a single oral dose of 150 mg capsule manufactured at Pfizer Dalian, China and&#xD;
      150 mg capsule manufactured at Pfizer Fareva, Amboise, France in healthy Chinese subjects&#xD;
      under fasted and fed conditions. The secondary endpoint is adverse events (AEs). Other&#xD;
      endpoints include time to reach Cmax (Tmax) of fluconazole, safety laboratory tests and vital&#xD;
      signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each group, subjects will be randomized to one of the 2 treatment sequences. Each&#xD;
      treatment sequence will consist of 2 periods, separated by a washout period of at least 14&#xD;
      days between each period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of each period in both groups, each subject will be administered investigational&#xD;
      product at approximately 8:00 AM (Â± 2 hours). Blood samples for the analysis of fluconazole&#xD;
      in plasma will be collected at pre-dose (within 1 hour prior to dosing) and at 0.25, 0.5, 1,&#xD;
      1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 24, 48 and 72 hours post dose in each period. Vital signs,&#xD;
      physical examination, laboratory tests and 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG) will be performed&#xD;
      at specified times. Tolerability and safety will be assessed for all treatments by monitoring&#xD;
      AEs.&#xD;

             for males and &gt;= 45 kg for females.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Evidence of a personally signed and dated informed consent document indicating that&#xD;
             the subject has been informed of all pertinent aspects of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects who are willing and able to comply with all scheduled visits, treatment plan,&#xD;
             laboratory tests, and other study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects must be of Chinese ethnicity (individuals currently residing in mainland&#xD;
             China who were born in China and have both parents of Chinese descent)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,&#xD;
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurologic, or&#xD;
             allergic disease (including drug allergies, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic,&#xD;
             seasonal allergies at the time of dosing).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Any condition possibly affecting drug absorption (eg, gastrectomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. A positive urine drug screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. History of regular alcohol consumption exceeding 7 drinks/week for female subjects or&#xD;
             14 drinks/week for male subjects (1 drink = 150 mL of wine or 360 mL of beer or (45 mL&#xD;
             of hard liquor) within 6 months of Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Use of tobacco- or nicotine-containing products in excess of the equivalent of 5&#xD;
             cigarettes per day within 3 months of Screening; a positive urine nicotine test.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Treatment with an investigational drug (which has not been approved for registration)&#xD;
             within 30 days preceding the first dose of investigational product. If the&#xD;
             investigational drug has a long elimination half-life, the washout period will be&#xD;
             longer with a recommendation of five elimination half-lives.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Screening BP &gt;=140 mm Hg (systolic) or &gt;=90 mm Hg (diastolic), following at least 5&#xD;
             minutes of rest. If BP is &gt;=140 mm Hg (systolic) or &gt;=90 mm Hg (diastolic), the BP&#xD;
             should be repeated 2 more times and the average of the 3 BP values should be used to&#xD;
             determine the subject's eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Screening supine 12 lead ECG demonstrating a corrected QT (QTc) interval &gt;450 msec or&#xD;
             a QRS complex &gt;120 msec. If QTc exceeds 450 msec, or QRS exceeds 120 msec, the ECG&#xD;
             should be repeated 2 more times and the average of the 3 QTc or QRS values should be&#xD;
             used to determine the subject's eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Female subjects of childbearing potential and fertile male subjects who are unwilling&#xD;

             investigational product.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Female subjects who are breastfeeding or with positive pregnancy test at Screening and&#xD;
             during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;

             a long elimination half-life, the washout period will be longer with a recommendation&#xD;
             of five elimination half-lives. As an exception, acetaminophen/paracetamol may be used&#xD;
             at doses of &lt;=1 g/day. Limited use of nonprescription medications that are not&#xD;
             believed to affect subject safety or the overall results of the study may be permitted&#xD;

             days prior to dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. History of sensitivity to heparin or heparin induced thrombocytopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. History of hypersensitivity to fluconazole or any components of its formulation.&#xD;

             treponema pallidum antibody (TPPA) or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Unwilling or unable to comply with the criteria in the Lifestyle Guidelines described&#xD;
             in this protocol.&#xD;

             the study and their family members, site staff members otherwise supervised by the&#xD;
             investigator, or subjects who are Pfizer employees, including their family members,&#xD;
             directly involved in the conduct of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Other acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition including recent (within the&#xD;
             past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior or laboratory abnormality that may&#xD;
             increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational product&#xD;
             administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the&#xD;
             judgment of the investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for entry into this&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
