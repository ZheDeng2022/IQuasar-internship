    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well liposome-encapsulated daunorubicin-cytarabine and&#xD;
      venetoclax work in treating participants with acute myeloid leukemia that has come back&#xD;
      (relapsed), does not respond to treatment (refractory), or has not been treated (untreated).&#xD;
      Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as liposome-encapsulated daunorubicin-cytarabine and&#xD;
      venetoclax, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the&#xD;
      cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the efficacy (complete remission [CR], complete remission without blood count&#xD;
      recovery [CRi], complete remission without platelet recovery [CRp]) of liposome-encapsulated&#xD;
      daunorubicin-cytarabine (CPX-351) in combination with venetoclax in patients with acute&#xD;
      myeloid leukemia (AML).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess safety of CPX-351 in combination with venetoclax in patients with AML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the event free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with AML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To explore biomarkers of response and resistance in AML treated with CPX-351 and&#xD;
      venetoclax.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of venetoclax.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INDUCTION: Participants receive liposome-encapsulated daunorubicin-cytarabine intravenously&#xD;
      (IV) over 90 minutes on days 1, 3, and 5 of cycle 1 and on days 1 and 3 of cycle 2.&#xD;
      Participants also receive venetoclax orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 2-21. Treatment&#xD;
      repeats every 28 days for up to 2 cycles in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONSOLIDATION: Participants receive liposome-encapsulated daunorubicin-cytarabine IV over 90&#xD;
      minutes on days 1 and 3 and venetoclax PO QD on days 2-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days&#xD;
      for up to 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 30 days and then every 3&#xD;
      months for 3 years.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For the lead in phase: Patients &gt;= 18 years of age with a diagnosis of relapsed and/or&#xD;
             refractory AML will be eligible. Patients who have had prior treatment with venetoclax&#xD;
             will be allowed to participate in the lead in phase and cohort A&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For the dose expansion cohort A (relapsed/refractory [R/R] AML): Patients &gt;= 18 years&#xD;
             of age with a diagnosis of relapsed and/or refractory AML will be eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For the dose expansion cohort B (de novo AML): Patients &gt;= 18 years to 69 years of&#xD;
             age; patients in this cohort must have received no prior therapy for AML&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior therapy with hydroxyurea, hematopoietic growth factors, or tretinoin (ATRA) (for&#xD;
             emergency use for stabilization) is allowed with no washout. A cumulative dose of&#xD;
             ara-C of up to 3 g for emergency stabilization in patients with rapidly proliferating&#xD;
             disease is also allowed provided it was administered &gt; 48 hrs prior to enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bilirubin =&lt; 2 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) =&lt; 3 x upper&#xD;
             limit of normal (ULN) or &lt; 5 x ULN if related to leukemic involvement&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Creatinine =&lt; 1.5 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known cardiac ejection fraction of &gt; or = 45% within the past 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of =&lt; 2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A negative urine or serum pregnancy test is required within 1 week for all women of&#xD;
             childbearing potential prior to enrolling on this trial. A woman of childbearing&#xD;
             potential is defined as a woman who has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least&#xD;
             12 consecutive months, or who had no previous surgical sterilization&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must have the ability to understand the requirements of the study and signed&#xD;
             informed consent. A signed informed consent by the patient or his legally authorized&#xD;
             representative is required prior to their enrollment on the protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the agents used in this study have&#xD;
             the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is a potential&#xD;
             risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with&#xD;
             the chemotherapy agents, breastfeeding should also be avoided&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to active uncontrolled&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA]&#xD;
             class III or IV), unstable angina pectoris, clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia,&#xD;
             or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study&#xD;
             requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient with documented hypersensitivity to any of the components of the chemotherapy&#xD;
             program&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (M3) or core-binding factor AML&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with active central nervous system (CNS) leukemia are excluded since the&#xD;
             antileukemia activity of the treatment components against CNS leukemia are not known&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men and women of childbearing potential who do not practice contraception. Women of&#xD;
             childbearing potential and men must agree to use contraception prior to study entry&#xD;
             and for the duration of study participation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior treatment with CPX-351 or venetoclax. Patients with prior treatment with&#xD;
             venetoclax will be allowed in patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) disease&#xD;
             including those in the lead-in phase as well as those in cohort A&#xD;
