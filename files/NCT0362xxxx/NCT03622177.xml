  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Interleukin33 organize local immune reactions, especially at epithelial barriers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ST2 is the IL33 receptor. The sST2 rate is higher for patient living with HIV and is an&#xD;
      independent predictable factor of mortality. Interleukin33 induce tissue Treg ST2+&#xD;
      lymphocytes proliferation and amphireguline production. Amphireguline is member of epithelial&#xD;
      growth factors family, which contributes to tissue repair, and fibrose. Amphireguline also&#xD;
      helps immunosuppressives functions. Targetting amphiregulin for people living with HIV who&#xD;
      has poor restauration of LTCD4+ could be a future therapy.&#xD;
