      This is a two-armed randomized controlled trial (RCT) primarily aimed at determining if&#xD;
      application of Cytal Wound Matrix 1-Layer intervention to diabetic foot ulcers shows improved&#xD;
      wound closure rates when compared to standard care intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, two-armed, multi-center randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing&#xD;
      Cytal Wound Matrix 1-Layer intervention to standard of care (SOC) intervention in patients&#xD;
      presenting with diabetic foot ulcers (DFU). Up to one hundred and fifty patients recruited&#xD;
      from US based medical centers and randomized (using a 2(active):1(control) randomization&#xD;
      scheme) to receive either Cytal Wound Matrix 1-Layer intervention or standard of care&#xD;
      intervention.Complete wound closure incidence, wound healing rates, wound recurrence, and&#xD;
      various health related quality of life (HRQOL) outcomes will be compared between study arms.&#xD;
      Additionally, a cost effective analysis (i.e. direct and indirect costs) and review of&#xD;
      individual and group changes in narcotic prescription patterns will also be evaluated. While&#xD;
      incidence of wound closure rates will be evaluated through 12 weeks, protocol defined patient&#xD;
      follow-up is for two years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be captured for remaining study objectives during these two years. An independent&#xD;
      biostatistician will review all participant data for power and futility analysis. In&#xD;
      addition, a clinical events committee (CEC) will adjudicate all adverse events (AEs) and&#xD;
      serious adverse events (SAEs).&#xD;

Examples of ancillary care include, but are not limited to, emergency room (ER) visits, urgent care visits, outside medical procedures such as surgery, etc. The incidence of subjects requiring ancillary medical care will be tabulated and compared between randomized groups. This data will be collected via two questions (i.e. &quot;Did participant receive any ancillary medical care?&quot; and &quot;If &quot;yes&quot;, then specify where&quot;). Responses are verified using source documentation.</description>

          <title>Diabetic Foot Ulcer (DFU) Specific Ancillary Medical Care</title>
          <description>This outcome measures the incidence of diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) specific related medical care a study participant receives outside of the medical care provided by the investigator. Examples of ancillary care include, but are not limited to, emergency room (ER) visits, urgent care visits, outside medical procedures such as surgery, etc. The incidence of subjects requiring ancillary medical care will be tabulated and compared between randomized groups. This data will be collected via two questions (i.e. &quot;Did participant receive any ancillary medical care?&quot; and &quot;If &quot;yes&quot;, then specify where&quot;). Responses are verified using source documentation.</description>
