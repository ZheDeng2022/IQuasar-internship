  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single dose-escalation&#xD;
      first-in human study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, PD and immunogenicity of AK111&#xD;
      in healthy subjects following SC administration. The study will consist of cohorts of healthy&#xD;
      subjects. Cohort 1, four unique subjects will be randomized to receive either active AK111&#xD;
      (N=3) or matching placebo (N=1). Cohorts 2, 3, 4 and 5, eight unique subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive either active AK111 (N=6) or matching placebo (N=2). Approximately 36&#xD;
      subjects will be treated in this study.&#xD;

        for participation in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Have the ability to understand and sign a written informed consent form (ICF), which&#xD;
             must be obtained prior to initiation of study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Female or male between 18 and 55 years of age, inclusive, at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Must have a calculated body mass index (BMI) 19 ≤ BMI ≤ 32(inclusive) at screening,&#xD;
             and a total body weight ≥ 50 kg for male or ≥ 45 kg for female at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Females of child bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test in serum at&#xD;
             screening and a negative serum pregnancy test on Day -1, either be of non-child&#xD;
             bearing potential, defined as being:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Postmenopausal (for at least 2 years before screening), verified by serum&#xD;
                  follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level &gt;40 mIU/mL at screening, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Permanently sterilized (eg, tubal occlusion, hysterectomy, bilateral&#xD;
                  salpingectomy), or&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Congenitally sterile&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Women of child-bearing potential must use one of the following methods of&#xD;
             contraception, from screening until at least 120 days after dosing:&#xD;
&#xD;
             A highly effective method with a failure rate of less than 1%:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Implant contraceptive (e.g. Jadelle)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Intra-uterine device (IUD) containing either copper or levonorgestrel (e.g.&#xD;
                  Mirena)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Male sterilization (vasectomy)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Female sterilization (e.g. by bilateral tubal ligation ('tying tubes') or&#xD;
                  hysterectomy)&#xD;
&#xD;
             A method for which the failure rate is between 5% and 10% in real life use, in&#xD;
             combination with a barrier method (male condom):&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Injectable contraceptive (e.g. Depo Provera)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Oral Contraceptive Pill (combined hormonal pill or progestogen-only 'mini-pill')&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Vaginal contraceptive ring (e.g. NuvaRing) Please note that condoms alone are not&#xD;
                  highly effective methods of contraception. Periodic abstinence, the rhythm&#xD;
                  method, and the withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of birth control.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Nonsterilized male subjects who are sexually active with a female partner of&#xD;
             childbearing potential must use an effective method of contraception as listed above&#xD;
             from Day 1 through 120 days after receipt of the last dose of study medication. It is&#xD;
             strongly recommended for the female partner of a male subject to also us an effective&#xD;
             method of contraception throughout this period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Must, in the opinion of the Investigator, be in good general health based upon medical&#xD;
             history, physical examination (including vital signs), 12-lead ECG and clinical&#xD;
             laboratory tests must fall within the clinical laboratory's reference normal ranges&#xD;
             unless the results have been determined by the Investigator to have no clinical&#xD;
             significance).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan, laboratory tests,&#xD;
             and other study procedures as specified in the protocol.&#xD;
