  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preventing falls among people 65 years of age or older is a priority to promote healthy aging&#xD;
      and reduce the number of hospitalizations, institutionalizations and years lived with&#xD;
      disability. A preliminary study carried out at the Balaruc-les-Bains Thermal Center showed&#xD;
      that one-third of people aged 65 are at significant risk of falling. Thermal establishments&#xD;
      could therefore play a role in initiating measures to prevent falls among people aged 65 and&#xD;
      over screened at risk.The main objective is to evaluate the impact on the incidence of falls&#xD;
      at 12 months (M12) to add to the usual care (control group) a program combining, during the&#xD;
      treatment, adapted physical activities (APA) and a Therapeutic patient education (FTE)&#xD;
      followed by an educational follow-up for 12 months (intervention group) for people aged 65&#xD;
      and over who were at risk of falling on arrival at the Thermal&#xD;
