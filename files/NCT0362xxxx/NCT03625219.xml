  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted in 2 cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Cohort A, approximately 40 subjects will participate in a single-center, open-label,&#xD;
      non-randomized, parallel-group trial to investigate the molecular mechanisms involved in&#xD;
      delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) to various antigens and assess the most appropriate skin&#xD;
      challenge antigen to study the effect of systemic treatments on T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following evaluation of the results in Cohort A, approximately 20 healthy volunteers will be&#xD;
      enrolled in Cohort B. This cohort will be a single-center, double-blind, randomized, two-arm,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled study to evaluate the effect of corticosteroid treatment on the molecular&#xD;
      and cellular phenotype of delayed hypersensitivity response to one if the antigens previously&#xD;
      studied in Cohort A.&#xD;

             screening and on Day 1 (baseline).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects has acceptable reaction to selected antigens.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is willing to participate and is capable of giving informed consent. Note:&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  For subject (woman) involved in any sexual intercourse that could lead to pregnancy,&#xD;
             subject agrees that an effective contraceptive method will be used, from at least 4&#xD;
