    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the feasibility and safety of a management approach that incorporates&#xD;
      VT-ablation and S-ICD implantation in secondary prevention patients. This is a single arm&#xD;
      prospective study with 30 patients eligible for implantation of an ICD for the secondary&#xD;
      prevention of sudden cardiac death.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The subcutaneous ICD (S-ICD) is a system without transvenous leads that has been proven to&#xD;
      safely provide defibrillation for patients at risk of sudden cardiac death due to ventricular&#xD;
      tachyarrhythmias. However this system is currently not able to perform anti tachycardia&#xD;
      pacing (ATP) which can terminate some VT, thus avoiding painful shocks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ideally slow VT should be managed with RF ablation while fast VT causing hemodynamic&#xD;
      consequences should be treated with ICD shocks combined with medications. Typically, ICDs in&#xD;
      secondary prevention patients are programmed to intervene at 10 msec at least above the&#xD;
      clinical VT. In cases of hemodynamically stable VT this can result in unnecessary therapies&#xD;
      and lead to ICD shocks. S-ICD can safely manage fast VTs while slower hemodynamically VTs can&#xD;
      be managed with ablation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This approach can avoid transvenous ICD related complications and unnecessary ICD&#xD;
      interventions such as ATP which can accelerate VT to ICD shock zone. However, the benefit of&#xD;
      this management strategy compared to conventional transvenous ICD programming has not been&#xD;
      studied in patients who receive the device for the secondary prevention of sudden cardiac&#xD;
      death.&#xD;
