  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to evaluate an educational video intervention (called Starting the&#xD;
      Conversation) aimed to enhance breast cancer patients' beliefs about and communication with&#xD;
      respect to sexual concerns. In the current study, 128 breast cancer outpatients will be&#xD;
      randomized to either participate in the video intervention and to receive a resource guide&#xD;
      addressing sexual and menopausal health or to receive the resource guide alone. Patients will&#xD;
      be asked to participate in the video and/or read through the resource guide prior to their&#xD;
      clinic visit with their breast cancer provider. The investigators will examine effects of the&#xD;
      interventions on patients' beliefs about communication about sexual health and on patients'&#xD;
      communication about sexual health during clinic visits with their providers. Secondarily, the&#xD;
      investigators will examine effects of the interventions on sexual outcomes and other health&#xD;
      outcomes, including psychological well-being and health-related QOL.&#xD;

    <measure>Self-Reported Self-Efficacy for Communicating About Sexual Health Issues</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Two items assessed patients' self-efficacy (confidence) for communicating with their breast cancer clinician about sexual health concerns in terms of either talking (item 1) or asking (item 2) about sexual health. Response options used an 11-point scale (0=not at all confident/not at all to 10=extremely confident/very much). Mean scores across the two items were used, ranging from 0-10. Higher scores indicate higher self-efficacy.</description>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sexual Function</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Sexual function was assessed using the Lubrication, Vaginal Discomfort, Satisfaction, and Interest domain scores from the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Sexual Function and Satisfaction scale (PROMIS SexFS) Brief Profile Version 2.0. Scores are converted to a T-score metric where a score of 50 equates to the mean of the U.S. population of sexually active adults (SD=10). Higher scores for all domains except Vaginal Discomfort signify better function.</description>

The PEPPI-5 is a five-item scale that measures patient confidence in communicating with providers. Response options are on a scale from 1 (Not at All Confident) to 5 (Very Confident) and are summed for a total self-efficacy score (Range: 5-25).

          <description>Patients will receive a list of web resources on sexual and menopausal health in breast cancer. In addition to the resources, patients will be asked to view an online video called &quot;Starting the Conversation&quot; and to complete an accompanying workbook. Patients in this arm will be asked to review the resource list, watch the Starting the Conversation video, and complete the workbook before their next clinic visit.&#xD;
Starting the Conversation Video: The Starting the Conversation program is designed to increase self-efficacy and outcome expectancies for communicating with providers about sexual health and related issues, reduce barriers to communication, and provide basic training in skills for communicating with providers about these topics, including prioritizing concerns, tips for effective communication, communication practice, and self-feedback.&#xD;

          <title>Self-Efficacy for Communicating About Sexual Health Issues</title>
          <description>Two items assessed patients' self-efficacy (confidence) for communicating with their breast cancer clinician about sexual health concerns in terms of either talking (item 1) or asking (item 2) about sexual health. Response options used an 11-point scale (0=not at all confident/not at all to 10=extremely confident/very much). Mean scores across the two items were used, ranging from 0-10. Higher scores indicate higher self-efficacy.</description>

          <description>Sexual function was assessed using the Lubrication, Vaginal Discomfort, Satisfaction, and Interest domain scores from the PROMIS SexFS Brief Profile Version 2.0. Higher scores for all domains except Vaginal Discomfort signify better function. Scores are converted to a T-score metric where a score of 50 equates to the mean of the U.S. population of sexually active adults (SD=10).</description>
          <population>The sexual interest item was administered to all participants, and the lubrication, vaginal discomfort, and satisfaction items were only administered to participants who reported being sexually active.

          <title>General Self-Efficacy for Communication With Provider</title>
          <description>Patients' self-efficacy for communicating with provider generally, as measured through the Perceived Efficacy in Patient-Physician Interactions Scale (PEPPI-5). The PEPPI-5 is a five-item scale that measures patient confidence in communicating with providers. Response options are on a scale from 1 (Not at All Confident) to 5 (Very Confident) and are summed for a total self-efficacy score (Range: 5-25). Higher scores indicate higher self-efficacy.</description>

          <description>Patient barriers to communication about sexual health, as measured through a 13-item scale. Scale items cover potential reasons a patient might not want to discuss sexual health concerns with her provider (e.g., &quot;I might become embarrassed&quot;). Items are scored on a 1-5 scale where 1=Strongly Disagree and 5=Strongly Disagree and are summed for a total Barrier score (Range: 13-65). Higher scores indicate more perceived barriers to communication.</description>

        <description>Two items assessed patients' self-efficacy (confidence) for communicating with their breast cancer clinician about sexual health concerns in terms of either talking (item 1) or asking (item 2) about sexual health. Response options used an 11-point scale (0=not at all confident/not at all to 10=extremely confident/very much). Mean scores across the two items were used, ranging from 0-10. Higher scores indicate higher self-efficacy.</description>

Starting the Conversation Video: The Starting the Conversation program is designed to increase self-efficacy and outcome expectancies for communicating with providers about sexual health and related issues, reduce barriers to communication, and provide basic training in skills for communicating with providers about these topics, including prioritizing concerns, tips for effective communication, communication practice, and self-feedback.&#xD;

        <description>Two items assessed patients' self-efficacy (confidence) for communicating with their breast cancer clinician about sexual health concerns in terms of either talking (item 1) or asking (item 2) about sexual health. Response options used an 11-point scale (0=not at all confident/not at all to 10=extremely confident/very much). Mean scores across the two items were used, ranging from 0-10. Higher scores indicate higher self-efficacy.</description>

        <title>General Self-Efficacy for Communication With Provider</title>
        <description>Patients' self-efficacy for communicating with provider generally, as measured through the Perceived Efficacy in Patient-Physician Interactions Scale (PEPPI-5). The PEPPI-5 is a five-item scale that measures patient confidence in communicating with providers. Response options are on a scale from 1 (Not at All Confident) to 5 (Very Confident) and are summed for a total self-efficacy score (Range: 5-25). Higher scores indicate higher self-efficacy.</description>

          <description>Five items assessed the belief that discussing treatment side effects with her breast cancer clinician would lead to positive outcomes (e.g., &quot;find a solution to a problem&quot;). Response options used an 11-point scale (0=not at all to 10=very much). Mean scores across the five items were used, ranging from 0-10. Higher scores indicate higher expectancies for positive outcomes.</description>
