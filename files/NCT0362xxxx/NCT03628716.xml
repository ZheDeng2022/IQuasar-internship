      This is a Phase 2, single-arm, multi-institutional clinical trial designed to study the&#xD;
      combination of CV301 with atezolizumab in the first-line treatment of UC not eligible for&#xD;
      cisplatin-containing chemotherapy (Cohort 1) and in the second-line treatment of UC&#xD;
      previously treated with standard first-line cisplatin-based chemotherapy (Cohort 2). The&#xD;
      trial will be performed using an optimal two-stage design within each cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1, Cohort 1: Enroll 14 subjects. If objective response is not achieved in at least four&#xD;
      patients, the cohort will be stopped for futility. If objective response is achieved in at&#xD;
      least four subjects, the cohort will proceed to stage 2. If any patient is not evaluable for&#xD;
      the primary endpoint, the patient may be replaced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1, Cohort 2: Enroll 13 subjects. If objective response is not achieved in at least&#xD;
      three patients, the cohort will be stopped for futility. If objective response is achieved in&#xD;
      at least three subjects, the cohort will proceed to stage 2. If any patient is not evaluable&#xD;
      for the primary endpoint, the patient may be replaced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2, Cohort 1: Enroll an additional 19 subjects. If any patient is not evaluable for the&#xD;
      primary endpoint, the patient may be replaced until a total of 33 patients are evaluable for&#xD;
      the primary endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2, Cohort 2: Enroll an additional 22 subjects. If any patient is not evaluable for the&#xD;
      primary endpoint, the patient may be replaced until a total of 35 patients are evaluable for&#xD;
      the primary endpoint.&#xD;
