  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this project is to understand the likely health effects of cigarette&#xD;
      smokers switching to a Standardized Research Electronic Cigarette (SREC) and to assess the&#xD;
      role of nicotine delivery on switching and acceptability as well as markers of health&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current smokers who meet all eligibility criteria will completely switch from their&#xD;
      combustible (regular) cigarettes to an electronic cigarette (SREC) that either contains 58&#xD;
      mg/ml of nicotine or 0 mg/ml of nicotine in the liquid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' hypothesis is that attempting to switch to a SREC will result in a&#xD;
      reduction in markers of harms to health, as compared with the baseline (smoking) measures.&#xD;
      The investigators also hypothesize that nicotine-containing SRECs will facilitate switching&#xD;
      from smoking more efficiently than zero nicotine SRECs and will result in a significantly&#xD;
      greater improvement in markers of health risk, but will result in higher ratings of&#xD;
      dependence on the SREC (as compared to the zero nicotine SREC).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This project is a prospective parallel-group randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      study in which 240 current smokers who are willing to completely switch from their regular&#xD;
      cigarettes to an electronic cigarette (SREC) for 6 weeks will be randomly allocated to use a&#xD;
      SREC containing either 58 or 0 mg/ml nicotine in the liquid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following randomization to their assigned study product, participants will be supported in&#xD;
      their switching efforts with regular contacts both in person at the Penn State Milton S.&#xD;
      Hershey Medical Center and over the phone. The main measures will be recorded at two&#xD;
      in-person visits after the randomization (switching) visit: (a) 3 weeks after switching and&#xD;
      (b) 6 weeks after switching. All participants will also be followed up at 10 weeks by phone&#xD;
      to identify whether they have continued to use electronic cigarettes or regular cigarettes&#xD;
      and to assess their motivation to change.&#xD;
