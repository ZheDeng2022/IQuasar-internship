  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brain metastases (BM), occurring in 10-30% of adult cancer patients, are an important cause&#xD;
      of morbidity and mortality.The prognosis of patients with BM is generally poor, with a median&#xD;
      survival time of 2-6 months. Whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) has been advocated as the&#xD;
      primary treatment for metastatic brain cancer. WBRT injures small cerebral vasculature and&#xD;
      neuropil,effects linked to imaging-defined white matter changes. However, information on the&#xD;
      neurocognitive function(NCF) impact of WBRT in BM patients is also limited.This study aims to&#xD;
      explore and evaluate the impact of NCF in patients with multiple brain metastases receiving&#xD;
      WBRT.&#xD;

    <description>The patients have received 10 daily fractions of 3 Gy WBRT. Following WBRT treatment, subjects were assessed at each visit for NCT according to the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised(HVLT-R),Mini-Mental Status Examination(MMSE) and Quality Of Life measurements(QOL,Questionnaire-QLQC30).These tests was administered by trained and certified nurses or clinical research associates at baseline,6th week, 3rd, 6th, 9th, 12th month, and every 6 months until PS&gt; 2 or intracranial tumor progression.</description>
