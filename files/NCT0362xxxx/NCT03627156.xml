  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Poor dietary intake affects maternal wellbeing, fetal growth, and development. However, many&#xD;
      pregnant women in Ethiopia have poor dietary intake. To improve the dietary intake of&#xD;
      pregnant women, nutrition education is often given at the community level during a home visit&#xD;
      and at the health institution during antenatal care. Yet, there is no evidence on the effect&#xD;
      of nutrition education on dietary intake, nutritional status, and birth weight in the study&#xD;
      area. Hence, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of guided counseling in&#xD;
      improving dietary practice, nutritional status and birth weight of pregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A two-arm parallel cluster randomized community trial was conducted among pregnant women in&#xD;
      West Gojjam Zone, Amhara region, Ethiopia from May 2019 to May 2019. Baseline data on dietary&#xD;
      practice and nutritional status of pregnant women were collected from May to August 2018&#xD;
      (13weeks). Endline data were collected from October 2018 to May 2019. Guided counseling using&#xD;
      the health belief model and theory of planned behavior was given in the intervention arm (11&#xD;
      clusters) for 10 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnant women were selected using a cluster sampling method. A validated&#xD;
      interviewer-administered structured questionnaire was used for collecting data on the study&#xD;
      subjects both at the baseline and after the intervention. Data were checked, coded and double&#xD;
      entered into Epi-Info version 7.2.2 and exported to SPSS version 23 for statistical analysis.&#xD;
      The outcome of the study finding could be useful for health and nutrition policymakers and&#xD;
      other concerned bodies in decision making and to design effective intervention strategies to&#xD;
      improve dietary practices of pregnant women as a result to prevent malnutrition. 19,553 US&#xD;
      dollar was needed to conduct the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the developed countries, pregnant women take relatively adequate and diversified food&#xD;
      while pregnant women in the developing countries consume inadequate amount and less&#xD;
      diversified diet with very low energy, folate, iron, zinc, and vitamin A content. But, Asian&#xD;
      and African pregnant women took more cereals with a small amount of animal products,&#xD;
      vegetables, and fruits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similarly, the dietary practice of Ethiopian pregnant women has long been an issue of public&#xD;
      health concern since almost all pregnant women take inadequate amount of poor quality diet.&#xD;
      Their energy and nutrient intake was below the recommended average requirement. In the&#xD;
      country, food taboos are highly prevalent; nonetheless, there is a variation on the type of&#xD;
      food considered as taboo and the possible reason for food taboo within the country.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In spite of increasing nutrient demand with increasing gestational age, from the literature&#xD;
      trend of dietary change was different from country to country and within the country.&#xD;
      Pregnant women in developed countries improve their dietary practices with increasing&#xD;
      gestational age. However, pregnant women in developing countries experienced &quot;eating down&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women who had inadequate dietary intake during pregnancy were more likely to develop&#xD;
      under-nourishment compared with their counterparts. Under-nourishment in turn associated with&#xD;
      intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), low birth weight (LBW) and premature delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Not only inadequate intake but also excessive consumption of energy-dense foods associated&#xD;
      with increases the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes such as preeclampsia, gestational&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus, hemorrhage, cesarean-section delivery, infection, birth trauma, macrosomic&#xD;
      infant, delay or failure to lactate, postpartum weight retention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To improve maternal and child nutrition, the Ethiopian government developed food and&#xD;
      nutrition policy, strategy, and programs with guidelines to implement nutrition-specific and&#xD;
      sensitive interventions vital to alleviate nutrition problems. In the country, nutrition&#xD;
      education is often given to pregnant women at the community and health institution. Yet,&#xD;
      pregnant women have insufficient knowledge and poor dietary practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Counseling is a series of professional guidance which aims to change the knowledge, attitude,&#xD;
      and behavior of an individual. Guided counseling is identified as an effective measure to&#xD;
      improve maternal knowledge on nutrition which is the determinant factor of woman's adherence&#xD;
      to a healthy dietary practice. Appropriate dietary practice, in turn, improves nutritional&#xD;
      status and birth weight of pregnant women. From the literature, the health belief model and&#xD;
      theory of planned behavior constructs are effective to improve the dietary practice of&#xD;
      pregnant women. In this study, guided counseling refers to professional guidance based on the&#xD;
      health belief model and the theory of planned behavior to improve dietary practice,&#xD;
      nutritional status, and birth weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence, the aim of this study was to assess the effect of guided counseling in improving&#xD;
      dietary practice, nutritional status and birth weight of pregnant women in West Gojjam Zone.&#xD;
      Dietary practice means the dietary intake of pregnant women. Trimester based nutrition&#xD;
      counseling was implemented(the women were counseled to increase portion size and frequency of&#xD;
      meal with increasing gestational age). The study used the health belief model and theory of&#xD;
      planned behavior constructs and counseling card to counsel the women. Besides, a leaflet with&#xD;
      appropriate pictures was given to the women to use it at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The study was conducted among pregnant women in West Gojjam Zone, Amhara Region,&#xD;
      Ethiopia from May 2018 to May 2019. Baseline data on dietary practice and nutritional status&#xD;
      of pregnant women were collected from May to August 20/2018 (13weeks). Endline data were&#xD;
      collected from October 2018 to May 2019. Therefore, a time frame to the second, third and&#xD;
      fourth objective was 8months. The study used mixed methods design; quantitative and&#xD;
      qualitative study and cluster randomized controlled community trial. Single population&#xD;
      proportion formula was used to estimate the sample size for objective I while G power 3.1.9.2&#xD;
      software was used to determine the sample size for objective II, III and IV. Respondents were&#xD;
      selected using a randomized cluster sampling technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Community-based guided counseling using the health belief model and theory of planned&#xD;
      behavior was the intervention package for this study. The core contents of guided counseling&#xD;
      were the following: increasing frequency of meal (consumption of at least one additional meal&#xD;
      in the second and at least two additional meals during the third trimester of pregnancy),&#xD;
      increasing portion size with gestational age, using iodized salt, taking iron/folic acid&#xD;
      supplement, eating diversified food by giving emphasis to iron-rich foods, taking fruits and&#xD;
      vegetables, include animal source foods in the diet (at least two servings per day), reducing&#xD;
      heavy workload, taking daytime rest, using malaria prevention methods and health service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, the consequence of inadequate dietary intake, susceptibility to the consequence of&#xD;
      insufficient die, the severity of the consequence of inadequate meal intake were also parts&#xD;
      of the core content of guided counseling. Attitude, subjective norms, self-efficacy,&#xD;
      perceived control, intention, knowledge and dietary practice of pregnant women were also&#xD;
      assessed before each counseling session. Then, counseling was given based on the identified&#xD;
      gap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention began before 16 weeks of gestation. Each pregnant woman attended 4&#xD;
      counseling sessions. Each counseling session lasting in 30-60 minutes depending on the number&#xD;
      of participants (monthly). Leaflet with core messages in Amharic with appropriate picture was&#xD;
      prepared and delivered to each pregnant woman in the intervention arm to use it in their&#xD;
      home. Three nurses who have a Bachelor of Science and two public health professionals were&#xD;
      recruited as counselor and supervisor of counseling intervention, respectively. Women in the&#xD;
      control arm received traditional nutrition education given by the existing health system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcomes of the intervention were measured during 36-37 weeks of pregnancy. Birth weights&#xD;
      were measured within 48hours after delivery. The first, second and third outcomes of this&#xD;
      intervention were dietary practice and nutritional status of the pregnant women, and birth&#xD;
      weight, respectively. Data safety have been monitored by the Data Safety Monitoring Board&#xD;
      (DSMB). Data were collected by interviewer-administered questionnaires adapted from previous&#xD;
      literature and modified based on the local context.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data on the socio-demographic and obstetric characteristics were collected during the&#xD;
      baseline using a structured questionnaire. Whereas, data on women's knowledge about maternal&#xD;
      diet, household food security status, dietary practice, Health Belief Model and Theory of&#xD;
      Planned Behavior constructs, Mid-Upper Arm Circumference, weight, and blood pressure were&#xD;
      collected before and after implementation of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dietary practices of pregnant women were assessed by a food frequency questionnaire. The&#xD;
      nutritional status of pregnant women was assessed using the Mid-Upper Arm Circumference&#xD;
      measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six female diploma nurses and three public health professionals were recruited as data&#xD;
      collector and supervisor, respectively. Additionally, three laboratory technicians were&#xD;
      recruited to confirm pregnancy. Women who took four or more meals a day and have high Women&#xD;
      Dietary Diversity Score and Food Variety Score above the mean and high Animal Source Food&#xD;
      consumption were considered as having appropriate dietary practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data were entered using Epi Info version 7.2.2 software and analyzed by SPSS version 23&#xD;
      software. Descriptive statistics were computed. Bivariate and multivariable logistic&#xD;
      regression analysis was done. A p-value &lt; 0.2 was used as a cut-off point to select variables&#xD;
      for the final model. P-values &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-intervention and post-intervention differences in women's dietary diversity score, food&#xD;
      variety score, animal source food consumption, dietary practice and nutritional status&#xD;
      between the intervention and control groups will be analyzed by using paired sample t-test&#xD;
      for continuous variables and chi-squared test for the categorical variables. Dietary&#xD;
      practice, nutritional status, and birth weight being nested within clusters, hence mixed&#xD;
      effects binary logistic regression models, mixed effects linear logistic regression models&#xD;
      and mixed effects multinomial logistic regression model will be used to measure the&#xD;
      difference in effect on the dietary practice, nutritional status and birth weight between the&#xD;
      intervention groups taking into account for clusters and report the Intraclass correlation&#xD;
      coefficient, respectively. Cluster level variables will be analyzed as a random effect in the&#xD;
      models, whereas the first level predictors will be managed as a fixed effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various measures have been taken to maintain the quality of the research starting from&#xD;
      designing the tool to data analysis and interpretation of the result. The questionnaires were&#xD;
      adapted and pretested. Three days of intensive training was given to the counselors, data&#xD;
      collectors, and supervisors using the training manual. An equal number and non-adjacent&#xD;
      clusters for intervention and control group were taken from each Woreda to neutralize the&#xD;
      effect of variations if any. Close supervision has been done by supervisors and principal&#xD;
      investigator during counseling and data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cross-sectional phenomenological qualitative study using both key informant interviews and&#xD;
      focus group discussions have been used to supplement the quantitative data. Qualitative data&#xD;
      was collected until saturation of information. Typical case sampling and extreme sampling&#xD;
      technique were used to select the study participants for the key informant interviews and&#xD;
      homogeneous sampling for focus group discussions. Semi-structured interview and focus group&#xD;
      discussion guides were developed to collect qualitative data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assure the quality of data the interviews and facilitation of focus group discussions were&#xD;
      done by a principal investigator. To assure trustworthiness triangulation was used in data&#xD;
      sources, during data collection and research methodologies. Thematic framework analysis&#xD;
      technique will be used to analyze data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Bahir Dar University. Written&#xD;
      permission was obtained in West Gojjam zone and each Woreda administrators. The intervention&#xD;
      was registered in Clinical Trials.gov. Written consent was secured from each participant&#xD;
      after explaining the purpose of the study, the right of the participants to withdraw from the&#xD;
      study at any time during the study period, potential risk and benefits. Confidentiality has&#xD;
      been maintained throughout the study. Undernourished women and women with high blood pressure&#xD;
      have been referred to the nearby health institution for treatment. Written consent was&#xD;
      secured from individuals who give their picture for leaflet preparation. If the intervention&#xD;
      is effective, the project will be implemented in the control area.&#xD;
