  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies how well anti-PD-L1/TGFbetaRII fusion protein M7824 (M7824) works&#xD;
      in treating patients with stage II-III HER2 positive breast cancer. Immunotherapy with M7824&#xD;
      may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of&#xD;
      tumor cells to grow and spread.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the change in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) percentage pre and post&#xD;
      M7824 therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of M7824 in early stage breast cancer (stage&#xD;
      II/III).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate pathological response at the time of surgery after 2 doses of M7824 followed&#xD;
      by neoadjuvant (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) HER2 targeted therapy in&#xD;
      combination with chemotherapy of physician's choice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate imaging based response to M7824. II. To evaluate potential systemic and tumor&#xD;
      based predictive biomarker candidates of response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate immune responses induced by exposure to M7824 systemically and in tumor&#xD;
      microenvironment (TME).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive anti-PD-L1/TGFbetaRII fusion protein M7824 intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on&#xD;
      days 1 and 15. During days 28-56 patients receive planned neoadjuvant chemotherapy.&#xD;
