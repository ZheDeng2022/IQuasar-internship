      The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of the EMG-driven exoskeleton hand&#xD;

      The purpose of this study was to 1) examine the effects of EMG-driven robot-assisted&#xD;
      intervention, and 2) examine whether the robot-assisted therapy is as effective as&#xD;
      conventional intervention. The study was conducted using a randomized, two-period crossover&#xD;
      design. Participants were randomly assigned to group 1 or group 2 using a computer-generated&#xD;
      list. Participants in group 1 received 12 sessions of robot-assisted intervention first,&#xD;
      followed by a one-month washout period, and then received 12 sessions of conventional&#xD;
      intervention. Participants in group 2 received 12 sessions of conventional intervention&#xD;
      first, followed by a one-month washout period, and then received 12 sessions of&#xD;
      robot-assisted intervention. Outcome measures were performed before the intervention, after&#xD;
      the first 12-session intervention, and after the second 12-session intervention.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change scores of Fugl-Myer Assessment (FMA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, after completing the first 12-session intervention sessions (around 4 weeks after baseline); after completing the second 12-session intervention sessions (around 12 weeks after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The UE-FMA subscale will be used to assess the sensorimotor impairment level of UE in patients after stroke. The UE-FMA contains 33 movements with a score range from 0 to 66. A higher UE-FMA score indicates less impairment of the paretic limb. The validity and reliability of FMA is good to excellent.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change scores of Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, after completing the first 12-session intervention sessions (around 4 weeks after baseline); after completing the second 12-session intervention sessions (around 12 weeks after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The WMFT is a reliable method to evaluate the UE motor ability in patients after stroke. The WMFT contains 15 function-based tasks and 2 strength-based tasks. The time (WMFT-time) and the functional ability (WMFT-quality) for an individual to complete the tasks will be recorded. A shorter WMFT-time and a larger WMFT-quality score indicate a faster movement and better quality of movement, respectively.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change scores of Motor Activity Log (MAL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, after completing the first 12-session intervention sessions (around 4 weeks after baseline); after completing the second 12-session intervention sessions (around 12 weeks after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The MAL will be used to assess the amount of use (AOU) and quality of movement (QOM) of the paretic UE. The MAL is a semi-structured interview that tests object manipulation and gross motor activities of daily living. The psychometric properties of MAL have been well-established, and a higher MAL score indicates better movement quality.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change scores of Action Research Arm Test (ARAT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, after completing the first 12-session intervention sessions (around 4 weeks after baseline); after completing the second 12-session intervention sessions (around 12 weeks after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) evaluates 19 tests of arm motor function, both distally and proximally. Each test is given an ordinal score of 0, 1, 2, or 3, with higher values indicating better arm motor status. The total ARAT score is the sum of the 19 tests, and thus the maximum score is 57.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change scores of Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, after completing the first 12-session intervention sessions (around 4 weeks after baseline); after completing the second 12-session intervention sessions (around 12 weeks after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) is the most commonly administered psychometric screening assessment of cognitive functioning. The MMSE is used to screen patients for cognitive impairment, track changes in cognitive functioning over time, and often to assess the effects of therapeutic agents on cognitive function. The total score of MMSE ranged from 0 to 30. Higher values represent a better cognitive functioning.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change scores of Jamar hand dynamometer</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, after completing the first 12-session intervention sessions (around 4 weeks after baseline); after completing the second 12-session intervention sessions (around 12 weeks after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Jamar hand dynamometer is the most widely cited in the literature and accepted as the gold standard by which other dynamometers are evaluated. Excellent concurrent validity of the Jamar hand dynamometer is reported. The Jamar hand dynamometer measure the grip-strength. The norm of healthy male aged 18 to 75 years is from 64.8 lb to 121.8 lb, while the norm of healthy female aged 18 to 75 years is from 41.5 lb to 78.7 lb. Higher value represent a greater grip-strength.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change scores of stroke self-efficacy questionnaire (SSEQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, after completing the first 12-session intervention sessions (around 4 weeks after baseline); after completing the second 12-session intervention sessions (around 12 weeks after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>the Stroke Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (SSEQ) , a questionnaire developed to measure the most relevant self-efficacy and self-management domains specific to the stroke population. It contains 13 items that are rated on a 0 - 10 scale, with higher scores indicating greater levels of self-efficacy. Questionnaire includes a range of relevant functional tasks such as walking, getting comfortable in bed, as well as some self-management tasks.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change scores of Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, after completing the first 12-session intervention sessions (around 4 weeks after baseline); after completing the second 12-session intervention sessions (around 12 weeks after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The MAS is a 6-point ordinal scale that measures muscle spasticity in patients with brain lesions. Higher score indicates higher muscle tone. Investigators will assess the MAS scores of UE muscles, including biceps, triceps, wrist flexors and extensors, and finger flexors and extensors. The validity and reliability of MAS for patients with stroke were established to be adequate to good.</description>
