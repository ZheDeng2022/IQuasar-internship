      The purpose of the study is to assess precision of the GE Lunar iDXA, Hologic Horizon W DXA&#xD;
      scanner, and the Stratec peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) scanner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To assess standard deviation (SD) and coefficient of variation (CV) of testing bone&#xD;
      mineral, bone geometry, and soft tissues in inanimate objects and adults. Tests on adults&#xD;
      will be structured to assess:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Within- and between-day variability of testing&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Within- and between-technician variability of testing&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Variability due to positioning and post-scan processing&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Variability due to different DXA scanning equipment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To assess the least significant change (LSC) for testing bone mineral and soft tissues&#xD;
      in adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To assess strengths and limitations of DXA and pQCT testing, including sensitivity to&#xD;
      movement, rate of re-rescanning, etc. which are crucial components for demonstrating&#xD;
      feasibility in grant applications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4: To construct a database of DXA and pQCT test results and quality control procedures,&#xD;
      showing our laboratory's quality control level.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Osteoporosis and obesity are highly prevalent and disabling chronic diseases. Osteoporosis is&#xD;
      a disease of low bone mass, which predisposes people to bone fragility and increased risk of&#xD;
      bone fractures. Obesity is a disease characterized by excess body fat levels, which&#xD;
      predisposes people to diabetes, heart disease, stroke, hypertension, cancer, sleep apnea,&#xD;
      osteoarthritis, and gallbladder disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An essential component to research on the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis and&#xD;
      obesity is a valid method for monitoring body fat levels and bone mineral density. Dual&#xD;
      energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is a method for analyzing bone mineral density and body&#xD;
      composition, particularly bone mineral content, fat mass and lean mass in children and&#xD;
      adults. DXA scanners use an X-ray tube to produce radiation, which is then filtered into low-&#xD;
      and high-energy beams. These beams of radiation are emitted from beneath a table that the&#xD;
      supine human body is lying on. The arm, which passes above the person, detects the&#xD;
      attenuation of the radiation for each pixel the body occupies. Based on known attenuation&#xD;
      levels of different human tissues, the imaging software provides information on the&#xD;
      composition of each pixel of the body. These pixels are then summed to provide information&#xD;
      on: total body bone mineral content, total bone mineral density, fat mass, and lean mass. The&#xD;
      DXA can also assess regional body composition (e.g. trunk fat), which is of importance in&#xD;
      evaluating health effects of body fatness patterns. Using standard protocols, bone mineral&#xD;
      content and density can be assessed in areas of the body indicating high risk of fractures&#xD;
      (e.g. hip and lumbar spine) or areas that are likely to be responsive to dietary or physical&#xD;
      activity manipulations (e.g. lumbar spine and radius).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) is a 3-dimensional imaging technique that&#xD;
      goes beyond the 2-dimensional imaging of DXA to assess both true volumetric bone density and&#xD;
      bone geometry, the two key components of bone strength. Additionally, it can divide bone into&#xD;
      its component parts, i.e. separately assessing bone density and bone geometry of cortical and&#xD;
      trabecular bone. As such, the measurements obtained from pQCT provides a more complete&#xD;
      picture of what may be occurring within bone tissue that contributes to either bone gain or&#xD;
      bone loss, depending on the population and question of interest. pQCT assesses parameters of&#xD;
      bone strength at the radius (forearm) and tibia (lower leg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A vital component of any clinical and research program is precision testing, which assesses&#xD;
      the reproducibility of DXA and pQCT measurements within an individual technician and/or&#xD;
      between multiple technicians. This study was designed to address our facility's needs and&#xD;
      ethical requirement to complete precision testing. This precision testing is a necessary&#xD;
      component of verifying the feasibility and validity of the method, as well as&#xD;
      cross-calibrating DXA scanners in our multi-site studies. We are completing this testing with&#xD;
      the two DXA scanners, the GE Lunar iDXA and the Hologic Horizon W DXA, as well as with the&#xD;
      Stratec XCT 3000 pQCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A vital component of any clinical and research program is precision testing, which assesses&#xD;
      the reproducibility of DXA measurements within an individual technician and/or between&#xD;
      multiple technicians. As alluded to above, the validity of bone and soft tissue measurements&#xD;
      by DXA and pQCT is related to the skill of the technician in: 1) properly positioning the&#xD;
      person before scanning and 2) properly analyzing the scan images afterward. Both of these&#xD;
      components are subjective, requiring experience and feedback to improve technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From an ethical standpoint, a level of technician competency is important in ensuring that&#xD;
      both research volunteers and the technician are not exposed to radiation without the benefit&#xD;
      of acceptable scan results. From a clinical and research standpoint, understanding the&#xD;
      inherent variability in testing is an important component in planning and executing research&#xD;
      studies having bone or body fat outcomes. As described the Conference of Radiation Control&#xD;
      Program Directors, Inc. (CRCPD), and as established by the International Society of Bone&#xD;
      Densitometry (ISCD), measurement of precision is a key component for assessing:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The smallest change (least significant change, LSC) in bone density that is biologically&#xD;
           significant&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The time interval between measurements necessary to detect changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Precision testing requires that multiple scans be completed on individuals representative of&#xD;
      the primary target population of interest, sometimes within a fairly short period of time.&#xD;
      This exposure of additional radiation to a select group of individuals has created&#xD;
      controversy about whether precision testing is necessary and ethical. The CRCPD and ISCD has&#xD;
      fully supported precision testing, and recommended that it be a routine practice in all DXA&#xD;
      sites. The CRCPD states that, &quot;Some states without understanding the need for precision&#xD;
      testing have prohibited the measurement despite low radiation doses and limited numbers of&#xD;
      repeat densitometry determinations. Their major concern, of course, is the apparent&#xD;
      unnecessary radiation to a few, select patients. To address the benefit versus risk issue,&#xD;
      those exposed to the additional, small amount of radiation (equal to approximately an&#xD;
      additional 6-12 hours of background radiation) are providing a benefit to themselves and all&#xD;
      others by validating the results of bone mineral density (BMD) exams for that facility.&#xD;
      Without precision testing, the BMD study is of no value resulting in thousands of patients&#xD;
      being exposed to unnecessary radiation.&quot;&#xD;
