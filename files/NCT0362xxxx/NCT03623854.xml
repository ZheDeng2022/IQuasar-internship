    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well nivolumab and relatlimab work in treating participants&#xD;
      with chordoma that has spread to other places in the body. Monoclonal antibodies, such as&#xD;
      nivolumab and relatlimab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the clinical benefit of the combination of nivolumab and relatlimab in patients&#xD;
      with advanced chordomas by objective response rate (ORR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Ascertain the safety of nivolumab in combination with relatlimab in subjects with&#xD;
      metastatic or locally advanced/unresectable chordoma by the frequency of adverse events&#xD;
      (AEs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Assess the clinical benefit of the combination of nivolumab and relatlimab in patients&#xD;
      with advanced chordomas by progression free survival (PFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Compare response rate (RR) and clinical benefit rate (CBR) in patients whose tumors are&#xD;
      PD-L1+ and PD-L1- at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Compare RR and CBR in patients whose tumors are LAG-3+ and LAG-3- at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. In the patients who are PD-L1 positive, compare RR and CBR in patients with 1% and 5%&#xD;
      tumor membrane staining.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Determine the response to treatment based on the baseline mutation load. IV. Determine&#xD;
      the ORR and CBR via Choi criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes and relatlimab via infusion&#xD;
      over 60 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 28 days for up to 2 years in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up within 100 days.&#xD;
