  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to demonstrate safety and feasibility of the Thermedical Ablation&#xD;
      System and Durablate needle catheter in subjects with recurrent, monomorphic ventricular&#xD;
      tachycardia (VT) who have failed conventional treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to gather information on the safety and effectiveness of a new&#xD;
      ablation catheter called the Durablateâ„¢ Saline Enhanced Radiofrequency (SERF) catheter. This&#xD;
      catheter is being studied to treat ventricular tachycardia (VT) in patients who have already&#xD;
      been treated with medicine, have an Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) and had an&#xD;
      ablation procedure to treat their VT but continue to experience VT despite these treatments.&#xD;
      A VT ablation procedure is done by finding the abnormal heart tissue that's causing the VT&#xD;
      and applying energy with the tip of an ablation catheter to the area to create a scar or&#xD;
      destroy the tissue that causes the VT. The SERF catheter being used in this study uses a&#xD;
      needle to deliver heated saline (salt water) and radiofrequency energy deeper into the heart&#xD;
      tissue that is causing the VT than a standard ablation catheter.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subject has sustained, monomorphic VT&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject has recurrent, symptomatic VT&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject has drug refractory or drug intolerant sustained VT following use of at least&#xD;
             one Class III antiarrhythmic as demonstrated by a recurrent arrhythmia and is not a&#xD;
             suitable candidate per the investigator's expert opinion for ongoing or alternative&#xD;
             drug therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. ECG and/or ICD evidence of a spontaneous VT recurrence within the prior 6 months that&#xD;
             is suspected to be the same VT as initially targeted in a prior ablation&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject has minimum 3-month ICD interrogation history available for evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subject has LVEF &gt; 20%, confirmed by echo or comparable technique during baseline&#xD;
             evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subject is at least 18 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subject has signed the informed consent, and is willing and able to participate in all&#xD;
             study procedures and follow up requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects with VT of idiopathic origin&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects with VT with ECG or MRI/CT findings suggestive of right ventricular free wall&#xD;
             origin&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects with VTs of septal origin require special care to minimize the risk of heart&#xD;
             block, particularly within 2 cm of the AV node/proximal conduction system; Subjects&#xD;
             requiring ablation at such locations should only be included when the arrhythmia&#xD;
             itself is life-threatening or otherwise sufficiently severe to justify the risk&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject with myocardial infarction (MI) or unstable angina within previous 60 days&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject with cardiac surgery or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) within&#xD;
             previous 60 days&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subject with class IV (NYHA) heart failure&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subject with prosthetic cardiac valve(s), severe aortic stenosis or flail mitral valve&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subject with left ventricular assist device planned or required for the procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Subjects with co-morbidities such that they have less than 1-year life expectancy&#xD;
&#xD;

             transesophageal echo (TEE) or transthoracic echo (TTE) (with contrast) prior to&#xD;

&#xD;
         11. Subject with thrombocytopenia or other coagulopathy&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Women who are or may potentially be pregnant (must be post-menopausal or have a&#xD;
             negative pregnancy test)&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Subject with other acute illness or active systemic infection (unrelated to VT or its&#xD;
             origin)&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Significant congenital heart disease or cardiac anomaly&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Allergy or contraindications to the medications/agents used during a standard&#xD;
             ablation/EP intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Subject concurrently enrolled in any other investigational drug or device study&#xD;
