  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The standard or usual treatment for this disease is to undergo chemotherapy to slow the&#xD;
      spread of the disease and relieve some symptoms of cancer. Patients will have already had at&#xD;
      least one chemotherapy treatment for their disease at this stage.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CFI-400945 is a new type of drug for breast cancer. Laboratory tests show that it works by&#xD;
      blocking a specific protein called Polo-like Kinase 4 (PLK4) that is involved in cancer cell&#xD;
      growth. CFI-400945 may slow down the growth of cancer cells or may cause cancer cells to die.&#xD;
      This drug has been shown to shrink tumours in animals and has been studied in some patients&#xD;
      and appears well tolerated with little side effects. CFI-400945 seems promising but it is not&#xD;
      clear if it can offer better results than standard therapy.&#xD;

&#xD;
                    -  loss or mutation of PTEN, as assessed by IHC assay (COHORT 2) OR&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  No loss or mutation of PTEN, as assessed by IHC assay (COHORT 3)&#xD;
&#xD;

        documented after enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Only female patients will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients must have a formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue block (from primary&#xD;
             or metastatic tumour) available and must have provided informed consent for the&#xD;
             release of the block. Biopsies are optional but strongly encouraged for patients with&#xD;
             accessible disease suitable for biopsy. The timing of tumour biopsies for patients who&#xD;
             provide informed consent and willing is prior to treatment (after enrollment), and&#xD;
             again between cycle 2 day 15- day 22. An additional biopsy at the time of progression&#xD;
             in patients with clinical benefit is also encouraged. Lesions planned for biopsy may&#xD;
             not be the only target lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;

             therapy may be considered eligible after discussion with CCTG. There is no limit to&#xD;
             the number of prior chemotherapy regimens&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may have received other therapies including endocrine therapy, immunotherapy,&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Previous surgery is permitted provided that a minimum of 21 days (3 weeks) have&#xD;
             elapsed between any major surgery and date of enrollment and that wound healing has&#xD;

             regulatory requirements. Each patient must sign a consent form prior to enrollment in&#xD;
             the trial to document their willingness to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be accessible for treatment and follow up. Patients enrolled on this&#xD;
             trial must be treated and followed at the participating centre. This implies there&#xD;
             must be reasonable geographical limits (for example: 1 ½ hour's driving distance)&#xD;

             or their components.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with HER2 positive breast cancer (based on the most recent assessment).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with significant cardiac (including uncontrolled hypertension) or pulmonary&#xD;
             disease, or active CNS disease or infection. Patients should have a LVEF ≥ 50%.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not receive concurrent treatment with other anti-cancer therapy (other&#xD;
             than bone-targeted therapy, if already taking and stable) or investigational agents&#xD;
             while on protocol therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;

             CFI-400945m and these drugs. In addition, patients must avoid consumption of the fruit&#xD;
             or juice of Seville oranges (e.g. marmalade), grapefruit, pomelos and star fruit from&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients being treated with full dose warfarin. Patients with history of deep vein&#xD;
             thrombosis or pulmonary embolus who are being treated with therapeutic doses of low&#xD;
