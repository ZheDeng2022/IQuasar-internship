  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 39 million people of adults aged 20-79 are living with Diabetes in MENA region&#xD;
      in 2017, Egypt is number 8 in the top 10 countries in number of adults with Diabetes (8.2&#xD;
      million), where Egypt represents 21% of the Diabetics in MENA region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metformin is used as 1st line oral anti-diabetic drug in most cases. Sulfonylureas (SU) are&#xD;
      used as frequent first add-on after failure of metformin monotherapy. Sodium Glucose&#xD;
      Co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are a newer class of therapy which has a lower incidence&#xD;
      of hypoglycemia and in addition helps in weight and BP reduction. In Egypt, SGLT2 inhibitors&#xD;
      were introduced in 2016. It is not yet widely used for various reasons including lack of wide&#xD;
      clinical experience in Egyptian patients and safety concerns particularly related to&#xD;
      infections and some rare Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA). Also, usage of SGLT2 inhibitors is&#xD;
      limited in the early stage of diabetes as they are usually preferred as 3rd or 4th add-on&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The existing dapagliflozin phase-3 clinical trial program on SGLT2 inhibitors didn't include&#xD;
      subjects from Egypt. There is no study available which evaluates the effect of dapagliflozin&#xD;
      in real world scenario in Egypt. Key opinion leaders in diabetes in Egypt have also&#xD;
      identified the need for study on Egyptian subjects to observe the usage pattern and effect of&#xD;
      dapagliflozin, a SGLT2 inhibitor, in this specific real world setting. Therefore, there is a&#xD;
      need for data on real world setting across Egypt. With this aim in mind, the present study&#xD;
      has been planned.&#xD;

        This study is a non-interventional, multi centre, retrospective -prospective, observational&#xD;
        study to be conducted at up to 50 sites in Egypt. The study targets to enroll 200 patients.&#xD;
        The study would enroll T2DM patients who are/were inadequately controlled (HbA1c &gt;7%) with&#xD;
        existing antidiabetic medications and who have been prescribed dapagliflozin at least 3&#xD;
        months prior to study initiation. No study medication will be prescribed or administered as&#xD;
        a part of study procedure. Patients, who have been treated as per Investigators' routine&#xD;
        clinical practice and prescribed dapagliflozin at least 3 months before will be screened&#xD;
        for enrolment in study. Dosage of dapagliflozin and other medications should be as per the&#xD;
        routine clinical practice and prescribing information. The study will be initiated after&#xD;
        obtaining written approval of Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) /Institutional Review&#xD;
        Board (IRB).&#xD;
