      Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an emerging treatment for medically&#xD;
      refractory major depressive disorder (MDD), and involves direct stimulation of cortical&#xD;
      neurons using externally applied, powerful, focused magnetic field pulses. rTMS consistently&#xD;
      achieves response rates of 50-55% and remission rates of 30-35% in medically refractory MDD&#xD;
      patients. However, the vast majority of studies have focused its use in outpatient samples.&#xD;
      This study will address whether accelerated rTMS (intermittent Theta Burst Stimulation&#xD;
      (iTBS)) can speed up the response rate and shorten length of stay in hospital for inpatients,&#xD;
      and which biological traits may predict response.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a highly prevalent and disabling disorder with substantial&#xD;
      societal cost; furthermore, the costs associated to MDD increase substantially when it&#xD;
      requires hospital admission. Among Neurological, Mental and Substance Use (NMS) disorders,&#xD;
      depression is the number one cause of disability worldwide. Considering this high increase in&#xD;
      prevalence, in addition to the limited efficacy of current treatments, with only 30-40% of&#xD;
      patients achieving remission after an initial treatment, the illness burden attributable to&#xD;
      NMS is projected to increase during the next decade. In Ontario alone, $12.5 billion a year&#xD;
      is attributed to mood disorder related costs. Unfortunately, research into the treatment and&#xD;
      prevention of mental illness is disproportionately low relative to the disease burden.&#xD;
      Approved by Health Canada for MDD in 2002, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation&#xD;
      (rTMS) is an emerging treatment for medically refractory major depressive disorder (MDD).&#xD;
      rTMS involves direct stimulation of cortical neurons using externally applied, powerful,&#xD;
      focused magnetic field pulses. Dozens of studies and several meta-analyses over the last 15&#xD;
      years have shown that rTMS of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) produces&#xD;
      statistically significant improvements in MDD, even when medications have failed. In the most&#xD;
      recent generation of randomized controlled trials, rTMS consistently achieves response rates&#xD;
      of 50-55% and remission rates of 30-35% in medically refractory MDD patients. However, the&#xD;
      vast majority of studies have focused on its used in outpatient samples. Furthermore, the few&#xD;
      studies that have investigated its used in inpatient samples have demonstrated similar&#xD;
      efficacy rates than medications using the conventional 10 Hz rTMS protocol. No study, has&#xD;
      addressed the question whether rTMS can speed up the response rate, and shorten length of&#xD;
      stay in hospital, nor what are the biomarkers of treatment response to rTMS in inpatient&#xD;
      population. Conventional rTMS protocols, as used in the major trials in the USA that secured&#xD;
      FDA approval in 2008, applied 3000 pulses of unpatterned, 10 Hz stimulation administered over&#xD;
      37.5 minutes. These protocols limit the number of patients who can be treated with a single&#xD;
      machine to approximately 10 per day, thus perpetuating the high cost of treatment. In&#xD;
      contrast, iTBS has been shown to have induce neuroplasticity, effective in MDD, and only&#xD;
      requires 3 minutes to administer, making it a feasible option for multiple treatments per&#xD;
      day, particularly in inpatient populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, addressing the question of biomarkers in inpatient population suffering MDD and&#xD;
      whether improvement can be accomplished in only 3 weeks is a critical question with very&#xD;
      direct impact and translation to clinical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Response to an index course of accelerated Left-iTBS 3 treatments per day will be&#xD;
           associated with associated with increased activation of frontal regions in functional&#xD;
           Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) and electroencephalogram (EEG) (increase cerebral&#xD;
           blood flow to left DLPFC, and decrease in alpha power in left DLPFC), and decrease of&#xD;
           inflammatory biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Depression scores on Hamilton Depression Ration Scale (HDRS)-17 will decrease by at the&#xD;
           end of second week of treatment, in 50% of the sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate neurophysiological and inflammatory biomarkers in inpatients with&#xD;
           depression treated with accelerated rTMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To investigate the speed in reduction of symptoms to accelerated rTMS in MDD in&#xD;
           inpatient setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROCEDURES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The entire study will recruit a total of 50 inpatients. Patients meeting symptomatic criteria&#xD;
      for a depressive episode will receive Left-iTBS 3 treatments per day, 45 to 1 hour apart, for&#xD;
      a total of 20 consecutive days. Patients will undergo motor threshold testing to determine&#xD;
      the appropriate site and strength of stimulation according to standard methods then begin&#xD;
      treatment. Measure will also include electroencephalography (EEG), near infrared spectroscopy&#xD;
      (fNIRS), a blood draw, and cognitive testing, questionnaires. The treatment phase will last&#xD;
      20 days. Treatment will be administered daily in the morning (60 treatments total).&#xD;
