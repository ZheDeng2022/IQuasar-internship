  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The arthritis of temporomandibular joint is the most frequent degenerative disease of the jaw&#xD;
      joint. Several clinical studies recommend the recourse to the viscosupplement because of its&#xD;
      efficiency in the long term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present research has for objective to find clinical factors predictive of success or&#xD;
      failure of viscosupplementation in ATM such as clinical severity before injection, the&#xD;
      presence of a limited mouth opening or lenght of symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is an open observational monocentrical prospective study. The recruitment is competitive&#xD;
      and the study will be ended when 44 patients will have been included by taking into account a&#xD;
      risk of trial exits or of lost of sight of 10 %.The main criterion is the influence of the&#xD;
      radiological stage on the answer to the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of inclusion 6 months. Duration of follow-up 6 months. Total duration of the study&#xD;
      12 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Forty patients presenting an ATM asserted by radiography and justifying a viscosupplement,&#xD;
      without other selection criterion than the opinion of the investigator concerning the&#xD;
      legitimacy of a viscosupplement and the agreement of the patient participating in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data collected during the consultations at J0, J90 and J180 will be inputed by the&#xD;
      investigator in the paper version of the CRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The informations collected during the initial consultation (J0) are: demographic (sex, age,&#xD;
      weight, size), pathological (history of the disease, target side, previous treatments,&#xD;
      evaluation of pain at chewing and palpation (scale of Likert : 11 points), the inter-incisive&#xD;
      distance during the maximal opening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The informations collected during J90 and the final consultation (J180) are: the evaluation&#xD;
      of pain at chewing and palpation (scale of Likert 11 points), the perception by the patient&#xD;
      of the efficiency of the treatment (scale of Likert 4 points), patient satisfaction score,&#xD;
      variation of its consumption of analgesic or of AINS (scale of Likert 5 points).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A descriptive analysis will be performed to characterize the demographic data, the history of&#xD;
      the disease and its treatments, as well as the clinical and radiological data of the patients&#xD;
      in the date of the inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The response to the treatment (Yes/No) will be estimated by 3 complementary terms, and for&#xD;
      each one of them, the predictive response factors will be studied. Each patient will be&#xD;
      classified in one of the treatment response categories based on the patients efficacy&#xD;
      assessment, the pain decrease of at least 3 points or of at least 50% on the Likert scale,&#xD;
      the satisfaction level of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The coefficients of the multivariate models (ANCOVA and mixed model) will be considered as&#xD;
      significant if their p-value is inferior to the threshold of 5%.&#xD;
