  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-country, multicentre, observational cross-sectional one-visit study of&#xD;
      patients suffering from severe asthma in primary and secondary care settings in Europe&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to generate real-world data on the characteristics of patients considered to&#xD;
      have severe asthma in primary and secondary care settings that should be referred for&#xD;
      assessment for biologics. It is anticipated that these data from European countries, will&#xD;
      help to estimate the unmet need for better treatments in severe asthma patients and will&#xD;
      provide supporting evidence on the current shortcomings in referrals to asthma specialist or&#xD;
      secondary care clinics. This information could also support the development of better severe&#xD;
      asthma care pathways across Europe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 1,500 other patients like you will take part in the RECOGNISE study.&#xD;

             Long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA), leukotriene modifier, theophylline, or continuous or&#xD;
             near continuous OCS [i.e.,maintenance OCS for ≥50% of the previous year])(controlled&#xD;
             or uncontrolled). NB: High dose ICS defined according to GINA&#xD;

          -  Twelve months of documented baseline data in medical records or asked on study visit&#xD;
             day including asthma medication, especially oral corticosteroid (OCS) treatment and&#xD;
             history of asthma exacerbations (number and severity)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of one pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1)&#xD;
             in last 12 months or on study visit day&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other respiratory conditions including: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (as main&#xD;
             diagnosis), bronchiectasis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary hypertension,&#xD;
             alpha-1-antitrypsine-deficiency, and malignancy of any kind (NB: the following&#xD;
             conditions are permitted: nasal polyposis, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis,&#xD;
             non-idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent biologics for asthma except for stable allergen immunotherapy (defined as a&#xD;
             stable dose and regimen at the time of the study visit). Acceptable washout periods&#xD;
             for other asthma biologics:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Other eosinophil lowering products indicated for asthma (including mepolizumab or&#xD;
                  reslizumab): at least 4 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Prior omalizumab use: at least 1 month&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  An acute or chronic condition that, in the investigator's opinion, would limit the&#xD;
             patient's ability to complete questionnaires or participate in this study or impact&#xD;
             the interpretations of results&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is participating in an ongoing randomized clinical trial or participation in&#xD;
             an observational trial that might, in the investigator's opinion, influence the&#xD;
             assessment for the current study.&#xD;
