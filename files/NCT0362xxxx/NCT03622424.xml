      This study evaluates the effects of Gelesis200 on Appetite Parameters, Food Intake, and&#xD;
      Glycemic Control in Overweight or Obese Prediabetic Subjects: A Sub-Study of LIGHT-UP. Some&#xD;
      of the patients will receive Gelesis200, the other will receive a combination of Gelesis200&#xD;
      and placebo and the final group will receive just placebo.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Overweight (BMI ≥25 and &lt;30kg/M2) and obesity (BMI ≥30kg/M2) are major health problems,&#xD;
      world-wide. The overweight/obesity epidemic was first noted in the US and then spread to&#xD;
      other industrialized nations, and is now seen even in developing countries. The World Health&#xD;
      Organization (WHO) estimated that the worldwide prevalence of obesity has nearly doubled&#xD;
      between 1980 and 2008, and in a separate analysis, the NCD Risk Factor Collaboration (NCD&#xD;
      RisC) and the WHO estimated that the worldwide prevalence of diabetes has nearly quadrupled&#xD;
      between 1980 and 2014, from 108 million to 422 million, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intra-gastric balloon is an intervention designed to reduce stomach volume, but there are&#xD;
      conflicting data on sustained weight loss and no clear data indicating a decrease in&#xD;
      mortality. Side effects include balloon movement, nausea, vomiting, pain, and stomach&#xD;
      ulceration. The results from bariatric surgery suggest that limiting the functional volume of&#xD;
      the stomach is an effective modality for the treatment of obesity. However, because of the&#xD;
      invasive nature of the procedure, associated risk of peri-operative complications and the&#xD;
      relatively high cost, bariatric surgery is usually reserved for the severely obese subjects.&#xD;
      A need exists for a product that is easy to use, safe, convenient, more accessible, and&#xD;
      effective at inducing and sustaining weight loss. Interventions which act mechanically by&#xD;
      occupying stomach volume, increasing the elasticity and viscosity of the upper&#xD;
      gastrointestinal content, and extending gastric emptying time, could potentially be very&#xD;
      beneficial.A medical device which induces satiety and decreases hunger could result in&#xD;
      decreased caloric intake and weight loss. The advantage of such a medical device is that it&#xD;
      would not require drastic restriction of food choices and would circumvent the challenge of&#xD;
      unacceptable hunger levels which have derailed so many dietary interventions in the past.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gelesis200, when hydrated, is homogeneously mixed with the ingested food,increasing the&#xD;
      volume and elasticity of the stomach and small intestine contents. This in turn may induce&#xD;
      satiety,which reduces food intake. Previous studies with a similar hydrogel (Gelesis100) have&#xD;
      shown increased satiety,reduced body weight(especially in prediabetics), and improved&#xD;
      glycemic control. It is expected that Gelesis200 will have similar effects to Gelesis100.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the physical properties of Gelesis200 (viscosity), which are similar to some&#xD;
      dietary fibers, suggest that Gelesis200 will have a favorable impact on glycemic control.&#xD;
