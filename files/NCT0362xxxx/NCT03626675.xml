      Definitions Glaucoma represents a group of diseases defined by a characteristic optic&#xD;
      neuropathy that is consistent with excavation and undermining of the neural and connective&#xD;
      tissue elements of the optic disc and by the eventual development of distinctive patterns of&#xD;
      visual dysfunction .Pre-perimetric glaucoma is a term that is sometimes used to denote&#xD;
      glaucomatous changes in the optic disc in patients with normal visual fields.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glaucoma and cataract incidence increases with age. Special considerations are needed when&#xD;
      choosing which surgical strategy to undertake when either of these two conditions requires&#xD;
      surgical management. When performed prior to cataract surgery, trabeculectomy increases the&#xD;
      risk of cataract formation by up to 78%, while subsequent cataract surgery may increase the&#xD;
      risk of elevated intraocular pressure or trabeculectomy failure. By contrast, when cataract&#xD;
      surgery alone is performed in glaucoma patients; an early postoperative intraocular pressure&#xD;
      spike sometimes requiring medical treatment is commonly reported. Therefore,&#xD;
      phacotrabeculectomy, a procedure that combines the management of these two conditions&#xD;
      together in one surgery, may be considered in these situations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When to Consider Combined Surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combined cataract extraction and glaucoma surgery (trabeculectomy, glaucoma drainage implant&#xD;
      surgery, or any of the newer surgical approaches for glaucoma) should be carefully selected&#xD;
      and individualized depending on clinical findings in each case:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cataract surgery alone is sufficient for patients with well controlled in intraocular&#xD;
           pressure in the setting of early to moderate optic nerve damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with uncontrolled intraocular pressure in the presence of severe optic nerve&#xD;
           damage should receive glaucoma surgery first, followed by cataract extraction a few&#xD;
           months later&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Combined surgery may be best suited for a patient with a visually significant cataract&#xD;
           with uncontrolled glaucoma despite maximal medical therapy and/or laser trabeculoplasty.&#xD;
           Cost is often an issue for many patients and eliminating medications can help reduce the&#xD;
           financial burden. Poor compliance with glaucoma medications can also be an issue to&#xD;
           consider both procedures together.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The indication for phaco-trabeculectomy was the simultaneous presence of a visually&#xD;
      significant cataract and open angle glaucoma requiring medications, poor patient compliance,&#xD;
      advanced glaucomatous optic nerve damage or visual field loss, or medically uncontrolled&#xD;
      glaucoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effect of cataract surgery on anterior segment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cataract surgery and intraocular lens implantation lead to significant increases in anterior&#xD;
      chamber depth and anterior chamber angle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trabeculectomy lead to significant decrease in anterior chamber depth and anterior chamber&#xD;
      angle.The effects of trabeculectomy on anterior segment parameters measured by optical&#xD;
      biometry in Primary open-angle glaucoma and pseudoexfoliation glaucoma and found in primary&#xD;
      open angle glaucoma , intraocular pressure and anterior chamber depth decreased at the 1st&#xD;
      and 3rd months significantly. Conclusion: Trabeculectomy cause some differences in anterior&#xD;
      segment parameters in both primary open angle glaucoma and pseudoexfoliation cases and the&#xD;
      differences between these changes in both groups were found to be insignificant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anterior Segment - Optical Coherence Tomography is a useful tool to evaluate filtering blebs&#xD;
      or glaucoma drainage devices in the postoperative period. Clinically , blebs can be described&#xD;
      as diffuse, cystic, encapsulated, or flat. However, these descriptions are subjective and&#xD;
      there may be cases in which clinical appearance does not correlate with bleb function.&#xD;
      Therefore, visualizing intra bleb morphology with anterior segment imaging may enhance our&#xD;
      understanding of different surgical outcomes and wound healing. The noncontact anterior&#xD;
      Segment - Optical Coherence Tomography scanning provides a significant advantage over&#xD;
      ultrasound biomicroscopy in eliminating direct trauma to the bleb or reducing the risk of&#xD;
      potential infection that could occur with the use of an eye-cup or probe .In addition, the&#xD;
      higher scanning resolution of allows differentiating the subconjunctival fluid collection and&#xD;
      the supra sclera fluid space. The anterior segment - optical coherence tomography used to&#xD;
      describe intra- bleb morphology and structures, including bleb wall thickness,&#xD;
      subconjunctival fluid collections, supra sclera fluid space, sclera flap thickness, and&#xD;
      intra-bleb intensity. Anterior segment - optical coherence tomography allows visualization of&#xD;
      the glaucoma drainage devices in the anterior chamber to assess their position or potential&#xD;
      occlusion .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effect of phacotrabeculectomy on anterior chamber depth:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phacotrabeculectomy lead to increases in anterior chamber depth and anterior chamber angle.&#xD;
      Poon, Linda Yi-Chieh et al studied comparison of surgical outcomes after phacotrabeculectomy&#xD;
      in primary angle-closure glaucoma versus primary open-angle glaucoma found; the primary angle&#xD;
      closure glaucoma group had an anterior chamber depth that was significantly shallower than&#xD;
      the primary open-angle glaucoma group prior to surgery. However, after surgery, the mean&#xD;
      anterior chamber depth in the primary angle closure glaucoma group increased to a depth&#xD;
      similar to the primary open-angle glaucoma group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging of the anterior segment of the eye Imaging of the anterior segment of the eye offers&#xD;
      an objective method for visualizing the angle and adjacent anatomical structures. In addition&#xD;
      to qualitative analyses, some imaging modalities permit quantitative analyses that can be&#xD;
      used to monitor change or progression over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound Biomicroscopy uses high frequency ultrasound (35-100 MHz) to provide high&#xD;
      resolution images of the angle. Ultrasound Biomicroscopy has shown good agreement with&#xD;
      gonioscopy in assessing the anterior chamber angle. Although is a useful technology capable&#xD;
      of providing both qualitative and quantitative analyses, its major advantage lies in its&#xD;
      ability to visualize structures posterior to the iris to detect various causes of secondary&#xD;
      angle closure, such as plateau iris, ciliary effusions, or irido-ciliary masses. The&#xD;
      disadvantages of ultrasound biomicroscopy include required supine position, use of&#xD;
      anesthesia, need for a skilled examiner, longer image acquisition time, and contact with the&#xD;
      eye using a cup with a coupling medium or a probe that can lead to corneal abrasion or&#xD;
      potential infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anterior Segment Optical Coherence Tomography uses the principle of low-coherence&#xD;
      interferometry instead of ultrasound to produce, cross sectional, non-contact,&#xD;
      three-dimensional, high-resolution imaging modality of the anterior segment of the eye. The&#xD;
      technique measures the delay and intensity of the light reflected from the tissue structure&#xD;
      being analyzed and compares it with the light reflected by a reference mirror. The&#xD;
      combination of these two signals results in interference phenomenon. The signal intensity&#xD;
      depends on the optical properties of the tissues, and the device uses these signals to&#xD;
      construct a sagittal cross-section image of the structure being analyzed. OCT technology was&#xD;
      initially used to produce images of the posterior segment of the eye by using a wavelength of&#xD;
      820nm. In 2001, the wavelength was altered to 1310nm to allow better penetration through&#xD;
      light retaining tissues such as the sclera and limbus and to improve visualization of the&#xD;
      anterior segment. Compared with ultrasound biomicroscopy , this technology provides a higher&#xD;
      axial resolution and faster sampling rate (2.0 kHz versus 0.8 kHz). Another main clinical&#xD;
      advantage over ultrasound biomicroscopy is its ability to provide non contact scanning in a&#xD;
      seated, upright position..The major drawback for anterior segment optical coherence&#xD;
      tomography is its inability to visualize structures posterior to the iris due to blockage of&#xD;
      wavelength by pigment. This limits its application in screening several secondary causes of&#xD;
      angle closure, such as plateau iris, ciliary body cyst or tumor, lens subluxation, or ciliary&#xD;
      effusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biometric parameters which can be measured with the anterior segment optical coherence&#xD;
      tomography:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Iris thickness ,iris cross- sectional area ,iris curvature ,AC depth ,AC width ,angle opening&#xD;
      distance , angle recess area , scleral thickness, trabecular meshwork ciliary process&#xD;
      distance ,trabecular iris angle , lens vault.&#xD;
