      Introduction Intrabony defects occur frequently in periodontitis and represent sites that, if&#xD;
      left untreated, are at increased risk for disease progression. Although resective or repair&#xD;
      procedures have been used to treat intrabony defects, aiming at their elimination, the&#xD;
      treatment of choice is surgical periodontal regeneration. Over the last 30 years,&#xD;
      histological and clinical studies have greatly improved our knowledge regarding regeneration&#xD;
      of the periodontium and much attention has been given in clinical practice on the utilization&#xD;
      of the principle of guided tissue regeneration (GTR), bone replacement grafts, biologics or&#xD;
      their combination. Biologic factors appear attractive to alleviate local ⁄systemic factors&#xD;
      counteracting periodontal wound healing ⁄ regeneration and untoward effects of biomaterials&#xD;
      and devices as they become key components of novel regenerative technologies. The material&#xD;
      most extensively researched as of today is enamel matrix derivative (EMD), which was first&#xD;
      introduced in 1997.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Development of periodontal regeneration in the last 30 years has followed two distinctive,&#xD;
      though totally different paths. The interest of researchers has so far focused on&#xD;
      regenerative materials and products, on one side, and, on novel surgical approaches on the&#xD;
      other side. In the area of materials and products, three different regenerative concepts have&#xD;
      been mainly explored namely, barrier membranes, bone grafts, and wound healing modifiers,&#xD;
      plus many combinations of the aforementioned. In the area of the surgical approaches,&#xD;
      clinical innovation in flap design and handling as well as minimally invasive approaches has&#xD;
      radically changed regenerative surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 1995, Harrel et al. introduced the first technical proposal of minimally invasive&#xD;
      periodontal regenerative surgery (MIS) of isolated intrabony defects, with the aim to reduce&#xD;
      surgical trauma, increase post-operative clot stability, improve flap adaptation and decrease&#xD;
      time of surgery. Utilization of micro- surgical instruments and magnification was also&#xD;
      proposed to minimize the trauma of the surgical procedure. The combination of this minimally&#xD;
      invasive technique with EMD was also suggested by the same authors with successful long- term&#xD;
      results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cortelini and Tonetti in 2007 presented a modification of the MIS technique. The authors&#xD;
      proposed access of the defect- associated interdental papilla either with the modified&#xD;
      papilla preservation technique- MPPT or the simplified papilla preservation technique- SPPT,&#xD;
      depending on the width of the interdental space in combination with the application of EMD&#xD;
      (MIST). Two years later, the same authors suggested a more tissue conservative technique, the&#xD;
      modified- MIST (M-MIST). The surgical approach of M- MIST consists of a tiny intrasulcular&#xD;
      incision performed only on the buccal side of the defect- associated tooth, which is&#xD;
      connected with a horizontal incision performed as close as possible to the papilla tip. The&#xD;
      palatal/lingual papilla are left untouched. In addition, Trombelli et al. suggested the&#xD;
      single flap approach (SFA) in which a small incision is also performed only either buccally&#xD;
      or palatially/lingually of the defect. Several randomized clinical trials published&#xD;
      thereafter, comparing the efficacy of these minimally invasive techniques with or without the&#xD;
      addition of regenerative factors, revealed equal results for both approaches, raising a&#xD;
      series of hypotheses that focus more on the intrinsic healing potential of a wound when ideal&#xD;
      conditions are provided with the surgical approach rather than the additive effect of&#xD;
      regenerated material. Regenerative factors may increase the clot's initial stability and lead&#xD;
      to better clinical results without though statistical significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More recently, a minimally invasive non- surgical technique (MINST) for treatment of&#xD;
      intrabony defects was proposed. Initial clinical trials indicated comparable results to the&#xD;
      surgical minimally invasive techniques in both clinical and microbiological outcomes.&#xD;
      Considerable clinical and radiographic improvements after the application of MINST were also&#xD;
      reported in a retrospective study, supporting its efficacy for treatment of intrabony&#xD;
      defects. Additionally, an investigation designed to compare the effectiveness of EMD in&#xD;
      combination with the MINST or MIST procedure in periodontal regeneration of deep intrabony&#xD;
      defects concluded that the flapless procedure may be successfully applied in deep intrabony&#xD;
      defects reaching clinical outcomes comparable with those of minimally invasive surgical&#xD;
      approaches. So far, investigations comparing the outcomes of MINST as monotherapy or in&#xD;
      combination with the use of EMD are missing. Thus, the purpose of this research is to compare&#xD;
      the effectiveness of MINST with or without application of EMD in the treatment of intrabony&#xD;
      defects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this prospective, randomized, parallel arm, blind, controlled clinical trial is to&#xD;
      compare the clinical and radiographic outcomes following regenerative treatment of intrabony&#xD;
      periodontal defects using a Minimally Invasive Non-Surgical Technique (MINST) with or without&#xD;
      the application of Enamel Matrix Derivative (EMD)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that the adjunctive application of EMD will enhance the clinical and&#xD;
      radiographic results of minimally invasive non- surgical treatment of intrabony defects.&#xD;
      Radiographic bone fill will be the primary outcome of the research, whereas CAL gain and PD&#xD;
      reduction will constitute the secondary outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure Before initiation of the study, the protocol will be approved by the Ethics&#xD;
      Committee of the Dental School of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. In addition,&#xD;
      informed consent will be signed by all participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to inclusion in the study, an initial examination will be performed, including medical&#xD;
      history, full- mouth plaque and bleeding scores, and PDs and CALs at 6 points on each tooth.&#xD;
      In addition, oral hygiene instructions and motivation will be given. Patients will receive a&#xD;
      supragingival debridement with ultrasonic instruments, in one session, without local&#xD;
      anesthesia. Two weeks later a re-evaluation visit will be performed, including full- mouth&#xD;
      plaque and bleeding scores and re-motivation to maintain proper oral hygiene. Four weeks&#xD;
      after the initial visit (2 weeks after the first reassessment), the re- evaluation visit will&#xD;
      be repeated. If the patient maintains appropriate oral hygiene levels (FMPS, FMBS &lt;20%)&#xD;
      he/she will be included in the study. If the bleeding and plaque scores are &gt; 20%, a third&#xD;
      re-evaluation visit will take place 2 weeks later (6 weeks after the initial visit) and if&#xD;
      the scores reach the desired level, the patient will be included in the study. A software&#xD;
      (www.randomizer.org) will be used by one of the investigators who will not participate in the&#xD;
      clinical and radiographic measurements nor the therapeutic intervention, to generate a block&#xD;
      randomization. Thus, participants will be randomized in one of the two groups in a way that&#xD;
      there is no difference between the two groups regarding the initial depth of the intrabony&#xD;
      defect. In patients with more than one intrabony defects meeting the inclusion criteria, a&#xD;
      second randomization scheme with the same software will take place, to determine which will&#xD;
      be included. The randomization results will be placed in sealed envelopes accessible only to&#xD;
      the principal investigator and opened for each patient after the end of MINST to determine if&#xD;
      EMD will be applied or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group A: application of minimally invasive non-surgical technique (MINST) for the&#xD;
           intrabony defect and conventional non- surgical periodontal treatment in the rest of the&#xD;
           quadrant teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group B: application of minimally invasive non- surgical technique (MINST) with&#xD;
           additional use of Enamel Matrix Derivative (EMD) for the intrabony defect and&#xD;
           conventional non- surgical periodontal treatment in the rest of the quadrant teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Procedures Group A: Minimally invasive non-surgical treatment (MINST). Root&#xD;
      instrumentation under local anesthesia using specific hand instruments (micro- curettes) and&#xD;
      piezon ultrasonic instruments in the area of intraosseous defect and scaling and root planing&#xD;
      using conventional ultrasonic tips and hand instruments in the rest of the quadrant teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B: Minimally invasive non-surgical treatment with application of enamel matrix&#xD;
      derivative. Root instrumentation under local anesthesia using micro- curettes and piezon&#xD;
      ultrasonic instruments in the area of intraosseous defect. Application of EDTA gel for 2&#xD;
      minutes on the root surface of the involved tooth. Rinsing with saline, drying and&#xD;
      application of EMD to fill the defect. Scaling and root planing with conventional ultrasonic&#xD;
      tips and hand instruments in the rest of the quadrant teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment in the remaining quadrants will proceed as following: the quadrant of the intrabony&#xD;
      defect as well as the quadrant that will be in the same side of the mouth (either left or&#xD;
      right) will be treated the same day with the MINST therapy. Both quadrants of the&#xD;
      contralateral side will be treated in another day within the same week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment procedures will be performed with the use of 3.0 magnification and fiber optic&#xD;
      lighting in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the treatment procedure, patients will be given instructions for use of a soft&#xD;
      toothbrush without the additional use of interdental cleaning and use of 0.12% chlorhexidine&#xD;
      solution (2 times a day) for 2 weeks. Two weeks after therapy, interdental cleaning will&#xD;
      start with the adjunctive use of chlorhexidine gel 0.2% once a day for the first two weeks&#xD;
      and 3 times a week for the rest of the study. Re-evaluation at 2 and 4 weeks, and 2, 3, 6,&#xD;
      and 12 months will be scheduled. During these appointments FMPS and FMBS will be evaluated,&#xD;
      oral hygiene instructions will be given and supragingival debridement will be performed when&#xD;
      indicated. Clinical and radiographic measurements will be recorded at the 6th and 12th month&#xD;
      examination.&#xD;

    <description>Enamel matrix derivative (EMD) has been widely used in the surgical treatment of periodontal intrabony defects, using a minimally invasive surgical technique (MINST). Recent studies have suggested that this product could also be used in the non-surgical treatment of intrabony defects using a minimally invasive technique with very good results. This study will evaluate the effect of enamel matrix derivative in the non-surgical treatment of periodontal intrabony defects when a minimally invasive technique is used. Besides clinical measurements, radiographic analysis will also be performed to evaluate the treatment results.</description>
