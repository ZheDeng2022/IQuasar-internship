  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether an infusion of lidocaine during surgery can&#xD;
      reduce the need for postoperative opioid pain medication use in patients undergoing lumbar&#xD;
      spine surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited by spine surgeons from their pool of patients who are&#xD;
      presenting for surgery at University of Vermont Medical Center. If they agree to participate,&#xD;
      patients will be assigned at random to receive either an infusion of lidocaine during&#xD;
      surgery, or an infusion of saline with 5% dextrose. Subjects will also be asked to complete a&#xD;
      15-item questionnaire that asks about health, quality of life, and level of pain, at three&#xD;
      timepoints. Patients will also be asked to rate their level of pain at multiple timepoints&#xD;
      after surgery, and we will collect the additionally data from patients' medical records.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lidocaine has analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects. It has been shown to reduce early&#xD;
      postoperative pain and nausea. Additionally, lidocaine has been shown to have positive&#xD;
      effects in the recovery of bowel function, with a reduction in time to first flatus, first&#xD;
      bowel sounds, first bowel movement, and is associated with a reduction of ileus. Because of&#xD;
      these facts, lidocaine infusion has become part of enhanced recovery pathways after bowel&#xD;
      surgery at our institution and others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are few trials examining the use of lidocaine for orthopedic procedures and many of&#xD;
      these studies have contradictory adults. An article by Martin et al. found no benefit in pain&#xD;
      or recovery after total hip arthroplasty. By contrast, Farag and colleagues found that&#xD;
      lidocaine significantly improves postoperative pain after major spine surgery. Additionally,&#xD;
      quality of life scores at one and three months after surgery were significantly higher in the&#xD;
      lidocaine group. When our Spine Surgery Analgesic Protocol for major spine surgery at&#xD;
      University of Vermont Medical Center was revised in 2015, a lidocaine infusion was added to&#xD;
      the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies for lidocaine use in minor lumbar surgery are scant. In one study of 50 patients in&#xD;
      Korea, patient pain scores and fentanyl consumption were significantly lower in the lidocaine&#xD;
      infusion group (1.5 mg/kg bolus plus 2 mg/kg/hr infusion) at 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 hours after&#xD;
      surgery. Of note, the Cleveland Clinic Outcomes group is currently enrolling 440 patients in&#xD;
      a study in which half will receive lidocaine and ketamine infusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A reduction in opioid use may lead to the potential reduction of opioid-related side effects,&#xD;
      such as nausea, constipation, and hyperalgesia, as well as more serious consequences such as&#xD;
      respiratory depression and abuse. There is also the possibility of a length of stay reduction&#xD;
      which has potential financial benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized, controlled, double-blind study involving patients undergoing one- or&#xD;
      two-level posterior lumbar instrumented spinal fusion with or without decompression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The University of Vermont Medical Center operating rooms will be utilized for this&#xD;
      investigation. For the study group, we plan to prospectively recruit 140 patients 18-75 years&#xD;
      of age. Recruitment will be done by the participating orthopedists and neurosurgeons, from&#xD;
      their own patients. After an informed consent discussion, patients will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      to receive 1 mg/kg lidocaine bolus and intraoperative infusion of 2 mg/min (intervention arm)&#xD;
      or no lidocaine (control arm). All patients will receive adequate pain control medication&#xD;
      according to their needs. Subjects will complete the 15-question Quality of Recovery&#xD;
      assessment at baseline and at 36 and 60 hours after surgery. Using the electronic medical&#xD;
      system, the following information with extracted: Total morphine equivalent used in house at&#xD;
      36 hours, total morphine equivalents used at 60 hours, visual analog scale pain scores at 4,&#xD;
      8, 12, 24, 36, and 60 hours, length of stay, incidence of nausea requiring medication, time&#xD;
      to first flatus, and time to first bowel movement. Subjects will receive a patient-controlled&#xD;
      analgesia pump for the first 36 hours after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be performed by the University of Vermont Medical Center Investigational&#xD;
      Pharmacy Drug Service (IDS). IDS will generate a table of random numbers and assign those&#xD;
      numbers in a 1:1 ratio of active drug to placebo, in blocks of 4. Following informed consent,&#xD;
      a member of the study team will notify IDS, which will prepare syringes for the bolus dose&#xD;
      and a bag for the infusion, both containing either active drug or placebo. The syringes and&#xD;
      bag will be labeled with the subject's name, medical record number, and randomization number.&#xD;
