      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common childhood cancer. It occurs when a bone&#xD;
      marrow cell develops errors in its DNA. Certain tests are used to help detect the disease.&#xD;
      But the results of these tests often disagree. Researchers want to review the results of&#xD;
      tests of bone marrow and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from people with ALL. They want to try to&#xD;
      find the best ways to detect the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare results of certain bone marrow and CSF tests for detecting ALL, in order to see&#xD;
      how much and how often the results disagreed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children and young adults with ALL or lymphoblastic lymphoma who were enrolled in certain&#xD;
      previous studies and consented for their data to be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will review participants medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will collect data like the participant s gender, age, and when their tests were done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will also collect results from tests like:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone marrow tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Flow cytometry tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging&#xD;
&#xD;
      CSF cell count&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of the stored data will be labeled by a code that only the study team at the research&#xD;
      site can link to the participant. Data will be stored in password protected computers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Minimal residual disease detection in the bone marrow is highly prognostic for disease&#xD;
      relapse in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and is determined based on a&#xD;
      single bone marrow aspirate sample. Our anecdotal experience over the past decade in the&#xD;
      Pediatric Oncology Branch (POB) has led us to believe that a bone marrow aspirate as the only&#xD;
      metric for disease detection may not be adequate, but a systematic review detailing our&#xD;
      experience and reporting on instances where we have identified discrepancies in disease&#xD;
      status has not been performed to confirm our hypothesis. Additionally, patients with ALL also&#xD;
      may have CNS involvement by disease. Current standard of care assessment of disease in the&#xD;
      central nervous system (CNS) consists of cerebrospinal (CSF) fluid sampling and evaluation&#xD;
      for blasts by cytology only, which may not identify occult levels of CNS disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Flow cytometry-based CSF testing is highly dependent on the media used for CNS specimens and&#xD;
      the expertise of the center performing these studies. NCI Flow cytometry has established&#xD;
      expertise in CNS disease evaluation. In evaluation of patients with ALL for POB treatment&#xD;
      protocols, we have observed cases where there is a discrepancy between cytopathology and flow&#xD;
      cytometry results. Recent literature in ALL indicates that subclinical CNS disease may be&#xD;
      relevant to patient outcomes. With a primary goal of identifying the optimal methods for&#xD;
      disease detection in ALL, this protocol is a retrospective chart review of bone marrow&#xD;
      evaluations and cerebrospinal fluid results in patients with ALL or lymphoblastic lymphoma&#xD;
      (LBL) who underwent treatment or evaluation in the Pediatric Oncology Branch of the National&#xD;
      Cancer Institute. This study will not involve the use of specimens or participant contact.&#xD;
      All data that is needed has already been collected and is available in CRIS records. Data&#xD;
      will only be collected on patients with ALL or LBL where routine PET scans to follow EM&#xD;
      disease, bone marrow and/or CSF evaluations were done as standard of care or on study and&#xD;
      will largely be from trials where Dr. Nirali Shah is or has served as the PI (e.g.,&#xD;
      12-C-0112, 15-C-0029.)&#xD;
