      The goal of this study is to transfer the surgical implantation technique and evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and effectiveness of the RETINA IMPLANT Alpha AMS to restore limited visual function&#xD;
      and functional vision in blind Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) patients who are at the Light&#xD;
      Perception (LP) or No Light Perception vision level (NLP). The safety of the implantation&#xD;
      procedure and the long-term presence of the RETINA IMPLANT Alpha AMS will be assessed with&#xD;
      clinical exams and objective clinical tests for the absence of any new permanent damage to&#xD;
      the structure and function of the implanted eye with no permanent injury to the health and/or&#xD;
      well being of the implanted patient as a result of the surgical procedure or presence of the&#xD;
      implant. The effectiveness of the RETINA IMPLANT Alpha AMS will be evaluated by measuring&#xD;
      limited visual function and functional vision in implanted subjects with the device &quot;ON&quot; and&#xD;
      &quot;OFF&quot; in a randomized order. The ability to restore limited vision in blind RP patients with&#xD;
      LP vision or NLP will reduce their disability and morbidity and provide a viable option to&#xD;
      combat their disease and improve their lives.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) is a rare genetic disorder albeit the most common cause of&#xD;
      inherited blindness. With progressive loss of function and cells in the outer retina,&#xD;
      individuals with RP can progress to complete blindness of Light Perception or No Light&#xD;
      Perception. There is no known cure or treatment for RP individuals at the Light Perception or&#xD;
      No Light Perception phase of this progressive degenerative disease. The RETINA IMPLANT Alpha&#xD;
      AMS is an investigational device designed to restore limited visual function and functional&#xD;
      vision in this subset of patients suffering with RP whose visual acuity has deteriorated to&#xD;
      the level of Light Perception or No Light Perception.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RETINA IMPLANT Alpha AMS has been designed to replace the non-functioning and absent&#xD;
      photoreceptor cells with a functional device to stimulate the remaining components of the&#xD;
      retina to restore limited visual function and functional vision in patients with RP. The&#xD;
      RETINA IMPLANT Alpha AMS device is surgically implanted subretinally to replace the&#xD;
      non-functioning pathologic photoreceptor/RPE layer (or absent photoreceptor cells and&#xD;
      defective pigment epithelium). The focusing lens system of the eye directs the visual image&#xD;
      onto the device. When turned &quot;ON&quot; the device then stimulates the remaining visual cells of&#xD;
      the inner layers of the retina and this visual information is subsequently transmitted by the&#xD;
      remaining retinal network via the optic nerve to the visual cortex in the Central Nervous&#xD;
      System (CNS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This investigation is an Early Feasibility Study and will seek to implant five (5) to eight&#xD;
      (8) patients. One surgical team, highly experienced in similar vitreoretinal procedures will&#xD;
      be trained and will implant the enrolled patients. Follow-up visits for each patient will&#xD;
      include an evaluation of safety and effectiveness at various time periods with follow-up&#xD;
      continuing through five (5) years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of masking in this clinical trial will be employed at the level of implanted subjects&#xD;
      undergoing effectiveness evaluations during the follow-up visits as further described.&#xD;
      Implant &quot;ON&quot; and &quot;OFF&quot; modality will be randomized and unknown to each subject undergoing&#xD;
      functional vision tests during the follow-up visit. The &quot;ON&quot; and &quot;OFF&quot; will be encoded as&#xD;
      either mode-1 or mode-2; for each test run, mode-1 and mode-2 will be differently encoded.&#xD;
      The subject's visual performance will be evaluated and recorded for both &quot;ON&quot; and &quot;OFF&quot;&#xD;
      implant conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each potential subject will undergo screening and evaluation to document that the eligibility&#xD;
      criteria have been met and for proper surgical planning for implantation of the RETINA&#xD;
      IMPLANT Alpha AMS. Qualifying subjects will undergo surgical implantation of the RETINA&#xD;
      IMPLANT Alpha AMS in one eye and will be followed immediately in the post-operative period.&#xD;
      Follow-up will continue for five (5) years.&#xD;
