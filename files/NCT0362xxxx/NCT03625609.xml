  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The WHO defines sexual health as a state of physical, emotional, mental and social&#xD;
      well-being, related to sexuality, not only the absence of illness, dysfunction or disability.&#xD;
      To acquire and maintain adequate sexual health, the sexual rights of all people must be&#xD;
      respected, protected and fully exercised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) present difficulties in the development of social&#xD;
      interaction skills, among other problems that directly affect their sexual health. The&#xD;
      consolidated prejudices and social myths related to the sexual affectivity of people with&#xD;
      ASD, and in general to people with intellectual diversity, have meant that they do not pay&#xD;
      any attention to the sexual health of this group in the assessment of their needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objectives: to understand the experience lived by young people with ASD and their&#xD;
      caregivers in relation to the affective needs during adolescence and to know the cognitive&#xD;
      and behavioral expression of the affective dimension of adolescents with ASD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mixed simultaneous design: qualitative based on the phenomenological paradigm, in order to&#xD;
      establish the perceived needs of young adults with ASD, their families and the professionals&#xD;
      who attend them, with the realization of focus groups and in-depth interviews. The second&#xD;
      quantitative part will be developed in adolescents (12-18 years) and their families,&#xD;
      evaluating the habitual behaviors and difficulties of Interaction in the affective&#xD;
      expression, by means of questionnaires and self-administered scales. It will be necessary to&#xD;
      sign the Informed Consent by all the participants, with the specific acceptance of the&#xD;
      project by the CEIC of the investigator's center.&#xD;

    <description>The measure utilized was developed specifically for this research - the Sexual Behaviour Scale (SBS; see Appendix) - and was based upon previous studies and the issues these studies identified (cf. Haracopos and Pedersen, 1992; Ruble and Dalrymple, 1993). The SBS examined parents' reports of their child's: (1) social behaviour; (2) privacy awareness; (3) sex education; and (4) sexual behaviour; as well as (5) parental concerns about outcomes for their child.</description>
