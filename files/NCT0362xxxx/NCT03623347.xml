  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      New approaches are needed for patients newly diagnosed with bulky glioblastoma (GB) and/or&#xD;
      with severe neurological impairment that cannot benefit from first line temozolomide&#xD;
      (TMZ)-basedn chemoradiotherapy. Bevacizumab (BEV), an antiangiogenic anti-VEGF-R monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody, has a rapid impact on tumor-related brain edema in recurrent GB. The present study&#xD;
      reports the feasibility and efficacy of an induction treatment with TMZ and BEV to alleviate&#xD;
      the initial neurological impairment and/or to reduce the tumor volume before a delayed&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapy.&#xD;

      the initial neurological impairment and/or to reduce the tumor volume before a delayed&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators retrospectively analyzed tumor and target volumes and clinical neurological&#xD;
      status in 39 patients with bulky GB and/or with severe neurological impairment after an&#xD;
      induction treatment combining TMZ and BEV. Neurological and radiological responses were&#xD;
      assessed according to RANO criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calculating gross tumor and clinical target volumes (GTV and CTV) was done at diagnosis and&#xD;
      before radiotherapy. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were&#xD;
      determined by Kaplan Meier methods. Safety was reported according to NCTCAE.&#xD;

    <description>The investigators reported here a series of patients in whom radiotherapy was considered as not feasible in first intention but most of which could be treated by optimal chemoradiotherapy after upfront TMZ and BEV treatment. The investigators analyzed the impact of this induction strategy on tumor and target volumes, neurological status and survival.</description>

        The investigators retrospectively collected clinical and radiological data from medical&#xD;
        files. Patients were over 18 years old. Most had histologically proven unresectable primary&#xD;
        GB. in some cases, GB diagnosis was only done by multimodal MRI with confirmation by a&#xD;
        collegial agreement including an expert in neuroradiology.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical criteria:- - age&gt; to 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  GBM de novo&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Histological evidence is essential. A minimum interval of 7 days is required&#xD;
                  between biopsy and neo-adjuvant therapy. A minimum interval of 15 days is&#xD;
                  required for open skull surgery and neo-adjuvant therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The insertion of patients is a WHO score 3 and 4 in relation to the neurological&#xD;
                  deficit is possible by definition&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  1. Patients without neurological deficit (SN 0) or with moderate deficit (SN 1 or SN&#xD;
             2).&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. In case of initial neurological deficit SN 3-4, the interest of a decompression&#xD;
             surgery must be discussed. If the surgery is unsuccessful, a corticosteroid test, at&#xD;
             least 4 days, with at least 1.5 mg / kg / day of prednisone equivalent, must be&#xD;
             performed. If surgery and / or corticosteroids allow to return to an SN 0-2&#xD;
             neurological score with return to an RPA III, IV or V class, the patient is not&#xD;
             included and must be treated according to a conventional chemoradiotherapy regimen&#xD;
             with temozolomide (Stupp schema).&#xD;
&#xD;

             angiologist. However, these treatments may be continued if their discontinuation is&#xD;
             considered harmful and that the participation in the trial is considered beneficial&#xD;
