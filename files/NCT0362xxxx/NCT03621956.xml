      3 clinical sites enrolling in the primary MINVI trial (NCT# ) will collect Near Infrared&#xD;
      Spectroscopy (NIRS) data in the first 10 minutes of life on a subset of 200 non-vigorous term&#xD;
      and near-term infants enrolled in the trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Caregivers and researchers raised theoretical concerns that the UCM technique may&#xD;
      deliver blood rapidly toward a non-vigorous newborn predisposing them to higher rates of&#xD;
      brain injury or dislodging cellular debris into the brain. However, of the 13 studies on term&#xD;
      infants comparing UCM to ECC, none have reported adverse outcomes. Even in more fragile&#xD;
      preterm infants, no harm has been reported. All demonstrated improvements similar to DCC with&#xD;
      increased red cell mass (measured by hematocrit or hemoglobin) improved blood pressure,&#xD;
      increased pulmonary blood flow and improved ferritin at 6 weeks to 6 months of age with UCM.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, careful assessment of safety is essential. Immediate physiological measurements&#xD;
      on a subset (n=200) of infants of the two sub-study sites where the use of NIRS is standard&#xD;
      of care, University of Alberta and SMBHWN, to establish the safety and efficacy of UCM. This&#xD;
      aim will further test our hypotheses that infants in the UCM group will have improved early&#xD;
      cardiac and cerebral hemodynamics within the first 10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a technology that allows non-invasive continuous&#xD;
      real-time measurement of the regional tissue oxygen saturation (StO2) of organs such as the&#xD;
      brain. There are well-established reference cerebral StO2 values for uncomplicated term and&#xD;
      preterm deliveries; however, there are no completed RCTs using NIRS in the delivery room. Our&#xD;
      group is currently leading the first multicenter trial (1R01HD088646-01A1) comparing DCC and&#xD;
      UCM measuring NIRS at birth in premature infants. If cerebral oxygenation is improved, it&#xD;
      will provide one plausible explanation for the long-term benefits expected with UCM. While&#xD;
      published data exists on cerebral oxygenation directly comparing UCM with DCC, some studies&#xD;
      demonstrated increases in cerebral oxygenation at 4 hours of age with DCC, and a decrease in&#xD;
      cerebral oxygenation at birth with DCC compared to immediate cord clamping. To our knowledge,&#xD;
      no studies using cerebral oxygenation in non-vigorous term/near-term infants have ever been&#xD;
      performed. This sub-study (n=200) will yield the largest available sample of specific&#xD;
      measurements of cerebral oximetry in non-vigorous term newborns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Substudy Sites: Three sites experienced with NIRS (University of Alberta, Sharp Grossmont&#xD;
      Hospital and SMBHWN) will obtain and report the physiological changes with UCM and ECC at 10&#xD;
      minutes of life. Data from the non-invasive monitoring devices are recorded using a&#xD;
      continuous real-time data acquisition system that provides a second-by-second record of the&#xD;
      resuscitation that is also time-linked to the video recordings. Both sites have 24/7 research&#xD;
      team coverage that attend all high-risk deliveries. The research team will ensure accurate&#xD;
      sensor placement and data collection. These two exceptional settings will allow us to collect&#xD;
      significant data regarding resuscitation outcomes linked to cerebral oxygenation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol for NIRS Sub-Study: At the two sub-study sites, the use of NIRS is standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of the NIRS sub-study, sites will collect physiological and resuscitation data from&#xD;
      birth (mean airway pressure, fractional oxygen) in addition to cerebral oxygenation. Once the&#xD;
      newborn is delivered, receives the intervention (UCM or ECC), and is stabilized during&#xD;
      resuscitation, a NIRS sensor (Fore-Sight, CAS Medical, Branford, CT) will be placed on the&#xD;
      right forehead within 10 minutes of the newborn being placed on the warmer. While arterial&#xD;
      saturation and heart rate data will be available to the clinical team, data from NIRS will be&#xD;
      blinded. Data on all study infants will be recorded for the first 10 minutes in the delivery&#xD;
      room at the two sites. Heart rate, oxygen saturations, and cerebral oxygenation will be&#xD;
      downloaded as per both site's practice for neonatal resuscitation.&#xD;
