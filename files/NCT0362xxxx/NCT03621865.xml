  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rhizome of Curcuma longa (turmeric) is commonly used as a spice and for its medicinal&#xD;
      properties traditionally in Asian countries. Turmeric extract usually contains 95%&#xD;
      curcuminoids with a specific ratio (approximately 75-80% curcumin, 15-20% demethoxycurcumin&#xD;
      (DMC), and 0-10% bisdemethoxycurcumin (BDMC)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Curcuminoids have higher solubility in organic solvents than in water. As a consequence,&#xD;
      curcuminoids have low aqueous solubility and poor gastrointestinal absorption. They also&#xD;
      exhibit rapid metabolism and systemic elimination and are therefore known to have limited&#xD;
      bioavailability, which limits the use of turmeric extract in general health care and as an&#xD;
      adjunct in managing various diseases. In order to improve the bioavailability of curcumin,&#xD;
      several approaches have been undertaken. The use of adjuvant like piperine that interferes&#xD;
      with glucuronidation; liposomal curcumin, nanoparticles, phospholipid complex; and structural&#xD;
      analogues of curcumin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, Naturex has developed a dried emulsion formulation using a turmeric extract mixed&#xD;
      together with a quillaja extract, sunflower oil and arabic gum. This formulation is highly&#xD;
      dispersible in water and should therefore improve the bioavailability of curcuminoids. The&#xD;
      aim of this study is to assess the bioavailability of curcuminoids and their metabolites&#xD;
      after oral intake of 4 turmeric extract-based formulations in comparison to a standard&#xD;
      unformulated turmeric extract.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The rhizome of Curcuma longa (turmeric) is commonly used as a spice and for its medicinal&#xD;
      proprieties traditionally in Asian countries. Turmeric has been studying in different&#xD;
      therapeutic areas. Antioxidant, anti-inflammatory (respiratory system, joints and digestive),&#xD;
      antimutagenic, antimicrobial, neurological disease, hepatoprotective and anticancer&#xD;
      properties are supported by in vitro and in vivo data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Curcumin has been studied as the main bioactive component of turmeric associated to its&#xD;
      potential health effect. However, besides curcumin, others components have been identified&#xD;
      (demethoxycurcumin DMC and bisdemethoxycurcumin BDMC); this group of coumpounds are named&#xD;
      together &quot;curcuminoids&quot;. Curcuminoids are natural yellow-orange pigments and hydrophobic&#xD;
      polyphenols derived from the rhizome of the herb Curcuma longa. They are commonly isolated&#xD;
      from the spice and food-coloring agent turmeric. Extracts of turmeric generally contain&#xD;
      75-80% curcumin, 15-20% DMC, and 0-10% BDMC. Regarding the intrinsic property, curcuminoids&#xD;
      have higher solubility in organic solvents than in water. As a consequence, curcuminoids have&#xD;
      low aqueous solubility and poor gastrointestinal absorption. They also exhibit rapid&#xD;
      metabolism and systemic elimination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This leads to the conclusion that curcuminoids from turmeric extract have low&#xD;
      bioavailability, which limits its use in general health care and as an adjunct in managing&#xD;
      various diseases. In order to improve the bioavailability of curcumin, several approaches&#xD;
      have been undertaken. The use of adjuvant like piperine that interferes with glucuronidation;&#xD;
      liposomal curcumin, nanoparticles, phospholipid complex; and structural analogues of&#xD;
      curcumin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, Naturex has developed a dried emulsion formulation using a turmeric extract mixed&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Dose-normalized AUC of total curcuminoids plasmatic concentration</measure>
    <time_frame>from 0 to 24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint is the dose-normalized AUC of total curcuminoids (sum of curcumin, DMC, BDMC and their metabolites) plasmatic concentration from 0 to 24 hours (AUC0-24h/dose) (expressed in µg.h/mL/mg). The dose-normalized AUC is the AUC normalized to curcuminoids intake by dividing the observed AUC by the corresponding curcuminoids dosage of each administration The following time-points are considered: T0, T15, T30, T45, T60, T90, T120, T240, T60, T480, T24H. T-10 will be considered as baseline value (T0) for AUC calculation. The primary comparison is Turmipure Gold 300 mg vs Standard turmeric 1500 mg powder extract.</description>
