      The purpose of this study is to determine if stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) on&#xD;
      non-consecutive days will increase the chances of curing non-small cell lung cancer when&#xD;
      compared to daily treatment.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to determine if treatment with stereotactic body radiotherapy&#xD;
      (SBRT) on non-consecutive days will improve the chance of curing non-small cell lung cancer&#xD;
      compared to treatment with SBRT on consecutive days. In either case, the dose of radiation is&#xD;
      the same. Non-consecutive treatments will be at least 40 hours apart and no more than 100&#xD;
      hours apart. The total course of treatment will be 8-12 days. Consecutive treatments will be&#xD;
      daily over 4-5 days within one calendar week. The total course of treatment will be 4-5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study team will assess if DNA from the tumor can be found in the blood to determine which&#xD;
      patients respond quickest to radiotherapy. These results will not be made available to&#xD;
      participants and will not change treatment.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ≥ 18 years of age (no upper age limit).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer, T1-2 N0 M0 either with histologic&#xD;
             confirmation or with documented interval growth of the index lesion on two interval&#xD;
             computed tomography (CT) chest scans and an SUVmax of the lesion ≥ 3.0 on a&#xD;
             pretreatment PET scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must be deemed medically inoperable or refuse surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Radiographic evaluation of the mediastinum and distant sites with a CT scan of the&#xD;
             chest and PET scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For T2b N0 patients, radiographic evaluation of the brain with magnetic resonance&#xD;
             imaging (MRI) of the brain unless the patient has contraindications to an MRI scan (in&#xD;
             which case a CT scan of the head is necessary).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For central T1 N0 and all T2 N0 patients, pathologic sampling (either via&#xD;
             endobronchial ultrasound-guided biopsy [EBUS] or mediastinoscopy) of mediastinal lymph&#xD;
             nodes is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG Performance Status 0-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For women of childbearing potential, negative pregnancy test within 2 weeks prior to&#xD;
             SBRT treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be deemed able to comply with the treatment plan and follow-up schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must provide specific informed consent prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential and male participants who are sexually active must use&#xD;
             adequate contraception during treatment and for 6 weeks following treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior history of radiation therapy to the thorax that would likely increase the risk&#xD;
             of serious complications from the radiotherapy delivered on this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior history of lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently taking disease-modifying rheumatoid drugs (DMRDs).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe, active co-morbidity, defined as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Acute bacterial or fungal infection requiring intravenous antibiotics at the time of&#xD;
             registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hepatic insufficiency resulting in clinical jaundice and/or coagulation defects. Note,&#xD;
             however, that coagulation parameters are not required for entry into this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior organ transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Systemic lupus.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Psoriatic arthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known to be HIV positive. HIV-positive patients are known to have worse clinical&#xD;
             outcomes, especially for local, regional, and distant cancer control. This poorer&#xD;
             prognosis is thought to be secondary to a compromised immune system.&#xD;
