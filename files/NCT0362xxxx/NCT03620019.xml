      This is a multicenter open-label, single-arm, phase II study designed to investigate the&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic and antitumor effects of denosumab alone and in combination with an anti-PD1&#xD;
      agent (pembrolizumab or nivolumab) in patients with unresectable PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor-naïve&#xD;
      regional and distant metastatic melanoma (AJCC stage III/IV). The pharmacodynamic and&#xD;
      antitumor effects will be investigated by performing translational research on peripheral&#xD;
      blood and tumor tissue collected before and during denosumab alone and in combination with&#xD;
      anti-PD-1 treatment.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Endpoints Co-primary Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The immune-mediated mechanism of action of denosumab alone will be evaluated in blood&#xD;
           and tumor samples collected at baseline and after third loading dose of denosumab.&#xD;
           Multiparameter flow cytometry and ELISA assays will be performed on peripheral&#xD;
           blood/serum samples as outlined above in section 1.10.1 Tumor biopsy samples will be&#xD;
           evaluated by IHC and IF studies as outlined above in section 1.10.2 (See referenced&#xD;
           sections for assay details. The investigators will estimate differences after 3 weeks of&#xD;
           denosumab treatment versus baseline).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The immune-mediated mechanism of action of denosumab combined with anti-PD-1 agent will&#xD;
           be evaluated in blood and tumor samples collected at weeks 16, 28 and 40 of the study.&#xD;
           Multi-parameter flow cytometry and ELISA assays will be performed on peripheral&#xD;
           blood/serum samples collected at weeks 16, 28 and 40 as outlined above in section&#xD;
           1.10.1. Tumor biopsy samples obtained at week 16 will be evaluated by IHC and IF studies&#xD;

           investigators will describe differences in immunomodulatory/antitumor effects observed&#xD;
           with denosumab therapy with later immunomodulatory/antitumor effects observed after the&#xD;
           addition of an anti PD-1 agent to denosumab).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AEs experienced by patients receiving denosumab-anti- PD-1 agent will be assessed per&#xD;
           NCI-CTCAE v.5.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The overall RR (CR + PR) at 16 weeks will assessed based on RECIST v1.1 criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Overall Survival (OS) rate at 1-year is defined as the time from day 1 of study&#xD;
           treatment until death as a result of any cause within one year of initiating study&#xD;
           treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Progression Free Survival (PFS) rate at 6 months is defined as the time from day 1 of&#xD;
           treatment until disease progression or death status measured 6 months after initiating&#xD;
           study treatment. Progression events will be defined per RECIST v1.1 criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in this trial will be given denosumab, 120 mg s.c. q4 weeks, starting on day 1 of&#xD;
      study treatment. Additional loading doses of Denosumab will be administered on day 8 and day&#xD;
      22 ( after Amendment 1). Nivolumab, 480 mg will be administered intravenously (IV) every 4&#xD;
      weeks and initiated 21 days after the first dose of Denosumab is given. In subjects enrolled&#xD;
      prior to Amendment 1 Pembrolizumab, 200 mg will be administered intravenously (IV) every 3&#xD;
      weeks and initiated 21 days after the first dose of denosumab is given. Combination therapy&#xD;
      with both agents will continue as long as subjects benefit from therapy for up to 1 year.&#xD;
      Study therapy will be discontinued for intolerable toxicity, disease progression or for other&#xD;
      reasons at the discretion of the investigator. If subjects are not withdrawn prematurely then&#xD;
      their last dose of study medications will be administered approximately 49 weeks after&#xD;
      denosumab was initiated.&#xD;

    <description>The antitumor effect of denosumab alone (i.e., after two loading doses of denosumab are given on day 1 and day 8) in patients with unresectable stage III or distant metastatic Programmed death-1 or Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) inhibitor-naïve cutaneous melanoma (stage III/IV) will be assessed by performing translational research on peripheral blood samples collected at baseline and on day 21 of the study. The hypothesis is that denosumab treatment will prevent destruction of autoreactive T cells within the thymus -and therefore will increase influx of those T cells into the blood, termed recent thymic emigrants (RTE). RTE will be measured by multiparameter flow cytometric analysis of cluster of differentiation (CD)8+ and CD 4+ RTE isolated from peripheral blood. Results will be expressed as the change in number of cells/microliter of peripheral blood between the baseline and the day 21 timepoints.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Signed written informed consent and HIPAA authorization for release of personal health&#xD;
             information.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Age ≥ 18 years at the time of consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0-2.&#xD;

          4. Histologically confirmed melanoma of cutaneous or mucosal primary; (e.g. sinus,&#xD;
             vagina, anus, gastrointestinal tract); metastatic melanomas from unknown primary are&#xD;
             allowed because melanoma of unknown primary is biologically similar to cutaneous&#xD;
             melanomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. AJCC stage III/IV unresectable (or resectable) disease. Both should be measurable by&#xD;
             RECIST v1.1 criteria. Patients with resectable bulky stage IIIB, state IIIC or stage&#xD;
             IIID melanoma (≥2-cm in shortest diameter for lymph nodes infiltrated by tumor and&#xD;
             ≥2-cm in longest diameter for non-lymph nodes infiltrated by tumor) can also be&#xD;
             entered into the study at the discretion of the Principal Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Must have available and consent to collect archived tumor blocks from previous&#xD;
             surgeries confirming or treating metastatic disease (e.g. radical lymph node&#xD;
             dissection); if not available or of insufficient quantity (e.g. &lt; 2-mm2 size tumor) or&#xD;
             quality (&gt; 50% necrosis, &lt; 30% tumor cells) they can be enrolled into the trial, if&#xD;
             they consent to have a tumor biopsy before treatment initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Must agree to undergo one on-treatment biopsy on week 4of the study; the biopsy at&#xD;
             week 16 is optional.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Must agree to have 100 mL blood drawn for study purposes on week 1 , day 20+or-2 (week&#xD;
             4), week 16, week 28, week 40 and end of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Demonstrate adequate organ function, as defined in the table; all screening labs to be&#xD;
             obtained within 21 days prior to registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 72&#xD;
             hours prior to study treatment. Note: Females are considered of child bearing&#xD;
             potential unless they are surgically sterile (have undergone a hysterectomy, bilateral&#xD;
             tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy) or they are naturally postmenopausal for at&#xD;
             least 12 consecutive months.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Females of childbearing potential must be willing to use adequate method of&#xD;
             contraception, as outlined in Section 4.5.2 - Oral contraception is required 14 days&#xD;
             prior to initiation of study medications until 120 days after treatment&#xD;
             discontinuation. Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the usual lifestyle and&#xD;
             preferred contraception for the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Male patients with female partners must have had a prior vasectomy or agree to use an&#xD;
             adequate method of contraception as outlined in Section 4.5.2 - Contraception,&#xD;
             starting with the first dose of study therapy through 120 days after the last dose of&#xD;
             study therapy. Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the usual lifestyle and&#xD;
             preferred contraception for the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. As determined by the enrolling physician or protocol designee, willingness and ability&#xD;
             of the subject to understand and comply with study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Previous radiation therapy is allowed, provided it is completed ≥14 days prior to&#xD;
             starting denosumab and patient has recovered adequately from any related toxicities&#xD;
             (grade≤1, or grade ≤2 that is stable for ≥3 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. If patient has received adjuvant treatments, in particular ipilimumab and high dose&#xD;
             interferon, any toxicities must have resolved to grade 1 or less. Grade 2 toxicities&#xD;
             attributed to ipilimumab from autoimmune endocrinopathies that require permanent&#xD;
             hormone replacement therapy are allowed as long as they are adequately treated. This&#xD;
             implies that patients should be off systemic steroids for treatment of any of these or&#xD;
             other autoimmune toxicities (e.g. colitis, rash).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects who have previously received PD-1 inhibitors in stage III (adjuvant) or stage IV&#xD;
        are allowed as long as:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. the interval between the last dose of the adjuvant PD-1 inhibitor and the date of&#xD;
             relapse (clinical or radiographic) is at least 1 year,&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. if subjects who received treatment for stage IV had antitumor response (partial&#xD;
             response or complete response) by RECIST criteria version 1.1 but they stopped due to&#xD;
             subject/investigator preference for at least a year between the last dose of the PD-1&#xD;
             inhibitor and the date of relapse (clinical or radiographic). Allowing for these&#xD;
             subjects who have previously received PD-1 inhibitors in the adjuvant setting (i.e. no&#xD;
             knowledge about clinical benefit) or following definite antitumor response in the&#xD;
             metastatic setting is based on a recent case series of subjects who responded to PD-1&#xD;
             inhibitor rechallenge, if they had previously responded to PD-1 inhibitors. This&#xD;
             implies that waning antitumor immunity in the absence (i.e. &gt;1 year) of costimulation&#xD;
             with PD-1 inhibitors may be the reason for cancer recurrence and NOT primary&#xD;
             resistance of PD-1 inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. any side effects that may have occurred during the previous exposure to PD-1&#xD;
             inhibitors are not serious (i.e. grade 1 or 2 by CTCAE version 5.0 criteria).&#xD;

             positive patients will be excluded].&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy. Note:&#xD;
             Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and&#xD;

             less than 0.9 x, lower limits normal. LLN) over the last 2 weeks since study&#xD;
             initiation that requires treatment beyond calcium and vitamin D supplementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Prior treatment with denosumab. Use of bisphosphonates for treatment of metastatic&#xD;
