    <description>Intracranial ORR is defined as the proportion of patients with either a complete response (CR) or a partial response (PR) in their intracranial disease based on two consecutive assessments ≥ 4 weeks apart. Disease status for this endpoint will be determined by an Independent Review Committee (IRC) in accordance with Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1) with modified measurability definition for intracranial lesions (≥ 0.5 cm by MRI) and allowing up to five intracranial target lesions. CR is defined as disappearance of all lesions. PR is defined as ≥30% decrease in tumor burden, in the absence of CR.</description>
