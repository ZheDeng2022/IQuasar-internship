      Pentoxifylline (PTX) is a medication that has been on the market since 1984 for use in&#xD;
      disease in the blood vessels of the legs. There is some preliminary information that it may&#xD;
      protect the kidneys from damage due to diabetes and other diseases. &quot;Pentoxifylline in&#xD;
      Diabetic Kidney Disease&quot; is a study to bee conducted in 40 VA hospitals across the nation to&#xD;
      determine definitively whether or not PTX can prevent worsening of kidney disease and delay&#xD;
      death in patients with diabetic kidney disease.&#xD;

      As a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, and after consultation with the appropriate&#xD;
      research oversight, regulatory and monitoring entities, screening and enrollment has been&#xD;
      placed on temporary administrative hold as of 03/17/2020. VA ORD has allowed sites to resume&#xD;
      after a detailed and thorough risk assess for each local VA was completed and sent to ORD for&#xD;
      approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a local site has been approved, the study sponsor will allow for resumption of research&#xD;
      activities once the local facility/study team deems prepared to being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some sites are on Administrative Hold from ORD due to COVID-19 until further notice while&#xD;
      others have begun.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the most frequent cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and&#xD;
      end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the U.S. and in U.S. Veterans. Control of blood pressure&#xD;
      and reduction in proteinuria, for instance by blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone&#xD;
      system (RAAS) with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin-receptors&#xD;
      blockers (ARBs), have led to some improvement in outcomes in recent years. However, many&#xD;
      patients continue to progress to ESRD, requiring costly dialysis or transplantation and&#xD;
      resulting in high mortality. Patients with ESRD on maintenance dialysis also have markedly&#xD;
      impaired quality of life. Thus, novel treatments are needed for this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The non-specific phosphodiesterase inhibitor pentoxifylline (PTX) was approved by the FDA in&#xD;
      1984 for the treatment of peripheral vascular disease. Therefore, this drug has been in&#xD;
      clinical use for over 3 decades and has been found to have an excellent safety profile.&#xD;
      Recent experimental and clinical data suggest that PTX, when added to usual care in patients&#xD;
      with DKD, leads to a reduction in albuminuria and reduced inflammation, as evidenced by lower&#xD;
      levels of inflammatory cytokines, and may decrease progression of renal disease. The&#xD;
      available evidence thus suggests the possibility of the use of PTX as a valuable repurposing&#xD;
      of an old drug in the treatment of DKD. However, a large scale multicenter randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial is needed to determine whether this agent can reduce hard endpoints such as&#xD;
      ESRD and death in patients with DKD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that PTX, when added to usual care,&#xD;
      leads to a reduction in the incidence of ESRD and mortality in type 2 diabetic patients with&#xD;
      DKD when compared to usual care plus placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint will be time to ESRD or death. ESRD will be defined as need for chronic&#xD;
      dialysis or renal transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary efficacy endpoints will be: (1) quality of life as measured by the Kidney Disease&#xD;
      Quality of Life Short Form (KDQoL-SF), (2) time until doubling of serum creatinine, (3)&#xD;
      hospitalization for congestive heart failure (CHF), (4) a three-point MACE (cardiovascular&#xD;
      death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke), (5) peripheral vascular disease&#xD;
      (PVD), (6) percentage of participants with 50% reduction in UACR from baseline, (7) Rate of&#xD;
      change in eGFR per year during the study period. Safety (serious adverse events and adverse&#xD;
      events possibly or probably related to study drug, discontinuation of study drug) will also&#xD;
      be analyzed as a secondary safety outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The design will be simple with only 3 face-to-face visits (randomization, titration and end&#xD;
      of trial visits). The remaining quarterly contacts can be conducted by telephone collecting&#xD;
      minimal targeted information. Laboratory testing specifically for the study will be done only&#xD;
      at randomization, at 6 months and the end of the study, if needed. However, coordinators will&#xD;
      assure that a serum creatinine will have been measured every 6 months as part of routine&#xD;
      clinical care or, in rare instances where one has not been done, obtain this measurement.&#xD;
      Other than randomization to PTX or matched placebo, patient care will be handled by usual&#xD;
      providers according to recommended standards of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a one-year ramp-up phase which will include 6 VA hospitals. The purpose of the&#xD;
      ramp-up phase will be to optimize procedures prior to widespread implementation, including&#xD;
      assessing the recruitment rate to determine whether the expected rate can be achieved and&#xD;
      assessing the efficacy of central distribution of study drug/placebo. In addition, the&#xD;
      investigators will refine methods of recruitment, demonstrate that the proposed follow-up&#xD;
      methods are working as intended, and address unforeseen problems. This will be followed by&#xD;
      the full study at 40 sites (which includes the 6 ramp-up sites) and will involve 3 years of&#xD;
      recruitment and 5 years of follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation, assuming a 26.6% event rate in the control group and 21.6% event&#xD;
      rate in PTX group (corresponding to a 19% relative reduction), two-sided alpha = 0.05, 85%&#xD;
      power, a 3-year enrollment period, a minimum 5-year follow-up period, and one proposed&#xD;
      interim analysis indicates that 2510 participants will need to be randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If this study is successful and PTX is found to reduce the incidence of ESRD and/or death,&#xD;
      this will reduce the personal and financial burden of renal replacement therapy&#xD;
      (dialysis/transplantation) for Veterans with diabetic kidney disease&#xD;
