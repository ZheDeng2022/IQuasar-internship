      Prospective, single-arm, non-sponsored, observational single centre trial in a cohort of&#xD;
      patients undergoing stress urinary incontinence surgery with ALTIS® procedure. All patients&#xD;
      were diagnosed according to clinical reports, physical exploration and urodynamics. Body mass&#xD;
      index(BMI) was categorized according to World Health Organization classification. Valsalva&#xD;
      leak point pressure was categorized in three groups &lt;60 cmH2O, 60-90 cmH2O and &gt;90 cmH2O).&#xD;
      Participants were evaluated post-operatively at 1, 6, 12 and 24 months with physical&#xD;
      examination, ICIQ-SF, visual scale of satisfaction(SVS)(0-10). Adverse events were reported&#xD;
      in each visit. Multivariate analysis for risk factors of surgery failure was performed.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single -arm, non-sponsored observational single centre trial in a&#xD;
      cohort of patients undergoing stress urinary incontinence surgery with ALTIS® procedure. Two&#xD;
      urologists, experts in female incontinence surgery, performed all procedures. Safety and&#xD;
      efficacy were evaluated. All participants provided written informed consent prior to&#xD;
      enrolment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators recruited female patients aged 35 years or more with urodynamically proven&#xD;
      stress urinary incontinence and who had failed to 6 months of non-surgical therapies&#xD;
      including behavioural changes and drug therapy. Exclusion criteria were pelvic infection,&#xD;
      pelvic organ prolapse ≥Stage 2, prior stress urinary incontinence surgery, neurogenic bladder&#xD;
      incontinence, previous pelvic radiotherapy, high post-voiding volume (100 mL in two times) or&#xD;
      being pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic variables (age, number of vaginal deliveries, prior stress urinary incontinence&#xD;
      surgery, menopause status, BMI and presence of urge incontinence) were collected. BMI was&#xD;
      categorized according to World Health Organization in normal (18,5-24,9 Kg/m2), overweight&#xD;
      (25-29,9 Kg/m2) and obese (≥ 30 Kg/m2) patients. For statistical purpose the investigators&#xD;
      divided patients into two groups, non-obese (18,5-29,9) Kg/m2) and obese (≥ 30 Kg/m2)&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative assessment included urogynecological history, cough test (stress test with at&#xD;
      least 300 mL of bladder volume measured by ultrasound), Spanish validated version of the&#xD;
      International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire sort form (ICIQ-SF) and urodynamic&#xD;
      test (Urodynamic parameters as Valsalva leak point pressure (VLPP), non-inhibited detrusor&#xD;
      contractions and post-voiding volume were reflected. VLPP was categorized into three groups&#xD;
      &lt;60 cmH2O, 60-90 cmH2O and &gt;90 cmH2O).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up was carried out with physical examination, ICIQ-SF, visual scale of satisfaction&#xD;
      and physical examination including cough test. Subjects were evaluated post-operatively at 1,&#xD;
      6, 12 and 24 months. Adverse events, such as vaginal erosion or pain related to the procedure&#xD;
      or the device were evaluated at each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary efficacy measures were objective cure, defined as negative cough test, and&#xD;
      subjective cure, defined as ICIQ-SF=0.&#xD;
