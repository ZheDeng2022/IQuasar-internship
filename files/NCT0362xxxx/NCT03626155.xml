      It is not clear if there is an optimal time for exercise to improve blood glucose profiles in&#xD;
      people with type 2 diabetes. The goal of this study is to compare post meal and 24-hour&#xD;
      glucose levels in 4 different conditions: i-seated control, ii-fasted state exercise, iii-30&#xD;
      minutes post meal exercise, and iv- 3-4-hour post meal exercise. The primary outcome of this&#xD;
      study is glucose control assessed over 24 hours using continuous glucose monitoring.&#xD;

      Purpose:To compare the effects of a single bout of walking conducted at different times of&#xD;
      the day on 24-hour glucose profiles in individuals with type 2 diabetes. In addition to a&#xD;
      control (no exercise) conditions, a bout of walking will be completed in the following 3&#xD;
      conditions i. in the fasted state, before breakfast, ii. 3-4 hours after lunch, and iii. 30&#xD;
      minutes after dinner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Recently, we developed the Exercise-Physical Activity and Diabetes Glucose&#xD;
      Monitoring (E-PAraDiGM), which was tested at 8 different sites across Canada&#xD;
      (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02834689). The original E-PAraDiGM protocol found no&#xD;
      significant difference in 24-hour glucose levels between the exercise and seated control&#xD;
      condition (publication in preparation). One the of the potential reasons for this could be&#xD;
      the timing of exercise in relation to meals. There is no clear consensus as to the optimal&#xD;
      time for exercise for individuals with type 2 diabetes. The goal of this study is to expand&#xD;
      on the original E-PAraDiGM study by adding fasted state exercise and 30 minute postprandial&#xD;
      exercise to the original 2 conditions (3-4 hours after lunch and seated control).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design: The complete protocol will take place over two separate 6-day periods for&#xD;
      each participant, which includes 50 minutes of exercise done in the following 4 conditions i.&#xD;
      in the fasted state, before breakfast, ii. 3-4hrs after lunch, iii. 30 minutes after dinner,&#xD;
      and iv. seated control. Each participant will complete each condition according to a&#xD;
      randomized, crossover design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Twelve individuals with T2D will be recruited at the University of Alberta.&#xD;
      Participants will be between the ages of 30-90 years and will have been diagnosed with T2D&#xD;
      for more than 6 months. They will also have no contraindications to exercise, no previous&#xD;
      myocardial infarction, strokes, or coronary artery disease. Participants will not be treated&#xD;
      with insulin or corticosteroids and they will have had no changes in diabetes medications in&#xD;
      the last 3 months. Furthermore, participants will have no significant changes in body weight&#xD;
      (&gt;5%) in the last 3 months. Their blood pressure will be below 160/100 mmHg and their resting&#xD;
      heart rate will be below 100 beats per minute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Assessment: An initial visit will be used to perform screening, obtain written&#xD;
      informed consent, and collect baseline data, including: anthropometry (e.g., height, weight,&#xD;
      waist/hip circumference), medical history (e.g., duration of diabetes, medications), exercise&#xD;
      history (i.e., Godin Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire), as well as HbA1c, lipids in last 6&#xD;
      months and Creatinine within last year. We will also measure HbA1c with a point of care&#xD;
      device (DCA vantage) which requires a single drop of blood (similar demands as a capillary&#xD;
      glucose measurements that people with diabetes perform routinely). Body composition with be&#xD;
      estimated with bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA, Tanita TBF-300A). During this initial&#xD;
      visit, participants will also have the opportunity to practice walking on a treadmill at the&#xD;
      speed and grade that will be assigned during the intervention period (5.0km/hr at a grade of&#xD;
      0.5%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Protocol: Walking Conditions and seated control conditions. Participants will&#xD;
      complete standardized bouts of 50 minutes of walking at ~3.5 metabolic equivalents (METs),&#xD;
      which is equivalent to 5.0 km/h at 0.5% incline. This is chosen to represent the typical&#xD;
      physical activity prescription for prevention and treatment of T2D and its complications&#xD;
      (i.e., 150 minutes per week of moderate activity [3-5.9 METs] performed over 3 days of the&#xD;
      week). A standardized 5-minute warm-up and cool-down will be included at a pace of 3.5 km/h&#xD;
      at 0% grade. If a participant cannot comfortably complete 15 minutes of walking at this&#xD;
      intensity in the baseline screening visit they will be allowed to reduce the speed to 4.5&#xD;
      km/h (3.3 METs) or 4.0 km/h (3.1 METs) and this will be recorded. Heart rate and ratings of&#xD;
      perceived exertion will be monitored during exercise and recorded every 10 minutes. Blood&#xD;
      pressure and capillary blood glucose will be monitored before and after exercise.&#xD;
      Participants will complete this walking protocol in the fasted state, 3-4 hours post lunch,&#xD;
      and 30 minutes post dinner. In the seated control condition, participants will sit quietly&#xD;
      and be allowed to read, work on a computer and/or watch a video for 60 minutes to match the&#xD;
      time spent walking in the alternate intervention. At the beginning and end of each walking&#xD;
      and sedentary control condition, participants will be ask to expire into a mouth piece&#xD;
      connected to a metabolic cart for the measurement of oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide&#xD;
      production. With guidance from the study coordinator, participants will also perform a 24&#xD;
      hour recall of the foods they consumed on the previous day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standardized Diet: Participants will be provided with all their food (breakfast, lunch,&#xD;
      dinner, and snacks) for two days in each condition. Macronutrient profile will be based on&#xD;
      Diabetes Canada guidelines with meal/snack providing ~55% carbohydrate (focusing on low&#xD;
      glycemic index), ~30% fat, and ~15% protein. Participants will be provided with a food log&#xD;
      with prescribed timing for each meal and will be asked to complete this log to confirm&#xD;
      compliance and record any deviations with the diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summary of laboratory visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 1. Participants will arrive to PADL at their designated appointment time and an&#xD;
           individual will insert both the Medtronic and Freestyle Libre CGM. They will be given&#xD;
           standardized meals at this visit which will be consumed on days 2 and 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 2. Participants will arrive at PADL for the first of the 4 conditions. The&#xD;
           randomization process will determine which of the conditions will be completed and the&#xD;
           state (fasted or fed) that the participant will come in.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 3. Standardized meals (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) will be consumed on day 3.&#xD;
           There is no lab visit on day 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 4. As a wash out day, participants will resume their typical daily activities and&#xD;
           eating habits which will be recorded in their log books.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 5. Participants will complete condition 2 on this day. Standardized meals will be&#xD;
           consumed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 6. Standardized meals (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) will be consumed on day 6.&#xD;
           There is no lab visit on day 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 7.The Medtronic CGM will be taken out and replaced with another Medtronic device&#xD;
           (Note: the Medtronic CGM lasts for 6 days while the newer Abbott CGM lasts for 14 days).&#xD;
           Standardized meals will be consumed on this day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 8. Condition 3 will be completed on this day. Standardized meals will be consumed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 9. No lab visit this day. Standardized meals will be consumed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 10. As a wash out day, participants will resume their typical daily activities and&#xD;
           eating habits which will be recorded in their log books.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 11. Participants will complete condition 4 on this day. Standardized meals will be&#xD;
           consumed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 12. Standardized meals (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) will be consumed on day 6 and&#xD;
           then the CGMs will be removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses. Data from both CGMs will be compared between the 24-hour periods which follow each&#xD;
      intervention. Parameters of interest include post meal area under the glucose curve, mean&#xD;
      glucose, glycemic variability, fasting glucose, time spent in hyperglycemia (&gt;10mmol/l), and&#xD;
      time spent in hypoglycemia (&lt;4mmol/l). A one-way Anova will be used to compare the 4&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;
