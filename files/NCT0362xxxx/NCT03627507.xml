  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis B is a common and serious infectious disease of the liver, affecting millions of&#xD;
      people throughout the world. Persistent Hepatitis B virus infections may cause development of&#xD;
      chronic hepatic insufficiency, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Adding to that,&#xD;
      Hepatitis B Virus carriers can transmit the disease for many years. It is transmitted through&#xD;
      blood or other body fluids infected with the Hepatitis B virus. It is a major cause of&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality in countries like Bangladesh. Immunization with Hepatitis B vaccine&#xD;
      has been proved effective to prevent HBV infection. But the vaccines, which are recommended&#xD;
      till now, are expensive. Locally manufactured Hepatitis B vaccine will be safe, cost&#xD;
      effective and affordable for all.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The test vaccine will induce similar seroprotection rates to hepatitis B one month&#xD;
      post-vaccination and at 7 months, one month after the third dose of vaccine compared to&#xD;
      reference vaccine. This will be done by comparing the percentages of participants with ≥10&#xD;
      mIU/ml anti-HBs by vaccinated with either Hepa B or Engerix B vaccine. The non-inferiority&#xD;
      margin will be 10%.&#xD;

      Research Protocol Title: A randomized observer-blinded non inferiority trial to evaluate the&#xD;
      immunogenicity and safety of locally manufactured Hepatitis B Vaccine 'Hepa B' in Bangladeshi&#xD;
      healthy adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background (brief):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Burden: Hepatitis B is a serious and common infectious disease of the liver, affecting&#xD;
           millions of people throughout the world1. The severe pathological consequences of&#xD;
           persistent Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections include the development of chronic hepatic&#xD;
           insufficiency, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 1. More than 2000 million&#xD;
           people alive today have been infected with HBV at some time in their lives. 1 Of these,&#xD;
           about 350 million remain infected chronically and become carriers of the virus. 1 Three&#xD;
           quarters of the world's population live in areas where there are high levels of&#xD;
           infection 1. Every year there are over 4 million acute clinical cases of HBV and about&#xD;
           25% of carriers, 1 million people a year, die from chronic active hepatitis, cirrhosis&#xD;
           or primary liver cancer 1. HBV prevalence in Bangladesh is 2.3 to 9.7 percent with an&#xD;
           approximate carrier pool of 10 million. These include healthy adult population 4.4 to&#xD;
           9.7%, healthy children 3%, school girls 2.3%, a rural community 6.4%, and slum&#xD;
           communities 3.8%.2,3 About 25-30% population of Bangladesh do not test positive for&#xD;
           HBsAg rather test positive for another marker of HBV that is with anti HBc4. Thus about&#xD;
           50 million Bangladeshi people are infected with HBV and transmission of their blood and&#xD;
           body fluids may transmit HBV to healthy uninfected person4.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Knowledge gap: The prevention of chronic HBV infection has become a high priority in the&#xD;
           global community. Immunization with hepatitis B vaccine is the most effective means of&#xD;
           preventing HBV infection and its consequence. Vaccine against hepatitis B was introduced&#xD;
           in the early 1980s. Recombinant vaccines became available in the mid 1980s.1 Bangladesh&#xD;
           introduced Hepatitis B vaccine in the EPI, immunization schedule in a small scale from&#xD;
           2003 but nationwide it was available from 20095 .The HBV prevalence in Bangladesh is 2.3&#xD;
           to 9.7 percent with an approximate carrier pool of 10 million. These include healthy&#xD;
           adult population 4.4 to 9.7%, healthy children 3%, school girls 2.3%, a rural community&#xD;
           6.4%, and slum communities 3.8%2,3 . WHO recommended to vaccinate all children and&#xD;
           adolescents younger than 18 years-old living in low or intermediate endemicity and also&#xD;
           in these settings to vaccinate people in high-risk groups who may acquire the&#xD;
           infection6. Currently there is no locally manufactured Hepatitis B vaccine available in&#xD;
           Bangladesh. The results of this study will provide information regarding the&#xD;
           immunogenicity and safety of the locally manufactured Hepatitis B vaccine 'Hepa B' as a&#xD;
           test vaccine using 'Engerix B' as a comparator vaccine in a non inferiority study&#xD;
           design.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Relevance: The study of this locally manufactured Hepatitis B vaccine, 'Hepa B' among&#xD;
           adults will be able to give us information regarding the safety and immunogenicity of&#xD;
           the vaccine and compare this locally produced Hepatitis B vaccine 'Hepa B' with 'Engerix&#xD;
           B' vaccine. Hepa B has undergone technology transfer from BioBridge company in Pune,&#xD;
           India. Incepta and BioBridge entered into an agreement for transfer of technology for&#xD;
           manufacture of locally produced 'Hepa- B' in Bangladesh. The regulatory requirements as&#xD;
           well as licensure of the vaccine will be initiated in Bangladesh. Currently there are no&#xD;
           locally manufactured Bulk of Hepatitis B available in Bangladesh. Once these clinical&#xD;
           trials will be completed, Incepta will apply for licensure of Hepa B to the Bangladesh&#xD;
           DGDA. This will significantly reduce the cost of vaccine and ensure availability to the&#xD;
           people of Bangladesh. Currently the imported vaccine &quot;Engerix B 1 ml&quot; is sold at a price&#xD;
           of 608 taka where as Incepta can sell the product at 500 taka. So, in each unit price&#xD;
           difference is 108 taka. As each individual needs 3 doses, so it will be 324 taka saved&#xD;
           for each subject. Thus the vaccine cost could be significantly reduced and save a large&#xD;
           amount of foreign currency of Bangladesh Government.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypothesis (if any): Locally produced intramuscular non-infectious recombinant DNA&#xD;
           vaccine Hepa-B is non inferior in terms of immunogenicity and safety among adults in&#xD;
           Bangladesh as compared to Engerix-B.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
           • To evaluate and compare the immunogenicity and safety of locally produced Hepatitis B&#xD;
           vaccine 'Hepa-B' with Engerix-B among healthy adults in Bangladesh.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
           This will be a randomized observer-blinded and comparative study on a total of 158&#xD;
           healthy adult participants. Hepa B (Test group) and Engerix B (Comparator Group)&#xD;
           controlled non inferiority study in healthy adult (20-45 years of age). 79 participants&#xD;
           will receive Hepa B 1.0 ml and another 79 participants will receive Engerix B 1.0 ml&#xD;
           Outcome measures/variables: To evaluate and compare the immunogenicity and safety of&#xD;
           locally produced Hepa B with Engerix B.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
           • To evaluate and compare the immunogenicity and safety of locally produced Hepatitis B&#xD;
           vaccine 'Hepa B' with 'Engerix B' in healthy adults in Bangladesh.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Primary end points:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. The test vaccine will induce similar seroprotection rates to hepatitis B one month&#xD;
                post vaccination and at 7 months, one month after the third dose of vaccine&#xD;
                compared to comparator vaccine. This will be done by comparing the percentage of&#xD;
                participants with ≥10 mIU/ml anti HBs after vaccination with either Hepa B or&#xD;
                Engerix B vaccine. The non inferiority margin will be 10%.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Number of immediate reactions reported within 30 minutes after vaccination&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Number of solicited adverse events (prelisted in the participant's memory aid)&#xD;
                occurring up to 4 days following vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Number of unsolicited AEs up to 30 days after each dose of vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Occurrence of serious adverse events (SAEs) throughout the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary end points:&#xD;
&#xD;
           1. The Ratio of the GMTs of test and comparator vaccines in different time points.&#xD;
