    <textblock>
      This is a Phase Ib study to evaluate the safety and preliminary anti-tumor activity of&#xD;
      pembrolizumab in combination with pemetrexed with or without oxaliplatin in patients with&#xD;
      chemo-refractory microsatellite stable (MSS) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) without any&#xD;
      further standard treatment options.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The co-primary endpoints of the study are to 1) establish the recommended Phase II dose&#xD;
      (RP2D) of pembrolizumab in combination with pemetrexed and oxaliplatin and 2) evaluate the&#xD;
      antitumor efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary aims of the study are to 1) evaluate the clinical benefit rate (CBR) of&#xD;
      pembrolizumab in combination with pemetrexed and with pembrolizumab in combination with&#xD;
      pemetrexed and oxaliplatin in patients with chemo-refractory MSS mCRC and 2) to estimate the&#xD;
      progression free survival (PFS) and 3) overall survival (OS) in patients with MSS mCRC&#xD;
      treated with pembrolizumab and pemetrexed or with pembrolizumab in combination with&#xD;
      pemetrexed and oxaliplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients enrolled to Cohort 1 will receive: pembrolizumab 200mg IV and pemetrexed 500 mg/m2&#xD;
      on Day 1 of each 21 day cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 2 (the dose escalation portion of the study) will be a standard &quot;3+3&quot; design; 2 dose&#xD;
      levels are planned. The first 3 to 6 patients in cohort 2 will be treated at dose level 1 and&#xD;
      will receive pembrolizumab 200 mg IV, pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 IV and oxaliplatin 85 mg/ m2 on&#xD;
      Day 1 of each 21 day cycle. If 1 of 3 patients in this cohort experiences a dose-limiting&#xD;
      toxicity (DLT), see Section 6.4, 3 more patients will be added at the same dose level. If 0&#xD;
      of 3 initial patients or 1 of 6 patients in the cohort experiences a DLT, the dose for the&#xD;
      next cohort will be escalated to dose level 2 and will receive pembrolizumab 200 mg IV,&#xD;
      pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 IV and oxaliplatin 120 mg/ m2 on Day 1 of each 21 day cycle; otherwise,&#xD;
      the combination will be considered too toxic. If ≥ 2 DLTs are experienced at any dose level,&#xD;
      the combination will be considered too toxic and the next lower dose level will be considered&#xD;
      the RP2D. A total of 12 patients will be treated at the RP2D as the expansion portion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in both cohorts will continue to receive study therapy (maximum of 35 cycles) unless&#xD;
      therapy is discontinued due to patient election, toxicity, or disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) will be monitored during the first 21 days (Cycle 1) of each&#xD;
      dose level in Cohort 2 and will be used for purposes of dose escalation and determination of&#xD;
      RP2D. A DLT is defined as a non-hematologic adverse event (AE) of grade ≥ 3 or a hematologic&#xD;
      toxicity of grade ≥ 4. Toxicity will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute&#xD;
      (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The highest dose level tolerable without dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) in &lt; 2 of 6 patients&#xD;
      will be considered the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and be expanded to 12 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The maximum total enrollment of the study is 33 patients. In Cohort 1, a total of 15 patients&#xD;
      with chemo-refractory MSS mCRC will be treated for further safety assessment and a&#xD;
      preliminary signal. In Cohort 2, 3 to 6 patients will be accrued per dose level. A total of&#xD;
      12 patients with chemo-refractory MSS mCRC will be treated on the RP2D for further safety and&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy signal. Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 will be analyzed separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy will be evaluated as the individual best overall response as defined by a modified&#xD;
      RECIST 1.1 (mRECIST 1.1). The objective response rate (complete response [CR] and partial&#xD;
      response [PR]) will be determined. In either dose level cohort &gt; 3 patients (&gt; 3 of 18) with&#xD;
      objective response (PR or CR) will warrant further investigation.&#xD;
