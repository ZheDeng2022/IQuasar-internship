      To evaluate the safety of secondary chemotherapy induced thrombocytopenia (reduction in&#xD;
      platelets which leads to bleeding) prophylaxis with romiplostim in ovarian cancer subjects&#xD;
      receiving myelosuppressive (blood cell damaging) chemotherapy.It is anticipated that&#xD;
      Romiplostim, when administered at an effective dose and schedule, will be a well-tolerated&#xD;
      treatment for subjects experiencing chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy of recurrent ovarian cancer leads to severe thrombocytopenia in a considerable&#xD;
      proportion of the patients, requiring treatment delays or dose reductions, and placing the&#xD;
      patient at a high risk of bleeding complications. The amount of thrombocytopenia is highly&#xD;
      schedule-dependent. In platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer that relapsed more than 6 months&#xD;
      after end of primary therapy, a platinum containing reinduction therapy - the combination of&#xD;
      paclitaxel/carboplatin, gemcitabine/carboplatin or PLD/carboplatin - is recommended according&#xD;
      to the current AGO guidelines or recent ASCO presentations. Especially the latter two&#xD;
      regimens often induce severe and even dose-limiting myelosuppression, including&#xD;
      thrombocytopenia. Therefore, prophylaxis, or at least secondary prophylaxis of this toxicity&#xD;
      is an important goal of supportive therapy. The use of platelet transfusions is limited by&#xD;
      cost, supply problems, and associated risks, such as transfusion reactions, transmission of&#xD;
      infection, and alloimmunization and platelet refractoriness. In contrast to the situation for&#xD;
      the red and white blood cell compartments, the implementation of growth factor treatment in&#xD;
      order to ameliorate the therapy of thrombocytopenia and its complications, is yet very&#xD;
      limited. Romiplostim is an active second-generation thrombopoietic agent without safety&#xD;
      problems due to immunogenicity, which proved to be beneficial in the treatment of immune&#xD;
      thrombocytopenic purpura and myelodysplastic syndromes. The rationale of this trial is to&#xD;
      obtain evidence that romiplostim can improve platelet counts/recovery in the treatment of&#xD;
      recurrent ovarian cancer. Due to the fact, that the expected occurrence of severe&#xD;
      thrombocytopenia and its complications may heavily depend on the selection of patient and&#xD;
      their characteristics such as actually chosen treatment schedule, tumor stage, extent of&#xD;
      metastasis, pre-treatment etc. a phase II design comparing the results to historical data or&#xD;
      expectations is insufficient. A simple within-group control design, comparing subsequent&#xD;
      cycles of the same patients with or without the supportive experimental drug may also be&#xD;
      flawed, as &quot;spontaneous&quot; improvements after obviously unchanged chemotherapy are often&#xD;
      observed. With some regimens, the first cycle proves to be generally more toxic than later&#xD;
      ones. On the other hand, regimens may result in cumulative myelosuppression. A design&#xD;
      including a randomized doubleblind control group is therefore warranted, moreover, as&#xD;
      platelet counts represent a sensitive and valid surrogate marker for a clinical benefit. The&#xD;
      current study will employ a model of secondary prophylaxis. The enrolment of subjects with&#xD;
      grade 3 and/or 4 thrombocytopenia will facilitate an assessment of the ability of romiplostim&#xD;
      to impact thrombocytopenia at clinically significant levels, which warrant the administration&#xD;
      of platelet transfusions, dose reduction, and dose delay.&#xD;
