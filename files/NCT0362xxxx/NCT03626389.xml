      Background: Physiotherapists (PTs) in primary health care manage patients with a large&#xD;
      variation in medical diagnosis, age, functional status, disability and prognosis. Lack of&#xD;
      knowledge and systematically collected data about patients treated by PTs in primary health&#xD;
      care has prompted this longitudinal observational physiotherapy project in Norway. This paper&#xD;
      aims to describe a method for developing a database of patients managed by PTs in primary&#xD;
      health care to study patients' characteristics, treatment courses and prognostic factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a longitudinal observational project, following patients through physiotherapy&#xD;
      treatment periods in primary health care in Norway and until one year after inclusion. The&#xD;
      project involves both private practice and municipally employed PTs working in primary health&#xD;
      care in eight municipalities in Norway. The participants are recruited to three different&#xD;
      parts of the project depending on age and whether they are referred to a private practice or&#xD;
      a municipally employed PT. All data are recorded electronically, transferred and stored&#xD;
      securely. All patients complete extensive questionnaires providing information about&#xD;
      demographics, disability and function, pain related variables, treatment and evaluation of&#xD;
      treatment as well as clinical tests. The PTs have access to their own patients' data. The&#xD;
      investigators have also prepared for linkage to national patient registers and&#xD;
      population-based studies to be able to gather further important data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will have important implications for physiotherapy services in primary health&#xD;
      care. The database already contains almost 3000 patients, and data collection is ongoing.&#xD;
      Preliminary analyses suggest that the patients included so far are representative of the&#xD;
      larger population of patients treated by private practice or municipally employed PTs in&#xD;
      Norway. This large scale prospective physiotherapy project will provide knowledge about the&#xD;
      patient groups treated, treatment given as well as short and long term outcome of the&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of the FYSIOPRIM project is to build a database by systematically collecting&#xD;
      data from baseline throughout the intervention period and beyond, including both&#xD;
      patient-reported outcome measures, the patients' and PTs' goals and plans for intervention,&#xD;
      and their evaluation thereof. This will enable description of patients receiving&#xD;
      physiotherapy services, of goal-setting and type of interventions and how general health,&#xD;
      physical function and relevant clinical factors change throughout and after a treatment&#xD;
      period. Secondly, the investigators want to study associations and interaction effects&#xD;
      between and among clinical characteristics, interventions and change as well as perform&#xD;
      health-economic evaluations. The investigators will also examine how physiotherapy practice&#xD;
      is affected by using the system for systematic registration of clinical data and effects of&#xD;
      such registration. Moreover, the investigators will be able to compare patients receiving&#xD;
      physiotherapy services with information from national patient registries. In addition,&#xD;
      elderly participants' physical fitness, balance and walking ability will be examined to study&#xD;
      associations between these aspects of physical functioning and health-related quality of&#xD;
      life, self-reported physical and psychological functioning as well as response to physical&#xD;
      fitness tests. The investigators will compare data from this group of elderly with data from&#xD;
      other patients with musculoskeletal complaints who receive physiotherapy treatment, and with&#xD;
      similar data from large population-based studies in Norway. Finally, this project enables&#xD;
      methodological studies to validate clinical tests and questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and setting This is a longitudinal observational project following patients through&#xD;
      physiotherapy treatment periods in primary health care in Norway and until one year after&#xD;
      baseline. The project involves both private practice and municipally employed PTs working in&#xD;
      primary health care in eight municipalities of Norway; LÃ¸renskog, Ski, Nedre Eiker,&#xD;
      Lillehammer, Stavanger, Bergen, Trondheim and Alta. All five health regions of Norway are&#xD;
      represented. The Norwegian Health care system is publicly funded. PTs working as private&#xD;
      practitioners have an agreement with the municipality. Hence, they are partly paid by the&#xD;
      municipality (as a financial support for practice) and partly paid per visit by the Norwegian&#xD;
      Health Economics Administration (HELFO) and the patient's charge (maximum around 200 Euro per&#xD;
      patient per calendar year). Patients seeking physiotherapy services in private practice will&#xD;
      normally meet at the PT's clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Municipally employed PTs are on fixed salary. They work in an out-patient setting, and their&#xD;
      patients receive physiotherapy services in their usual daily environment, i.e. for children&#xD;
      at home, in kindergarten or in school, and for elderly patients often in their own home.&#xD;
      There are no clear guidelines for which patients that should receive physiotherapy from a&#xD;
      private practice or a municipally employed PT. The choice can be based on previous personal&#xD;
      experiences with physiotherapy, the possibility to visit a clinic, evaluation of need and/or&#xD;
      benefit of treating the patients in their own setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Characteristics of participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants are recruited to three different parts of the project depending on age and&#xD;
      whether they are referred to a private practice PT or to a municipally employed PT (in this&#xD;
      project, these PTs are from Trondheim). The three parts of the project are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Adults seeking physiotherapy services in private practice This part of the project&#xD;
           started data collection in June 2015, and data collection is planned to continue through&#xD;
           June 2020. From January 2016 through December 2017, data were collected from a total of&#xD;
           2754 patients above the age of 18 years seeking physiotherapy treatment from 111 PTs in&#xD;
           eight municipalities in different parts of Norway, including 536 patients already in&#xD;
           treatment. Among the 111 PTs, 78 (70.3%) are general PTs, 20 (18.0%) are manual&#xD;
           therapists and13 (11.7%) are PTs with special education in psychomotor physiotherapy.&#xD;
           Seventy-seven (69.4%) of the PTs are working in Trondheim.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Adults and elderly receiving physiotherapy services in Trondheim Municipality This part&#xD;
           of the project collected data from the beginning of May 2016 to the end of May 2018.&#xD;
           From January 2016 until the end of September 2017, data were collected from 684 adults&#xD;
           and elderly patients receiving physiotherapy services from approximately 55 PTs working&#xD;
           with adults and elderly in the municipality of Trondheim in Norway. Adults and elderly&#xD;
           may be referred from general practitioners, occupational therapists, health&#xD;
           professionals at health care centers, rehabilitation centers or hospitals, or by proxy.&#xD;
           The physiotherapy services to adults and elderly include early intervention, activities&#xD;
           of daily living (ADL) rehabilitation and ordinary physiotherapy, all of which are&#xD;
           typically delivered in a home setting. Early intervention is a collaboration between&#xD;
           health and welfare centers and units for physiotherapy and occupational services and is&#xD;
           offered to patients in need of limited services who are referred to municipality health&#xD;
           care services for the first time. ADL rehabilitation are offered to patients in risk of&#xD;
           functional deterioration who are receiving home based services, while ordinary&#xD;
           physiotherapy is offered to patients in need of more specific physiotherapy services.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Children receiving physiotherapy services in Trondheim Municipality This part of the&#xD;
           project collected data from May 2016 through April 2017. During this period, data were&#xD;
           collected from 165 children aged 0-18 years receiving physiotherapy services from&#xD;
           approximately 25 PTs working with children in the municipality of Trondheim in Norway.&#xD;
           For children, physiotherapy may be initiated on referral from parents, personnel at&#xD;
           kindergarten or in school, general practitioners, occupational therapists, and health&#xD;
           professionals at primary health care centers or hospitals. The children typically&#xD;
           receive physiotherapy services at the primary health care centers, in their own home or&#xD;
           in kindergarten or at school, depending on the child's usual primary location and&#xD;
           condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection Patients are asked to participate at their first time encounter with a&#xD;
      physiotherapist in primary health care. Project information and consent forms are available&#xD;
      in Norwegian and English. The investigators collect baseline data in two steps. First, the&#xD;
      therapist and the participant together fill in information about the main problem, and&#xD;
      jointly agree on goals for treatment and a treatment plan. The therapist also asks the&#xD;
      participant for their own specific functional problem using the Patient-Specific Functional&#xD;
      Scale (PSFS). The therapist provides information about the referral, diagnosis and whether&#xD;
      any disease-specific questionnaires should be used for this participant. Secondly, the&#xD;
      participant completes questionnaires themselves, either using an e-tablet or through a&#xD;
      web-link sent by e-mail. A set of outcome data are common to all, and in addition&#xD;
      disease-specific outcome measures are included for some common patient groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 1 month after baseline (for participants seeking PTs in private practice), or&#xD;
      2-3 months after baseline (for participants receiving physiotherapy from municipally employed&#xD;
      PTs), the therapist and the participant together evaluate goal achievement and fulfilment of&#xD;
      the treatment plan so far. They also adjust these when needed and the participant recompletes&#xD;
      the PSFS. Three months (for private practice) or six months after baseline (for participants&#xD;
      receiving physiotherapy from municipally employed PTs), the PT and the participant again&#xD;
      evaluate goal achievement and fulfilments of the treatment plan. The participant then&#xD;
      completes the same standardized questionnaires as at baseline. The same questionnaires are&#xD;
      also completed 6 and 12 months after baseline by participants treated by PTs in private&#xD;
      practice using a web-link sent by smartphone or e-mail. All participants treated by PTs in&#xD;
      private practice receive reminders once a week, up to three times, by sms and e-mail if they&#xD;
      have not answered the questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data are collected electronically using an application run on a tablet or through a&#xD;
      web-link. The software is provided by Infopad AS (www.infopad.no). Immediately after the&#xD;
      completion of the questionnaires all data are transferred to a backend secure server with&#xD;
      in-memory encryption. The PTs have access to their own participants' data either through a&#xD;
      web-site and/or by importing data into their electronic medical journal. The journal number&#xD;
      of the participant is used as the study identifier to enable data flow between the electronic&#xD;
      medical journal and the secure backend server. The data from all participants are copied to a&#xD;
      secure server at the University of Oslo set up for research purposes (Services for Sensitive&#xD;
      Data). Data management is done according to the quality assurance system of the University of&#xD;
      Oslo. The investigators have prepared for linkage between data from FYSIOPRIM and data from&#xD;
      national patient registers. This will be done by use of the participant's journal number to&#xD;
      access their unique 11-digit Norwegian personal number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the data are collected electronically, thereby avoiding the possibility of mistakes when&#xD;
      transferring data from paper forms to electronic data. Data management is performed using&#xD;
      STATA 15 (Stata Corp., College Station, Texas, USA). The raw data are stored in a secure&#xD;
      database where only researchers associated with the project have access. Before data can be&#xD;
      used for analyses a range of automated procedures for data preparation and quality checking&#xD;
      are performed using standardized, written scripts in STATA. Examples are to check, i)&#xD;
      patterns of missing data, ii) values outside the possible range of a variable (e.g., age&gt;120&#xD;
      years), iii) conflicting answers (e.g., pregnancy and male) and iv) unexpected frequency&#xD;
      distributions for categorical variables. The investigators will explore each variable&#xD;
      graphically using histograms and plots to evaluate the data distribution. Descriptive&#xD;
      statistics will be used to describe the patient populations using parametric or&#xD;
      non-parametric statistics according to the data distribution. Detailed descriptions of all&#xD;
      the statistical analyses planned are beyond the length of this paper. Thus, specific analyses&#xD;
      related to investigation of associations between variables, prognosis and clinical course&#xD;
      will be described in future publications.&#xD;
