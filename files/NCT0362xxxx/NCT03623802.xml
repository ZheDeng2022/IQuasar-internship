      Systematic reviews evaluating the effectiveness of supervised exercise therapies commonly&#xD;
      conclude that, to date, there is no evidence to support the superiority of one form of&#xD;
      exercise over another. Randomized controlled trials to date included mostly trunk&#xD;
      strengthening exercises (e.g. bird dog, plank) and there is no evidence about supervised,&#xD;
      individually graded integral movement therapy program for patients with chronic low back pain&#xD;
      (CLBP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research design is a randomized clinical trial with parallel-group design including two&#xD;
      intervention groups: integral movement therapy and conventional local movement therapy.&#xD;
      Participants in each group will receive 20 supervised sessions in a 10 week period, two times&#xD;
      per week, with approximately 1 hour per session. Outcome assessments will occur at baseline&#xD;
      and immediately post-intervention, follow up will take place at 6 months and 12 months after&#xD;
      finishing the intervention. Pre specified analyses will evaluate the main effects of the&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will use a novel, previously unexplored integral approach to CLBP through&#xD;
      exercises. In contrast to commonly used exercise programs, the integral program does not&#xD;
      include specific local strength exercises for hip and trunk flexors and extensors. However,&#xD;
      learning dynamic trunk muscle control in various body positions with added limb movements&#xD;
      could be beneficial because of the parallels to everyday work. The study will contribute to&#xD;
      clinical practice by providing evidence to guide professionals when deciding for the proper&#xD;
      and efficient treatment of patients with CLBP.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Literature suggests several different methods for coping with CLBP. Supervised exercise&#xD;
      therapies are among the most commonly advocated treatments for nonspecific CLBP. However,&#xD;
      findings from a systematic reviews concluded the most effective model of exercise therapy&#xD;
      remain uncertain. Although several supervised randomized controlled trails, focusing on&#xD;
      different approaches for managing the CLBP using movement therapy have been published so far,&#xD;
      there is no evidence about integral movement therapy program for patients with CLBP.&#xD;
      Systematic reviews evaluating the effectiveness of supervised exercise therapies commonly&#xD;
      conclude that, to date, there is no evidence to support the superiority of one form of&#xD;
      exercise over another. Randomized controlled trials to date include mostly trunk&#xD;
      strengthening exercises (e.g. bird dog, plank).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Primary study aim is to evaluate the efficiency of supervised and individually graded&#xD;
      integral movement therapy program in patients with CLBP on pain, quality of life and&#xD;
      functional abilities. Further, the secondary aim is to compare the difference in outcome&#xD;
      measures to supervised, conventional local movement therapy. The following research questions&#xD;
      are addressed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (I) Does the supervised and individually graded integral movement therapy program have an&#xD;
      effect on reducing pain, improving the quality of life and functional abilities in patients&#xD;
      with chronic idiopathic low back pain? (II) Does the supervised and individually graded&#xD;
      integral movement therapy program have a clinically more significant effect on reducing pain,&#xD;
      improving the quality of life and functional abilities compared to the supervised,&#xD;
      conventional local movement therapy? (III) Which program has a better effect on specific core&#xD;
      stability strength (e.g., maximal isometric trunk flexion, extension and lateral flexion) and&#xD;
      proprioception?&#xD;
&#xD;
      We intend to allocate 80 adults, aged between 30 and 60 years old, into two groups. Repeated&#xD;
      measurements will be performed at the baseline and post therapy. Follow-up measures will take&#xD;
      place 6 months and one year after the last therapy and include an International Physical&#xD;
      Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), qualitative and quantitative assessment of pain with the&#xD;
      Oswestry disability index questionnaire (ODI) and the Numerical rating scale (NRS)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Chronic idiopathic low back pain which persists at least 12 weeks or two acute low back&#xD;
           pain episodes in the last 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients aged between 30 and 60 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Capable of at least low physical activity to be able to complete movement therapy&#xD;
           program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Severe spinal stenosis, spondylolisthesis, fibromyalgia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Lumbar spine surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Vascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Neurological deficits because of nerve root or spinal cord compression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Ongoing treatment for low back pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Comorbid health conditions that could prevent active participation in exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in each group will receive 20 supervised sessions in 10 weeks' time, two times&#xD;
      per week, with approximately 1 hour per session. Sessions will be carried out in small&#xD;
      groups, up to 5 participants and will be supervised by an experienced kinesiologist or&#xD;
      physiotherapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both therapy programs start with general warm up on the elliptic trainer machine for 5&#xD;
      minutes, followed by specific warm up for the next 5 minutes including hip flexors, hip&#xD;
      extensors and back extensors stretching. Each stretch is repeated once and held for 30&#xD;
      seconds. Part of the warm up routine is also learning the squat technique, pelvic neutral&#xD;
      position and posture corrections. The Cool down routine includes same stretches as the warm&#xD;
      up, with each stretch repeated twice (Additional file 3, part 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each week, participants will receive a verbal quote of the week - back school. Quotes will be&#xD;
      focused on posture, core activation and back position during lifting and carrying the loads,&#xD;
      self-management of back pain, standing up and sitting down on the floor, pushing and pulling&#xD;
      the objects and putting shoes on and off.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will be asked to keep his/her own exercise diary in order to follow the&#xD;
      exercise intensity - body position, color of elastic, number of sets and repetitions in each&#xD;
      set. Participant can move to the next level of exercise, when the required number of&#xD;
      repetitions and sets are performed without any compensatory movements of the body and with&#xD;
      complete core stability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Integral movement therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Load and intensity of exercises will be increased according to participants' abilities.&#xD;
      Modifications of exercises are made by different body positions with decreasing the stability&#xD;
      of body position or increasing elastic resistance. When a participant is able to perform a&#xD;
      certain number of repetitions and sets of the required exercise, without any compensatory&#xD;
      movements, he/she can proceed to the next level of exercise. There will be 1-2 minutes breaks&#xD;
      between each exercise and 20 seconds breaks between sets of the same exercise. In the set&#xD;
      break, participants will perform easy trunk motions (e.g.: hip circling, lateral flexion), to&#xD;
      increase hydration of the intervertebral discs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol consists of four basic exercises, which are progressed through sessions (Additional&#xD;
      file 3, part 2):&#xD;
&#xD;
      (I) Proprioception - sitting on an unstable surface - Swiss ball, with additional tasks with&#xD;
      legs and arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (II) Strength - pushing task in different body positions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Unstable position - from single plane to multi-plane arm movements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Stable position - high number of repetitions - single plane movement. (III) Strength -&#xD;
           pulling task in different body positions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      a) Unstable position - from single plane to multi-plane arm movements. b) Stable position -&#xD;
      high number of repetitions - single plane movement. (IV) Lifting and carrying the loads:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Stoop lifting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Squat lifting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Half kneeling lifting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Local movement therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Loads and intensity of exercises will be increased according to participants' abilities.&#xD;
      Modifications of exercises are made through different body positions or increasing the load.&#xD;
      When a participant is able to perform a certain number of repetitions and sets of a required&#xD;
      exercise, without any compensatory movements, he/she can proceed to the next level of&#xD;
      exercise. Breaks between exercises and sets are the same as in the integral movement therapy&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol consists of four basic exercises, which are progressed through sessions (Additional&#xD;
      file 3, part 3):&#xD;
&#xD;
      (I) Abdomen curl. (II) Trunk extension on roman chair. (III) Hip bridge. (IV) Side plank.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two aspects of primary outcome measures. First part of the measures is based on&#xD;
      different questionnaires: level of disability (ODI questionnaire), physical activity (IPAQ&#xD;
      questionnaire) and pain (NRS questionnaire). All questionnaires will be conducted at&#xD;
      baseline, immediately post-intervention, 6 months and 12 months after finishing the&#xD;
      intervention, as medium and long-term follow-ups. Second part consists of different&#xD;
      functional tests: timed up and go test (TUG), sit to stand test, chair seat and reach test&#xD;
      (CSR), 6 minute walk test (6MW), Biering Sorensen test (BS), modified Schober test (mSCH) and&#xD;
      Sharpened Romberg balance test (SRB). Those will be collected at baseline and immediately&#xD;
      post-intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ODI questionnaire is one of the instruments for measuring disability caused by low back&#xD;
      pain. The Slovenian version of the ODI questionnaire is a reliable and valid instrument for&#xD;
      assessing outcomes of physical therapy in patients with chronic non-specific low back pain.&#xD;
      IPAQ was developed as an instrument for cross-national monitoring of physical activity and&#xD;
      inactivity and has reasonable measurement properties for monitoring population levels of&#xD;
      physical activity among 18-65 years old adults in diverse settings. Pain intensity is&#xD;
      frequently measured on an 11-point pain intensity numerical rating scale, where 0 means no&#xD;
      pain and 10 is worst possible pain. On average, a reduction of two points or a reduction of&#xD;
      approximately 30% in the NRS considered as a clinically important difference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TUG test, sit to stand test, CSR and 6MW test are part of Senior Fitness Test battery.&#xD;
      Specifically, the tests measure the level of physical abilities (strength, endurance,&#xD;
      agility) that are impaired in patients with chronic low back pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weak trunk muscles and reduced flexibility/elasticity of the back and hamstrings were found&#xD;
      as a residual sign, in particular among those with recurrence or persistence of LBP. BS test&#xD;
      provides reliable measures of position-holding time and can discriminate between subjects&#xD;
      with and without nonspecific low back pain. Furthermore, literature states that mSCH test&#xD;
      showed moderate validity and excellent reliability and metrically detected changes in sample&#xD;
      of patients with CLBP. SRB has been reported to have good interrater reliability and&#xD;
      test-retest reliability. Balance will be measured in three different positions of feet,&#xD;
      parallel, semi tandem and tandem position, all with closed and opened eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As this intervention requires no expensive equipment (elastic bands and Swiss ball, optional&#xD;
      weights), it is suitable to perform at any physiotherapy or kinesiology department. What is&#xD;
      more, when patients learn to perform the exercises, they can continue performing it at home&#xD;
      with no extra costs. The study will contribute to clinical practice by providing evidence to&#xD;
      guide professionals when deciding for the proper and efficient treatment of patients with&#xD;
      CLBP. The results of this study will be published once the study is concluded&#xD;
