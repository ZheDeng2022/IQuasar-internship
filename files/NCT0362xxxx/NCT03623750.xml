    <textblock>
      This is a multicentre, open-label, uncontrolled, Phase Ib clinical study. Patients who give&#xD;
      informed consent will be screened for the study, including genotyping of the tumour and&#xD;
      baseline characteristics. Eligible patients will receive a single pre-treatment of low dose&#xD;
      of intravenous cyclophosphamide 200 mg/m2 (Day -3). Patients will commence daily oral therapy&#xD;
      with the EGFR TKI afatinib as soon as possible, preferably on the same day as low dose&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide. Afatinib will be prescribed according to the Summary of Product&#xD;
      Characteristics (SmPC) of the product, and will continue in nominal 21-day cycles for as long&#xD;
      as clinically indicated. The first day of dosing with EGF-PTI will be designated Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunisation with EGF-PTI will commence 3 days after low dose cyclophosphamide and&#xD;
      commencement of EGFR TKI, and will be repeated on Day 14, Day 28, Day 43, and Day 92. After&#xD;
      the 5 th vaccination, patients will be followed up every 6 weeks for basic safety data and&#xD;
      every 3 months for complete efficacy data, safety data, and maintenance (reduced) doses of&#xD;
      EGF-PTI. Patients will continue in the study until disease progression, death, safety&#xD;
      concerns (in the opinion of the investigator), non-compliance with the protocol, the patient&#xD;
      withdraws from the study, 1 year after randomisation of the last patient, or the study is&#xD;
      stopped the sponsor, whichever occurs sooner&#xD;
