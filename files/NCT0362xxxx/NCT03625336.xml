      Prostate calcifications can limit evaluation of the prostate due to artifact on MRI, and can&#xD;
      limit therapy by blocking therapeutic ultrasound. There is definite need to develop and&#xD;
      validate MR imaging techniques to visualize focal calcifications, especially for focal&#xD;
      therapy planning and monitoring. It will obviate need for CT correlation, help in focal&#xD;
      ablation modality selection and give true relative location of the calcification vis-à-vis&#xD;
      visualized tumor without need for fusion. Imaging calcifications and evaluation of their&#xD;
      effect on high energy ultrasound will help us define clinically significant calcifications.&#xD;
      It is also the first step in development of techniques to mitigate effect of calcifications&#xD;
      on therapeutic ultrasound. Multiple promising MR sequences are available for possible&#xD;
      evaluation of the prostate and this study looks to evaluate the ability of those MRI&#xD;
      sequences at detecting and accurately quantifying prostatic calcifications compared to CT,&#xD;
      the current gold standard.&#xD;

      The traditional prostate cancer (PCa) screening, diagnosis, and treatment options comprising&#xD;
      of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing, random transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) biopsy, and&#xD;
      prostatectomy/radiation have significant limitations. PSA is a nonspecific test, which is&#xD;
      elevated in many benign situations. The American Cancer Society's estimate of 161,360 new&#xD;
      cases of PCa in the United States in 2017 is a significantly lower number than that of 2016&#xD;
      (180,890) and 2015 (220,800), mostly due to the United States Preventative Services Taskforce&#xD;
      (USPTF) recommendations against routine PSA testing. Random TRUS biopsy is notorious for the&#xD;
      conundrum of overdiagnosis of low-risk PCa and under detection of high-risk PCa. Random&#xD;
      biopsy of the prostate to diagnose or exclude cancer is performed nearly 1,000,000 times&#xD;
      annually in the United States, most frequently as a result of elevated PSA. Less than&#xD;
      one-third of these are positive. Both prostatectomy and radiation are associated with high&#xD;
      risks of incontinence and impotence. Many patients with low- and intermediate-risk disease&#xD;
      unnecessarily undergo these aggressive treatment options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is considerable ongoing effort to improve the deficiencies in the diagnostic and&#xD;
      treatment approaches. For example, better screening methodologies are being developed,&#xD;
      including strategies on how to incorporate prostate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) into the&#xD;
      screening algorithm. The improvement in prostate MRI techniques and advent of targeted biopsy&#xD;
      techniques has enabled physicians to actually see and target the risk driving &quot;index&quot; lesion.&#xD;
      In the treatment realm, a wide range of minimally invasive modalities has been tested for&#xD;
      whole-gland, partial-gland, and focal treatments. Therapeutic ultrasound is a popular&#xD;
      FDA-approved, nonsurgical, &quot;no-needle&quot; ablative therapy that does not use ionizing radiation.&#xD;
      Theoretically, therapeutic ultrasound has the potential to markedly reduce treatment-related&#xD;
      complications that affect urinary and sexual function. While prostate therapeutic ultrasound&#xD;
      is FDA-approved, it is not reimbursed by major insurance carriers and its efficacy is still&#xD;
      under investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As with diagnostic ultrasound, therapeutic ultrasound can be blocked by calcifications&#xD;
      leading to sub-optimal delivery of the thermal dose to the tumor foci. Also, if MR guidance&#xD;
      is being used, the most commonly used method of MR thermometry (proton resonance frequency&#xD;
      shift) doesn't work well in areas with calcifications. Currently, most major manufacturers of&#xD;
      prostate therapeutic ultrasound equipment have limitations related to calcifications:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Sonablate (transrectal ultrasound guided high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU)&#xD;
           device, FDA approved) user manual states that &quot;As with any ultrasound technology,&#xD;
           significant changes in tissue density such as calcifications and/or cysts (depending on&#xD;
           size) may have an effect on ultrasound attenuation and overall energy and may impact the&#xD;
           patient's suitability for treatment&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Ablatherm (FDA approved, similar to Sonablate): While calcifications in ablation volume&#xD;
           are not a contra-indication for prostate ablation with this device, it can treat only&#xD;
           small prostates with larger prostates (&gt; 24 mm AP) requiring cytoreduction via&#xD;
           transurethral resection (TURP) presumably removing most calcifications which are usually&#xD;
           found along the pseudocapsule.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. TULSA-PRO: This is a transurethral MR guided device which is currently undergoing&#xD;
           clinical trials. Calcifications greater than 1 cm are a contra-indication for whole&#xD;
           gland ablation. However, even smaller calcifications can prevent heating of the index&#xD;
           lesion if focal therapy is being attempted. This uses high energy directional ultrasound&#xD;
           (HIDU).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. ExAblate Prostate: This is a transrectal MR guided device which is currently undergoing&#xD;
           clinical trials. Calcifications 2 mm or greater in the ultrasound beam path and less&#xD;
           than 5 mm from the rectal wall are a contra-indication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prostate calcifications are commonly found in elderly men, up to 50% by some estimates with&#xD;
      higher incidence in men who have lower urinary tract symptoms. These are mostly made up of&#xD;
      calcium apatite. They are mostly seen at the junction of transitional zone and peripheral&#xD;
      zone with other locations being rare. Prostate calcifications can be seen as echogenic foci&#xD;
      on ultrasound which may or may not shadow depending on their size. However, cross sectional&#xD;
      information about the calcification is more beneficial especially while therapy planning.&#xD;
      Computed tomography imaging is the current gold-standard for prostate calcification imaging.&#xD;
      Current widely used MR techniques do not adequately image prostate calcifications.&#xD;
      Calcifications are usually T1 and T2 dark but can be bright on both. T1 bright&#xD;
      microcalcifications are noted frequently in the brain. Calcifications have also been shown to&#xD;
      be bright on T2 weighted images (Fahr disease and chondrocalcinosis). The change in signal is&#xD;
      thought to be related to closely associated water molecules in the microcalcification&#xD;
      lattice. Gradient echo images cannot differentiate between calcifications and hemorrhage.&#xD;
      There is definite need to develop and validate MR imaging techniques to visualize focal&#xD;
      calcifications, especially for focal therapy planning and monitoring. It will obviate need&#xD;
      for CT correlation, help in focal ablation modality selection and give true relative location&#xD;
      of the calcification vis-à-vis visualized tumor without need for fusion. Imaging&#xD;
      calcifications and evaluation of their effect on high energy ultrasound will help us define&#xD;
      clinically significant calcifications. It is also the first step in development of techniques&#xD;
      to mitigate effect of calcifications on therapeutic ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 promising MR techniques are available:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A study by Zhu WZ et al., showed that both calcification and hemorrhage manifested low&#xD;
           signal on susceptibility weighted images, but they presented opposite signal features on&#xD;
           the corrected phase images. Significant difference was found in average phase shift&#xD;
           between calcification and hemorrhage (t=74.69, p&lt;0.05). These have been applied in the&#xD;
           prostate before but size correlation has not been reported. An example of SWI imaging&#xD;
           for calcification is provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Zero-time echo (ZTE) and Ultra-short time echo (UTE) images have also been shown to&#xD;
           image tissues with short T2 times like cortical bone. These can be used to study some&#xD;
           stages of calcifications. To our knowledge, these have not been applied in the prostate&#xD;
           before.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Temperature uncertainty images can also be used to visualize calcifications in the&#xD;
           prostate. This was observed in the currently undergoing clinical pivotal clinical trial&#xD;
           of transurethral prostate ablation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison between these three MRI sequences, and the gold standard CT imaging of the pelvis&#xD;
      will be performed to determine whether MRI can reliably identify and accurately measure the&#xD;
      size of the prostate calcifications.&#xD;
