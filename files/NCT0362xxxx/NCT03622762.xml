  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic nephropathy is one of the most feared complications of Diabetes Mellitus type 2,&#xD;
      characterized mainly by the decrease in the glomerular filtration rate and an increase in&#xD;
      protein secretion by the kidney, that results in proteinuria. This has led to the development&#xD;
      of intensive treatment regimens for patients with diabetes and preventive measures since once&#xD;
      the complications have already presented the improvement of glycemic control alone may not be&#xD;
      enough, to prevent the progression of pathological processes. Currently, interventions to&#xD;
      delay the progression of kidney damage, include changes in lifestyle, nutritional advice and&#xD;
      regular exercise, achieve optimal levels in glycemic control and use of pharmacological&#xD;
      therapies with nephroprotector, angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARBs) and&#xD;
      angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs). The most important biochemical mechanism&#xD;
      proposed for this progression is the excessive binding of glucose to proteins, better&#xD;
      described as the final products of advanced glycosylation (AGEs); the interaction of AGEs&#xD;
      with its receptor (RAGE), participates in the metabolic and biochemical pathways in&#xD;
      intracellular signaling, either by favoring or aggravating cell nephron damage. Recently,&#xD;
      numerous RAGE isoforms have been described as: soluble RAGE, which are devoid of cytoplasmic&#xD;
      domains, which bind to ligands that include AGEs and can antagonize intracellular signaling.&#xD;
      Therefore, the need to seek for alternative therapies like nutraceuticals is arising, mainly&#xD;
      due to its low toxicity and lower cost. Such is the case of green tea extract, which due to&#xD;
      its chemical composition, especially of flavonoids that generate antioxidant and&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory effects, In vivo and in clinical trials have shown that it could impact the&#xD;
      progression of the diabetic neuropathy , through the modulation of the biological process,&#xD;
      including molecular and biochemical pathways such as release of soluble RAGE.&#xD;

      The objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of the administration of green tea&#xD;
      extract on soluble RAGE and renal damage in patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, by means&#xD;
      of a clinical trial, double blind, with randomization and placebo control group. In male and&#xD;
      female population, with a diagnosis of Diabetes Mellitus type 2, under treatment with&#xD;
      hypoglycemic agents and / or insulin and kidney damage, 2 - 3a grade according to&#xD;
      classification of the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines and HbA1c&#xD;
      levels 9 - 12% who sign the letter of consent under information, from 35 to 65 years of age,&#xD;
      residents of the metropolitan area of Guadalajara.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients who meet the selection criteria and who sign their informed consent will be&#xD;
      given the clinical history, as well as anthropometric and laboratory determinations. Once&#xD;
      these values are known, the intervention will proceed with the research product, extract of&#xD;
      green tea 400 mg twice a day or placebo 400 mg twice a day, this will be according to the&#xD;
      technique of masking by the closed envelope technique for 12 weeks. Patients will be&#xD;
      evaluated at 30, 60 and 90 days of intervention, for attachment assessment, tolerability of&#xD;
      treatment, side effects and laboratory safety determinations. At the end of the 12 weeks of&#xD;
      the intervention, the anthropometric and laboratory determinations will be made again as well&#xD;
      as the determination of soluble RAGE by means of Elisa sandwich type, in serum obtained at&#xD;
      the beginning and at 12 weeks of intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The database will be developed in the statistical program Statistical software (SPSS) version&#xD;
      21.0. The qualitative variables will be expressed in frequencies and percentages, while the&#xD;
      quantitative variables will be expressed in means and standard deviations, the normality test&#xD;
      will be carried out through the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and, according to the result, it will&#xD;
      be decided for the analysis intra group perform paired t or Wilcoxon method and for&#xD;
      intergroup t student or Mann-Whitney U. A value of p ≤0.05 will be considered statistically&#xD;
      significant.&#xD;
