  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-site, cluster-randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness of&#xD;
      patient photographs displayed in electronic health record (EHR) systems to prevent&#xD;
      wrong-patient order errors. The study will be conducted at three academic medical centers&#xD;
      that utilize two different EHR systems. Because EHR systems have different functionality for&#xD;
      displaying patient photographs, two different study designs will be employed. In Allscripts&#xD;
      EHR, a 2-arm randomized trial will be conducted in which providers are randomized to view&#xD;
      order verification alerts with versus without patient photographs when placing electronic&#xD;
      orders. In Epic EHR, a 2x2 factorial trial will be conducted in which providers are&#xD;
      randomized to one of four conditions: 1) no photograph; 2) photograph displayed in the banner&#xD;
      only; 3) photograph displayed in a verification alert only; or 4) photograph displayed in the&#xD;
      banner and verification alert. The main hypothesis of this study is that displaying patient&#xD;
      photographs in the EHR will significantly reduce the frequency of wrong-patient order errors,&#xD;
      providing health systems with the evidence needed to adopt this safety practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will use the Wrong-Patient Retract-and-Reorder (RAR) measure, a valid, reliable, and&#xD;
      automated method for identifying wrong-patient orders, as the primary outcome measure. The&#xD;
      RAR measure identifies orders placed for a patient that are retracted within 10 minutes, and&#xD;
      then reordered by the same provider for a different patient within the next 10 minutes. These&#xD;
      are near-miss errors, self-caught by the provider before they reach the patient and cause&#xD;
      harm. In one study, the RAR measure identified more than 5,000 wrong-patient orders in 1&#xD;
      year, with a rate of 58 wrong-patient errors per 100,000 orders. Real-time telephone&#xD;
      interviews with clinicians determined that the RAR measure correctly identified near-miss&#xD;
      errors in 76.2% of cases. Thus, the RAR measure provides sufficient valid and reliable&#xD;
      outcome data for this study.&#xD;

      TThe main hypothesis of this study is that displaying patient photographs in electronic&#xD;
      health record (EHR) systems will significantly reduce the frequency of wrong-patient&#xD;
      electronic order errors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC AIMS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will test this hypothesis using a multi-site randomized controlled trial and&#xD;
      pursue the following specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Test the effectiveness of displaying patient photographs in EHR systems for preventing&#xD;
      wrong-patient orders, using the Retract-and-Reorder measure to identify the outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Identify characteristics of providers, patients, and orders that impact the&#xD;
      effectiveness of patient photographs displayed in an EHR system to prevent wrong-patient&#xD;
      orders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS Study Sites. The study will be conducted at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, Johns&#xD;
      Hopkins Medicine, and Montefiore Medical Center in two different electronic health record&#xD;
      (EHR) systems. Five NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital campuses that utilize Allscripts EHR will&#xD;
      be included: Milstein Hospital, Weill Cornell Medical Center, Morgan Stanley Children's&#xD;
      Hospital of New York, Lower Manhattan Hospital, and the Allen Hospital. In addition,&#xD;
      affiliated Ambulatory Care Network outpatient sites will be included. The effectiveness of&#xD;
      patient photographs in Epic will be tested at Johns Hopkins Hospital and three Montefiore&#xD;
      Medical Center campuses (Moses Hospital, Weiler Hospital, Wakefield Hospital).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design. The main hypothesis of this study is that displaying patient photographs in&#xD;
      an EHR system at the time of placing electronic orders will significantly decrease the&#xD;
      frequency of wrong-patient orders. Investigators will test this hypothesis with a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial using a 2-arm design in Allscripts and a 2 x 2 factorial design in Epic to&#xD;
      determine the optimal configuration of patient photographs. The design at the different sites&#xD;
      is based on the functionality of the EHR systems. In Allscripts, providers randomized to the&#xD;
      intervention arm will be shown a verification alert with a patient photograph at the time of&#xD;
      placing orders; providers randomized to the control arm will be shown the verification alert&#xD;
      with an avatar indicating the patient's sex. Epic has the functionality to display a patient&#xD;
      photograph in the banner at the top of the screen and in a verification alert at the time of&#xD;
      placing orders. Therefore, in Epic at Johns Hopkins and Montefiore, providers will be&#xD;
      randomized to one of four conditions: no photograph; photograph displayed in the banner only;&#xD;
      photograph displayed in the verification alert only; or photograph displayed in the banner&#xD;
      and alert.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Inclusion Criteria. In this study, all patients for whom an order is placed during&#xD;
      the study period at the study sites will be included in the analysis. At&#xD;
      NewYork-Presbyterian, all patients age 5 years and older will be included; at Johns Hopkins&#xD;
      Hospital and Montefiore Medical Center, all patients age 2 years and older will be included.&#xD;
      Obtaining a photograph at registration is standard procedure at the participating study&#xD;
      sites. Patients will not be required to provide written or oral consent to have their&#xD;
      photograph taken, as the photographs are used as part of routine care. However, patients or&#xD;
      their legal guardians may refuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Provider Inclusion Criteria. Any provider who places an electronic order can potentially&#xD;
      place an order on the wrong patient. Therefore all randomized providers who place an&#xD;
      electronic order at the study sites during the course of the study period will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization. In Allscripts at NewYork-Presbyterian, the EHR system has been configured such&#xD;
      that the first time a provider opens the Order Entry screen s/he will be automatically&#xD;
      randomized to either the control or intervention group (1:1 per the 2-arm design) using a&#xD;
      computerized randomization algorithm. In Epic, randomization will be performed using the same&#xD;
      randomization algorithm; however, providers will be manually assigned to the control or&#xD;
      intervention groups (1:1:1:1 per the 2 x 2 design) using the Grouper function in Epic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome. The primary outcome is the frequency of Wrong-Patient Retract-and-Reorder&#xD;
      (RAR) events, identified using the RAR measure and defined as an order that is placed for a&#xD;
      patient, retracted within 10 minutes of placing the order, and then reordered by the same&#xD;
      provider for a different patient within 10 minutes of the retraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clustering of Orders within Order Sessions. If a provider begins placing orders in the wrong&#xD;
      patient's record, there is the possibility that several such orders will be placed&#xD;
      consecutively and then all retracted together. Therefore, individual orders do not represent&#xD;
      independent opportunities for RAR events to occur. Rather, orders are clustered within order&#xD;
      sessions. An order session is defined as a series of orders placed by a provider on a single&#xD;
      patient that begins with opening that patient's order file and terminates when an order is&#xD;
      placed on another patient or after 60 minutes, whichever comes first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unit of Analysis. The unit of analysis will be the order session. Provider Level, Patient&#xD;
      Level, Order-Session Level, and Order Level Covariates. The data for this study will have a&#xD;
      nested, hierarchical structure with orders clustered within order sessions, and order&#xD;
      sessions clustered within providers. The analysis will account for this hierarchical&#xD;
      structure. Additional variables will be extracted from the electronic medical record,&#xD;
      including attributes of the provider (attending, resident, physician assistant, nurse&#xD;
      practitioner, or other), patient (age, race, ethnicity, sex, insurance status, unit), order&#xD;
      session (location, duration, number of orders), and order (medication, radiology, lab,&#xD;
      other). The presence or absence of a patient photograph will be tracked as an order level&#xD;
      covariate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Analysis. The unit of analysis is the order session. The dependent variable is the&#xD;
      proportion of order sessions that contain at least one order that was retracted and&#xD;
      re-ordered (an RAR event). Inference about effectiveness of the intervention will be based on&#xD;
      a Wald test of the coefficient of an interaction term between study-arm assignment and an&#xD;
      indicator of pre- or post-intervention time period. The estimate of effectiveness will be the&#xD;
      odds ratio (exponentiated coefficient) reported with its 95% confidence interval. With&#xD;
      cluster randomization at the provider level, patient and order session level attributes may&#xD;
      not be evenly distributed across groups. To reduce confounding bias, covariates at these&#xD;
      levels that are both differentially distributed in the study groups and associated with the&#xD;
      outcome will be included in this primary analysis. Provider-level covariates will likely be&#xD;
      balanced across study groups by randomization, and will be included in this primary analysis&#xD;
      only if descriptive statistics show otherwise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2-Arm RCT: Statistical Power/Sample Size. The overall design is a cluster randomized trial,&#xD;
      with order-session observations nested within randomized providers. The number of providers&#xD;
      (clusters) is a fixed attribute of the study site and will not be subject to investigator&#xD;
      control. Based on preliminary data, the assumption is that data on 12,000 providers will be&#xD;
      collected, with half randomized to each study arm. Over 2.5 years of observation, it is&#xD;
      estimated that an average of 5,000 order sessions per provider will be accrued, with a&#xD;
      coefficient of variation of 1.27. An intra-provider correlation of 0.001 for the outcome is&#xD;
      anticipated. The most recent available analyses from NYP suggest that the wrong-patient order&#xD;
      session rate (a weighted average of inpatient and outpatient rates) is about 130 per 100,000&#xD;
      order sessions. Using a two-tailed test at the 0.05 significance level, this will provide&#xD;
      &gt;90% power to detect a 25% reduction in the wrong-patient order-session rate in the&#xD;
      intervention group in the primary analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2x2 Factorial RCT: Statistical Power/Sample Size. A statistical power simulation was&#xD;
      conducted for the 2x2 factorial study of banner photographs (photo/no photo in banner) and&#xD;
      alert photographs (alert with photo/no alert). Based on prior studies and guidance from study&#xD;
      investigators, it is estimated that approximately 8,268 providers will be randomized in a&#xD;
      1:1:1:1 ratio to the four study arms (no photograph, photograph in the banner only,&#xD;
      photograph in the verification alert only, or photograph in the banner and verification&#xD;
      alert). Providers were assumed to generate an average of 74 order sessions per month, with a&#xD;
      Poisson distribution, and that data collection would continue for 1 year. Based on previous&#xD;
      studies, the variance component (in the log-odds metric) at the provider level would be 1.9&#xD;
      (corresponding to an intra-provider correlation of 0.52). The base rate of RAR events was&#xD;
      assumed to be 90 per 100,000 order sessions. Based on 400 simulations conducted under these&#xD;
      assumptions, it was determined that the study would have 91% power (95% CI 88%-94%) to detect&#xD;
      an odds ratio of 0.75 (i.e., 25% reduction in RAR events) for either single-photograph&#xD;
      intervention compared to no intervention. The power to detect an additional 15% reduction by&#xD;
      the combination of both photographs (compared to either alone) is 99.8% (95% CI 98.6%-99.9%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Missing Data. Due to the automatic functioning of the EHR, no missing data concerning&#xD;
      Retract-and-Reorder events, the mode of intervention group versus control group, or the&#xD;
      provider-level covariates is expected. There may be sporadic missing information regarding&#xD;
      the patient-level covariates. If any variables are missing for more than 1 record per 1,000&#xD;
      (after backfilling based on other records involving the same patient), analyses will be&#xD;
      extended to address this. The data will be presumed to be missing at random and will apply&#xD;
      multiple imputation with chained equations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interim Analysis. To safeguard against the possibility that the intervention actually worsens&#xD;
      (increases) the rate of RAR events, and to prevent unnecessary continuation of a study that&#xD;
      is already conclusive, a data safety monitoring committee will conduct one interim review of&#xD;
      the data. At the midpoint of the study, 50% of the data is expected to have been accrued.&#xD;
      Using the Lan-Demets alpha spending procedure with symmetric O'Brien-Fleming boundaries, the&#xD;
      stopping rule at the interim review will be a z-statistic of magnitude 3.0318 or greater. The&#xD;
      associated nominal P value is .0024. Combined with a final analysis using a critical z-value&#xD;
      of 1.9669 (nominal P = .0492), the overall alpha of 0.05 will be spent by the end of the&#xD;
      study. The effects of this interim analysis procedure on nominal statistical power (see&#xD;
      above) is negligible, less than 0.5 percentage points, so no adjustments to data collection&#xD;
      are needed to account for this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intention-to-Treat vs As-Treated Analyses. Some patients will likely decline to be&#xD;
      photographed or for whom photographs are not taken for various reasons. The photo capture&#xD;
      rate (the number of patients with a photograph divided by the number of patients with a visit&#xD;
      during the study period) will be monitored throughout the study period. In the primary&#xD;
      analyses for all trials, an intention-to-treat principle will be used, and these patients'&#xD;
      and sites' records will be included in the analysis as if they had been photographed and&#xD;
      participated. A second &quot;as-treated&quot; analysis will be performed limited to compliant patients&#xD;
      and sites, recognizing that such analyses may be subject to confounding by patient and site&#xD;
      factors.&#xD;

    <description>The Wrong-Patient Retract-and-Reorder (RAR) measure is an automated, validated, and reliable measure endorsed by the National Quality Forum (NQF #2723). The RAR measure identifies orders placed for a patient that are retracted within 10 minutes, and then placed by the same provider for a different patient within the next 10 minutes. These are near-miss errors, self-caught by the provider before they reach the patient and cause harm. In one study, the RAR measure identified more than 5,000 wrong-patient orders in 1 year, with a rate of 58 wrong-patient errors per 100,000 orders. Real-time telephone interviews with providers determined that the RAR measure correctly identified near-miss errors in 76.2% of cases). Thus, the RAR measure provides sufficient valid and reliable outcome data for this study.</description>
