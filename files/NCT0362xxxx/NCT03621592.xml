  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to investigate the effectiveness of Cutimed® Sorbact® (Study Device)&#xD;
      in modifying bacterial load in venous leg ulcers (VLU).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Design: This is an exploratory study in a single center, observer masked, active control,&#xD;
      randomized trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, 30 subjects with VLU who have persistent wounds and have been previously treated&#xD;
      with silver based therapy will be 1:1 randomized to receive up to four applications over up&#xD;
      to four weeks of Study Device or Comparator (silver impregnated contact layer dressing -&#xD;
      Acticoat®) with 2 weeks follow up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes: Primary outcome is the change in bacterial load compared to baseline. Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes: healing rate, complete healing at 6 weeks, pain, quality of life (QOL) measurements&#xD;
      and adverse events.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Due to the nature of the study and products, investigator blinding is unrealistic and subject blinding is unlikely. Research staff will avoid naming the dressing or suggesting the assignment to the subjects. However, an independent monitor with experience in treating wounds will be blinded to the treatment assignment and will confirm healing outcomes based on images.</masking_description>
