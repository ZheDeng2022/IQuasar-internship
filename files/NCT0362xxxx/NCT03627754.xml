             risk associated with study participation or investigational product administration or&#xD;
             may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the&#xD;
             investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for entry into this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Additional Exclusion Criteria for Subjects with Normal Hepatic Function:&#xD;
&#xD;
        In addition, subjects in the normal hepatic function cohort (Cohort 3) presenting with any&#xD;

             (diastolic), the BP should be repeated two more times and the average of the three BP&#xD;
             values should be used to determine the subject's eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. 12-lead ECG demonstrating QTcF &gt;450 msec or a QRS interval &gt;120 msec at Screening. If&#xD;
             QTcF exceeds 450 msec, or QRS exceeds 120 msec, the ECG should be repeated two more&#xD;
             times and the average of the three QTcF or QRS values should be used to determine the&#xD;
             subject's eligibility.&#xD;

             nonprescription medications that are not believed to affect subject safety or the&#xD;
             overall results of the study may be permitted on a case by case basis following&#xD;
             approval by the sponsor. Herbal supplements and hormone replacement therapy must have&#xD;

             including hepatitis B surface antigen (HepBsAg), hepatitis B core antibody (HepBcAb),&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Other clinically significant disease that contraindicates study drug or that may&#xD;
             affect the PK of glasdegib (stable, chronic, controlled disorders such as hypertension&#xD;

             Classification criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. History of gastrointestinal hemorrhage either due to esophageal varices or peptic&#xD;
             ulcers less than one month prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Any clinically significant laboratory abnormality except for those parameters&#xD;
             influenced by hepatic impairment. Due to potential for alteration of hepatic function&#xD;
             in renally impaired patients, subjects must have an estimated glomerular filtration&#xD;
             rate (eGFR) corrected for their body surface area of =&gt; 75 mL/min based on the&#xD;
             Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation, with a single repeat permitted&#xD;

             at least 5 minutes of supine rest. If initial BP is =&gt; 160 mm Hg (systolic) or =&gt; 90&#xD;
             mm Hg (diastolic), the BP should be repeated two more times and the average of the&#xD;
             three BP values should be used to determine the subject's eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Screening supine 12-lead ECG demonstrating QTcF &gt;470 msec or a QRS interval &gt;120 msec.&#xD;
             If initial QTcF exceeds 470 msec, or QRS exceeds 120 msec, the ECG should be repeated&#xD;
             two more times and the average of the three QTcF or QRS values should be used to&#xD;
             determine the subject's eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Use of food, drugs, or dietary supplements that may affect the PK of glasdegib within&#xD;
             7 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the dose of glasdegib. Use of&#xD;
             medications that are not believed to affect subject safety and are medically necessary&#xD;
             for the treatment and maintenance of hepatic disease and other pre-existing and/or&#xD;
             concurrent stable comorbid conditions are permitted with approval by the sponsor.&#xD;
