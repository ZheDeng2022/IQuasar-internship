             advance (which must be concurrent treatment), and management of random and target&#xD;
             lesions should be performed after successful treatment of non-target lesion(s);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The pre-operative diameter stenosis must be either ≥ 70% or ≥ 50% with ischemia;&#xD;
             (visually measured)&#xD;
