  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      B7451014 is a Phase 3 study to investigate PF-04965842 in patients aged 12 years and over&#xD;
      with a minimum body weight of 40 kg who have moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. Subjects&#xD;
      responding well to an initial open-label 12 week treatment of PF-04965842 (200 mg) taken&#xD;
      orally once daily (QD) will be identified and randomized in a double-blind manner to receive&#xD;
      200 mg QD PF-04965842, 100 mg QD PF-04965842, or QD placebo. Efficacy and safety of 2 doses&#xD;
      of PF-04965842 will be evaluated relative to placebo over 40 weeks. Subjects experiencing&#xD;
      significant worsening of their symptoms, i.e., protocol-defined flare, enter 12 weeks rescue&#xD;
      treatment and receive 200 mg PF-04965842 together with a marketed topical medicine. Eligible&#xD;
      patients will have the option to enter a long-term extension study after completing the&#xD;
      initial 12 week treatment, the 12 week rescue treatment, and the 40 week blinded treatment.&#xD;

      Responder criteria for randomization at week 12 are defined as a) achieving an IGA of clear&#xD;
      (0) or almost clear (1) (on a 5 point scale), b) a reduction from IGA baseline of 2 or more&#xD;
      points, and c) reaching an EASI-75 response compared to baseline. Flare requiring rescue&#xD;
      treatment is defined as a loss of at least 50% of the EASI response at Week 12 and an IGA&#xD;
      score of 2 or higher.&#xD;

    <time_frame>From Day 1 of up to Week 40 of double blind period</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants with loss of response requiring rescue treatment during double blind period was determined. Loss of response denoted as flare and was define as a loss of at least 50% of EASI total score at Week 12 and with an IGA score of 2 or higher. EASI quantifies severity of participant's atopic dermatitis (AD) based on both severity of lesion clinical signs and % of body surface area (BSA) affected. EASI is a composite scoring by AD clinical evaluator of degree of erythema, induration/papulation, excoriation, and lichenification for each of 4 body regions. EASI total score range from 0.0 to 72.0, with higher scores representing greater severity of AD. IGA assesses severity of AD on 5-point scale (0 to 4, higher scores = more severity), reflecting global consideration of erythema, induration and scaling. Where, 0 = clear; 1 = almost clear; 2 = mild; 3 = moderate and 4 = severe.</description>

A: rule of 9 used to calculate BSA affected by AD as % of whole BSA for each body region- head and neck 9%; upper limbs 9% each; lower limbs 18% each; anterior trunk 18%; back 18%; genitals 1%. Score of each body region added to determine A (0-100). B: severity of each sign (erythema; edema; oozing; excoriation; skin thickening; dryness) was assessed as none (0), mild (1), moderate (2), severe (3). Severity scores added to give B (0-18). C: pruritus and sleep loss, each were scored by participant/caregiver using VAS where, 0=no itch/no sleep loss and 10=worst imaginable itch/sleep loss, higher scores=worse symptoms. Scores for itch and sleep loss added to give 'C' (0-20). SCORAD calculated as: A/5+7*B/2+C; range (0-103); higher values=worse outcome.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Pruritus and Symptoms Assessment for Atopic Dermatitis (PSAAD) Score at Weeks 12, 16, 28, 40 and 52: Double-blind Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 12, 16, 28, 40 and 52</time_frame>
    <description>PSAAD is a daily participant reported symptom electronic diary. Participants rated their symptoms of AD over the past 24 hours, using 11 items (itchy skin, painful skin, dry skin, flaky skin, cracked skin, bumpy skin, red skin, discolored skin [darker or lighter], bleeding from skin, seeping or oozing fluid from skin [other than blood], and skin swelling). Participants had to think about all the areas of their body affected by their skin condition and chose the number that best described their experience for each of the 11 items, from 0 (no symptoms) to 10 (extreme symptoms), higher scores signified worse skin condition. Total PSAAD score = arithmetic mean of 11 items, 0 (no symptoms) to 10 (extreme symptoms), where higher score = worse skin condition.</description>

          <title>PF-04965842 200 mg OL</title>
          <description>Participants received 12 weeks induction treatment of 200 milligram (mg) oral tablets (each tablet of 100 mg) PF-04965842 once daily (QD) during an OL run-in period. Responders at the end of the 12-week OL run-in period entered the 40 week, double-blind (DB), maintenance treatment period. Responder criteria was defined as a) achieving an Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) of clear (0) or almost clear (1) (on a 5-point scale), b) a reduction from IGA baseline of greater than or equal to (&gt;= 2) points, and c) reaching an Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI)-75 response compared to baseline score. Baseline score was the IGA score and EASI score obtained prior to dosing on Day 1. Non-responders had a choice to enroll into the PF-04965842 Long Term Extension (LTE) study B7451015 (NCT03422822) otherwise, they were permanently discontinued from treatment and were followed-up for 4-week in this study.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Loss of Response: Double-blind (DB) Period</title>
        <description>Percentage of participants with loss of response requiring rescue treatment during double blind period was determined. Loss of response denoted as flare and was define as a loss of at least 50% of EASI total score at Week 12 and with an IGA score of 2 or higher. EASI quantifies severity of participant's atopic dermatitis (AD) based on both severity of lesion clinical signs and % of body surface area (BSA) affected. EASI is a composite scoring by AD clinical evaluator of degree of erythema, induration/papulation, excoriation, and lichenification for each of 4 body regions. EASI total score range from 0.0 to 72.0, with higher scores representing greater severity of AD. IGA assesses severity of AD on 5-point scale (0 to 4, higher scores = more severity), reflecting global consideration of erythema, induration and scaling. Where, 0 = clear; 1 = almost clear; 2 = mild; 3 = moderate and 4 = severe.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) Response &gt;=50% Improvement From Baseline at Weeks 12, 16, 28, 40 and 52: Double-blind Period</title>
        <description>EASI quantifies severity of participant's AD (excluded scalp, palms, soles) based on severity of AD clinical signs and % of BSA affected. Severity of clinical signs of AD (erythema [E], induration/papulation [I], excoriation [Ex] and lichenification [L]) was scored separately for each of 4 body regions (head and neck [h], upper limbs [u], trunk [t] [including axillae and groin] and lower limbs [l] [including buttocks]) on 4-point scale: 0 = absent; 1 = mild; 2 = moderate; 3 = severe. EASI area score was based upon % BSA with AD in body region: 0 (0%), 1 (&gt;0 to &lt;10%), 2 (10 to &lt;30%), 3 (30 to &lt;50%), 4 (50 to &lt;70%), 5 (70 to &lt;90%) and 6 (90 to 100%). Total EASI score = 0.1*Ah*(Eh+Ih+Exh+Lh) + 0.2*Au*(Eu+Iu+ExU+Lu) + 0.3*At*(Et+It+Ext+Lt) + 0.4*Al*(El+Il+Exl+Ll); where A = area score. Total EASI score ranged from 0.0 to 72.0, higher scores = greater severity of AD.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) Response &gt;=75% Improvement From Baseline at Weeks 12, 16, 28, 40 and 52: Double-blind Period</title>
        <description>EASI quantifies severity of participant's AD (excluded scalp, palms, soles) based on severity of AD clinical signs and % of BSA affected. Severity of clinical signs of AD (erythema, induration/papulation, excoriation and lichenification) scored separately for each of 4 body regions (head and neck, upper limbs, trunk [including axillae and groin] and lower limbs [including buttocks]) on 4-point scale: 0 = absent; 1 = mild; 2 = moderate; 3 = severe. EASI area score was based upon % BSA with AD in body region: 0 (0%), 1 (&gt;0 to &lt;10%), 2 (10 to &lt;30%), 3 (30 to &lt;50%), 4 (50 to &lt;70%), 5 (70 to &lt;90%) and 6 (90 to 100%). Total EASI score = 0.1*Ah*(Eh+Ih+Exh+Lh) + 0.2*Au*(Eu+Iu+ExU+Lu) + 0.3*At*(Et+It+Ext+Lt) + 0.4*Al*(El+Il+Exl+Ll). Total EASI score ranged from 0.0 to 72.0, higher scores = greater severity of AD.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) Response &gt;=90% Improvement From Baseline at Weeks 12, 16, 28, 40 and 52: Double-blind Period</title>
        <description>EASI quantifies severity of participant's AD (excluded scalp, palms, soles) based on severity of AD clinical signs and % of BSA affected. Severity of clinical signs of AD (erythema, induration/papulation, excoriation and lichenification) scored separately for each of 4 body regions (head and neck, upper limbs, trunk [including axillae and groin] and lower limbs [including buttocks]) on 4-point scale: 0 = absent; 1 = mild; 2 = moderate; 3 = severe. EASI area score was based upon % BSA with AD in body region: 0 (0%), 1 (&gt;0 to &lt;10%), 2 (10 to &lt;30%), 3 (30 to &lt;50%), 4 (50 to &lt;70%), 5 (70 to &lt;90%) and 6 (90 to 100%). Total EASI score = 0.1*Ah*(Eh+Ih+Exh+Lh) + 0.2*Au*(Eu+Iu+ExU+Lu) + 0.3*At*(Et+It+Ext+Lt) + 0.4*Al*(El+Il+Exl+Ll). Total EASI score ranged from 0.0 to 72.0, higher scores=greater severity of AD.</description>

        <description>EASI quantifies severity of participant's AD (excluded scalp, palms, soles) based on severity of AD clinical signs and % of BSA affected. Severity of clinical signs of AD (erythema, induration/papulation, excoriation and lichenification) scored separately for each of 4 body regions (head and neck, upper limbs, trunk [including axillae and groin] and lower limbs [including buttocks]) on 4-point scale: 0= absent; 1= mild; 2= moderate; 3= severe. EASI area score was based upon % BSA with AD in body region: 0 (0%), 1 (&gt;0 to &lt;10%), 2 (10 to &lt;30%), 3 (30 to &lt;50%), 4 (50 to &lt;70%), 5 (70 to &lt;90%) and 6 (90 to 100%). Total EASI score =0.1*Ah*(Eh+Ih+Exh+Lh) + 0.2*Au*(Eu+Iu+ExU+Lu) + 0.3*At*(Et+It+Ext+Lt) + 0.4*Al*(El+Il+Exl+Ll). Total EASI score ranged from 0.0 to 72.0, higher scores=greater severity of AD.</description>

        <description>4 body regions evaluated: head and neck, upper limbs, trunk (including axillae, groin/genitals), lower limbs (including buttocks) excluding scalp, palms, soles. BSA calculated by handprint method. Number (No) of handprints (size of participant's hand with fingers in closed position) fitting in affected area of a body region was estimated. Maximum No of handprints were 10, 20, 30, 40 for head and neck, upper limbs, trunk, and lower limbs respectively. Surface area (SA) of body region equivalent to 1 handprint: 1 handprint=10% for head and neck, 5% for upper limbs, 3.33% for trunk and 2.5% for lower limbs. %Change BSA for a body region was calculated as=total No of handprints in a body region* %SA equivalent to 1 handprint. %BSA for an individual: arithmetic mean of %BSA of all 4 body regions, ranged from 0-100%, higher values=greater AD severity.</description>

Score of each body region added to determine A (0-100). B: severity of each sign (erythema; edema; oozing; excoriation; skin thickening; dryness) was assessed as none (0), mild (1), moderate (2), severe (3); severity scores added to give B (0-18). C: pruritus and sleep loss, each of these 2 were scored by participant/caregiver using VAS where, 0=no itch/no sleep loss and 10=worst imaginable itch/sleep loss, higher scores=worse symptoms. Scores for itch and sleep loss added to give 'C' (0-20). SCORAD calculated as: A/5+7*B/2+C; range (0-103); higher values=worse outcome.</description>

        <description>SCORAD: scoring index for AD combining extent (A), severity (B), subjective symptoms (C). A: rule of 9 used to calculate BSA affected by AD as % of whole BSA for each body region-head and neck 9%; upper limbs 9% each; lower limbs 18% each; anterior trunk 18%; back 18%; genitals 1%. Score of each body region added to determine A (0-100). B: severity of each sign (erythema; edema; oozing; excoriation; skin thickening; dryness) was assessed as none (0), mild (1), moderate (2), severe (3). Severity scores added to give B (0-18). C: pruritus and sleep loss, each were scored by participant/caregiver using VAS where, 0=no itch/no sleep loss and 10=worst imaginable itch/sleep loss, higher scores=worse symptoms. Scores for itch and sleep loss added to give 'C' (0-20). SCORAD calculated as: A/5+7*B/2+C; range (0-103); higher values=worse outcome.</description>

        <description>SCORAD: scoring index for AD combining extent (A), severity (B), subjective symptoms (C). A: rule of 9 used to calculate BSA affected by AD as % of whole BSA for each body region- head and neck 9%; upper limbs 9% each; lower limbs 18% each; anterior trunk 18%; back 18%; genitals 1%. Score of each body region added to determine A (0-100). B: severity of each sign (erythema; edema; oozing; excoriation; skin thickening; dryness) was assessed as none (0), mild (1), moderate (2), severe (3). Severity scores added to give B (0-18). C: pruritus and sleep loss, each were scored by participant/caregiver using VAS where, 0=no itch/no sleep loss and 10=worst imaginable itch/sleep loss, higher scores=worse symptoms. Scores for itch and sleep loss added to give 'C' (0-20). SCORAD calculated as: A/5+7*B/2+C; range (0-103); higher values=worse outcome.</description>

        <description>SCORAD: scoring index for AD combining extent (A), severity (B), subjective symptoms (C). A: rule of 9 used to calculate BSA affected by AD as % of whole BSA for each body region- head and neck 9%; upper limbs 9% each; lower limbs 18% each; anterior trunk 18%; back 18%; genitals 1%. Score of each body region added to determine A (0-100). B: severity of each sign (erythema; edema; oozing; excoriation; skin thickening; dryness) was assessed as none (0), mild (1), moderate (2), severe (3). Severity scores added to give B (0-18). C: pruritus and sleep loss, each were scored by participant/caregiver using VAS where, 0=no itch/no sleep loss and 10=worst imaginable itch/sleep loss, higher scores=worse symptoms. Scores for itch and sleep loss added to give 'C' (0-20). SCORAD calculated as: A/5+7*B/2+C; range (0-103); higher values=worse outcome.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Rescue Baseline in Total Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) Score at Rescue Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12: Rescue Period</title>
        <description>EASI quantifies severity of participant's AD (excluded scalp, palms, soles) based on severity of AD clinical signs and % of BSA affected. Severity of clinical signs of AD (erythema, induration/papulation, excoriation and lichenification) scored separately for each of 4 body regions (head and neck, upper limbs, trunk [including axillae and groin] and lower limbs [including buttocks]) on 4-point scale: 0= absent; 1= mild; 2= moderate; 3= severe. EASI area score was based upon % BSA with AD in body region: 0 (0%), 1 (&gt;0 to &lt;10%), 2 (10 to &lt;30%), 3 (30 to &lt;50%), 4 (50 to &lt;70%), 5 (70 to &lt;90%) and 6 (90 to 100%). Total EASI score =0.1*Ah*(Eh+Ih+Exh+Lh) + 0.2*Au*(Eu+Iu+ExU+Lu) + 0.3*At*(Et+It+Ext+Lt) + 0.4*Al*(El+Il+Exl+Ll). Total EASI score ranged from 0.0 to 72.0, higher scores=greater severity of AD.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Rescue Baseline in Percent Body Surface Area (BSA) at Rescue Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12: Rescue Period</title>
        <description>4 body regions were evaluated: head and neck, upper limbs, trunk (including axillae and groin/genitals) and lower limbs (including buttocks). Scalp, palms and soles were excluded. BSA was calculated using handprint method. Number of handprints (size of participant's hand with fingers in a closed position) fitting in affected area of a body region was estimated. Maximum number of handprints were 10 for head and neck, 20 for upper limbs, 30 for trunk and 40 for lower limbs. Surface area of body region equivalent to 1 handprint: 1 handprint was equal to 10% for head and neck, 5% for upper limbs, 3.33% for trunk and 2.5% for lower limbs. Overall % BSA for an individual % BSA of all 4 body regions, ranged from 0 to 100%, with higher values representing greater severity of AD.</description>

A: rule of 9 used to calculate BSA affected by AD as % of whole BSA for each body region- head and neck 9%; upper limbs 9% each; lower limbs 18% each; anterior trunk 18%; back 18%; genitals 1%. Score of each body region added to determine A (0-100). B: severity of each sign (erythema; edema; oozing; excoriation; skin thickening; dryness) was assessed as none (0), mild (1), moderate (2), severe (3). Severity scores added to give B (0-18). C: pruritus and sleep loss, each were scored by participant/caregiver using VAS where, 0=no itch/no sleep loss and 10=worst imaginable itch/sleep loss, higher scores=worse symptoms. Scores for itch and sleep loss added to give 'C' (0-20). SCORAD calculated as: A/5+7*B/2+C; range (0-103); higher values=worse outcome.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With 75% Improvement in Scoring Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) From Rescue Baseline at Rescue Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12: Rescue Period</title>
        <description>SCORAD: scoring index for AD combining extent (A), severity (B), subjective symptoms (C). A: rule of 9 used to calculate BSA affected by AD as % of whole BSA for each body region- head and neck 9%; upper limbs 9% each; lower limbs 18% each; anterior trunk 18%; back 18%; genitals 1%. Score of each body region added to determine A (0-100). B: severity of each sign (erythema; edema; oozing; excoriation; skin thickening; dryness) was assessed as none (0), mild (1), moderate (2), severe (3). Severity scores added to give B (0-18). C: pruritus and sleep loss, each were scored by participant/caregiver using VAS where, 0=no itch/no sleep loss and 10=worst imaginable itch/sleep loss, higher scores=worse symptoms. Scores for itch and sleep loss added to give 'C' (0-20). SCORAD calculated as: A/5+7*B/2+C; range (0-103); higher values=worse outcome.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) Score for Adults at Weeks 12, 16, 28, 40 and 52: Double-blind Period</title>
        <description>DLQI was a 10-item questionnaire that measures the impact of skin disease. Each question was evaluated on a 4-point scale (range 0 to 3) where, 0 = not at all, 1= a little, 2= a lot, 3= very much, where higher scores indicated more impact on quality of life. Scores from all 10 questions were added up to give DLQI total score range from 0 (not at all) to 30 (very much). Higher scores indicated more impact on quality of life of participants.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI) Score for Adolescents at Weeks 12, 16, 28, 40 and 52: Double-blind Period</title>
        <description>CDLQI is a 10-item questionnaire that measures the impact of skin disease on adolescents (aged 12-17 years) quality of life over the last week. Each question was evaluated on a 4-point scale (range 0 to 3) where, 0 = not at all , 1 = only a little, 2 = quite a lot, 3 = very much, where higher scores indicated more impact on quality of life. Scores from all 10 questions were added up to give CDLQI total score range from 0 (not at all) to 30 (very much). Higher scores indicated more impact on quality of life of children.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) - Anxiety Scale at Weeks 12, 16, 28, 40 and 52: Double-blind Period</title>
        <description>HADS: participant rated 14-item questionnaire. HADS consisted of 2 subscales: HADS-Anxiety (HADS-A) scale and HADS-Depression (HADS-D) scale, both of these subscales comprised of 7 items each. Each item was rated on a 4-point scale, score range from 0 to 3, where higher scores indicates more anxiety/depression symptoms. HADS-A assesses state of generalized anxiety (anxious mood, restlessness, anxious thoughts, panic attacks). HADS-A: sum of all 7 items resulted in score range of 0 (no presence of anxiety) to 21 (severe feeling of anxiety); higher score indicating greater severity of anxiety.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) - Depression Scale at Weeks 12, 16, 28, 40 and 52: Double-blind Period</title>
        <description>HADS: participant rated 14-item questionnaire. HADS consisted of 2 subscales: HADS-A scale and HADS-D scale, both of these subscales comprised of 7 items each. Each item was rated on a 4-point scale, score range from 0 to 3, where higher scores indicates more anxiety/depression symptoms. HADS-D assesses state of lost interest and diminished pleasure response (lowering of hedonic tone). HADS-D: sum of all 7 items resulted in score range of 0 (no presence of depression) to 21 (severe feeling of depression); higher score indicating greater severity of depression symptoms.</description>

        <description>POEM was a 7-item participant reported outcome (PRO) measure used to assess the impact of AD (dryness, itching, flaking, cracking, sleep loss, bleeding and weeping) over the past week. Each item scored as following: no days = 0, 1-2 days = 1, 3-4 days = 2, 5-6 days = 3 and, every day = 4. The total POEM score ranges from 0 to 28, where higher score indicated greater severity.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Pruritus and Symptoms Assessment for Atopic Dermatitis (PSAAD) Score at Weeks 12, 16, 28, 40 and 52: Double-blind Period</title>
        <description>PSAAD is a daily participant reported symptom electronic diary. Participants rated their symptoms of AD over the past 24 hours, using 11 items (itchy skin, painful skin, dry skin, flaky skin, cracked skin, bumpy skin, red skin, discolored skin [darker or lighter], bleeding from skin, seeping or oozing fluid from skin [other than blood], and skin swelling). Participants had to think about all the areas of their body affected by their skin condition and chose the number that best described their experience for each of the 11 items, from 0 (no symptoms) to 10 (extreme symptoms), higher scores signified worse skin condition. Total PSAAD score = arithmetic mean of 11 items, 0 (no symptoms) to 10 (extreme symptoms), where higher score = worse skin condition.</description>

          <description>Participants received 12 weeks induction treatment of 200 mg oral tablets (each tablet of 100 mg) PF-04965842 QD during an OL run-in period. Responders at the end of the 12-week open-label run-in period entered the 40 weeks, DB, maintenance treatment period. Responder criteria was defined as a) achieving an IGA of clear (0) or almost clear (1) (on a 5-point scale), b) a reduction from IGA baseline of &gt;= 2 points, and c) reaching an EASI-75 response compared to baseline score. Baseline score was the IGA score and EASI score obtained prior to dosing on Day 1. Non-responders had a choice to enroll into the PF-04965842 LTE study B7451015 (NCT03422822) otherwise, they were permanently discontinued from treatment and were followed-up for 4-week in this study.</description>
