  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will examine how electrical stimulation of vagus nerve (i.e. nerve around the outer&#xD;
      ear) from the skin surface during motor training influences a brain hormone (called&#xD;
      norepinephrine), brain activity, and motor performance.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Motor function is compromised with advanced age, and motor impairment is involved in various&#xD;
      neuromotor injuries and disorders including stroke, spinal cord injury, amputation, and&#xD;
      aging. Development of effective interventions for facilitating neuromotor adaptation is&#xD;
      essential for accelerating or augmenting rehabilitation outcomes in the control of impaired&#xD;
      limbs. The ultimate goal of the study is to find non-pharmacological and non-invasive&#xD;
      neuromodulating interventions for enhancing the rehabilitation outcomes that may be applied&#xD;
      to individuals with impaired motor function. In rats, implanted afferent vagus nerve&#xD;
      stimulation paired with motor training enhanced neuromotor adaptation and motor recovery most&#xD;
      likely through increased release of central neuromodulators that originate from the&#xD;
      brainstem. The investigators propose to translate the findings in rats into humans by&#xD;
      applying vagus nerve stimulation noninvasively. Transcutaneous VNS (tVNS) can noninvasively&#xD;
      activate the brainstem including locus coeruleus, where norepinephrine (i.e. neuromodulator)&#xD;
      is synthesized. However, it is unknown whether tVNS leads to increasing neuromodulators and&#xD;
      facilitating neuromotor adaptations when combined with motor training in humans. With&#xD;
      potential applicability of this novel intervention for facilitating neuromotor adaptation to&#xD;
      various clinical human populations in future scope, it is essential to start with the basic&#xD;
      understanding about the effect of tVNS on the neuromotor system and training-induced&#xD;
      adaptation in neuromotor behavior in non-disabled humans. The overarching hypothesis is that&#xD;
      an application of tVNS increases central norepinephrine and facilitates training-induced&#xD;
      neuromotor adaptations in humans. The specific aim is to examine the effect of tVNS on&#xD;
      central norepinephrine and training-induced neuromotor adaptations in humans. The effect of&#xD;
      applying tVNS concurrently to visuomotor training will be investigated by comparing the&#xD;
      changes in central norepinephrine and changes in the visuomotor skill and corticospinal&#xD;
      excitability due to training with and without tVNS (sham) in non-disabled humans. The&#xD;
      investigators expect that subjects with concurrent tVNS during training show greater&#xD;
      increases in the visuomotor skill and corticospinal excitability after training. The&#xD;
      investigators also expect that tVNS increases central norepinephrine, and the amount of&#xD;
      neuromotor adaptations due to training is associated with that of tVNS-induced increase in&#xD;
      central norepinephrine. These expected findings will be the first evidence on the efficacy of&#xD;
      concurrent tVNS with motor training for upregulating central norepinephrine and facilitating&#xD;
      training-induced neuromotor adaptations in humans. They will open new scientific and clinical&#xD;
      fields of study that will lead to the creation of motor rehabilitation paired with tVNS that&#xD;
      can enhance rehabilitation outcomes in individuals with motor impairment. Demonstration of&#xD;
      associated changes between central norepinephrine and neuromotor adaptations due to tVNS in&#xD;
      non-disabled humans is a necessary step for applying tVNS to rehabilitation with the&#xD;
      understanding of the underlying mechanism and for potentially using central norepinephrine as&#xD;
      a predictor of tVNS efficacy in rehabilitation.&#xD;
