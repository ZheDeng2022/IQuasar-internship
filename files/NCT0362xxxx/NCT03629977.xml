    <textblock>
      Background: Severe acute kidney injury (AKI) among critically ill patients is sometimes&#xD;
      treated with renal replacement therapy (RRT), and in Sweden continuous RRT (CRRT) is the&#xD;
      dominant modality used in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The optimal timing of renal replacement therapy (RRT) initiation in critically ill&#xD;
           patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) is unknown&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No consensus to guide clinical practice on this issue&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lack of consistency regarding outcome measurements; should we look at morbidity or&#xD;
           mortality?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Wide variability in the timing of RRT initiation in the intensive care unit (ICU)&#xD;
           population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: This is an important knowledge gap in the support of critically ill patients with&#xD;
      AKI and we hypothesize that early initiation of RRT is beneficial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The present study aims to test this hypothesis by using a large scale high&#xD;
      resolution intensive care database, the Clinisoft repository. In this database, we have&#xD;
      information on &gt;60 000 patients from three different hospitals and five ICUs, during the&#xD;
      years 2005 up until today. The repository will be crossmatched, using the unique Swedish&#xD;
      national ID number, with hospital records; to gather information on preexisting illnesses,&#xD;
      chronic medication and post-ICU outcomes. It is likely that over 5%, more than 3000 patients,&#xD;
      have been treated with RRT. We will categorize these patients into &quot;early&quot; and &quot;late&quot; groups&#xD;
      using both biomarker data and clinical data. Importantly, early and late RRT can be&#xD;
      categorized using biomarkers, like urea and creatinine; using degree of fluid accumulation,&#xD;
      by level of pH in blood and just by using hours-days after ICU admission. All possible&#xD;
      definitions of early/late RRT initiation can be tested in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes: Our primary outcome is 90 day mortality. Secondary outcomes include: mortality at&#xD;
      30, 60, 180 and 365 days. Two- and three year mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Morbidity, measured as end-stage renal disease (ESRD) for 90-day survivors. ICU length of&#xD;
      stay, hospital length of stay.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Optimal timing of renal replacement therapy (RRT) initiation in critically ill patients&#xD;
           with acute kidney injury (AKI) is unknown&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No consensus guides clinical practice on this issue&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Conflicting results from randomized controlled trials&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lack of consistency regarding outcome; should we look at morbidity or mortality?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Wide variability in the timing of RRT initiation in this population&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is an important knowledge gap in the support of critically ill patients with AKI&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most previous studies have pointed to benefits of early RRT:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The SOAP study (Payen 2008) enrolled&gt; 3100 patients and 278 patients required RRT - in&#xD;
           these patients, &quot;early RRT&quot; was defined as RRT initiation within two days of ICU&#xD;
           admission while &quot;late RRT&quot; was defined as RRT initiation occurring thereafter. The early&#xD;
           RRT group was significantly sicker, including higher SAPS II/SOFA scores, greater need&#xD;
           for mechanical ventilation, and lower urine output compared to the late RRT group.&#xD;
           Despite this (and without adjustment for these clinical differences at baseline), both&#xD;
           ICU and hospital mortality along with ICU length of stay were significantly lower in the&#xD;
           early RRT group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A secondary analysis of the FINNAKI (Vaara 2014) studied 239 critically ill patients&#xD;
           with acute kidney injury treated with renal replacement therapy. The exposure was timing&#xD;
           relative to evidence of developing ≥ 1 &quot;conventional&quot; indications, and three groups were&#xD;
           defined. A) &quot;Pre-emptive&quot; - no conventional indication. B) &quot;Classic - urgent&quot; - renal&#xD;
           replacement therapy started &lt; 12 hr of indication. C) &quot;Classic - delayed&quot; - renal&#xD;
           replacement therapy started ≥ 12 hr after indication. The analysis was stratified by&#xD;
           group + propensity-matched analysis of &quot;pre-emptive&quot; to non-renal replacement therapy&#xD;
           treated. 90-Day Mortality results were quite striking.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Pre-emptive renal replacement therapy vs. Classic renal replacement therapy 30% vs. 49%;&#xD;
           OR 2.05; 95%, CI 1.0-4.1 Classic Urgent vs. Classic Delayed 39% vs. 68%; OR 3.85; 95%&#xD;
           CI, 1.5-10.2 Pre-emptive vs. no renal replacement therapy (67% matched) 27% vs. 49%&#xD;
           (diff 22.4%; 95% CI, 7.5-35.9)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Karvellas (2011) performed a meta-analysis comparing early vs late initiation of renal&#xD;
           replacement therapy. 15 unique studies (2 randomised, 4 prospective cohort, 9&#xD;
           retrospective cohort) out of 1,494 citations. The overall methodological quality was&#xD;
           low. Early, compared with late therapy, was associated with a significant improvement in&#xD;
           28-day mortality (odds ratio (OR) 0.45; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.28 to 0.72).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Leite (2013) performed a study of 150 patients with AKIN stage 3. Mortality was lower in&#xD;
           the early renal replacement therapy group (51.5 vs. 77.9%, P = 0.001). After achieving&#xD;
           balance between the groups using a propensity score, there was a significant 30.5 (95%&#xD;
           confidence interval [CI] 14.4 to 45.2%, P = 0.002) relative decrease of mortality in the&#xD;
           early renal replacement therapy group. Moreover, patients on the early renal replacement&#xD;
           therapy group had lower duration of mechanical ventilation, time on renal replacement&#xD;
           therapy and a trend to lower intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Shiao (2012) looked at 648 postoperative renal replacement therapy cases. Definitions&#xD;
           were: early (EG, ≦1 day), intermediate (IG, 2-3 days), and late (LG, ≧4 days) groups.&#xD;
           The in-hospital mortality rate censored at 180 day was defined as the endpoint. A&#xD;
           U-shaped curve was found, indicating that intermediate start of renal replacement&#xD;
           therapy was beneficial in this cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The two RCTs; the AKIKI and ELAIN-studies (2016) from NEJM and JAMA report conflicting&#xD;
           results. AKIKI showed no benefit with early initiation of renal replacement therapy but&#xD;
           ELAIN did. Complicating matters were the fact that AKIKI dosing was unknown, and IHD was&#xD;
           used in around 50% of those patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are ongoing randomized controlled trials, but STARRT-AKI (see #2) have released&#xD;
      feasibility data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. I.D.E.A.L.-I.C.U. (NCT01682590) (start Mar 2012): - RCT of &quot;early&quot; (within 12 hrs of&#xD;
           RIFLE-F) vs. &quot;deferred&quot; (48-60 hr) on 90-day mortality in septic AKI (planned&#xD;
           recruitment ~ 824) - PI: J.P. Quenot (Dijon) - completion March 2015.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. STARRT-AKI (NCT01557361) (May 2012-October 2013). &quot;Accelerated&quot; (n=48) vs &quot;Standard&quot;&#xD;
           (n=52). 90-day mortality was similar, 38 and 37%. Surviving patients requiring renal&#xD;
           replacement therapy at Day 90 were only found in the standard arm, where 3.8% were&#xD;
           dialysis dependent. Median ICU length of stay and number of renal replacement therapy&#xD;
           sessions were insignificantly lower in the accelerated group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is clear that more knowledge regarding outcome concerning mortality, morbidity (end-stage&#xD;
      renal disease) as well as ICU- and hospital care consumption would be beneficial. The&#xD;
      investigators have highly detailed data from three hospitals based on a cohort of over 50 000&#xD;
      ICU patients from Stockholm. The investigators believe that the sheer number of patients&#xD;
      combined with the subjective nature* of renal replacement therapy initiation allow for useful&#xD;
      information, potentially adding to the knowledge that the RCTs hopefully will bring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      *Initiation of renal replacement therapy (= CRRT) is based on a spectrum of clinical&#xD;
      information and provider bias. Clinicians always initiate renal replacement therapy when&#xD;
      confronted with life-threatening complications (like hyperkalemia or pulmonary edema).&#xD;
      However, wide variations in the minimum severity of indications prompting renal replacement&#xD;
      therapy initiation exist. Factors influencing decisions include: age, comorbidity,&#xD;
      responsiveness to diuretic challenge; illness severity (predicted mortality); prescribing&#xD;
      service and time of day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fact that renal replacement therapy is so &quot;unregulated&quot; is beneficial for a cohort study,&#xD;
      as it is likely to create a wide variety of patients in early and late groups. It creates a&#xD;
      &quot;natural experiment&quot;. If it is good for the patients is another matter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: early renal replacement therapy is beneficial compared to late renal replacement&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: this is an observational cohort study of critically ill patients treated in three&#xD;
      hospitals (Karolinska Solna, Karolinska Huddinge and Södersjukhuset) and in five different&#xD;
      ICUs in Stockholm, Sweden, between 2007 and 2017 using the Clinisoft database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Registry: The Clinisoft database (Centricity Clinisoft, General Electric) is based on a&#xD;
      patient database management system (PDMS), implemented 2005 and initially only recorded data&#xD;
      from Karolinska University Hospital Solna (Central medicosurgical ICU and&#xD;
      neurosurgical/neurological ICU, NIVA) and Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge&#xD;
      (medicosurgical ICU, IVA). From 2006 to 2008 the other ICUs (Cardiothoracic ICU, Karolinska&#xD;
      Solna and Södersjukhusets two ICUs, one medical and one surgical) started using Clinisoft.&#xD;
      Essentially, the investigators will have complete data coverage from 2007/2008-2017. The&#xD;
      neurosurgical/neurological ICU will not participate in this study; their patients with need&#xD;
      of CRRT are treated in other ICUs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will collect demographic data, age, sex and comorbidities. Moreover, The&#xD;
      investigators will collect ICU specific data; illness severity, mechanical ventilation, need&#xD;
      for vasoactive therapy, reason for ICU admission, data on initiation of renal replacement&#xD;
      therapy. Post-ICU mortality and mortality data at different time points (30, 60, 90, 180, 365&#xD;
      and when applicable 2 and 3 year mortality) will be reported. Lastly, The investigators will&#xD;
      investigate post-ICU morbidity, including new onset CKD diagnosis and ESRD for 90 day&#xD;
      survivors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early renal replacement therapy can be defined in many ways, based on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Blood urea nitrogen level&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Grade of RIFLE/AKIN/KDIGO stage&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Hours from ICU admission&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Degree of fluid overload&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Level of pH at initiation&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Clinisoft registry, as mentioned, based on the Centricity Critical Care suite of programs&#xD;
      is run by General Electric. This registry has data based on intensive care monitors and&#xD;
      machines, ranging from medical pumps, respirators to invasive monitoring data. The registry&#xD;
      also has laboratory variables automatically imported from the electronic medical records&#xD;
      (EMR) system, Take Care. Moreover, illness severity scores, central lines, body weight,&#xD;
      urinary output and medications are entered manually into the system on a regular basis. Data&#xD;
      is regularly audited as part of the hospital standard operating procedure. There are data sum&#xD;
      checks ensuring that predefined rules and ranges are followed. The investigators have source&#xD;
      data verification, as some laboratory data from the electronic medical records (EMR) system&#xD;
      Take Care is exported to the Clinisoft registry. Coding information and a data dictionary&#xD;
      exists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Matching: The Standard Operating Procedures for patient recruitment, data collection, data&#xD;
      management and data analysis is as follows. For each case of early CRRT, The investigators&#xD;
      will create a sequentially propensity matched control patient that a) either will never&#xD;
      receive CRRT or b) will go on to get late CRRT based on absolute indications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Absolute indications:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. hyperkalemia (serum potassium≥6 mEq/L),&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. severe acidosis (pH≤7.15),&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. plasma urea&gt;36 mmol/L (equals BUN=100.8 mg/dl),&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. oliguria or anuria (urine output&lt;0.3 ml/kg per hour for ≥24 hours or anuria for ≥12&#xD;
           hours), and&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. fluid overload with pulmonary edema as defined by the presence of all the following&#xD;
           factors: (a) &gt;10% fluid accumulation (cumulative fluid balance/baseline weight&gt;10%), (b)&#xD;
           oliguria (urine output&lt;0.5 ml/kg per hour for ≥12 hours), and (c) severely impaired&#xD;
           oxygenation (PaO2/FiO2&lt;200 indicated by respiratory Sequential Organ Failure Assessment&#xD;
           [SOFA] score≥3) A patient where initiation of renal replacement therapy is started&#xD;
           without the absolute indications (&quot;early renal replacement therapy&quot;) will be matched&#xD;
           based on age, sex, chronic kidney disease, admission diagnosis group, presence of severe&#xD;
           sepsis and cumulative urine output. The investigators will try to find matched pairs&#xD;
           going on to get &quot;late renal replacement therapy&quot; and never renal replacement therapy;&#xD;
           i.e. two matched patients per early renal replacement therapy-patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size assessment: first off, out of the total number of patients - around 50 000&#xD;
      patients collected during the years 2007-2017 - the investigators anticipate at least 5%&#xD;
      treated with CRRT, i.e. 2500 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      value for p1: 0.35 value for p2: 0.45 value for α: .05 value for power (default is .80): .80&#xD;
      sample size (for each sample separately) is: 376&#xD;
&#xD;
      This power analysis is based on regular alpha and power (0.5 and 0.8) and expects a 10% (a&#xD;
      35% mortality and 45% for early vs late renal replacement therapy) difference in mortality at&#xD;
      six months - significantly smaller difference than in the Vaara, Karvellas and Leite studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This gives us a sample size of 375 patients in the two groups, 750 patients in total.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are likely to greatly exceed the numbers needed to find a difference in&#xD;
      mortality if such a mortality difference exists. It is unclear if the investigators will&#xD;
      exceed the numbers needed to find a difference in ESRD-morbidity, since the field lacks&#xD;
      adequate data to allow for a power analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan for missing data: our trial design seeks to limit the likelihood of missing data. If&#xD;
      variables are missing, unavailable, non-reported or uninterpretable the investigators will&#xD;
      use imputation by last observation. This is, admittedly, based on unscientific assumptions,&#xD;
      therefore sensitivity analyses will be conducted to assess the robustness of findings when&#xD;
      missing data has been an issue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis plan: The investigators will report continuous data as medians with&#xD;
      interquartile ranges and categorical data as counts and percentages. The investigators will&#xD;
      use the Mann-Whitney U test to compare continuous data and the Fisher's exact test to compare&#xD;
      categorical data. All statistics is two-tailed and a P value of less than 0.05 will be&#xD;
      considered significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CRRT initiation will be categorised according to early and late start according to several&#xD;
      different criteria i.e. time from ICU admission, biochemical data at initiation and&#xD;
      percentage of body weight increase. The investigators will then perform separate univariate&#xD;
      and multivariate analysis for each definition, using Cox and Poisson regression models for&#xD;
      primary and secondary outcomes and adjust for clinically relevant confounders and independent&#xD;
      factors with observed differences between patients with early and late renal replacement&#xD;
      therapy initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A competing risks polynomial logistic regression will be performed to identify predictors of&#xD;
      primary and secondary outcome at 6 months. This risks model will include four-level&#xD;
      polytomous outcomes defined as death, ESRD, ESRD and death or no negative outcome. The area&#xD;
      under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) will be used to assess discrimination&#xD;
      of each of our CRRT timing models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis will be performed using Stata version 12 (StataCorp LP, College Station, Tx, USA).&#xD;
