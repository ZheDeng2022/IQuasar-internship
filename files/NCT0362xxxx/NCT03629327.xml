  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are 33.4 million individuals living with HIV/AIDS worldwide. Despite successful HIV&#xD;
      prevention strategies such as condom use and reduction of sexual partners, HIV continues to&#xD;
      spread at an alarming rate. In 2010, 2.6 millions of new infections were detected. In&#xD;
      Sub-Saharan Africa, women represent the two-third of all new infections1. Despite the efforts&#xD;
      of the scientific community, there is still no commercial vaccine or microbicide available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To explain this natural protection against HIV, different mechanisms have been identified.&#xD;
      These women have a unique immune phenotype that we called Immune Quiescence. This phenotype&#xD;
      is characterized by lower expression of genes involved in cellular activation, lower resting&#xD;
      levels of inflammatory cytokine production, lower level of systemic activated T cells,&#xD;
      increased levels of systemic T regulatory, increased production of anti-viral anti-protease&#xD;
      serpins at the female genital tract and reduced numbers of HIV target cells (mainly CD4+&#xD;
      CCR5+ T cells) in the FGT This project aims to induce an Immune Quiescence phenotype&#xD;
      (decreasing immune activation) to prevent HIV infection&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HIV is an important global health issue. Globally, HIV is mostly transmitted through&#xD;
      heterosexual sexual activity, and women bear the brunt of the pandemic as two-third are in&#xD;
      women. New preventive strategies need to be developed to empower women to protect themselves.&#xD;
      In Nairobi, Kenya, there are around 27 000 sex workers and despite prevention efforts, HIV&#xD;
      incidence is very high in this vulnerable group which serves as catalyzers for HIV&#xD;
      transmission to the community. Among those sex workers, despite being at higher risk of&#xD;
      infection, some rare individuals remain HIV exposed seronegative (HESN). Over the years, our&#xD;
      group has tried to understand this natural protection to HIV infection. The investigators&#xD;
      discovered that in HESN individuals, the basal level of activation of the immune system is&#xD;
      lower than in other people. This includes having few HIV target cells, mainly CD4+ CCR5+ T&#xD;
      cells, in their genital tract. The investigators called this special phenotype Immune&#xD;
      Quiescence (IQ). In a recent pilot study (Limiting HIV target cells by Inducing Immune&#xD;
      Quiescence in the female genital tract ) the investigators showed that in non-sex worker&#xD;
      women it is possible to decrease the proportion of HIV target cells and/or HIV co-receptor at&#xD;
      the female genital tract by using anti-inflammatory drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Herein, the investigators are proposing to conduct a follow-up study in female sex workers to&#xD;
      determine the best drug formulation and drug size effect on reducing HIV target cell number&#xD;
      at the female genital tract (FGT). Participants will receive acetylsalicylic acid (ASA)&#xD;
      (81mg/day), ASA (325mg/day), or nothing for five months. At visit 1, the baseline immune&#xD;
      activation level of the participants will be determined. In this way, every woman will serve&#xD;
      as her own control thereby reducing the variation between tested and control groups.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized and ask to take the drug daily. Participants will be followed&#xD;
      on a monthly basis. At each study visit, blood, cervico-vaginal lavage and cervical cells&#xD;
      will be taken to determine the level of immune activation. This study is a critical &quot;second&#xD;
      step&quot; in the rational development of HIV preventive biomedical method.&#xD;
