  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have created a device designed to make it easier to insert pharmaceutical&#xD;
      implants under the skin. The device uses a blood pressure cuff to hold the skin on a person's&#xD;
      arm in place while a mechanical guide places implants underneath the skin. This device may&#xD;
      prevent implants from being embedded too deeply.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are performing this study to determine the safety and efficacy of the&#xD;
      device for use in adult women. The study will determine if the implants are placed accurately&#xD;
      under the skin (in the sub-dermal layer). It will also assess if the device causes any&#xD;
      discomfort or last pain from use.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Subcutaneous contraceptive implants are one of the preferred methods of long-term&#xD;
      contraception by the World health Organization and ministries of health in low- and&#xD;
      middle-income countries. These implants offer between three and five years of protection&#xD;
      (allowing women to safely space pregnancies and thereby reduce maternal and infant&#xD;
      mortality), are 99.95% efficacious, allow women to return to fertility quickly when removed,&#xD;
      requires no daily/monthly effort on the part of the woman, and cause minimal side effects in&#xD;
      comparison to other methods. However, availability of contraceptive implants in rural areas&#xD;
      is limited due to the skill necessary to administer them safely and accurately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have created a device designed to make it easier to insert pharmaceutical&#xD;
      implants under the skin. The device uses a blood pressure cuff to hold the skin on a person's&#xD;
      arm in place while a mechanical guide places implants underneath the skin. This device is&#xD;
      designed to prevent implants from being embedded too deeply.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this trial, the investigators will use the implant insertion device with a placebo&#xD;
      sub-cutaneous implant. Implants will be inserted with the device and the accuracy of the&#xD;
      placement will be assessed through palpation and ultrasound depth measurements. This data&#xD;
      will allow the investigators to assess whether the device ensures accurate insertions of&#xD;
      sub-cutaneous implants.&#xD;

        <description>A follow-up appointment with all participants was conducted by the physician who administered the implant. A binary assessment (yes/no) of the following will be assessed for each participant by the physician. 1) Is there currently any fluid draining from the incision? 2) Is there currently any redness or swelling of the insertion site? 3) Is there currently any bleeding from the insertion site?&#xD;
If the physician answers &quot;Yes&quot; to all three questions, the participant is deemed to have shown signs of infection.</description>

            <description>Participants in trial will be within a single study arm. All participants will have a placebo subcutaneous implant inserted with the device being studied. The implant accuracy will be assess through palpation and ultrasound depth measurements. The implant will then be removed. Safety will be assessed by measuring bruising and bleeding. A follow-up questionnaire will assess bruising and infection risk. A final visit will assess bruising and infection risk by a physician.&#xD;
