  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial has two stages: phase II and phase III. Eligible patients will be&#xD;
      randomized 1:1 to the two arms: paclitaxel plus cisplatin and cisplatin plus 5-fluorouracil.&#xD;
      The phase II stage will enroll 128 patients, 64 patients for each arm. The endpoint of the&#xD;
      phase II stage is complete pathological response (pCR). If the endpoint, i.e., the&#xD;
      significant improvement of pCR rate, is met, the clinical trial will proceed to the phase III&#xD;
      stage, in which 120 more patients will be enrolled. The estimated enrollment time is four&#xD;
      years with 3 more years of follow-up after completing enrollment. The primary endpoint of the&#xD;
      clinical trial is overall survival, and the secondary endpoints include clinical response,&#xD;
      disease free survival, operation rate, complete resection rate, tumor regression rate,&#xD;
      hospital stay days after surgery, safety and toxicity, and quality of life.&#xD;

      Stage 1: Neoadjuvant chemoradiation (CRT):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2: Evaluation of clinical responses&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluation will be done at 3±1 weeks after completing the last fraction of radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluation will be performed with panendoscopy, endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS),&#xD;
           computed tomography (CT), and positron emission tomography (PET).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 3: Surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients will receive esophagectomy with two field lymph node dissection unless:&#xD;
&#xD;
           A. Patients become medically unfit for surgery. B. Tumor becomes metastatic or&#xD;
           unresectable. C. Patients refuse surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients who do not receive surgery will go on a second section of CRT:&#xD;
&#xD;
           A. Radiation: 180cGy/fraction, once daily, 5 days a week, up to a total of 6,300cGy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           B. Arm A:&#xD;
&#xD;
           i. T: Paclitaxel 50 mg/m2, 1h IVF, weekly, week 1 to week 3 during CRT. ii. P: Cisplatin&#xD;
           30 mg/m2, 2 h IVF, weekly following paclitaxel, week 1 to week 3 during CRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
           C. Arm B:&#xD;
&#xD;
           i. P: Cisplatin 75 mg/m2, 2 h IVF, on day 1 of week 1 during CRT. ii. F: 5-FU 1,000&#xD;
           mg/m2, 24 h IVF, on day 1, 2, 3, 4 of week 1 during CRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients, who receive surgery with R2 resection or the pathology showing positive&#xD;
           margins or extracapsular invasion of regional lymph nodes, will also receive the second&#xD;
           section of CRT described in above-mentioned stage 3-2.&#xD;
