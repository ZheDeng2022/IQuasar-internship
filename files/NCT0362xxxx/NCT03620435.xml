  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm phase II trial to (1) evaluate safety and toxicity profile of&#xD;
      intravenous Atezolizumab (anti-PDL-1) administered in combination with TMT in patients with&#xD;
      MIBC, (2) To determine the loco-regional control rate (LCR) of TMT combined with PDL-1&#xD;
      blockade.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a Phase II trial (stage 1 and 2). This study will initially accrue 3 evaluable&#xD;
      patients to assess the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of combination of Gemcitabine (4 weeks at&#xD;
      100 mg/m2, given intravenously once weekly, 2-4 hours before radiation therapy) plus IMRT (50&#xD;
      Gy/20 fractions. 2.5 Gy per fraction - 5 times per week for 4 weeks) and Atezolizumab (1200&#xD;
      mg intravenous on day 1 of 3 week cycle. Once the first 3 patients are accrued, the trial&#xD;
      will be placed on hold for 3 months until acute toxicity has been assessed and the&#xD;
      combination is felt to be safe according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology&#xD;
      Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE,v. 4.03). DLT will be defined as: (1) Grade 3 or&#xD;
      higher immune related Adverse Events (irAEs), (e.g. inflammatory ocular toxicities,&#xD;
      pneumonitis, hepatitis, colitis), (2) Grade 3 or higher treatment-related AEs (TRAE) that&#xD;
      delay EBRT by &gt; 21 days. For the safety run-in component of the study, 3 patients will&#xD;
      receive Atezolizumab at a dose of 1200 mg every 3 weeks, as described above. After the third&#xD;
      patient has been accrued, the trial will be placed on hold for 3 months for an assessment of&#xD;
      acute toxicity. Acute toxicity is defined as any toxicity occurring within 90 days from the&#xD;
      end of the combined treatment of IMRT and gemcitabine. If no grade 3 or higher acute toxicity&#xD;
      is detected, Atezolizumab 1200 mg will be chosen for the rest of the trial. If one patient&#xD;
      develops grade 3 toxicity, 3 further patients will be entered at 1200 mg. . If no further&#xD;
      grade 3 toxicity is observed, this dose level will be considered safe. In case that one&#xD;
      additional patient develop a grade 3 toxicity, then 3 patients will be enrolled at the&#xD;
      reduced dose of 840mg. If no grade 3 or higher acute toxicity is detected, Atezolizumab 840mg&#xD;
      will be chosen for the rest of the trial. If one patient develops grade 3 toxicity at the&#xD;
      reduced dose, then 3 further patients will be entered at 840 mg. If no further grade 3&#xD;
      toxicity is observed, this reduced dose level will be considered safe. In case that one&#xD;
      additional patient develop a grade 3 toxicity at the reduced dose level, it will be&#xD;
      considered too toxic and the combination will be judged too toxic for the population and&#xD;
      regimen, and the study will be terminated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If treatment is well tolerated, this will be considered the final dose for the study. No&#xD;
      further de-escalation beyond this level will be considered. For the Stage 2 of this study,,&#xD;
      up to 22 other patients will be accrued (total of 25 evaluable patients). Atezolizumab will&#xD;
      be given during combination treatment, and every 3 weeks for 16 cycles or until disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
