  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether consuming tart cherry juice daily for 12&#xD;
      months reduces the risk of gout attacks during this period. Individuals with an existing gout&#xD;
      diagnosis and who have experienced at least one gout flare in the past year will be recruited&#xD;
      to participate in this study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gout is a painful and often debilitating condition affecting around 3% of adults in the UK.&#xD;
      It is a type of inflammatory arthritis caused by high levels of uric acid which is deposited&#xD;
      as crystals in joints, resulting in painful gout flares. Cherries and cherry products have&#xD;
      received attention for their possible role in gout management owing to their&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties. Their consumption has been associated with a&#xD;
      lower risk of gout attacks in one observational study. The consumption of cherries is also&#xD;
      endorsed by several gout information websites and in the British Society of Rheumatology's&#xD;
      2017 guidelines for the management of gout. However, there is limited evidence underpinning&#xD;
      these claims and existing studies tend to be short in duration and have small participant&#xD;
      numbers. Gout attacks are sporadic in nature and so a long-term trial is required to clarify&#xD;
      the therapeutic effect of cherries on gout attack risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are aiming to recruit 120 participants who have had at least one gout flare&#xD;
      in the previous 12 months. Using the work of Rothenbacher et al., 2011, the chance of these&#xD;
      individuals experiencing at least one attack in the next 12 months has been calculated at&#xD;
      11%. It is predicted that treatment with daily cherry juice consumption will reduce gout&#xD;
      flare recurrence (primary outcome measure) to 1/4 of the rate of the actual recurrence i.e.&#xD;
      to 2.7%. Using these figures, a sample size of 93 participants would provide power of 0.95 at&#xD;
      a significance level of 0.05. A sample size of 120 participants allows for an approximate 20%&#xD;
      attrition rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will consume either 30 mL tart cherry juice (CherryActive) diluted to 250 mL&#xD;
      with water or a fruit-flavoured placebo drink daily with breakfast for 12 months.&#xD;
      Participants will be followed up at 6 and 12 months at the investigators' laboratory to study&#xD;
      changes in gout flare frequency and intensity, uric acid levels and levels of inflammation.&#xD;
      This will help determine if tart cherry juice could help reduce or even prevent gout attacks.&#xD;
      Additionally, as gout is associated with increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, changes&#xD;
      in CVD risk markers, including blood pressure, arterial stiffness and cholesterol levels,&#xD;
      will also be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited through the use of posters, advertising on the UK Gout Society&#xD;
      website, emails to large organisations and through letters sent from General Practitioners'&#xD;
      (GP) surgeries to eligible patients. Potentially eligible patients will be identified by&#xD;
      surgery staff using their patient database before contact information is passed to the&#xD;
      research team at the surgery to prepare and send out invitation letters. As this method of&#xD;
      recruitment involves accessing patient identifiable data (name and home address) prior to&#xD;
      patient consent being given, an application to the Confidentiality Advisory Group (CAG) will&#xD;
      be submitted for consideration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A general linear mixed model analysis will be used to assess the effect of treatment&#xD;
      allocation, time and their interaction on both primary and secondary outcome measures.&#xD;
