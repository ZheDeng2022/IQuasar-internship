  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Knee osteoarthritis is a leading cause of chronic pain, disability, and decreased quality of&#xD;
      life. Lesioning of genicular nerves by continuous radiofrequency treatment proved to be&#xD;
      effective in relieving pain and disability caused by osteoarthritis of the knee. In contrast&#xD;
      to continuous radiofrequency lesioning, pulsed radiofrequency treatment offers pain control&#xD;
      with no or only minimal histological lesions. As a non-destructive alternative to continuous&#xD;
      radiofrequency ablation, pulsed radiofrequency treatment may have inherent appeal because it&#xD;
      may mitigate concerns regarding complications associated with the ablation of nerves.&#xD;
      However, studies comparing the ability of the continuous and the pulsed modalities of&#xD;
      radiofrequency treatment to relieve pain and incapacity due to osteoarthritis of the knee are&#xD;
      lacking. Therefore, it was the aim of the investigators of current study to compare efficacy&#xD;
      of continuous and pulsed radiofrequency treatments of genicular nerves to alleviate pain and&#xD;
      disability in patients with advanced osteoarthritis of the knee.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following approval of the Regional Research Ethics Committee written informed consent was&#xD;
      obtained from all patients. Current randomized controlled trial included patients with grade&#xD;
      3-4 gonarthritis suffering from intractable knee pain, scoring ≥5 on the Visual Analog Scale&#xD;
      (VAS) during &gt;6 months. Therapy was based on ultrasound guided radiofrequency treatment of&#xD;
      the superior medial, superior lateral and inferior medial genicular nerves. VAS and Western&#xD;
      Ontario and MacMaster Universities Osteoarthrosis (WOMAC) scores were assessed before therapy&#xD;
      and at 1, 6 and 12 months following intervention. Eligible patients were randomized in two&#xD;
      treatment groups according to the modality of radiofrequency current to which targeted&#xD;
      genicular nerves had to be exposed, i.e, the pulsed and the continuous radiofrequency groups.&#xD;
      Both two way repeated measures analysis of variance and generalized estimating equations were&#xD;
      used to determine whether the VAS and WOMAC scores obtained with either the continuous or the&#xD;
      pulsed radiofrequency modalities at each of the 4 times of assessment, i.e. at pre-treatment&#xD;
      control and at 1, 6 and 12 months after the intervention, were different.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eligible patients suffered from chronic pain (during&gt;6months) of moderate to severe&#xD;
             intensity (scoring ≥5 on a 0- to 10-point continuous visual analog scale [VAS] ranging&#xD;
             from none [0] to an extreme amount of pain [10]) due to advanced osteoarthritis of the&#xD;
             knee (grades 3-4 according to the Kellgren-Lawrence classification. The pain proved to&#xD;
             be resistant to conservative treatments including physiotherapy, oral analgesics, and&#xD;
             intraarticular injection with hyaluronic acids or steroids. In this study, genicular&#xD;
             nerve ablation was applied as an alternative analgesic approach for those who refused&#xD;
             knee arthroplasty; were judged by their surgeons as being inappropriate for surgical&#xD;
             treatment, for example, because of cardiovascular or other comorbidities; or who had&#xD;
             to be managed for persistent pain and stiffness after total knee arthroplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The exclusion criteria included knee-pain related disorders that might benefit from&#xD;
             other interventions, for example, patellofemoral disorders, meniscal injuries,&#xD;
             ligamentous laxity, and so on, acute knee pain associated with radicular neuropathy or&#xD;
             intermittent claudication, connective tissue diseases, serious neurologic or&#xD;
