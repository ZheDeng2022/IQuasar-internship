  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the present study is to investigate accuracy of changes in cardiac output&#xD;
      following passive leg raising as estimated by transthoracic ultrasound as method to predict&#xD;
      fluid responsiveness and compare that to changes in cardiac output following PLR as estimated&#xD;
      by calibrated pulse contour analysis as method to predict fluid responsiveness in patients&#xD;
      with septic shock.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One method to predict fluid responsiveness is to increase preload by transferring blood from&#xD;
      the lower extremities to the central compartment through a passive leg raising (PLR) maneuver&#xD;
      and then measure the resulting change in cardiac output. It was recently suggested that an&#xD;
      increase in cardiac output following PLR had a high accuracy compared other methods to test&#xD;
      fluid responsiveness. Different methods to estimate change in cardiac output have been used&#xD;
      in studies investigating accuracy of PLR. Most commonly calibrated pulse contour analysis has&#xD;
      been used in mechanically ventilated patients whereas transthoracic echocardiography (TTE)has&#xD;
      been used in spontaneously breathing patients. While TTE offers the advantage of being less&#xD;
      invasive than calibrated pulse contour analysis it is technically challenging and user&#xD;
      dependent and the accuracy of the two methods has not been compared.&#xD;
