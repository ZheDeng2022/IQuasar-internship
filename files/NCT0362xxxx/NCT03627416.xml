    <textblock>
      Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) is the group of inherited disorders, characterized by&#xD;
      progressive gait disturbance. There is no established therapy. Adrenoleukodystrophy (AMN) is&#xD;
      an x-linked hereditary disease. One of its form, the adrenomyeloneuropathy has the same&#xD;
      symptoms as HSP. Current therapeutic options for AMN are very limited. Repetitive&#xD;
      Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) is a noninvasive method of modulation of brain&#xD;
      plasticity. The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of rTMS in improving&#xD;
      the HSP- and AMN-related gait disturbance and other symptoms with sham stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention will include five daily sessions. In each session 1500 magnetic pulses will be&#xD;
      administered to each of both primary motor areas for lower extremities. Assessment of gait&#xD;
      and of strength and spasticity of lower extremities will be made before and after therapy, as&#xD;
      well as two weeks later.&#xD;

      Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) is a group of inherited disorders, characterized by&#xD;
      progressive gait disturbance with weakness and spasticity, which predominate in lower&#xD;
      extremities. There is no established therapy. Adrenoleukodystrophy (AMN) is an x-linked&#xD;
      hereditary disease. One of its form, the adrenomyeloneuropathy has the same symptoms as HSP.&#xD;
      Current therapeutic options for AMN are very limited. Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic&#xD;
      Stimulation (rTMS), a noninvasive method of modulation of brain plasticity proved to be&#xD;
      effective in improving the gait performance in several conditions such as Parkinson Disease,&#xD;
      vascular Parkinsonism, partial spinal cord injury and in post-stroke paresis. Previous&#xD;
      studies documented also altered cortical excitability in HSP patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of 10 hertz (Hz) rTMS over the&#xD;
      primary motor cortices in improving the gait and strength and spasticity of lower extremities&#xD;
      with sham stimulation in HSP and AMN patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention will include five daily sessions. In each session 1500 magnetic pulses will be&#xD;
      administered to each of both primary motor areas for lower extremities. Assessment of gait&#xD;
      and of strength and spasticity of lower extremities will be made before and after therapy, as&#xD;
      well as two weeks later.&#xD;
