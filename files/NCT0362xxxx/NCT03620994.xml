    <textblock>
      Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most commonly diagnosed functional bowel&#xD;
      disorders (FBD). IBS is diagnosed by symptom-based criteria，while the available literature&#xD;
      suggests that symptom-based diagnostic algorithms, which often used for clinical and research&#xD;
      studies, have poor sensitivity. Although diagnostic algorithms can discriminate IBS from&#xD;
      health or upper gastrointestinal tract conditions, studies do not provide convincing evidence&#xD;
      that the criteria can discriminate IBS from organic disease of the colon. Rectal bleeding,&#xD;
      anemia, weight loss, fever, family history of colon cancer, and age above 50 years are&#xD;
      considered the warning signs of severe gastrointestinal disease. Colonoscopy is the most&#xD;
      direct way to rule out organic colonic diseases. There is no consensus so far on whether&#xD;
      patients with suspected IBS lacking warning signs need colonoscopy or not. In 2016, the Rome&#xD;
      IV criteria was updated and published. However, there are few studies on the clinical&#xD;
      practice based on Rome IV. The value of alarm symptoms in discriminating organic disease from&#xD;
      functional disorders remains uncertain and further research is needed. To evaluate the&#xD;
      predictive value of alarm symptoms of IBS patients based on Roman IV, the investigators&#xD;
      designed this cross-sectional study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Functional bowel disorders (FBD) are a spectrum of chronic gastrointestinal (GI) disorders&#xD;
      characterized by predominant symptoms or signs of abdominal pain bloating, distention, and/or&#xD;
      bowel habit abnormalities, and the absence of obvious anatomic or physiologic abnormalities&#xD;
      identiﬁed by routine diagnostic examinations, as deemed clinically appropriate. Irritable&#xD;
      bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most commonly diagnosed functional bowel disorders (FBD).&#xD;
      characterized by abdominal pain and bowel dysfunction, presenting as constipation, diarrhea,&#xD;
      or alternating periods of both. Incidence rates of IBS are seldom calculated, and prevalence&#xD;
      estimates fluctuate both between and within countries. A literature review by Sperber and&#xD;
      colleagues suggests that a global prevalence rate could not be estimated owing to the&#xD;
      heterogeneity of the studies. The pooled prevalence rate that the investigators cited for&#xD;
      North America, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand was 8.1%. While IBS is not associated with&#xD;
      increased mortality rates, it represents a significant burden on affected patients and&#xD;
      society as a result of direct medical costs, lost productivity, and reduced health-related&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The development and persistence of IBS symptoms are understood to be multifactorial.&#xD;
      Consequently, diagnosis and treatment are complicated clinical endeavors. IBS is diagnosed by&#xD;
      symptom-based criteria, initially proposed by Manning and subsequently modified and&#xD;
      quantified in the Rome I, II, and III criteria. However, the available literature suggests&#xD;
      that symptom based diagnostic algorithms, although often used for clinical and research&#xD;
      studies, have poor sensitivity. Although diagnostic algorithms can discriminate IBS from&#xD;
      health or upper gastrointestinal tract conditions, studies do not provide convincing evidence&#xD;
      that the criteria can discriminate IBS from organic disease of the colon. Therefore, in&#xD;
      clinical practice, medical history should include evidence of organic disease (alarm&#xD;
      symptoms) in addition to the main symptoms. Rectal bleeding, anemia, weight loss, fever,&#xD;
      family history of colon cancer, and age above 50 years are considered the warning signs of&#xD;
      severe gastrointestinal disease. Colonoscopy is the most direct way to rule out organic&#xD;
      colonic diseases. It is an agreement that patients who meet Rome criteria on IBS with warning&#xD;
      signs are strongly advised to perform colonoscopy to rule out severe colonic diseases such as&#xD;
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colorectal cancer . The diagnostic sensitivity of&#xD;
      symptom criteria on irritable bowel syndrome without colonoscopy is not more than 69.7% in&#xD;
      patients with suspected irritable bowel syndrome lacking warning signs. There is no consensus&#xD;
      so far on whether patients with suspected IBS lacking warning signs need colonoscopy or not.&#xD;
      However, the value of alarm symptoms in discriminating organic disease from functional&#xD;
      disorders remains uncertain and further research is needed, especially as alarm features are&#xD;
      common.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2016, the Rome IV criteria was updated and published, in which IBS involved several&#xD;
      changes. And there are currently few clinical studies based on Roman IV. This cross-sectional&#xD;
      study was designed to evaluate the predictive value of alarm symptoms for IBS and organic&#xD;
      bowel diseases and the difference in predictive value between different subtypes based on&#xD;
      Roman IV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection：Basic information: name, gender, race, age, BMI index (height, weight),&#xD;
      marital status ；Gastrointestinal symptoms: IBS-related symptoms，change in form of&#xD;
      stool，duration and incidence of symptoms； Alarm Symptoms: Rectal bleeding (black stool, blood&#xD;
      on toilet paper), anemia, weight loss, fever, nocturnal symptoms； Lifestyle habits: eating&#xD;
      habits (spicy stimulation, dietary fiber), smoking, drinking, sleep quality, daily exercise&#xD;
      time; Family history: colorectal cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, etc;&#xD;
      Personal history: history of gastrointestinal infections, life emergency events; Test&#xD;
      results: laboratory test results，colonoscopy results. The investigators obtained relevant&#xD;
      information through consultation, telephone follow-up, questionnaire follow-up.Through&#xD;
      endoscopy results to determine organic or functional diseases, benign or malignant, through&#xD;
      contacts with the basic data, to determine the alarm symptoms. Further more, this study was&#xD;
      proved by the ethical committee of second hospital of Xi'an jiaotong university.&#xD;
