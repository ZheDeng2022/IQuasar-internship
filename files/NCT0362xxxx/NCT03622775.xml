    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well daratumumab works in treating participants with multiple&#xD;
      myeloma that has come back after stem cell transplant. Immunotherapy with daratumumab, may&#xD;
      induce changes in body's immune system and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to&#xD;
      grow and spread.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the complete remission rate (CRR) by the International Myeloma Working Group&#xD;
      (IMWG) criteria within 9 months post salvage auto-transplant with daratumumab maintenance&#xD;
      therapy starting approximately 3 months post salvage auto-transplant in patients with&#xD;
      relapsed myeloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate progression-free survival (PFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To discover the impact of daratumumab on graft function and immune reconstitution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beginning 60-120 days after transplant, participants receive daratumumab intravenously (IV)&#xD;
      over 4-8 hours on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of courses 1 and 2 and days 1 and 15 of courses 3-6,&#xD;
      then on day 1 of subsequent courses. Courses repeat every 28 days for 2 years in the absence&#xD;
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 30 and 90 days, then&#xD;
      every 4-12 weeks thereafter.&#xD;

    <description>The student t-test/Wilcoxon rank test and analysis of variance (ANOVA)/Kruskal-Wallis test, or chi-squared test/Fisher's exact test will be used to test associations between the response and the prognostic factors. Complete remission will be estimated along with a 95% credible interval.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-free survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From the date of initiation of maintenance therapy assessed up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Will be summarized descriptively using the Kaplan-Meier method (including the median, 95% confidence interval, and survival curve). The proportion of patients alive and without disease progression at 6 months of daratumumab maintenance therapy will be summarized. The estimate will be accompanied by a two-sided exact 95% binomial confidence interval. In addition, a Cox regression analysis may be performed if demographic and clinical factors potentially affecting PFS are identified.</description>
