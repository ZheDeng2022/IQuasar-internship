  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation and dose-expansion study to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD) and clinical activity of&#xD;
      etrumadenant (AB928) in combination with zimberelimab (AB122) (an anti-PD-1 antibody) in&#xD;
      participants with advanced malignancies.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the dose-escalation phase, escalating doses of etrumadenant in combination with&#xD;
      zimberelimab will be assessed in participants with advanced malignancies. Eligible&#xD;
      participants will receive oral administration of etrumadenant as well as IV infusion of&#xD;
      zimberelimab. The recommended dose for expansion (RDE) of etrumadenant will be determined&#xD;
      upon completion of the dose-escalation phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the dose-expansion phase, etrumadenant at RDE in combination with zimberelimab may be&#xD;
      assessed in participants with advanced clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC) or metastatic&#xD;
      castrate-resistant adenocarcinoma of the prostate (mCRPC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall duration of treatment will depend on how well the treatment is tolerated. Treatment&#xD;
      may continue until unacceptable toxicity or progressive disease or other reasons specified in&#xD;
      the protocol.&#xD;

             bladder cancer, ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, Merkel cell carcinoma, or&#xD;
             gastroesophageal cancer that is metastatic, advanced or recurrent with progression for&#xD;
             which no alternative or curative therapy exists or standard therapy is not considered&#xD;
             appropriate by the participant and treating physician (reason must be documented in&#xD;
             medical records).&#xD;
&#xD;
             Dose expansion only:&#xD;
&#xD;

             disease, active infections requiring antibiotics, recent hospitalization with&#xD;
             unresolved symptoms) or obscure the interpretation of toxicity determination or AEs,&#xD;

             through 90 days after the last dose of etrumadenant in combination with zimberelimab.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Any active or documented history of autoimmune disease, or history of a syndrome that&#xD;
             required systemic steroids or immunosuppressive medications, except for vitiligo or&#xD;
             resolved childhood asthma/atopy. Participants with asthma who require intermittent use&#xD;
             of bronchodilators (such as albuterol) will not be excluded from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Prior malignancy active within the previous year except for locally curable cancers&#xD;
             that have been apparently cured, such as basal or squamous cell skin cancer,&#xD;
             superficial bladder cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix, breast, or prostate&#xD;
             cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Dose escalation: Prior treatment with an anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-1, anti-CTLA-4, or other&#xD;
             immune checkpoint inhibitor or agonist as a monotherapy or in combination;&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Use of other investigational drugs (drugs not marketed for any indication) within 28&#xD;
             days or at least 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) before investigational product&#xD;
             administration.&#xD;
