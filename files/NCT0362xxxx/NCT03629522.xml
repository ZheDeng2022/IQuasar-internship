      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spinal anesthesia (SA) induced maternal hypotension is the most frequent and troublesome&#xD;
      complication in cesarean section (CS), compromising both maternal and neonatal well-being.&#xD;
      Many strategies have been used to prevent its occurrence but no single technique has been&#xD;
      confirmed to be completely effective. the investigators hypothesized that ondansetron, a&#xD;
      serotonin-receptor-antagonist, could have beneficial effects on maternal hemodynamics during&#xD;
      CS under SA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this prospective double-blind placebo-controlled study, one hundred healthy parturients&#xD;
      were randomized to receive either 8 mg of intravenous ondansetron (group O) or the same&#xD;
      volume of saline (group S), 5 minutes prior to the induction of SA. All women received a&#xD;
      coloading volume of 500 ml of saline. Maternal hemodynamics: blood pressure, heart rate and&#xD;
      cardiac output (CO) were measured with a non-invasive device based on pulse wave transit&#xD;
      time: the esCCO device Nihon Kohden hemodynamic monitor. Ephedrine was administered to treat&#xD;
      hypotension (systolic blood pressure less than 80% of baseline).&#xD;

      1. Type of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
           After institutional ethical committee approval, we conducted a prospective double-blind,&#xD;
           placebo-controlled, randomized study, at the department of anesthesiology of the&#xD;
           Mahdia's university hospital, from August to November 2017.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Parturients eligible for the present study are women who:&#xD;
&#xD;
           are scheduled for elective cesarean section under spinal anesthesia. aged between 20 to&#xD;
           40 years. are with an American Society of Anesthesiologist (ASA) physical status of I-II&#xD;
           are with a normal liver and renal function and fetal screening, and with no medical&#xD;
           history of heart disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
           are with a single fetus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Protocol description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1. Pre-operative time: A pre-anesthetic consultation, carried out at least 48 hours before&#xD;
      the surgical procedure, made it possible to define eligible women for our study, to inform&#xD;
      the parturients about the nature and the progress of the protocol and to collect their&#xD;
      consent. Women were fasted for 6 hours before surgery and did not receive any premedication.&#xD;
      In the morning of the intervention, a preoperative visit allowed us to check the application&#xD;
      of instructions and the absence of intercurrent event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2. per-operative time:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization was performed at the entrance to the operating room after verification of the&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria. All participants were randomly assigned to one of two&#xD;
      groups according to a randomization table.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the operating room, baseline values of noninvasive blood pressure (BP), electrocardiogram&#xD;
      (ECG), and pulse oximetry (SPO2) were recorded using a Nihon Kohden monitor which also&#xD;
      allowed a continuous non-invasive estimation of cardiac output (esCCO), based on pulse wave&#xD;
      transit time (PWTT) which is automatically computed from pulse Oximetry waveform and&#xD;
      electrocardiogram signals. After inputting the date of birth, sex, weight and height, the&#xD;
      monitor was calibrated by the heart rate, pulse pressure, and PWTT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peripheral venous access was secured with an 18-gauge canula. An anesthesia nurse ; not&#xD;
      included in the analysis ;verified the allocation and prepared the appropriate dose of&#xD;
      Ondansetron (8 mg) with 0.9% saline solution to a total volume of 10 ml or a placebo of 0.9%&#xD;
      saline solution10 ml. The syringes had no identifying markers indicating group allocation.&#xD;
      The nurse injected the contents of the syringe intravenously over 60 s, 5 min before the&#xD;
      lumbar puncture was performed. The anesthetist caring for the woman was blinded to group&#xD;
      allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spinal anesthesia was induced in the sitting position at the L3-4 or L4-5 interspace, with a&#xD;
      25-gauge spinal needle pencil point. We administered 10 mg of 0.5% hyperbaric Bupivacaine,&#xD;
      with 5ɤof Sufentanil and 100ɤof morphine. After injection, patients were immediately placed&#xD;
      supine with 15 degrees left tilt. All women were rapidly coloaded with 500 ml of 0.9% saline&#xD;
      solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemodynamic data were recorded at 2-min interval in the first 15-min and then every 5-min&#xD;
      until the end of the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensory block height level was checked by assessing the perception of coldness using an&#xD;
      alcohol swab, and motor block using Bromage scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supplemental oxygen was administered via nasal canula at 2L/min. Maintenance fluids (10 ml/kg&#xD;
      in the first one hour and 5ml/kg in the subsequent hours) were given at room temperature.&#xD;
      Oxytocin was given following delivery of the fetus (5 IU directly and 10 IU in 250 ml of&#xD;
      Glucose solution 5%). Antibioprophylaxis using 2g of Cefazolin was administered&#xD;
      intravenously, in case of allergy, we used Clindamycin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neonatal Apgar score was noted at 1 and 5min after delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotension was defined as a decrease in systolic blood pressure (SBP)&gt; 25% of baseline, and&#xD;
      severe hypotension was defined as SBP&lt; 80 mmHg. Treatment was initiated with intravenous&#xD;
      Ephedrine 9 mg. More bolus of Ephedrine can be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bradycardia, defined as a decrease in heart rate (HR) to less than 50 beats/min, was treated&#xD;
      with intravenous atropine 0.5 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tachycardia was defined as HR &gt;120 beats/min. Low flow was defined as a decrease in cardiac&#xD;
      output (CO) &gt; 15% from baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.3. Post-operative time:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After surgery, all parturients were transferred to the post-intervention monitoring room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard monitoring of all parturients systematically included heart rate (HR), non invasive&#xD;
      blood pressure (NIBP), respiratory frequency (RR), uterine globe tonus, bleeding, diuresis&#xD;
      and temperature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A glucose solution 5 % infusion enriched with electrolytes and comprising 20 IU of Oxytocin&#xD;
      was instituted at a rate of 2 liters to 3l/24 h depending on the weight of the parturient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol of postoperative analgesia is ensured by the administration of Paracetamol in&#xD;
      slow intravenous infusion at the dose of 1gevery 6 hours and Nefopam at the dose of 20 mg in&#xD;
      slow infusion of 30 min every 8 hours. The postoperative prescription included also for all&#xD;
      parturients Enoxaparin-based thrombophylaxis for 7 days.&#xD;
