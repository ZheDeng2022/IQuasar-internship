      The BIOREN project aims are to characterize the genetic background of renal cell carcinomas&#xD;
      and their immune environment, to try and identify biomarkers of response and to better&#xD;
      understand the mechanisms of resistance to nivolumab in renal cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Around 338,000 new cases of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) are diagnosed worldwide per year (1).&#xD;
      RCC is one of the most immune responsive human cancers. For a long time the only available&#xD;
      treatment were high-dose IL-2 and IFN-α with only a few patients achieving durable responses.&#xD;
      Clinical trials conducted in the past 15 years have led to the approval of several&#xD;
      anti-angiogenic treatments, mainly vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)&#xD;
      inhibitors and mTOR inhibitors. Currently most patients receive first line anti-VEGF therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently a better understanding of the mechanisms by which tumours evade the immune system&#xD;
      has led to the development of checkpoint inhibitors, such as anti CTLA-4, anti-PD-1 and&#xD;
      anti-PD-L1 antibodies that have been tested in various tumour types.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA)&#xD;
      have approved the human IgG4 anti-PD1 monoclonal antibody, nivolumab, for advanced/metastatic&#xD;
      clear cell RCC (ccRCC) patients who have received prior antiangiogenic therapy. PD-1 is a key&#xD;
      immune-checkpoint receptor (ICR) expressed by activated T cells, which mediates&#xD;
      immunosuppression primarily in peripheral tissues, where T cells may encounter the&#xD;
      immunosuppressive PD-1 ligands, PD-L1 (B7-H1) and PD-L2(B7-DC) on tumour cells, stromal cells&#xD;
      or both.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite encouraging results, the clinical response to anti-PD1 is not as wide as expected and&#xD;
      there are not any biomarkers 1) that are able to predict which patients will respond and 2)&#xD;
      that predict response to nivolumab in patients with ccRCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BIOREN is a translational, prospective, observational 3-cohort study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of BIOREN are to characterize the genetic background of the tumours and also their&#xD;
      immune environment, to try and identify biomarkers of response and to better understand the&#xD;
      mechanisms of resistance to nivolumab in renal cancer. We will focus on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tregs function and modulation of function,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  NK cells known to be regulated by nivolumab,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The biological rationale for coupling CXCR4 antagonist with anti PD-1 therapy, analysed&#xD;
           with mice models,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To try to identify biomarkers of response by further characterization of the tumours and&#xD;
           evaluating the immune status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will enrol patients receiving in 2nd or 3rd line treatment for metastatic ccRCC:&#xD;
      Nivolumab but also, as control cohorts, either everolimus or axitinib (approved treatments in&#xD;
      this setting), as well as cabozantinib in France (recently approved in 2nd or 3rd line).&#xD;
&#xD;
      French blood samples and archival FFPE (formalin-fixed paraffin embedded) specimens will be&#xD;
      analysed in in France, and also sent to the partners of the Transcan project Consortium&#xD;
      (Israel, Italy and Spain).&#xD;
