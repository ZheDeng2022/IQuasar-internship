  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The REspiratory Syncytial virus Consortium in EUrope (RESCEU) is an Innovative Medicine&#xD;
      Initiative (IMI) effort funded by the EU under the H2020 framework to define and understand&#xD;
      the burden of disease caused by human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. RSV causes&#xD;
      severe disease in individuals at the extremes of the age spectrum and in high risk groups. It&#xD;
      was estimated that RSV was associated with 34 million cases of acute respiratory tract&#xD;
      infection (ARTI), 3.4 million ARTI hospitalizations and 55,000 to 199,000 deaths in children&#xD;
      &lt;5 years in 2005 worldwide. These estimates were based on limited data and there is a&#xD;
      substantial gap in knowledge on morbidity and associated healthcare and social costs in&#xD;
      Europe. New vaccines and therapeutics against RSV are in development and will soon be&#xD;
      available on the European market. RESCEU will deliver knowledge of the incidence and burden&#xD;
      of disease RSV in young children and older adults in Europe, which is essential for&#xD;
      stakeholders (governments, etc) to take decisions about prophylaxis and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the burden of disease due to RSV in young children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective epidemiological, observational, multi-country, multicenter cohort study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Birth cohort of healthy infants (follow-up from birth until the age of 3 years maximum):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Passive birth cohort (n=9,000).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Active birth cohort (n=1,000).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of the study is the incidence of RSV infection-associated ARTI, RSV&#xD;
      associated medically attended (MA) ARTI (active birth cohort) and RSV related hospitalization&#xD;
      (passive birth cohort) in infants (&lt; 1 year) during 3 RSV seasons. In addition, a major&#xD;
      secondary endpoint is RSV attributable burden of wheezing.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a multi-country, multicenter, prospective, observational cohort study conducted&#xD;
      across 3 consecutive years to determine the incidence of RSV infection, RSV associated&#xD;
      MA-ARTI and RSV related hospitalization in a birth cohort of healthy subjects, recruited from&#xD;
      the general population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At birth parents will be asked by a member of the study team to participate in the active&#xD;
      cohort. If enrolled, a nasopharyngeal sample, a blood sample, a buccal sample, and urine and&#xD;
      stool samples will be collected from the baby in the first week after birth. The blood sample&#xD;
      will be collected by means of a heel prick or a venepuncture, if possible, in combination&#xD;
      with an already scheduled moment of blood sampling. Respiratory tract symptoms will be&#xD;
      assessed weekly during the RSV season by telephone or email or (daily) telephone app. If a&#xD;
      child experiences a new episode of ARTI according to the parents, the study team will visit&#xD;
      the child to collect a nasopharyngeal sample, 200µl is used to perform a point of care (POC)&#xD;
      test for RSV, and the rest will be stored for additional viral testing by Reverse&#xD;
      Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). If RSV is positive, parents will be asked&#xD;
      informed consent to obtain additional blood, nasopharyngeal, urine and stool samples at the&#xD;
      time of RSV infection and 6-8 weeks after RSV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents of all children in the active cohort will be asked yearly to fill in a questionnaire&#xD;
      until age 3 years maximum or till end of study (defined as the moment that the last included&#xD;
      subject has been followed up for 12 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If parents decline to participate in the active birth cohort, informed consent will be asked&#xD;
      for passive follow up. Parents of participants in passive follow-up will be asked to fill in&#xD;
      a questionnaire at birth and after one year. If their child was admitted to the hospital&#xD;
      because of an ARTI, clinical data will be collected retrospectively from the hospital.&#xD;
      Participating hospitals will perform RSV tests as part of standard diagnostic care in&#xD;
      children &lt;1 year of age who are admitted with ARTI. Only children with hospitalization due to&#xD;
      ARTI will be followed up by a yearly questionnaire until age 3 years maximum or till end of&#xD;
      study (defined as the moment that the last included subject has been followed up for 12&#xD;
      months).&#xD;
