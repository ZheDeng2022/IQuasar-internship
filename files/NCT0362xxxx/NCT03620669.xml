  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the trial is to assess efficacy and safety of the treatment with durvalumab in PS&#xD;
      2 patients with treatment-na√Øve, locally advanced or metastatic, PD-L1 positive NSCLC who are&#xD;
      considered unsuitable for combination platinum-containing therapy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths. An estimated 30 to 40% of patients&#xD;
      diagnosed with NSCLC have a poor Performance status (PS) defined as a score of 2 or higher on&#xD;
      the ECOG scale. PS 2 patients are often underrepresented in clinical trials despite&#xD;
      representing a very frequent and important subgroup.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Platinum-based (preferably carboplatin) doublets should be considered as standard of care in&#xD;
      eligible PS 2 patients. However the toxicity profile of platinum-based doublets remains a&#xD;
      concern. Single-agent chemotherapy represents an alternative treatment option for the PS 2&#xD;
      patients considered unsuitable for platinum doublet chemotherapy but its efficacy is limited&#xD;
      and the outcome poor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the superiority of the anti-PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab versus standard chemotherapy as&#xD;
      first line therapy in a PD-L1 positive NSCLC population, it now became the standard&#xD;
      treatment. The PS of patients enrolled in these trials were PS 0 or 1, making the benefit of&#xD;
      PD-L1 antibodies in PS 2 patients unclear. A retrospective real-life data analysis of&#xD;
      nivolumab in metastatic NSCLC revealed similar treatment-related AE between patients with a&#xD;
      PS of 0 or 1 with those having a PS of 2, confirming good treatment tolerability in poor PS&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall favorable toxicity profile of durvalumab and the absence of robust efficacy data&#xD;
      of checkpoint inhibitors in first line treatment of patients with PD-L1 positive NSCLC with a&#xD;
      PS of 2, encourage to investigate its activity in this cohort of patients when considered&#xD;
      unsuitable for platinum doublet chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, this trial aims to prolong overall survival by treating this cohort of frail&#xD;
      patients with durvalumab, compared to historical controls, treated with single agent&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
