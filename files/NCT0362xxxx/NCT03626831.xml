    <textblock>
      This is a phase IV, randomized (1:1), prospective, double-blind, placebo controlled,&#xD;
      parallel-group, single center study at the Clinical Research Unit (CRC) of the Department of&#xD;
      Nephrology and Hypertension, with its two separate locations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nürnberg, Kreuzburger Str. 2, 90471 Nürnberg, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Erlangen, Ulmenweg 18, 91054 Erlangen&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this study provide strong support for the concept that it is lower LDL-C&#xD;
      levels that is key to achieving better outcomes, and that it is possible to achieve these on&#xD;
      top of statin therapy (despite the much debated potential &quot;pleiotropic&quot; effects of statins).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At least 65 patients will be randomized (1:1) and included (informed consent) in order to&#xD;
      obtain 58 fully evaluable subjects (29 with evolocumab, 29 with placebo).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be simultaneously recruited from investigator's outpatient clinics, referring&#xD;
      physicians, and advertisement in local newspapers, and social media. Those patients that&#xD;
      appear to potentially fulfill the inclusion criteria will be invited to a screening visit.&#xD;
      After providing informed consent, patients will be tested for inclusion/exclusion criteria&#xD;
      and for feasibility of vascular measurements (in particular to ensure that adequate imaging&#xD;
      of the brachial artery is possible). Patients will provide a blood sample for laboratory&#xD;
      testing. If the patient then fulfills inclusion criteria and in the absence of exclusion&#xD;
      criteria, the patient will be enrolled into the trial, and the study visits will be&#xD;
      scheduled. Randomization will take place at the latest one day prior to the study visit 2&#xD;
      (e.g. at the latest at visit 2a).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At visit 2, baseline vascular function parameters will be obtained and the patient will be&#xD;
      given an SC injection of the study drug (either SC 420 mg evolocumab or SC placebo). At visit&#xD;
      4, the second injection of study drug will be administered. After 1, 4 and 8 weeks of&#xD;
      treatment (visits 3, 4 and 5), testing of vascular function will be repeated. At visit 6, a&#xD;
      final close out visits will be performed to gather additional safety information.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The recently published IMPROVE-IT trial was the first to demonstrate that in high-risk&#xD;
      patients, reduction of low density cholesterol (LDL-C) beyond current treatment goals by&#xD;
      addition of ezetimibe to statin therapy leads to a further improvement of cardiovascular (CV)&#xD;
      outcomes. The results of this study provide strong support for the concept that it is lower&#xD;
      LDL-C levels that is key to achieving better outcomes, and that it is possible to achieve&#xD;
      these on top of statin therapy (despite the much debated potential &quot;pleiotropic&quot; effects of&#xD;
      statins). However, ezetimibe has only limited ability to reduce LCL-C further (-24% lower&#xD;
      compared with statin alone in the IMPROVE-IT trial). Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin&#xD;
      type 9 (PCSK9) inhibition is a new treatment paradigm for hypercholesterolemia. The normal&#xD;
      function of PCSK9 is to bind to the low density cholesterol (LDL-C) receptor, and to promote&#xD;
      its lysosomal destruction in the hepatocyte. Thus, inhibition of PCSK9 protects the LDL-C&#xD;
      receptor from lysosomal destruction, resulting in increased recirculation of the LDL-C&#xD;
      receptor to the hepatocyte cell surface, and as a consequence, increased hepatic uptake and&#xD;
      lower circulating levels of LDL-C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PCSK9 inhibitor evolocumab has been approved in 2015 for the treatment of patients with&#xD;
      homocygote familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), as well as for treatment of patients with&#xD;
      heterocygote familial or non-familial hypercholesterolemia in which target LDL-C levels&#xD;
      cannot be achieved by standard cholesterol-lowering therapy, or who are statin-intolerant.&#xD;
      Evolocumab achieves a reduction in LDL-C regardless of background therapy in the order of&#xD;
      50-70% (including those on a statin). This therapy substantially increases the number of&#xD;
      patients achieving lower LCL-C target levels. Recently, the results of a large prospective&#xD;
      study (FOURIER) in 27.500 patients at high CV risk have been published. This study showed&#xD;
      that evolocumab lowered LDL cholesterol in patients already on optimized lipid lowering&#xD;
      therapy including a statin to a median of 30 mg per deciliter and substantially reduced CV&#xD;
      events (hazard ratio 0.85, confidence interval 0.79 to 0.92; P&lt;0.001). However, the&#xD;
      mechanisms mediating the improvement of CV outcomes under therapy with evolocumab are unclear&#xD;
      at present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intact function of the endothelium is a key component of vascular health. Conversely,&#xD;
      impaired endothelial function has been linked with increased future CV event rates. Intact&#xD;
      endothelium has many protective and anti-atherosclerotic effects on the vasculature. At least&#xD;
      in part, these protective effects are due to endothelial release of nitric oxide (NO). A&#xD;
      well-established and non-invasive method of assessing endothelial function in humans is by&#xD;
      measurement of flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD). In addition, recent evidence suggests&#xD;
      concurrent assessment of low flow-mediated vasoconstriction (L-FMC) improves characterization&#xD;
      of underlying CV and coronary disease compared with each parameter alone. Further,&#xD;
      endothelial function has been found to impact large artery function. Endothelial dysfunction&#xD;
      leads to vasoconstriction, greater peripheral wave reflection and arterial stiffness, and as&#xD;
      a consequence, augmentation of central (aortic) systolic blood pressure (BP). This is of&#xD;
      prognostic relevance, since aortic stiffness (e.g. determined by pulse wave velocity [PWV]),&#xD;
      central systolic BP (cSBP) and central BP augmentation have been identified as strong and&#xD;
      independent predictors of CV events in several patient cohorts. Exciting technical&#xD;
      developments of recent years have now made the ambulatory (24-h) measurement of arterial&#xD;
      stiffness possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator group has been amongst the first to show that statin treatment improves&#xD;
      endothelial function in patients with elevated LDL-C, which at least in part serves to&#xD;
      explain the beneficial effects of statins on CV outcomes. The investigator Group was also&#xD;
      able to show that an improvement in endothelial function during statin therapy is linked with&#xD;
      an improvement of pulse wave reflection. Rapid improvement of endothelial and large artery&#xD;
      function is considered to be particularly important in patients at high CV risk, such as&#xD;
      those that have suffered a recent CV event. The investigator Group hypothesize that the&#xD;
      beneficial effects of evolocumab, such as recently demonstrated in the FOURIER trial, are&#xD;
      linked to a rapid improvement of endothelial and large artery function, even in patients&#xD;
      already on optimized lipid lowering therapy including a statin. Of note, improvement of basal&#xD;
      NO activity in the renal circulation and NO-dependent vasodilation of the peripheral&#xD;
      vasculature occurs already 3 days after initiating treatment of statins. In the current study&#xD;
      we focus on FMD of the brachial artery as the primary objective parameter. This parameter,&#xD;
      which is widely accepted as an integrated measure of vascular function, is partly dependent&#xD;
      on endothelial NO production. These data would help to explain the results of IMPROVE-IT and&#xD;
      FOURIER, and add to the evidence that it is lower cholesterol levels that matter most for CV&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
