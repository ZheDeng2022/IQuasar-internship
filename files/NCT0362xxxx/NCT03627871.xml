  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Learning that most people engage in an activity can be a powerful motivator to adoption. But&#xD;
      are there instances in which people can similarly find motivation from learning that only a&#xD;
      minority of others engage in a behavior? Evidence suggests this may be possible when the&#xD;
      message is that the size of the minority has been growing in recent years. In this study, we&#xD;
      first examine how gym members' exercise patterns shift when they are informed that the&#xD;
      minority versus the majority of (a subpopulation of) other Americans exercise frequently. We&#xD;
      also test how gym members are affected by learning that the number of frequent exercisers has&#xD;
      increased in recent years.&#xD;

      Gym members register online to participate in a 28-day workout program. Upon registration,&#xD;
      participants are assigned to one of five conditions (a 2 x 2 study design plus a control&#xD;
      group). Participants are assigned to receive information about majority exercise norms or&#xD;
      minority exercise norms, and are informed that these norms are trending up or receive no&#xD;
      information about trends in these norms. Participants are then prompted to create a workout&#xD;
      schedule. Over the 28-day intervention period, participants are sent text messages with&#xD;
      information about exercise depending on their condition (i.e., majority trending exercise&#xD;
      norms, majority exercise norms with no information about trends, minority trending exercise&#xD;
      norms or minority norms with no information about trends), workout reminders before their&#xD;
      scheduled workouts, and weekly emails with additional exercise information related to their&#xD;
      assigned condition and their schedule. Participants assigned to the control condition are&#xD;
      prompted to create a workout schedule and receive text message reminders, information about&#xD;
      exercise that is unrelated to social norms, and weekly emails with exercise information&#xD;
      unrelated to social norms or trends and their workout schedule. All participants earn points&#xD;
      for participating and for each day that they go to the gym which can be redeemed for an&#xD;
      Amazon cash gift card after the end of the intervention period.&#xD;
