    <textblock>
      Injuries and disease processes that produce upper extremity deficits are devastating to&#xD;
      patients and their families. One potential avenue to treat these neurological disorders is&#xD;
      through the enhancement of neural plasticity, which is the ability of the brain to reorganize&#xD;
      and recover following insult. After a minor injury, the brain undergoes beneficial neural&#xD;
      plasticity, compensating for altered neural activity to restore normal function. However, in&#xD;
      the cases of moderate to severe injury and disease, e.g. spinal cord injury (SCI),&#xD;
      insufficient or improper plasticity limits recovery, leaving patients with long-term&#xD;
      disability. Therefore, methods that can drive robust and specific plasticity have great&#xD;
      potential to treat neurological injuries and disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Texas Biomedical Device Center (TXBDC) at UT Dallas has developed a groundbreaking&#xD;
      therapy, called Targeted Plasticity Therapy (TPT), which pairs traditional motor, sensory,&#xD;
      and cognitive rehabilitation with precise stimulation of the vagus nerve, to guide such&#xD;
      robust and specific plasticity to treat a wide range of neurological deficits.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The groundbreaking therapy developed at Texas Biomedical Device Center (TXBDC) , called&#xD;
      Targeted Plasticity Therapy (TPT) pairs traditional motor, sensory, and cognitive&#xD;
      rehabilitation with precise stimulation of the vagus nerve, to guide such robust and specific&#xD;
      plasticity to treat a wide range of neurological deficits. The success of this concomitant&#xD;
      therapy will be furthered, in part, through the development and use of mechanical devices&#xD;
      aimed at measuring the effects of rehabilitation in patients with an upper extremity&#xD;
      neurological deficit, e.g. from SCI. These devices are small hand controllers used to play&#xD;
      simple video games that can also measure force and movement. Additionally, this study will be&#xD;
      used to inform the future development of the rehabilitation game software as well as an&#xD;
      optional game chair (in patients that use wheelchairs, the games can also be played from the&#xD;
      patient's own chair).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To optimize the evaluation of these RePlay devices and software, and to decrease the time&#xD;
      requirement for patients, research will be divided into two phases. Patients can participate&#xD;
      in either one or both phases. Participation in phase II is not contingent on participation in&#xD;
      phase I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I will involve 80 participants using the RePlay devices and games on a single visit.&#xD;
      These 80 participants will be a collection of participants with no neurological disorders,&#xD;
      participants recovering from stroke, those with Multiple Sclerosis, Parkinson's Disease and&#xD;
      Spinal Cord Injuries. This will allow us to determine the ability of these patient&#xD;
      populations to enjoyably use these devices and games compared with their degree of&#xD;
      impairment. Participants' degree of impairment will be quantified by standard rehabilitation&#xD;
      measurements for each disease process, including the ASIA Spinal Cord Impairment Scale,&#xD;
      GRASSP, Jebsen Taylor Hand Function, dynomometry strength readings&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase II, 20 participants will be randomized equally to one of two groups. Each group will&#xD;
      receive the same amount of therapy, only in a different sequence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 will receive:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. two weeks of RePlay device therapy twice per week at REACT (weeks 1-2), followed by&#xD;
           re-assessment,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. then will rest for 2 weeks (weeks 3-4),&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. then will take the RePlay devices and tablets home for two weeks (weeks 5-6) for daily&#xD;
           RePlay device therapy, followed by re-assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 will receive:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. two weeks of RePlay device therapy daily at home (they will take the devices and tablets&#xD;
           home) (weeks 1-2), followed by re-assessment,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. then will rest for 2 weeks (weeks 3-4),&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. then will receive two weeks of RePlay device therapy twice per week at REACT (weeks&#xD;
           5-6), and then will undergo re-assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will allow investigators to test the Replay rehabilitation software and hardware over 2&#xD;
      two week periods in order to evaluate the pattern of game play improvement in this population&#xD;
      over time in different settings.&#xD;
