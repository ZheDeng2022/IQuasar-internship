      Phase II trial evaluating to assess the feasibility and efficacy as first-line therapy for&#xD;
      patients with non-resectable locally advanced HPV negative HNSCC of Durvalumab a&#xD;
      PDL1-Inhibitor plus Tremelimumab a CTLA-4- Inhibitor in combination with radiotherapy and&#xD;
      Durvalumab in combination with radiotherapy as first-line therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2-arm, randomized, multicenter, phase II. Step 1 is Registration. All patients need to sign&#xD;
      the informed consent form for registration. Tumor tissue then be send to the central lab for&#xD;
      defining the HPV status. If the patient is HPV negative the site will be notified if they can&#xD;
      further proceed to patient randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 2 is Randomization of all eligible patients with a centrally diagnosed, HPV negative&#xD;
      tumor in one of the two arms (Durvalumab plus Tremelimumab + radiotherapy; Durvalumab +&#xD;
      radiotherapy) after signing the informed consent form for step 2.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to explore the feasibility and efficacy in terms of treatment&#xD;
      discontinuation due to toxicity and in terms of 1-year progression free survival of a&#xD;
      PDL1-Inhibitor plus a CTLA-4 Inhibitor in combination with radiotherapy and a PDL1-Inhibitor&#xD;
      in combination with radiotherapy as first-line therapy for patients with non-resectable&#xD;
      locally advanced HNSCC in the poor prognostic subgroup.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are to investigate the benefit of the addition of a CTLA-4 Inhibitor&#xD;
      and/or a PDL1-Inhibitor to radiotherapy in terms of overall progression free survival,&#xD;
      overall survival and to investigate the approach in terms of safety, chronic toxicity and&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;
