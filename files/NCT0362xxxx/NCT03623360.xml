  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to investigate the feasibility of a novel MRI technique to assess the&#xD;
      severity of liver cirrhosis and predict complications based on functionality and perfusion&#xD;
      measurements whilst maintaining image quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal objective of this pilot study is to assess liver function and the future risk&#xD;
      of complications in patients with cirrhosis, using novel techniques and measures based on&#xD;
      free-breathing Dynamic Contrast Enhanced MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically the investigators will assess:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Whether sufficient data can be generated in patients with cirrhosis whilst maintaining&#xD;
           image quality, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The dynamic range of DCE-MRI measures in patients with cirrhosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study will, if successful, provide sufficient data to support applications for&#xD;
      larger studies to evaluate the clinical utility of a DCE-MRI imaging biomarker in patients&#xD;
      with cirrhosis.&#xD;

      This is a pilot study to investigate the feasibility of a novel MRI technique to assess the&#xD;
      severity of liver cirrhosis and predict complications based on functionality and perfusion&#xD;
      measurements whilst maintaining image quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty (20) patients with cirrhosis who attend the Leeds Liver Unit at St James's University&#xD;
      Hospital will be purposively selected by members of the research team who are also part of&#xD;
      the usual care team for these patients in advance of scheduled clinic visits. The selection&#xD;
      will be in a way to encompass the full clinical spectrum of liver function within cirrhosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An intravenous cannula will be inserted to the patient's arm by the radiographer, for the&#xD;
      automated administration of contrast agent during the scan. The participant will be asked to&#xD;
      remain still on his/her back throughout the duration of the scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo a full MRI protocol including morphological imaging, fibrosis scoring&#xD;
      tests based on relaxometry and diffusion maps, and the novel functional technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the scan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant will not have to attend any extra clinics or scan appointments. The research&#xD;
      team (that includes members of the participants ongoing care team) will continue to track the&#xD;
      health condition of the participant over a long-term period (5 years) to collect information&#xD;
      with regards to clinical events such as hospital admissions, change in treatment, further&#xD;
      procedures and death. The clinical follow-up information will be collected as part of routine&#xD;
      care through scheduled ongoing outpatient appointments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data acquired during the scans will be analysed using a novel method to quantify liver&#xD;
      function and the liver images will be reviewed by an expert radiologist to ensure that the&#xD;
      quality of these is sufficient for future clinical application. A cross-sectional data&#xD;
      analysis will be performed to identify associations between the functional biomarkers and&#xD;
      clinical indices for the assessment of liver fibrosis.&#xD;
