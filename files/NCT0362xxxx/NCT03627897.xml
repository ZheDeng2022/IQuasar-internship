    <textblock>
      Pediatric cardiac surgery is associated with moderate to severe postoperative pain that is&#xD;
      related to median sternotomy. In a fast-track protocol, used in modern-day cardiac surgical&#xD;
      care, early extubation may be facilitated by effective postoperative pain control, which also&#xD;
      helps in maintaining hemodynamic stability This prospective, randomized, and double-blind&#xD;
      study is designed to examine the efficacy and safety of the ESP block on the postoperative&#xD;
      analgesia in pediatric patients after cardiac surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      40 pediatric patients aged 2-10 years, undergoing cardiac surgery with median sternotomy will&#xD;
      be enrolled. Children received oral premedication of midazolam 0.5 mg/kg. After i.v. access&#xD;
      will be obtained, fentanyl 5 µg/kg will be given. Anesthesia will be induced with 2-3 mg/kg&#xD;
      propofol and all children will receive rocuronium 0,6 mg/kg for tracheal&#xD;
      intubation.Subsequently, fentanyl 5 µg/kg will be administered prior to incision and an&#xD;
      additional 5 microg/kg of fentanyl given prior to CPB. Anesthesia will be maintained with&#xD;
      %2-3 sevoflurane. Fentanyl 1 µg/kg will be given before skin closure at the end of surgery.&#xD;
      Patients were randomly assigned to a study group by the computer generated number table.&#xD;
      Children in group B were administered bilateral ESPB with 0.25% bupivacaine, while children&#xD;
      in group C did not receive any intervention. Following inhalational induction and&#xD;
      endotracheal tube placement, the patient will be turned into a left lateral decubitus&#xD;
      position and bilateral ESP block will be performed under aseptic conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ESP block at bilateral side will be performed in the lateral decubitis position and at T5&#xD;
      transverse process level by using 10-MHz liner ultrasound probe. The probe will be located 1&#xD;
      cm lateral to T5 spinous process in longitudinal parasagittal orientation. Simplex A 50mm&#xD;
      (B.Braun, Germany) will be inserted by using out of plane technique. The ESP blocks proceed&#xD;
      with 0,5 ml/kg of 0,25% bupivacaine (Group B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative care: All the patients then will be shifted to the intensive care unit (ICU)&#xD;
      after the surgery and managed with the institution's ICU protocol for postoperative pain&#xD;
      management and ventilation.The postoperative analgesia will be provided with rescue&#xD;
      intravenous (IV) morphine 0.05 mg/kg. Both the groups will receive IV paracetamol 15 mg/kg&#xD;
      every 6 hours as a component of multimodal analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative sternal wound pain will be judged by the Modified Objectice Pain Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative sedation levels will be evaluated with Ramsya sedation score.&#xD;

      Reducing the pain from surgical procedures performed early in life psychologically reduces&#xD;
      the pain experienced by children in subsequent procedures. Pediatric cardiac surgery is&#xD;
      associated with moderate to severe postoperative pain that is related to median sternotomy.&#xD;
      Pediatric cardiac surgical patients usually undergo multiple surgical interventions and&#xD;
      hospital admissions and will benefit from effective pain relief during their initial surgery.&#xD;
      In a fast-track protocol, used in modern-day cardiac surgical care, early extubation may be&#xD;
      facilitated by executive postoperative pain control, which also helps in maintaining&#xD;
      hemodynamic stability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuraxial analgesia techniques are eﬀective for sternotomy pain. However cardiac surgery&#xD;
      procedures potentially require cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and systemic anticoagulation,&#xD;
      thus increasing the epidural hematoma risk. Erector spinae plane (ESP) block appears to&#xD;
      provide adequate regional analgesia for multiple dermatomal levels covering the sternum&#xD;
      without increasing the risks associated with neuraxial blocks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective, randomized, and double-blind study is designed to examine the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of the ESP block on the postoperative analgesia in pediatric patients after cardiac&#xD;
      surgery. We hypothesized that the ESP block significantly improves pain control, as evidenced&#xD;
      by the reduced need for systemic postoperative analgesics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHOD After obtaining approval from the Institutional Review Boards at Çukurova University&#xD;
      Medical Faculty, 40 pediatric patients aged 2-10 years, undergoing cardiac surgery with&#xD;
      median sternotomy will be enrolled. Parental consent and patient assent from patients of an&#xD;
      appropriate age will be obtained. Patients with a preoperative ejection fraction&lt;35%,&#xD;
      ventricular arrhythmia/dysrhythmia, low cardiac output syndrome, redo or emergency surgery,&#xD;
      and known allergies to any of the study drugs will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthesia Children received oral premedication of midazolam 0.5 mg/kg. After i.v. access&#xD;
      will be obtained, fentanyl 5 µg/kg will be given. Anesthesia will be induced with 2-3 mg/kg&#xD;
      propofol and all children will receive rocuronium 0,6 mg/kg for tracheal intubation. After&#xD;
      tracheal intubation, an arterial line, central venous catheter, and urinary catheter will be&#xD;
      inserted. Subsequently, fentanyl 5 µg/kg will be administered prior to incision and an&#xD;
      additional 5 microg/kg of fentanyl given prior to CPB. Anesthesia will be maintained with&#xD;
      %2-3 sevoflurane. Fentanyl 1 µg/kg will be given before skin closure at the end of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Patients were randomly assigned to a study group by the computer generated&#xD;
      number table. Children in group B were administered bilateral ESPB with 0.25% bupivacaine,&#xD;
      while children in group C did not receive any intervention. The anesthesia resident observing&#xD;
      the patient in the postperative period and the intensive care unit staff giving postoperative&#xD;
      care will be blind to the study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following anesthesia induction and endotracheal tube placement, the patient will be turned&#xD;
      into a left lateral decubitus position and bilateral ESP block will be performed under&#xD;
      aseptic conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ESP block at bilateral side will be performed in the lateral decubitis position and at T5&#xD;
      transverse process level by using 10-MHz liner ultrasound probe. The probe will be located 1&#xD;
      cm lateral to T5 spinous process in longitudinal parasagittal orientation. Simplex A 50mm&#xD;
      (B.Braun, Germany) will be inserted by using out of plane technique. The ESP blocks proceed&#xD;
      with 0,5 ml/kg of 0,25% bupivacaine (Group B). The injection will be applied after the&#xD;
      confirmation of location by hydrodissection developed anterior to erector spinae muscle with&#xD;
      1-2 ml of local anesthetic solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative care All the patients then will be shifted to the intensive care unit (ICU)&#xD;
      after the surgery and managed with the institution's ICU protocol for postoperative pain&#xD;
      management and ventilation.The postoperative analgesia will be provided with rescue&#xD;
      intravenous (IV) morphine 0.05 mg/kg. Both the groups will receive IV paracetamol 15 mg/kg&#xD;
      every 6 hours as a component of multimodal analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative sternal wound pain will be judged by the Modified Objectice Pain Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative sedation levels will be evaluated with Ramsya sedation score.&#xD;
