  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oral anticancer treatments account a quarter of cancer treatments. These oral treatments are&#xD;
      allowed at home, avoid hospitalization and limit the use of central venous routes. Oral&#xD;
      treatments cause many side effects and patients are reluctant to report them because they are&#xD;
      afraid that their treatment will be changed. But when these side effects are poorly managed,&#xD;
      they can reduce adherence to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main hypothesis of this randomized study is that the combination of an initial&#xD;
      consultation with a trio (nurse, doctor, pharmacist) and a weekly telephone nurse follow-up&#xD;
      during the administration of oral anticancer treatments decreases the rate and duration of&#xD;
      side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to evaluate the impact at 3 months of a optimized management by an&#xD;
      initial consultation with a trio nurse, doctor, pharmacist and a weekly nurse telephone&#xD;
      follow-up versus a standard management on the level of digestive, skin and mucosal side&#xD;
      effects of grade 3 in patients with oral chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized study is realized in patients with kidney or breast cancer.&#xD;

      Oral anticancer treatments account a quarter of cancer treatments. These oral treatments are&#xD;
      allowed at home, avoid hospitalization and limit the use of central venous routes. Oral&#xD;
      treatments cause many adverse effects (nausea, vomiting, digestive disorders, skin and mucous&#xD;
      ...) that can significantly impact the quality of life. Patients are reluctant to report side&#xD;
      effects because they are afraid that their treatment will be changed. But if these side&#xD;
      effects are poorly managed, they can reduce adherence to treatment. The majority of devices&#xD;
      are evaluated post-treatment and none relates to the treatment administration period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main hypothesis of this randomized study is that the combination of an initial&#xD;
      consultation with a trio (nurse, doctor, pharmacist) and a weekly telephone nurse follow-up&#xD;
      during the administration of treatments decreases the rate and duration of digestive,&#xD;
      cutaneous and mucosal side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to evaluate the impact at 3 months of a optimized management by an&#xD;
      initial consultation with a trio nurse, doctor, pharmacist and a weekly nurse telephone&#xD;
      follow-up versus a standard management on the level of digestive, skin and mucosal side&#xD;
      effects of grade 3 in patients with oral chemotherapy (Xeloda® or Sutent®).&#xD;
