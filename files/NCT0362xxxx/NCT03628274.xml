  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sarcomas are aggressive malignant tumors issued from mesenchymatous cells. Their curative&#xD;
      treatment is mainly surgical, especially in soft tissue sarcomas, which are mostly localized&#xD;
      in limbs. Surgical margins remain a major prognosis factor and are directly linked to&#xD;
      recurrence risk. Curative surgery applies resection margins removing healthy tissue&#xD;
      surrounding the tumor and is meticulously planned thanks to tight cooperation between expert&#xD;
      surgeons and radiologist, based on pre-operative Magnetic resonance imaging(MRI). Resection&#xD;
      planning optimizes chances to perform a safe carcinological resection procedure sparing these&#xD;
      structures. Resection planning is based upon conservation (or sacrifice) of anatomic&#xD;
      compartments limited by fascia and routine MRI might also be outdated in some cases to&#xD;
      predict whether the fascia is involved in the tumor or not. Such uncertainties complexify the&#xD;
      surgical procedure, lead to unnecessary healthy tissue sacrifices and increase functional&#xD;
      impairments, which can be significant. A new MRI offering higher spatial resolution could&#xD;
      allow tumoral satellites, previously undetected on conventional MRI, which might explain some&#xD;
      of the observed recurrences. Ultra-high field MRI, considered as harmless and without&#xD;
      pharmaceutical agent injection, could bring benefits to tumoral extension comprehension and&#xD;
      should be considered as a breakthrough in medical oncology field. This is particularly true&#xD;
      in soft tissue sarcoma pathology field, where the only curative treatment to date remains&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will be propose in this project to determine the contribution of ultra-high field MRI in&#xD;
      Soft tissue sarcomas management and to evaluate for the first time the potential superiority&#xD;
      of 7 Tesla imaging over routine MRI through usual data comparison in 20 patients between&#xD;
      1,5Tesla and 7 Tesla MRI.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major patients&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients with soft-tissue sarcoma&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients agreeing to participate in the study and having signed a consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a contraindication to MRI will be excluded: Claustrophobia, metallic&#xD;
             foreign bodies, cardiac pacemakers, implantable chamber. There is no known additional&#xD;
             risk for 7Tesla MRI scanning. The same contraindications as those of conventional MRI&#xD;
             prevail.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with bone-component sarcomas will be excluded in order to have a homogeneous&#xD;
             group of tumors localized only in the soft tissues (and simpler analysis in high-field&#xD;
             MRI because of the risk of artifacts related to bone).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Intermediate malignancies will be excluded for the same reasons.&#xD;
