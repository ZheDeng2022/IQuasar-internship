      AIO-KHT-0117 (OPTIM) is a phase II, open-label randomized, multicenter study of nivolumab and&#xD;
      ipilimumab on the optimization of immunotherapy in squamous carcinoma of the head and neck&#xD;
      after prior platinum-based therapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter, phase II trial. Patients with recurrent or&#xD;
      metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck will be enrolled in this trial will&#xD;
      initiate palliative systemic treatment with nivolumab monotherapy (240 mg fixed dose Q2W).&#xD;
      Tumor response will be assessed after 4, 8, 12, 18 and 24 weeks to capture early progressors.&#xD;
      Patients with (radiologic) tumor progression during the first 6 months of NIVO mono will be&#xD;
      randomized (1:1) to receive either docetaxel (75 mg/m2 Q3W) or nivolumab+ipilimumab&#xD;
      combination (Nivolumab 3mg/kg Q2W + Ipilimumab 1mg/kg Q6W) until progressive disease [PD] or&#xD;
      death. Patients without PD within 6 months NIVO monotherapy continue treatment under study&#xD;
      surveillance for a maximum of 12 months measured from first dose of NIVO or until documented&#xD;
      disease progression.&#xD;
