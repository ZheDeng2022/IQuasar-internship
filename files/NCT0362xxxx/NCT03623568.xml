  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a proof of concept, single center study for the donation of HCV-positive kidney to&#xD;
      HCV negative recipient patients, with preemptive, interventional treatment with 12 weeks of&#xD;
      commercially available DAA therapy to prevent HCV transmission upon transplantation.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine if preoperative dosing and sustained administration of&#xD;
      pan-genotypic DAA therapy after kidney transplantation prevents the transmission of hepatitis&#xD;
      C virus (HCV) infection from an HCV positive donor kidney to an HCV naïve recipient.&#xD;
