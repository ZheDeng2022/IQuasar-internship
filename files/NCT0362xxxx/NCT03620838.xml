      The present multi-center study aimed to evaluate whether endometrioma-associated decline in&#xD;
      ovarian reserve is progressive in the absence of an intervention and is greater in magnitude&#xD;
      than the natural decline over time. Also the affect of endometrioma treatment modalities like&#xD;
      surgery or medical on the ovarian reserve over time.&#xD;

      While there is now a proven, prominent relationship between endometriosis and infertility,&#xD;
      the exact mechanism of this relationship is still unclear. The relationship between&#xD;
      endometriosis and infertility has been increasingly investigated in recent years. Infertility&#xD;
      can be explained in those patients with advanced disease, which causes disturbance of the&#xD;
      pelvic anatomy and will also prevent tubal passage, but the mechanism at the early stage of&#xD;
      endometriosis has not yet been elucidated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been shown that patients with endometriomas have low quantitative ovarian-reserve&#xD;
      tests. It has also been shown with oocyte donation studies that endometriosis may be&#xD;
      accompanied by a quantitative decrease in oocyte quality defects which may further adversely&#xD;
      affect existing ovarian reserves. There are still debates as to whether the presence of&#xD;
      endometriomas and the availability of endometriomas itself reduces the over-reserve, but&#xD;
      there is no objective study or data on the subject.There are a number of studies that&#xD;
      endometriosis may negatively affect the reserve, and also that surgery may cause further&#xD;
      damage to the ovarian reserve.There is still lack of definite data for the affect of&#xD;
      endometriomas per se and endometriomas treatment modalities ( Oral contraceptive pills (OCP)&#xD;
      / progesterone or surgery)on the ovarian reserve over time. For this reason the investigators&#xD;
      aimed to evaluate whether endometrioma-associated decline in ovarian reserve is progressive&#xD;
      in the absence of any intervention and is greater in magnitude than the natural decline over&#xD;
      time. Also the affect of endometrioma treatment modalities like surgery or medical on the&#xD;
      ovarian reserve over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is planned as a prospective study including women with endometrioma diagnosed with&#xD;
      ultrasonography and also healthy age matched women without endometriomas as the control&#xD;
      group. Endometrioma patients will be divided to 4 subgroups of patients. The first group will&#xD;
      be comprised women with endometriomas that who will not require any medical or surgical&#xD;
      intervention, the second subgroup will be comprised from endometrioma patients will be&#xD;
      treated with OCP during the study period, the third one will be comprised from endometrioma&#xD;
      patients will be treated with progesterone and the last subgroup will be comprised from&#xD;
      endometrioma patients who will be treated with surgical excision of the cyst. All of the&#xD;
      patients with and without endometrioma will be evaluated with ultrasonography for Antral&#xD;
      Follicle Count (AFC) and blood samples will be taken during recruitment for Anti-müllerian&#xD;
      Hormone (AMH) values. Additional assessments will be done after 3 and 6 months after the&#xD;
      first assessment. All the results will be statistically compared within the groups.&#xD;
