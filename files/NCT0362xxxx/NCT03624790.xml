      challenge virus administered intranasally to healthy adults.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, infectivity and replication, and immunogenicity of a&#xD;
      recombinant respiratory syncytial virus (rRSV A/Maryland/001/11) challenge virus administered&#xD;
      intranasally to healthy adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be admitted to the inpatient isolation unit and will receive a single dose&#xD;
      of 10^5 plaque forming units (PFUs) of rRSV A/Maryland/001/11, delivered intranasally on Day&#xD;
      0. Participants will be enrolled outside of the RSV season between April 1 and October 31.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will remain in the inpatient isolation unit for a minimum of 8 days after the&#xD;
      challenge and will be discharged after two RSV reverse transcription polymerase chain&#xD;
      reaction (RT-PCR) results lower than 3 Log10 genome equivalents per mL of nasal wash.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon discharge from the inpatient unit, participants will attend outpatient visits on Days 10&#xD;
      (if previously discharged), 28, and 56. These study visits may include physical examinations,&#xD;
      blood collection, and nasal washes. At 6 months, there will be a follow-up phone contact to&#xD;
      assess for any new chronic conditions or serious health events/hospitalizations.&#xD;
