  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sarcopenia is a syndrome characterized by progressive and generalized loss of skeletal muscle&#xD;
      mass and strength, shown to be prevalent in adults with cancer and common chronic&#xD;
      comorbidities such as liver cirrhosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EWGSOP identified a grading for Sarcopenia into pre-sarcopenia (decreased muscle mass&#xD;
      with normal strength and physical performance), sarcopenia (decreased muscle mass with&#xD;
      decreased strength or performance), severe Sarcopenia (decreased muscle mass, strength and&#xD;
      performance) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sarcopenia has emerged as an independent predictor of poor prognosis in a variety of clinical&#xD;
      conditions.Sarcopenia is clinically important because it can affectthe quality of life of&#xD;
      patients with cirrhosis .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skeletal muscle mass is not only a good indicator of nutrition in patients with cirrhosis,&#xD;
      but also has recently been shown to be closely associated with survival prognosis and&#xD;
      postoperative complications inHCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combination of sarcopenia and the Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) has been shown to&#xD;
      be an excellent model for predicting prognosis in decompensated liver cirrhosis .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most patients awaiting liver transplantation (LT) are more or less in a state of sarcopenia.&#xD;
      Several studies have reported that sarcopenia was associated with worse prognosis.In&#xD;
      addition, sarcopenia may be associated with a higher risk of post-transplant infection .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of sarcopenia in patients with liver cirrhosis:_ The European Working Group on&#xD;
      Sarcopenia in Older People recommended that the definition of sarcopenia include not only low&#xD;
      muscle mass but also low muscle function . They recommended cutoff values for muscle mass&#xD;
      measurements (7.26 kg/m2 for men and 5.5 kg/m2 for women using dual X-ray absorptiometry, and&#xD;
      8.87 kg/m2 for men and 6.42 kg/m2 for women using bioimpedance analysis, handgrip strength&#xD;
      (&lt;30 kg for men and &lt;20 kg for women), and usual gait speed (&lt;0.8 m/s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate sarcopenia in different stages of liver cirrhosis by different diagnostic&#xD;
           methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify the prognostic value of CT in the diagnosis of sarcopenia .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify effect of sarcopenia inliver transplant candidate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type of the study:the study is divided into two parts First part: observational descriptive&#xD;
      cross sectional study. Second part: follow up of liver transplant candidate group (pre and&#xD;
      post liver transplantation) Duration of study: expected duration of the study will be 1.5&#xD;
      years . The 1st part will include all patients admitted to the department for 1 year fulfill&#xD;
      inclusion criteria .&#xD;
&#xD;
      2nd part will be 6 ms follow up after liver transplantation. Study population&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. st part : Patients with liver cirrhosis will be evaluated for the presence of&#xD;
           sarcopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. nd part:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  13 cases of liver cirrhosis already done liver transplantation in AL&#xD;
                Rajhiuneversitiy hospital(which data already recoreded) and any cirrhotic pts will&#xD;
                be prerared for liver transplantion within six months.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Methods At the study entry, all candidates will be subjected to the following&#xD;
                parameters (and 3 month after LT for liver transplant candidates only)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Clinical history&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Clinical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Abdominal ultrasound&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Laboratory investigation:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Liver function tests&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Complete blood picture,&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Kidney function tests,&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Serum glucose, serum Na+ and K+&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Hepatitis markers (HBsAg, HCV-Ab)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Calculate:&#xD;
&#xD;
                = Child Pugh score (Pugh et al., 1973) and MELD (Wiesner et al., 2003) scores for&#xD;
                assessment ofliver cirrhosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Anthropometric measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Triceps skin fold thickness (TSF) .&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Measure mid-arm circumference (MAC).&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Body mass index&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Hand grip to assess muscle strength&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Gait speed to assess physical performance&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Assessment of sarcopenia using CT scan:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Assessment of sarcopenia using ultrasound:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Assessment of sarcopenia using bioimpedance analysis&#xD;
