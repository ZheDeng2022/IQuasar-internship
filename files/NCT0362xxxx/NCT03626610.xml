      'Pre-EMPT' - A cohort-controlled, interventional study to assess the effects of a pre-emptive&#xD;
      exercise programme, or 'prehabilitation', in patients undergoing peri-operative chemotherapy&#xD;
      for adenocarcinoma of the lower oesophagus and gastro-oesophageal junction.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oesophageal cancer has the fastest rising incidence of any solid tumour in the western world&#xD;
      with the UK, and London, having particularly high rates of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those patients being considered for &quot;cure&quot; will benefit from pre-operative/neo-adjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy (NAC), which is known to have a deleterious effect on fitness and is associated&#xD;
      with increased post-operative morbidity. Post-operative morbidity is also associated with&#xD;
      reduced survival. Reduction in fitness is compounded by major surgery and significantly&#xD;
      reduces the numbers of patients who commence or complete the standard treatment of&#xD;
      post-operative chemotherapy to around 40%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemotherapy and surgery for oesophageal cancer both represent significant physiological&#xD;
      insults that may have detrimental effects on physical activity and outcomes after surgery.&#xD;
      Cardiopulmonary exercise (CPEX) testing has been effectively used in numerous tumour groups&#xD;
      to predict outcome after surgery, although its role in oesophageal cancer patients remains&#xD;
      uncertain owing to conflicting data from institutional series. Advanced exercise programmes,&#xD;
      sometimes termed 'prehabilitation', directed by experienced multidisciplinary teams are&#xD;
      increasingly being used to mitigate the secondary effects of cancer treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      'Prehabilitation' has been shown to reduce postoperative morbidity and mortality in thoracic&#xD;
      patients undergoing elective high-risk surgery. In addition, results of studies examining&#xD;
      physical exercise and cancer recurrence/survival which effect immune system function in&#xD;
      cancer survivors suggest that physical exercise training may improve a number of immune&#xD;
      system parameters that may be important in cancer defence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators believe that optimising patient fitness through a structured and&#xD;
      expert-devised exercise programme of 'prehabilitation' during neo-adjuvant chemotherapy and&#xD;
      prior to surgery will mitigate the effects of chemotherapy and improve patient outcomes after&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators intend to assess the feasibility of a 'prehabilitation' programme and&#xD;
      quantify the resultant effects primarily using CPEX testing. In addition, changes in hospital&#xD;
      'length of stay' will be documented with a number of additional parameters.&#xD;
