             or with plasma glucose ≧ 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) in the two-hour 75-gram oral glucose&#xD;
             tolerance test (OGTT).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. With at least one cutaneous ulcer on the foot or the lower legs, and not healing for&#xD;
             at least 4 weeks (the ≧2-week standard of care period can be counted as part of the&#xD;
             4-week ulcer history).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. With ankle brachial index (ABI) ≥ 0.4 on the limb with the study ulcer. For subjects&#xD;
             with 0.6&gt;ABI ≧0.4, the investigator will arrange for providing proper treatment to the&#xD;
             subject, such as improving circulation by medication or surgical procedures, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The study wound is not prone to infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The wound should allow complete sealing of the wound by TegadermTM film.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. The study wound size is between 1~33 cm2. The depth of wound may reach ligament, joint&#xD;
             capsule, fascia, or tendon. There should be no sign of osteomyelitis. The wound does&#xD;
             not exceed Wagner Grade 27.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Under the standard care of Investigator for at least 2 weeks, the study wound has not&#xD;
             shown significant healing. Significant healing is defined as the following: The area&#xD;
             of healed tissue reaches at least 30% of the area of initially presented wound.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. When the subject has more than one wound which met the inclusion criteria, only one&#xD;
             wound is selected as the study wound. The other wounds will be treated by standard&#xD;
             cares.&#xD;

&#xD;
               1. AST or ALT &gt; 5 × ULN,&#xD;

          6. With history of HIV infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. With history of alcoholism or drug abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Received any cell-based product at the study wound.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Received an investigational drug, device or biological/bioactive treatment within 30&#xD;
