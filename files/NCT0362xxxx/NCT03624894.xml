      Suitability of intraoral impressions for assessment of wear of teeth and restorative&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The study will assess suitability of intraoral impressions for assessment of wear of&#xD;
      artificial dental restorative materials over 60 months. Subjects are recruit from patients&#xD;
      that undergo a dental restorations independently from the present study. The sample size of&#xD;
      n=65 would enable detection of differences in material and tooth wear greater than 10-13%&#xD;
      from the baseline volume of teeth, when compared with volumes of teeth obtained from&#xD;
      impressions taken at follow-ups, with the power of 0.8 and for the significance level of&#xD;
      p=0.05. Paired t-test or a Wilcoxon signed-rank test is implemented depending on the&#xD;
      distribution of the variables, for primary aim of evaluating suitability of polyvinylsiloxane&#xD;
      dental impression for determination of wearing of teeth and restorative materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paired t-test for each sub-score or a Wilcoxon-signed rank test is implemented, depending on&#xD;
      the distribution of the variables, for secondary aims. Then, if variables are considered also&#xD;
      as categorical, a Mc Nemar test for each sub-score will be suggested&#xD;

    <description>3D models will be obtained from intraoral impressions taken at baseline, at 3 and at 5 years fo follow-up. 3D models obtained at different times will be compared by a 3D software (Aadva LabScan Software, GC Corporation, Japan), able to overlap the volumes and identify all areas where surfaces have been worn. The software is able to create graphical images of the occurred wear, but also to numerically quantify the volume lost due to wear. The software is able to evaluate differences till 0,001 mm, but for this study the limit for precision had been set to 0,01 mm.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Level of wear of different restorative materials</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The 3D evaluation of wear will identify the entity of wear for different substrates, and different behaviour of dental material will be possibly highlighted. Is it more than possible that under the same biting forces, different materials will show different wear, revealing which of them will be more suitable for long term, successful, dental restoration.</description>
