  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hyperhidrosis is a disorder of abnormal excessive sweating. Primary hyperhidrosis (armpits,&#xD;
      hands, and feet) affects approximately 4.8% of the US population and is believed to be caused&#xD;
      by an overactive cholinergic response of the sweat glands. Current therapies have limited&#xD;
      effectiveness, significant side effects, and can be invasive and costly. Sofpironium bromide&#xD;
      (BBI-4000) is a novel soft-drug in development for the topical treatment of hyperhidrosis.&#xD;
      This Phase 3 study will assess the long-term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of&#xD;
      sofpironium bromide gel applied topically to subjects with axillary hyperhidrosis.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label, phase 3 long-term study designed to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      local tolerability and efficacy of sofpironium bromide gel when applied topically to the&#xD;
      axillae.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will apply the gel once daily at bedtime, to both axillae.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A maximum of 300 subjects, will be randomized to receive one of two sofpironium bromide gel&#xD;
      concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events, vital signs, and local tolerability assessments will be collected at each&#xD;
      visit. Urine pregnancy tests will be taken throughout the course of the study for women of&#xD;
      child bearing potential. Blood and urine samples will be collected and analyzed for routine&#xD;
      hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis parameters at specified visits. Patient-reported&#xD;
      outcome assessments will be recorded during the study at predefined time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be comprised of a total of 17 scheduled visits to take place over a 52 week&#xD;
      period.&#xD;

             Baseline Visit (Visit 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of any cholinergic drug (e.g., bethanechol) within 15 days of the Baseline Visit&#xD;
             (Visit 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of any anti-anxiety and/or anti-depressant, amphetamine product or drugs with&#xD;

        NOTE: If anticholinergic side effect(s) are experienced on these medications prior to&#xD;
        starting study medication; document the side effect(s) and severities in the source&#xD;

          -  Any other condition, including psychiatric illness (depression and/or anxiety) that&#xD;
             would interfere with study participation and/or evaluation of study endpoints or&#xD;
             laboratory abnormality that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would put the subject&#xD;
             at unacceptable risk for participation in the study or may interfere with the&#xD;
             assessments included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
