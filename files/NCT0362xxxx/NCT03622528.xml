      The purpose of this project is to validate quantitative lung structure assessment using an&#xD;
      automated analysis software (VIDA), for application to low dose computed tomography (LDCT)&#xD;
      acquired for lung cancer screening. Currently the software runs on standard dose CT data. In&#xD;
      addition, it is the plan to incorporate algorithms into the software to address assessment of&#xD;
      any identified pulmonary lesions.&#xD;

      The purpose of this project is to validate quantitative lung structure assessment using an&#xD;
      automated analysis software (VIDA), for application to low dose computed tomography (LDCT)&#xD;
      acquired for lung cancer screening. Currently the software runs on standard dose CT data. In&#xD;
      addition, it is the plan to incorporate algorithms into the software to address assessment of&#xD;
      any identified pulmonary lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Lung Cancer Screening Clinic is a new program that screens a group of patients that meet&#xD;
      a predetermined criteria, set by the program, for lung cancer. At this time primary care&#xD;
      providers, within the UIowa network, have the ability to place an order for this screening&#xD;
      process for their patients. The hope is to expand this program to any primary care provider&#xD;
      in the future. Clinic staff look over the patients past medical history to determine if they&#xD;
      fit the clinic criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study, the study team will ask the patients seen in the lung cancer screening clinic&#xD;
      at the University of Iowa to undergo an additional standard dose CT scan during that same&#xD;
      visit(for comparison/validation of the software performance). For those subjects that agree&#xD;
      to participate, the study team will also ask to collect the data and CT scans that were also&#xD;
      collected for their clinical Lung Cancer Screening visit. For this group the study team will&#xD;
      also ask to collect all medical records associated with nodules found at this Lung Cancer&#xD;
      Screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study team propose to test the performance of VIDA's existing image analysis tools for&#xD;
      the assessment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), when applied to the LDCT data&#xD;
      acquired for lung cancer screening. The study team will also develop new lung nodule&#xD;
      evaluation functions to specifically address the clinical needs within the at-risk lung&#xD;
      cancer patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To carry out the work, the study team propose two specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Validate VIDA's quantitative computed tomography (QCT) metrics for COPD and emphysema&#xD;
           utilizing the lung cancer LDCT screening cohort as compared to the standard quantitative&#xD;
           high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scanning protocol. With collaboration between&#xD;
           the University of Iowa and VIDA, the study team will establish a tightly controlled, CT&#xD;
           data acquisition protocol in our local lung cancer screening program. Data collected&#xD;
           will incorporate thin-slice and iterative reconstructions, breath coaching to target&#xD;
           lung inflation levels for patients and HRCT data acquisition in a sub-cohort. The VIDA&#xD;
           analysis will be refined and the appropriate reconstruction setting identified such that&#xD;
           the outputs from the LDCT data correlate to the HRCT (current standard) outputs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Complete and refine development of VIDA's novel lung nodule segmentation algorithm for&#xD;
           solid and non-solid nodules using the standardized lung cancer LDCT screening protocol.&#xD;
           Automated nodule segmentation in CT scans is challenging due to border ambiguity with&#xD;
           neighboring structures (such as vessels and the pleura), poor boundary contrast of more&#xD;
           subtle nodules, and noise associated with LDCT. The study team will develop a novel&#xD;
           method that robustly segments pulmonary lesions by allowing mutual interaction between&#xD;
           the nodules and surrounding structures, leading to a highly accurate segmentation with&#xD;
           less manual corrective actions for a high volume lung cancer screening workflow.&#xD;
