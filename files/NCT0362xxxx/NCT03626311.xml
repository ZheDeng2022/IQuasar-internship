    <textblock>
      A randomized, double-blind controlled, multicenter study in SLE patients given AKBM-3031or&#xD;
      placebo for 24 weeks (randomized period) and followed by an open label extension (OLE)&#xD;
      treatment with AKBM-3031 for the next 24 weeks. Patients will be maintained on stable doses&#xD;
      of background medications, except for glucocorticoids. Decreases in doses of glucocorticoids&#xD;
      will be encouraged during the first 20 weeks of both the randomized and open label extension&#xD;
      portions of the trial. Stable doses of glucocorticoids and other background medications are&#xD;
      required during weeks 20-22 and 44-48.If indicated by the PI, brief increases in&#xD;
      corticosteroids are permitted during the first 20 weeks of both the blinded and open label&#xD;
      extension portion of the trial. The increase in prednisone (or equivalent) dose is limited to&#xD;
      2X the back-ground level to a maximum of20 mg/day for a maximum of 1 week (7 days) or to a&#xD;
      single administration of intravenous methylprednisolone or equivalent at a maximum dose of&#xD;
      500mg. Stable doses of glucocorticoids and other background medications are required during&#xD;
      weeks 20-22 and 44-48&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Eligible patients will be randomized (1:1) to receive either AKBM-3031 or placebo during the randomized period.The randomized subjects will take (4)1 gram capsules of product or placebo every day, (2) 1 gram capsules in the morning and (2) 1 gram capsules in the evening, for a total of 4 grams per day for the first 24 weeks (randomized period). All subjects may continue to a 24-week extension (Open Label Extension) of open-label AKBM-3031, 4 grams/day. The total study duration per subject is 48 weeks. With about 4 months for site activation and 12 months for enrollment, the entire study is expected to complete in approximately 116 weeks.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Both physical component scores (PCS) and mental component scores (MCS) will be assessed. Change in both PCS and MCS will be evaluated over the time of this study. The SF-36 is a patient recorded survey of health related quality of life, consisting of the evaluation of 8 domains, and then scored from 0-100. The higher score correlates to better health-related quality of life. The mean for healthy individuals is 50.</description>

    <description>Krill are shrimp-like small crustaceans (up to 6 cm) found in all the world's oceans, but mostly in the Arctic and Antarctic polar seas. Krill are rich in the long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids or LC-PUFAs eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, C20:5n3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, C22:6n3). The lipid pool of krill is composed of phospholipids and triglycerides and the LC-PUFAs are primarily in the phospholipid fraction.&#xD;
The product is produced under food Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) regulations and has status as GRAS or Generally Recognized As Safe. GRAS is defined by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a substance that is generally recognized, among qualified experts, to be safe under the conditions of its intended use.</description>
