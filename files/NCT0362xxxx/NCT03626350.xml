  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To test the idea that submucosal endoscopy is effective and safe for endoscopic myotomy,&#xD;
      endoscopic submucosal dissection, and access for tissue acquisition and resection. Submucosal&#xD;
      endoscopy is a recent innovative addition to gastrointestinal endoscopy. This involves&#xD;
      endoscopic maneuvers in the gut wall, by dissection of the submucosal layer of GI tract,&#xD;
      thereby allowing endoscopic myotomy (incision of the muscle), endoscopic access for tissue&#xD;
      acquisition and therapy, and resection of precancerous and cancerous gastrointestinal tissue.&#xD;
      This approach has been a dramatic game-changer for minimally invasive management of various&#xD;
      gastrointestinal conditions such as Zenker's diverticulum, Achalasia, Spastic Esophageal&#xD;
      Disorders, Gastroparesis, esophageal obstruction, Hirschsprung's Disease, and&#xD;
      Gastrointestinal neoplasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the proposed study is to prospectively assess technical success, clinical success,&#xD;
      and adverse events after submucosal endoscopy. Technical success will be defined as ability&#xD;
      to successfully complete the submucosal endoscopic procedure. Clinical success will be&#xD;
      defined as symptom relief and objective evaluation which will be assessed with radiologic&#xD;
      imaging, repeat endoscopy, gastrointestinal motility studies, and pathology results routinely&#xD;
      performed post-procedure for clinical care, as indicated. Adverse events will be recorded per&#xD;
      published ASGE criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A database/ registry of patients undergoing submucosal endoscopic procedures will be created&#xD;
      to demonstrate this.&#xD;

        A prospective database/registry of patients undergoing submucosal endoscopic procedures&#xD;
        will be formed. Women and minorities will be included as they are frequently found to have&#xD;
        indications for which submucosal endoscopic procedures may be indicated.&#xD;
