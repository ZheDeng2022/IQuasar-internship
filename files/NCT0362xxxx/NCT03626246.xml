  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Kidney disease patients have a variety of bone disorders that result in bone loss and&#xD;
      fractures. The mechanisms of these bone disorders are not clear but may be related to&#xD;
      abnormal modification of a bone protein known as collagen. Therefore, the investigators are&#xD;
      conducting this research study to identify underlying mechanisms that are responsible for the&#xD;
      disruption of bone collagen and determining whether the abnormal bone collagen impairs bone&#xD;
      strength. The investigators intend to identify these mechanisms through studying&#xD;
      relationships between kidney disease and bone strength via bone imaging, bone biopsy and&#xD;
      non-invasive measures from blood and skin.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Kidney disease patients have abnormal protein (bone collagen) modifications in their bone&#xD;
      that may increase the risk of breaking a bone (fracture). Preventing bone collagen from&#xD;
      becoming abnormal may decrease the risk of breaking a bone, such as the spine or hip.&#xD;
      Currently, the effect of abnormal bone collagen on bone strength is not fully defined, and&#xD;
      there are no methods to measure the abnormal protein content without a bone biopsy. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to define the effects of bone collagen on bone strength and to&#xD;
      identify non-invasive markers that will tell us how much abnormal collagen is in the bone. If&#xD;
      the investigators are able to identify a non-invasive marker of abnormal bone protein then&#xD;
      they may be able to prevent the build-up of this protein and lower the risk of a fracture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the participant chooses to be in the study, the investigators will get information from&#xD;
      the participant's medical records such as diagnosis, the medicines and treatments prescribed&#xD;
      by the participant's doctor, and the participant's lab test results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be two study visits, each lasting about 3 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1: At the baseline visit, study procedures include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Completing medical history, physical activity level, and dietary questionnaires for&#xD;
           calcium and vitamin D.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood sample&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bone Imaging will: dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) to measure bone mineral&#xD;
           density, high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HRpQCT) to measure&#xD;
           bone quality, and back x-rays to assess for the presence of spine fractures.Females who&#xD;
           are able to become pregnant will also provide a urine specimen for pregnancy testing. (A&#xD;
           negative pregnancy test is required prior to bone imaging.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measure levels of Advanced Glycation End products (AGEs) in the skin of the&#xD;
           participant's forearm and also in the participant's bone by bone biopsy. Advance&#xD;
           Glycation End products may play a role in the development of weakened bone due to&#xD;
           chronic kidney disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2: The participant's second visit will occur within 6-months of enrollment. At this&#xD;
      visit, the participant will undergo a bone and muscle biopsy at the hip area under conscious&#xD;
      sedation and a localized pain numbing medicine. The bone biopsy provides detailed information&#xD;
      about the quality of the participant's bone that cannot be obtained through other tests like&#xD;
      x-rays or blood tests. The investigators will use the bone biopsy to determine the amount of&#xD;
      abnormal protein in the participant's bone. The muscle biopsy informs about the health of the&#xD;
      participant's muscle fibers and allows us to detect any muscle mass wasting associated to&#xD;
      chronic kidney disease. Since the piece of muscle is taken form the bone biopsy, no extra&#xD;
      incision is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of the participant's participation from start of antibiotics through the actual&#xD;
      bone biopsy will be approximately 3 weeks and 5 days (26 days).&#xD;
