      This study will look at the safety and effectiveness of the combination of palbociclib and&#xD;
      letrozole and ovarian suppression for premenopausal patients who have&#xD;
      ER-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer that has not yet been treated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      NSABP FB-13 is a phase II, open label study to examine the biological and clinical effect of&#xD;
      neoadjuvant endocrine therapy with letrozole, palbociclib and ovarian suppression in&#xD;
      premenopausal patients with estrogen-receptor (ER) positive, HER2-negative, early invasive&#xD;
      breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Premenopausal women newly diagnosed with ER-positive/HER2-negative early breast cancer who&#xD;
      are suitable candidates for neoadjuvant endocrine therapy will be invited to join the FB-13&#xD;
      trial. A screening Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score® will be performed by Genomic Health,&#xD;
      Inc. (GHI) on the diagnostic tissue of consenting patients to verify eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be stratified into one of two approximately equal sized cohorts based on&#xD;
      baseline Breast Recurrence Score (RS) (cohort 1: patients with RS less than 11 or cohort 2:&#xD;
      patients with RS 11 to less than 26).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in both cohorts will receive letrozole 2.5 mg by mouth daily, palbociclib 125 mg by&#xD;
      mouth daily for 21 days of a 28 day cycle, and goserelin 3.6 mg subcutaneous injection on Day&#xD;
      1 of each 28 day cycle. At Week 6 of study therapy, patients will have two core-cut biopsies.&#xD;
      Patients from both cohorts who have a Ki67 less than 10% level will continue receiving study&#xD;
      therapy for a total of 6 cycles. Patients with a persistent Ki67 greater than or equal to 10%&#xD;
      at week 6 will permanently discontinue study therapy and begin neoadjuvant chemotherapy or&#xD;
      proceed to surgery at the discretion of the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-treatment samples and post-surgical samples will be collected and analysed to identify&#xD;
      subgroups of patients who may derive the most clinical benefit. The results of the biological&#xD;
      analyses may allow a target sensitive population to be selected for future trials. The tissue&#xD;
      collected in FB-13 will form an integral part of the primary analyses; so all core biopsies&#xD;
      in this trial will be mandated for patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two core-cut biopsies will be collected from each patient at baseline, after 6 weeks of study&#xD;
      therapy, and upon completion of study therapy (24 weeks) at the time of definitive surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be collected at baseline, 4 weeks, and at 24 weeks for estrone and&#xD;
      estradiol levels to demonstrate ovarian suppression. A 4-week estradiol level in the&#xD;
      postmenopausal range will be required to receive further treatment on study.&#xD;
