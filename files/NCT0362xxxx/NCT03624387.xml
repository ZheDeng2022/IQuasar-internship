  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Geriatric Inclusive Art (GIA) painting activity is a new form of art therapy, which has been&#xD;
      adapted for older adults hospitalized in medical wards. GIA painting sessions have been&#xD;
      associated with a decrease of in-hospital mortality and length of stay, particularly in&#xD;
      patients with cognitive impairment. Preservation of a stable health status as well as&#xD;
      functionality in activities of daily living of older inpatients is a primary objective of&#xD;
      care management, in order to avoid deconditioning, long hospital stays and related higher&#xD;
      costs.&#xD;

      1. The introduction of the problem Preservation of a stable health status as well as&#xD;
           functionality in activities of daily living of older inpatients is a primary objective&#xD;
           of care management, in order to avoid deconditioning, long hospital stays and related&#xD;
           higher costs. Geriatric Inclusive Art (GIA) painting sessions have been associated with&#xD;
           a decrease of in-hospital mortality and length of stay, particularly in patients with&#xD;
           cognitive impairment. A cycle of Geriatric Inclusive Art (GIA) painting sessions could&#xD;
           be a complementary and have a synergistic action with usual care provided to older&#xD;
           inpatients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The purpose of the study The overall objective of the study is to examine the effects of&#xD;
           Geriatric Inclusive Art (GIA) painting sessions on neuropsychological and health&#xD;
           conditions in older inpatients with cognitive impairment (i.e.; from mild to severe&#xD;
           dementia) admitted in medical wards of the Division of Geriatrics at the Jewish General&#xD;
           Hospital (Montreal, Quebec).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The motivation for this approach Patients with dementia in a hospital setting are highly&#xD;
           vulnerable. Prospective studies show higher rate of adverse outcomes including&#xD;
           mortality, delirium, and longer hospital stays. There are limited pharmacological&#xD;
           treatment options for demented patients with many adverse effects and the possibility of&#xD;
           worsening the illness. Thus, non-pharmacological approaches have their place in the&#xD;
           treatment of these patients: they should always be prioritized and used in combination&#xD;
           with medication if needed. Art therapy has been used as a non-pharmacological approach&#xD;
           in different categories of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The general description of the study The study is a clinical trial, single-centered&#xD;
           (Jewish General Hospital, Montreal, Quebec), non-randomized, controlled, superiority&#xD;
           trial, open, intent-to-treat, with two parallel arms (intervention and control groups),&#xD;
           comparative (comparison of two groups of participants: Intervention group which will&#xD;
           have GIA painting sessions and control group will have usual care).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has been divided into two consecutive periods (i.e.; feasibility and full periods)&#xD;
      in order to increase the possibility to show the effects of GIA painting sessions by&#xD;
      measuring the right outcomes with the right tools and no lack of power analysis: The&#xD;
      feasibility period will last three-months, which will assess the feasibility of measures of&#xD;
      outcomes, estimate the magnitude of changes for the primary outcome of the study and the&#xD;
      number of sessions needed for a cycle of GIA painting. The full period will consist of the&#xD;
      open non-randomized clinical trial to determine effects of GIA painting sessions. This phase&#xD;
      will depend on the findings of the feasibility period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The population recruited in the study, will be older inpatients admitted in medicals wards of&#xD;
      Division of Geriatrics at Jewish General Hospital. Inclusion criteria are the following: age&#xD;
      of 65 years and older, cognitive impairment corresponding to a dementia from mild to severe&#xD;
      stage, regardless the etiology, admission in medicals ward of Division of Geriatrics at&#xD;
      Jewish General hospital, medically stable (i.e.; no acute organ failure) patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The population will be separated in two groups: Intervention group: participants who will&#xD;
      practice GIA painting session, and Control group: participants who will not practice GIA&#xD;
      painting sessions. All participants of this group will be matched on Age (± 3 years), sex,&#xD;
      reason for admission and cognitive impairment.&#xD;
