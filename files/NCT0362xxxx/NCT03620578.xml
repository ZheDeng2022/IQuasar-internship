  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prognosis of patients with &quot;high-grade B cell lymphoma with cellular myelocytomatosis&#xD;
      (MYC) and B cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) and/or B cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6) rearrangements&quot; (double&#xD;
      hit (DH)/triple hit (TH)-HGBL) with rituximab-CHOP (R-CHOP) is dismal as compared to patients&#xD;
      with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) without MYC, BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements.&#xD;
      Currently, there is no other standard first line treatment for these patients. Dose Adjusted&#xD;
      - Etoposide Prednisone Vincristine Cyclophosphamide Doxorubicin - Rituximab (DA-EPOCH-R) and&#xD;
      nivolumab are both feasible treatments. Nivolumab may induce auto-immune reactions.&#xD;
      DA-EPOCH-R may induce more hematological toxicity than R-CHOP. The hypothesis is that&#xD;
      addition of nivolumab to DA-EPOCH-R will contribute to increased survival.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The dismal prognosis of DH-DLBCL patients following standard therapy with R-CHOP (overall&#xD;
      survival at 2 years 35% for MYC+ vs 61% for MYC- patients) justifies upfront new treatment&#xD;
      approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Attempts have been made to improve prognosis of DH-DLBCL patients with intensified&#xD;
      chemotherapy schemes like DA-EPOCH-R, standard treatment of Burkitt lymphoma with high dose&#xD;
      multi-agent chemotherapy (R-CODOX-M/R-IVAC) and autologous stem cell transplantation. These&#xD;
      treatment schedules seem to prolong disease-free survival (DFS), but relapses do often occur&#xD;
      and improved OS has not been achieved. The investigators hypothesize to increase the number&#xD;
      of patients in complete remission with DA-EPOCH-R to 65% as compared to 50% for R-CHOP.&#xD;
      DA-EPOCH-R is a well-known scheme for the treatment of patients with Burkitt Lymphoma, and is&#xD;
      one of the treatment arms of the Hemato-Oncologie voor Volwassenen Nederland (HOVON) 127&#xD;
      protocol. For DH-DLBCL patients the investigators expect that it will improve the complete&#xD;
      remission (CR) rate and prolong DFS as compared to R-CHOP as has been shown in several&#xD;
      retrospective studies. It is also clear from these studies that relapses still occur and that&#xD;
      OS is not improved by chemotherapy only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators expect to induce deeper remission with DA-EPOCH-R providing the opportunity&#xD;
      for nivolumab to consolidate complete remission, prolong DFS, or to induce conversion of&#xD;
      minimal residual disease (MRD) positivity to MRD negativity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new approach underlying this proposal is to enhance anti-tumor immune responses.&#xD;
      Malignancies with MYC aberrations were long thought to be independent of immune responses.&#xD;
      However, recently it was shown that MYC expressing lymphoma and leukaemia mouse and human&#xD;
      cell lines upregulate programmed death-ligand 1 (PDL1) (&quot;don't find me&quot; signal) and CD47&#xD;
      (&quot;don't eat me&quot; signal) expression. Inactivation of MYC enhanced tumour immune responses in&#xD;
      vivo in mice. Moreover, a subset of DLBCL does express PDL1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No correlation with MYC rearrangements or protein expression has been described in these&#xD;
      studies; however, these data suggest that tumours with MYC overexpression may be especially&#xD;
      vulnerable to treatment with immune check point inhibitors, providing the rationale for&#xD;
      treatment with nivolumab.&#xD;
