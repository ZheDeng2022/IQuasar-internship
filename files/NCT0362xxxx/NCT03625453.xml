    <textblock>
      Two-part study consisting of a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, study at two&#xD;
      target dose levels (Part 1) and an open-label, non-randomized study (Part 2) to determine the&#xD;
      efficacy of ABX-1431 in treating adult patients with Tourette syndrome or Chronic Motor Tic&#xD;
      Disorder as measured by the change from baseline in Total Tic Score of the Yale Global Tic&#xD;
      Severity Scale (YGTSS-TTS) compared with placebo.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ABX-1431 is a potent and selective, orally available, irreversible inhibitor of&#xD;
      monoacylglycerol lipase, a metabolic enzyme that regulates the activity of the endogenous&#xD;
      cannabinoid (endocannabinoid) system. It is being developed as a potential first-in-class&#xD;
      compound for the treatment of Tourette Syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will assess the safety, tolerability, and effect on tics ABX-1431 in adults with&#xD;
      Tourette Syndrome or chronic motor tic disorder in an 8-week study. It is a two-part study.&#xD;
      Part 1 is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of ABX-1431 at two target dose&#xD;
      levels. Part 2 is an optional, open-label, non-randomized study of ABX-1431.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will participate in the main study (Part 1) for approximately 10 to 14 weeks (up to&#xD;
      30-day screening period; 56-day treatment period; 14-day follow-up period). For patients who&#xD;
      choose to participate in Part 2, there is a period of up to 4 weeks between the last study&#xD;
      visit in Part 1 and first study visit in Part 2. Patients who choose to enter Part 2 will be&#xD;
      treated with open-label ABX-1431 for an additional 6 weeks (28-day treatment period; 14-day&#xD;
      follow-up period).&#xD;

    <description>The Yale Global Tourette Severity Scale (YGTSS) is a clinician-completed rating scale to capture TS symptom severity. The number, frequency, intensity, complexity, and interference of both motor and vocal tics are rated on an ordinal scale between 0 and 5, with higher scores indicating greater severity. Motor and vocal tics subscales are reported (0 - 25) and then summed for a total tic score (TTS) (0 - 50). The TTS has been used as the registration endpoint for pharmacological therapies. The YGTSS has an Impairment subscale (0 - 50) which is then added for a total global score of 0 - 100.</description>

    <time_frame>Part 1: days 0, 14, 28, 42, 56; Part 2: days 0, 14, 28</time_frame>
    <description>The Adult Tic Questionnaire (ATQ) is a tic self-rating scale. The ATQ records the occurrence, frequency and intensity for any of 27 endorsed common motor and vocal tics. The occurrence is being indicated as 1 for a present tic or 0 if no tic has been experienced. Frequency is measured on a scale from 1 (weekly frequency or less) to 4 (constant tics, almost all the time during the day). Intensity is being rated on a scale of 1 - 4 with 1 representing mild tics and 4 strong tics. The ATQ will principally be analyzed by summing the product of the intensity (1-4) and frequency (1-4) to determine the severity (2-8) across all endorsed tics. For clarity, the number of each endorsed tic and the total of intensity and frequency across all tics may be separately analyzed by mixed-model repeated-measures. The clinical relevance of changes in the ATQ may also be presented by the change in the average intensity and frequency score.</description>

    <time_frame>Part 1: days 0, 14, 28, 42, 56; Part 2: days 0, 14, 28</time_frame>
    <description>The Premonitory Urge for Tics Scale (PUTS) is a patient self-assessment of the intensity of agreement of several statements describing the unpleasant qualities of premonitory feelings preceding tics. Each statement is being rated on a scale from 1 (not at all) to 4 (very much). The total score is being calculated by summing the single scores. The range of the total score is between 9, corresponding to a minimal intensity of premonitory urges for tics and 36, an extremely high intensity with probable severe impairment.</description>

    <description>The Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I) is a 7-point ordinal, clinician-rated scale used to assess patients' overall improvement in disease status relative to their condition at baseline. A rating of 1 indicates a very much improved condition, compared to the subject's prior condition, while a rating of 7 means a very much worse condition respectively.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient is a male or female ≥ 18 to 64 years of age at the Screening Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient has a diagnosis of Tourette Syndrome or Chronic Motor Tic Disorder as defined&#xD;
             by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5)&#xD;
             criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient's YGTSS-TTS results must be ≥ 22 (range 0-50) at the Baseline/Randomization&#xD;
             Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. At the Baseline/Randomization Visit patients must be taking a stable drug regimen for&#xD;
             tics and comorbidities for 30 days and must be expected to remain on a stable drug&#xD;
             regimen during this study. Patients receiving no medication for TS may participate.&#xD;
             Patients who have recently discontinued medication for tics must have discontinued&#xD;
             them for at least 30 days. For neuroleptic drugs (e.g., risperidone, aripiprazole),&#xD;
             the minimum discontinuation period is 30 days prior to the Baseline/Randomization&#xD;
             Visit. For injectable depot neuroleptic drugs the minimum discontinuation period is&#xD;
             one dosage cycle plus 14 days. (See Inclusion 'f' for discontinuation period of&#xD;
             cannabinoid medication in patients using these products for tics.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patient is legally competent, has been informed of the nature and scope of relevance&#xD;
             for the study, voluntarily agrees to participation, agrees to the study restrictions,&#xD;
             and has signed the informed consent form (ICF) approved by the Ethics Review Committee&#xD;
             (ERC).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients using cannabinoid medications for their tics must discontinue their use at&#xD;
             least 14 days prior to the Baseline/Randomization Visit. The investigator and patient&#xD;
             must be confident that these patients will not require these medications for the&#xD;
             duration of the study until 14 days after the last dose of study medication. Examples&#xD;
             of cannabinoids include cannabis in any form, nabilone or Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol&#xD;
             (THC)-containing medications such as nabiximols (Sativex®) or dronabinol. The use of&#xD;
             recreational cannabinoids during this study is not permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Female patients of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test [serum&#xD;
             or urine human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)] at the Screening Visit and other&#xD;
             indicated visits. They must practice a highly effective, reliable, and medically&#xD;
             approved contraceptive regimen during the study (e.g., theoretical failure rate less&#xD;
             than 1% per year as described in the 2014 Heads of Medicines Agencies: Clinical Trials&#xD;
             Facilitation Group report on contraception in clinical trials, which include oral or&#xD;
             parenteral or implanted hormonal contraception, vaginal ring releasing hormonal&#xD;
             contraception (e.g., Nuvaring, intrauterine device, or intrauterine system).&#xD;
             Post-menopausal women may enter this study. Post-menopausal women are defined as those&#xD;
             without menses in the past 12 months, and with a serum follicle stimulating hormone&#xD;
             (FSH) in the post-menopausal range. Women who are surgically sterile may enter this&#xD;
             study with written documentation of the surgical procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Male patients must be willing to use a condom with sexual partners during this study&#xD;
             until 14 days after the last dose of study medication. Male patients must be willing&#xD;
             to abstain from sperm donation for 3 months after the completion of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient is taking strong inducers or inhibitors of cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A4/5 or&#xD;
             CYP2C9. Examples of strong CYP3A4/5 inducers include carbamazepine, efavirenz,&#xD;
             nevirapine, barbiturates, pioglitazone, modafinil, enzalutamide, oxcarbazepine,&#xD;
             rifampicin, St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum), and phenytoin. Examples of potent&#xD;
             CYP3A4/5 inhibitors include atazanavir, boceprevir, clarithromycin, grapefruit juice,&#xD;
             indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, suboxone, nelfinavir, posaconazole,&#xD;
             ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, and voriconazole. Examples of CYP2C9 strong&#xD;
             inducers/inhibitors include carbamazepine, enzalutamide, fluconazole, valproic acid,&#xD;
             phenobarbital, nevirapine, rifampicin, and St. John's Wort.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient has evidence of alcohol abuse or dependence, as defined by the DSM-5 criteria,&#xD;
             with two or more of the 11 criteria at the Screening Visit or within 1 year before the&#xD;
             Screening Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient has evidence of drug or chemical abuse (except nicotine), as defined by the&#xD;
             DSM-5 criteria, at the Screening Visit or within 1 year before the Screening Visit.&#xD;
             Patient has evidence of marijuana or cannabis dependency or has been treated for&#xD;
             cannabis dependency, as defined by DSM-5 criteria, at the Screening Visit or within 1&#xD;
             year before the Screening Visit. (Patients who are prescribed stimulants should not be&#xD;
             assessed for Stimulant Use Disorder. Patients who use cannabinoid-based medicine&#xD;
             (e.g., cannabis in any form, nabilone, or THC-containing medications) for treatment of&#xD;
             Tourette Syndrome with the investigator's knowledge should not be assessed for&#xD;
             Cannabis Use Disorder, but these patients must comply with abstinence requirements for&#xD;
             this study (See Inclusion 'f')). Patients who have a positive urine drug screen at the&#xD;
             Screening Visit for drugs other than those allowed, as indicated in this criterion,&#xD;
             are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patient is unwilling to comply with study restrictions including abstinence from&#xD;
             cannabis and alcohol from the Baseline/Randomization Visit until the follow-up&#xD;
             telephone call 14 days after the last dose of study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients receiving ongoing psychological therapy for tics such as Habit Reversal&#xD;
             Training or Comprehensive Behavioral Intervention for Tics are excluded. Patients who&#xD;
             have completed behavioral therapy for tics at least 30 days before the&#xD;
             Baseline/Randomization Visit may participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patient is a lactating or pregnant female, or a female who intends to become pregnant&#xD;
             within 90 days following the last dose of study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patient has one or more of the following laboratory results at the Screening Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Aspartate transaminase (AST) &gt; 3 x upper limit of normal (ULN)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Alanine transaminase (ALT) &gt; 3 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total bilirubin &gt; 2 x ULN (unless due to Gilbert's syndrome)&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patient has an estimated creatinine clearance less than 60 mL/minute at the Screening&#xD;
             Visit. Creatinine clearance (Clcr) is estimated by the Cockcroft-Gault (C-G) equation&#xD;
             from a spot serum creatinine (mg/dL) determination using the following formula:&#xD;
&#xD;
             CLcr (mL/min) = [140 - age (years)] × weight (kg) / 72 × serum creatinine (mg/dL)] ×&#xD;
             [0.85 for female patients]&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patient has a serum albumin level below the laboratory normal range at the Screening&#xD;
             Visit, and the physician cannot rule out hepatic insufficiency based on consideration&#xD;
             of clinical symptoms, clinical signs, and other laboratory tests. (The physician may&#xD;
             decide that a low value of a serum albumin is clinically insignificant or the test may&#xD;
             be repeated.)&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patient has symptomatic chronic Hepatitis B and/or Hepatitis C Virus infection.&#xD;
             Asymptomatic seropositive individuals without clinical or clinical laboratory&#xD;
             manifestations of hepatitis may be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Patient has a clinically significant abnormality on the ECG at the Screening Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Patients with a history of cancer will be excluded, with two exceptions: Patients with&#xD;
             a history of squamous or basal cell carcinoma of the skin treated with documented&#xD;
             success of curative therapy &gt; 3 months may be enrolled. Patients with cancer and in&#xD;
             remission with no treatment for at least 2 years prior to the Screening Visit may be&#xD;
             enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Patient has Tourette Syndrome or Chronic Motor Tic Disorder and also has mental&#xD;
             retardation, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), dystonia, or post-traumatic stress&#xD;
             disorder (PTSD). Mental retardation may be defined by medical history. (If the&#xD;
             patient's available medical history is unclear, the investigator may use any validated&#xD;
             screening test such as the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI-II); an&#xD;
             intelligence quotient &lt; 80 (well below average) is an exclusion). ASD and PTSD may be&#xD;
             determined by medical history. (If the patient's available medical history is unclear,&#xD;
             the investigator may use the diagnostic criteria for ASD and PTSD, as defined by the&#xD;
             DSM-5.)&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Patient has confounding medical conditions such as active infection, primary or&#xD;
             acquired immunodeficiency (HIV testing is not mandated), uncontrolled diabetes (i.e.,&#xD;
             known Type 1 or 2 diabetes with most recent HbA1c level &gt; 9.0% or has not had an HbA1c&#xD;
             measurement within past 12 months), clinically significant cardiac disease (i.e.,&#xD;
             significant cardiac conduction abnormalities, uncontrolled hypertension, myocardial&#xD;
             infarction, cardiac arrhythmia or unstable angina &lt; 6 months to enrollment, New York&#xD;
             Heart Association (NYHA) Grade II or greater congestive heart failure, serious cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia requiring medication, Grade II or greater peripheral vascular disease, and&#xD;
             history of cerebrovascular accident within 6 months), clinically significant renal&#xD;
             disease (e.g., acute kidney injury (e.g., hematuria, oligouria, or an acute rise in&#xD;
             serum creatinine of ≥ 0.5 mg / dL (≥ 44 umol/L)) or chronic kidney disease defined by&#xD;
             estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt; 60 ml / min or oligouria), or any suspected&#xD;
             hepatic insufficiency. (See Exclusions 'g' 'h' and 'i' for laboratory test exclusion&#xD;
             limits.) Physicians should rely on the medical history, physical examination, and&#xD;
             protocol specified laboratory tests to exclude individuals with these conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Patient has a diagnosis of any psychiatric comorbidity such obsessive compulsive&#xD;
             disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety disorder, and/or&#xD;
             depression and has undergone a change in therapy in the 30 days before the&#xD;
             Baseline/Randomization Visit or is in need of a change in treatment. Patients with&#xD;
             stable obsessive compulsive disorder or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or&#xD;
             depression requiring no alteration in therapy may be enrolled. Patients with a past&#xD;
             history of psychosis or schizophrenia at any time are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Patient has a history of suicidal ideation with intent to act or a plan to act, or a&#xD;
             suicide attempt in the last 3 years preceding the Baseline/Randomization Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Patient has participated in an investigational study for medications with the last&#xD;
             visit within 1 month for a non-biologic agent and 90 days for a biologic agent of the&#xD;
             Baseline/Randomization Visit. The total volume of blood donated in the past 56 days&#xD;
             may not exceed 450 mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Patient is an employee of the investigative site or sponsor or a close relative of an&#xD;
             employee of the investigative site.&#xD;
