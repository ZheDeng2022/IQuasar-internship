    <textblock>
      Patients with refractory or relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) after two courses of&#xD;
      standard chemotherapy regimens have very limited options. Further chemotherapy is associated&#xD;
      with significant toxicity and is generally ineffective. About 10-30% patients with AML carry&#xD;
      a gain-of-function mutation of a gene known as Flt3 in the leukemic cells, conferring them&#xD;
      with abnormal cellular proliferation. Sorafenib is a multi-kinase inhibitor which was&#xD;
      licensed in Hong Kong for the treatment of advanced hepatocellular and renal cell carcinoma.&#xD;
      The drug has also been shown to be effective against Flt3 and AML but it has not been&#xD;
      licensed for use in this condition.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AML is one of the most lethal cancers among young people in Hong Kong. Induction chemotherapy&#xD;
      is the mainstay of treatment, resulting in remission (i.e. clearance of leukemic cells) in&#xD;
      70% cases. Patients who fail induction chemotherapy or who relapse after initial remission&#xD;
      would need to receive further chemotherapy with a view to achieve a second remission. Those&#xD;
      who do so can be potentially cured by bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Those who fail are&#xD;
      left with very little options. As a result, only 30% patients can survive long-term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AML is heterogeneous and 10-30% patients carry a gain-of-function mutation of a gene known as&#xD;
      fms-related tyrosine kinase-3 (Flt3) in the leukemic cells, which confers them with abnormal&#xD;
      cellular proliferation. These patients have inferior prognosis compared with those without&#xD;
      the mutation. With conventional chemotherapy, these leukemias often fail to remit, precluding&#xD;
      patients from receiving curative BMT. Sorafenib is a multi-kinase inhibitor which is FDA&#xD;
      approved for the treatment of metastatic hepatocellular and renal cell carcinomas. It is also&#xD;
      effective against Flt3 and has been shown to be very effective in inducing remission in&#xD;
      patients with AML carrying Flt3 mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposal aims to treat relapsed or refractory AML patients carrying Flt3 mutation in the&#xD;
      following ways:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients who have persistent or refractory leukemia after at least two prior&#xD;
           chemotherapy regimens will receive sorafenib to induce a remission, hence bridging them&#xD;
           to BMT for curative treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients who relapse after BMT will receive sorafenib to induce remission again in&#xD;
           preparation for second BMT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients who are not candidates for BMT but have persistent or refractory leukemia after&#xD;
           at least two prior chemotherapy regimens will receive sorafenib to induce a remission,&#xD;
           followed by chemotherapy consolidation. Sorafenib induction will have significantly less&#xD;
           side-effects compared with induction by conventional chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are treated with sorafenib will be managed in the hospital and out-patient&#xD;
      clinics in the same way as patients undergoing induction by conventional chemotherapy. They&#xD;
      will have bone marrow examinations before and one month after receiving sorafenib treatment&#xD;
