      The overall purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of the introduction of a&#xD;
      shelter cat into the family of a child with Autism Spectrum Disorder on the social skills and&#xD;
      anxiety of the child, and to examine stress in the cat.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many families in the United States live with cats as companion animals, including families of&#xD;
      children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). One in 68 children are diagnosed with ASD.&#xD;
      There is no cure for ASD, and no one treatment works for all children. Symptoms of ASD&#xD;
      include a lack of social skills and anxiety. Companion animals have been helpful for children&#xD;
      with ASD. However, no one has studied stress of cats living in families of children with ASD.&#xD;
      This study will place 64 pre-screened shelter cats in pre-screened homes and monitor the&#xD;
      stress of the cats. Cats ages 10 months to four years that have been screened for calm&#xD;
      behavior using a temperament, test will be adopted by families in the study. Families will&#xD;
      also be screened for pet issues. No cat will be placed in a home with a child who has a&#xD;
      history of aggression to animals. The study will also examine the social skills and anxiety&#xD;
      of the children with ASD, and bonding of the parents and children with their cats. Five to&#xD;
      eight million dogs and cats are relinquished to animal shelters in the United States each&#xD;
      year. Thirty-eight percent of cats are given up for behavioral reasons. Studying cat stress&#xD;
      and the placement of cats, with calm and non-aggressive characteristics into homes of&#xD;
      families of children with ASD may help shed light on the likely success of the relationships&#xD;
      between shelter cats and these families.&#xD;
