  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The PaGoPsA study objective is to ascertain if guideline-based psoriatic arthritis clinical&#xD;
      care achieves individual patient goals as articulated by patients, and to identify predictors&#xD;
      of achieving individual patient goals from psoriatic arthritis treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a heterogeneous autoimmune disease that occurs in one in three&#xD;
      people with the skin disease psoriasis. PsA can cause arthritis (joint inflammation),&#xD;
      enthesitis (tendon and ligament inflammation), sausage digits (swollen entire finger or toe),&#xD;
      spondyloarthritis (spinal inflammation). Skin involvement by psoriasis is also highly&#xD;
      variable in terms of psoriasis type and location. Through combined skin and musculoskeletal&#xD;
      involvement, psoriatic disease has a significant life impact with decrease quality of life&#xD;
      including uncomfortable symptoms, ability to participate in life and functioning. Medications&#xD;
      used to treat PsA have sometimes an uneven effect on the various PsA manifestations where&#xD;
      some are more effective for skin while others more effective for the joints. In this context,&#xD;
      clinical care and treatment of PsA is a complex process which balances disease activity with&#xD;
      medication risks and benefits as well as patient priorities. Professional PsA treatments&#xD;
      guidelines state that PsA treatment goals are disease remission or low disease activity.&#xD;
      Several studies to date have shown that physicians tend to overestimate remission and low&#xD;
      disease activity in PsA patients when compared to disease activity indices. Also patients and&#xD;
      physicians frequently do not align on perceptions of remission or low disease activity. In&#xD;
      the proposed study the investigators aim to identify predictors of successful treatment from&#xD;
      a patient perspective on a range of disease measures including psoriasis, arthritis,&#xD;
      enthesitis, dactylitis, patient reported outcomes, and laboratory assessments which are&#xD;
      routinely collected in the clinical care of PsA. Secondary endpoints are to quantify&#xD;
      longitudinally how stable a state of treatment success is from a patient perspective, and to&#xD;
      define score ranges for disease measurements, including health-related quality of life&#xD;
      measures, that correspond to treatment success from a patient perspective. The impact of this&#xD;
      research is that the investigators will be able to define parameters predictive of achieving&#xD;
      treatment success from a patient perspective, which will then inform goals of care for&#xD;
      psoriatic arthritis.&#xD;
