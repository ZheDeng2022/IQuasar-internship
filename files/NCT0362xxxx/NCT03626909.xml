      In this study, the investigators will be using a smartphone application that the&#xD;
      investigators developed to guide community health workers through the clinical assessment of&#xD;
      patients with diabetes including collection of demographic data and past medical history,&#xD;
      assessment of medication history, adherence, and adverse effects, measurement of glycemic&#xD;
      control, screening for complications, medication administration and titration, and patient&#xD;
      counseling.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The burden of chronic adult diseases is surging worldwide, particularly type 2 diabetes, the&#xD;
      prevalence of which is expected to double by 2030. The diabetes epidemic will primarily&#xD;
      impact developing countries, with 80% of adult cases occurring in low- and middle-income&#xD;
      countries (LMICs). Because many LMICs currently face a shortage of health professionals, the&#xD;
      increasing burden of noncommunicable diseases, like type 2 diabetes, will tax already&#xD;
      strained health systems. Furthermore, because many LMIC health care systems were developed to&#xD;
      target acute illnesses and communicable disease, they are ill-prepared to treat and manage&#xD;
      chronic adult disease. The divergence between the growing burden of chronic disease and the&#xD;
      development of the health systems necessary to treat these diseases indicate the potential&#xD;
      for a grave health, economic, and human crisis in the following decades. The WHO has&#xD;
      consequently demanded that physicians designs systems providing &quot;Innovative Care for Chronic&#xD;
      Conditions&quot; to meet this challenge4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, existing tools may provide a foundation for solutions to this growing crisis.&#xD;
      Community Health Workers (CHWs, as known as health promoters) have become central to global&#xD;
      health strategies since the Alma Ata Declaration of 1978, particularly in regions with&#xD;
      physician shortages. In recent years, CHWs have had notable success in targeting childhood&#xD;
      disease, particularly malnutrition and diarrhea, and offer a growing variety of primary care&#xD;
      services. The success of these programs in providing consistent, sustainable care at the&#xD;
      local level implies that longitudinal treatment for chronic adult diseases could be provided&#xD;
      through parallel structures. While the treatment of chronic disease has become increasingly&#xD;
      complex, the proliferation of smartphone and tablets across the globe have raised hopes that&#xD;
      mobile health technology (mHealth) platforms can provide CHWs with algorithmic guidance on&#xD;
      assessing and treating a broader set of diseases. The potential use of mHealth is a&#xD;
      burgeoning field of global health research. The combination of CHWs and mHealth guidance may&#xD;
      provide a solution to the rise of chronic disease in regions with physician shortages and&#xD;
      weak health systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While many mHealth applications have been developed for Diabetes (over 1,000 are commercially&#xD;
      available), only a small percentage (7.6%) are targeted to providers - and even fewer to&#xD;
      providers in LMICs. Instead, these tools most commonly serve as tools for patient&#xD;
      self-management, patient education, and medication adherence. A handful of programs have&#xD;
      utilized smartphone technology to connect remote patients to health care workers in LMICs as&#xD;
      well as to provide clinical guidance to providers, but such programs have been minimal and&#xD;
      publications have been process oriented. In addition to improving diabetes care in the target&#xD;
      population, the project also seeks to add to the evidence for this approach by designing an&#xD;
      application-based algorithm that can assist CHWs in providing long-term diabetes care,&#xD;
      titrating first- and second-line oral diabetes medications, and identifying dangerous&#xD;
      diabetes complications in a setting of a lower middle-income country with a low physician&#xD;
      density.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test this delivery approach,the investigators focused on developing a diabetes treatment&#xD;
      program in San Lucas Tolim√°n, Guatemala. This program seeks to provide treatment to diabetics&#xD;
      living in the group of 19 rural villages with a combined population of 17,000, which surround&#xD;
      San Lucas. San Lucas is an ideal community for studying these topics because it is facing a&#xD;
      heavy burden of untreated Type II Diabetes, has medical personnel with mHealth experience,&#xD;
      and has a well-developed CHW program. This CHW program is sponsored by the San Lucas Mission&#xD;
      (SLM), an NGO providing health services in the area and a University of Wisconsin and&#xD;
      Stanford University partner organization. Local health workers describe the increase in Type&#xD;
      II Diabetes as an epidemic and there are few systems in place to provide community members&#xD;
      with diabetes screening or effective and consistent treatment. Startling regional data on&#xD;
      Type II Diabetes supports this concern: in Guatemala, the prevalence of diabetes has been&#xD;
      estimated at 9.1-9.4%, with over 40% of cases undiagnosed22-24. The prevalence of diabetes&#xD;
      has doubled over the past 30 years25. Fortunately, San Lucas has already developed a strong&#xD;
      CHW program, including a tablet-based mHealth application that targets early childhood&#xD;
      malnutrition, through a collaboration between the San Lucas Mission and Stanford School of&#xD;
      Medicine. This application has enhanced the successful malnutrition program, allowing CHWs to&#xD;
      more easily identify and manage malnutrition and decreasing training requirements for CHWs26.&#xD;
      Utilizing the existence of the CHW program infrastructure and the established mHealth&#xD;
      platform, the project seeks to develop and implement a CHW-led diabetes treatment program in&#xD;
      San Lucas that is assisted by a smartphone application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to inform the development of the smartphone application and program protocols, the&#xD;
      investigators conducted a community needs assessment during the summer of 2016. Clinical data&#xD;
      was used to provide a baseline estimate of diabetes prevalence and distribution in the&#xD;
      communities as well as demographic risk factors. Interviews were conducted with local&#xD;
      physicians, CHWs, and managers of the CHW system to understand current methods of diabetes&#xD;
      treatment and define the limitations of these systems. Out of the 119 patients currently&#xD;
      diagnosed with diabetes in the rural communities, 31 were interviewed to illuminate how the&#xD;
      disease is currently diagnosed and treated, the effect the disease has on patient lifestyles,&#xD;
      and patients' desired attributes for a diabetes treatment program. Finally,the investigators&#xD;
      visited local diabetes clinics to determine the current state of diabetes treatment, the&#xD;
      availability of medications and resources, and the level of care provided to patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key findings of the community needs assessment were as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients with diabetes in the rural communities have poor access to quality diabetes&#xD;
           care. Only 58% of patients are taking medication on a regular basis and only 13% have&#xD;
           achieved good glycemic control&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Outreach clinics run by CHWs are disorganized, undersupplied, sporadic, and ineffective&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. CHWs lack the experience and training to effectively titrate oral diabetes medications,&#xD;
           assess for possible complications, and provide health education for patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Patients lack basic diabetes knowledge, particularly regarding self-management&#xD;
&#xD;
      Utilizing the knowledge gained with this needs assessment, established treatment guidelines&#xD;
      for diabetes, and the expertise of SLM medical director Dr. Rafael Tun and the coordinators&#xD;
      the SLM CHW program, the investigators developed protocols for the diabetes program,&#xD;
      including a smartphone application to allow for algorithmic management. This process was&#xD;
      iterative and collaborative and involved local partners at every step.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators then trained a group of 10 CHWs, including 5 CHW coordinators (who have&#xD;
      more clinical experience and take on a supervisory and training role for less-experienced&#xD;
      CHWs) in the basics of diabetes management, program protocols, and the use of the smartphone&#xD;
      application the investigators had developed. With close physician supervision, the&#xD;
      investigators have beta-tested the use of the application with a small group of patients.&#xD;
      Based on this experience, the investigators have further refined the application and program&#xD;
      protocols. The investigators now endeavor to implement this program on a wide scale in the&#xD;
      San Lucas area to both improve access to care for patients with diabetes and to establish the&#xD;
      efficacy, feasibility, and safety of CHW-led, smartphone application-guided diabetes&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An overview of study activities is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The investigators will train additional CHWs in basic diabetes care, use of&#xD;
           point-of-care (POC) testing technology, and use of the smartphone application that will&#xD;
           guide their management of patients with diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CHWs will recruit patients with diabetes in the rural villages outside of San Lucas to&#xD;
           participate in the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the enrollment visit, CHWs will use the smartphone application to screen patients for&#xD;
           appropriate inclusion in the program, establish glycemic targets, assess current&#xD;
           glycemic control with hemoglobin A1c and blood glucose, measure height, weight, blood&#xD;
           pressure, and waist circumference, assess for the presence of diabetes complications&#xD;
           (diabetic ulcers, angina, diabetic eye disease), administer oral medications (metformin&#xD;
           and/or glyburide, known locally by its alternate name glibenclamide) based on a&#xD;
           medication dosing algorithm, and provide diabetes self-management education.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CHWs will meet with patients on a monthly basis to assess medication adherence and for&#xD;
           adverse effects, glycemic control (with blood glucose), screen for diabetic&#xD;
           complications, refill medications with titration as needed (if experiencing medication&#xD;
           adverse effects or blood glucose is significantly above or below treatment goals), and&#xD;
           provide further diabetes education. Again, these activities will be guided by the&#xD;
           smartphone application. Every 3 months, the monthly visit will also include A1c&#xD;
           measurement for a more definitive measurement of diabetes control and to allow for&#xD;
           titration of medications. Patients who are identified as having complications or who are&#xD;
           not meeting treatment goals despite maximal dosing of metformin and glibenclamide&#xD;
           allowed by the algorithm will be referred to SLM medical director Dr. Rafael Tun for&#xD;
           definitive management.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After all visits, including enrollment and monthly visits, Dr. Tun, in addition to the&#xD;
           study investigators, will review data for all patients seen, including treatment&#xD;
           recommendations made by the application and carried out by the CHWs, and make any&#xD;
           changes to the treatment plan as needed based on his clinical judgement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mean hemoglobin A1c and proportion of patients meeting treatment goals (primary&#xD;
           endpoints) will be assessed at 6 months and compared to baseline, in addition to a&#xD;
           number of secondary endpoints and safety measures as described in the relevant sections&#xD;
           of this protocol. If possible, patients will also be followed out to 12 months with&#xD;
           reassessment of primary and secondary endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SLM hopes to continue this rural diabetes treatment program indefinitely, with the&#xD;
           results of this study informing a quality improvement process to ensure the provision of&#xD;
           high quality care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators believe that the novel aspect of this intervention, the use of a smartphone&#xD;
      application to guide treatment decisions, improves on previous protocol-driven approaches in&#xD;
      several ways. The use of a mobile computer-based algorithm as opposed to a paper algorithm&#xD;
      allows for greater complexity and the incorporation of additional factors relevant to patient&#xD;
      safety, such as the patient's current dose of medication, medication adherence, and&#xD;
      medication side effects, in order to provide more specific recommendations. In this way, it&#xD;
      decreases the cognitive burden placed on CHWs and the potential for human error. Rather than&#xD;
      having to follow a complicated paper flowchart, CHWs will input information into the&#xD;
      smartphone application, which will process the data and present the CHW with a concrete&#xD;
      recommendation. Additionally, a computer-based system allows for easier review by the&#xD;
      supervising physician and auditing and analysis of both program process measures and&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While CHWs will be acting on recommendations from the smartphone application without direct&#xD;
      physician supervision at that moment, they will in essence be acting on &quot;standing orders&quot;&#xD;
      from the physician because the treatment algorithms were designed by physicians and approved&#xD;
      by the SLM medical director. CHWs will also be able to obtain point-of-care treatment&#xD;
      recommendations from the medical director via telephone if there are questions about&#xD;
      application recommendations or if a situation arises that falls outside the scope of the&#xD;
      protocols.&#xD;
