  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      200 adolescent rugby players (aged 15-19) from the Senior Cup Teams of 5 Rugby Playing&#xD;
      schools (Members of Irish Schools Rugby) will be invited to enroll for inclusion in the&#xD;
      study. The study will collect data on brain health, including computer based skill testing,&#xD;
      eye tracking and balance and on task completion, cover existing tests in the established SCAT&#xD;
      3 alongside response to exercise testing and a clinical examination including baseline blood&#xD;
      tests known to influence recovery from concussion in a rugby playing population of adolescent&#xD;
      schoolboys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial data will be taken before the 2016/2017 season starts. The volume of rugby&#xD;
      training and match play will be recorded along with activity monitoring in general. For those&#xD;
      subjects who sustain concussion a dedicated clinic will provide all after care including&#xD;
      repeat clinical examination and magnetic resonance imaging along with a graduated return to&#xD;
      exercise and a compressive rehabilitation programme at Sports Surgery Clinic (SSC). A&#xD;
      Consultant Sports Physician will manage the return to play programme with an exercise,&#xD;
      cognitive, balance, eye movement and neck strength programme.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Concussion is a traumatic injury to the brain and is a common condition in those athletes who&#xD;
      play a contact sport, such as Rugby Union. It is a complex process in which forces are&#xD;
      transmitted to the brain and result in temporary impairment of brain function. Governing&#xD;
      bodies have done much good work to improve the recognition of concussion and the removal of&#xD;
      those players from the field but there still remains much confusion and a lack of data on&#xD;
      what measures can be used to help manage the return to school and play after a concussion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently assessment and management of concussion relies heavily on subjective symptom&#xD;
      analysis with little in the way of objective measures to help make decisions on diagnosis and&#xD;
      safe return to play time frames. There is growing evidence for objective measures of&#xD;
      cognition, balance, oculomotor, brain imaging, blood biomarkers and exercise physiology in&#xD;
      assisting with concussion diagnosis and management. The importance of the study is to decide&#xD;
      on the minimum level of tracking of pre season data to safely enhance the care for rugby&#xD;
      playing schoolboys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preseason Baseline assessment (all participants)&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be invited to complete a preseason screening session at SSC comprising:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Online questionnaire including past medical history; playing and injury history; sleep,&#xD;
           mood, stress, depression, anxiety, QoL assessments; symptom checklist; and predictive&#xD;
           and modifying factor analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Computerised cognitive assessment: Participants will be screened at baseline using The&#xD;
           Axon Sports Baseline Test: a preseason screening test that measures baseline reaction&#xD;
           time, learning and memory skills, attention, concentration and problem solving capacity,&#xD;
           which can be used in conjunction with The Axon Sports After Injury Test following a&#xD;
           suspected concussion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. King-Devick Test: An objective method of evaluating visual tracking and saccades (quick,&#xD;
           simultaneous movements of both eyes). It involves reading aloud a series of single digit&#xD;
           numbers from left to right on three test cards. Participants are asked to read the&#xD;
           numbers on each card from left to right as quickly as possible but without making any&#xD;
           errors. The sum of the three test card time scores constitutes the summary score for the&#xD;
           entire test. The test cards become progressively more difficult to read due to&#xD;
           variability of spacing between the numbers. Both errors in reading and speed of reading&#xD;
           are included in deriving a score.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Vestibulo-ocular Assessment using ICS Impulse Goggles: The goggles are light-weight USB&#xD;
           goggles with a disposable face cushion that allow accurate assessment of oculomotor and&#xD;
           vestibular function with accuracy by recording eye movement in response to testing&#xD;
           stimulus. The participant will be asked to put on the goggles and make sure they are&#xD;
           tight but comfortable. They will then be instructed through a series of tests, some of&#xD;
           the tests being performed with vision denied. The total testing time will take&#xD;
           approximately 5-10 minutes, depending on symptoms onset. The data is collected by the&#xD;
           software programme that comes with the ICS Impulse goggles and can be formulated using&#xD;
           Excel format and directly uploaded onto the participant's file.&#xD;
&#xD;
           (I) Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV) is a common clinical vestibular&#xD;
           dysfunction that can be diagnosed using the head impulse test (vHIT). The test provides&#xD;
           quick, clear-cut side of lesion specific assessment of the vestibuloocular reflex&#xD;
           response to stimuli in the high-frequency range, the natural range of head movements. It&#xD;
           is the only test that can assess all six semicircular canals of the inner ear. ICS&#xD;
           Impulse is the world's first vHIT device to combine gold-standard accuracy with&#xD;
           unrivaled patient comfort. This test takes 2 minutes to complete unless the patient&#xD;
           becomes symptomatic. In this instance, it is appropriate to wait until nystagmus&#xD;
           symptoms resolve before moving head position.&#xD;
&#xD;
           (II) Oculomotor dysfunction can be assessed using the ICS Impluse Goggles which can help&#xD;
           to differentiate between a central or peripheral cause. The three common tests look at&#xD;
           are: (i) gaze stability to monitor the eye's ability to focus and stabilize by&#xD;
           identifying nystagmus that is evoked without stimulus; (ii) VOR tests provide the&#xD;
           ability to assess the vestibulo-ocular reflex by identifying the presence or absence of&#xD;
           saccadic eye movement in order to simultaneously test for the co-existence of vestibular&#xD;
           and cerebellar pathology and thus diagnose vetibuo-cerebellar disease; and (iii) Skew&#xD;
           Deviation test provides the ability to diagnose central disorder primarily brainstem by&#xD;
           assessing the patient's ocular alignment using a cover-uncover test with the goggles.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Each test takes approximately 1 minute to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Balance assessment: Balance Error Scoring System, as per current SCAT 3 This test will&#xD;
           consist of three twenty second tests with different stances.&quot; (I) double leg stance (II)&#xD;
           Single leg stance (III) Tandem stance&#xD;
&#xD;
           Each of the 20-second trials is scored by counting the errors or deviations from the&#xD;
           proper stance by the participant. The examiner will begin counting errors only after the&#xD;
           individual has assumed the proper start position. The modified BESS is calculated by&#xD;
           adding one error point for each error during the three 20-second tests. The maximum&#xD;
           total number of errors for any single condition is 10. If a participant commits multiple&#xD;
           errors simultaneously, only one error is recorded but the participant should quickly&#xD;
           return to the testing position and counting should resume once subject is set. Subjects&#xD;
           that are unable to maintain the testing procedure for a minimum of five seconds at the&#xD;
           start are assigned the highest possible score, ten, for that testing condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Neck Strength Testing (I) Cervical range of motion will be assessed in three planes of&#xD;
           reference (sagittal, frontal and transverse) using the Cervical Range of Motion&#xD;
           Instrument (Performance Attainment Associates, Minnesota, USA), which has been validated&#xD;
           in various populations. The participant will be seated on a static chair with adjustable&#xD;
           height so that the hips, knee and feet are positioned at 90Â°, and the head placed in the&#xD;
           neutral anatomic position. An initial warm-up and familiarisation session practicing all&#xD;
           movements to be assessed (flexion, extension, lateral flexion and rotation) will be&#xD;
           performed. Upon instruction, the participant will move their head in the test parameter&#xD;
           (looking directly ahead) and hold the end of range position to allow the recording of&#xD;
           the angle achieved, following which, the individual will return their head to the&#xD;
           neutral position. Three separate measures will be made in each direction, the mean of&#xD;
           which will be reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
           (II) Isometric cervical muscle testing is well validated. Maximal voluntary isometric&#xD;
           cervical muscle strength in three planes of reference will be assessed with a&#xD;
           custom-built device that includes a head harness from Gatherer Systems, a force&#xD;
           transducer that is connected to a load cell and bespoke software system. The test will&#xD;
           be performed employing a protocol specifically validated in young rugby players,&#xD;
           subjecting the neck to manually controlled linear incremental loading to test positional&#xD;
           failure in the absence of pain or neurological symptoms (which stops the test). The head&#xD;
           is to be held in the neutral anatomic position at all times throughout the test. Peak&#xD;
           isometric force will be logged at the point of head movement with loss of test position.&#xD;
           Loading will be applied and data will be recorded at 20Hz. Peak isometric force&#xD;
           generated by the musculature will be defined as the maximal load recorded during the&#xD;
           test procedure. An average of 3 tests will be reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Accusway Balance assessment: The AMTI Accusway system for balance and postural sway&#xD;
           measurement (Advanced Mechanical Technology, Inc., Watertown, Massachusetts) will be&#xD;
           used for collecting the data. The Accusway system consists of a portable force platform&#xD;
           and SWAYWIN software for data acquisition and analysis. The system measures ground&#xD;
           reaction force and moments in 3 orthogonal directions with a sampling frequency of 50&#xD;
           Hz. These provide the COP coordinates, which enables the calculation of the maximum&#xD;
           displacement in the anterior-posterior and medial-lateral direction (Max-AP; Max-ML),&#xD;
           the root-mean-square amplitude in anterior-posterior and medial-lateral direction from&#xD;
           the centroid in x- and y-axis (RMS-AP; RMS-ML), the mean velocity (MV) and the area of&#xD;
           the 95th percentile ellipse (AoE).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The participant will be asked to stand barefooted, double-legged stance on the platform.&#xD;
           Because changes in the Base of Support (BOS) have a substantial effect on postural&#xD;
           control; the outlines of both feet will be marked on the plastic cover with a permanent&#xD;
           marker in order to obtain standardised individual foot positions for the repeated&#xD;
           measurements. After leaving the platform, the individual's BOS will be entered in the&#xD;
           Accusway Plus system. Maximal BOS width and hip width, measured at the major trochanter&#xD;
           femoris, were recorded with an anthropometric caliper (Lafayette Instrument Company,&#xD;
           Lafayette, IN).&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Exercise Challenge Test (ECT) using the University of Buffalo Protocol: The ECT consists&#xD;
           of an incremental treadmill exercise test following a standard Balke protocol until&#xD;
           symptom exacerbation or voluntary exhaustion. The treadmill speed is set at 3.3mph at&#xD;
           0.0% incline. After 1 minute the grade increases to 2.0% while maintaining the same&#xD;
           speed. At the start of the third minute and each minute thereafter, the grade increases&#xD;
           by 1%, maintaining the speed at 3.3mph. In addition to frequent heart rate and blood&#xD;
           pressure readings and close observation by a therapist, athletes are asked every minute&#xD;
           while on the treadmill whether they are experiencing any worsening symptoms. Exercise&#xD;
           testing is terminated if symptom exacerbation occurs or the athlete reaches exhaustion&#xD;
           (defined by a rate of perceived exertion). Athletes who exercise to voluntary exhaustion&#xD;
           without symptom exacerbation are considered ready for RTP. All tests will be performed&#xD;
           by medical staff trained in CPR with access to full resuscitation equipment as per SSC&#xD;
           protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Activity and sleep monitoring (post Concussion Only) - each participant will be given a&#xD;
           Fitbit Activity Monitor which uses a three-dimensional accelerometer to sense user&#xD;
           movement. The sensor tracks steps taken and combines it with user data to calculate&#xD;
           distance walked, calories burned, floors climbed and activity duration and intensity. It&#xD;
           also measures sleep quality by tracking periods of restlessness, how long it takes the&#xD;
           wearer to fall asleep and how long they are actually asleep. The data collected will be&#xD;
           downloaded at each subsequent visit to SSC.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Haematology: Blood will be drawn, labelled and prepared for freezing, and only&#xD;
           subsequently analysed. This will be performed by experienced venipuncture staff with&#xD;
           full PPE and aseptic technique skills. Testing will occur as per SSC Hospital policy.&#xD;
           Blood will be stored in a standardized fashion at -80 degrees C for subsequent analysis&#xD;
           and novel biomarker discovery programmes. In athletes diagnosed with concussion a&#xD;
           detailed profile will be assessed including NFL, NSE, UCH-L1, MBP, S100B, GFAP and Tau&#xD;
           protein on the baseline samples. The blood samples will also have genetic analysis&#xD;
           performed to look for genes which are thought to influence outcome and recovery from&#xD;
           head injury (APO-E). This will be carried out on de-identified samples and will have no&#xD;
           long-term implications for the participants. All blood testing will be retrospective and&#xD;
           anonymous and will be used for comparison pre and post concussion. Samples will be&#xD;
           destroyed 24 months after collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow Up of Initial Screening All participants will be given a written report on the day of&#xD;
      screening for their parents, themselves and their GP's.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A small proportion of asymptomatic individuals will likely be identified with abnormalities&#xD;
      on testing. Any abnormal results detected on MRI or other outcome measures will be followed&#xD;
      up by the SSC sports medicine team and where necessary, referral to neurologist or&#xD;
      neurosurgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A final report summary with de-identified results will be sent on completion of the study to&#xD;
      all schools&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post game assessment (all participants) Immediately following a match all participants will&#xD;
      be asked to complete an online symptom score and basic wellness questions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosing concussion The diagnosis of concussion will be made using the Zurich consensus&#xD;
      guidelines and the IRFU Guide to Concussion. A medical doctor must make the diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to attend St. Vincent's University Hospital Emergency Department&#xD;
      to be assessed by a senior doctor if:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. No medical doctor is available at a game or training session where a suspected&#xD;
           concussion takes place&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A participant sustains an injury and has a loss of consciousness, focal neurological&#xD;
           deficit, vomiting, worsening symptoms of concussion or participant, parent or coach is&#xD;
           concerned&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the diagnosis of concussion has been made and any urgent medical issues have been dealt&#xD;
      with then these athletes will enter the post concussion protocol described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants diagnosed with Concussion&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the participant has been diagnosed with concussion, reports new concussive symptoms or has&#xD;
      a cognitive deficit consistent with a concussion, then they will be assessed as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Online questionnaire including concussion symptoms scales: As above&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Computerised cognitive assessment: Participants will complete the Axon Sports After&#xD;
           Injury Test which can be compared to the Axon Sports Baseline Test&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. King-Devick Test: As above&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Vestibulo-ocular assessment using ICS Impulse Goggles: As above&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Balance assessment: As above&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Neck strength testing: As above&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Haematology: As above&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Activity and sleep monitoring - The data from the Fitbit Activity monitor will be&#xD;
           downloaded&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Exercise Challenge Test: Buffalo Protocol. As above&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Daily online wellness measurement and symptom profile&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to attend the SSC Concussion clinics where the post injury&#xD;
      assessment protocol will be followed by an assessment by the consultant sports &amp; exercise&#xD;
      medicine physician and where necessary, referral to a neurologist. Criteria for onward&#xD;
      referral to neurology include MRI changes from baseline, symptoms last longer than three&#xD;
      weeks, worsening symptoms or worsening neurology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be given a written report on the day of assessment for their parents,&#xD;
      themselves and their GP's.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following their assessment, the athletes will be provided with an individualized&#xD;
      rehabilitation programme involving return to school advice followed by a graduated return to&#xD;
      learn and ultimately return to sport programme. This is the standard accepted current best&#xD;
      treatment for concussion and is not considered an intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that a minimum of two medical assessments by the sports &amp; exercise medicine&#xD;
      consultant will be required during the recovery period (the initial assessment and the&#xD;
      pre-return to play assessment) and where necessary some of the outcome measures will need to&#xD;
      be repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Returning to play Readiness of athletes returning to play is a challenging issue. Informed by&#xD;
      the Zurich Consensus Guidelines the Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU) produced guidelines for&#xD;
      the safe return to play of rugby players. For athletes of this age group the guidelines&#xD;
      recommend a minimum rest period of 14days post-concussion. Initial emphasis must be on return&#xD;
      to learn. Following this, provided all symptoms have subsided, athletes may return to play if&#xD;
      their symptoms do not return during a stepwise programme of increasing intensity of physical&#xD;
      activity and contact, which includes light aerobic exercise, sport-specific exercise,&#xD;
      noncontact training drills and full-contact training. In this age group the minimum time out&#xD;
      of rugby before returning to play is 23 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Athletes participating in this study will adhere to the IRFU guidelines. The only deviation&#xD;
      from these guidelines will be the implementation of the Exercise Challenge Test (Buffalo&#xD;
      Protocol). This will be a necessary step to assess changes in performance post concussion. No&#xD;
      athlete will return to play before the recommended 23 days.&#xD;
