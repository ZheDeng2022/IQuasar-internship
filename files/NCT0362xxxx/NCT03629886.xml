  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to enable all subjects who received placebo in the HPV-039 study&#xD;
      (NCT00779766), to also receive GSK Biologicals' Human Papillomavirus (Types 16, 18) Vaccine,&#xD;
      Adsorbed. Safety data in terms of serious adverse events (SAEs), any adverse events&#xD;
      (AEs)/SAEs leading to premature discontinuation of the study, potential immune mediated&#xD;
      diseases (pIMDs) and pregnancies (and their outcomes) were collected during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, this study assessed the long term protective effect of the vaccine, in an&#xD;
      exploratory manner, in terms of rates of HPV-related (vaccine type) incident cervical&#xD;
      infection up to approximately 10 years after vaccination in subjects who participated in&#xD;
      HPV-039 study (NCT00779766).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment allocation depended on the randomization in the previous study i.e. only the&#xD;
      subjects from the control group of HPV-039 study received HPV vaccination in the current&#xD;
      study. Subjects who previously received the Human Papillomavirus (Types 16, 18) Vaccine,&#xD;
      Adsorbed in HPV-039 study did not receive vaccination in this study.&#xD;

    <measure>Incidence Rates of Incident Cervical Infection With HPV-16 and/or HPV-18 (by PCR) in HPV DNA Negative and Seronegative Subjects at Baseline in All Study Groups</measure>
    <time_frame>From Month 0 in HPV-039 (NCT00779766) study [at the Day after Dose 1 (out of 3 doses administered in HPV-039)] until Month 120 (corresponding to Day 1 in the current study)</time_frame>
    <description>The incidence rate (n/T) of incident cervical infection with HPV-16 and/or HPV-18 (per 100 Person-years rate) was calculated as the number of subjects reporting at least one event (n) in a group, over the sum of follow-up period expressed in years (T) in the same group, and multiplied by 100. Cervical infection caused by HPV Types 16 and 18 was assessed by detecting HPV DNA using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). For single HPV type: Subjects DNA negative at Month 0 and seronegative at Month 0 for the corresponding HPV type in study HPV 039 (NCT00779766). For combined HPV types: Subjects DNA negative at Month 0 and seronegative at Month 0 for at least one HPV type (subjects were in the analysis of at least one single type) in study HPV 039 (NCT00779766).</description>

        <description>The incidence rate (n/T) of incident cervical infection with HPV-16 and/or HPV-18 (per 100 Person-years rate) was calculated as the number of subjects reporting at least one event (n) in a group, over the sum of follow-up period expressed in years (T) in the same group, and multiplied by 100. Cervical infection caused by HPV Types 16 and 18 was assessed by detecting HPV DNA using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). For single HPV type: Subjects DNA negative at Month 0 and seronegative at Month 0 for the corresponding HPV type in study HPV 039 (NCT00779766).
