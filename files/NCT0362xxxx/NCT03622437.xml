  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With an increasing number of rectal cancer (RC) survivors, we see a rising attention to the&#xD;
      late adverse effects following treatment of RC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Late adverse effects that are highly prevalent and negatively impact patients' symptom burden&#xD;
      and quality of life are: bowel-, urological and sexual dysfunctions; psychological distress;&#xD;
      fear of recurrence. The current follow-up program primarily focuses on detection of&#xD;
      recurrence, with less attention to late adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a patient-led follow-up program, the surveillance for recurrent disease is combined with&#xD;
      detection and treatment of late adverse effects and supportive survivorship care. The&#xD;
      follow-up involves a high degree of patient-involvement, aiming at meeting the individual&#xD;
      patient's needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient-led follow-up programme is based on a standardized patient-education in order to&#xD;
      enforce the patients to assess and respond sufficiently to symptoms and health problems. In&#xD;
      case of symptoms and concerns, the patients are instructed to consult a health professional&#xD;
      for adequate assistance and intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention is tested in a multicenter randomized trial, comparing the patient-led&#xD;
      follow-up to standard routine follow-up, involving prescheduled outpatient visits.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are included from colorectal surgical departments in Aarhus, Randers, Herning and&#xD;
      Aalborg. These centres cover one third of all Danish rectal cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are approached at the postoperative visit in the outpatient clinic where they are&#xD;
      presented for the pathology results, approximately 2 weeks after primary surgery. The doctor&#xD;
      provides short oral information about the study and hand out written information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following that, a research nurse makes contact with the patient by telephone a few days&#xD;
      later, in order to clarify whether the patient wants to participate or not. Participation&#xD;
      requires written informed consent and baseline information from the patient prior to&#xD;
      randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An initial estimation of sample size showed, that a total of 334 participants were needed in&#xD;
      order to obtain statistically significant results (alpha 0.05, beta 0.20, SD 13, minimally&#xD;
      important difference 4 points on the TOI-score). The assumed standard deviation (SD) used for&#xD;
      this estimation was based on studies where setting and populations differ substantially from&#xD;
      ours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, an interim analysis of the main-outcome (Trial Outcome Index - TOI) has been&#xD;
      performed in order to determine a more precise SD. In an updated sample size estimation, the&#xD;
      following preconditions are listed: 10.4 SD, 0.05 alpha-value, 0.20 beta-value, an expected&#xD;
      difference of 4 points on the TOI-scale and an expected total drop-out of 30%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, additionally 15% are added to the sample size, due to the assumption that the&#xD;
      outcome data will be non-parametric. Thus the conclusion from the updated sample size&#xD;
      estimation is that a total of 324 participants are needed in order to obtain statistically&#xD;
      significant results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drop-out is defined by: verified metachronous recurrence, metastasis or other primary cancer,&#xD;
      death, emigration from the participating regions or if a participant leaves the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most data is collected using questionnaires, administered by the patient (Patient-reported&#xD;
      outcome measures -PROM's).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are asked to complete a questionnaire at baseline (time of inclusion), and then at&#xD;
      12 and 36 months after surgery. The questionnaires consists of questions regarding symptom&#xD;
      burden and quality of life, specific symptoms, patient activation, self-efficacy, patient&#xD;
      involvement, patient information and needs in the follow-up period, and how they have been&#xD;
      met by the Health care system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data regarding recurrence of cancer and mortality is collected from the Medical charts, while&#xD;
      data regarding socioeconomic factors is derived from national registers and data on&#xD;
      comorbidity is extracted from the national clinical database for colorectal cancer surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, data on health care utilisation in the follow-up period will be collected from&#xD;
      national registers, in combination with information from patient records (limited access).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes will be analyzed using methods for repeated measurements, and survival analysis. Any&#xD;
      difference between the two allocation groups will be significance tested, and adjusted for&#xD;
      covariates, using multiple regression analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Differences in demographics between the two groups will be calculated and significance tested&#xD;
      using a chi2-test (dichotomous and categorical data) and t-test (numerical data).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality-adjusted life years will be calculated using standard health economic methods and in&#xD;
      collaboration with an expert in health economics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study timeline:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Development of the intervention was performed during the second half of 2015. Inclusion of&#xD;
      patients in the RCT was initiated in February 2016, and is expected to be complete by the&#xD;
      31st of July 2018.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With a three-year follow-up period, the final results from the study will be analyzed and&#xD;
      ready for publication by the end of 2021.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risks and ethical concerns related to the project are limited, but there are some&#xD;
      potential concerns. Removing routine follow-up could lead to a delay in detecting&#xD;
      asymptomatic local recurrences. However, patients having symptoms with the opportunity of&#xD;
      self-referral may get an earlier detection of recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Answering the questionnaire could remind participants about their disease and lead some&#xD;
      patients to unpleasant or stressful situations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients agreeing to participate should feel secure in whatever group they are randomized to&#xD;
      follow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study follows the ethical principles in the Helsinki Declaration, and is reported and&#xD;
      approved by The National Committee on Health Research Ethics as required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data is handled and stored, according to national law and only anonymised results will be&#xD;
      published. The study is reported and approved by the Danish Data Protection Agency.&#xD;
