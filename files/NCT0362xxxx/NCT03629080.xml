  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HB-101 is a bivalent recombinant vaccine against human CMV infection. This is a randomized,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, phase 2 study to assess the safety, reactogenicity, immunogenicity, and&#xD;
      efficacy of HB-101 in CMV-Seronegative patients receiving a kidney transplant from a&#xD;
      CMV-Seropositive living donor and CMV-Seropositive patients.Patients enrolled should have a&#xD;
      living donor kidney transplantation ideally planned between two to four months after the&#xD;
      first injection of study drug (HB-101 or placebo).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 2 study to assess the safety, reactogenicity,&#xD;
      immunogenicity, and efficacy of HB-101 in adult patients awaiting kidney transplantation. For&#xD;
      Groups 1 and 2, adult CMV-seronegative (-) patients awaiting kidney transplant from a&#xD;
      CMV-seropositive (+) living donor will be enrolled according to treatment intent with regard&#xD;
      to the method of CMV prevention after transplant (either preemptive or prophylactic). This&#xD;
      will be defined at study enrollment by the investigator and institutional standards. Patients&#xD;
      enrolled in Group 1 and 2 will be randomized to receive HB-101 or placebo. For Group 3, adult&#xD;
      CMV-seropositive (+) patients awaiting kidney transplant from either CMV-seropositive(+) or&#xD;
      CMV-seronegative(-) living donors will be enrolled. Group 3 will be open label where all&#xD;
      patients will receive HB-101. The post transplant management for Group 3 patients will also&#xD;
      follow either preemptive or prophylactic method per the institution standards. The intent of&#xD;
      the study is to administer three doses of the study drug (HB-101 or placebo) prior to&#xD;
      transplantation and within proximity to the time of transplantation. However, two doses of&#xD;
      study drug will be sufficient for the patients to be included in the efficacy analyses if a&#xD;
      third dose of study drug is not feasible due to transplantation timelines. Patients will not&#xD;
      receive study drug after transplantation. Patients will be recruited globally from transplant&#xD;
      centers. The total duration of the study of each patient participating in the study will be&#xD;
      approximately 15 months.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This phase 2 study will be conducted in three groups stratified by treatment intent. In Group 1, patients will be randomized to receive HB-101 (1a) or placebo (1b) and followed preemptively post-transplant. Approximately 50 patients will be randomized in Group 1. In Group 2, patients will be randomized to receive HB-101 (2a) or placebo (2b) before transplant. Post-transplant patients will receive 3-6 months of anti-viral prophylaxis following institutional standards. Approximately 100 patients will be randomized in Group 2. In Group 3, all patients will receive HB-101 (open label) vaccination(s) prior to their transplant surgery. Post-transplant CMV management will follow either preemptive or prophylactic care as defined at study enrollment by the investigator and institutional standards. Approximately 25 patients will be randomized in Group 3.</intervention_model_description>

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who meet any of the following key criteria will be excluded from the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients planning to undergo multi-organ transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients participating in another interventional clinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Any confirmed or suspected immunodeficiency disorder (based on medical history and&#xD;
             physical examination) that could interfere with the immune response or that presents a&#xD;
             risk for the patient to receive a vaccine candidate in development.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Treatment with any chronic immunosuppressive medication or other immuno modifying&#xD;
             drugs within 6 months prior to study entry. However, inhaled and topical steroids and&#xD;
             low-dose oral corticosteroids (&lt;10 milligrams a day of prednisone or equivalent) are&#xD;
             allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Prior history of CMV disease or CMV infection requiring anti-viral therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients with a rash, dermatological condition, or tattoo in the area of the injection&#xD;
             site(s) that could interfere with administration site reaction rating. (Note: The&#xD;
             injection site(s) can be the non-dominant arm [most preferred injection site],&#xD;
             dominant arm, or either thigh [least preferred injection site], as judged by the&#xD;
             investigator).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. It is anticipated that the patient will be unavailable to complete the study&#xD;
             follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients who are highly sensitized or who are likely to undergo desensitization at&#xD;
             time of transplant (e.g., donor-specific antibody titers at the local laboratory&#xD;
             &gt;2000).&#xD;
