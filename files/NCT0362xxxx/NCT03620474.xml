The Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) is a scoring system for assessing the severity of chronic liver disease and uses the subject's values for total bilirubin, serum creatinine, and the international normalized ratio (INR) for prothrombin time to predict survival. MELD is calculated according to the following formula:&#xD;
MELD = 3.78×ln[serum bilirubin (mg/dL)] + 11.2×ln[INR] + 9.57×ln[serum creatinine (mg/dL)] + 6.43</description>
