  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial will test the effects of an n-7 monounsaturated fatty acid known as&#xD;
      palmitoleic acid (POA) on a chronic inflammation marker in overweight subjects. The study&#xD;
      will enroll male and female subjects from healthy populations with high levels of the&#xD;
      inflammatory marker c-reactive protein (CRP). Investigators will then determine over time if&#xD;
      palmitoleic acid supplementation can lower circulating levels of c-reactive protein.&#xD;
      Investigators will administer palmitoleic acid at two doses in addition to a placebo and&#xD;
      conduct a double-blind parallel arm study. Circulating CRP will be the primary endpoint and&#xD;
      secondary endpoints are Interleukin 6 (IL-6), Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha, ghrelin,&#xD;
      peptide tyrosine tyrosine (peptide YY), cardio lipid markers, glucose, insulin, leptin,&#xD;
      adiponectin, and red blood cell (RBC) and serum fatty acids.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Palmitoleic acid (POA) is a monounsaturated fatty acid that has recently been shown to&#xD;
      function as a lipokine and is present in the human diet and in blood serum. While there is&#xD;
      emerging evidence that POA can positively impact beta cell proliferation, reduce lipogenesis,&#xD;
      support endothelial function, and suppress cytokine production, POA remains to be poorly&#xD;
      studied for its beneficial anti-inflammatory potential. The latest studies suggest that POA&#xD;
      could attenuate inflammation in metabolically active tissues. Therefore, the objective of&#xD;
      this study is to determine if administration of POA in 2 varying doses to overweight&#xD;
      participants with biomarkers of chronic inflammation will lower circulating c-reactive&#xD;
      protein (CRP) and cytokine levels, as well as improve metabolism by lowering levels of&#xD;
      circulating leptin and raising expression of adiponectin. The rationale for focusing on&#xD;
      overweight individuals is that they routinely have elevated c-reactive protein levels and are&#xD;
      highly prone to have chronic inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators propose a 12-week randomized, double blinded study to assess changes in select&#xD;
      inflammatory markers, ghrelin, peptide YY, cardiovascular lipids, fatty acid levels, and&#xD;
      glucose sensitivity markers in volunteers consuming either the test agent, 500 mg or 1,000 mg&#xD;
      POA per day, or an olive oil containing fatty acid (placebo). There are three arms to study&#xD;
      and 41 individuals per arm, thus, a total of 123 subjects. Approximately 30% loss of subjects&#xD;
      is expected. Administration of the POA supplements and placebo (olive oil capsules) will be&#xD;
      double blinded. The study sponsor will hold the code for the subjects and will randomize the&#xD;
      capsules. Only the study sponsor will have the code. The identity of the capsules will be&#xD;
      revealed after the completion of the study. Subjects will bring back their bottles at each of&#xD;
      the concurrent visits and the end of the study to assess compliance and to account for any&#xD;
      missed doses of POA. The rationale for selecting olive oil as a placebo is that olive oil is&#xD;
      routinely consumed by the public. Additionally, oleic acid (the active ingredient of olive&#xD;
      oil) is the most prevalent fatty acid in human circulation, and olive oil is a routine&#xD;
      placebo for fatty acid intervention studies. The olive oil will not be extra virgin olive oil&#xD;
      that has several bioactive components. POA is virtually tasteless, thus participants should&#xD;
      not be able to self-identify their regimen of either placebo or active test agent. The&#xD;
      rationale for the experimental dose follows what is commercially available in POA products,&#xD;
      which average 700 mg per day and generally range from 450 - 1000 mg per day regimens. The&#xD;
      rationale for the 12-week time frame is to ensure uptake of POA into the target cells.&#xD;
