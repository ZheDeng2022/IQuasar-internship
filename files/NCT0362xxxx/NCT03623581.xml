  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a single-arm, phase 2 trial of Geptanolimab in patients with initially&#xD;
      unresectable, recurrent or metastatic ASPS. The study aims to study the activity of&#xD;
      Geptanolimab assessed per RECIST 1.1 and iRECIST criteria, and safety profile.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients received Geptanolimab 3mg/kg via intraveneous infusion every 2 weeks until disease&#xD;
      progression, death, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent or end the the study (i.e. a&#xD;
      maximum treatment duration of one years of the last subject, termination of treatment,&#xD;
      consent withdrawal, lost to follow-up or death, whichever occurs first).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the treatment period, subjects were evaluated for safety (once every 2 weeks) and&#xD;
      efficacy (once every 6 weeks)，If clinical symptoms suggestive of PD occur, an external visit&#xD;
      should be arranged to complete the imaging evaluation and confirmation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Geptanolimab treatment was permitted to continue beyond the first RECIST-defined progressive&#xD;
      disease (PD), if clinical benefit was noted and the toxicity was acceptable. No dose&#xD;
      modification was allowed, but dose discontinuation was permitted for up to six weeks for&#xD;
      adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety was monitored until 30 days and/or 90 days (without initiation of another anticancer&#xD;
      treatment) after the last dose of the study drug, for all patients received at least one dose&#xD;
      of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the treatment, for the subjects who have not yet developed PD and have not&#xD;
      started the subsequent anti-tumor treatment, the efficacy evaluation will continue every 6&#xD;
      weeks (± 7 days) in the first 3 months, and every 12 weeks thereafter, until the end of the&#xD;
      study or withdrawal of informed consent or occurrence of PD, initiation of a new anti-tumor&#xD;
      treatment, death or lost to follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects who had received GB226 treatment at least once were required to have survival&#xD;
      follow-up visits, which were planned every 3 months (± 14 days) after the safety follow-up /&#xD;
      disease progression follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The end of the study was defined as the death, loss of visit, withdrawal of informed consent&#xD;
      and completion of the final study visit of the last subject, and the end of treatment of the&#xD;
      last subject for one year or the early end of the study, whichever occurs first.&#xD;
