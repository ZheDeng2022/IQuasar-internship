  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of the following index inhibitors or&#xD;
      inducers of CYP2C8 and/or CYP3A on the single-dose pharmacokinetics (PK) of ozanimod and its&#xD;
      major active metabolite, CC112273, in healthy adult subjects: gemfibrozil (strong inhibitor&#xD;
      of CYP2C8), rifampin (moderate inducer of CYP2C8 and strong inducer of CYP3A), and&#xD;
      itraconazole (strong inhibitor of CYP3A).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Phase 1, randomized, parallel-group, open-label study with two parts, 1 and 2.&#xD;
      Forty subjects will be enrolled in Part 1 and will be randomized into 1 of the 2 treatment&#xD;
      groups, with 20 subjects in each treatment group. Sixty subjects will be enrolled in Part 2&#xD;
      and will be randomized into 1 of the 3 treatment groups, with 20 subjects in each treatment&#xD;
      group. . Study parts and treatment groups are as follow:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment Group A (reference): A single dose of ozanimod.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment Group B (test): Gemfibrozil 600 mg twice daily (BID) on Days 1 through 17. On&#xD;
           Day 4, a single dose of ozanimod will be coadministered with the morning dose of&#xD;
           gemfibrozil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment Group C (reference): A single dose of ozanimod.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment Group D (test): Itraconazole 200 mg once daily (QD) on Days 1 through 17. On&#xD;
           Day 4, a single dose of ozanimod will be coadministered with itraconazole.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment Group E (test): Rifampin 600 mg QD on Days 1 through 21. On Day 8, a single&#xD;
           dose of ozanimod will be coadministered with rifampin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population Subjects will be healthy men and non-pregnant, non-lactating women, ages 18&#xD;
      to 55 years, inclusive, with a body weight of at least 110 pounds (50 kg); body mass index&#xD;
      (BMI) within the range of 18.0 to 30.0 kg/m2, inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study The study duration ranges from 43 days to 50 days.&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Female subjects must meet at least 1 of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Negative serum pregnancy test at Screening and Day -1 (women of child-bearing&#xD;
                  potential [WOCBP] only).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Postmenopausal (defined as 2 years after the last period and follicle-stimulating&#xD;
                  hormone [FSH] &gt; 40 IU/L).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Received surgical sterilization (eg, bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral&#xD;
                  oophorectomy, hysterectomy) at least 6 months before Screening with medical&#xD;

&#xD;
             Must agree to practice a highly effective method of contraception throughout the study&#xD;
             until completion of the 75-day Safety Follow-up. Highly effective methods of&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Combined hormonal (oestrogen and progestogen containing) contraception, which may&#xD;
                  be oral, intravaginal, or transdermal&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation,&#xD;
                  which may be oral, injectable, implantable&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Placement of an intrauterine device or intrauterine hormone-releasing system&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Bilateral tubal occlusion&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Vasectomized partner&#xD;
&#xD;

             while participating in the study and until completion of the 75-day Safety Follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
             All subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
             Periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods), withdrawal&#xD;
             (coitus interruptus), spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea method are not&#xD;
             acceptable methods of contraception. Female condom and male condom should not be used&#xD;
             together.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Male subjects must agree to refrain from donating sperm throughout the study and until&#xD;

             and other protocol requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
