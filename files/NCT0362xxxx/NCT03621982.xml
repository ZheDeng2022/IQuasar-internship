  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates ADCT-301 in patients with Selected Advanced Solid Tumors. Patients will&#xD;
      participate in a Treatment Period with 3-week cycles and a Follow-up Period every 12 weeks&#xD;
      for up to 1 year after treatment discontinuation.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b, multi-center, open-label study with a dose-escalation part and a dose&#xD;
      expansion part.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of the study participation for each patient is defined as the time from the date&#xD;
      of signed written informed consent to the completion of the follow-up period, withdrawal of&#xD;
      consent, loss to follow-up, or death, whichever occurs first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include a Screening Period (of up to 21 days), a Treatment Period (with cycles&#xD;
      of 3 weeks for a Q3W dosing regimen), and a Follow-up Period (approximately every 12 week&#xD;
      visits) for up to 1 year after treatment discontinuation&#xD;

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product, which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. A TEAE is defined as an AE that occurs or worsens in the period extending from the first dose of study drug to 30 days after the last dose of study drug in this study or start of a new anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier.</description>
