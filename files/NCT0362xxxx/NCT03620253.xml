  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive difficulties such as indecisiveness or inability to concentrate are core symptoms&#xD;
      of depression with up to 90% of untreated depressed individuals experiencing these symptoms.&#xD;
      As many as half of those who remit from a major depressive episode continue to experience&#xD;
      residual cognitive deficits, but these symptoms are frequently overlooked in clinical&#xD;
      practice. This leads to persistent cognitive deficits which can cause reduced level of&#xD;
      functioning and loss of productivity. As standard antidepressants have an inadequate impact&#xD;
      on these residual cognitive symptoms, further treatment options are required. Modafinil is a&#xD;
      wakefulness agent with evidence that it improves some domains in cognition such as memory in&#xD;
      those whose non-cognitive depressive symptoms have been treated over a short term period.&#xD;
      This medication may have favourable lasting effects on cognition, such as the ability to plan&#xD;
      and execute tasks in those who receive modafinil for a longer time period. The aim of this&#xD;
      study is to investigate whether modafinil can enhance cognition and have additional effects&#xD;
      on functioning and work productivity in a sample of participants who were treated for&#xD;
      depression but who continue to experience cognitive deficits.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a chronic mental disorder with a lifetime prevalence of&#xD;
      5-20% (Kessler et al., 2003; Woo et al., 2016). While depressed mood and loss of interest in&#xD;
      activities are core features of MDD, cognitive deficits such as indecisiveness and&#xD;
      inattention are present and interfere with work and social functioning (McIntyre et al.,&#xD;
      2013). These cognitive deficits frequently persist beyond remission from a Major Depressive&#xD;
      Episode (MDE), with up to 94% of those impaired during an episode continuing to experience&#xD;
      deficits after the episode (Bhalla et al., 2006), including deficits in attention, executive&#xD;
      functioning, and psychomotor speed (Salagre et al., 2017). These residual cognitive symptoms&#xD;
      often persist and are associated with poor functioning and loss of productivity (Lam et al.,&#xD;
      2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a systematic review examining MDD patients in remission, multiple regression analyses&#xD;
      found that MDD predicted lower performance on measures of attention, processing speed, and&#xD;
      cognitive flexibility relative to healthy controls (HCs; Hasselbalch et al., 2011). Further&#xD;
      evidence for the presence of neuropsychological deficits in remitted MDD patients comes from&#xD;
      a systematic review and meta-analysis that found the remitted MDD patient group had executive&#xD;
      function and attentional deficits, while symptomatic patients exhibited executive function,&#xD;
      attentional, and memory deficits (Roc et al., 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importantly, there are no medications with evidence to modify cognition in remitted&#xD;
      depression. This suggests that in order to assist in the recovery of cognitive and functional&#xD;
      abilities, additional novel treatment options are required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is considerable evidence that subjective and objective measures of cognition are not&#xD;
      well correlated in MDD. This has informed the investigators' choice of separate subjective&#xD;
      and objective measures for this study. In addition, cognitive disturbances affect&#xD;
      psychosocial function and quality of life across several areas, and this necessitated&#xD;
      measurement of quality of life. In this study, the investigators will use a computerized&#xD;
      version of the Central Nervous System (CNS) Vital Signs Cognitive Battery, which will provide&#xD;
      a Neurocognitive Index score (NCI). The NCI is a global measure of cognitive functioning,&#xD;
      averaging the scores from 7 tests over 5 domains: composite memory, psychomotor speed,&#xD;
      reaction time, complex attention, and cognitive flexibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pilot results from the The Canadian Biomarker Integration Network in Depression (CAN-BIND)-1&#xD;
      study, involving treatment with escitalopram, have clearly documented the nature of deficits,&#xD;
      and are in line with expectations in remitted depression. In this pilot sample of 208&#xD;
      participants, 15% of participants had global cognitive impairment despite 8 weeks of&#xD;
      antidepressant treatment and achievement of clinical remission (McInerney, personal&#xD;
      communication).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an 8-week antidepressant study, those who significantly improved in global cognitive&#xD;
      functioning (assessed using NCI) had superior functioning and work productivity relative to&#xD;
      those who did not significantly improve (Hasselbalch et al., 2011). Vortioxetine is the only&#xD;
      antidepressant with modest evidence for improving cognitive parameters during a depressive&#xD;
      episode (Rock et al., 2013). Research into the use of psychostimulants as a treatment for&#xD;
      cognitive deficits in depressed patients has led to the consideration of modafinil and&#xD;
      methylphenidate as potential novel pharmacological treatments (Minzenberg et al., 2008).&#xD;
      Modafinil is a well-tolerated wakefulness agent where only two clinical studies have&#xD;
      previously examined its role on cognition in depression; one where currently depressed&#xD;
      patients had improvements in one measure of executive function after 4 weeks of treatment as&#xD;
      an adjuvant (DeBattista et al., 2004), and the other where there were improvements in memory&#xD;
      after a single dose in depressed participants who achieved remission (Kaser et al., 2016).&#xD;
      Unlike methylphenidate, modafinil appears to impact both &quot;hot&quot; (emotion-laden) and &quot;cold&quot;&#xD;
      (independent of emotion) cognitive deficits, which are commonly seen in remitted depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediate effects of modafinil on cognition have been shown (Kaser et al., 2016) and the&#xD;
      investigators will be the first to examine the pro-cognitive effects in a remitted depressed&#xD;
      sample over 8 weeks. The dose of modafinil (200mg) used in the study, sample size, and&#xD;
      randomized control trial (RCT) study design parallels those described in the immediate effect&#xD;
      study, and this maintains continuity. However, the study does not examine whether the&#xD;
      immediate effects are maintained. More importantly, it is unclear whether the cognitive&#xD;
      improvements translate into improvement in functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The added focus on functional outcomes fits with patient-centered models of healthcare, as&#xD;
      functional outcomes are of greatest importance to most patients. Thus, the RCT study and&#xD;
      choice of outcome variables have been carefully designed with specific endpoints to delineate&#xD;
      these aspects. Cognitive flexibility, memory, and attention will be domains of importance in&#xD;
      this study, since these domains have been shown in previous literature to be improved by&#xD;
      modafinil (Minzenberg et al., 2008; DeBattista et al., 2004; Kaser et al., 2016).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives, Hypotheses, and Impact:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to delineate the cognitive effects of modafinil in&#xD;
      patients with remitted depression at baseline and 4 weeks, and monitor whether these effects&#xD;
      are maintained with continual dosage over an 8-week period. The secondary objective of this&#xD;
      study is to understand the effect of modafinil in patients with remitted depression on&#xD;
      measures of functioning at baseline, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks, and whether these effects parallel&#xD;
      the cognitive changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' overarching hypothesis is that specific aspects of cognitive functioning,&#xD;
      including the domains of memory, attention, and cognitive flexibility, will improve through&#xD;
      treatment with modafinil. The investigators hypothesize that participants with remitted&#xD;
      depression who continue to experience cognitive deficits and are taking modafinil will have&#xD;
      improvements in aspects of cognitive domains at 4 weeks, and these improvements will be&#xD;
      sustained at 8 weeks. It is also hypothesized that functional improvements will parallel the&#xD;
      improvements in cognitive domains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study ensures a closer examination of modafinil's effect on individual facets of&#xD;
      cognition in patients with remitted MDD. This enhanced understanding will enable the&#xD;
      development of new treatment plans for residual cognitive symptoms, where none currently&#xD;
      exist. Moreover, it could spur interest in new drug development programs to address an unmet&#xD;
      need of targeting cognition across disorders where depression is a central feature (e.g.&#xD;
      Bipolar Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder). Finally, the study would delineate the&#xD;
      specific endophenotypes within cognition (e.g. working memory) and functional improvement&#xD;
      (e.g. social functioning), which would lead to personalized treatment options based on the&#xD;
      endophenotype profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods In this randomized control trial, remitted MDD patients with residual cognitive&#xD;
      deficits (n=50) will have cognitive symptoms and functioning evaluated before and after an&#xD;
      8-week trial of modafinil 200mg or placebo. Participants will be recruited through the&#xD;
      ongoing CAN-BIND 1 Wellness Study; the Depression Program at St. Michael's Hospital; the&#xD;
      shared care network at St. Michael's Hospital; and referrals from residents, family doctors,&#xD;
      and other St. Michael's psychiatrists. All participants who meet inclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      asked to enrol in this study and provide written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be on a stable dose of an antidepressant for at least 6 months prior to&#xD;
      enrolment. They will be required to remain on this stable dose for the duration (8 weeks) of&#xD;
      the trial. They will be prescribed modafinil or placebo at a dose of 100 mg for the first&#xD;
      week then 200mg for 7 weeks. After week 8, participants will be informed of which group they&#xD;
      were in and if they were taking modafinil, they can choose to continue on modafinil or to&#xD;
      discontinue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo an 8-week randomized, placebo controlled treatment trial of&#xD;
      modafinil 200mg with a total of 3 study visits. Participants may require more clinical visits&#xD;
      as needed. Screening will be done to confirm study eligibility. At the screening visit all&#xD;
      participants will provide demographic data (age, gender, education, ethnicity, occupation,&#xD;
      family history of mental illness), undergo a structured diagnostic assessment&#xD;
      (Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview), complete the CNS Vital Signs cognitive&#xD;
      battery, and have the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale administered. At the baseline&#xD;
      visit, participants will initiate the study drug trial, complete clinician rated and&#xD;
      self-report scales, and complete the cognitive battery in CNS Vital Signs. Participants will&#xD;
      start with a 100 mg dose at baseline, and increase to the 200 mg dose at week 1 if the drug&#xD;
      is well tolerated. Participants will repeat all measures at week 4 and 8. Adverse events will&#xD;
      be recorded at each study visit. For participants who wish to discontinue the study drug at&#xD;
      week 8, they will first have their dose decreased to 100 mg for one week and attend an&#xD;
      additional week 9 safety visit to evaluate adverse events before full discontinuation of the&#xD;
      study drug.&#xD;
