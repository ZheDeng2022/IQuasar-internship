  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim is to study the impact on patients and health care by an adaption of the Hamilton&#xD;
      Family Health Team model of shared care between general practitioners (GPs), mental health&#xD;
      services and other primary or specialized services. The study is done at six GP centers with&#xD;
      30 GPs in three boroughs in Oslo, Norway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each GP center with shared care one clinical psychologist from a CMHC works two and a half&#xD;
      day a week and a psychiatrist 1-2 hours a week. They are available for the GPs for&#xD;
      discussions, and they give assessment and brief treatment as requested by the GPs. Other&#xD;
      primary health and social care and other specialized mental health or substance addiction&#xD;
      services are consulted according to needs of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a cluster randomized controlled study of GP patients and their health care in GP&#xD;
      centers with shared care (experimental group) compared with usual health care in other GP&#xD;
      centers (control group). In each of three boroughs one GP center is randomized to shared care&#xD;
      for 18 months while another center continues with usual health care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Register data on patients and services are extracted for 12 months (T0) before implementation&#xD;
      of shared care and for 12 months (T1) with shared care after 6 months implementation. The&#xD;
      register data on patients and health care are extracted from the GP patient records, mental&#xD;
      health and substance abuse services, and NAV (social/welfare services). The cohorts at T0 and&#xD;
      T2 include all patients 16-65 years old seen by the GPs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient-reported mental health, functional impairment due to health problems, overall quality&#xD;
      of life and satisfaction with health services are studied for a sub-sample of the register&#xD;
      cohort at both T0 and T1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A qualitative sub-study of experiences with collaboration, the shared care model,&#xD;
      implementation of the model, facilitators and barriers is done at the end of the 18 months&#xD;
      period of shared care. The informants include patients, GPs and coworkers, and managers and&#xD;
      professionals involved with shared care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study protocol was approved by the regional and national committees on medical and health&#xD;
      research, as well as by the data protection officer at health trust.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Progress and status are described in Detailed description. Data analysis starts in September&#xD;
      2018.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      There have been various forms of collaboration in Norway between community mental health&#xD;
      centres (CMHCs), GPs and primary health and social care. But with a lack of research on such&#xD;
      models, there is little knowledge on whether they contribute to better health care, outcome&#xD;
      and satisfaction, e.g. for the large group of patients with moderately severe mental and&#xD;
      comorbid health problems mostly seen by GPs. There is a great need for clearly defined&#xD;
      collaboration models and for research-based knowledge of their feasibility and impact in the&#xD;
      context of the Norwegian health services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reviews of studies on collaboration show inconsistent results, including insufficient&#xD;
      evidence to demonstrate significant benefits from shared care (Smith 2009), modest reductions&#xD;
      in primary care consultations and mental health referrals (Harkness 2009), partly improved&#xD;
      depression management (Butler 2011), and research primarily on simpler models of&#xD;
      collaboration between two professionals (Hviding et al. 2008, Craven et al 2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Family Health Teams model developed in Hamilton, Canada, is a promising model of shared&#xD;
      care (Kates 2011a, 2011b). It is built around GP practices. Each team include one or more&#xD;
      GPs, nurses, mental health counsellors, a visiting consultant psychiatrist, and some other&#xD;
      part-time staff (pharmacist, nutritionist, physiotherapist, occupational therapist). The&#xD;
      model has increased access to care for persons with mental health and addiction problems,&#xD;
      reduced waiting time, reduced referrals to outpatient mental health services, increased&#xD;
      patient satisfaction, improved patient health, improved communication and co-ordination, and&#xD;
      increased GPs' confidence and skills in treating mental health problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONTEXT&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is done in three Oslo boroughs (Alna, Grorud, Stovner) with a total population of&#xD;
      108 000. They are served by a total of 85 GPs in GP centers, by the primary health and social&#xD;
      care in the boroughs, and by a community mental health center (CMHC), child and adolescent&#xD;
      mental health services (CAMHS) and other departments of the Division Mental Health Services&#xD;
      at Akershus University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention is an adapted version of shared care with close collaboration by services&#xD;
      and professional groups, mainly localized in three GP centers. At each GP center one clinical&#xD;
      psychologist specialist from the community mental health center (CMHC) works two and a half&#xD;
      day a week, and a psychiatrist from the CMHC work at each GP center 1-2 hours a week. The&#xD;
      psychologist and the psychiatrist are available for the GPs for consultation and discussions,&#xD;
      and they give assessment and brief treatment to patients as requested by the GPs. Other&#xD;
      primary health and social care and other specialized mental health or substance addiction&#xD;
      services are involved or consulted according to needs of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The decisions on the adaption of the model were taken by the collaborating services&#xD;
      themselves in October-December 2015 after a joint visit to Hamilton by 14 persons and with&#xD;
      input from the research group. This secured that the services had ownership and commitment to&#xD;
      the model and contributed to make it feasible and useful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The shared care in the three experimental GP centers was established during the winter of&#xD;
      2016 and were operational for 18 months from the April/May 2016 to October/November 2017. The&#xD;
      implementation was supported by discussions in monthly meetings at each GP center for the&#xD;
      professionals collaborating on shared care there, and in monthly meetings at the CMHC between&#xD;
      the psychologists and psychiatrists in shared care, managers at the CMHC and the principal&#xD;
      investigator of the research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIMS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to study the impact of a Norwegian adaption of the Hamilton Family Health Team&#xD;
      model of shared care between general practitioners (GPs), mental health services and other&#xD;
      primary or specialised services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH QUESTIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. What are the characteristics of patients seen in the usual GP practices (ICPC-2 codes,&#xD;
           mental health problems, comorbidity of mental and somatic health problems)?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. How is the total usual health care for the GP patients from GPs, primary health and&#xD;
           social care, and mental health and substance addiction services?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. How is the patient-reported mental health, functioning and satisfaction with health&#xD;
           services and collaboration in among patients seen in usual GP practices?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Is shared care associated with changes in access to mental health care, referrals to&#xD;
           specialized mental health care, use of health services and distribution of patients&#xD;
           across services?&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. What is the patient course and outcome (waiting time, sick leave, mental health,&#xD;
           functioning, duration of treatment) with shared care compared to usual health care?&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Is there a more integrated care for comorbidity (concurrent mental/somatic/substance&#xD;
           addiction problems) in shared care than in usual health care?&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. How are the GP patients' experiences with shared care compared to usual health care?&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. What do health professionals in shared care experience as main advantages and&#xD;
           disadvantages of shared care?&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. What do health professionals in shared care identify as facilitating factors or barriers&#xD;
           for implementing shared care?&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      CLUSTER RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED REGISTER STUDY ON IMPACT OF SHARED CARE&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a cluster randomized controlled study of GP patients and their health care in&#xD;
      shared care (experimental group) compared with usual health care (control group). In each of&#xD;
      three boroughs one GP center is randomized to have shared care for 18 months while another GP&#xD;
      center continues with usual health care. Register data on patients and health care are&#xD;
      extracted for 12 months (T0) before the implementation of shared care and for 12 months (T1)&#xD;
      with shared care (after 6 months with implementation of the shared care model).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retrospective register data on patients and use of services for the two 12 months periods (T0&#xD;
      and T1) are extracted from the GP patient records, Akershus University Hospital (mental&#xD;
      health and substance addiction services for adults and youth), and NAV (social/welfare&#xD;
      services). Patient cohorts at T0 and T1 include all patients 16-65 years old seen by the 30&#xD;
      GPs in 12 months. Based on earlier studies each cohort was expected to be 20-25 000 patients.&#xD;
      In 2014 the 30 GPs referred 840 patients to outpatient mental health clinics and 190 to&#xD;
      inpatient mental health wards. Based on this, significant changes in referrals to outpatient&#xD;
      clinics (main primary outcome) are expected to be shown by comparing periods of 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the data analyses of the impact of shared care the experimental sites are compared with&#xD;
      control sites at T1, as well as with all sites at T0, including a difference-in-difference&#xD;
      analysis (research questions 4-6). Data analysis on usual health care at T0 will include&#xD;
      descriptive analyses and analyses to identify and compare different patient subgroups or&#xD;
      patterns of use of health care in this unique combined data set from the several services for&#xD;
      a large group of GP patients (research questions 1-2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUB-STUDY ON PATIENT-REPORTED HEALTH AND SATISFACTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient-reported mental health, functional impairment due to health problems, overall quality&#xD;
      of life and satisfaction with health services are studied for a sub-sample of the register&#xD;
      cohort at both T0 and T1. GP patient 16-65 years old are recruited during two weeks at each&#xD;
      GP center with some assistance from research staff. Included patients give written consent&#xD;
      and complete a brief questionnaire in Norwegian or English. Inclusion criteria and secondary&#xD;
      outcome measures in the questionnaire are shown in the tables. The sample is a sub-sample of&#xD;
      the register cohorts at T0 and T1. To identify a difference of 6 points on the mental health&#xD;
      measure CORE-10 between T0 and T1 with 5% two-tailed significance and 90 % power 70 patients&#xD;
      per arm is needed in a cluster randomized trial with ICC=0.03 and 12 GPs in each arm&#xD;
      (Eldridge 2012, Schultz 2010, Moher 2010). Aiming to recruit 600-750 patients (20-25 per GP)&#xD;
      will secure a more than large enough sub-sample for the main secondary outcome measure&#xD;
      (CORE-10). Data analyses of patient-reported information will answer research question 3 and&#xD;
      parts of research questions 4 and 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      QUALITATIVE SUB-STUDY ON EXPERIENCES WITH SHARED CARE&#xD;
&#xD;
      A qualitative sub-study of experiences with collaboration in general, the shared care model,&#xD;
      implementation of the model, facilitators and barriers is done at the end of the 18 months&#xD;
      period of shared care. Focus groups are conducted with the GPs in each of the GP centers&#xD;
      (experimental and control centers), and individual qualitative interviews are done with&#xD;
      approximately 15 patients with experience of shared care, nurses and other co-workers at the&#xD;
      GP centers, professionals involved with shared care in the primary health and social&#xD;
      services, managers at the CMHC and the psychologists and psychiatrist from CMHC working in&#xD;
      the shared care. This qualitative study is done in stead of a planned survey with a&#xD;
      questionnaire to health personnel, as the number of potential informants would be too small&#xD;
      for statistical analyses compared to what was expected when planning the study. Analyses of&#xD;
      the qualitative data will answer the research questions 7-9.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICAL APPROVAL&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study protocol was approved by the Regional Committee on Medical and Health Research&#xD;
      Ethics Health Region South East 08 May 2014 (reg.no. 2014/435), by the National Committee on&#xD;
      Medical and Health Research Ethics in Norway 10 November 2014 (reg.no. 2014/160) and by the&#xD;
      Data Protection Officer at Akershus University Hospital (reg.no. 13/138). The National&#xD;
      Committee on Medical and Health Research Ethics approved that the study fulfilled the&#xD;
      necessary legal criteria to extract structured register data from the services without giving&#xD;
      the patients information or asking for written consent. The approved protocol of 2014 is&#xD;
      attached to this registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROGRESS AND STATUS OF THE STUDY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data extraction of the register cohorts was done from the GP electronic patient records in&#xD;
      2015 and 2017, from the mental health services at Akershus University Hospital in 2017-2018&#xD;
      and from the NAV (social/welfare services) in 2017-2018. Data collection from the two&#xD;
      clinical cohorts at the GP centers was done in 2015 and 2017. Quality control and&#xD;
      organization of data was done 2017-2018. Data analysis starts in September 2018.&#xD;
