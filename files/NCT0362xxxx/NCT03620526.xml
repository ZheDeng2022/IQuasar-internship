      BACKGROUND There is no effective medical treatment for heart failure with preserved ejection&#xD;
      fraction (HFpEF). Increases in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) develop in patients&#xD;
      with HFpEF. Prostacyclin analogo can possible reduced PA pressure along with PWCP pressure,&#xD;
      as with exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES This study try to determine whether inhlalation of iloprost improves exercise&#xD;
      hemodynamics and cardiac reserve in HFpEF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial, subjects&#xD;
      with HFpEF underwent invasive cardiac catheterization with simultaneous expired gas analysis&#xD;
      at rest and during exercise, before and 15 min after treatment with either inhaled iloprost&#xD;
      or matching placebo.&#xD;

      Study participants and study design The ILO-HOPE trial is a prospective, randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind, single center trial conducted at the National Taiwan University Hospital&#xD;
      (NTUH). This study was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was&#xD;
      approved by the institutional review board of the National Taiwan University Hospital, and&#xD;
      all subjects provided their written informed consent prior to participation in the study.&#xD;
      Patients referred to National Taiwan University Hospital cardiac catheterization laboratory&#xD;
      for invasive hemodyanamic exercise stress testing were enrolled. HFpEF was defined according&#xD;
      to 2016 European society of cardiology heart failure guidelines and our previous studies. In&#xD;
      brief, HFpEF was determined by (1) presence of typical HF symptoms and signs (2) LV ejection&#xD;
      fraction ≥ 50 (3) elevated levels of NT-proBNP (at least &gt;125 pg/ml) (4) echocardiographic&#xD;
      structural (a left atrial volume index &gt; 34 mL/m2 or a left ventricular mass index ≥115 g/m2&#xD;
      for males and ≥95 g/m2 for females) or functional alterations (E/e'≥13 and a mean e' septal&#xD;
      and lateral wall &lt; 9 cm/s). The exclusion criteria were chronic renal failure (creatinine &gt;&#xD;
      250 μmol/L), significant hepatic disease, secondary hypertension, pericardial disease,&#xD;
      valvular heart disease (echocardiographic evidence of at least mild stenosis or at least&#xD;
      moderate regurgitation), cancer, cor pulmonale, congenital heart disease, left-to-right&#xD;
      shunt, myocardial infarction within 60 days, high-output heart failure, long-term treatment&#xD;
      with phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors, and chronic atrial fibrillation. The patients will be&#xD;
      asked to hold nitrate for 3 days before the test if they receive any oral nitrate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial protocol Investigators will perform cardiac catheterization with simultaneous expired&#xD;
      gas analysis at rest and during supine exercise at a 20-W workload for 6 min, as previously&#xD;
      described. Hemodynamic values will be recorded for the ﬁrst exercise phase (before any drug&#xD;
      administration) and after return to steady state baseline hemodynamic values, and the second&#xD;
      exercise phase (after drug administration). Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to inhalation of&#xD;
      placebo (normal saline solution) or iloprost (50 mg/kg/min) (Bayer Pharmaceuticals,&#xD;
      Scottsdale, Ari-zona) for 5 min. The iloprost/placebo inhalation will be identical in&#xD;
      appearance and prepared by the research pharmacy, ensuring double-blinding of inhalation&#xD;
      content. After finishing inhalation process for 10 min, hemodynamic measurements will be&#xD;
      repeated at rest, followed by repeat supine exercise at a 20-W workload for 6 min, identical&#xD;
      to the study's ﬁrst phase. Arterial and venous blood samples and hemodynamic and expired gas&#xD;
      data will be acquired during each stage of the protocol. Right heart catheterization will be&#xD;
      performed through a 7-F sheath via the internal jugular vein. Transducers were zeroed at&#xD;
      mid-axilla. Right atrial pressure (RAP), pulmonary artery (PA) pressure, and PCWP will be&#xD;
      measured at end-expiration using swan-Ganz catheter 2-F, high-ﬁdelity micromanometer-tipped&#xD;
      cathe-ters (Millar Instruments, Houston, Texas) advanced through the lumen of a 7-F,&#xD;
      ﬂuid-ﬁlled catheter (Arrow, Teleﬂex, Morrisville, North Carolina)(). Mean RAP and PCWP will&#xD;
      be taken at mid A wave. Arterial blood pressure (BP) will be measured continuously through a&#xD;
      5-F radial arterial cannula. Oxygen consumption (VO2) will be measured from expired gas&#xD;
      analysis (MedGraphics, St. Paul, Minnesota) taken as the average from the 60 s preceding&#xD;
      arterial and mixed venous blood sampling. Ventilatory efﬁciency will be assessed by the&#xD;
      increase in minute ventilation relative to carbon dioxide production (VE/VCO2). CO and stroke&#xD;
      volume (SV) will be determined by the direct Fick method and heart rate as previous&#xD;
      described. Investigators also will calculate pulmonary vascular resistance, PA compliance&#xD;
      (SV/PA pulse pressure), and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) using standard formulas. LV&#xD;
      systolic performance will be assessed by LV stroke work using standard formula as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments of outcomes The primary endpoint of the trial is the PCWP during exercise.&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints are changes of other hemodynamic data including alterations in resting&#xD;
      PCWP, rest and exercise changes in RAP, PA pressure, PVR, PA compliance, systemic BP, heart&#xD;
      rate, SV, stroke work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Statistical analyses will be done on an intention to treat basis.&#xD;
      Results are reported as mean ± SD, median (interquartile range) or n (%).Within-group&#xD;
      differences are assessed by the paired Student t test. Between-group differences in rest or&#xD;
      exercise hemodynamic responses were compared by an unpaired Student t test., Wilcoxon rank&#xD;
      sum test, or Fisher exact test. Linear regression will be performed to compare hemodynamic&#xD;
      responses to exercise before and after study drug inhalation, with variables log-transformed&#xD;
      as necessary for analysis. All tests were 2-sided, with p &lt; 0.05 considered signiﬁcant. We&#xD;
      used G-power (version 3.1.9.2, Heinrich-Heine-Universität Düsseldorf, Germany;&#xD;
      http://www.gpower.hhu.de/) to calculate the sample size. A sample size of 34 total patients&#xD;
      would be needed to provide 80% power (assuming a SD of 2.76 mmHg) to detect a 2 mmHg&#xD;
      difference in the primary efficacy parameter, change in exercising PCWP, with a 5% type I&#xD;
      error rate for a 2-sided test.&#xD;
