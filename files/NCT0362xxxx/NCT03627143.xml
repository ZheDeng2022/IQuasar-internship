  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute atrial fibrillation and flutter (AAFF) is characterized by rapid heart rates with onset&#xD;
      less than seven days. It's the most common type of palpitation treated in the Emergency&#xD;
      Department (ED). Some Canadian ED's will discharge 95% of AAFF patients whereas others admit&#xD;
      up to 40%. With hospital and ED crowding, discharge is the most optimal, effective and safe&#xD;
      strategy. Our aim is to improve the care and reduce the length of stay (LOS) of ED AAFF&#xD;
      patients, while decreasing unnecessary hospitalizations. First, the investigators must&#xD;
      understand the local barriers. In the previous study, the investigators conducted interviews&#xD;
      of emergency physicians, cardiologists and AAFF patients. In Project 1b, the investigators&#xD;
      created the CAEP ED AAFF Guidelines Checklist to assist physicians to manage AAFF more&#xD;
      efficiently and safely. The Guidelines are comprised of two algorithms and four sets of&#xD;
      checklists for ED assessment and management. They have been endorsed by CAEP and are&#xD;
      published in CJEM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are now planning Project 2 in which the investigators will conduct a&#xD;
      cluster [group] randomized trial at 11 Canadian EDs and enroll 1,300 patients over thirteen&#xD;
      months. The investigators are not randomizing individual patients or doctors; instead the&#xD;
      investigators are randomizing the start date of individual hospitals. Our goal is to&#xD;
      introduce the new Guidelines into these hospitals to improve the care of AAFF patients. The&#xD;
      investigators hope to improve AAFF management, leading to a significant decrease in hospital&#xD;
      admissions and ED LOS. Central to our plans will be engagement of our two patient partners.&#xD;
      Our behaviorally optimized intervention will be developed using state-of-the-art&#xD;
      implementation science approaches informed by the results of Project 1a. The investigators&#xD;
      will also undertake within-project and end-of-project knowledge translation and&#xD;
      implementation (KTI) strategies to facilitate scale up and roll out of our program to ED&#xD;
      departments in small, medium, and large hospitals across Canada (future Project 3).&#xD;
      Ultimately the investigators expect to improve ED practices and decrease AAFF admissions and&#xD;
      LOS, without increasing visits.&#xD;
