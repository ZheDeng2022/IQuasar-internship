    <measure>Change From Baseline in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) Total Score at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>DLQI is a simple, compact, and practical questionnaire to assess limitations related to the impact of skin disease. The instrument contains ten items dealing with the participant's skin. The participant responds on a four-point scale, ranging from &quot;Very Much&quot; (score 3) to &quot;Not at All&quot; or &quot;Not relevant&quot; (score 0). The DLQI total score is derived by summing all item scores, which has a possible range of 0 to 30, with 30 corresponding to the worst quality of life, and 0 corresponding to the best. A lower score (that is, negative change score) indicates improvement in the Quality of Life.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS)-Related Pain Symptom Score in the Past 24 Hours Based on Hidradenitis Suppurativa Symptom Diary (HSSD) Questionnaire at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>HSSD is a 7-item patient self-reported questionnaire that assesses 5 HS-related symptoms including pain, tenderness, hot skin feeling, odor, and itchiness. The participants were asked to rate the severity of each symptom on a 0 to 10 numerical rating scale, with 0 indicating no symptom experience and 10 indicating the worst possible symptom experience. All 5 symptoms have a recall period of the past 7 days, except for 2 additional questions on pain which evaluate current pain and pain in the past 24 hours with a score range from 0 (no symptom experience) to 10 (worst possible symptom experience). A total symptom score also ranged from 0 (no symptom) to 10 (worst possible symptom), was derived by averaging the 5 individual scale scores that utilize the past 7-day recall period. Change from baseline in HS-related pain symptom score based on HSSD was reported.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) Total Score at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The HADS has been developed to identify symptoms of anxiety and depression in hospitalized participants and in outpatients. It comprises 14 items, seven to assess anxiety (HADS-A), namely items 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 13; and seven to assess depression (HADS-D), namely items 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14. Each item receives a score from 0 to 3 on a Likert Scale. The total score for each HADS-A and HADS-D scale is obtained by adding the individual scores for each item, with the maximum score 21. The presence or absence of depression and anxiety was defined, for each respective scale, based on the following cutoff values: HADS (anxiety): 0-8 equal to (=) no anxiety; greater than (&gt;) 9 = anxiety; HADS (depression): 0-8 = no depression; &gt;9 = depression.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) Total Score at Week 16</title>
        <description>DLQI is a simple, compact, and practical questionnaire to assess limitations related to the impact of skin disease. The instrument contains ten items dealing with the participant's skin. The participant responds on a four-point scale, ranging from &quot;Very Much&quot; (score 3) to &quot;Not at All&quot; or &quot;Not relevant&quot; (score 0). The DLQI total score is derived by summing all item scores, which has a possible range of 0 to 30, with 30 corresponding to the worst quality of life, and 0 corresponding to the best. A lower score (that is, negative change score) indicates improvement in the Quality of Life.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS)-Related Pain Symptom Score in the Past 24 Hours Based on Hidradenitis Suppurativa Symptom Diary (HSSD) Questionnaire at Week 16</title>
        <description>HSSD is a 7-item patient self-reported questionnaire that assesses 5 HS-related symptoms including pain, tenderness, hot skin feeling, odor, and itchiness. The participants were asked to rate the severity of each symptom on a 0 to 10 numerical rating scale, with 0 indicating no symptom experience and 10 indicating the worst possible symptom experience. All 5 symptoms have a recall period of the past 7 days, except for 2 additional questions on pain which evaluate current pain and pain in the past 24 hours with a score range from 0 (no symptom experience) to 10 (worst possible symptom experience). A total symptom score also ranged from 0 (no symptom) to 10 (worst possible symptom), was derived by averaging the 5 individual scale scores that utilize the past 7-day recall period. Change from baseline in HS-related pain symptom score based on HSSD was reported.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline and Week 16</time_frame>
        <population>FAS included all randomized participants who received at least one administration of study intervention.

          <title>Change From Baseline in Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS)-Related Pain Symptom Score in the Past 24 Hours Based on Hidradenitis Suppurativa Symptom Diary (HSSD) Questionnaire at Week 16</title>
          <description>HSSD is a 7-item patient self-reported questionnaire that assesses 5 HS-related symptoms including pain, tenderness, hot skin feeling, odor, and itchiness. The participants were asked to rate the severity of each symptom on a 0 to 10 numerical rating scale, with 0 indicating no symptom experience and 10 indicating the worst possible symptom experience. All 5 symptoms have a recall period of the past 7 days, except for 2 additional questions on pain which evaluate current pain and pain in the past 24 hours with a score range from 0 (no symptom experience) to 10 (worst possible symptom experience). A total symptom score also ranged from 0 (no symptom) to 10 (worst possible symptom), was derived by averaging the 5 individual scale scores that utilize the past 7-day recall period. Change from baseline in HS-related pain symptom score based on HSSD was reported.</description>

        <description>HSSD is a 7-item patient self-reported questionnaire that assesses 5 HS-related symptoms including pain, tenderness, hot skin feeling, odor, and itchiness. The participants were asked to rate the severity of each symptom on a 0 to 10 numerical rating scale, with 0 indicating no symptom experience and 10 indicating the worst possible symptom experience. All 5 symptoms have a recall period of the past 7 days, except for 2 additional questions on pain which evaluate current pain and pain in the past 24 hours. A total symptom score, also ranged from 0 (no symptom) to 10 (worst possible symptom), was derived by averaging the 5 individual scale scores that utilize the past 7-day recall period.</description>

        <description>The HS-IGA documents the investigator's assessment of the participant's HS at a given timepoint. The anatomic region with the most severe HS activity at the baseline was evaluated for erythema, drainage, and pain and/or tenderness to palpation for each participant. The participant's HS is assessed as inactive (0), almost inactive (1), mild activity (2), moderate activity (3), or severe activity (4). A higher score indicates more severe disease.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) Total Score at Week 16</title>
        <description>The HADS has been developed to identify symptoms of anxiety and depression in hospitalized participants and in outpatients. It comprises 14 items, seven to assess anxiety (HADS-A), namely items 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 13; and seven to assess depression (HADS-D), namely items 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14. Each item receives a score from 0 to 3 on a Likert Scale. The total score for each HADS-A and HADS-D scale is obtained by adding the individual scores for each item, with the maximum score 21. The presence or absence of depression and anxiety was defined, for each respective scale, based on the following cutoff values: HADS (anxiety): 0-8 equal to (=) no anxiety; greater than (&gt;) 9 = anxiety; HADS (depression): 0-8 = no depression; &gt;9 = depression.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) of Hidradenitis Suppurativa Severity Scale Score at Week 16</title>
          <description>The PGIC of HS Severity is a questionnaire that measures participants' perceived change (improvement or deterioration) in severity of their HS. Participants rated how his/her HS has changed since the beginning of the study using a 7-point scale ranging from 1 which indicates &quot;a lot better now&quot; to 7 which indicates &quot;a lot worse now&quot; with a neutral center point 4 which indicates (&quot;neither better nor worse&quot;). Participants' PGIC of HS Severity scale score at Week 16 were reported</description>
          <population>FAS included all randomized participants who received at least one administration of study intervention. Participants with missing data after applying treatment failure rules are assumed to be 'Not improved'. Here, N (number of participants analyzed) signifies participants who were evaluated for this outcome measure.</population>
