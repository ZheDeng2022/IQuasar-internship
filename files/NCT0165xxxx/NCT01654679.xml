  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to dermine whether local-water filtered infrared-A (wIRA)&#xD;
      irradiation can reduce postoperative wound infection. wIRA irradiation is applied 20min&#xD;
      directly preoperatively, before patients underwent abdominal surgery. The wIRA is a harmless&#xD;
      light source, that has been described before. We test the impact and clinical outcome of&#xD;
      patients undergoing a one-time preoperative wIRA irradiation on postoperative wound healing.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Wound healing is a complex pathophysiological process that is related to pain, discomfort and&#xD;
      immobility of patients and when not well controlled may lead to devastating and morbidity&#xD;
      related wound infections. Furthermore, prolonged hospital stay, increased pain and&#xD;
      consecutive increased drug consumption is often associated with postoperative wound&#xD;
      infections. Although the average costs of wound infections are difficult to assess, there is&#xD;
      no doubt that a prophylactic tool in controlling postoperative wound healing would have&#xD;
      tremendous potential. Recent studies indicate that the application of different forms of&#xD;
      thermal energy to the skin surface decreases postoperative wound infections significantly. It&#xD;
      is known that high-normal arterial oxygen tension levels have decreased surgical wound&#xD;
      infection from 11% to 5%. The application of water-filtered infrared A (wIRA) irradiation has&#xD;
      been successfully applied in patients with ulcus cruris and superficial skin-tumors to&#xD;
      alleviate pain and regulation of the body temperature in neonatology. The simple preoperative&#xD;
      whole body warming for 30 min before surgery resulted in a statistically reduced occurrence&#xD;
      of postoperative wound infections. A more recent study showed the beneficial effects of&#xD;
      postoperative wIRA application on wound healing. The effects of wIRA leading to this success&#xD;
      in therapy can be explained by thermal and non-thermal effects. A major advantage of the wIRA&#xD;
      vs. the application of simple warming blankets lies upon the effective penetration of the&#xD;
      wIRA applied energy within the deep subcutaneous tissue at depths of 2-3 cm. Further effects&#xD;
      of the applied energy lead to vasodilation of capillaries with consecutive effective&#xD;
      conduction of energetic blood flow into deeper tissue layers. Non-thermal effects of the wIRA&#xD;
      application consist of direct stimulation and active immunomodulation by specialized immune&#xD;
      cells. Furthermore, wIRA can induce protective proteins, e.g. ferritin in the skin and&#xD;
      potentially influences common cross-talks within cells and extracellular matrices. These&#xD;
      effects display regulatory roles in wound repair processes that may also be responsible for&#xD;
      positive cosmetic results. More important for the clinical assessment of wound healing in the&#xD;
      early phase of hospitalization is the effect of wIRA to significantly reduce postoperative&#xD;
      pain. Surgery and postoperative pain evoke stress related effects that are induced by&#xD;
      profound neuroendocrine changes in cytokine activity and related processes. Increased blood&#xD;
      flow, due to vasodilation, helps to strongly eliminate accumulated pain mediators, lactic&#xD;
      acid and potential bacterial toxins. The metabolism is induced and mediates also non-thermal&#xD;
      effects such as attraction of immune cells and potential effects on nociceptors. These direct&#xD;
      effects of wIRA can be easily followed when postoperative irradiation is performed. The&#xD;
      problem of developing wound infections may rely within the first hours after and already&#xD;
      during the operation, when the wound gets &quot;preconditioned&quot; with potential mediators or&#xD;
      bacteria that may lead to postoperative encountered wound infections. A recent study&#xD;
      indicated that immediate postoperative warming for 2 hours after hernia surgery may provide&#xD;
      comparable benefits to seven days of warming. According to the idea of preventing deleterious&#xD;
      preconditions in the process of wound healing, we tested here, the one time preoperative&#xD;
      application of wIRA and its impact on postoperative wound healing and related clinical&#xD;
      questions. Comparable to preoperative antibiotic single shot treatment we relied on the&#xD;
      expansive impact of preoperative wIRA application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prospective randomized controlled clinical trial is designed to study the effects of&#xD;
      single time preoperative wIRA irradiation on the postoperative outcome of wound infections&#xD;
      after visceral surgery.&#xD;
