      This study aim to compare cosmetic results between 3 trichophytic closure techniques for&#xD;
      donor site (the trimming of upper, lower and both edge of linear incision) in hair&#xD;
      transplantation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Strip harvesting technique, a conventional hair transplantation procedure, is widely used in&#xD;
      the treatment of androgenetic alopecia for more than half a century. It provides less&#xD;
      time-consuming, more feasible and more cost-effective comparing with follicular unit&#xD;
      extraction (FUE) technique. However, linear scar at the donor site is also introduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The latest method to fine the scar at the donor site was invented and known as 'Trichophytic&#xD;
      closure technique'. It can be done by trimming upper or lower wound edge for about 1&#xD;
      millimeter (as Fig.1) before wound closure. Then the linear scar will be less visible after&#xD;
      hair growth. Anyway, there is no exactly wound edge (upper, lower or both) that recommended&#xD;
      for the excellent cosmetic results without any severe side effects. Therefore, this study was&#xD;
      designed to determine which is the best trichophytic closure technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research is a pilot, split-wound comparison study of trichophytic closure techniques for&#xD;
      donor site in hair transplantation.10 males, aged â‰¥ 25 years, who require strip harvesting&#xD;
      follicular unit transplantation in the treatment of androgenetic alopecia will be enrolled.&#xD;
      Preoperative and perioperative process will be conducted as standard procedure except wound&#xD;
      closure technique. Each incision wound of donor site will be equally divided into 3 parts&#xD;
      (marked with tattoos as Fig.2) and each part will be randomly treated with different&#xD;
      trichophytic closure techniques as below.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The 1-millimetre trimming of upper edge of linear incision before wound closure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The 1-millimetre trimming of lower edge of linear incision before wound closure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The 0.5-millimetre trimming of both edge of linear incision before wound closure For&#xD;
           evaluation, we have planned to assess both cosmetic results and side effects as shown in&#xD;
           the table. ( Table 1 - image file ) After data collecting process, we have planned to&#xD;
           analyze the demographic data, rate of infection and other side effects in a descriptive&#xD;
           manner. However, the evaluation for cosmetic results will be analyzed by paired t-test&#xD;
           in the same technique at different follow up period and by one-way ANOVA between each&#xD;
           technique at the same follow up period.&#xD;
