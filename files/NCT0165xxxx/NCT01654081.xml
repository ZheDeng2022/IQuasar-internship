    <textblock>
      The goal of this trial is to demonstrate the potential clinical benefit of irinotecan&#xD;
      chemotherapy in patients with a specific NSCLC phenotype, ISG15-positive. The use of&#xD;
      irinotecan in subjects with ISG15-positive NSCLC will be associated with an improved rate of&#xD;
      clinical benefit (objective response, disease stability, and time to progression) compared to&#xD;
      historical controls that were not previously selected for ISG-15 expression.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be 18 years of age or greater with histologically or cytologically&#xD;
             confirmed non-small cell lung cancer that is advanced and cannot be treated adequately&#xD;
             by radiotherapy or surgery; or metastatic or recurrent disease after at least one&#xD;
             prior chemotherapy regimen&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior invasive malignancies are allowed, provided at least five years has elapsed&#xD;
             since the completion of therapy and enrollment on this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All participants must have received at least one prior chemotherapy regimen for&#xD;
             metastatic NSCLC; prior adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy for NSCLC will also be&#xD;
             allowed, but will NOT be counted toward the number of regimens for metastatic disease&#xD;
             unless patients develop evidence of metastatic disease within six months of the&#xD;
             initiation of the adjuvant chemotherapy, indicating resistance to platinum-based&#xD;
             therapy. There is no limit on the number of prior regimens allowed, provided the&#xD;
             patient meets all other eligibility criteria. Patients who may best benefit from the&#xD;
             application of specific targeted therapies (i.e., erlotinib for EGFR exon 19 or 21&#xD;
             activating mutations, or crizotinib for EML4-ALK translocations) will be eligible for&#xD;
             this protocol only after documented progression through such targeted therapy AND a&#xD;
             platinum-based doublet regimen&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All participants must have the appropriate phenotype on pretreatment screening of&#xD;
             tumor tissue or sputa, consisting of ISG15-positive cells by immunohistochemistry&#xD;
             (staining score of 4-12, as defined in section 4.2), performed by the UK Department of&#xD;
             Pathology, and must agree to have their tissues evaluated for ISG15 expression (a&#xD;
             separate informed consent will be requested). Potential participants who have no&#xD;
             available tissue for assessment will be offered sputum assessment or tissue biopsy if&#xD;
             it can be performed safely, potential disease sites can be safely approached, and only&#xD;
             if it is the opinion or their attending physician that participation in this protocol&#xD;
             represents their best treatment option at this time. Subjects with assessable material&#xD;
             will not be required to undergo a separate biopsy solely for participation in this&#xD;
             protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have the following baseline laboratory values (bone marrow, renal,&#xD;
             hepatic):&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate bone marrow function:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt;1000/μL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Platelet count &gt;100'000/μL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum creatinine &lt; 2.0 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bilirubin &lt;1.5x normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum calcium &lt; 12 mg/dl&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Signed Informed Consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG Performance Status &lt;2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy &gt; 16 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be&#xD;
             accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded for&#xD;
             non-nodal lesions and short axis for nodal lesions) as &gt;20 mm with conventional&#xD;
             techniques or as &gt;10 mm with spiral CT scan, MRI, or calipers by clinical exam. See&#xD;
             Section 11 for the evaluation of measurable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients of childbearing potential must be using an effective means of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The effects of Irinotecan on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and&#xD;
        because camptothecins are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men&#xD;
        must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control;&#xD;
        abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a&#xD;
        woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating&#xD;
        in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or&#xD;
        enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study,&#xD;
        for the duration of study participation, and 4 months after completion of irinotecan&#xD;
        administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior therapy with irinotecan, topotecan, or other camptothecin analog&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients whose tumor harbors an EGFR exon 19 or 21 mutation who has not yet received&#xD;
             prior therapy with an EGFR-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor such as erlotinib or&#xD;
             gefitinib&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients whose tumor harbors an EML4/ALK translocation and who has not yet received&#xD;
             crizotinib&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or lactating females&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Myocardial infarction or ischemia, or active cerebrovascular disease, within the 6&#xD;
             months before Cycle 1' Day 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled clinically significant dysrhythmia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior radiotherapy to an indicator lesion unless there is objective evidence of tumor&#xD;
             growth in that lesion&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled metastatic disease of the central nervous system (previously treated,&#xD;
             stable disease is allowable on this protocol)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Radiotherapy within the 2 weeks before registration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Surgery within the 2 weeks before registration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any co morbid condition that' in the view of the attending physician' renders the&#xD;
             patient at high risk from treatment complications&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or&#xD;
             mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered from adverse&#xD;
             events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known untreated brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical&#xD;
             trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive&#xD;
             neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other&#xD;
             adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because Irinotecan is a camptothecin with&#xD;
             the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown&#xD;
             but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with Irinotecan, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated&#xD;
             with Irinotecan.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of&#xD;
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with Irinotecan. In addition, these&#xD;
             patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with&#xD;
             marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients&#xD;
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.&#xD;
