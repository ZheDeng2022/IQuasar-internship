    <textblock>
      Aortic stenosis (AS), or narrowing of the aortic valve, is the commonest condition requiring&#xD;
      valve surgery in the developed world. It is currently not known what determines who will go&#xD;
      on to develop symptoms. Exercise testing may be able to identify these patients better than&#xD;
      the severity of the narrowing itself, but with some limitations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to compare whether MRI scanning or exercise testing can better&#xD;
      identify patients with AS who are likely to benefit from surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: The investigators will measure blood flow to the heart muscle with MRI scanning and&#xD;
      perform exercise testing in 170 patients with AS and follow them for up to up to 2 years.&#xD;
      Expected outcomes: MRI scanning will more accurately identify those patients with AS who will&#xD;
      need surgery during this period. Anticipated Health Benefits: improved selection of patients&#xD;
      with AS who are likely to benefit from early surgery. This is likely to reduce deaths in such&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

      Surgical AVR remains the universally accepted management for symptomatic aortic stenosis&#xD;
      (AS). However, the best management of severe aortic stenosis, in the absence of symptoms,&#xD;
      remains one of the most controversial areas in modern Cardiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise testing can identify asymptomatic patients with AS at increased risk, but with&#xD;
      limited specificity. In a BHF funded project, the investigators have identified that cardiac&#xD;
      MRI measured Myocardial Perfusion Reserve (MPR) may be a novel imaging biomarker in AS. MPR&#xD;
      was the only independent predictor of aerobic exercise capacity (peak VO2) in patients with&#xD;
      severe AS and was also inversely related to symptomatic status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this multi-centre, observational, cohort outcome study, the investigators will follow 175&#xD;
      patients with asymptomatic moderate to severe AS for a minimum of 12 months, and determine&#xD;
      whether MPR is a better predictor of outcome than exercise testing, elucidate the mechanisms&#xD;
      contributing to symptom development in AS and establish the determinants of MPR in AS.&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited from tertiary Cardiac centres, as well as regional hospitals.&#xD;
      Comprehensive CMR with adenosine stress to determine LV mass and function, focal and diffuse&#xD;
      fibrosis and MPR; cardiopulmonary exercise testing (peak VO2 and exercise symptoms); rest and&#xD;
      exercise echocardiography (AS severity, valve compliance) and NT-proBNP will be performed.&#xD;
      The study will be run in conjunction with the Glasgow CTU. Investigations will be analysed&#xD;
      blind to patient status and data will be entered in a validated database. Statistical&#xD;
      analysis will be performed under the supervision of Prof. Ian Ford. The relationship between&#xD;
      MPR and exercise testing with 1-year outcome will be analysed using logistic regression.&#xD;
      Paired comparisons of the specificities of the two approaches on the same dataset will be&#xD;
      carried out using McNemar's test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypothesis is that MPR will be a better predictor of adverse outcome than&#xD;
      exercise testing.&#xD;
