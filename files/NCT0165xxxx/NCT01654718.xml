      This study was to compare the single-dose oral bioequivalence of Pantoprazole sodium 40 mg&#xD;
      delayed release tablets (containing 45.1 mg of Pantoprazole sodium sesquihydrate is&#xD;
      equivalent to 40 mg of Pantoprazole) of OHM Laboratories Inc. USA (a subsidiary of Ranbaxy&#xD;
      Pharmaceuticals Inc. USA) with PROTONIX® 40 mg delayed release tablets (containing 45.1 mg of&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was an open-label, balanced, randomized, two-treatment, two-period, two-sequence,&#xD;
      single-dose, crossover, bioequivalence under fed conditions&#xD;
&#xD;
      A washout period of 08 days was enforced between the administrations of study drugs in each&#xD;
      period. At study check-in, the subjects reported to the clinical site at least 36 hours prior&#xD;
      to Day 1 dosing and were required to stay for 24 hours after Day 1 dosing. Blood sample&#xD;
      collections were obtained within 90 minutes prior to dosing (0 hour) and after dose&#xD;
      administration at periodic interval up to 48.00 hour in each period. A total number of blood&#xD;
      draws during the study were sixty six (66) and the total volume of blood drawn did not exceed&#xD;
      324 mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following an overnight fast of at least 10 hour, a high-fat high-calorie breakfast was served&#xD;
      to the study subjects. Thirty minutes after start of this breakfast, a single oral dose of&#xD;
      Pantoprazole delayed release tablet 40 mg of either test or reference formulation was&#xD;
      administered during each period of the study, along with 240 mL of drinking water at ambient&#xD;
      temperature under low light condition and under supervision of trained study personnel. Both&#xD;
      test and reference products were administered to all the study subjects, one in each period.&#xD;
