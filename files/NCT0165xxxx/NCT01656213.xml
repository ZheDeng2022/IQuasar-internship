      TITLE Randomised Control Trial (RCT) for improving functional outcome from stroke in renal&#xD;
      disease patients DESIGN Eandomised Conrol Study AIMS&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Undertake detailed characterisation of stroke (including recently developed imaging&#xD;
           techniques at Imperial) of stroke in renal disease patients including clinical, imaging&#xD;
           and epidemiological data&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To Investigate if passive intervention using hand grip device during dialysis sessions&#xD;
           will improve functional outcome from stroke in end stage renal disease patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME MEASURES&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Primary outcome:. 3 months change in Upper-Extremity Fugl-Meyer scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary outcome: 3 months change in NIHS &amp; Bartel scores&#xD;
&#xD;
      POPULATION Ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke patients with renal disease treated at&#xD;
      Hammersmith's Hospital's renal Unit. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELIGIBILITY Data of all patients with renal disease and imaging proven stroke will be&#xD;
      retrospectively analysed. RCT will be conducted on End Stage Renal Disease patients with&#xD;
      acute (&lt;7 days) stroke affecting arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DURATION 2 years&#xD;

      Randomised Control Trial. ESRD patients on dialysis who have suffered an acute (&lt;7 days)&#xD;
      stroke (ischaemic/haemorrhagic) and predicted to have the worst likely outcome (see above)&#xD;
      will be recruited for this RCT. Stroke patients will be randomly assigned to the intervention&#xD;
      (60 patients) or standard treatment (60 patients) arms (power calculation below). Patients&#xD;
      will have detailed demographic information documented. In addition, type, frequency and&#xD;
      length of time on dialysis will be noted. Pre-/post- Upper-Extremity Fugl-Meyer scores will&#xD;
      be undertaken (sensitive measure of arm motor function).&#xD;
&#xD;
      60 patients will be randomly allocated to the visual-feedback handgrip (affected arm)&#xD;
      exercise that we have developed in-house (using Current Designs hand-grip force transducer,&#xD;
      and E-Prime software). Subjects allocated to treatment will be trained in the laptop-based&#xD;
      exercise that takes 20 minutes/session. Subjects will be encouraged to perform the exercise&#xD;
      2-3 times per dialysis session depending upon mood, although will be permitted to skip&#xD;
      sessions if they do not feel well or motivated. The laptop program time-stamps each session,&#xD;
      and records a time-series of duration, force and accuracy of hand grip.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-intervention. 60 similar ESRD stroke patients will be randomly assigned to the&#xD;
      non-intervention arm. These patients will receive standard advice during dialysis (rest or&#xD;
      gentle activity, e.g. reading).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note that both groups of patients will also receive standard multidisciplinary rehabilitation&#xD;
      care following a stroke, including therapy sessions at times other than receiving dialysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1 STUDY OUTCOME MEASURES Primary outcome. 3 months change in Upper-Extremity Fugl-Meyer&#xD;
      scores. Secondary outcome: 3 months changes in NIHS &amp; Bartel scores&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PARTICIPANT ENTRY&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.1 PRE-REGISTRATION EVALUATIONS We will recruit patients, who suffered from imaging proven,&#xD;
      acute stroke affecting arm, while undergoing maintenance haemodialysis at the Imperial&#xD;
      College NHS Trust as well as retrospectively analyse data of all patients with renal disease&#xD;
      and stroke treated at Hammersmith Hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.2 INCLUSION CRITERIA Patients with imaging proven, acute (&lt;7days) stroke affecting arm, on&#xD;
      maintenance dialysis will be recruited into the RCT. Patients have to be able to consent for&#xD;
      the study either in writing, verbally or nonverbally in presence of a witness. We will&#xD;
      retrospectively analyse the database of all renal disease patients with stroke. This data was&#xD;
      collected by Hammersmith Hospital's Renal Team. In case of non-English speaking patients we&#xD;
      will use Hospital's interpreter's services to explain the study to the patient, obtain their&#xD;
      consent and train them in using the device. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.3 EXCLUSION CRITERIA Patients unwilling to give consent, patients unable to use hand grip&#xD;
      tool due to severe hand weakness (MRC 0/5), patients unable to understand English or their&#xD;
      native language due to receptive aphasia, dementia. Patients with arteriovenous fistula in&#xD;
      the affected arm will be excluded from the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.4 WITHDRAWAL CRITERIA Patients unwilling to further participate in the study. Patients, who&#xD;
      lose capacity to consent during the study. Patient experiencing side effects. In these cases&#xD;
      the data collected will be used for final analysis but no new data will be collected.&#xD;
