    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test an investigational vaccine known as &quot;VAX161C.&quot; An&#xD;
      &quot;investigational&quot; vaccine is one that is not licensed for commercial use in the by the United&#xD;
      States (US) by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). VAX161C is a vaccine for the&#xD;
      influenza A virus subtype H5N1 avian influenza virus (bird flu). In this study, the subject&#xD;
      will receive the VAX161C vaccine at one of six doses to see which dose is the best. VaxInnate&#xD;
      wants to find out how safe these doses of vaccines are and how well they are tolerated by&#xD;
      people who receive them. To measure how effective each type of the vaccine is, VaxInnate will&#xD;
      test the ability of the body to develop an immune response, which means how the body&#xD;
      recognizes and defends itself against the influenza virus.&#xD;

      SAFETY ASSESSMENTS AND REPORTING Immediate Complaints Immediate complaints are vaccination&#xD;
      symptoms that are solicited and observed for two hours (+30 minutes) after vaccination on Day&#xD;
      0 and vaccination on Day 21. Solicited immediate complaints will be grouped as local&#xD;
      (injection site) complaints and general complaints (Appendix A: Solicited Local and General&#xD;
      Vaccination Reactogenicity Symptoms). Solicited local (injection site) complaints include&#xD;
      redness (erythema), swelling or induration, pain, bruising and solicited general complaints&#xD;
      will include fever, headache, fatigue, joint pain, muscle aches, shivering (chills), and&#xD;
      increased sweating. Each of these local and general complaints will be graded for severity&#xD;
      using the guidelines provided in Appendix B: Local Reactogenicity Toxicity Grading Scale and&#xD;
      Appendix C: General Reactogenicity Toxicity Grading Scale. The data will be reported as&#xD;
      &quot;immediate complaints&quot; and presumed to be related to the investigational product. These&#xD;
      findings should NOT be additionally recorded as AEs unless they meet the criteria set forth&#xD;
      in Section 8.3. Any other symptom offered by study subjects at 2 hours (+30 minutes) after&#xD;
      each vaccination will be recorded under the AE section of the CRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vaccine Reactogenicity The same sets of local and general complaints, complaints reasonably&#xD;
      anticipated to occur as a result of receipt of the investigational product are included in&#xD;
      the Reactogenicity Memory Aid and listed in Appendix A: Solicited Local and General&#xD;
      Vaccination Reactogenicity Symptoms. These will be solicited by study staff in conjunction&#xD;
      with review of the Memory Aid during the 7 days following vaccinations on Day 0 and 21. The&#xD;
      severity will be graded using the grading scales provided in Appendix B: Local Reactogenicity&#xD;
      Toxicity Grading Scale and Appendix C: General Reactogenicity Toxicity Grading Scale and all&#xD;
      findings recorded in the CRFs. Symptoms from the Reactogenicity Memory Aid will be reported&#xD;
      as &quot;reactogenicity&quot; and presumed to be related to the investigational product. These&#xD;
      complaints should NOT be additionally recorded as AEs unless they meet the criteria set forth&#xD;
      in Section 8.3. Definitions used to grade reactogenicity severity will be included on the&#xD;
      Reactogenicity Memory Aid form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Oversight VaxInnate VaxInnate is the study Sponsor. Sponsor responsibilities will&#xD;
      include the creation and oversight of protocol development, submission of the Investigational&#xD;
      New Drug (IND) application to the FDA, monitoring and ensuring Good Clinical Practice (GCP)&#xD;
      conduct of the study, and the submission of annual and final study reports to the FDA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) The SMC will consist of 3 independent medical monitors not&#xD;
      associated with study. The Principal Investigator(s), VaxInnate Medical Monitor, and the Data&#xD;
      Manager will provide information to the SMC. The SMC will assess the safety information after&#xD;
      each part of the study to determine if it is safe to escalate to the next dose level. The SMC&#xD;
      meetings will be convened after the safety data for both doses has been collected for&#xD;
      subjects enrolled in part 1 and later for part 2. The SMC will review the safety data and&#xD;
      make a recommendation on continuing on to the next part of the study. The safety data and the&#xD;
      SMC's recommendations will be forwarded to CBER for their review and agreement. The SMC will&#xD;
      also meet on an ad hoc basis to review adverse events or other safety related issues. If a&#xD;
      safety issue occurs that would halt the study (Section 4.5), the IRB and FDA will be&#xD;
      notified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANALYTICAL AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN Data Entry and Management Subject&#xD;
      screening/enrollment will be documented using an electronic master subject log. This log will&#xD;
      capture the following information: subject number; initials; date screen/enroll; and, reason&#xD;
      for not enrolling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study and in VAX161B, CRFs utilizing Smart Pen TM, a digital pen technology, will be&#xD;
      used to gather originally-captured data. Therefore, the CRFs will serve as the source&#xD;
      documentation for all protocol procedures and assessments, except for concomitant&#xD;
      medications, adverse events, and all &quot;Symptom Assessments&quot; obtained from subject-completed&#xD;
      memory aids (MEMA CRF). For these required procedures and assessments, the collected data&#xD;
      will be recorded onto logs or memory aids as source documentation. This data will then be&#xD;
      transcribed onto the CRF by the study staff. Health Decisions' electronic data management&#xD;
      system will be used to create, modify, maintain, archive, retrieve, and transmit study data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigator remains responsible for the accuracy and adequacy of all data entered onto&#xD;
      the CRFs. Data will be monitored as described in section 10.1. Under direction of the&#xD;
      clinical monitor, CRFs will be source document verified, as appropriate and further&#xD;
      processed. Upon further data processing, queries may be generated and sent to the&#xD;
      Investigator for clarification or correction. The Investigator will address any queries and&#xD;
      resolutions verified by the clinical monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The database will be &quot;soft-locked&quot; for analysis when all subjects' data have been entered and&#xD;
      data queries have been resolved through Day 42 (± 2) and after immunogenicity samples have&#xD;
      been tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis Additional details of the analysis will be provided in the Statistical Analysis&#xD;
      Plan (SAP) and the Clinical Study Report (CSR). This plan will include details of handling&#xD;
      missing data, and if applicable, unused and spurious data. Deviations from the SAP will be&#xD;
      reported in the CSR. The SAP will be finalized before study completion. If there are any&#xD;
      discrepancies between the protocol and the SAP, the SAP will take precedence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size and Power For the purpose of assessing the safety and immunogenicity of VAX161C&#xD;
      vaccine a total of 250 subjects are divided into 6 dose groups in a ratio of 1:2:2:2:2:1.&#xD;
      Groups of 50 subjects were chosen for the 2.5, 4, 6 and 8 µg doses, the anticipated safe and&#xD;
      immunogenic dose range for VAX161C. Groups of 25 subjects were chosen for the 1 and 12 µg&#xD;
      dose groups. Based on previous findings with similar vaccines, we anticipate that the 1 µg&#xD;
      group will serve as the &quot;placebo&quot; group. The purpose of the 12 µg group is to assess the&#xD;
      upper limit of safety and immunogenicity. The sample size for this study (50 subjects in each&#xD;
      of the key vaccine doses and 25 subjects in the control (1 µg group) was selected to provide&#xD;
      a robust initial safety database as well as some information on the dose-related immune&#xD;
      response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Analysis All subjects who receive at least one dose of vaccine will be considered&#xD;
      enrolled and included in the post-dosing safety analysis (safety population). The safety&#xD;
      outcome will be the occurrence of solicited complaints (identified in Section 8.2) during the&#xD;
      seven days after receiving the vaccine. These symptoms will be collected from the memory aid&#xD;
      and from the information collected at the clinic visits. All symptoms will be graded&#xD;
      according to severity. Response to vaccine will be categorized as local (arm pain, redness,&#xD;
      bruising, etc.) or systemic (headache, muscle aches, fatigue, etc.) symptoms. Local or&#xD;
      systemic reactions between vaccine dose groups will be compared to the 1 µg group by&#xD;
      two-sided Fisher's exact test. Laboratory tests such as WBC and LFTs collected before and&#xD;
      after vaccination will also be analyzed looking for differences between pre- and&#xD;
      post-vaccination and across vaccine formats. We will compare the types and severity of&#xD;
      symptoms and laboratory results based on vaccine construct.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proportions for those reporting the endpoints in the vaccine groups will be calculated and&#xD;
      analyzed using the upper boundary of a two-tailed 95% confidence interval (CI) to compare&#xD;
      against the 1 µg group. In addition, the frequency and percent of subjects in each of the&#xD;
      vaccine groups reporting each of the solicited complaints and laboratory findings will be&#xD;
      tabulated and presented with 2-sided 95% confidence intervals. A chi-square test may be used&#xD;
      to test whether the observed proportions differ from the expected proportions across dosage&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immune Response Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sera collected at Screening, Days 21 (prior to vaccination0, 42 (±2) and 180 (±10) will be&#xD;
      analyzed for determination of HAI, MN assay, serum anti-HA ELISA and serum anti-flagellin&#xD;
      ELISA. The results of these determinations will be evaluated as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Calculation of the geometric mean of pre- and post-vaccination HAI, MN assay, anti-HA,&#xD;
           and anti-flagellin serum antibody titers for each treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change from pre- to post-vaccination in geometric mean HAI, MN anti-HA, and&#xD;
           anti-flagellin serum antibody titers for each treatment group&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Seroconversion rates based on HAI response defined as percentage of subjects having a&#xD;
           pre-vaccination titer of &lt; 1:10 and a post vaccination HI titer ≥ 1:40 or a&#xD;
           pre-vaccination HI titer ≥ 1:10 and a minimum four-fold rise in post-vaccination HI&#xD;
           antibody titer).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proportion of subjects with HAI, MN, anti-HA and anti-flagellin serum antibody titers&#xD;
           before and after vaccination by treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical comparisons between the treatment groups will be provided. GMTs will be compared&#xD;
      with one-way ANOVA of log10-transformed titers and reported as GMT ratios and 95% CIs,&#xD;
      calculated on the log10 scale and transformed. Proportions of subjects that achieve&#xD;
      seroconversion for each dose will be determined by two-sided Fisher's exact test. Exact CIs&#xD;
      are reported for all proportional endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy Analysis The current protocol is not designed to evaluate the efficacy of VAX161C.&#xD;
      CLINICAL MONITORING AND ADMINISTRATION Disposition of Data A CRF will be provided for each&#xD;
      enrolled study subject. Data collected through the completion of experimental procedures&#xD;
      required by this protocol will be recorded in the subject's chart as source documentation.&#xD;
      This data will then be transcribed onto the CRF by the study staff. All data entered into the&#xD;
      CRFs will have source documentation in the form of laboratory print outs or entries into the&#xD;
      subject's chart. The Investigator remains responsible for the accuracy and adequacy of all&#xD;
      data entered on the CRFs. Under direction of the clinical monitor, CRFs will be source data&#xD;
      verified and further processed. Upon further data processing, queries may be generated and&#xD;
      sent to the Investigator for clarification or correction. The Investigator will address any&#xD;
      queries and resolutions verified by the clinical monitor. Once all CRFs are completed and&#xD;
      queries resolved, the subjects' CRFs may be locked.&#xD;
