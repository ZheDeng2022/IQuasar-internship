      The purpose of this study is to assess the pharmacokinetic parameters for ABC and 3TC in&#xD;
      HIV-infected children younger than 18 years old with body weight ≥ 14 kgs.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Abacavir (ABC) is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) and continues to have&#xD;
      good efficacy even in patients who have some resistant mutations to NRTIs. ABC is approved&#xD;
      for use in children 3 months old and up. It is a preferred NRTI option for second line&#xD;
      treatment in children in the World Health Organization guidelines (WHO). In the US and&#xD;
      European guidelines, ABC is also recommended for first line treatment. Published studies&#xD;
      support the efficacy and safety of twice and once daily ABC. In HIV-infected children &lt; 12&#xD;
      years, ABC is licensed twice-daily only. However, ABC is licensed either twice-daily or&#xD;
      once-daily for HIV-infected adults and children &gt;12 years. In addition, ABC can be&#xD;
      administered as the fixed dose combination once-daily with lamivudine (3TC), Kivexa, for&#xD;
      HIV-infected adults and children &gt;12 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lamivudine (3TC) is a commonly used NRTI that is well tolerated and approved for young&#xD;
      infants and children as a component in the first and second-line regimens in guidelines. Both&#xD;
      once-daily and twice-daily 3TC are standard practice in many treatment guidelines although&#xD;
      once-daily is US FDA-approved for age &gt; 12 years only. The Thai Ministry of Health pediatric&#xD;
      HIV treatment guideline recommend either once- or twice-daily as treatment options for&#xD;
      children. The WHO currently recommends the twice-daily 3TC dosing only and encourages more&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic studies of once-daily 3TC in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PK of ABC and 3TC in African and European children showed similar PK parameters for both&#xD;
      twice daily and once daily dosing. There are no data on PK of ABC in Asian children and few&#xD;
      studies on PK of 3TC in Thai children. Vanprapar et al. reported data in 42 Thai children&#xD;
      weighing 6-30 kg participated in a cross-over PK study in which they received twice-daily&#xD;
      dosing of generic fixed dose combination tablets of stavudine, 3TC, nevirapine or the liquid&#xD;
      formulations of these drugs. The 3TC exposure was significantly higher with the tablet&#xD;
      formulation but comparable to historical data in western adults and children taking branded&#xD;
      tablets. Chokephaibulkit et al. reported higher 3TC exposure in 41 Thai HIV-infected children&#xD;
      with 3TC tablets than 3TC solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is strong evidence indicating that Asian patients, particularly Thais, have higher&#xD;
      plasma concentrations for several ARVs compared to Westerners. Genetic differences between&#xD;
      ethnicities may be the primary cause for altered drug metabolism, and as a result, different&#xD;
      PK parameters. Higher drug concentrations in Thai adults have been shown for zidovudine,&#xD;
      nevirapine, efavirenz, indinavir, lopinavir, atazanavir and saquinavir. Such high ARV&#xD;
      concentrations were also shown in Thai children for nevirapine, indinavir, lopinavir and&#xD;
      saquinavir. There are no data in Thai children for ABC. Only two studies evaluated 3TC&#xD;
      concentration in Thai children using twice-daily dosing. It is conceivable that Thai children&#xD;
      may have different PK profile of ABC and 3TC particularly once-daily dosing and than those&#xD;
      reported in African and European children. In addition, using ABC and 3TC will provide an&#xD;
      opportunity for Thai children to benefit from its once-daily dosing and good long-term safety&#xD;
      particularly the favorable lipodystrophy and lipid profile.&#xD;
