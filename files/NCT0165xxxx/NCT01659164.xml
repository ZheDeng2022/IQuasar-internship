  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this uncontrolled pilot study is to develop and make an initial evaluation of&#xD;
      a new treatment manual for treatment of ADHD in adults. The objectives in the treatment is to&#xD;
      build relational skills, skills in organizing and structuring everyday life, handle difficult&#xD;
      emotions and impulses etc. The treatment will be in a group format and it is hypothesized&#xD;
      that the psychological intervention will result in reduced ADHD symptoms and to decreased&#xD;
      experience of stress and depressive symptoms. The uncontrolled design does not allow for any&#xD;
      causal inferences from the results, this pilot study is primarily to be seen as a preparation&#xD;
      before a subsequent RCT.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately one-third of children with ADHD continue to be fully symptomatic into adulthood&#xD;
      and many of the remainders often retain some residual problems that require treatment. Thus&#xD;
      ADHD is a prevalent and chronic disabling disorder. Drugs provide first line treatment for&#xD;
      adults with ADHD but are not enough for everybody, while we still lack proper evidence for&#xD;
      promising psychological treatment. In addition to core symptoms of ADHD including regulatory&#xD;
      difficulties of attention, activity level and impulses, difficulties with emotional&#xD;
      regulation are common.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up studies of adults with ADHD have shown that only a few patients were offered&#xD;
      sufficient treatment and support after the neuropsychiatric assessment and testing. The&#xD;
      majority of adults diagnosed with ADHD are offered pharmacological treatment (stimulant&#xD;
      medication) as the sole treatment. However, stimulant medication is not effective for up to&#xD;
      20-50 percent of adults as they may not experience symptom reduction or they are unable to&#xD;
      tolerate the medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consequently, the possible benefits of identifying and treating individuals with ADHD are&#xD;
      extensive. Treatment of ADHD is preferably multimodal, i.e. consisting of more than one&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There has been limited research to date concerning psychosocial treatments for adult ADHD.&#xD;
      Studies of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) show&#xD;
      that structured short-term therapies are promising in reducing ADHD related symptoms and&#xD;
      increasing life quality. Focus in the CBT treatment is to build skills, increasing and&#xD;
      compensating for deficits in the executive functioning due to impairments of the frontal&#xD;
      lobe. DBT combines change-oriented skills from CBT with acceptance-oriented skills and core&#xD;
      mindfulness skills. DBT skills have been tried out and validated as a promising intervention&#xD;
      package for adults with ADHD through the research of Steven Safren and Bernd Hesslinger.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the planned study is to evaluate a new manual for group treatment, with a&#xD;
      combination of treatment methods from Safrens and Hesslingers evidence-based treatment&#xD;
      manuals. The aim of the pilot project is to create a clinically effective combination of the&#xD;
      different methods of treatment, with a high degree of understanding, acceptance, use and&#xD;
      perceived usefulness of the patients undergoing treatment. Both qualitative and quantitative&#xD;
      data about patients' perceptions and use of the different methods will be collected during&#xD;
      and after treatment to increase knowledge of how treatments can be developed and combined in&#xD;
      order to better match the needs of patients.&#xD;
