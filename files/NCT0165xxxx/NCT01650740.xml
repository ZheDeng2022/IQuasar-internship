  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, there has been growing evidence that antidepressants are only marginally&#xD;
      effective compared to placebo for mild to moderate depression. In other words, although many&#xD;
      people improve when they take antidepressant medications, almost as many get better with&#xD;
      placebo pills. One possible solution to this problem would be to give patients a trail of a&#xD;
      placebo prior to giving them an antidepressant, however there are ethical issues with doing&#xD;
      this deceptively. New evidence from other placebo-responsive disorders such as irritable&#xD;
      bowel syndrome shows that people may benefit from placebos even if they know they are taking&#xD;
      them. This study aims to determine whether giving placebos without deception to people with&#xD;
      major depressive disorder followed by the option to switch to an antidepressant is an&#xD;
      effective strategy. There will be 3 groups of subjects. The first group is a standard&#xD;
      treatment arm and will receive duloxetine, an antidepressant. The second will be given a&#xD;
      placebo with the option to switch to duloxetine if they do not improve. The third group will&#xD;
      receive supportive clinical visits the option to switch to duloxetine if they do not improve.&#xD;
      This design will allow us to determine whether a sequenced treatment of a placebo without&#xD;
      deception and then the option to switch to an antidepressant is a viable strategy. It will&#xD;
      also help us to determine to what degree the benefit comes from the ritual of receiving and&#xD;
      taking the placebo tablet versus the benefit of visits with a doctor alone. The primary&#xD;
      hypothesis is that there will be a less than 5% difference between response rates after 12&#xD;
      weeks in the sequenced placebo-then-antidepressant treatment group (both subjects who have&#xD;
      remained on placebo as well as those who have switched to the antidepressant will be&#xD;
      considered as one group) compared to the immediate antidepressant therapy group.&#xD;
