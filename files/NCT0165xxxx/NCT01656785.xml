    <textblock>
      This is an open-label brain PET/CT (positron emission tomography/computed tomography) study&#xD;
      to investigate the diagnostic performance of 68Ga-BNOTA-PRGD2 in evaluation of stroke&#xD;
      patients in convalescence. A single dose of nearly 111 MBq 68Ga-BNOTA-PRGD2 ( ≤ 40 µg&#xD;
      BNOTA-PRGD2) will be intravenously injected into the patients. Visual and semi-quantitative&#xD;
      method will be used to assess the PET/CT images. Changes of 18F-FDG PET/CT, enhanced brain&#xD;
      MRI or CT, and any adverse events will be collected from the patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Integrin αvβ3 is an important member of this receptor family and expressed preferentially on&#xD;
      regenerative vascular endothelial cells, but not or very low on the quiescent vessel cells&#xD;
      and other normal cells. The αvβ3 integrin is a key mediator of angiogenesis and thus may be&#xD;
      an important diagnostic and therapeutic target associated with cerebrovascular repair&#xD;
      processes after stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tri-peptide sequence of arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) can specifically bind to the&#xD;
      integrin αvβ3 receptor. Accordingly, a variety of radiolabeled RGD-based peptides have been&#xD;
      developed for non-invasive imaging of integrin αvβ3 expression via positron emission&#xD;
      tomography (PET) or single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) to monitor the&#xD;
      angiogenesis in clinical Oncology and Cardiology. In Neurology, angiogenesis imaging based on&#xD;
      integrin αvβ3 receptor has not been found in clinical trials, but preclinical animal studies&#xD;
      showed it had great potential for clinical translation. Recently, series of RGD dimeric&#xD;
      peptides with PEG linkers have been studied. The new types of RGD peptides showed much higher&#xD;
      in vitro integrin αvβ3 binding affinity than the single RGD tri-peptide sequence. As a&#xD;
      representative, 68Ga-BNOTA-PRGD2 could be easily prepared and exhibited excellent in vivo&#xD;
      behavior in animal models and also tumor or myocardial infarction patients. No adverse&#xD;
      reactions are observed in animal models or patients to date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the further interests in clinical translation of 68Ga-BNOTA-PRGD2, an open-label brain&#xD;
      PET/CT study was designed to investigate diagnostic performance of 68Ga-BNOTA-PRGD2 in stroke&#xD;
      patients in convalescence. A single dose of nearly 111 MBq 68Ga-BNOTA-PRGD2 ( ≤ 40 µg&#xD;
      BNOTA-PRGD2) will be intravenously injected into the patients. Visual and semiquantitative&#xD;
      method will be used to assess the PET/CT images. Changes of brain 18F-FDG PET/CT, enhanced&#xD;
      brain MRI or CT, and any adverse events will be collected from the patients.&#xD;
