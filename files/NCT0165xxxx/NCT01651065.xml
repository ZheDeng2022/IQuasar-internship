    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized trial is to study the efficacy of a novel social propagation&#xD;
      intervention which integrates social network induction with health education for weight and&#xD;
      metabolic control among patients with type 2 diabetes, BMI of 25-30+, and cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease. The intervention takes place in the form of a community health program, where&#xD;
      participants who enroll in this program will be asked if they would like to take part in the&#xD;
      study to evaluate its efficacy. Thus, the investigators will study the efficacy of social&#xD;
      networks in propagating changes in lifestyle factors for diabetes and chronic disease&#xD;
      management&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The potential to harness the propagating power of social networks for chronic disease&#xD;
      treatment and management, such as for diabetes and obesity, is an emerging area in&#xD;
      epidemiology and clinical research. Social induction for disease management has been&#xD;
      effectively leveraged for disease management, but we have not carefully disaggregated of&#xD;
      different layers and modalities of social network effects in this context. This study will&#xD;
      test and demonstrate this through a novel randomized trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomized design is comprised of 2 arms. 1) Intervention Group: This arm takes part in a&#xD;
      10-month (9-month for Phase 2, cycles 1 and 2) diabetes, weight, and cardiovascular disease&#xD;
      education and management program in combination with the microclinic social support model. A&#xD;
      microclinic is a support group of 2-6 individuals from the same social network who learn how&#xD;
      to manage their disease together. 2) Control Group: This is a control arm with observational&#xD;
      parallel assessments of metabolic and lifestyle risk factors alone (implemented in Phase 1&#xD;
      and 2, cycles 1 and 2). Each arm will take part in a 6-month follow-up. The investigators&#xD;
      also aim to study the intervention effects of social networks in improving lifestyle risk&#xD;
      factors on a small sample of Phase 1 controls in a repeated measures design. Observational&#xD;
      controls with 7 repeated measures in Phase 1 (pre-intervention) will receive the 9-month&#xD;
      diabetes, weight, and cardiovascular disease education and management program with&#xD;
      microclinic social support model condensed in a 4-6 months program. The controls in this&#xD;
      cycle will also receive 17 medical screenings during the intervention, and 6-month follow-up&#xD;
      (post-intervention).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1- (Phase 1 and 2, Cycles 1 &amp; 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the efficacy of the microclinic intervention group versus observational control&#xD;
      in improving lifestyle factors and metabolic outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2- (Phase 2, Cycle 3)&#xD;
&#xD;
      To examine the effect of the microclinic intervention by comparing pre- and post measures&#xD;
      among those who were first controls in Phase 1 and then participated in the microclinic&#xD;
      intervention Phase 2, Cycle 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 3- (Phases 1 &amp; 2, cycles 1, 2, and 3)&#xD;
&#xD;
      To differentiate the modalities of social network effects: direct causal induction versus&#xD;
      homophilly, and to determine the extent of long-term temporal cross-propagating effects&#xD;
      between-persons in a microclinic group.&#xD;

    <description>The microclinic intervention leverages different levels of social networks to positively influence behaviors relating to diabetes and other metabolic conditions through small treatment units called, 'microclinic groups (MC),' consisting of 2-6 friends and family members of the same social network, which lead to a larger network of 'classes' and cohorts.&#xD;
The program provides MC subjects with shared access to health education and group support to promote glycemic and metabolic control through diet, exercise, and treatment adherence. MC members play a role in the collective effort to combat diabetes and solidifying self-management behavioral skills through peer-monitoring and encouragement of lifestyle behaviors.</description>
