  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adipose tissue (AT) has specific alterations in obesity in particular increased fibrosis&#xD;
      amount compared to lean subjects. Fibrosis amount measured by immunohistochemistry on adipose&#xD;
      biopsies appears to to predict weight loss response after a bariatric surgery. Non invasive&#xD;
      tools to measure fibrosis needs to be validated. The investigators primary aim is to validate&#xD;
      a new device able to measure adipose tissue stiffness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus the investigators plan to compare the stiffness results obtained with the device to the&#xD;
      quantification of fibrosis using immuno-chemistry in massively obese patient's candidates to&#xD;
      a bariatric surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adipose tissue (AT) has specific alterations in obesity that could link obesity to its&#xD;
      comorbidities. In particular increased fibrosis abundance in AT has been observed in obese&#xD;
      compared to lean subjects. The investigators previously observed that the amount of fibrosis&#xD;
      in AT measured at baseline could predict surgery-induced weight loss. Patient with the higher&#xD;
      amount of fibrosis at baseline were those who lost less fat mass one year after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date fibrosis can only be measured using by immunohistochemistry after surgical biopsy. To&#xD;
      that prospect, non invasive tools need to be validated, in particular device able to measure&#xD;
      adipose tissue stiffness. The investigators hypothesis is that this new device is as powerful&#xD;
      as IHC-quantified fibrosis to predict surgery induced weight loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To answer that question the investigators will evaluate adipose tissue stiffness with the&#xD;
      device as well as quantify fibrosis using immuno-chemistry on AT biopsy in morbidly obese&#xD;
      patients before and during the first year after a bariatric surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first objective is to validate the investigators new device by comparing both invasive&#xD;
      fibrosis measurement on adipose tissue and non invasive stiffness measure The investigators&#xD;
      second objective is to assess whether the investigators device can predict weight loss repose&#xD;
      after bariatric surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project is based on a clinical protocol performed in massively obese subjects (BMI&gt;40&#xD;
      kg/m² or BMI&gt;35kg/m² with comorbidities). The investigators will recruit 250 obese patients&#xD;
      addressed for bariatric surgery (bypass, sleeve or gastric banding). Clinical phenotype,&#xD;
      biochemical analysis, body composition, systemic inflammation, adipose tissue biopsy (to&#xD;
      evaluate inflammation and fibrosis) will be assessed at baseline and 3 and 12 months after&#xD;
      surgery. Also at baseline surgical sub cutaneous and omental adipose tissue (to evaluate&#xD;
      inflammation and fibrosis) as well as liver biopsy (to score non alcoholic hepatitis) will be&#xD;
      analysed. 50 non obese patients will serve as controls. Adipose tissue stiffness measured&#xD;
      with the device as well as fibrosis quantification on subcutaneous and omental adipose tissue&#xD;
      will be assessed at baseline during programmed non inflammatory abdominal surgery&#xD;
      Associations between all clinical and biological parameters will be assessed at the different&#xD;
      point of the follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More generally, this project might lead us to elucidate whether fibrosis in adipose tissue&#xD;
      can predict surgery outcome in terms of weight loss and obesity related complications&#xD;
      improvement. Also the investigators want to validate a new non invasive tool to measure&#xD;
      adipose tissue fibrosis and check whether it can predict surgery outcomes.&#xD;

    <description>In both massively obese patients and in a subgroup of lean and overweight control, adipose tissue stiffness will be assessed using the elastography non invasive device. Adipose tissue fibrosis will be evaluated using immuno-chemistry staining upon adipose tissue surgical biopsy and defined as the ratio of the surface stained with picrosirius and the surface of the biopsy. The investigators will then look for a strong statistical association between those two measures to validate our new device.</description>
