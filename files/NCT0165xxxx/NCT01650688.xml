  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epiblepharon is a very common condition among Asian children and is a fold of the skin and&#xD;
      underlying pretarsal orbicularis muscle that overlaps the eyelid margin and pushes the lashes&#xD;
      against the cornea. It is manifested by the anterior lamella overriding the posterior lamella&#xD;
      which causes the lashes to brush against the cornea. Although the prevalence of epiblepharon&#xD;
      is known to be high among Asians, its cause remains controversial. Several etiological&#xD;
      factors may be involved in the pathogenesis of epiblepharon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although epiblepharon in the lower lids lessens and disappears with age in many cases,&#xD;
      surgery must be performed at an early age in severe cases in order to prevent ocular trauma&#xD;
      as the vertically oriented cilia of the lashes can erode the corneal epithelium. Induced&#xD;
      keratitis and astigmatism are indications for surgical intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over our many years of surgical experience, the investigators came to realize that the&#xD;
      severity of epiblepharon was reduced when patients were under general anesthesia during&#xD;
      surgery. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of the orbicularis muscle in&#xD;
      the pathogenesis of lower lid epiblepharon and to analyze the differences in the severity of&#xD;
      epiblepharon in the upright versus the supine position and before and after the induction of&#xD;
      general anesthesia.&#xD;
