  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized prospective clinical trial of women with metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to test if an intervention of regular physical activity review&#xD;
      and physical activity goal setting will allow the subjects to achieve a moderate increase in&#xD;
      physical activity of 6,000 steps per week. The physical activity review will consist of&#xD;
      weekly telephone call to inquire about symptoms and to set physical activity goals. The study&#xD;
      will also look to see if the goal setting intervention will affect the time to progression,&#xD;
      change in BMI, and quality of life. Quality of life will be measured by answers to&#xD;
      questionnaires provided to subjects at regular intervals during the course of the study.&#xD;
      Finally, the study will examine the impact of physical activity on expression of tumor&#xD;
      molecular molecules, insulin levels, and estradiol levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through an intervention of regular physical activity review and goal setting, the&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that a moderate increase in level of physical activity of 6000&#xD;
      steps per week or more can be obtained by patients with metastatic breast cancer who receive&#xD;
      a goal setting intervention. The investigators propose that those who are able to achieve and&#xD;
      maintain greater than or equal to 22500 steps per week will demonstrate biologic and&#xD;
      molecular differences compared to those who are not able to achieve that level of physical&#xD;
      activity. The investigators expect that people who are more active will have longer to&#xD;
      progression.&#xD;
