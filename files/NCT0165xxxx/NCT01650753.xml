  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Healthy adults referred to as the absence of intestinal disorders, liver and kidney problems,&#xD;
      lactose intolerance, and no use of ongoing medication for chronic diseases will be recruited.&#xD;
      This research study will test the persistence of the probiotic (healthy bacterial) strain&#xD;
      Bifidobacterium longum spp. longum in the human gastrointestinal tract after it is consumed,&#xD;
      how it is tolerated, and its interactions with other micro-organisms already present in your&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract. The strain used is similar to bacteria used in probiotic yogurts, and&#xD;
      the species Bifidobacterium is generally regarded as safe. The patient will be asked to will&#xD;
      be consume a probiotic powder containing Bifidobacterium longum spp. longum strain AH1206 and&#xD;
      a placebo in a random order, with neither the patient nor the investigators knowing the&#xD;
      identity of the preparations given. Persistence or presence of the probiotic strain will be&#xD;
      based on analysis of fecal (stool or bowel movement) samples provided.&#xD;

      The study will be performed as a 14 week randomized crossover trial with two treatments, one&#xD;
      of which is the placebo. The randomization design will be provided by collaborators at Mead&#xD;
      Johnson, and the study will be performed double blinded, such that no study staff will be&#xD;
      informed about the nature of the product. Each treatment period will consist of a one week&#xD;
      baseline period, in which one fecal sample will be collected. This will be followed by a two&#xD;
      week feeding period in which the probiotic will be administered at a constant dose of 10^10&#xD;
      cells per day in 50 to 100 ml of either cold or room temperature tab water. At day 7 and 14&#xD;
      (last day of feeding), a fecal sample will be collected. The last sample during feeding will&#xD;
      also serve as day 0 of Test of Persistence (TOP) period. Persistence of the probiotic strains&#xD;
      will be tested during the TOP period at day 4, 8, 16, and 28 (4 weeks) for a total of 7 fecal&#xD;
      samples. The subjects will then crossover to the other treatment and the above fecal sample&#xD;
      collections will be repeated. Fecal samples will be provided by the subjects using disposable&#xD;
      stool collection containers not longer than 2 hours after defecation. In the lab fecal&#xD;
      samples will be stored undiluted (four aliquots) and as 1/10 dilutions in PBS buffer (four&#xD;
      aliquots). The investigators will also prepare five tubes with 1 gram aliquots of each fecal&#xD;
      sample and will provide these samples de-identified to Mead Johnson Nutrition for future&#xD;
      analyses. Experimental design. Fecal samples will be studied by qRT-PCR. Fecal samples may be&#xD;
      subjected to pyrosequencing and selective culturing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will fill out a Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) questionnaire (at&#xD;
      week GSRS at week 1, 2, 3, 4 and 8, 9, 10 11) to test the acceptance and safety of the&#xD;
      strain, and to test if subjects remain eligible for the study. Weeks 1 and 8 are the baseline&#xD;
      visits, weeks 4 and 11 are one week after subject stops taking study product. Subjects that&#xD;
      have begun or expect to begin antibiotic treatment or that have experienced unacceptable side&#xD;
      effects will stop their participation.&#xD;
