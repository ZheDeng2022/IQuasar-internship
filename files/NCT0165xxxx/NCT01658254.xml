      The gap between the high number of registered trials and the few ones where results were&#xD;
      available (in registries or in journals) has been identified as a major problem distorting&#xD;
      the scientific evidence available. As a consequence, the FDAAA (Food and Drug Administration&#xD;
      Amendments Act) added on September 27, 2007 a requirements policy regarding publication of&#xD;
      summary results on the publicly accessible registry ClinicalTrials.gov. Reporting of summary&#xD;
      results is required for &quot;applicable clinical trials&quot; no later than one year after the&#xD;
      &quot;primary completion date&quot;, i.e. the date of collection of primary outcome data on the last&#xD;
      patient to be enrolled. 'Applicable clinical trials', is the term used in the FDAAA to&#xD;
      designate trials that may be subject to the registration and reporting requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Not complying with the reporting requirements can result in penalties, such as withholding of&#xD;
      National Institute of Health grant or funding and civil monetary penalties of up to $10,000 a&#xD;
      day. Despite the possibility of incurring penalties for not complying with the posting&#xD;
      requirement, compliance remains globally poor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this current study, the primary objective will be to test the hypothesis that sending an&#xD;
      email looking as a survey, reminding the necessity of posting results to the trials'&#xD;
      responsible parties registered in ClinicalTrials.gov and subject to mandatory reporting but&#xD;
      not complying with it, will increase the results posting rate.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to the recommendation of 2005 by International Committee of Medical Journal Editors&#xD;
      (ICMJE), clinical trials must be registered before enrolment of the first patient in a free&#xD;
      registry recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO). The goal is to improve&#xD;
      transparency of clinical research. The ClinicalTrials.gov trial registry, initiated&#xD;
      subsequently to the US Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act (FDAMA) in 1997, is the&#xD;
      widest used registry, and contains more than 121 000 studies located in 179 countries (data&#xD;
      of March 1, 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gap between the high number of registered trials and the few ones where results were&#xD;
      available (in registries or in journals) has been identified as a major problem distorting&#xD;
      the scientific evidence available, and inducing publication bias. As a consequence, the FDAAA&#xD;
      (Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act) added on September 27, 2007 a requirements&#xD;
      policy regarding publication of summary results on the publicly accessible registry&#xD;
      ClinicalTrials.gov. Reporting of summary results is required for &quot;applicable clinical trials&quot;&#xD;
      no later than one year after the &quot;primary completion date&quot;, i.e. the date of collection of&#xD;
      primary outcome data on the last patient to be enrolled. 'Applicable clinical trials', is the&#xD;
      term used in the FDAAA to designate trials that may be subject to the registration and&#xD;
      reporting requirements. They include interventional controlled studies registered after the&#xD;
      enactment of the FDAAA (or ongoing at this date), involving drugs, biologics, or devices&#xD;
      (only after FDA-approved for any use), regardless of sponsorship; phases II through IV;&#xD;
      located at least in one U.S. site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The entity or individual responsible for registering and posting basic results is called the&#xD;
      'responsible party'. This term refers to the sponsor of the study or the principal&#xD;
      investigator of the study, if so designated by a sponsor, grantee, contractor, or awardee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In certain circumstances, delayed submission of results information with certification can be&#xD;
      allowed. Not complying with the reporting requirements can result in penalties, such as&#xD;
      withholding of National Institute of Health grant or funding and civil monetary penalties of&#xD;
      up to $10,000 a day. Despite the possibility of incurring penalties for not complying with&#xD;
      the posting requirement, compliance remains globally poor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this current study, the primary objective will be to test the hypothesis that sending an&#xD;
      email asking to answer a survey, reminding the necessity of posting results to the trials'&#xD;
      responsible parties registered in ClinicalTrials.gov and subject to mandatory reporting but&#xD;
      not complying with it, will increase the results posting rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective will be to investigate the reasons given by the trials' responsible&#xD;
      parties for not posting summary results onto the registry.&#xD;

    <description>The intervention consists in an email to be sent to the sponsor and/or principal investigator of randomly assigned trials. This email will notify them that their trial's primary completion date is over a year old and will ask the reasons why they have not posted results on the registry. Several reasons will be proposed, and investigators or sponsors will be asked to reply by sending back an email or through a website where the same questions will appear. A follow-up email will systematically be sent 7 days after, with similar content (appendix2). The emails will be sent as direct emails, without attached files, with the edit subject &quot;Posting basic results&quot;. The controlled group will receive no intervention.</description>
