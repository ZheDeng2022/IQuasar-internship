  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of T cells&#xD;
      that can be given in combination with standard chemotherapy to patients with CLL. The safety&#xD;
      of this combination will also be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The T cells being used in this study are a type of white blood cell that will be taken from&#xD;
      your blood and then genetically changed in a laboratory. The process of changing the DNA (the&#xD;
      genetic material of cells) of the T cells is called a gene transfer. After the gene transfer&#xD;
      is complete, the genetically changed T-cells will be put back into your body. These T cells&#xD;
      may help prevent cancer cells from coming back.&#xD;

      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a dose&#xD;
      level of genetically changed T cells, based on when you joined this study. Up to 4 dose&#xD;
      levels of T cells will be tested. Up to 3 participants will be enrolled at each dose level.&#xD;
      The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level. Each new group will&#xD;
      receive a higher dose of than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen.&#xD;
      This will continue until the highest tolerable dose of T cells is found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive the same dose of chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      T Cell Collection (leukapheresis or standard blood draw):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 30 days after you have completed the screening tests, you will have leukapheresis&#xD;
      performed at the Apheresis Clinic at MD Anderson.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the leukapheresis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your height, weight, and vital&#xD;
           signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your medical history will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to measure levels of&#xD;
           certain proteins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A leukapheresis is a procedure used to remove blood from the body so that specific blood&#xD;
      cells, such as T cells, can be collected. After the specific cells have been collected, the&#xD;
      remaining blood is returned to the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To perform a leukapheresis, blood will be drawn through a needle in a vein in one arm, then&#xD;
      passed though a machine to collect white blood cells, and then the remaining blood will be&#xD;
      returned back to you through a needle in a vein in the other arm. The procedure will take&#xD;
      about 3 hours to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the doctor thinks it is in your best interest, instead of having a leukapheresis, blood&#xD;
      (about 13.5 tablespoons) will be drawn to collect white blood cells instead.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If certain types of unwanted T cells are growing too much, an investigational device called a&#xD;
      CliniMACS® system will be used to filter out the unwanted T cells using a magnet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will take about 7 weeks to modify and grow the necessary number of genetically modified T&#xD;
      cells in the lab. If researchers are not able to collect enough T cells for your assigned&#xD;
      dose level, you will be taken off study. Other options will be discussed with you by your&#xD;
      doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemotherapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before you receive the T cell infusion, you will receive your standard chemotherapy with&#xD;
      fludarabine and cyclophosphamide through a catheter (plastic tube) inserted into a large&#xD;
      chest vein or through an intravenous needle (IV) inserted in a vein in your arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fludarabine will be given by vein over 30 minutes daily for 3 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cyclophosphamide will be given by vein over 3 hours daily for 3 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Tests Before the T cell Infusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 60 days before the T cell infusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any side effects that you may have had.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for tests to look at your DNA to check the&#xD;
           status of the disease. This may be performed any time before or during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mouse protein antibodies are used in the gene transfer process. If your body becomes&#xD;
           immune to these proteins, your body may develop antibodies against the mouse antibodies&#xD;
           (called &quot;human anti-mouse antibodies&quot; or HAMA). Part of the blood sample will be used to&#xD;
           compare against another sample of blood collected after the gene transfer is complete to&#xD;
           check for HAMA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an echocardiogram (ECHO) or multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan to check&#xD;
           your heart function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have lung function tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the study doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a bone marrow biopsy/aspiration&#xD;
           to check the status of the disease. To collect a bone marrow biopsy/aspirate, an area of&#xD;
           the hip or chest bone is numbed with anesthetic, and a small amount of bone and bone&#xD;
           marrow is withdrawn through a large needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the study doctor thinks it is needed, you will have computed tomography (CT) scans&#xD;
           and/or positron emission tomography (PET) scans to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 7 days before starting chemotherapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight, and vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your medical history will be reviewed and any updates will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any side effects that you may have had.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests. Part of this blood sample&#xD;
           will be used for a pregnancy test if you are able to become pregnant. To continue your&#xD;
           participation in this study, you cannot be pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      T-cell Infusion (gene transfer):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The T cell infusion will be given by vein over about 15-30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the infusion, you will receive drugs to lower your risk of allergic reaction to the T&#xD;
      cells. Tylenol® (acetaminophen) will be given by mouth and Benadryl® (diphenhydramine) may be&#xD;
      given by mouth or by vein over a few minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your vital signs will be checked during and after the T cell infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Tests after the T cell infusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 3 days, 1 week (+/- 2 days), 2 weeks (+/- 3 days), 1 month (+/- 7 days), 6 months (+/-&#xD;
      14 days), and 12 months (+/- 14 days) after the T-cell infusion, the following tests and&#xD;
      procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your medical history will be reviewed and any updates will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any side effects that may have had.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, tests to measure levels of&#xD;
           certain proteins, and tests to look at your DNA to check the status of the disease. Part&#xD;
           of this blood sample will be used to compare against a sample of blood that was&#xD;
           collected before the gene transfer to check for HAMA (at 6 months after the T cell&#xD;
           infusion only). At 1, 6, and 12 months after the T-cell infusions, part of this blood&#xD;
           sample will be used to measure levels of certain proteins.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn to learn how your body's immune system&#xD;
           responds to the T-cell infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At around 6 and 12 months after the T-cell infusion, if the study doctor thinks it is needed&#xD;
      you will have CT scans, PET-CT scans, and/or a bone marrow biopsy to check the status of the&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation on this study will be over after you have completed the last planned study&#xD;
      visit at about 12 months after the T cell infusion is complete. You may be taken off study&#xD;
      early if the disease gets worse, you experience any intolerable side effects, you cannot keep&#xD;
      your appointments, if your doctor thinks it is in your best interest, or if you are unable to&#xD;
      receive the T-cell infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you leave the study early for any reason and you received T-cells, if possible, blood&#xD;
      (about 2 teaspoons) will be collected. This blood sample will be used to compare against&#xD;
      another sample of blood collected after the gene transfer is complete to check for HAMA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-Term Follow-Up Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For safety reasons, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires that patients who&#xD;
      receive stem cells infusions that have been treated with a gene transfer procedure must have&#xD;
      long-term follow-up for at least 15 years after receiving the gene transfer. You will be&#xD;
      asked to sign a separate consent form for a long-term follow-up study Protocol 2006-0676.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Fludarabine and cyclophosphamide are commercially available&#xD;
      and FDA approved for the treatment of CLL. The T cell infusion using a gene transfer&#xD;
      procedure is not commercially available or FDA approved. At this time, T cell infusions using&#xD;
      a gene transfer procedure is only being used in research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 30 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
