      The primary objective is to determine the effect of repeated oral doses of eliglustat 150 mg&#xD;
      twice daily (BID) on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of orally administered metoprolol 50 mg in&#xD;
      healthy adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to assess the safety and tolerability of a single oral dose of&#xD;
      metoprolol 50 mg when administered alone and in combination with repeated oral doses of&#xD;
      eliglustat 150 mg BID in healthy adults.&#xD;

             other grapefruit-containing products for 72 hours prior to the first dose of study&#xD;
             drug until completion of the safety follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. The subject is willing and able to maintain a normal-fiber diet (i.e., to abstain from&#xD;

             medically accepted form of contraception (as defined in the protocol) from screening&#xD;
             until 30 days after the last dose of study drug. A woman of childbearing potential is&#xD;
             defined as any female who has not been amenorrheic for at least 2 years or has not&#xD;
             undergone a hysterectomy or surgical sterilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The subject is classified as a cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) poor metabolizer (or an&#xD;
             indeterminate metabolizer with neither allele known to be active) based on results of&#xD;
             CYP2D6 genotyping performed at screening. (Note: Prior CYP2D6 genotyping results may&#xD;
             be used for the purpose of determining study eligibility if a copy of the laboratory&#xD;
             report is available and the genotyping results can be interpreted with the same&#xD;
             classification system used by the study reference laboratory.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The subject has a digestive disorder, including malabsorption, gastroenteritis,&#xD;
             pancreatitis, gastroesophageal reflux disease, inflammatory bowel disease (including&#xD;
             Crohn's disease), or any other digestive disorder which, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             Investigator, may affect oral bioavailability (e.g., clinically significant&#xD;
             constipation, diverticulitis, or irritable bowel syndrome).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The subject has had a gastrointestinal (GI) surgical procedure that might affect drug&#xD;
             transit time, (e.g., cholecystectomy, GI bypass surgery, partial or total gastrectomy,&#xD;
             or small bowel resection).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The subject has any of the following: Clinically significant coronary artery disease&#xD;
             including history of myocardial infarction or ongoing signs or symptoms consistent&#xD;
             with cardiac ischemia or heart failure; clinically significant arrhythmias or&#xD;
             conduction defect such as 2nd or 3rd degree atrioventricular (AV) block, a PR interval&#xD;
             ≥200 msec, complete bundle branch block, prolonged QTc interval (e.g., repeated&#xD;
             demonstration of a QTc interval ≥430 msec for male subjects and ≥450 msec for female&#xD;
             subjects), sustained ventricular tachycardia, heart rate &lt;55 beats/min, or systolic&#xD;
             blood pressure &lt;110 mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The subject has a clinically significant organic disease, including cardiovascular,&#xD;
             renal, hepatic, gastrointestinal, pulmonary, neurologic, endocrine, metabolic, or&#xD;
             psychiatric disease, or other medical condition, serious intercurrent illness, or&#xD;
             extenuating circumstance that, in the opinion of the Investigator, precludes&#xD;

&#xD;
          6. The subject has a disease, clinical finding, or any contraindication that would&#xD;
             prohibit the use of metoprolol in a phase 1 study (i.e., risk of disease exacerbation&#xD;
             outweighs benefit). Examples of these are clinical findings of glucose intolerance,&#xD;
             poor arterial peripheral circulation or bronchospastic disease including asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;

             exception of nonprescription-strength ibuprofen and acetaminophen, topical&#xD;
             non-steroidal preparations, and topical hydrocortisone (up to 1% strength)) or dietary&#xD;
             or herbal or fiber supplement within 30 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer)&#xD;
             prior to the first dose of study drug without the approval of both the Investigator&#xD;
             and Sponsor.&#xD;

&#xD;
         12. The subject has a screening laboratory test result above the upper limit of normal for&#xD;
             any of the following liver function tests: aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine&#xD;
             aminotransferase (ALT), gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT), and total bilirubin.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. The subject tests positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody, hepatitis&#xD;

             (inpatient or outpatient), during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. The subject has a history of cancer, with the exception of basal cell carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. The female subject of childbearing potential is pregnant or lactating.&#xD;
&#xD;
