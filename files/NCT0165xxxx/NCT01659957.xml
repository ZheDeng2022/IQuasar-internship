    <textblock>
      In treating alcoholism, many studies show Behavioral Couples Therapy (BCT) is more effective&#xD;
      than typical counseling, but BCT is not widely used because standard BCT delivered one couple&#xD;
      at a time is costly to deliver and does not fit with the primary group therapy focus of most&#xD;
      community clinics. The proposed study will test with married or cohabiting alcoholic patients&#xD;
      whether a group format for BCT will produce similar positive outcomes as standard BCT, and&#xD;
      deliver these results at a lower cost. If outcomes are favorable, this could prompt clinics&#xD;
      to start using group BCT and improve outcomes for alcoholic patients and their families.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple studies indicate that participation in Behavioral Couples Therapy (BCT) is&#xD;
      associated with robust positive outcomes for alcoholic and drug-abusing patients, in terms of&#xD;
      reduced substance use and improved relationship functioning. Yet, community-based treatment&#xD;
      programs rarely offer BCT to incoming eligible patients. As reported by providers and&#xD;
      administrators in a national survey of treatment programs in the U.S., BCT was viewed as&#xD;
      prohibitively labor intensive, due in large measure to its standard conjoint&#xD;
      one-couple-at-a-time delivery format. Given the public policy climate that is now emphasizing&#xD;
      not only clinical effectiveness, but also economic accountability, an intervention's&#xD;
      efficiency (i.e., the ratio of effectiveness to program resources used to provide the&#xD;
      service) is a critical factor in decisions by treatment programs to adopt new interventions.&#xD;
      Although BCT has well-proven efficacy, the consensus of providers and administrators is that&#xD;
      BCT is not efficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address these issues, we have studied couples group formats to deliver BCT. First, in&#xD;
      earlier work the PI developed a 10-week BCT group with a number of conjoint sessions added&#xD;
      before to prepare couples and afterwards to prevent relapse. While the outcomes were&#xD;
      favorable, the added conjoint sessions and the closed group that once begun did not add&#xD;
      additional members made it a hard sell for community agencies looking for briefer treatments&#xD;
      and typically running ongoing groups with new members added regularly. Second, to overcome&#xD;
      these problems, the PI and Co-PI developed a 10-session ongoing BCT group format that has&#xD;
      rotating content and rolling admissions in which couples join the group, complete 10&#xD;
      sessions, and &quot;graduate&quot;. A major advantage of this ongoing group format for BCT is that it&#xD;
      fits with the way other types of groups generally are run in substance abuse programs. It got&#xD;
      favorable reviews in provider focus groups and showed promise in a pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pilot study with married or cohabiting male drug-abusing patients examined the efficacy&#xD;
      of a multi-couple group therapy version of BCT (G-BCT) compared to standard conjoint BCT&#xD;
      (S-BCT), and individual-based treatment (group and individual counseling) for the patient&#xD;
      only. Results showed G-BCT yielded equivalent outcomes when compared to S-BCT, in terms of&#xD;
      reduction in substance use and improved relationship adjustment, but GBCT was less costly to&#xD;
      deliver and had superior cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness. Both G-BCT and S-BCT yielded&#xD;
      better clinical and cost-outcomes than individual-based treatment. Also, a small-scale&#xD;
      evaluation study indicated G-BCT was more likely to be used in community-based treatment&#xD;
      programs than S-BCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, this proposed study will conduct a randomized clinical trial to examine the clinical&#xD;
      effectiveness, in terms of substance use, relationship functioning, and psychosocial&#xD;
      adjustment, of Group BCT (G-BCT) versus Standard BCT (S-BCT) for 160 alcoholic patients and&#xD;
      their nonsubtance-abusing partners. Given the likely differences in cost of treatment&#xD;
      delivery between the 2 interventions, we will also examine the comparative cost-benefit and&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of the 2 intervention packages.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        (a) both members of the couple must be between 18 and 65 years of age; (b) patient must&#xD;
        meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV; American Psychiatric&#xD;
        Association, 1994) criteria for current (past 12 months) alcohol dependence and alcohol&#xD;
        must be the patient's primary substance of abuse as determined by a clinical algorithm&#xD;
        (Fals-Stewart, Stappenbeck et al, 2004); (c) be married to their current partner for at&#xD;
        least 1 year or be cohabiting in a stable common-law relationship for 2 years; (d) patient&#xD;
        agrees to a goal of abstinence from alcohol and drugs at least for the duration of the&#xD;
        12-week study-based treatment; (e) patient drank in past 60 days; (f) patient agrees to&#xD;
        forego other alcoholism counseling except for self-help meetings (e.g., AA) or treatment&#xD;
        required for a clinical emergency or clinical deterioration for the duration of the 12-week&#xD;
        study-based treatment; (g) no more than 4 months living apart in past year; (h) alcohol&#xD;
        dependent patient and partner currently living with each other, i.e., not separated or&#xD;
        planning divorce; and (i) both alcohol dependent patient and the relationship partner are&#xD;
        willing to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        a) partner meets DSM-IV criteria for a substance use disorder (other than nicotine) in the&#xD;
        last 12 months; (b) patient has dependence on alcohol or other drugs that requires&#xD;
        inpatient treatment or medical detoxification (as indicated by daily heavy use or use to&#xD;
        prevent or deal with withdrawal symptoms) - after patient has completed detoxification, he&#xD;
        or she may be eligible for the study; (c) patient or partner are at immediate risk for&#xD;
        suicide or homicide or either made a suicide attempt in past 30 days; and (d) patient or&#xD;
        partner meets DSM-IV criteria for a current organic mental disorder, schizophrenia,&#xD;
        delusional (paranoid) disorder, or any of the other psychotic disorders. The SCID-IV (SCID;&#xD;
        First, Spitzer, Gibbon, &amp; Williams, 1995) will be used to screen out participants with&#xD;
        psychosis or thought disorder. Subjects with other disorders, however, will not be&#xD;
        excluded. Consistent with general AdCare Hospital services, the AdCare physician can&#xD;
        prescribe psychiatric medication (e.g., antidepressants) if necessary. Finally, we also&#xD;
        will exclude couples with a recent history (past 3 years) of severe partner violence on a&#xD;
        day when drinking or drug use did not occur or if either member of the couple expresses&#xD;
        fear that couples therapy may put him or her at risk of violence.&#xD;
