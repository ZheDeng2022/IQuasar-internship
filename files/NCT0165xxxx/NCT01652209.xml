  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Through the injection of Hearticellgram-AMI into acute myocardial infarction patients who are&#xD;
      the primary targets of the drug, long term efficacy in the improvement of the left ventricle&#xD;
      ejection fraction upon the first cell treatment is to be evaluated and compared with the&#xD;
      current existing treatments (contemporary drug treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will also compare the efficacy and safety of single dose of hearticellgram-AMI.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We are enrolling a patient who had successful conventional percutaneous coronary intervention&#xD;
      after acute myocardial infarction. Patients are allocated to one of three groups&#xD;
      (group1=comparator, group2= one dose of hearticellgram-AMI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      single dose of hearticellgram-AMI have been attained new drug approval from MFDS (related to&#xD;
      NCT01392105).&#xD;
