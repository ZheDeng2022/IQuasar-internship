  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Phenazopyridine HCl Tablets,&#xD;
      USP 200 mg as a short term analgesic treatment of pain upon urination associated with&#xD;
      Uncomplicated Urinary Tract Infections (uUTI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary exploratory objective is to evaluate safety and efficacy of Phenazopyridine HCl&#xD;
      Tablets, USP 200 mg as a short term analgesic treatment of burning upon urination associated&#xD;
      with uUTI.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will make separate self-assessments for severity of pain and burning upon urination&#xD;
      using the NRS and self-assessments of their discomfort using the GSAS at designated intervals&#xD;
      for 24 hours. Subjects will rate the effectiveness of the study medication using the SASMS at&#xD;
      a designated interval for 24 hours.&#xD;
