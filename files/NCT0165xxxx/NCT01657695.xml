  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our long-term objective is to develop a new tool based on a (molecular-biology) integrated&#xD;
      imaging technology able to characterize and categorize hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)&#xD;
      patients in need of liver transplant (LT). To this end, our study aims at correlating&#xD;
      specific imaging traits and fractional growth of individual tumors collected over a&#xD;
      restricted time frame (T0 and at week 7 after first tumor detection), with a &quot;molecular&#xD;
      signature&quot;, obtained by custom microarray, histochemical and cytokine analysis. This should&#xD;
      allow us to translate a series of purely morphologic information into a meaningful&#xD;
      pathobiologic data sets. Validation of the integrated molecular-imaging tool will be&#xD;
      performed prospectively by correlating the imaging-molecular data with HCC outcome in term of&#xD;
      survival and disease-free survival after down staging procedures.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Organ allocation in our region is regulated according to MELD score. Patients with&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) receive an additional score depending on size of the tumor and&#xD;
      the time spent in transplant waiting list. However, the advantage given to these patients is&#xD;
      uniform and does not take into account the profound biological heterogeneity of individual&#xD;
      HCCs. To make the additional score righteous, the investigators need to identify patients&#xD;
      with aggressively growing HCC who require salvage transplantation while those with&#xD;
      slow-growing HCC do not deserve the additional score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All cirrhotics with suspect HCC identified at routine US screening will be therefore enrolled&#xD;
      in the prospective imaging and bio-molecular study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will be subjected to two computed tomography (CT) exams at 7 weeks interval to define&#xD;
      fractional tumor growth and imaging traits, baseline US-guided liver biopsy for microarray&#xD;
      and histochemical characterization, serum sampling for cytokine assay. Survival, disease-free&#xD;
      survival after downstaging and transplant outcome will be recorded and analyzed in relation&#xD;
      with imaging and molecular data. The investigators expect to set up an accurate imaging and&#xD;
      molecular diagnostic tool able to identify patients with aggressive HCC requiring urgent&#xD;
      access to transplant, reliable in predicting survival, standardisable and not too expensive.&#xD;

      We have designed custom arrays selecting those genes that, on the basis of literature and our&#xD;
      own data, will be most informative regarding molecular pathways of relevance for HCC onset&#xD;
      and progression and which have been already associated with decreased survival. These genes&#xD;
      belong to cell cycle, apoptosis, cell proliferation, cell signaling, hypoxia and&#xD;
      metastasis-prone pathways.&#xD;
