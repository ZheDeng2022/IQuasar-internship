  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oxalate restricted diet is routinely prescribed in clinical practice of nephrolithiasis&#xD;
      patients with hyperoxaluria. The effect of dietary oxalate on urinary oxalate is however&#xD;
      controversial. Some studies do not implicate dietary oxalate as a major risk factor for&#xD;
      nephrolithiasis. The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, which is high in&#xD;
      fruits and vegetables, moderate in low-fat dairy products, and low in animal protein&#xD;
      represents a novel potential means of kidney stone prevention. The effect of a DASH-style&#xD;
      diet on relative urinary supersaturations is however uncertain. Higher consumption of fruits&#xD;
      and vegetables may increase urinary oxalate but also increases urinary citrate, an important&#xD;
      inhibitor of calcium saturation.All the above data lead us to hypothesize that a DASH diet&#xD;
      other than an oxalate restricted diet, which is routinely administered in clinical practice,&#xD;
      might be beneficial in lowering urinary relative supersaturations of calcium oxalate in&#xD;
      recurrent stone formers with hyperoxaluria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recurrent stone formers with hyperoxaluria (urine oxalate&gt;32.8) are allocated into 2 groups.&#xD;
      The first group is prescribed an oxalate restricted diet. The second group are asked to&#xD;
      follow a calorie-controlled DASH diet plan while drink water in the same amounts. 24-h urine&#xD;
      is collected 2 times before study visits at baseline, 1 time on week 6 and 2 times at the end&#xD;
      of the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After a run-in period of 3 weeks patients are allocated into 2 groups. The first group is&#xD;
      prescribed an oxalate restricted diet. They are instructed to avoid oxalate-rich foods such&#xD;
      as spinach, rhubarb, beets, chocolate, cereals, nuts, tea, wheat bran, and strawberries and&#xD;
      to drink water in amounts of roughly 2 L during cold weather and 3 L during warm/hot weather.&#xD;
      The second group is asked to follow a calorie-controlled DASH diet plan. DASH is an eating&#xD;
      pattern recommended by the 2005 Department of Health and Human Services Dietary Guidelines&#xD;
      for Americans as a model of healthy eating for the majority of individuals in the population&#xD;
      . This group eats a diet which includes higher fruit, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products&#xD;
      and lower in saturated fat, total fat, and cholesterol, containing more whole grains and&#xD;
      fewer refined grains, sweets, and red meat. The calcium, potassium, and magnesium of the DASH&#xD;
      diet is higher. The DASH diet contains 2,400 mg Na per day . The servings, mentioned in the&#xD;
      publication of the National Institutes of Health regarding the DASH eating plan, are used as&#xD;
      a practical guideline. Lower consumption of meat and higher consumption of low-fat dairies,&#xD;
      vegetable, fruit, whole-grain cereals, and legumes distinguish between the DASH trial and the&#xD;
      weight-reduction diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We determine the caloric needs for each person in both groups individually according to the&#xD;
      Harris Benedict Formula:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metric BMR Formula Women: BMR= 655 + ( 9.6 × weight in kilos ) + ( 1.8 × height in cm ) - (&#xD;
      4.7 × age in years ) Men: BMR= 66 + ( 13.7 × weight in kilos ) + ( 5 × height in cm ) - ( 6.8&#xD;
      × age in years )&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine their total daily calorie needs, multiply their BMR by the appropriate activity&#xD;
      factor, as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If they are sedentary (little or no exercise) : Calorie-Calculation = BMR × 1.2 If they are&#xD;
      lightly active (light exercise/sports 1-3 days/week) : Calorie-Calculation = BMR × 1.375 If&#xD;
      they are moderately active (moderate exercise/sports 3-5 days/week) : Calorie-Calculation =&#xD;
      BMR × 1.55 If they are very active (hard exercise/sports 6-7 days a week) :&#xD;
      Calorie-Calculation = BMR × 1.725 If they are extra active (very hard exercise/sports &amp;&#xD;
      physical job or 2x training) : Calorie-Calculation = BMR × 1.9&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients are visited in the beginning, after 6 weeks and at the end of the study; each&#xD;
      session for a patient is 45-60 min. They are in touch with the nutritionist by phone every&#xD;
      week. The nutritionist explains the benefits of each diet for patients and tells them if they&#xD;
      continue these diets, related metabolic abnormalities might be controlled. The diets are&#xD;
      individually prescribed using a calorie count system, and an exchange list is given to each&#xD;
      patient for exchanging food items and counting the calories. A nutritionist educates subjects&#xD;
      on how to use the exchange list. Patient compliance to diet is evaluated by a detailed food&#xD;
      recall for 3 days which are collected from 2 weekdays and 1 weekend day in week 1 and week 12&#xD;
      as well as evaluation of the urinary excretion of sodium, inorganic sulfate and total&#xD;
      nitrogen. The food recalls are reviewed by a nutrition PhD when they are submitted and then&#xD;
      are analyzed using nutritionist IV software. 24-h urine is also collected 2 times before&#xD;
      study visits at baseline, and 2 times at the end of the study on the day food recalls are&#xD;
      filled. Urinary supersaturation of calcium oxalate, calcium phosphate and uric acid also is&#xD;
      calculated at the beginning and end of the study. Because this is a dietary intervention,&#xD;
      patients are not blinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical measurements included blood pressure, weight, height, and waist circumference. Blood&#xD;
      pressure measurements are the average of 2 measurements and are taken using an automated&#xD;
      system after the subjects are seated for 5 minutes. Participants are weighed wearing minimal&#xD;
      clothing and without shoes. Height is measured in a standing position, without shoes. Waist&#xD;
      circumference is measured where the waist is narrowest over light clothing. Body mass index&#xD;
      (kg/m2) is calculated as weight (kg) divided by height squared (m2) We use General Linear&#xD;
      Models (paired t tests) to globally compare means of all variables at the end of the 2&#xD;
      different diet periods with and without adjustment for weight. We calculate the percent&#xD;
      change for each variable using the formula (E- B/B)×100, where E was the end of treatment&#xD;
      value and B was the baseline value. Groups are compared using the percent change in the&#xD;
      General Linear Model (paired t test)analyses. We use ANCOVA to compare adjusted means of end&#xD;
      values and percent changes while weight change was included as a covariate. Results are&#xD;
      considered significant if the 2-tailed P-value is&lt;,0.05. Statistical analyses are performed&#xD;
      using STATA 15.0.&#xD;
