  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of repeated daily administration of&#xD;
      rifampicin on the pharmacokinetics (what the body does to the medication) of abiraterone&#xD;
      following single-dose administration of abiraterone acetate tablets in healthy male&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), single-center&#xD;
      (study conducted at one site), 2-period, sequential-design (studies that combine both&#xD;
      longitudinal and cross sectional methods), to evaluate the effects of rifampicin on the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of abiraterone acetate in healthy male participants. The study consists of a&#xD;
      screening phase, an open-label treatment phase, and a follow up phase. The screening phase&#xD;
      will be within 14 days before the first study medication administration. The treatment phase&#xD;
      will consist of 2 treatment periods, Period 1: a single oral dose of abiraterone acetate&#xD;
      tablets, and Period 2: a daily oral dose of rifampicin capsules alongwith a single oral dose&#xD;
      of abiraterone acetate tablets. The 2 periods will be separated by a washout period of at&#xD;
      least 7 days. Blood sample collection for pharmacokinetic assessments will be done for&#xD;
      determination of abiraterone and rifampicin concentrations. The follow up phase will be of 14&#xD;
      days. Safety evaluations for adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, electrocardiogram,&#xD;
      vital signs, and physical examinations will be monitored throughout the study. The total&#xD;
      study duration will be approximately 31 days.&#xD;
