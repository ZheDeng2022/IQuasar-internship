      The purpose of this study is to examine the role of genetic variation in the oxidative stress&#xD;
      response on critical perioperative and short-term outcomes after neonatal heart surgery. The&#xD;
      goals will be to determine 1) if the oxidative stress pathway is an important one for&#xD;
      therapeutic intervention in neonates with severe congenital heart defects and 2) if variants&#xD;
      in the oxidative response pathway can be used to identify patients at increased risk for&#xD;
      adverse outcomes.&#xD;

      For physicians caring for children with congenital cardiac defects, perhaps the greatest&#xD;
      challenge is to improve the survival and functional outcomes of patients with severe defects&#xD;
      requiring surgical repair or palliation in the first month of life. These cardiac defects can&#xD;
      be associated with 5 year mortality rates of up to 30% with significant disabilities in many&#xD;
      of the survivors. As with every medical condition, patient outcomes depend on the complex&#xD;
      interaction of the disease process, the medical and surgical interventions to treat the&#xD;
      disease, and the inherent capacity of the patient to respond to both the disease and its&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients with severe cardiac defects, the greatest risk for morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      occurs during and shortly after their neonatal surgical repair. During surgery to repair&#xD;
      severe cardiac defects, the body is cooled and the heart is stopped. In many cases, blood&#xD;
      flow to the vital organs is interrupted or restricted for a significant period of time while&#xD;
      the aortic arch is reconstructed. This process places profound stress on the patient's&#xD;
      capacity to tolerate these insults without sustaining irreversible injury to tissues such as&#xD;
      the heart, brain, and kidneys. That there is such a wide range of outcomes after this&#xD;
      surgery, even between patients with similar clinical features, suggests that there are&#xD;
      important individual differences in patients' abilities to respond to this stress that is&#xD;
      determined by differences in their genetic traits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The importance of the interaction between the controlled trauma of the surgical environment&#xD;
      and a patient's genetic background in determining patient outcomes has led to the new&#xD;
      discipline of &quot;peri-operative genomics.&quot; In this study, we will examine the contribution of&#xD;
      gene-environment interactions to perioperative and short-term outcomes in neonates with&#xD;
      severe congenital cardiac defects.&#xD;
