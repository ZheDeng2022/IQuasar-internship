    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to study the effectiveness of teaching teens and young women&#xD;
      with Phenylketonuria (PKU) or Maple Syrup Urine Disease (MSUD) about their disease and&#xD;
      nutrition related issues in a camp environment. It will also look at pregnancy outcome&#xD;
      results in women with PKU who attended Metabolic Camp and compare their results to other&#xD;
      women with PKU who have not attended the Metabolic Camp.&#xD;

      Metabolic Camp is an educational and social support program with research opportunities that&#xD;
      was developed in 1995 by Rani H. Singh, PhD, RD for females age 11 through adult with&#xD;
      phenylketonuria (PKU) and maple syrup urine disease (MSUD), two inherited metabolic disorders&#xD;
      (IMD). Camp provides a supportive environment for adolescent girls and women to learn about&#xD;
      the importance of nutrition and diet self-management, with the intention of arresting the&#xD;
      disease process and minimizing the instances of miscarriages and severe birth defects, which&#xD;
      are high in this population. After 20+ years, Metabolic Camp is established as a unique,&#xD;
      national program allowing up to 35 campers to live and learn during a week of nutritional&#xD;
      support and productive activities, while simultaneously providing researchers an opportunity&#xD;
      to gather important data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of Metabolic Camp are 1) to implement education curriculum and support activities as&#xD;
      an intervention program for females with PKU and MSUD, 2) to evaluate knowledge of disease&#xD;
      and dietary management, dietary treatment compliance, quality of life, and reproductive&#xD;
      choice issues and assess change in outcomes post-Camp, 3) to gather data through the&#xD;
      implementation of a research protocol during baseline and post-Camp each year, and 4) to&#xD;
      provide clinical and research training in IMD for professionals, from dietitians to medical&#xD;
      students. Campers must complete an informed consent process, should they decide to&#xD;
      participate in research activities. All campers submit a three-day food record and blood&#xD;
      samples to measure plasma amino acids on the first and last day of camp, both of which are&#xD;
      not classified as research activities, but rather standard of care for their disorder.&#xD;
      Additional studies such as indirect calorimetry, bone health markers, anthropometric markers,&#xD;
      nutritional status, mental and emotional wellbeing, neurocognitive functioning, access to&#xD;
      disease specific care, metabolomic profiling, gut microbiota, and blood and urine analysis,&#xD;
      have been and may continue to be assessed in those who participate in research pre and&#xD;
      post-Camp. These are novel investigations for the study of IMD and essential to understand&#xD;
      the physiological effects of Camp.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In over 20 years of Metabolic Camp, the following data have been collected: health history&#xD;
      and demographics, anthropometrics, dietary intake, compliance with medically prescribed diet,&#xD;
      quality of life, physical activity, plasma amino acids, select blood and urine biomarkers,&#xD;
      and bone density. Data are stored in REDCap, allowing evaluation of short- and long-term&#xD;
      outcomes on the life course of females with PKU and MSUD. Each year, phenylalanine&#xD;
      (Phe)/leucine (Leu) blood concentrations of campers decrease over the one week camp period,&#xD;
      demonstrating better metabolic control and compliance with diet. Campers' knowledge of&#xD;
      disease etiology, management, and effects, including Maternal PKU Syndrome (MPKU) are&#xD;
      improved. Social support networks are strengthened by meeting peers with the same or similar&#xD;
      disorder. The study protocol includes a comprehensive assessment of blood and urine&#xD;
      biomarkers to examine PKU from a much broader approach compared to the traditional&#xD;
      measurement of a single biomarker to assess patient status. Beneficial to campers and&#xD;
      clinicians alike, Metabolic Camp is an invaluable experience to gain insight, knowledge, and&#xD;
      stimulate new ideas related to research and optimal patient care.&#xD;
