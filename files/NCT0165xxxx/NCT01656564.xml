      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Long-term survival with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is not well understood.&#xD;
      Adults who were infected with HIV as children have lived with the virus for many years.&#xD;
      However, the effect of HIV on this group of people has not been studied in depth. Researchers&#xD;
      are interested in studying how HIV infection and the medicines used to treat it affect people&#xD;
      who were infected early in life. They want to find out if there are any problems with how&#xD;
      HIV-infected children grow and develop as adults, especially if they have developed heart&#xD;
      problems. As part of this study, people with HIV will be compared with healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study the effect of HIV infection and treatment on people who acquired HIV infection in&#xD;
      early life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals at least 18 years of age who acquired HIV infection in early life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy volunteers at least 18 years of age without HIV will serve as controls&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will have&#xD;
           regular study visits about once a year for up to 10 years to collect health information.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urine samples will be collected to look at kidney and liver function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  X-ray scans will be used to look at bone density and the amount of fat and muscle in the&#xD;
           body.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment will not be provided as part of this study.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has altered the natural history of HIV disease in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Long-term survivors of pediatric HIV infection offer a tremendous opportunity to&#xD;
           understand the effects of HIV and ART health outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A thorough understanding of the impact of HIV and ART on these long-term processes is&#xD;
           extremely relevant as ART programs for HIV-infected children expand globally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To explore the clinical outcomes and the impact of HIV infection and ART on a cohort with&#xD;
      HIV infection acquired in early life&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals at least 18 years of age who acquired HIV infection in early life&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy volunteers without HIV (greater than or equal to 18 years of age) will serve as&#xD;
           controls&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Annual evaluations of health status, immune function and other health parameters related to&#xD;
      HIV infection will be conducted.&#xD;
