    <textblock>
      Increasing exposure to a single orosensory cue without ingestion of additional energy may&#xD;
      promote an increased rate of habituation, more rapid satiation, and reduced intake. This&#xD;
      exposure can occur via smell (olfactory) and taste (gustatory) systems.It is not clear if&#xD;
      repeated exposure via the combined olfactory and gustatory systems increases the rate of&#xD;
      habituation more so than repeated exposure through one of these systems. Thus, the purpose of&#xD;
      this investigation is to examine the amount of salivation occurring in 12 trials of exposure&#xD;
      to a food via the olfactory, gustatory, and combined olfactory and gustatory systems. The&#xD;
      primary dependent variable will be the amount of salivation in the 12 trials. It is&#xD;
      hypothesized that a more rapid decrease in salivation will occur across trials in the&#xD;
      combined olfactory and gustatory exposure as compared to the other two conditions, indicating&#xD;
      a more rapid rate of habituation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately two of every three adults in the U.S. are overweight or obese. The high&#xD;
      prevalence of overweight/obesity negatively affects the health of the population, as obese&#xD;
      individuals are at increased risk for developing several chronic diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Successful control of body weight depends on effectively regulating eating. Satiation, the&#xD;
      process by which an eating bout ends, assists with eating regulation, and factors that&#xD;
      quicken the onset of satiation may aid with decreasing intake. One factor believed to&#xD;
      influence satiation is the rate of decrease in consummatory response (habituation) to&#xD;
      repeated presentations of food orosensory cues. Habituation is a basic form of learning, in&#xD;
      which behavioral and physiological responses decrease in response to repeated presentations&#xD;
      of a stimulus, with the decrease in response unrelated to sensory adaptation/fatigue or motor&#xD;
      fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In one condition, participants will smell lemon and lime across 12 trials (olfactory&#xD;
      exposure), in another condition participants will taste the juices across 12 trials&#xD;
      (gustatory exposure), and in the last condition participants will smell and taste the juices&#xD;
      across 12 trials (olfactory + gustatory exposure). The primary dependent variable will be the&#xD;
      amount of salivation in the 12 trials. It is hypothesized that a more rapid decrease in&#xD;
      salivation will occur across trials in the combined olfactory and gustatory exposure as&#xD;
      compared to the other two conditions, indicating a more rapid rate of habituation&#xD;
