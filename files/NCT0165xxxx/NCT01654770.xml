      Overt obscure gastrointestinal bleeding (OGIB) is a distinct clinical entity with&#xD;
      significantly worse outcomes compared with colonic bleeding and upper GI bleeding. The&#xD;
      mortality rate for patients with acute small bowel bleeding was 10%.1 Recently, a&#xD;
      meta-analysis of 10 studies showed that VCE and DBE have an equivalent diagnosis yields in&#xD;
      patients with obscure GIB (62% for VCE and 56% for DBE).2 The limitation of this&#xD;
      meta-analysis study was that the included studies examined patients with occult OGIB and&#xD;
      overt OGIB. Comparing with occult OGIB, patients with overt OGIB are more likely to present a&#xD;
      significant lesion that causes a recurrent bleeding which subsequently increases risk of&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality.3 According to emergency endoscopy concept from upper and lower GIB,&#xD;
      patients with overt OGIB have been demonstrated the usefulness of urgent VCE and urgent DBE&#xD;
      in a diagnosis tool with an impact on clinical management.4-7 Although previous studies&#xD;
      showed promising data about the use of urgent enteroscopy, the debate about using VCE or DBE&#xD;
      first in patients with massive overt OGIB is still uncertain. Thus in this study, we&#xD;
      conducted the prospective study to compare urgent VCE with urgent DBE in patients with&#xD;
      massive overt OGIB.&#xD;

      first in patients with massive overt OGIB is still uncertain. Thus in this study, we&#xD;
      conducted the prospective study to compare urgent VCE with urgent DBE in patients with&#xD;
      massive overt OGIB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective The objective of this study was to compare the diagnostic yield between urgent VCE&#xD;
      and urgent DBE in patients with massive overt OGIB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and Methods Patients Between October 2010 and March 2012, patients referred to a&#xD;
      tertiary, King Memorial Chulalongkorn University Hospital to evaluate GIB. The consecutive&#xD;
      patients with massive overt OGIB defined as a visible gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) (eg,&#xD;
      melena or hemotochezia) of unknown origin that persists after an initial negative&#xD;
      esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and colonoscopy were recruited. Massive was defined as the&#xD;
      need for at least 3 units of blood transfusion. All patients underwent an EGD and colonoscopy&#xD;
      within the first 48 hrs of hospitalization. In case that the causes of gastrointestinal&#xD;
      bleeding had not been identified, informed consent was obtained from all enrolled patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria were pregnancy, patients with a suspected intestinal obstruction or&#xD;
      stricture, cardiac pacemaker implantation or other electromedical device implantation,&#xD;
      diabetic gastroparesis, a history of gastrectomy and small bowel surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was a prospective study comparing between urgent VCE and urgent DBE. VCE and DBE&#xD;
      were performed within the first 72 hrs of hospitalization. VCE was carried out 12 hrs before&#xD;
      DBE. The independent operators performed VCE and DBE. The VCE results were blinded to the DBE&#xD;
      endoscopists. A positive finding was considered that finding could explain the cause of&#xD;
      bleeding and/or resulted in a correct therapeutic management including taking biopsy&#xD;
      sampling. A negative finding was considered when the cause of bleeding was not detected and&#xD;
      there was no recurrence of bleeding during the follow up period. The results of CE and DBE&#xD;
      were evaluated whether or not the total small bowel was visualization. The diagnosis yield&#xD;
      and the impact on clinical outcome were assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CE procedure CE was performed at the bedside according to the manufacturer's instruction&#xD;
      (MiroCam, Intromedic Co., Seoul, Republic of Korea). The technical description of CE has been&#xD;
      documented.8 The capsule has a complementary metal oxide semiconductor sensor with an image&#xD;
      acquisition rate of 3 frames per second. As a result of a power saving measure, the recorder&#xD;
      incorporates two external electrodes and a single skin electrode for electric data conduction&#xD;
      across the body which avoids the need for radiofrequency transmission.8 Patients ingested 2L&#xD;
      of polyethylene glycol (PEG) for small bowel preparation. Patients were allowed to drink&#xD;
      clear liquid at 2 hrs after swallowing the capsule. No any medication (prokinetic drugs,&#xD;
      simethicone) was given during the examination. The small bowel transit time was defined as&#xD;
      the time between the passage of the capsule through the pylorus and the arrival of the&#xD;
      capsule in the cecum. The boundary between the jejunum and ileum was defined as the half-time&#xD;
      of small bowel transit. 9 The positive finding on VCE were defined as either the&#xD;
      visualization of a lesion including angioectasia, mass and ulcer or the presence of blood&#xD;
      and/or blood clots in the small bowel lumen. The terms of negative findings were defined as&#xD;
      no abnormalities or non-specific findings such as red spots, erosion and visible submucosal&#xD;
      vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DBE procedure The standard DBE system (Fujinon Inc, Saitama, Japan) was used in the&#xD;
      examination. The system consists of the high resolution endoscope (Fujinon EN-450T5/20) with&#xD;
      a 200-cm working length, 8.5 mm of outer diameter and a 145-cm flexible overtube with 12 mm&#xD;
      of outer diameter. The endoscope's working channel has a 2.2 mm in diameter. Two latex&#xD;
      balloons were attached at the tips of both the enteroscope and the overtube and were inflated&#xD;
      and deflated with the air from a pressure controlled system. The technique has been described&#xD;
      in the detail previously by Yamamoto et al.10 The initial oral approach was usually selected.&#xD;
      Whilst, the anal approach was performed initially in patients suspected ileum lesion who&#xD;
      presented with hematochezia. The anal approach was performed in the same session when the&#xD;
      initial route was negative. In case that the other approach was considered, the small bowel&#xD;
      mucosa was marked by submucosal India ink injection using injection catheter at the most&#xD;
      distal part during the oral approach and the most proximal part during the anal approach. DBE&#xD;
      was performed under conscious sedation with midazolam and/or meperidine administration and&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory monitoring by the experience endoscopists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the bleeding cause was detected, the endoscopic treatment was used to achieve hemostasis&#xD;
      including argon plasma coagulation (APC), injection or clipping. Biopsy was taken whenever&#xD;
      possible. In case that tumor was found, India ink was marked into submucosa around it.&#xD;
