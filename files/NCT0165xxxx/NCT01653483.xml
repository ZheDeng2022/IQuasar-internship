    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, repeat dose, 2-period, incomplete&#xD;
      block, crossover, safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) study to evaluate 3 once-daily doses of&#xD;
      umeclidinium (GSK573719; UMEC) in adolescent asthma subjects aged 12 through 17 years,) who&#xD;
      are currently using asthma medications that do not contain inhaled corticosteroids (non-ICS).&#xD;
      The objectives are to investigate safety and tolerability, and PK after a 7-day (+2) repeat&#xD;
      once-daily dose of UMEC (15.6, 62.5, and 250 mcg) in asthmatic adolescent subjects. Safety&#xD;
      endpoints will include reported adverse events, vital signs, ECGs, clinical laboratory tests,&#xD;
      and rescue albuterol use. The PK endpoints will include serial PK (plasma and urine)&#xD;
      concentrations and derived parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty four subjects will be randomized to participate in the study for up to 7 weeks&#xD;
      (including: an initial screening visit, a 7 to 14-day run-in, and 2 treatment periods each of&#xD;
      7 (+2) day duration, with a washout period of 7-14 days between treatment periods). There&#xD;
      will be a Follow-up Visit approximately one week after the end of the second treatment&#xD;
      period. Subjects will refrain from using rescue medication for 4 hours prior to any clinic&#xD;
      visits, unless for emergency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each treatment period, study medication will be taken once in the morning until the&#xD;
      morning of Day 7 (+2 days) when subjects will return to the clinic for study assessments and&#xD;
      take the last dose of study medication. On Day 7 (+2), subjects will remain in the clinic&#xD;
      overnight for serial assessments (ECG, and PK plasma and urine samples over the 24-hours).&#xD;
