    <textblock>
      A multicenter, non-randomized, placebo-controlled, single dosing schedule, subject-blinded&#xD;
      study to evaluate the effect of GSK1120212 on the electrical activity of the heart as&#xD;
      compared to placebo in subjects with solid tumor cancers. All subjects will undergo Screening&#xD;
      assessments within 21 days prior to the start of the study treatment to determine their&#xD;
      eligibility for enrollment in the study. Eligible subjects will receive study treatment&#xD;
      administered over a period of 15 days followed by a post-treatment follow-up visit. Study&#xD;
      treatment (GSK1120212-matched placebo) will be blinded to subjects. Subjects will receive&#xD;
      GSK1120212-matched placebo on one day during the first 14 days of dosing. On all other days&#xD;
      the subject will receive a once-daily 2 mg dose of GSK1120212 except for Day 15 when the&#xD;
      subject will receive 3mg dose of GSK1120212 12-lead ECG recordings will be obtained from&#xD;
      continuous ECG recordings obtained via a 12-lead Holter monitor on Study Days 1 and 15 while&#xD;
      subjects are in the clinical research unit. The effect of GSK1120212 on the electrical&#xD;
      activity of the heart will be determined by time-matched ECGs obtained at the same time&#xD;
      points relative to dosing on these days. Ambulatory blood pressure readings will be obtained&#xD;
      from continuous 24-hour recordings via an ambulatory blood pressure monitor The effect of&#xD;
      GSK1120212 on blood pressure parameters will be determined by blood pressure readings&#xD;
      obtained at the same time points relative to dosing on Study Days 1 and 15. Serial blood&#xD;
      samples to analyze the concentration of study drug in the subject's blood will be obtained at&#xD;
      the same time points relative to dosing on Study Days 1 and 15. Subjects who are eligible for&#xD;
      continued treatment with GSK1120212 may continue treatment under the rollover study MEK114375&#xD;
      (drug study number). A post-treatment follow-up visit will be conducted within 28 days of the&#xD;
      last dose of study treatment for all subjects who do not continue treatment in the rollover&#xD;
      study MEK114375.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      GSK1120212 is an orally administered, potent and highly selective small molecule inhibitor of&#xD;
      MEK1(mitogen-activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1)/MEK2 (mitogen-activated&#xD;
      extracellular signal-regulated kinase-2) activation and kinase activity. As monotherapy,&#xD;
      GSK1120212 has shown an acceptable risk-benefit profile with encouraging efficacy in various&#xD;
      oncologic settings. This Phase I, single-sequence, placebo-controlled, singleblind,&#xD;
      multicenter study is designed to evaluate the effects of repeat oral dosing of GSK1120212 on&#xD;
      electrocardiographic parameters with a particular focus on its effect on cardiac&#xD;
      repolarization (Corrected QT interval [QTc] duration) as compared to placebo in subjects with&#xD;
      solid tumor cancers. A single dose of placebo will be administered on Study Day 1 followed by&#xD;
      administration of a once-daily 2 mg dose of GSK1120212 for 13 days (Study Days 2 through 14)&#xD;
      and on Study Day 15 a dose of 3 mg of GSK1120212 will be given. Digital 12-lead&#xD;
      electrocardiograms (ECGs) will be extracted from continuous ECG recordings obtained via&#xD;
      Holter monitor on Study Days 1 and 2 after the administration of placebo and on Study Days 15&#xD;
      and 16 after the administration of GSK1120212. Pharmacokinetic samples will be time-matched&#xD;
      with the Holter ECGs. This study will also assess the exposure-QTc relationship between&#xD;
      plasma concentrations of GSK1120212 and its effect, if any, on cardiac repolarization,&#xD;
      specifically on the QTc interval. Continuous 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring&#xD;
      will be conducted to assess the effect of GSK1120212 on blood pressure parameters on Study&#xD;
      Days 1 and 15. Safety assessments, including assessment of adverse events, clinical&#xD;
      laboratory tests (hematology and clinical chemistry) and vital signs, will be performed&#xD;
      throughout the study. Following completion of study treatment, eligible subjects may&#xD;
      transition to the open-label, rollover study MEK114375 to continue treatment with GSK1120212.&#xD;

             be acceptable in case of subjects receiving therapeutic anticoagulants such as&#xD;
             warfarin as long as INR is monitored during the study according to clinical practice;&#xD;
             Calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault formula; If LLN is not defined for a given&#xD;
             institution, then ejection fraction must be greater than and equal to 50%. NOTE:&#xD;
             Subjects with aspartate aminotransferase (AST), ALT or bilirubin values outside the&#xD;
             range(s) in the table due to Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones are not&#xD;
             excluded. Laboratory results obtained during Screening should be used to determine&#xD;
             eligibility criteria. In situations where laboratory results are outside the permitted&#xD;
             range, the investigator may opt to retest the subject and the subsequent within-range&#xD;
             screening result may be used to confirm eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have serum potassium, serum magnesium, and total serum calcium levels within normal&#xD;
             limits. NOTE: If total serum calcium is below the LLN, then it will be necessary to&#xD;
             determine the albumin-corrected total serum calcium level. Use the following&#xD;
             calculation: Calcium (mg/dL) = measured total Calcium (mg/dL) + 0.8 (4.0 - serum&#xD;
             albumin [g/dL]) NOTE: If serum potassium or magnesium level is below the LLN,&#xD;
             supplementation is permitted in order to meet the inclusion criterion. Subject should&#xD;
             be retested following supplementation. In order to avoid a situation where the subject&#xD;
             cannot be dosed during the study due to electrolyte levels falling below the LLN, it&#xD;
             is strongly recommended to maintain serum potassium levels greater than 4&#xD;
             mEq(Milliequivalent )/L and serum magnesium levels greater than 2.2 mg/dL whenever&#xD;
             possible. Slight elevations of potassium or magnesium above the upper limit of normal&#xD;
             may be seen during supplementation and will not exclude subjects from study entry.&#xD;
