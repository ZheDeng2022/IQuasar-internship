      Phase I part&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary Objective: To determine the recommended dose of the combination of lapatinib&#xD;
           with Lipo-Dox as first line chemotherapy in patients with ErbB2 positive metastatic&#xD;
           breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary Objectives:To define the safety profile; To observe the response rate and&#xD;
           progression free survival&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II part&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary Objective :To determined the objective response rate of the combination of&#xD;
           lapatinib with Lipo-Dox as first line chemotherapy in patients with ErbB2 positive&#xD;
           metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;
