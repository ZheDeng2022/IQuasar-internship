    <textblock>
      The aim of the present project is to develop and evaluate a novel and brief method of&#xD;
      generalizing habituation (i.e., calming down after being upset) from an original learning&#xD;
      context in the laboratory to other contexts inside and outside the laboratory. Specifically,&#xD;
      the primary aim of this project is to evaluate whether novel habituation reminders (HRs)&#xD;
      introduced following personally-relevant emotional stressors reduce acute negative emotions&#xD;
      and psychological distress outside of an original learning context. Using a team of basic and&#xD;
      applied scientists, over 4 years the investigators expect to screen 420 adult outpatients to&#xD;
      enroll 250 study participants who have extreme difficulties with emotion regulation. These&#xD;
      250 participants will be randomly assigned to one of eight experimental groups, with the&#xD;
      experimental design leading them through 1 or 2 of 3 project experiments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Actual enrollment: 372 adult outpatients signed consent and enrolled into the study. 222&#xD;
      participants were eligible and began the study. Out of the 222, 210 completed the study (as&#xD;
      opposed to the desired 250).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experiment 1 will evaluate whether novel auditory HRs following personally-relevant emotional&#xD;
      stressors differentially reduce psychological distress and negative emotions (via self-report&#xD;
      and psychophysiology), compared to no HRs, within the same and different lab contexts after a&#xD;
      1 week delay. Experiment 2 will evaluate whether HRs differentially reduce negative emotions,&#xD;
      psychological distress, difficulties with emotion regulation, and psychiatric symptoms,&#xD;
      compared to sham sounds outside the laboratory across a 1 week period, using 8x daily&#xD;
      assessments of distress and emotions and automated HRs/shams when acute negative emotions are&#xD;
      present. An automated server and cellular phone system will be used to assess distress and&#xD;
      emotional states and to deliver HRs/shams. Experiment 3 will examine the feasibility,&#xD;
      acceptability, and preliminary effect size estimates when participants self-initiate the use&#xD;
      of HRs in their daily lives across a 2 week period when acute negative emotions are present.&#xD;
      The specific randomization rules across the 8 groups are explained in detail in the full&#xD;
      protocol .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks in this study may arise from 1) the assessment interviews and questionnaires, and 2)&#xD;
      discussing and hearing self-reported distressing events. Initial analyses will focus on the&#xD;
      success of randomization to groups. The investigators will examine group differences on&#xD;
      possible covariates (e.g., demographic variables) and those that are different across&#xD;
      conditions will be used as covariates. Preliminary analyses will examine distributional&#xD;
      properties of primary outcome measures and correlations among outcome measures and possible&#xD;
      covariates. The investigators will set alpha at .05 for all analyses of primary hypotheses.&#xD;
      To examine the influence of psychiatric symptoms (compared to the HR) on primary outcomes,&#xD;
      the investigators will examine the relationship between baseline clinically relevant&#xD;
      psychiatric variables (e.g., symptom severity) and changes in SUDS, emotional arousal, and&#xD;
      clinical outcomes over time and if appropriate include these variables in primary analyses.&#xD;
      Full data analytic plans are described in the full protocol.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Difficulties regulating emotional arousal in a skillful manner are common across many&#xD;
      psychiatric disorders and may be central to some of the most severe and difficult-to-treat&#xD;
      populations (e.g., borderline personality disorder). To immediately decrease negative affect,&#xD;
      individuals who have difficulties regulating negative emotions often rely on maladaptive&#xD;
      behaviors that are significant public health problems, including substance use, suicidal&#xD;
      behavior, binging/purging, and other negatively reinforced behavior. Conventional approaches&#xD;
      to generalization of emotion regulation skills outside the clinic (e.g., assigning therapy&#xD;
      homework) are insufficient. New interventions are needed that directly and immediately reduce&#xD;
      acute negative emotions and do not rely on patient compliance with homework assignments or&#xD;
      other top-down approaches. Accordingly, the primary aim of this project is to evaluate&#xD;
      whether novel habituation reminders (HRs) introduced following personally-relevant emotional&#xD;
      stressors reduce acute negative emotions and psychological distress outside of an original&#xD;
      learning context. Using a team of basic and applied scientists, over 4 years investigators&#xD;
      will recruit 420 adult outpatients to enroll 250 participants who have extreme difficulties&#xD;
      with emotion regulation to participate in 3 experiments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Actual enrollment: 372 adult outpatients signed consent and enrolled into the study. 222&#xD;
      participants were eligible and began the study. Out of the 222, 210 completed the study (as&#xD;
      opposed to the desired 250).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before being recruited into the study, potential participants will complete a phone screen-a&#xD;
      pre-experiment screening questionnaire or an online questionnaire to assess certain exclusion&#xD;
      and inclusion criteria. Eligible participants will be invited to the study office to provide&#xD;
      written informed consent and receive a clinical assessment, during which full inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the method developed by Pitman and colleagues and used in studies of adults with PTSD,&#xD;
      BPD, and other diagnoses, investigators will create four negative emotional arousal scripts&#xD;
      that will be used in a random order during Exp. 1. In brief, the Clinical Assessor will ask&#xD;
      the participant to describe five of the most recent (i.e., past two weeks) moderate stressors&#xD;
      in their lives. Participants will write a description of each event, and the clinical&#xD;
      assessor will work with the participant to establish a clear story for each event that can be&#xD;
      recited in approximately 30 seconds. The assessor will then review the script, ask for any&#xD;
      clarification, and then ask the participant to rank them from most to least stressful.&#xD;
      Following the assessment, the clinical assessor or same sex experimenter will digitally&#xD;
      record these scripts into .mp3 files, which will be used in random order as the emotional&#xD;
      stressors in Exp. 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experiment 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Design-In Exp. 1, the investigators will use a 2 (Learning Phase: HR v. No HR) X 2 (Testing&#xD;
      Phase: Context same v. different) X 2 (Testing Phase: HR v. No HR) between-subjects factorial&#xD;
      design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization-All participants will be randomized to condition, with oversampling for HR&#xD;
      groups, by using an urn randomization procedure by the off-site study statistician. Urn&#xD;
      randomization will be conducted using age and gender as matching variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Learning Phase (Day 1)Baseline-First, baseline subjective units of general psychological&#xD;
      distress (SUDS; visual analogue scale from 0-100) and emotional arousal will be assessed&#xD;
      using self-reported and psychophysiological (galvanic skin response) measures. The Study&#xD;
      Coordinator will affix electrodes using standard procedures, and will use Biopac MP150&#xD;
      hardware and AcKnowledge software for data acquisition. The galvanic skin response device is&#xD;
      not being tested for safety or efficacy in this study, and is not being used as a diagnostic&#xD;
      device. Participants will complete a five-minute baseline, sitting in a comfortable chair&#xD;
      quietly without sleeping in a temperature controlled, sound attenuated room. SUDS and&#xD;
      self-reported baseline emotion (SAM) will be obtained at the end of baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Next, the emotional stressor task will be administered to all participants by playing a&#xD;
      stressful script which was created during the clinical assessment. Prior to hearing the&#xD;
      script, participants will be instructed to listen carefully and to attempt to imagine the&#xD;
      event as vividly as possible. The task proceeds as follows: (1) the stressor will be heard&#xD;
      via headphones (30s), (2) participants are instructed via standardized instructions to&#xD;
      imagine as vividly as possible the stressful experience (30s), (3) silence (30s), (3)&#xD;
      self-report of emotional arousal and valence (SAM; 30s) will be obtained via a computer. This&#xD;
      sequence will repeat a minimum of two and a maximum of four times, until habituation has&#xD;
      occurred (return to mean baseline arousal). Habituation will be continuously monitored using&#xD;
      a real-time monitoring program currently being used in the lab that samples arousal (GSR)&#xD;
      every 500ms relative to the average baseline arousal. This method allows idiographic analyses&#xD;
      of habituation to the stressor, and ensures that the HR is administered during habituation.&#xD;
      Individuals who continue to have high levels of emotional arousal after completing the&#xD;
      emotional stressor task will be asked to sit in silence for 10 more minutes (receiving the&#xD;
      SAM every 120 seconds), and if habituation has yet to occur, they will be prompted to focus&#xD;
      on their breath to help with relaxation for the next 10 minutes. Based on findings using this&#xD;
      emotional stressor task suggesting that habituation occurs within 3 minutes for veterans with&#xD;
      PTSD, the investigators are confident that the approach will result in habituation. Once&#xD;
      habituation occurs, the HR will be heard via headphones 3 times (for a total of 6s) by&#xD;
      participants randomized to hear the HR, whereas the No-HR participants will hear nothing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HR will be a series of neutral novel sounds lasting 6s, and will be the same series of&#xD;
      sounds being used in current lab ongoing studies testing extinction reminders. After the HR&#xD;
      is played, the Study Coordinator will use standardized instructions to tell participants to&#xD;
      remember this sound as a reminder of calming down. Lastly, SUDS and self-reported emotional&#xD;
      arousal measure will be assessed (SAM). Physiological data will be continuously measured&#xD;
      throughout this period. Although it is not expected to occur frequently, data from&#xD;
      participants who do not habituate will not be used in analyses, and additional participants&#xD;
      run. After completing the stressor task, there will be a 15 minute break, followed by a&#xD;
      second and third administration of the stressor task using the procedures outlined above, but&#xD;
      with a different personalized stressor recording each time. Investigators will randomize the&#xD;
      order of the recordings that the participants described during the clinical assessment. At&#xD;
      the end of the third emotional stressor task, participants will be scheduled for their&#xD;
      Testing Phase one week later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testing Phase (Day 2)-One week after the Learning Phase, participants will complete the&#xD;
      Testing Phase for Exp. 1. Upon arrival, half of the participants will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      be tested in the original laboratory room from the Learning Phase (same room as Day 1) and&#xD;
      the other half to a new room. In line with the investigators' previous learning studies using&#xD;
      context manipulations, the new room in the Testing Phase will represent a very different&#xD;
      context compared to the room from the Learning Phase. The novel testing room will have&#xD;
      different size, lighting, and furniture. Using a scent machine, the novel room will have the&#xD;
      smell of mint released during testing. In addition, to ensure that the experimenter does not&#xD;
      function as a reminder of habituation from the Learning Phase, testing in the novel room will&#xD;
      be done by a different experimenter than in the original Learning Phase. In both the original&#xD;
      and novel testing rooms, the Testing Phase will begin with a baseline (same procedures as&#xD;
      above). Next, a new recording of a personally relevant stressor will be played (same&#xD;
      procedures as in Learning Phase). Participants in both rooms will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      hear the HR or hear nothing (No HR). The HR will be presented through headphones every 10&#xD;
      seconds after the onset of the stressor task. Measures of psychological distress and&#xD;
      emotional arousal will be obtained (same procedures as in the Learning Phase). As in the&#xD;
      Learning Phase, after 10 minutes or when habituation occurs as operationalized above, the&#xD;
      stressor will end and self-reported psychological distress and emotional arousal will be&#xD;
      assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experiment 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      -In both the original and novel testing rooms, the Testing Phase will begin with a baseline&#xD;
      (same procedures as above). Next, a new recording of a personally relevant stressor will be&#xD;
      played (same procedures as in Learning Phase). Participants in both rooms will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to hear the HR or hear nothing (No HR). The HR will be presented through headphones&#xD;
      every 10 seconds after the onset of the stressor task. Measures of psychological distress and&#xD;
      emotional arousal will be obtained (same procedures as in the Learning Phase). As in the&#xD;
      Learning Phase, after 10 minutes or when habituation occurs as operationalized above, the&#xD;
      stressor will end and self-reported psychological distress and emotional arousal will be&#xD;
      assessed. Because groups 5 and 7 from Exp. 1 will have only heard the HR during the Testing&#xD;
      Phase, and it may therefore be associated with the emotional stressor but not habituation,&#xD;
      these participants will not be randomized into Exp. 2. The participants in Exp. 2 will be&#xD;
      randomized to either hear the HR or a sham sound delivered via the automated server and&#xD;
      cellular phone platform when negative emotions are endorsed. The result is a 2 (Day 1 HR v.&#xD;
      No HR) X 2 (Phone HR v. sham sound) Latin square experimental design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure. At the conclusion of Exp. 1, the Clinical Assessor will orient participants to&#xD;
      Exp. 2. Over the next week, participants receive eight calls each day (approximately one call&#xD;
      every two waking hours), with each call lasting 1-2 minutes. For both experimental conditions&#xD;
      (HR v. Sham), calls on the first day will be used to establish baseline levels of&#xD;
      psychological distress (SUDS; 0-9), emotional valence (positive vs. negative; 1-9 scale;&#xD;
      endpoints from the SAM used) and strength of emotional arousal (1-9; SAM), while no HRs will&#xD;
      be delivered. On all other days, when participants report high emotional arousal (i.e., &gt;4)&#xD;
      and low valence (i.e., negative affect; &lt;5), they will automatically hear the HR or sham&#xD;
      sound based on randomization to Exp. 2 condition. The sham sound will be a series of neutral&#xD;
      percussive sounds unrelated to the HR in form but equivalent on other relevant parameters&#xD;
      (e.g., amplitude, length). After the HR or sham sound, all participants will provide&#xD;
      self-reported psychological distress (SUDS) and emotional valence/arousal, in order to&#xD;
      evaluate differential changes due to the HR or sham sound. After one week, participants will&#xD;
      return to the laboratory to return the phone, receive compensation, and be debriefed. To&#xD;
      further evaluate clinically meaningful changes due to the HR, the experimenter will collect&#xD;
      pre-, and post-Exp. 2 assessments of symptoms of clinical outcome measures (e.g., symptoms of&#xD;
      anxiety and depression When beginning Exp. 2, information will be given on how to use the&#xD;
      phone (with hands-free headset), keep its battery charged, and how to call study staff.&#xD;
      Phones will be restricted to study-related access and emergency numbers only. All calls will&#xD;
      be conducted using a dedicated server and existing software in the lab. The software uses&#xD;
      automated dialing and recorded prompts that ask participants to provide ratings on the phone&#xD;
      keypad.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, to mitigate the possibility that the phone will be stolen, sold, or not used, the&#xD;
      Study Coordinator and participants will create a plan to use the phone. Second, self-report&#xD;
      scales will be the same as those from Exp. 1. Third, calls will be during times that the&#xD;
      patient will normally be awake. No participant identifying information will be accessible in&#xD;
      the cell phone. All data from the phone are stored in real-time in a password-protected&#xD;
      computer in the lab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experiment 3&#xD;
&#xD;
      -The primary aim of Exp. 3 is to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary&#xD;
      effect size estimates of a self-initiated HR (n = 50. on psychological distress and acute&#xD;
      negative emotions by hearing the HRs over two weeks. Investigators will examine: (1)&#xD;
      frequency of calls in to hear the HR within and across participants at times in their daily&#xD;
      life when they are having acute negative emotions, and (2) how laboratory HR training affects&#xD;
      psychological distress and emotional arousal/valence in naturalistic settings over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures. At the conclusion of Exp. 1, the Clinical Assessor will orient participants to&#xD;
      Exp. 3. Participants will be asked to call the automated server during the next two weeks&#xD;
      when they are feeling acute negative emotions. To facilitate use of the HR, the assessor will&#xD;
      discuss expected upcoming stressful events, in particular those that occur daily or&#xD;
      frequently, and explain how the phone can be used to cope with these stressful or emotionally&#xD;
      arousing situations. Participants will also be told that they will receive three automated&#xD;
      calls a day, beginning the next day. During the 2 week period, participants calling in to the&#xD;
      lab will hear a brief greeting and an assessment of present SUDS, emotional arousal and&#xD;
      valence. If the participant indicates emotional arousal &gt;4 and valence &lt; 5, the automated&#xD;
      system will ask if they would like to hear the HR. If the participant does not meet these&#xD;
      requirements or indicates that they do not want to hear the HR, they will instead hear a&#xD;
      brief message thanking them for calling in. After the HR or thank you message, all&#xD;
      participants will then be again asked to report SUDS, emotional arousal and valence, after&#xD;
      which the call will end. The procedure for calls out will be identical to Exp. 2, except that&#xD;
      all participants will receive 3 calls a day, have access to the HRs, and be able to choose&#xD;
      whether to hear the HR. After two weeks, participants will return to the lab, give back the&#xD;
      cell phone, complete an exit interview, and receive compensation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exp. 3 compliance enhancement strategies are the same as in Exp. 2, except for the incentive&#xD;
      structure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interviews-Diagnostic exclusions and current/past prevalence of Axis I and II diagnoses will&#xD;
      be determined by the Structured Clinical Interview for Mental Disorders-I and II.&#xD;
      Intelligence Quotient (IQ) will be assessed with the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-Third&#xD;
      Edition (PPVT-III). The Treatment History Interview (THI)will be used to assess previous and&#xD;
      ongoing psychiatric services received. The THI will be administered at pre- and&#xD;
      post-experiment time points. All interviews will be videotaped, and investigators will&#xD;
      determine the reliability of every tenth interview. Exit interviews will be conducted at the&#xD;
      end of Exp. 3 to assess participants' acceptability of the HR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physiological Measurement-Skin conductance will be measured using Ag-AgCl electrodes on the&#xD;
      middle phalanx of the middle and ring fingers of the participant's non-dominant hand. The&#xD;
      electrodes will be connected to a Biopac MP150 device in an adjacent room. Amplified signals&#xD;
      of analog data are converted to digital form and filtered using Biopac's AcKnowledge&#xD;
      Software, and are stored in a database on the computer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biochemical measures-Urinalyses (UA's) are conducted at diagnostic intake to rule out&#xD;
      participants currently taking illicit or prescription substances known to affect&#xD;
      psychophysiological arousal. The specimens will be screened on-site using the Biosite Triage&#xD;
      Meter Plus.. Urine will be tested for cocaine, marijuana, opiates, methadone, amphetamines,&#xD;
      barbiturates, and benzodiazepines. Results will be available within 30 minutes.&#xD;
