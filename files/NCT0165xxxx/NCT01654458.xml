  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a high prevalence of sexual and body image problems among women treated for&#xD;
      gynecologic cancer, which can lead to considerable distress. Given the sensitive and highly&#xD;
      personal nature of these problems, women are often reluctant to speak to their doctors about&#xD;
      these concerns and have few resources for support and information. The research team will&#xD;
      conduct a prospective randomized controlled trail (RCT) to test the benefits of &quot;GyneGals,&quot; a&#xD;
      12-week online (i.e. Internet-based) support group intervention for women who are sexually&#xD;
      distressed due to gynecologic cancer and its treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this study is to determine whether a professionally-facilitated,&#xD;
      information-rich, online support group is beneficial for women who are sexually distressed&#xD;
      due to gynecologic cancer and the side effects of treatment.&#xD;
