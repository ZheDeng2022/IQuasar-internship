      We have developed an innovative optical molecular imaging platform (called PRODIGI) based on&#xD;
      high-resolution fluorescence and white-light technologies in a hand-held, real-time,&#xD;
      high-resolution, non-invasive format. PRODIGI offers a non-contact means of obtaining&#xD;
      instantaneous image-based measurements of diagnostically-relevant biological and molecular&#xD;
      information of a wound and surrounding skin tissues for the first time and could have&#xD;
      significant impact on improving conventional wound care, management, and guidance of&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that real-time imaging of tissue autofluorescence signals&#xD;
      emanating from endogenous connective tissue (e.g. collagen) and pathogenic bacteria within&#xD;
      complex wounds can be used to determine healing status (i.e., collagen re-modeling and wound&#xD;
      closure), detect wound bacterial contamination and/or infection that is occult under standard&#xD;
      clinical white light evaluation, and guide intervention during wound care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have recently developed an innovative optical molecular imaging platform&#xD;
      (called PRODIGI) based on high-resolution fluorescence and white-light technologies in a&#xD;
      hand-held, real-time, high-resolution, non-invasive format. PRODIGI offers a non-contact&#xD;
      means of obtaining instantaneous image-based measurements of diagnostically-relevant&#xD;
      biological and molecular information of a wound and surrounding skin tissues for the first&#xD;
      time and could have significant impact on improving conventional wound care, management, and&#xD;
      guidance of intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In preliminary preclinical testing, the investigators have discovered that when wounds are&#xD;
      illuminated by violet/blue light, endogenous collagen in the connective tissue matrix emit a&#xD;
      characteristic green fluorescent signal, while most pathogenic bacterial species emit a&#xD;
      unique red fluorescence signal due to the production of endogenous porphyrins. Therefore,&#xD;
      with autofluorescence imaging, no exogenous contrast agents are needed during imaging, making&#xD;
      this approach particularly appealing as a diagnostic imaging method for clinical use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on extensive preclinical studies in our labs, PRODIGI has demonstrated its capability&#xD;
      at collecting autofluorescence images of wounds and detecting the presence and relative&#xD;
      changes in connective tissue (e.g. collagen) content and bio-distribution involved in wound&#xD;
      healing. It can also detect the presence and relative amounts of commensal and pathogenic&#xD;
      bacteria within the wound based on autofluorescence alone (these bacteria are invisible to&#xD;
      standard visualization with the naked eye using white light), thus providing a measure of&#xD;
      infection status. This could significantly impact clinical wound care and management by i)&#xD;
      reducing the complications associated with missed detection of bacterial infection under&#xD;
      conventional practice, ii) facilitating image-guided wound sampling by targeted&#xD;
      swabbing/biopsy and iii) monitoring wound healing and treatment response over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous Related Studies: A pilot-level clinical study (UHN REB protocol # 09-0015-A, PI:&#xD;
      DaCosta, 50 patients imaged to date) performed by our group from 2008-2011 to assess the&#xD;
      clinical utility of the device successfully demonstrated that tissue autofluorescence&#xD;
      produced by endogenous collagen/elastin in the skin appears green in the fluorescent images,&#xD;
      while most clinically-relevant bacterial colonies present in the wound produce a red&#xD;
      fluorescence signal caused by endogenous porphyrins. Some bacterial species (e.g. pseudomonas&#xD;
      aeruginosa) produce a green fluorescence signal that can be differentiated spectrally and&#xD;
      texturally from the fluorescence of the dermis (another hue of green, discernable by our&#xD;
      proprietary image analysis software). The PRODIGI device is sensitive enough to detect these&#xD;
      green and red fluorescence signals from tissue and bacteria confirming the utility of this&#xD;
      compact and portable imaging platform for clinical wound care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that real-time imaging of tissue autofluorescence signals&#xD;
      emanating from endogenous connective tissue (e.g. collagen) and pathogenic bacteria within&#xD;
      complex wounds can be used to determine healing status (i.e., collagen re-modeling and wound&#xD;
      closure), detect wound bacterial contamination and/or infection that is occult under standard&#xD;
      clinical white light evaluation, and guide intervention during wound care.&#xD;

        The study will be conducted at the Judy Dan Research and Treatment Centre in Toronto.&#xD;
        Patients of the JDRTC typically present with diabetic foot ulcers. Eighty new patients with&#xD;
        wounds will be entered into this trial, based on statistical power-based calculations for&#xD;
        sample size determined in collaboration with the UHN Biostatistics Group (assuming one&#xD;
        wound per patient).&#xD;
