      The primary objective of this study is to investigate the safety and tolerability following&#xD;
      administration of single ascending doses of GCC4401C in healthy male subjects; and the&#xD;
      secondary objective of this study is to characterize the single-dose PK profile after oral&#xD;
      administration of GCC-4401C, and to determine an appropriate dose range and dosing regimen of&#xD;
      oral GCC-4401C for subsequent clinical trials.&#xD;
