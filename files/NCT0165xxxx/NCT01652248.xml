    <textblock>
      Patients with pacemakers often have undiagnosed heart muscle weakness. When a pacemaker&#xD;
      battery has run down, it is easily replaced by a short procedure. In those with heart muscle&#xD;
      weakness, who use their pacemaker most of the time (rather than acting just as a back-up) the&#xD;
      investigators want to find out if adding a further lead to their pacemaker system improves&#xD;
      their heart's function, kidney function and exercise capacity.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Chronic heart failure Chronic heart failure (CHF) is a common syndrome of breathlessness&#xD;
           and fatigue associated with left ventricular systolic dysfunction. It affects 2% of&#xD;
           individuals between 50 and 60 years of age, and increases in prevalence to 10% over the&#xD;
           age of 80 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Cardiac resynchronisation therapy Cardiac resynchronisation therapy (CRT) involves the&#xD;
           implantation of a pacemaker capable of stimulating the heart (specifically the left&#xD;
           ventricle) from both the front of the heart, the right ventricle RV (as is usual with&#xD;
           conventional pacemakers) and from the back of the heart (known as the lateral wall) via&#xD;
           the coronary sinus, aiming to improve the timing of cardiac contraction (dyssynchrony)&#xD;
           and hence the pumping function of the heart in order to improve symptoms of&#xD;
           breathlessness and fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Early data in patients with left bundle branch block and severe heart failure, suggested&#xD;
           improved exercise capacity and left ventricular function. More recent data have&#xD;
           demonstrated not only improved symptoms, but also reduced hospital admissions, and&#xD;
           improved overall mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Current guidelines drawn up using the data from randomised trials, suggest that CRT&#xD;
           should be offered to patients with left bundle branch block with a QRS &gt; 150ms and&#xD;
           severe (class III and IV) heart failure despite optimal medical therapy. Patients with a&#xD;
           QRS duration of between 120 and 150ms should be assessed for mechanical dyssynchrony&#xD;
           before being offered a device.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Heart failure in the pacemaker population&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Prevalence In 307 patients with pacemakers, 94 (31%) had left ventricular ejection&#xD;
                fraction (LVEF) &lt; 40% and 83 (27%) had symptoms of heart failure. RV pacing is&#xD;
                associated with an increase in heart failure-related hospitalisation and mortality,&#xD;
                and in patients with left ventricular dysfunction the presence of a right&#xD;
                ventricular apical pacemaker is a strong predictor of future deterioration in left&#xD;
                ventricular function.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Aetiology of pacemaker-related heart failure Many patients receiving RV pacemakers&#xD;
                are elderly with a background of ischaemic heart disease or hypertension, both of&#xD;
                which contribute to the development of heart failure. In addition RV pacing induces&#xD;
                dyssynchrony, no different to that of left bundle branch block (LBBB). Dyssynchrony&#xD;
                leads to altered regional blood flow and wall stress. The severity of these&#xD;
                perfusion abnormalities, the regional wall motion abnormalities and the associated&#xD;
                deterioration in global left ventricular function are directly related to the&#xD;
                duration of pacing. These changes can be identified after only 18 months of pacing.&#xD;
                The induction of dyssynchrony by RV apical pacing seems therefore to lead to&#xD;
                adverse LV remodeling, LV dilatation, asymmetrical hypertrophy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Management of pacemaker-related heart failure In any one patient the exact&#xD;
                aetiology of a deterioration of LV dysfunction is often unclear. What has become&#xD;
                routine practice however, is an attempt to avoid RV pacing unless absolutely&#xD;
                necessary and several programmes within commercially available devices now exist to&#xD;
                facilitate this. The options in patients with a high degree of heart block on the&#xD;
                other hand remain limited to aggressive medical therapy with beta-blockers and&#xD;
                angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The effects of upgrading conventional pacemaker systems to those capable of delivering&#xD;
           resynchronisation therapy have been incompletely investigated. There have only been&#xD;
           retrospective series examining the impact of upgrading conventional pacemakers to CRT&#xD;
           systems. Early data demonstrated the safety of adapting standard pacemakers to provide&#xD;
           biventricular stimulation and suggested improvements in LV function. One study,&#xD;
           involving 20 patients with chronic atrial fibrillation and AV nodal ablation, showed&#xD;
           that adding an LV lead was associated with improved LV systolic function, reduced&#xD;
           hospitalisations and improved quality of life. Other reports examining the impact of CRT&#xD;
           in patients with chronic RV pacing on acute echocardiographic variables of LV systolic&#xD;
           function and reductions in electromechanical delay and beneficial haemodynamic effects&#xD;
           of biventricular pacing in 15 and 20 patients with pre-existing RV pacemakers. More&#xD;
           recently a cross-over study of 44 patients requiring generator replacement demonstrated&#xD;
           improved symptoms and LV function with 3 months of CRT when compared with 3 months of RV&#xD;
           pacing. There are also data from small series demonstrating improvements of&#xD;
           echocardiographic strain variables (in 12 patients) and symptoms in patients with&#xD;
           significant CHF upgraded from conventional pacemakers to CRT systems&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Aim of this study We propose to randomise 50 patients with ventricular dysfunction&#xD;
           listed for pulse generator replacement to receive either a standard right ventricular&#xD;
           generator replacement, or to be upgraded to a resynchronisation device. These patients&#xD;
           will then be reassessed at six months to establish the effects of this policy on left&#xD;
           ventricular function and exercise capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental design&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients All patients will have undergone an echocardiogram, exercise test and renal&#xD;
           function check as part of the survey of all patients undergoing pacemaker battery change&#xD;
           at Leeds General Infirmary. If reducing or avoiding RV pacing to below 80% is not&#xD;
           possible, patients with LV dysfunction (LVEF &lt; 50%) will be invited to participate in&#xD;
           the randomised controlled trial of standard generator replacement or upgrade to CRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Procedures Patients will then be randomised to receive either an upgraded system or a&#xD;
           pacemaker generator replacement as standard. Following the implant, subjects will be&#xD;
           seen at 6 weeks and three months in the pacemaker clinic as is usual. The 6 monthly&#xD;
           visit will include repeat echocardiography, an exercise test with metabolic gas&#xD;
           exchange, repeat blood tests, 24 hour urine collection and symptom assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Devices Patients will either receive a standard pacemaker appropriate to their&#xD;
                pacing indication, but with the capacity of keeping RV pacing to a minimum if&#xD;
                possible, or will be implanted with an LV lead and a generator capable of providing&#xD;
                resynchronisation pacing.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Risk of the implant procedure From large registries, left ventricular lead&#xD;
                implantation is successful in 92% and the procedure is safe with fewer than 8%&#xD;
                requiring re-operation and around 10% complication rate. In our experience of &gt; 100&#xD;
                upgrades for severe symptomatic heart failure, we have had no deaths, one&#xD;
                re-operation for an initial failure to place the LV lead, and no infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients with atrial fibrillation The presence of atrial fibrillation reduces the&#xD;
                benefit from CRT in randomised controlled trials. However, registries continue to&#xD;
                demonstrate similar overall benefits on symptoms and left ventricular function and&#xD;
                hospitalisation for both groups, albeit with no improvement in the rate of&#xD;
                maintenance of sinus rhythm following CRT. Recent data have suggested that patients&#xD;
                with AV node ablation and atrial fibrillation, have a similar symptomatic response&#xD;
                rate as patients in sinus rhythm whereas those without AV node ablation do not&#xD;
                benefit. It is therefore postulated that the benefits of CRT are dependant upon a&#xD;
                high percentage of resynchronisation pacing (&gt; 90%) and that patients with atrial&#xD;
                fibrillation with an intact AV node fail to respond because of intermittent&#xD;
                intrinsic conduction. In the present investigation however, our patients will be&#xD;
                have demonstrated dependency upon ventricular pacing for rate support. We will&#xD;
                therefore include patients with atrial fibrillation in our study, albeit with a&#xD;
                stratified randomisation to ensure they are equally distributed between the upgrade&#xD;
                and standard generator change arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Endpoints The primary endpoint will be an improvement in left ventricular function as&#xD;
           measured by left by echocardiography. Secondary endpoints will include changes in&#xD;
           exercise capacity, renal function and quality of life score.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Power calculations&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Left ventricular function Previous short term studies provide some guide as to the&#xD;
                potential benefit of upgrading RV pacing systems to CRT. In patients with important&#xD;
                heart failure a population of 20 patients crossed over at three months demonstrated&#xD;
                an improvement in exercise capacity of 1.5ml.kg.min-1 from 12.5 (2.9)ml.kg.min-1 to&#xD;
                14 (3.0)ml.kg.min-1. There was also an improvement in LVEF from 26.1(8)% to&#xD;
                34.8(9)% and a reduction in BNP from 2405pmol.l-1 (not normally distributed) to&#xD;
                1667pmol.l-1. Each of these changes was significant to less than the 0.02 level.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Exercise capacity Although patients randomised into the present proposal will have&#xD;
                better baseline exercise capacity and less severe ventricular dysfunction than&#xD;
                patients recruited to previous studies of CRT, we will avoid the potential&#xD;
                disadvantage of cross-over, and will follow them up for longer. We therefore expect&#xD;
                similar magnitudes of benefit (5% improvement in LV function and 1.5 ml.kg.min¬-1).&#xD;
                We estimate an LV lead implant failure rate of around 8%, and a loss to follow up&#xD;
                of 5%. Hence we estimate that to identify a significant difference with a power of&#xD;
                90% between RV pacing and CRT after six months that we need to recruit 50 patients&#xD;
                (25 to each arm). Results will be analysed on an intention to treat basis.&#xD;
