  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, paralleled-group, active-controlled study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is to demonstrate non-inferiority of the Granisetron Transdermal Delivery System&#xD;
      (GTDS) efficacy compared with the ondansetron efficacy with regard to Complete Response (CR)&#xD;
      of Chemotherapy Induced Nausea and Vomiting (CINV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients scheduled to receive the one cycle of a HE chemotherapy regimen administered for 1-5&#xD;
      days will attend a Screening Visit 2 to 14 days before start of HE chemotherapy. Eligible&#xD;
      patients will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment groups at the Randomization Visit (1 to 2&#xD;
      days prior to HE chemotherapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sancuso patch&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Zofran inj. + Zofran tab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patch will be applied 2days (48-24h) prior to first daily dose of the highly emetogenic&#xD;
      chemotherapy regimen and remain in place for 5 days after start of chemotherapy. The patient&#xD;
      will be assessed daily until 5days after first chemotherapy administration. Adverse Events&#xD;
      (AEs) will be collected until 2 days after the final dose of IP. Non-serious AEs will be&#xD;
      followed-up until 2 days after the final dose of IP. Serious adverse events will be&#xD;
      followed-up until they are resolved, stable or until the patient is lost to follow-up.&#xD;
