      The objective of this randomized phase II open label trial is to determine the anti-tumor&#xD;
      activity of TAK-700 (Orteronel) as compared to bicalutamide in terms of clinical&#xD;
      progression-free survival in prostate cancer patients who failed 1st line treatment with LHRH&#xD;
      (luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone) agonists or surgical castration.&#xD;
