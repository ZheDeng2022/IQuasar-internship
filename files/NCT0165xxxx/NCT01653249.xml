    <textblock>
      This study will consist of 300 women aged 18-50 years. The study will show that a new&#xD;
      therapeutic human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine designed to regress a precancerous condition&#xD;
      called high-grade squamous intraepithelial neoplasia (HSIL)is safe. HPV is known to cause&#xD;
      cervical, vaginal, oral, and anal cancers. This novel vaccine will consist of a synthetically&#xD;
      made fragment of HPV protein called E6 and yeast extract called Candin®. Previous studies&#xD;
      have revealed that immune response to E6 is important in fighting HPV. We also know that&#xD;
      injecting Candin has anti-HPV effect since it has been used to treat common warts which are&#xD;
      caused by different types of HPV. The current standard treatment for HSIL is loop electrical&#xD;
      excision procedure (LEEP). The immune system is the part of the body that fights infection&#xD;
      and cancer. This research study will also examine the immune response to the vaccine and its&#xD;
      effectiveness in regressing HSIL. Volunteers would be eligible to enroll in the study if they&#xD;
      have had a recent Papanicolaou (Pap) smear result indicating HSIL or &quot;Cannot rule out HSIL&quot;,&#xD;
      and if they meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Subjects will be eligible to receive&#xD;
      vaccinations if biopsy confirms HSIL. A series of four vaccinations will be given roughly 3&#xD;
      weeks apart, and LEEP will be performed at the end of the study approximately 12 weeks after&#xD;
      the last vaccination.&#xD;
