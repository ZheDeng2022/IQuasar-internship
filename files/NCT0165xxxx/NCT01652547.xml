  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the preliminary safety, pharmacokinetics, and anti-tumor activity of&#xD;
      pasireotide s.c. in patients with metastatic melanoma or metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma.&#xD;
      The study consists of three phases: screening, intra-patient dose-escalation, and follow-up&#xD;
      phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the screening phase patient will be informed of all aspects of the study and sign informed&#xD;
      consent forms and then be screened for study eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the intra-patient dose escalation phase, 18 patients will be treated with pasireotide&#xD;
      s.c. 300 μg t.i.d. for 2 weeks. If there are no unacceptable AEs, defined as drug-related&#xD;
      clinically meaningful, uncontrolled grade 3 or any grade 4 toxicities, patients will be dose&#xD;
      escalated to 600 μg t.i.d. for 2 more weeks, then 900 μg t.i.d. for 2 weeks and then 1200 μg&#xD;
      for 2 weeks provided that there are no unacceptable AEs. Each patient will be in the dose&#xD;
      escalation phase for a maximum of 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At end of the intra-patient dose escalation phase, patients will be allowed to switch to 80&#xD;
      mg pasireotide LAR i.m. q 28 d (or a lower dose in case of toxicity) for an additional 6&#xD;
      months or until disease progression, or unacceptable AEs, or patient withdraws consent. In&#xD;
      addition, all patients will keep their pasireotide s.c. t.i.d. treatment (same dose as that&#xD;
      at the end of the 8-week dose escalation phase) during the first 2 weeks of the LAR follow-up&#xD;
      phase, except on the day receiving the first LAR dose because of an anticipated initial burst&#xD;
      of drug release.&#xD;
