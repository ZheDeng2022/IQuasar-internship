  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is looking at the effects of Panobinostat, an investigational treatment, on cancer&#xD;
      cells in patients who have Hodgkin lymphoma (a cancer of the immune system with specific&#xD;
      Hodgkin/Reed Sternberg Cells), T-cell lymphoma (a cancer of the immune system with too many T&#xD;
      lymphocytes), chronic lymphocytic leukemia or prolymphocytic leukaemia (immune system with&#xD;
      too many lymphocytes in the blood stream), lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (immune system with too&#xD;
      many plasma cells or B lymphocytes) or myeloma (a cancer of plasma cells).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Panobinostat is a new drug which has led to disease improvement in some patients with Hodgkin&#xD;
      lymphoma, certain types of T-cell lymphoma, myeloma and some B cell lymphomas. Not all&#xD;
      patients benefit from panobinostat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers wish to look at the effects of panobinostat on cancer cells. The aim of this&#xD;
      project is find out which patients or diseases are likely to respond to treatment with&#xD;
      panobinostat in the future and to see if there are particular features of the patient or of&#xD;
      the cancer that affects the likelihood of the way individuals respond to panobinostat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Panobinostat is an oral medication (taken by mouth) that effects the way cancer cells and in&#xD;
      normal cells make proteins. Panobinostat has been used in several clinical trials around the&#xD;
      world. The largest trials generally have fewer than 200 patients and are in Hodgkin lymphoma,&#xD;
      cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, and myeloma where between one in five and one in three patients&#xD;
      have significant improvement in their disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will look at samples of tumour before treatment and during treatment. This will&#xD;
      be one of the first studies to look at how cancer cells change following treatment with this&#xD;
      drug. It is unusual because it requires repeated biopsies of the participant's tumour.&#xD;
      Panobinostat is considered an experimental (or investigational) drug and not approved by any&#xD;
      regulatory authority (such as the Food and Drug Administration, FDA in the USA or by the&#xD;
      Therapeutics Goods and Administration, TGA, in Australia) to treat any type of cancer.&#xD;
      Therefore, Panobinostat is not approved to treat patients who have been diagnosed with&#xD;
      refractory or relapsed cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 30 patients with one of the diseases listed above will be enrolled at Peter&#xD;
      MacCallum Cancer Centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected it will take about 2 to 3 years to recruit 30 patients and that on average&#xD;
      patients will take part for six to eighteen months. This time could be shorter or longer&#xD;
      depending on how well the treatment works in each individual. While the trial will take up to&#xD;
      4 years to complete, the science studies may take longer.&#xD;
