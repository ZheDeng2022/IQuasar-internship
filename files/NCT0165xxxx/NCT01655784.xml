  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is being conducted in order to compare angiographic outcomes in patients receiving&#xD;
      0.014-0.0155&quot; platinum framing and filling coils (larger diameter coils) versus those treated&#xD;
      solely with coils less than 0.014&quot; (with a standard diameter).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Angiographic occlusion at follow-up imaging will be more frequent in patients&#xD;
      receiving 0.014-0.0155&quot; platinum coils during embolization compared to those receiving&#xD;
      smaller-diameter coils.&#xD;

      Primary Study Objective: Occlusion rate: angiographic occlusion, improvement or no change in&#xD;
      the post-coiling appearance of the aneurysm as judged by an independent core lab on follow-up&#xD;
      angiography at 12-18 months after endovascular embolization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Treatment related morbidity and mortality, as measured by the NIH stroke scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Packing density as measured by volumetric filling of the aneurysm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Clinical outcome at 3-6 and 12-18 months post-coiling, as measured by the modified&#xD;
           Rankin scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Re-hemorrhage and re-treatment rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: FEAT will be a prospective, randomized trial comparing the utilization of&#xD;
      0.014-0.0155&quot; coils versus smaller diameter coils in mid-sized aneurysm treatment. The&#xD;
      0.014-0.0155&quot; bare platinum coils (Stryker, Natick, MA) are FDA-approved and in common use at&#xD;
      institutions in this country and across the world. Patients will be enrolled who meet the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria and consent to participate. Patients will be randomly assigned by a&#xD;
      central web-based system in a 1:1 manner to either the framing coil treatment or the&#xD;
      non-framing coil treatment. Data on each patient will be collected at the time of enrollment&#xD;
      and treatment, and at first and second follow-up visits.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient presenting with ruptured or unruptured cerebral aneurysm appropriate for&#xD;
             endovascular treatment as determined by the neurovascular treating team&#xD;
             (neurointerventionist and/or neurosurgeon).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The neurointerventionist feels that the aneurysm can be safely treated with either&#xD;
             using, or not using, a 0.015-0.0155&quot; platinum coil.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients are 18-80 years of age (inclusive).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patient must be Hunt and Hess grade 0 to 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patient has given fully informed consent to endovascular coiling procedure. If the&#xD;
             patient cannot consent for themselves, appropriate written consent has been sought&#xD;
             from their next of kin or appropriate power of attorney.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Aneurysm 6-14 mm in maximum diameter.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patient is willing and able to return for clinical evaluation and follow-up imaging&#xD;
             evaluation (angiography or MRA) at 3-6 months and 12-18 months after endovascular&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. The patient has not been previously randomized into this trial or another related&#xD;
             ongoing trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. The aneurysm has not been previously treated by coiling or clipping.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient has more than one aneurysm requiring treatment in the current treatment&#xD;
             session, and only one of those to be treated aneurysms fits the FEAT inclusion&#xD;
             criteria (ie - if either (1) a patient has multiple aneurysms, but only one will be&#xD;
             treated at enrollment; or (2) if two or more aneurysms are treated during the current&#xD;
             treatment session and BOTH are able to be enrolled, then they remain eligible for the&#xD;
             trial). Non-treated additional aneurysms may be treated at a later date with any coil&#xD;
             type that the operator chooses).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Target aneurysm has had previous coil treatment or has been surgically clipped.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Hunt and Hess score is 4 or 5 after subarachnoid hemorrhage.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Inability to obtain informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Medical or surgical co-morbidity such that the patient's life expectancy is less than&#xD;
             2 years.&#xD;
