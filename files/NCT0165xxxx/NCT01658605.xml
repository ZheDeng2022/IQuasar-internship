  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK1605786 is an oral antagonist specific for the chemokine receptor CCR9 in development for&#xD;
      treatment of small bowel and colonic Crohn's disease (CD). The purpose of this Phase II proof&#xD;
      of concept study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of GSK1605786 (500 mg twice daily)&#xD;
      administered orally for 16 weeks for the treatment of patients with active ulcerative colitis&#xD;
      (UC). A key secondary objective is to understand the mechanism by which GSK1605786 is acting&#xD;
      and to this end samples will be collected to confirm the degree of inhibition of CCR9 on T&#xD;
      lymphocytes in the blood of patients, and to explore the relationship between concentration&#xD;
      of drug and changes in lymphocyte and antigen presenting cell populations in the peripheral&#xD;
      circulation and in the colon. Patients recruited at specified investigational sites will be&#xD;
      invited to participate in an optional sub-study to explore the effects of GSK1605786 on&#xD;
      trafficking of technetium labelled T cells using Single Photon Emission Computerized&#xD;
      Tomography (SPECT). Specifically, the technique will be used to follow trafficking to large&#xD;
      intestine and thymus and findings linked to pharmacokinetics of GSK1605786, receptor&#xD;
      occupancy and clinical efficacy outcomes&#xD;
