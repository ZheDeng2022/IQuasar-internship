  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this research is to assess visual function and optical performance of&#xD;
      CE marked, implanted intraocular lenses to understand the individual factors that affect&#xD;
      their performance and how these may be improved in future designs and to evaluate measurement&#xD;
      techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All outcome measures will be captured 3-6 months after surgery&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A cataract occurs when the natural lens of the eye, which plays a major role in the focusing&#xD;
      of light and production of sharp visual images, becomes cloudy and hardens, resulting in a&#xD;
      loss of visual function. Left untreated, cataracts can cause preventable blindness. During&#xD;
      cataract surgery the natural lens is removed and a man-made intraocular lens (IOL) is&#xD;
      implanted in its place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IOL technology has advanced significantly in recent years and as a result the main goal of&#xD;
      cataract surgery is no longer simply the successful removal of the cloudy lens and&#xD;
      restoration of vision. Providing patients with the best possible refractive outcome and the&#xD;
      best possible visual quality is now much more important when assessing surgery outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aspheric, multifocal and accommodating IOLs are among the new designs developed to improve&#xD;
      visual outcome after cataract surgery. In order to assess the effectiveness of these designs,&#xD;
      visual function needs to be evaluated both objectively and subjectively following their&#xD;
      implantation. Such evaluation allows the continued evolution of these IOL designs towards&#xD;
      optimum. This proposed research study, which aims to assess the visual function and optical&#xD;
      performance of new CE marked IOLs after implantation, could significantly contribute to the&#xD;
      enhancement and development of improved IOL designs in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have successfully conducted similar patient trials for the past 5 years. As new IOL&#xD;
      designs are constantly being developed, approved and CE marked, this type of research study&#xD;
      will always have the potential to offer new information that is not currently available and&#xD;
      has not previously been assessed or published and could contribute towards improved IOL&#xD;
      designs in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All outcome measures will be captured 3-6 months after surgery&#xD;
