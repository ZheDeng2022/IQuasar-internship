  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cocoa flavanols form part of the family of chemicals (also found in red wine and tea) which&#xD;
      have aroused interest due to population studies suggesting that diets high in these&#xD;
      substances might reduce risks of heart disease. In the laboratory, these flavanols have been&#xD;
      shown to cause blood vessels to widen and blood flow to increase. As dysfunction in this&#xD;
      ability of blood vessels to widen is now thought to play a central role in the complications&#xD;
      of diabetes, novel ways to mitigate this are constantly being sought.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study aims to use non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to measure foot&#xD;
      and brain blood flow before and after 7 days consumption of a cocoa drink high in flavanols,&#xD;
      in subjects with diabetes, with and without peripheral neuropathy.&#xD;

      Cocoa flavanols form part of the family of polyphenols (also found in red wine and tea) which&#xD;
      have aroused interest due to epidemiological studies suggesting that diets high in these&#xD;
      substances might reduce risks of heart disease. However, it is difficult to account for all&#xD;
      sources of polyphenols in these epidemiological studies, and the level of cocoa product&#xD;
      consumption was generally not well documented. Furthermore, in readily available cocoa&#xD;
      products, processing may remove most of the flavanols, leading to such products varying&#xD;
      considerably in flavanol content. Recently, laboratory studies of the effects of cocoa&#xD;
      flavanols have suggested an effect on the relaxation of smooth muscle in blood vessel walls,&#xD;
      specifically the element mediated by the endothelium (blood vessel wall). Studies using&#xD;
      ultrasound methods in healthy volunteers have shown an increase in blood flow in the arm&#xD;
      following temporary arterial occlusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As endothelial dysfunction is now thought to play a central role in the complications of&#xD;
      diabetes, novel ways to mitigate this are constantly being sought. It is well recognised that&#xD;
      diabetic peripheral nerve damage leads to abnormal foot blood flow, including impaired&#xD;
      superficial skin blood flow, and that this is one of the factors delaying wound healing in&#xD;
      diabetic foot ulcers (the single largest cost in secondary care diabetes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several techniques are currently used to monitor blood flow to the limbs, including venous&#xD;
      occlusion plethysmography (VOP), laser Doppler methods and nuclear medicine techniques. These&#xD;
      techniques have low spatial resolution, low specificity, are labour intensive, or require the&#xD;
      use of injected radioactive contrast agents (which pose a particular risk to diabetic&#xD;
      patients). Radiation dose also limits repeat studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The arterial spin labelling magnetic resonance (ASL MR) technique is non-invasive, but yields&#xD;
      a quantifiable measure of blood flow with high resolution, and allows measurements to be&#xD;
      repeated several times, as the technique uses no external contrast agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study aims to use non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to measure&#xD;
      peripheral (foot) and brain blood flow at baseline and in response to a cocoa drink high in&#xD;
      flavanols, in subjects with type 2 diabetes, with and without peripheral neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will attend an initial screening visit. Measures of HbA1c, kidney function and blood&#xD;
      pressure will be checked, along with ankle-brachial pressure index (to check for poor&#xD;
      circulation), foot pulses, and examination for peripheral nerve damage and cardiac&#xD;
      neuropathy.&#xD;
