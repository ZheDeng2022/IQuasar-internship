      Fibromyalgia is a common rheumatologic disorder. Many patients complain of cognitive&#xD;
      dysfunction as part of their symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to assess this cognitive dysfunction through extensive neuro-cognitive&#xD;
      testing.&#xD;

      Cognitive dysfunction in Fibromyalgia patients: specific neuro-psychological dysfunctions,&#xD;
      psychiatric comorbidity and integrative assessments - Can the investigators help them?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scientific and Technological Background&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. General Clinical characteristics FM is a common rheumatologic disorder (ranges from&#xD;
           2%-12% in the general population) with complex symptom presentation that include:&#xD;
           chronically painful, soft tissue pain. Those affected suffer widespread pain and&#xD;
           tenderness at anatomically defined tender points in soft tissue musculoskeletal&#xD;
           structures. Associated symptoms include depression, anxiety, fatigue, sleep&#xD;
           disturbances, and other somatic complaints (headaches, irritable bowel or bladder,&#xD;
           morning stiffness, dysesthesia) and severe cognitive impairment. Cognitive impairment in&#xD;
           FM has both subjective elements: &quot;forgetfulness&quot;, &quot;concentration difficulties&quot; or &quot;a&#xD;
           failing memory&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Cognitive impairment in FM 2.1 Subjective Cognitive impairment in FM The subjective&#xD;
           cognitive impairments have been described in several studies. Zachrisson and colleagues&#xD;
           reported a 95% incidence rate for ''Concentration Difficulties'' and a 93% incidence&#xD;
           rate for ''Failing Memory'' on their Fibro-Fatigue scale. Additionally, patients who&#xD;
           have FM report more cognitive problems and dissociative states than other rheumatology&#xD;
           patients. Arnold and colleagues reported the results of patient focus groups that&#xD;
           assessed important symptoms and the impact of these symptoms from a patient perspective.&#xD;
           Patients reported that memory and concentration problems were very disruptive-affecting&#xD;
           their ability to express themselves due to word-finding difficulties, their ability to&#xD;
           organize and plan ahead, their ability to respond quickly to questions, and their&#xD;
           ability to drive.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.2 Objective Cognitive impairment in FM Objective cognitive dysfunction is assessed&#xD;
           through a broad range of neuro-cognitive testing. The mechanisms found to have the most&#xD;
           marked impairment in FM are: working memory, followed by episodic memory and access to&#xD;
           semantic memory. In addition findings points to a particular difficulty in dealing with&#xD;
           distracting information so that patients have an enhanced sensitivity to distraction and&#xD;
           difficulty in filtering sensory stimuli.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.2.1 Working memory Working memory is a system of short-term memory storage system (on&#xD;
           the order of seconds) combined with other mental processes, that allows for example, to&#xD;
           briefly remember two numbers and add them together mentally. A quick assessment of&#xD;
           working memory function is: how many digits an individual can listen to and then repeat&#xD;
           in backward order. Working memory is a basic cognitive mechanism that underlies&#xD;
           successful performance on many other cognitive tasks. There are now several studies that&#xD;
           have reported impairment in this important cognitive function in subjects who have FM,&#xD;
           using a variety of different tests of working memory.&#xD;
&#xD;
           (A) Paced auditory serial attention test (PASAT): Most studies using the PASAT found&#xD;
           lower performance in subjects who have FM compared with controls although Suhr did not&#xD;
           find differences.&#xD;
&#xD;
           (B) Auditory Consonant Trigram (ACT) test: Both Leavitt and Katz and Dick and colleagues&#xD;
           found that subjects who have FM recalled fewer of the trigrams correctly, and many&#xD;
           performed in the impaired range compared with the control participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
           (C) Reading Span Task is a working memory test used extensively to study age-related&#xD;
           decline in working memory : Park and colleagues and Dick and colleagues found that&#xD;
           subjects who have FM perform more poorly than age-matched controls. Furthermore, Park&#xD;
           and colleagues found that performance in the subjects who have FM was not different from&#xD;
           control subjects who were 20 years older.&#xD;
&#xD;
           (D) Test of Everyday Attention (TEA) showed that subjects who have FM had lower scores&#xD;
           on the working memory component of the TEA.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The wide variety of working memory tests that demonstrate lower performance in FM is&#xD;
           striking, suggesting that this impairment is quite robust. Because deficits in working&#xD;
           memory ability have repercussive effects on other aspects of cognition, a small deficit&#xD;
           in working memory may have a large impact on performance on complex tasks. A busy work&#xD;
           environment requires an employee to hold some information in mind while using that&#xD;
           information for further processing.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.2.2 Episodic Memory&#xD;
&#xD;
           Episodic memory refers specifically to the ability to remember specific events or&#xD;
           episodes from one's life (Remembering your first day at school or the name of your&#xD;
           teacher). Several researchers have found deficits in episodic memory in subjects who&#xD;
           have FM using a wide variety of standardized neuro-psychological tests and some&#xD;
           laboratory tests. Several of these results are presented:&#xD;
&#xD;
           (A) Grace and colleagues found significant differences on the general memory, verbal&#xD;
           memory, and delayed recall components of the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised (WMS-R), but&#xD;
           not on the visual memory or attention/concentration components.&#xD;
&#xD;
           (B) Leavitt and Katz found that subjects who have FM, performed slightly below the norm&#xD;
           on logical memory and paired associates.&#xD;
&#xD;
           (C) Glass and colleagues found that subjects who have FM recalled fewer words in a list&#xD;
           learning task, and their memory was most impaired when combined with a distracting&#xD;
           secondary task at both list learning and recall.&#xD;
&#xD;
           These and other findings suggest a mild impairment in episodic memory in FM patients.&#xD;
           However, the results of episodic memory testing do not seem to be as robust as the&#xD;
           working memory results. In addition, Leavitt and Katz suggest that memory function in FM&#xD;
           may be strong enough to perform well under ideal conditions (neuro-cognitive testing),&#xD;
           but performance decrements may be observed in the presence of distraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.2.3 Semantic memory Semantic memory is the knowledge of words and facts that have been&#xD;
           learned, such as knowing that eggs and milk are sources of protein (21). It can be&#xD;
           measured in a number of ways. One method uses verbal fluency to measure how quickly and&#xD;
           efficiently stored knowledge about words can be accessed. Several studies indicate&#xD;
           impairment in verbal fluency in FM.&#xD;
&#xD;
           (A) Park and colleagues found that FM subjects produced fewer words during a fluency&#xD;
           test compared to age-matched controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
           (B) Landro and colleagues and Munguia-Izquierdo and Legaz-Arrese) also reported similar&#xD;
           findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
           (C) Suhr did not find any difference between subjects who have FM and controls on a&#xD;
           fluency test.&#xD;
&#xD;
           (D) Park and colleagues and Glass and colleagues also found that FM subjects perform&#xD;
           more poorly than education- matched controls on tests of vocabulary (another test of&#xD;
           semantic memory).&#xD;
&#xD;
           (E) Leavitt and Katz reported a naming speed deficit in FM, consistent with the verbal&#xD;
           fluency results.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Thus, patients who have FM seem to have a deficit in accessing stored knowledge. This&#xD;
           deficit can make it difficult for patients to think quickly and to come up with the&#xD;
           right word for a given situation. Several patients indicated this kind of word-finding&#xD;
           difficulty while interviewed in a patient focus group.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.2.4 Attention, concentration and executive functions Attention and working memory are&#xD;
           very closely linked because attention mechanisms are used to control the items that are&#xD;
           accessed, stored and processed in working memory. The working memory problems found in&#xD;
           FM patients may be due to the management of the contents of working memory, using&#xD;
           attention and concentration.&#xD;
&#xD;
           (A) Leavitt and Katz suggest that the cognitive impairment in FM patients is more&#xD;
           prominent on tasks where distraction from a competing source of information was&#xD;
           prominent (PASAT, ACT) in contrast to tasks without distraction (digit span, logical&#xD;
           memory, paired associate).&#xD;
&#xD;
           (B) Others found that distraction reduced memory abilities in FM subjects when attention&#xD;
           was divided during the learning.&#xD;
&#xD;
           (C) Dick and colleagues reported that FM subjects perform at a lower level than healthy&#xD;
           controls on the TEA test of attention.&#xD;
&#xD;
           (D) In a recent study performed by Verdejo-Garcia and colleagues, executive functions&#xD;
           and decision making were assessed in FM using the Wisconsin Card Sorting Task (WCST) and&#xD;
           the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT). FM subjects achieved a lower number of categories and made&#xD;
           more non-perseverative errors on the WCST. On the IGT, subjects who have FM showed an&#xD;
           altered learning curve that suggested a hypersensitivity to reward. These new data on&#xD;
           executive functions fit well with the attention control difficulties.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Dealing with distraction or controlling what is attended to, are particular problems in&#xD;
           FM and come under the category of executive functions. Planning a goal-directed behavior&#xD;
           and monitoring it are also under that category. Taken together, these results strongly&#xD;
           suggest that executive functions are impaired in FM patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Possible causes of cognitive dysfunction in FM&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.1 Other mental symptoms Mental symptoms such as depression and anxiety are suspected&#xD;
           to play an important role in the development of cognitive dysfunction in FM. Sephton et&#xD;
           al found depressive symptoms to be negatively correlated with verbal recall and Surh&#xD;
           found them to be related to memory. Grace et al reported an association between anxiety&#xD;
           and measures of memory and concentration. An important question was whether these&#xD;
           dysfunctions remained after correcting for depression and anxiety. Indeed, Dick et al&#xD;
           reported a significant difference between controls and FM patients even after correcting&#xD;
           for depression and anxiety. Park et al and Verdejo-Garcia et al did not find a&#xD;
           significant correlation between these mental symptoms and performance on cognitive&#xD;
           measures. In summary, depressive symptoms and anxiety can contribute to cognitive&#xD;
           dysfunction but they do not entirely explain it.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.2 Fatigue and sleep disturbances Impaired sleep is known to negatively affect&#xD;
           cognitive performance. Cote -Moldofsky and Suhr attempted to explain the possible&#xD;
           relationship between altered sleep architecture and cognitive performance. Suhr&#xD;
           specifically reported that fatigue was related to psychomotor speed. Dick et al reported&#xD;
           that the differences between control and FM patients remained even after controlling for&#xD;
           sleep disturbances. Thus, as is the case in mental symptoms, fatigue and sleep&#xD;
           disturbances can not fully explain the cognitive deficit in FM patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.3 Pain Chronic pain is known to negatively affect cognitive performance. Various&#xD;
           cognitive tasks including, impaired attention, impaired learning on a decision-making&#xD;
           task and an attentional bias to pain-related stimuli, were found in chronic pain patient&#xD;
           and in FM patients specifically. These patients were found to selectively attend to pain&#xD;
           words. In many studies of FM patients specifically, self-reported levels of pain were&#xD;
           associated with cognitive performance. These suggest that pain in itself may disrupt the&#xD;
           normal function of attention. As apposed to the case with depression, anxiety and sleep&#xD;
           disturbances, Dick et al, observed that the differences between controls and FM patients&#xD;
           cognitive functions disappeared when controlled for pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Recent experience in our psychiatric clinic Over the past few months the investigators&#xD;
           have been evaluating FM patients for cognitive dysfunction. Nearly 10 patients have&#xD;
           undergone the above mentioned extensive assessment. In our assessment the investigators&#xD;
           also added a more specific assessment of executive function; the &quot;six elements&quot; task.&#xD;
           This task directs participants to perform several tasks while under both a time&#xD;
           limitation and under specific rules. Thus, they are required to use: planning and&#xD;
           organization, initiation, and monitoring. These processes are usually not taken under&#xD;
           consideration during formal neuro-psychological tests because of their very structured&#xD;
           nature. Our preliminary findings suggest that fibromyalgia patients show a pattern of&#xD;
           executive dysfunction compared to the healthy population. The investigators hypothesize&#xD;
           a similar pattern will be found in our more extensive research and suggest that&#xD;
           significant executive dysfunction lie in the basis of cognitive dysfunction found in&#xD;
           fibromyalgia patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Cognitive rehabilitation - Treatment options Cognitive rehabilitation, a behavioral&#xD;
           treatment approach for individuals with cognitive dysfunction, is designed to reduce&#xD;
           functional impairment and increase engagement in daily adaptive activities; vocational,&#xD;
           social, and adaptive daily living skills. Originally developed to improve cognitive&#xD;
           functioning after traumatic brain injury (TBI), cognitive rehabilitation programs have&#xD;
           recently been adapted for other neurological conditions. Subsets of cognitive training&#xD;
           programs have been developed to target improvement in specific cognitive domains&#xD;
           including: attention, working memory, and executive functioning, which are all essential&#xD;
           cognitive skills to complete daily living tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For example, TBI patients' who underwent attention training, consisting of direct attention&#xD;
      and metacognitive training to promote development of compensatory and problem solving&#xD;
      strategies, showed improvement on complex attention measures. When it comes to mild memory&#xD;
      impairment, compensatory strategies are recommended. Adults with chronic TBI, who were&#xD;
      trained to use compensatory strategies for personally-relevant memory problems through&#xD;
      errorless learning or didactic strategy instruction, reported greater use of strategies after&#xD;
      training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metacognitive training (self monitoring and self regulation) for executive functions include&#xD;
      problem solving strategies with application to everyday activities. The awareness training&#xD;
      protocol incorporates feedback to increase participants' awareness of their abilities, with&#xD;
      experiential exercises requiring participants to predict, self-monitor, and self-evaluate&#xD;
      their performance. Improvement in awareness, performance of everyday tasks and overall&#xD;
      function were evident for both TBI and stroke patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive decline and executive dysfunction are also common among Parkinson's disease&#xD;
      patients. As in FM, executive dysfunction/attention and memory impairment are the most&#xD;
      prevalent deficits reported. A computerized cognitive rehabilitation program focused on&#xD;
      improving attention, abstract reasoning, and visuospatial abilities showed PD patients had&#xD;
      significantly improved verbal fluency, immediate and delayed logical memory, and visuospatial&#xD;
      reasoning compared with their baseline assessments; these gains were maintained after 6&#xD;
      months. Improvement on measures of executive skills were shown after completing an&#xD;
      intervention consisted of in-person training with practice exercises and worksheets on&#xD;
      attention tasks. Daily at-home practice exercises were also encouraged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similar cognitive impairment is also common among multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, reporting&#xD;
      mainly attention and memory complaints. In a double-blinded, randomized, placebo controlled&#xD;
      trial of an intervention to improve learning and memory, MS patients were taught to use a&#xD;
      modified &quot;story memory technique&quot; which used context and imagery to improve learning and,&#xD;
      therefore, recall. Participants who had moderate to severe learning impairments showed a&#xD;
      significant improvement in learning abilities. The use of the modified story memory technique&#xD;
      is recommended as a practice guideline for the remediation of learning and memory in MS&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Altogether, these reports demonstrate quite conclusively the salience of cognitive&#xD;
      dysfunction and its impact on daily life for patients who have FM. Comorbid symptoms&#xD;
      (depression, anxiety, fatigue and disturbed sleep) can negatively impact on cognitive&#xD;
      function, but can not fully explain the findings. In one study, pain did have a robust effect&#xD;
      on cognitive function and could explain the dysfunction found in FM. There is a need to&#xD;
      further assess cognitive function in FM along with the possible comorbid symptoms. Based on&#xD;
      our preliminary findings there is also a need to broaden assessment of executive functions.&#xD;
      In addition, cognitive rehabilitation has proved to be successful in a variety of conditions&#xD;
      involve cognitive impairment. One may suggest that if a specific cognitive impairment pattern&#xD;
      can be identified in FM patients, a cognitive rehabilitation plan can then be tailored to fit&#xD;
      these patients' needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objects of the proposed research are to perform:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A broad neuro-cognitive testing battery on a large population of Fibromyalgia patients.&#xD;
           Previous testing did not fully evaluate executive functions; therefore the investigators&#xD;
           are adding specific testing for these functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A broad assessment for Axis I psychiatric co-morbidity in the FM population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A broad assessment for FM additional symptoms: depressive symptoms, anxiety, fatigue,&#xD;
           pain, sleep disturbances.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. An attempt to identify &quot;pure&quot; cognitive deficits that are unique to FM patients and can&#xD;
           be directly attributed to FM. Therefore, possible correlation between neuro-cognitive&#xD;
           impairments, Axis I psychiatric diagnoses, additional FM symptoms and motivation levels&#xD;
           will be performed and data will be analyzed while controlling for these confounders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Develop a cognitive rehabilitation program based on the cognitive dysfunction the&#xD;
           investigators discover in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Based on the cognitive dysfunction the investigators discover in the study the&#xD;
           investigators hope to compile a shorter neuro-cognitive battery for clinical use in FM&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
&#xD;

             1. 100mm Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) Fatigue&#xD;
&#xD;
           1. Fatigue Severity Scale 2. Brief Fatigue Inventory Sleep disturbance&#xD;
&#xD;
           1. Insomnia Severity Scale&#xD;
&#xD;
           B. Time schedule The investigators plan on recruiting the patients over a period of 18&#xD;
           months. The analysis of the data will take a further 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
           C. Expected results The investigators expect to find extensive but specific pattern of&#xD;
           cognitive dysfunction in the FM patients, compared to the norms found in the healthy&#xD;
           population. The investigators expect to find cognitive dysfunction in the field of:&#xD;
           working memory, episodic memory, semantic memory. The investigators are expanding the&#xD;
           assessment to include executive functions and expect to find significant dysfunction in&#xD;
           this area. The investigators do expect to find psychological factors such as depression&#xD;
           and anxiety and additional FM symptoms such as pain and fatigue. The investigators mean&#xD;
           to control for these symptoms in order to expose the &quot;pure&quot; cognitive dysfunction&#xD;
           characteristic of FM, that which can not be explained by these active symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
           D. Significance FM is a common disabling disorder with many complex symptoms. Evidence&#xD;
           continues to mount that cognitive dysfunction is a real and troubling symptom with&#xD;
           working memory, episodic memory and semantic memory mostly affected. In addition, FM&#xD;
           patients seem particularly sensitive to distraction and in our preliminary data they&#xD;
           appear specifically to have executive dysfunction. This study aims to broadly assess&#xD;
           neuro-cognitive function in FM patients for possible neuro-cognitive deficits with a&#xD;
           specific focus on executive functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Since Axis I psychiatric disorders, mental symptoms (depression and anxiety) and&#xD;
           additional FM symptoms (fatigue, pain and sleep disturbances) may all affect cognitive&#xD;
           function, the investigators will also assess these factors. In the analysis of our&#xD;
           expected data the investigators will &quot;control&quot; for these possible confounders in hope of&#xD;
           finding a unique neuro-cognitive dysfunction pattern specific for FM patients. The&#xD;
           investigators than intend on compiling a shorter, &quot;user friendly&quot;, neuro-cognitive&#xD;
           battery, that may serve clinicians in their routine assessment of FM patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The investigators aim to develop a cognitive rehabilitation program that will&#xD;
           specifically address the cognitive dysfunction the investigators expect to discover in&#xD;
           this study. Munguia-Izquierdo and Lagaz-Arrese found that aquatic therapy (exercise in&#xD;
           warm water) indirectly improved many symptoms in FM, including cognitive function.&#xD;
           Leavitt and Katz found that rehearsal helped subjects with FM overcome the effects of&#xD;
           distraction in a memory test. Based on these studies, but more on the extensive&#xD;
           knowledge from cognitive rehabilitation programs in other clinical states, the&#xD;
           investigators are determined to develop our own cognitive rehabilitation program that&#xD;
           will supplement other pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions in FM&#xD;
           patients. By this the investigators will offer a unique and novel intervention for Fm&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
