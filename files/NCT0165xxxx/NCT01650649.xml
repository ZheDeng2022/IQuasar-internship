    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess QTc (an interval of the heart rhythm)&#xD;
      interaction effects between lofexidine and methadone. The secondary objectives of the study&#xD;
      are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of lofexidine by evaluating and monitoring&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (amounts of drug in the blood), vital signs (heart rate and blood pressure)&#xD;
      and adverse events (side effects) when co-administered with methadone; to describe effects on&#xD;
      opiate withdrawal when lofexidine is introduced following a 50% methadone dose reduction, as&#xD;
      required to elicit a withdrawal response; and to evaluate the QTc interaction effects of&#xD;
      lofexidine compared with placebo. The investigators hypothesize that while both agents&#xD;
      (lofexidine and methadone) are known to prolong the QTc interval, the combination of the&#xD;
      drugs will not create an additive effect which creates a significant safety concern. The&#xD;
      investigators further hypothesize that subjects will be able to tolerate the therapeutic dose&#xD;
      of lofexidine (0.8 mg four times daily) when the methadone maintenance dose is lowered to&#xD;
      elicit withdrawal.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multiple ascending dose study to&#xD;
      assess the safety, tolerability, and electrocardiographic effects of lofexidine in 24&#xD;
      methadone-maintained adult subjects. The study will include a Screening Visit, an Inpatient&#xD;
      Treatment Visit, and a Follow-Up Visit. Subjects will be randomized in 3:1 ratio to receive&#xD;
      up to 4 tablets of lofexidine (0.2 mg/tablet) QID or 4 tablets matching placebo QID.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who are on a stable dose of methadone (80 - 120 mg/day) and who satisfy inclusion&#xD;
      and exclusion criteria will be eligible for the study. Within 21 days of the Screening Visit,&#xD;
      subjects will report to the inpatient study facility to begin the Inpatient Treatment Visit&#xD;
      which will last between approximately 11 to 21 days. This visit will include an inpatient&#xD;
      check-in (1 day), Methadone Baseline (1 day), Initial Lofexidine Titration (3 to 5 days), 1&#xD;
      or 2 Lofexidine Plateaus (2 to 4 days), Methadone Reduction (2 to 6 days) and Methadone&#xD;
      Re-Titration and Discharge (2 to 4 days). The order of steps subjects will proceed through&#xD;
      during the Inpatient Treatment Visit will vary depending on whether subjects are able to&#xD;
      titrate to the highest dose of lofexidine or placebo during the Initial Lofexidine Titration.&#xD;
      The highest dose of lofexidine (or placebo) will be 4 tablets QID (0.2 mg lofexidine per&#xD;
      tablet or placebo) for a total daily lofexidine dose of 16 tablets (3.2 mg or placebo).&#xD;
      Diagrams for the two scenarios that can occur with lofexidine titration are located in Figure&#xD;
      1 and 2 in the body of the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the Methadone Baseline phase subjects will take a single daily dose of methadone at 1&#xD;
      PM and undergo baseline study assessments including electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring, blood&#xD;
      collection for methadone pharmacokinetics, and opiate withdrawal assessments (Clinical Opiate&#xD;
      Withdrawal Scale, COWS and Short Opiate Withdrawal Scale, SOWS). The next day subjects will&#xD;
      proceed to the Initial Lofexidine Titration phase. Subjects will continue using their&#xD;
      baseline methadone dose. Lofexidine will be initiated at 2 tablets (0.4 mg or placebo) QID&#xD;
      and titrated in daily increments of a single tablet (0.2 mg or placebo) QID to a total daily&#xD;
      dose of 0.8 mg QID (or placebo), if tolerated by the subject. Lofexidine doses will escalate&#xD;
      daily unless at any point the subject meets protocol-defined dose hold criteria (described&#xD;
      below), which will trigger a reduction in dose to the previous highest tolerated dose (or to&#xD;
      the 1 tablet dose, 0.2 mg or placebo, if subjects cannot tolerate the initial 2 tablets).&#xD;
      Once subjects have titrated to the highest dose (ie, 4 tablets QID) or once the highest&#xD;
      tolerated dose has been determined, they will proceed to a 2-day Lofexidine Plateau phase&#xD;
      during which they will continue to receive their methadone maintenance dose. If the subject&#xD;
      is unable to titrate up to 4 tablets QID (0.8 mg or placebo), the subject will continue to&#xD;
      receive their highest tolerated dose in equal increments (eg, 2 or 3 tablets QID at 8AM, 1PM,&#xD;
      6PM, 11PM) for both days of the plateau. If the subject tolerates 4 tablets QID (0.8 mg or&#xD;
      placebo), on the first day they will receive the 4 tablets QID (0.8 mg or placebo) according&#xD;
      to the normal dosing schedule. On the second day, the lofexidine dosing schedule will be&#xD;
      modified with subjects receiving a 1 tablet (ie, 0.2 mg or placebo) increase of the 1 PM&#xD;
      lofexidine dose (5 tablets: 1 mg or placebo) and a 1 tablet (0.2 mg or placebo) reduction in&#xD;
      the subsequent lofexidine dose (3 tablets: 0.6 mg or placebo) with the other 2 doses of 4&#xD;
      tablets (0.8 mg or placebo) for a total daily dose of 16 tablets (3.2 mg/day or placebo). On&#xD;
      the second day of the Lofexidine Plateau phase, subjects will undergo electrocardiogram (ECG)&#xD;
      monitoring and blood collection for methadone and lofexidine pharmacokinetics. COWS and SOWS&#xD;
      assessments will be performed on both days of the Lofexidine Plateau.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who are titrated to a daily dose of 4 tablets (0.8 mg or placebo) QID while&#xD;
      receiving their full dose of methadone will undergo a 4-day methadone dose reduction of 50%&#xD;
      while continuing to take lofexidine or placebo at a daily dose of 16 tablets to evaluate the&#xD;
      effects of lofexidine on methadone withdrawal signs and symptoms. These subjects who complete&#xD;
      the initial Lofexidine Plateau at a dose of 0.8 mg lofexidine (or placebo) QID and who reach&#xD;
      a COWS of 5 or greater prior to the fourth day of the reduced methadone dose administration&#xD;
      may proceed early to Methadone Re-titration and Discharge at the Investigator's discretion.&#xD;
      If the COWS score does not reach 5 within 4 days, the subject will proceed to Methadone&#xD;
      Re-titration and Discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who are unable to titrate to the highest lofexidine dose (4 tablets: 0.8 mg or&#xD;
      placebo QID) while receiving their full dose of methadone will undergo a methadone dose&#xD;
      reduction of 50% for up to 6 days while continuing to receive their highest tolerated dose of&#xD;
      lofexidine from the initial titration. On the fourth day (or earlier at the investigator's&#xD;
      discretion based on withdrawal response), lofexidine titration will resume by adding an&#xD;
      incremental 1 tablet (0.2 mg or placebo) QID to the previously established tolerated dose up&#xD;
      to the maximum 4 tablet (0.8 mg or placebo) QID dose. During these subsequent titration&#xD;
      attempts lofexidine (or placebo) doses will escalate daily beginning on the fourth day of the&#xD;
      reduction (or earlier based on discretion of the investigator) unless in any event a subject&#xD;
      meets protocol defined dose-hold criteria (described below), which will trigger a reduction&#xD;
      in dose to the previous highest tolerated dose and will require the Lofexidine Plateau&#xD;
      procedures described above to be repeated while maintaining the subject on their newly&#xD;
      reduced methadone dose (eg, 50% of their maintenance dose). Subjects who are unable to&#xD;
      titrate to a higher lofexidine dose during the 50% Methadone Reduction than the dose they&#xD;
      titrated to during the Initial Lofexidine Titration will not repeat the Lofexidine Plateau&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Methadone Reduction (whether for subjects entering an experimental 4-day 50%&#xD;
      withdrawal phase at the tolerated 4 tablet [0.8 mg or placebo] QID lofexidine dose or for&#xD;
      subjects continuing lofexidine titration at 50% methadone reduction), COWS and SOWS&#xD;
      assessments of opiate withdrawal will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following completion of the Lofexidine Plateau (repeated as necessary) and Methadone&#xD;
      Reduction, subjects will begin the Methadone Re-Titration and Discharge phase during which&#xD;
      lofexidine or placebo will be discontinued and methadone will be re-titrated to the starting&#xD;
      dose (or to a higher or lower dose relative to baseline as medically indicated at the&#xD;
      discretion of the investigator). Lofexidine may be used to treat withdrawal symptoms, if&#xD;
      necessary. Following successful methadone titration and completion of study assessments,&#xD;
      subjects will be discharged from the inpatient study clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will return to the study clinic for a follow-up visit 7 days (±2 days) following&#xD;
      clinic discharge for safety follow-up and adverse event collection. Subjects will be&#xD;
      discharged from the study at this time unless they are medically unstable on their dose of&#xD;
      methadone. Subject may be medically followed at a regular interval, as determined by the&#xD;
      investigator, until the subject is considered sufficiently stable for study discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who withdraw consent or meet any one of the following study termination criteria&#xD;
      prior to completion of the study will be withdrawn. Study termination criteria will apply&#xD;
      only to pre-dose readings. Baseline values for vital signs and ECG readings refer to values&#xD;
      obtained at the time subjects are admitted to the clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Cardiovascular events including the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) &lt;70 mmHg and &gt;20% below baseline value (if subject is&#xD;

&#xD;
             2. Diastolic blood pressure (DBP) &lt;40 mmHg and &gt;20% below baseline value (if subject&#xD;
                is asymptomatic, DBP termination criteria &lt;30 mmHg)*&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Heart rate (HR) &lt;40 bpm and &gt;20% below baseline value (if subject is asymptomatic,&#xD;

&#xD;
             4. QTc &gt;500 msec or &gt;25% above baseline value for both males and females*&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Absolute QTcF&gt;500 ms in females or &gt;480 ms in males with a concurrent increase in&#xD;
                average QTcF value &gt;60 ms from the baseline value&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Persistent increase in QTcF &gt;60 ms above baseline or persistent QTcF≥480 ms and&#xD;
                ≤500 ms and electrolytes are normal&#xD;
&#xD;
             7. Absolute QRS&gt;120 ms along with a 25% increase from baseline&#xD;

                *ECGs and vital signs may be repeated as appropriate to confirm values and rule out&#xD;
                extraneous results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Serious medical problems thought to be related or unrelated to the study medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Intercurrent illness or medical complications that, in the opinion of the site&#xD;
           investigator, preclude safe administration of study medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time of termination from the study, subjects will be discontinued from lofexidine or&#xD;
      placebo; however, they may remain inpatient for up to 4 days while their methadone&#xD;
      maintenance dose is re-titrated to their pre-study maintenance dose.&#xD;
