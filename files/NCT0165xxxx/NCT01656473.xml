  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the preliminary effectiveness and feasibility of an&#xD;
      integrated treatment approach for youth with concurrent disorders. The combined intervention&#xD;
      will include individual sessions of Motivational Interviewing, followed by inclusion in a&#xD;
      Dialectical Behaviour Therapy skills-based group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following main hypotheses will be examined:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Youth with CD who receive an MI intervention will show increased motivation and&#xD;
           readiness to change from pre to post MI intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Youth with CD who participate in a DBT intervention (orientation session followed by&#xD;
           12-week DBT skills training group)will show reductions in substance use and improvements&#xD;
           in mental health, coping and affect regulation between pre to post treatment. The&#xD;
           investigators expect that these treatment gains will be maintained at three-month&#xD;
           follow-up.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For this study, the investigators want to treat adolescents with concurrent disorders.&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will be invited to participate in the combined intervention described in&#xD;
      detail below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to determine eligibility, designated research staff will conduct a phone screen&#xD;
      interview with interested youth (ages 14 - 18). Candidates will be asked questions about&#xD;
      their current mental health and substance use status. Based on the information obtained in&#xD;
      this interview, those youth who report co-occurring mental health and substance use problems&#xD;
      will be asked to complete three internet-based self-report questionnaires using a designated&#xD;
      link and unique identification numbers. Once the information from this assessment is&#xD;
      collected and scored by research personnel, those candidates who meet the criteria for this&#xD;
      study will be asked to participate in the remaining portion of the study. These subjects will&#xD;
      be required to meet with the research assistant in person to complete a computer-based&#xD;
      self-administered structured diagnostic interview and self-report questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If eligible and interested, subjects will be asked to meet with a therapist for one&#xD;
      individual session of MI. These sessions will assess subjects' readiness to engage in&#xD;
      treatment, and help identify treatment goals and any barriers that may make treatment&#xD;
      difficult.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After these sessions, subjects will be invited to attend a DBT-focused orientation prior to&#xD;
      joining the 12-week skills group. The investigators expect to have approximately 8 youth in&#xD;
      each group and each session will run for 2 hours, weekly. The purpose of these group sessions&#xD;
      is to learn skills that will help subjects cope in healthier ways. The following skills will&#xD;
      be taught: (1) interpersonal effectiveness; (2) emotion regulation; (3) distress tolerance:&#xD;
      and (4) mindfulness. The use of skills will be geared to addressing substance use problems&#xD;
      and other mental health issues (e.g. anxiety, depression, self-harm, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to complete questionnaires at the following time-points:&#xD;
      screening, baseline, post-MI (2 weeks), mid-DBT (8 weeks), post-DBT (14 weeks), and at 14&#xD;
      weeks follow-up. Participants will be offered financial compensation upon completion of each&#xD;
      assessment package.&#xD;
