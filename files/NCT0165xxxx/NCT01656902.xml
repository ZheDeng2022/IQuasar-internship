  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this phase 3 clinical trial, a second generation ACI (autologous chondrocyte implantation&#xD;
      technique) is compared to standard of care therapy (microfracture) to treat traumatic&#xD;
      cartilage defects of the knee for efficacy and safety. The investigated study treatment&#xD;
      NOVOCART 3D plus is a biphasic biological scaffold which contains cultivated chondrocytes&#xD;
      derived from the patient in a previous tissue harvest procedure. Allocation to the study&#xD;
      treatment is done by randomization in a ration of 2:1 in favor to ACI (investigational&#xD;
      product). Follow-up data for efficacy is collected for 2 years: follow-up visits are&#xD;
      performed 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months and 24 months after treatment;&#xD;
      additional data for safety will be collected for up to 5 years: 36, 48, and 60 months after&#xD;
      treatment. The study involves knee surgery (by arthroscopy, or mini-arthrotomically for&#xD;
      implantation surgery), and blood withdrawal for safety within the first year after treatment.&#xD;
      Initial imaging is required at baseline. Optional MRI imaging and biomarker collection is&#xD;
      done as substudy at specific sites only.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For the cartilage cell product NOVOCART® 3D plus, which is used in the study described here,&#xD;
      the company TETEC AG obtained an expanded production authorization from the medication&#xD;
      monitoring authorities in compliance with Section 13, Para. 1 of the Medicinal Products Act&#xD;
      in 2003. This entitles TETEC AG to produce the pharmaceutical product and already distribute&#xD;
      it. More than 6000 patients were already successfully treated with NOVOCART® 3D in Europe&#xD;
      since 2003. In order to obtain a general market authorization for NOVOCART® 3D plus, this&#xD;
      control group study is conducted, in which the superiority of the safety and effectiveness of&#xD;
      carrier-bound Autologous Chondrocyte Transplantation with NOVOCART® 3D plus compared to the&#xD;
      standard of care microfracture surgery needs to be proven. This study further aims at&#xD;
      developing and validating known and new biologic markers for the quality and clinical&#xD;
      efficacy of the product as requested in the context of identity, purity and potency&#xD;
      characteristics of the medicinal/investigational product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will receive one of the therapeutic procedures in the study. The treatment&#xD;
      procedure which will be used will be decided by a previously specified randomization process.&#xD;
      This type of study meets the high quality requirements of the statutorily specified safety&#xD;
      and quality regulations which are also referred to as &quot;Good Clinical Practice&quot; (GCP). The&#xD;
      probability of the patient being allocated to one of the two treatments is 2:1; that is, an&#xD;
      approx. 67% probability of therapy with NOVOCART® 3D plus and an approx. 33% probability of&#xD;
      therapy with microfracture. Neither the patient, nor the investigator will be able to&#xD;
      influence the treatment assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be screened for eligibility at the Screening Visit. Each patient will remain in&#xD;
      the study for 24 months post-implant for the effectiveness assessments, and then an&#xD;
      additional three years to complete the planned post-market phase. Each patient will be in the&#xD;
      study for up to five years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cells and tissues collected from this study will be used in other in vitro-controlled&#xD;
      experiments aimed at developing and validating known and novel biologic markers to quantify&#xD;
      cell quality in the context of identity, purity and potency. Prognostic values of these&#xD;
      biologic markers will be examined by correlating them with clinical data collected in this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
