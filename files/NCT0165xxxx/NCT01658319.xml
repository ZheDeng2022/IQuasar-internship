    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of methoxyamine when given&#xD;
      together with fludarabine phosphate in treating patients with relapsed or refractory&#xD;
      hematologic malignancies. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as methoxyamine and fludarabine&#xD;
      phosphate, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the&#xD;
      cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving methoxyamine together with fludarabine&#xD;
      phosphate may kill more cancer cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of methoxyamine given in conjunction with&#xD;
      fludarabine (fludarabine phosphate) in subjects with relapsed or refractory hematologic&#xD;
      malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the dose limiting toxicities of the combination of methoxyamine and&#xD;
      fludarabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the pharmacokinetics of methoxyamine when given in combination with&#xD;
      fludarabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate pharmacodynamic endpoints including apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites and&#xD;
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) strand breaks in blood mononuclear cells to explore the in vivo&#xD;
      mechanism of action of methoxyamine and identify the biologically optimal dose to be combined&#xD;
      with fludarabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To determine the disease specific toxicity and biologic activity in a cohort of chronic&#xD;
      lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of methoxyamine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1-5 and&#xD;
      methoxyamine IV over 1 hour on day 1 (day 2 of course 1). Treatment repeats every 28 days for&#xD;
      up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 1&#xD;
      year.&#xD;
