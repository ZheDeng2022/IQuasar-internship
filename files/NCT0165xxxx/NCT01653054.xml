  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rationale for this study is that the risk of anal dysplasia in patients with inflammatory&#xD;
      bowel disease (IBD) as compared to the general population has yet to be investigated&#xD;
      prospectively. There have only been a few articles examining this relationship - preliminary&#xD;
      results have suggested that patients with IBD are at increased risk for abnormal anal pap&#xD;
      smears. As high grade anal dysplasia is strongly associated with an increased risk of anal&#xD;
      carcinoma, it is important to identify all high risk groups that might benefit from routine&#xD;
      screening. This pilot study aims to determine whether patients with IBD in our Bronx&#xD;
      population have an increased risk of abnormal anal Pap smears. We hypothesize that there will&#xD;
      be an increased incidence of abnormal anal pap smears in patients with IBD who have been&#xD;
      treated with immunosuppressants, given that chronic immunosuppression is related to increased&#xD;
      HPV infection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      IBD patients on and off immunosuppression will be identified from gastroenterology fellow&#xD;
      clinics. After patients express interest in the study, a study coordinator will provide an&#xD;
      overview of the study and obtain consent prior to initiating any research related procedures.&#xD;
      Anal Pap smears and Digene Hybrid Capture 2 High-Risk HPV DNA Tests will be performed on each&#xD;
      study patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medications will be documented for all IBD subjects and controls. Patient characteristics&#xD;
      that will be documented will include IBD diagnosis, area of involvement (small bowel vs.&#xD;
      large bowel, rectal involvement), type and duration of immunosuppressant use, smoking status,&#xD;
      family history of any dysplasia (including anus), and reproductive risk factors. Data will be&#xD;
      reported by subjects in subject interviews and through questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the purposes of analysis, subjects will be divided into two groups: IBD patients on&#xD;
      immunosuppression and IBD patients not on immunosuppression. Results will be recorded in&#xD;
      relation to exposure to immunosuppressive agents including prednisone, purine analogs&#xD;
      (azathioprine/6MP), methotrexate, and infliximab. Immunosuppression will be defined as a&#xD;
      history of at least three months of azathioprine/6MP, eight consecutive weeks of prednisone&#xD;
      greater than 15mg per day, a cumulative dose of greater than 100mg of methotrexate, or at&#xD;
      least one infusion of infliximab within 8 weeks of the date of the anal Pap smear. Since this&#xD;
      is a pilot project, we will recruit a minimum of 20 subjects to each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abnormalities will be classified in standard Bethesda classifications as atypical squamous&#xD;
      cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS), low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL),&#xD;
      high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) or carcinoma. The pathologist reading the&#xD;
      Pap smears will be blinded to the patient status (IBD versus control) and immunomodulator&#xD;
      history.&#xD;
