  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) in complete remission will receive eltrombopag&#xD;
      while undergoing consolidation chemotherapy with high-dose cytarabine. Eltrombopag may help&#xD;
      increase the number of platelets during chemotherapy and may help prevent the risk of&#xD;
      bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I will study the side effects, best dose and platelet effects of eltrombopag when given&#xD;
      with consolidation chemotherapy. After the maximum safe and tolerated dose and schedule is&#xD;
      found in Phase I, the study will proceed to Phase II. Phase II will confirm the dose and&#xD;
      schedule of eltrombopag identified in Phase I that can increase platelet counts in patients&#xD;
      receiving consolidation therapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Consolidation chemotherapy with high dose cytarabine usually causes myelosuppression for 14&#xD;
      to 21 days after each treatment. Patients have low blood counts for days or weeks before the&#xD;
      bone marrow resumes function. This may result in e.g., hospitalization, treatment with&#xD;
      antibiotics, and transfusions with blood and/or platelets. In addition, this may cause a&#xD;
      delay in treatment and reduction in dose. To achieve the best outcome from treatment, dose&#xD;
      reductions and delays in treatment must be avoided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence and duration of decreased white blood cells (neutropenia) and neutropenic&#xD;
      complications have been reduced by the use of growth colony stimulating factors.&#xD;
      Additionally, the use of erythropoietin-stimulating factors has reduced anemia and the need&#xD;
      for red blood cell transfusions. Thrombocytopenia remains an important limiting factor in&#xD;
      administration of chemotherapy and maintaining dose intensity in some patients. Additionally,&#xD;
      the risk of bleeding secondary to low platelet counts may increase sickness or even death in&#xD;
      patients undergoing cancer treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thrombopoietin (TPO) is the principal cytokine involved in the regulation of megakaryopoiesis&#xD;
      and platelet production. Eltrombopag is an orally bioavailable, small molecule, TPO-receptor&#xD;
      agonist that stimulates platelet production by a similar, but not identical, mechanism to&#xD;
      endogenous TPO. Eltrombopag has been approved in the U.S. for the treatment of chronic&#xD;
      Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura. Eltrombopag is also under development for other&#xD;
      indications such as Hepatitis C Virus-associated thrombocytopenia, Myelodysplastic&#xD;
      Syndrome/AML, and oncology related thrombocytopenias. This agent appears to possess many of&#xD;
      the desirable properties for a treatment for chemotherapy induced thrombocytopenia, including&#xD;
      oral administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Phase I portion of this study will be conducted using a dose escalation/de-escalation&#xD;
      strategy for patients in either the first or second complete remission. Dose escalations are&#xD;
      planned in the form of both acceleration of date of initiation of eltrombopag relative to the&#xD;
      start of consolidation chemotherapy as well as increasing daily dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Phase II portion will be conducted using the dose and schedule selected from the Phase I&#xD;
      portion of the study for those patients in first complete remission. Patients will be used as&#xD;
      their own controls, e.g., a two-period two-treatment cross-over design. Patients will be&#xD;
      randomly allocated 1:1 to one of two sequences. Patients randomized to Sequence A will&#xD;
      receive eltrombopag with their first cycle of consolidation and placebo with Cycle 2.&#xD;
      Patients randomized to Sequence B will receive placebo with their first cycle of&#xD;
      consolidation and eltrombopag with Cycle 2. The treatment assignment will be blinded to the&#xD;
      patient and all study/sponsor personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo blood sample collection for Thrombopoietin(TPO)/ Erythropoietin(EPO)&#xD;
      and pharmacokinetic analysis of eltrombopag in Phase I and pharmacokinetic analysis of&#xD;
      eltrombopag in the Phase II portion of the study.&#xD;
