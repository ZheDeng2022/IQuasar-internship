      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Stress can cause people to give in to temptations to eat less healthily. People who are on&#xD;
      weight loss diets often have problems sticking to their diets when they are stressed. Some&#xD;
      tests have shown that the drug pexacerfont can help reduce stress-related seeking of&#xD;
      high-calorie foods. However, it has not been tested on reducing food craving. Researchers&#xD;
      want to test pexacerfont on people who are on diets to see if it can reduce stress-related&#xD;
      food cravings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To see if pexacerfont can help reduce stress-induced food cravings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals between 21 and 65 years of age who are on a diet to control their weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. This study&#xD;
           requires seven visits over about 35 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will take either pexacerfont or placebo pills during the study. They will&#xD;
           have three pills every morning. They will record video of themselves taking the pills&#xD;
           every day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Every evening, participants will fill out a questionnaire. It will ask questions about&#xD;
           feelings and behaviors related to eating and food craving.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have regular study visits while taking the pills. The visits will&#xD;
           involve questions about stressful situations and food cravings. One visit will involve a&#xD;
           mildly stressful math test, followed by tasting of different foods. This test will look&#xD;
           at whether pexacerfont can affect food preferences. Participants will provide blood and&#xD;
           saliva samples as directed at these study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have follow-up phone calls 1, 3, and 6 months after the end of the&#xD;
           study.&#xD;

      Objective: To evaluate pexacerfont, an orally available, brain-penetrant selective CRF1&#xD;
      antagonist, for its ability to modulate food craving and consumption in chronic unsuccessful&#xD;
      dieters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: We will collect evaluable data from up to 90 restrained eaters (individuals&#xD;
      who indicate a history of chronic yo-yo dieting by scoring 15 or higher on the Dietary&#xD;
      Restraint Scale). To ensure that all participants have some degree of preoccupation with&#xD;
      food, an additional inclusion criterion will be endorsement of the Restraint Scale item Do&#xD;
      you give too much time and thought to food? Apart from their preoccupation with food,&#xD;
      participants will be healthy. They can be either normal-weight or overweight (Body Mass Index&#xD;
      (BMI) &gt; 22kg/m2); this will be stratified across dose groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Frank eating disorders will be exclusionary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: This will be a randomized, double-blind, between-groups study with two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be stabilized on either pexacerfont or placebo for 28 days (300 mg/day&#xD;
      loading dose for 7 days, followed by 100 mg/day maintenance dose for 21 days). On day 15,&#xD;
      they will undergo a math-test stressor and have stress-induced food consumption and craving&#xD;
      assessed in a bogus taste test and on visual-analog scales. During three subsequent visits&#xD;
      between days 16 and 28, they will be exposed to three personalized imagery-induction&#xD;
      scripts-one stress-related, one food-related, and one neutral/relaxing. Food craving and food&#xD;
      consumption will be assessed on those visits as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: The primary outcome measure is stress-induced eating after the math-test&#xD;
      stressor. Other outcome measures will include spontaneous food consumption after the other&#xD;
      stressors, subjective ratings of stress, mood, and food craving, autonomic responses&#xD;
      (galvanic skin response (GSR), heart rate, and blood pressure), and endocrine responses&#xD;
      (salivary cortisol, salivary alpha-amylase, and serum cortisol).&#xD;

             specifically, a condom plus spermicide and a female diaphragm or cervical cap; or&#xD;
             using an approved intrauterine device (IUD) with established efficacy.&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Current employment at NIDA IRP or Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS), or being in the&#xD;
             immediate family of an employee. Immediate family is defined as a spouse, parent,&#xD;
             child, or sibling, whether biological or legally adopted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Current participation in another clinical study that includes exposure to an&#xD;
             investigational or non-investigational drug or device.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Participation in a clinical study for a condition related to weight or dieting within&#xD;
             the preceding month.&#xD;

             compounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Any medical condition or laboratory finding that, in the judgment of the&#xD;
             investigators, could adversely affect safety or study integrity. Examples include but&#xD;
             are not limited to diabetes type 1 and type 2, ischemic heart disease, uncontrolled&#xD;
             hypertension, and history of cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic attack.&#xD;

          7. Past or present diagnosis of any eating disorder, including Anorexia Nervosa, Bulimia&#xD;
             Nervosa, and Eating Disorder NOS (e.g., Binge-Eating Disorder). (Eating-disordered&#xD;
             individuals probably represent a distinct population and should therefore be studied&#xD;
             separately.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Past or present diagnosis of schizophrenia, bipolar disease, or any psychotic&#xD;
             disorder; past or present diagnosis of dementia or any other disorder that has led to&#xD;

&#xD;
         12. Adrenal or pituitary pathology as evidenced by medical history or suggested by&#xD;
             abnormal screening labs.&#xD;
&#xD;

             Disease, multiple sclerosis, stroke, neurodegenerative disease, cerebral palsy) or&#xD;
             severe head trauma (including closed head trauma, penetrating head injury, skull&#xD;
             fracture, or intracranial hemorrhage), or CNS tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Active liver disease or a history of hepatic intolerance to medications that, in the&#xD;
             investigators' judgment, is medically significant.&#xD;
