      The purpose of this study is to determine whether public housing residents trained in Tobacco&#xD;
      Cessation and Motivational Interviewing Techniques to become Tobacco Treatment Advocates(TTA)&#xD;
      will be effective in increasing the quit rate of smokers in Boston Public Housing. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that smokers that receive multiple TTA visits will be more likely&#xD;
      to (1) use smoking cessation resources and (2) quit compared to smokers who receive a single&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a group-randomized trial in which 10 pubic housing developments (PHDs) are&#xD;
      randomized to the experimental condition and 10 to the control condition. All smokers who&#xD;
      enroll in the study at a particular PHD receive the same intervention. Smokers at control&#xD;
      sites receive written materials that offer strategies for quitting and information about&#xD;
      availability of treatment programs, as well as a one-time meeting with a Tobacco Treatment&#xD;
      Advocate (TTA). The intervention group receives the same written materials but also has much&#xD;
      more extensive interactions with a TTA. TTAs provide peer counseling (Peer Counseling is&#xD;
      defined as: performance of limited counselor functions, under counselor supervision, by&#xD;
      person of similar age,gender, race, ethnicity and/or SES of the counselee) to smokers during&#xD;
      in- person Motivational Enhancement meetings (target range 7-9) as well as additional in&#xD;
      person and phone contacts, as needed for each participant, over a 6-month period. TTAs&#xD;
      receive intensive training in motivational interviewing and smoking cessation counseling&#xD;
      deliver the intervention components (counseling activities and provision of environmental&#xD;
      supports) in addition to encouraging utilization of smoking cessation treatment programs such&#xD;
      as the Smokers' QuitLine (SQL) and clinic-based programs. In order to avoid the potential for&#xD;
      contamination due to TTAs interacting with participants at both intervention and control&#xD;
      sites, meetings with participants at control sites are conducted by special Control TTAs.&#xD;
      Data are collected from study participants at baseline, 3 months, 7 months and 12 months, and&#xD;
      also from the SQL and clinics.&#xD;
