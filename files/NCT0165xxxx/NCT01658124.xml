  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe bleeding in the digestive system is a common symptom of many diseases. Each year,&#xD;
      about 50,000 people end up in British hospitals because of this problem and about 5,000 of&#xD;
      them die. The most common cause of this bleeding is stomach ulcers. In sub-Saharan Africa,&#xD;
      schistosomiasis (parasitic worms) is responsible for about 130,000 deaths from stomach&#xD;
      bleeding each year. From previous research in other bleeding conditions such as surgery and&#xD;
      trauma, we know that a drug called tranexamic acid can reduce bleeding and save lives. We now&#xD;
      want to do the HALT-IT trial to see if giving tranexamic acid can save lives and if there are&#xD;
      any complications in people with severe bleeding from the digestive system.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND: Acute gastrointestinal (GI) haemorrhage is one of the most common&#xD;
      gastrointestinal emergencies. It is an important cause of mortality and morbidity in high,&#xD;
      middle and low income countries. The most common causes of upper GI haemorrhage are peptic&#xD;
      ulcer, oesophageal varices and erosive mucosal disease, although the relative frequency of&#xD;
      the different causes varies in different countries. Acute upper GI haemorrhage accounts for&#xD;
      around 50,000 hospital admissions each year in the UK and has a case fatality of about 10%.&#xD;
      The incidence is highest among the most disadvantaged social groups. Lower GI haemorrhage&#xD;
      accounts for a further 15,000 hospital admissions each year and has a case fatality of&#xD;
      between 10% and 20%. Upper GI haemorrhage is also a common medical emergency in low and&#xD;
      middle income countries. Patients are usually young and poor and the source of bleeding is&#xD;
      more often oesophageal varices. Fibrinolysis may play an important pathological role in GI&#xD;
      haemorrhage due to premature breakdown of haemostatic plugs at sites of mucosal injury.&#xD;
      Tranexamic acid (TXA) is a synthetic derivative of the amino acid lysine which inhibits&#xD;
      fibrinolysis by blocking the lysine binding sites on plasminogen. It is a widely used&#xD;
      treatment with a known safety profile. There is reliable evidence that TXA reduces blood&#xD;
      transfusion in surgical patients. A systematic review including 65 trials shows that TXA&#xD;
      reduces the probability of blood transfusion by 39% (RR=0.61, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.70) compared&#xD;
      to control. The effect of TXA on the risk of thromboembolic events in surgical patients&#xD;
      remains uncertain, although there is no evidence of any increase in risk. The CRASH-2 trial&#xD;
      showed that administration of TXA significantly reduces deaths due to bleeding (RR=0.85, 95%&#xD;
      CI 0.76 to 0.96), and all-cause mortality (RR=0.91, 95% CI 0.85 to 0.97) in trauma patients&#xD;
      with significant extra-cranial bleeding, with no increase in vascular occlusive events. A&#xD;
      systematic review conducted by the investigators of TXA in GI bleeding identified nine&#xD;
      randomised trials including a total of 1721 patients. Although there was a statistically&#xD;
      significant reduction in the risk of death in patients treated with TXA (RR=0.66, 95% CI 0.47&#xD;
      to 0.93), the estimate is imprecise and the overall quality of trials was poor. Furthermore,&#xD;
      all but three of the trials were conducted before the widespread use of therapeutic endoscopy&#xD;
      and proton pump inhibitors and even in aggregate the trials were too small to assess the&#xD;
      effects of TXA on other clinical important outcomes such as thromboembolic events. For these&#xD;
      reasons, the effectiveness and safety of TXA for GI haemorrhage is uncertain and there are&#xD;
      currently no formal recommendations for its use as a treatment for GI bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM: The HALT-IT trial will determine the effect of TXA on mortality, morbidity (re-bleeding,&#xD;
      non-fatal vascular events), blood transfusion, surgical intervention and health status in&#xD;
      patients with acute gastrointestinal haemorrhage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY OUTCOME: The primary outcome is death from haemorrhage within 5 days of randomisation&#xD;
      (all cause and cause-specific mortality will also be recorded).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OUTCOMES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Re-bleeding&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Endoscopic, radiological or surgical intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Blood transfusion - blood or blood component units transfused&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Thromboembolic events (myocardial infarction, stroke, pulmonary embolism, deep vein&#xD;
           thrombosis)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Other adverse medical events (including renal failure, significant cardiac event,&#xD;
           respiratory failure, hepatic failure, sepsis, pneumonia, seizure and other reported&#xD;
           events)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Functional status measured using the Katz Index of Independence in Activities of Daily&#xD;
           Living&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Time spent at an intensive care unit&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Length of stay in hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Patient status (death, hospital readmission) at 12 months will be ascertained if&#xD;
           appropriate databases are available in the recruiting country&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRIAL DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pragmatic, randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trial among 12,000 patients with&#xD;
      clinically significant gastrointestinal bleeding&#xD;
&#xD;
      DIAGNOSIS AND INCLUSION/EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults with acute significant upper or lower gastrointestinal bleeding. The diagnosis of&#xD;
      significant bleeding is clinical but may include patients with hypotension, tachycardia, or&#xD;
      those likely to need transfusion, urgent endoscopy or surgery. The fundamental eligibility&#xD;
      criterion is the responsible clinician's 'uncertainty' as to whether or not to use tranexamic&#xD;
      acid in a particular patient with gastrointestinal bleeding. If the clinician believes there&#xD;
      is a clear indication for, or clear contraindication to, tranexamic acid use, the particular&#xD;
      patient should not be randomised. There are no other pre-specified exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TEST PRODUCT, REFERENCE THERAPY, DOSE AND MODE OF ADMINISTRATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A loading dose of tranexamic acid (1 gram by intravenous injection) or placebo (sodium&#xD;
      chloride 0.9%) will be given as soon as possible after randomisation followed by an&#xD;
      intravenous infusion of 3 grams over 24 hours or placebo (sodium chloride 0.9%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SETTING:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will be coordinated from the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine Clinical&#xD;
      Trials Unit (University of London) and conducted in hospitals in low, middle and high income&#xD;
      countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DURATION OF TREATMENT AND PARTICIPATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first dose will be given immediately after randomisation and the maintenance dose will be&#xD;
      given immediately after the loading dose over 24 hours. Participation will end at discharge&#xD;
      from randomising hospital, death or at 28 days post randomisation whichever occurs first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients randomly assigned to one of the treatments will be analysed together (regardless&#xD;
      of whether or not they completed or received that treatment) on an intention to treat basis.&#xD;
