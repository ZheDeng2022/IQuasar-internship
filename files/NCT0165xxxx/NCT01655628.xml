  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is one of the most common malignant tumors in Southern China&#xD;
      and South Asia. After radiotherapy, some patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma still had&#xD;
      distant metastasis. In recent years, some chemotherapeutic agents, such as gemcitabine,&#xD;
      cisplatin, were used to treat patients with advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma, including&#xD;
      those with local recurrence and distant metastases, with a certain short-term effect.&#xD;
      However, chemotherapy alone is still not ideal for effectively improving the prognosis of&#xD;
      patients with advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Therefore, it is necessary to develop&#xD;
      more-effective adjuvant therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CIK cells (cytokine induced killer cells, CIK) are a population of heterogeneous cells&#xD;
      generated by the in vitro amplification of mononuclear cells in peripheral blood. The cells&#xD;
      are co-induced with multiple cytokines; the lymphocytes with co-expression of CD3+CD56+ have&#xD;
      the strongest anti-tumor effect. Because of their non-MHC restricted tumor killing activity,&#xD;
      CIK cells have a powerful anti-tumor effect both in vitro and in vivo, which spans a broad&#xD;
      anti-tumor spectrum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the patients with post-radiotherapy distant metastasis of NPC will be treated&#xD;
      with autologous CIK cells in combination with Gemcitabine plus Cisplatin regimen&#xD;
      chemotherapy(GC). The purpose of this study is to observe and evaluate the toxic side effects&#xD;
      and the short- and long-term efficacy of CIK used in combination with GC chemotherapy to&#xD;
      treat NPC in patients with distant metastasis after radiotherapy. Patients and Methods: 40&#xD;
      patients with distant metastasis after radiotherapy will accept 4 cycles chemotherapy of&#xD;
      Gemcitabine plus cisplatin regimen and then are randomized divided into 2 groups. The 20&#xD;
      patients in GC+CIK group will be treated with maintaining therapy of adoptive autologous CIK&#xD;
      cell transfusion sequentially; the other 20 patients will be followed-up only without CIK&#xD;
      cells treatment. The safety of chemotherapy and CIK cells transfusion and the tumor&#xD;
      regression status will be observed. The early response and long-term efficacy of two groups&#xD;
      patients who accept GC chemotherapy or GC +CIK bio-therapy will be investigated.&#xD;
