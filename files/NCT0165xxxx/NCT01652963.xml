    <textblock>
      The proposed research aims to investigate whether people with intellectual disabilities are&#xD;
      able to understand and apply the theoretical principles of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT)&#xD;
      regarding the interaction between events, beliefs and emotions. Two studies are designed to&#xD;
      assess and train the ability to link events, beliefs and emotions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 1 pilots computer-based tasks to assess the ability to link events, beliefs and&#xD;
      emotions as well as a computer-based training programme aimed to link events and emotions.&#xD;
      Task and training stimuli will be presented by line drawings to investigate whether a&#xD;
      picture-based approach can reduce the impact of verbal ability on task performance. Training&#xD;
      effectiveness is evaluated compared to a no-training control task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 2 compares the line drawings-based approach of Study 1 to a photographic approach to&#xD;
      investigate whether the use of photographs can increase training effectiveness and further&#xD;
      reduce the impact of verbal ability. It is hypothesised that the high reality value of&#xD;
      photographic task stimuli, as compared to line drawings, will have positive effects on the&#xD;
      assessment and training of CBT skills. It is anticipated that the findings of this research&#xD;
      will improve our ability to help people with intellectual disabilities receive CBT.&#xD;

      STUDY 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESES&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A picture-based training programme aimed to link situations and emotions improves the&#xD;
           cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) skill of linking situations, beliefs and emotions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. People with intellectual disabilities can understand and follow the procedures for&#xD;
           computer based assessment and training tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN A 2 x (2 x S) mixed experimental design will be used with a between-subjects factor&#xD;
      (Intervention: training group versus control group) and a within-subjects factor (Time:&#xD;
      baseline assessment versus post-intervention assessment). Baseline and post-intervention&#xD;
      assessment of CBT skills will be derived from the cognitive mediation task developed by&#xD;
      Dagnan et al. (2000). Performance on the post-intervention assessment is considered the&#xD;
      primary outcome variable of the study (Hypothesis 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention in the training group will be based on the Reed and Clements task (1989)&#xD;
      which assesses the ability to link situations and emotions. The intervention in the control&#xD;
      group will consist of the presentation of the same stimulus materials as the intervention&#xD;
      group. The materials will be presented without specific training instructions and matched in&#xD;
      time with the duration of the training group intervention. The control group intervention&#xD;
      allows for an evaluation of training task efficacy rather than evaluating the confounding&#xD;
      effects of presenting certain stimulus materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment and training tasks will all be conducted individually and they will be presented&#xD;
      via a computer programme on a laptop computer with an external response box (Hypothesis 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROCEDURES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-study procedures. When consent has been obtained, the principal investigator assesses&#xD;
      verbal ability (BPVS-2) and level of intellectual functioning (WASI-II). Participants who&#xD;
      meet the inclusion criteria will then be invited to complete the baseline assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline assessments. At baseline, the researcher will introduce the laptop computer and the&#xD;
      external response box. The computer program will be introduced and one sample item of the&#xD;
      assessment will be solved by the computer to illustrate how the task works. The sample item&#xD;
      will then be repeated for the participant to solve and for the researcher to check if the&#xD;
      participant understands the procedures of the task. The sample item will be repeated until&#xD;
      the participant understands the procedures and will have learned how to operate the response&#xD;
      box. The primary investigator will be present to assist the participant with the use of the&#xD;
      response box and to explain the task procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The adapted cognitive mediation task consists of two blocks of twelve exercises. Exercises&#xD;
      are randomised within each block and blocks are counterbalanced between participants. Block 1&#xD;
      presents the six scenarios paired once with a positive and once with a negative thought&#xD;
      resulting in twelve task items. Each task item presents two pictures of a situation followed&#xD;
      by a picture of a positive or negative thought about this situation. Participants are then&#xD;
      prompted to identify which of two pictured emotions (happy or sad) they would feel following&#xD;
      the given situation and thought. Block 2 presents each scenario paired with a positive and&#xD;
      negative emotional response to create twelve task items. Each item presents two pictures of a&#xD;
      situation followed by a picture of an emotional response (happy or sad). Participants are&#xD;
      then prompted to identify which of two thoughts (positive or negative) is most likely to&#xD;
      cause the given emotion in the presented situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention in training group. Participants will be given a break between the baseline&#xD;
      assessment and the intervention task. The primary investigator will be replaced by a second&#xD;
      researcher who will be responsible for conducting the intervention task. The intervention in&#xD;
      the training group is based on a task developed by Reed and Clements (1989). The training&#xD;
      task consists of two blocks of six items presented randomly within each block and blocks&#xD;
      being counterbalanced between participants. Block 1 follows the original task by presenting a&#xD;
      situation and prompting participants to identify whether they would feel happy or sad in the&#xD;
      given situation. Block 2 presents an emotion (happy or sad) and prompts the participant to&#xD;
      identify which of two situations (positive or negative) most likely preceded this emotion.&#xD;
      Each block contains three positive (positive situation or happy emotion given) and three&#xD;
      negative items (negative situation or sad emotion given). The training task will begin with a&#xD;
      sample exercise solved by the computer and a sample exercise for the participant, similarly&#xD;
      to the procedures for the baseline assessment. Within each block there will be at least one&#xD;
      and maximum three training rounds. In the first training round all six items within a block&#xD;
      will be presented. The second and third training rounds will only consist of the items to&#xD;
      which the participant responded incorrect in the previous round. Each item will now be&#xD;
      followed by feedback and incorrect responses will be followed by the correct response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention in control group. The intervention in the control group consists of a&#xD;
      presentation of the stimuli used in the training task. Participants will see situations and&#xD;
      listen to the simultaneous voice recordings. Unlike in the training task participants will&#xD;
      not receive instructions to link situations and emotions. There is no task requirement, just&#xD;
      a presentation of the situation stimuli to assure that potential training effects are due to&#xD;
      the training programme and not merely to the presentation of scenarios. The duration of the&#xD;
      presentation of stimulus materials in the control group will range between fifteen and thirty&#xD;
      minutes. The variable duration is necessary so the primary investigator cannot assume a&#xD;
      participant's intervention group based on the duration of the intervention task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-intervention assessment. Post-intervention assessments will take place fifteen minutes&#xD;
      after the intervention task. The second researcher leaves the room as the primary&#xD;
      investigator returns to conduct the post-intervention assessments. Participants will be&#xD;
      reminded to not disclose any information concerning the intervention task with the&#xD;
      researcher. The post-intervention assessment consists of the adapted cognitive mediation task&#xD;
      of the baseline assessment. The same procedures of the baseline assessment apply to the&#xD;
      post-intervention assessment. Within each block of six exercises, four exercises will be&#xD;
      randomly chosen from the baseline items and two new items will be added.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESES&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Photographs may have an advantage over standard line drawings to improve performance on&#xD;
           tasks assessing the ability to link situations, beliefs and emotions. It is hypothesised&#xD;
           that a photographic approach will increase effectiveness of the CBT skills training. It&#xD;
           is assumed that the high reality value of photographs may enhance identification with&#xD;
           the task materials and thereby improve performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A photographic approach may, when compared to the standard verbal approach and a line&#xD;
           drawings-based approach, reduce the impact of verbal ability on the assessment of CBT&#xD;
           skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A CBT training programme aimed to link situations and emotions may improve both emotion&#xD;
           recognition skills and cognitive mediation skills (as assessed by the ability to link&#xD;
           situation, beliefs and emotions).&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 2 is based on a 2 x (2 x S) mixed experimental design with a between-subjects factors&#xD;
      (Training group: line drawings group versus photographs group) and a within-subjects factor&#xD;
      (Time: baseline assessment versus post-intervention assessments).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline and post-intervention assessment of CBT skills will consist of the adapted cognitive&#xD;
      mediation task, as it is used and described in Study 1, and of an emotion recognition task.&#xD;
      Both assessments will have line drawings and photographs as stimulus materials to investigate&#xD;
      Hypotheses 1 and 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention in both training groups will be based on the Reed and Clements task (1989)&#xD;
      as described in Study 1. Participants in the line drawings group will receive the adapted&#xD;
      Reed and Clements task (1989) based on line drawings. Participants in the photographs group&#xD;
      will be presented photographs as task stimuli. The content of the task items does not differ&#xD;
      between the training groups, only the pictorial presentation of the items differs (Hypothesis&#xD;
      1 and 2). There will be no separate control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROCEDURES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-study procedures. These procedures are identical to the pre-study procedures described in&#xD;
      Study 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline assessments. The primary investigator will begin by reminding the participant that&#xD;
      their participation is voluntary, that all data will be anonymous and that they have the&#xD;
      right to withdraw from the study at any time. The researcher will then introduce the laptop&#xD;
      computer and the external response box and will continue to explain the procedures for the&#xD;
      task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline assessment will consist of the counterbalanced presentation of the emotion&#xD;
      recognition task and the adapted cognitive mediation task. The computer program will be&#xD;
      introduced and one sample item of the first assessment will be solved by the computer to&#xD;
      illustrate how the task works. The sample item will then be repeated for the participant to&#xD;
      solve and for the researcher to check if the participant understands the procedures of the&#xD;
      task. The sample item will be repeated until the participants understands the procedures and&#xD;
      will have learned how to operate the response box. Baseline assessment will consist of the&#xD;
      counterbalanced presentation of the emotion recognition task and the adapted cognitive&#xD;
      mediation task. For each task half of the items will be presented in line drawings and half&#xD;
      of the items in photographs. The procedures for the adapted cognitive mediation task have&#xD;
      been described in Study 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The emotion recognition task in Study 2 will consist of two blocks of six exercises,&#xD;
      counterbalanced between participants. The exercises of block 1 are based on line drawings and&#xD;
      the exercises of block 2 are based on photographs. All exercises, regardless of the block&#xD;
      condition, will begin with a three second presentation of a happy face or a sad face. A voice&#xD;
      recording will be played telling participants which emotion is pictured. This presentation&#xD;
      will be followed by a one second blank screen. Following the blank screen, three new pictures&#xD;
      of various emotions will be shown. A recorded voice will prompt the participants to identify&#xD;
      which of the three presented emotions is similar to the initially presented emotion. The&#xD;
      target emotions will be happy and sad, while the two distracter emotions may vary between&#xD;
      neutral, annoyed, disgusted, grumpy, surprised and angry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention. Participants will be given a break between the baseline assessments and the&#xD;
      training task. The primary investigator will leave the room and will be replaced by the&#xD;
      second researcher who will be responsible for conducting the training task. The training task&#xD;
      is the adapted Reed and Clements (1989) task based on line drawings for the line drawings&#xD;
      group and on photographs for the photographs group. The procedures follow the procedure of&#xD;
      this training task in Study 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-intervention assessments. After the training task participants will be given a short&#xD;
      break and the principal investigator will return to conduct the post-intervention&#xD;
      assessments. The researcher will remind participants to not disclose any information&#xD;
      regarding the training task. Post-intervention assessment of the adapted cognitive mediation&#xD;
      task and the emotion recognition task will follow the same procedures as for their baseline&#xD;
      assessment. For the post-intervention assessment half of the baseline items within each task&#xD;
      block will be replaced with new items to control for rehearsal effects and test for&#xD;
      generalisation of training effects to new items.&#xD;
