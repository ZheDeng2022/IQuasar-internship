      The present study is planned to establish bioequivalence of Duodart® 0.5mg/0.4mg manufactured&#xD;
      by GlaxoSmithKline to concomitant dosing with separate capsules of dutasteride 0.5 mg and&#xD;
      tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg formulations commercially available in Russia. The design of&#xD;
      the present study relies on data obtained in pivotal bioequivalence study and Russian&#xD;
      guidance on high quality bioequivalence studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summary of treatment groups Treatment Sequence Number of subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 18&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 18 Total number of subjects 36 Eligible subjects will be admitted to the research unit&#xD;
           one day prior to dosing (Day 0) and will remain as inpatients until approximately 72&#xD;
           hours after dosing. Subjects will undergo a washout period of approximately 28 days from&#xD;
           each dose of study medication. During washout period subjects will be contacted via&#xD;
           telephone within approximately 10-14 days after the dosing for the collection of&#xD;
           information about adverse events and medications taken by volunteers during washout&#xD;
           period Overall study duration could be about 2 months - Screening up to 21 days + 10&#xD;
           days (5 days of each of 2 treatment periods) + 28 days washout period between treatment&#xD;
           administration + 10-14 days of follow up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon completion of the last dosing session, subjects will be contacted via telephone within&#xD;
      approximately 10-14 days for a follow-up inquiry (or visit at the discretion of the&#xD;
      investigator) and will be subsequently discharged from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Order of Assessments and Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Where multiple measurements/evaluations are scheduled for the same time then the&#xD;
      measurements/evaluations will be taken in the following order:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Vital Signs&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Orthostatic Vital Signs&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. PK - Blood Sample Where multiple measurements/evaluations are scheduled for the same&#xD;
           time then the study co-coordinator will attempt to ensure that the PK samples are drawn&#xD;
           as close to the scheduled time as possible whilst adhering to the order of assessments&#xD;
           as described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Blinding and Randomisation On Day 0 of the first treatment period, subjects will be&#xD;
                randomly allocated at the ratio of 1:1 to one of 2 treatments (refer to Table 1),&#xD;
                according to a computer-generated randomisation list. CRO will generate the&#xD;
                randomisation list. For the purpose of randomisation screening numbers of&#xD;
                volunteers will be used; randomisation numbers will not be assigned to study&#xD;
                subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will be open-label; therefore, blinding procedures are not applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of Subjects Approximately 50 healthy male subjects will be screened to allow 36&#xD;
           eligible subjects to be randomized and ensure that 30 subjects complete the study&#xD;
           according to the protocol without violations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PHARMACOKINETIC PARAMETERS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Drug assay Dutasteride and tamsulosin will be extracted from human plasma by&#xD;
           liquid-liquid extraction using organic solvent. Extracts will be analysed by validated&#xD;
           high-performance liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry. The lower limit of detection&#xD;
           is about 0.1ng/mL&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Calculation of Pharmacokinetic Parameters Pharmacokinetic parameters will be computed&#xD;
           for each subject and treatment using standard methods as described in Appendix II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For tamsulosin, the following PK parameters will be computed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cmax&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tmax&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AUC(0-t)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AUC(0-∞)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Half-life&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mean residence time&#xD;
&#xD;
      For dutasteride, the following PK parameters will be computed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cmax&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tmax&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AUC(0-t)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mean residence time The half-life and AUC(0-∞) will be computed only for tamsulosin&#xD;
           because duration of sampling period equal to 72 h is expected to be non-sufficient for&#xD;
           reliable computation of half-life and AUC(0-∞) of dutasteride given the complex&#xD;
           pharmacokinetics of dutasteride and long half-life of dutasteride at each of two&#xD;
           elimination pathways [12].&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  ADVERSE EVENTS (AE) AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (SAE) The investigator or site staff&#xD;
                is responsible for detecting, documenting and reporting events that meet the&#xD;
                definition of an AE or SAE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AEs will be collected from the start of Study Treatment and until the follow-up contact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAEs will be collected over the same time period as stated above for AEs. However, any SAEs&#xD;
      assessed as related to study participation (e.g. study treatment, protocol-mandated&#xD;
      procedures, invasive tests, or change in existing therapy) or related to a GSK product will&#xD;
      be recorded from the time a subject consents to participate in the study up to and including&#xD;
      any follow-up contact. All SAEs will be recorded and reported to GSK within 24 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  LIFESTYLE AND/OR DIETARY RESTRICTIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Meals and meal composition Subjects will be required to fast for approximately 10 hours&#xD;
           prior to dosing, with the exception of water, which will be allowed freely except for 1&#xD;
           hour before and 1 hour after dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following dosing, subjects will not be allowed food until 4 hours post dose. Meals will be&#xD;
      served at the times outlined in Section 2 (Schedule of Assessments), in a seated position&#xD;
      (unless orthostasis detected, in which meals should be served in a semi-recumbent position).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meals will be served on Days 2 and 3 at approximately the same time as on Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will not be allowed to consume the following foods or drinks within 7 days prior to&#xD;
      the first dose of study medication until after collection of the final pharmacokinetic blood&#xD;
      sample: grapefruit juice; red wine; grapefruit or cruciferous vegetables (watercress,&#xD;
      broccoli, cabbage, Brussels sprouts).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dosage and Administration One Duodart® 0.5mg/0.4mg capsule as Test formulation or one&#xD;
           Avodart® 0.5 mg and one Omnic® 0.4 mg capsules as Reference formulation will be&#xD;
           administered in the morning of Day 1 in each study period. The capsules should not be&#xD;
           opened or chewed, but swallowed whole with 200 mL of water at room temperature&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  STATISTICAL METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Population for analysis For pharmacokinetics parameters calculation and statistical&#xD;
           analysis, the data received from no less than 30 volunteers who have completed the study&#xD;
           according to the Protocol will be explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety analysis population of this study will consist of all volunteers who took part in at&#xD;
      least one study stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from volunteers who discontinued the study prematurely will be included in the final&#xD;
      report, but no included in the pharmacokinetics parameters calculation and statistical&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the volunteer has not taken any of the study drugs at all, his/her data are not to be&#xD;
      included in the statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analysis Method For pharmacokinetics parameters calculation, statistical analysis, and&#xD;
           results presentation statistical packages (Statistics, Microsoft Excel 2007, SAS, or&#xD;
           SPSS) will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will be used to present the mean value, standard deviation, median&#xD;
      value, minimal and maximal value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of variance will be done based on the assumption about the log-normal distribution&#xD;
      of AUC, Cmax, and Cmax/AUC, and normal distribution of other pharmacokinetics parameters&#xD;
      except tmax. The comparison of average values of the investigated and comparator drug&#xD;
      parameters is performed with the multiplicative model as a basis and confidence intervals&#xD;
      built for the ratio of the corresponding mean values. After the logarithmic transformation&#xD;
      these values will be analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA).&#xD;
