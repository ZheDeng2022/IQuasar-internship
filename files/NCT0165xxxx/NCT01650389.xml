      Rationale: The Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine protects children against disseminated&#xD;
      tuberculosis (TB) including TB meningitis and miliary TB, but efficacy against pulmonary TB&#xD;
      is inconsistent among children and adults. Administration of live attenuated BCG to infants&#xD;
      known to be HIV infected is contraindicated by the World Health Organization (WHO), due to&#xD;
      the risk of serious vaccine adverse events (BCG disease. Developing countries, which lack&#xD;
      capacity for integration of early infant HIV testing with infant vaccination schedules, have&#xD;
      not fully implemented the WHO guidelines on BCG vaccination of HIV exposed infants. Newborn&#xD;
      infants of HIV infected mothers continue to receive routine BCG before HIV infection has been&#xD;
      excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical trials of new viral-vectored TB vaccines, including MVA85A, a modified vaccinia&#xD;
      virus Ankara (MVA) vaccine expressing the Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigen 85A, have to&#xD;
      date enrolled infants who were already vaccinated with routine BCG at birth. However, TB&#xD;
      vaccination regimens that depend on newborn BCG will remain unsafe for HIV infected infants.&#xD;
      Infants of HIV infected mothers, who constituted 29% of babies born in South Africa in 2009,&#xD;
      would benefit from a new TB vaccination strategy, in which BCG is delayed until after HIV&#xD;
      infection has been excluded. These HIV exposed infants also have greater increased risk of TB&#xD;
      disease. Testing the safety and immunogenicity of MVA85A vaccine prime, followed by selective&#xD;
      delayed BCG boost, in HIV exposed newborns, is a critical step towards delivery of a new TB&#xD;
      vaccine regimen that is safe and effective for all infants, regardless of HIV exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Double blinded, randomised, controlled trial. HIV exposed infants will be&#xD;
      randomised 1:1 to receive single dose, intradermal MVA85A vaccine or Candin® control at&#xD;
      birth. The first 60 infants enrolled in the trial will form a pilot safety cohort for formal&#xD;
      Data Monitoring &amp; Ethics Committee (DMEC) safety review. Thereafter, safety and&#xD;
      immunogenicity outcomes will be measured in all infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: Infants (n=340) born to HIV infected mothers receiving antiretroviral&#xD;
      therapy (ART) or Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission (PMTCT) prophylaxis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sites: Worcester (University of Cape Town) and Khayelitsha (Stellenbosch University), South&#xD;
      Africa&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Intervention: Newborn infants will receive 1 x 108 pfu MVA85A vaccine or Candin®&#xD;
      control by intradermal injection. Infants confirmed HIV uninfected by HIV PCR will receive&#xD;
      BCG Vaccine SSI at 8 weeks of age. Infants confirmed HIV infected by HIV PCR will not receive&#xD;
      BCG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the safety of MVA85A given at birth to HIV exposed uninfected infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the safety of BCG given at 8 weeks of age to HIV exposed uninfected infants,&#xD;
      using an MVA85A prime and BCG boost strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the immunogenicity of MVA85A given at birth to HIV exposed uninfected infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the immunogenicity of BCG given at 8 weeks of age to HIV exposed uninfected&#xD;
      infants, using an MVA85A prime and BCG boost strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Local, regional, and systemic adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunology endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Frequencies of CD4 and CD8 T cells producing any of 4 cytokines (IL-17, IFN-γ, TNF-α, or&#xD;
      IL-2), or polyfunctional combinations of these cytokines simultaneously, following&#xD;
      stimulation with antigen Ag85A or BCG, measured by whole blood intracellular cytokine assay&#xD;
      (WB-ICS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific proliferative capacity of CD8 and CD4 T cells that produce any of the three&#xD;
      cytokines (IFN-γ, TNF-α, and/or IL-2) or combinations of these cytokines simultaneously,&#xD;
      measured by a novel whole blood 6-day lymphoproliferative flow cytometric assay (WB-prolif).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relative proportions and absolute numbers of peripheral blood myeloid and lymphoid cell&#xD;
      subsets, measured directly ex vivo by flow cytometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study groups: The first 60 infants enrolled in Study Group 1 will undergo intensive safety&#xD;
      evaluation, followed by DMEC review of Day-28 safety data. The DMEC will make a formal&#xD;
      recommendation on continuation of enrollment and/or changes to the protocol, based on this&#xD;
      safety review. Study Groups 2-5 will be evaluated for clinical safety and immunology&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis: Cumulative 12-month incidence of local, regional, and systemic AEs, by&#xD;
      category, will be compared for HIV exposed uninfected subjects receiving MVA85A vaccine or&#xD;
      Candin® control at birth. The sample size has 90% probability of detecting an SAE with a true&#xD;
      occurrence rate of 1.5% in infants receiving MVA85A vaccine and 80% power to detect a 15%&#xD;
      difference in the rate of non-serious AEs (20% compared to 35%) between the two study arms&#xD;
      (p&lt;0.05). Multivariate models will be built to explore longitudinal immunological data and&#xD;
      identify independent associations with MVA85A vaccination and covariates of interest.&#xD;
