      Background: Blood clots cause poor outcomes, including death, in babies with heart defects&#xD;
      that require a surgical connection (&quot;shunt&quot;) to provide blood flow to their lungs. Aspirin&#xD;
      (ASA) blocks the part of the blood that helps clots form (platelets). Aspirin is used in&#xD;
      babies with shunts to prevent blood clots. The dose of aspirin given to babies is based on&#xD;
      adult research. Because babies are different from adults, the investigators do not know if&#xD;
      the dose is enough to block platelets, or if it is too much and may cause bleeding. The&#xD;
      investigators can test the platelets using a blood test called Thromboelastography with&#xD;
      Platelet Mapping (TEG-PM). This test needs a small amount of blood so it can be used in&#xD;
      babies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis and Specific Aims: The investigators suspect the aspirin doses typically given&#xD;
      babies are not enough to block platelets and prevent blood clots in their shunts. The&#xD;
      investigators want to determine the percentage of babies whose platelets are not blocked&#xD;
      enough (&lt; 70% inhibition), by using TEG-PM. The investigators also want to determine how&#xD;
      often bleeding or clots occur in babies receiving aspirin.&#xD;

      Background: Aortopulmonary and cavopulmonary shunts (&quot;shunts&quot;) are surgically placed to&#xD;
      provide pulmonary blood flow in infants with congenital heart disease who require the shunt&#xD;
      for survival. Thrombosis occurs in about 17% of these shunted infants (Li et al, 2007;&#xD;
      Monagle et al, 2012) with an associated morbidity of 23% and mortality of 7%.(Li et al, 2007)&#xD;
      One study reported a third of all deaths were from shunt thrombosis.(Fenton, 2003) Despite&#xD;
      insufficient evidence to guide appropriate dosing, current thromboprophylaxis guidelines&#xD;
      recommend aspirin (ASA) for thrombus prevention in these high-risk infants. No therapeutic&#xD;
      monitoring exists to ensure consistent and effective anticoagulation and prevent&#xD;
      over-anticoagulation to minimize bleeding complications. Previous studies examining the&#xD;
      effectiveness of ASA in shunt thrombosis prevention have conflicting results. The most recent&#xD;
      large, prospective observational study showed a significant association between ASA use and&#xD;
      lower risk of thrombosis and death (Li et al, 2007), but the study was limited by lack of&#xD;
      standardized ASA dosing and failure to include adverse events. To further complicate the&#xD;
      picture, adult studies have described a phenomenon termed &quot;ASA resistance,&quot; where thrombosis&#xD;
      occurs despite ASA therapy.(Frelinger et al, 2008; Heistein et al, 2008; Szczeklik et al,&#xD;
      2005; Frelinger et al, 2006) ASA resistance has not been adequately studied in the pediatric&#xD;
      population leading to a knowledge gap between therapeutic dosing and the adequate prevention&#xD;
      of thrombosis combined with minimization of bleeding complications. Thromboelastography with&#xD;
      Platelet Mapping (TEG-PM) is a blood test that specifically evaluates the percentage of&#xD;
      inhibition of the arachidonic acid pathway targeted by ASA. It can be used for serial&#xD;
      monitoring of the adequacy of anticoagulation with ASA in shunted infants and to provide&#xD;
      evidence of safe and effective dosages for its use in other pediatric populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis and Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that ASA dosing by current guidelines (1-5&#xD;
      mg/kg/day) favors protection from bleeding complications and fails to achieve adequate&#xD;
      inhibition of the arachidonic acid pathway to prevent thrombosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: The primary aim is to determine the percentage of infants treated with ASA&#xD;
      after shunt surgery who have adequate (&gt; 70%) inhibition of the arachidonic acid pathway as&#xD;
      measured by TEG-PM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome: The percentage of arachidonic inhibition, as measured by TEG-PM, at 3 designated&#xD;
      time points after starting ASA postoperatively. Therefore, TEG-PM will be measured at these&#xD;
      designated time points:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. After the third dose of ASA&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. At the first post-operative cardiology clinic visit (between 2 and 4 weeks after&#xD;
           hospital discharge)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. At a follow-up cardiology clinic visit 3-6 months after the initiation of ASA&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: The secondary aim is to describe the frequency of bleeding and thrombotic&#xD;
      events while on ASA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome: The number of bleeding and thrombotic events from initiation of ASA therapy to end&#xD;
      of study will be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ASA administration: ASA will be initiated by the cardiac intensive care unit attending&#xD;
      physician postoperatively, at a dose of 1-5 mg/kg/day, but no less than 20 mg per day; the&#xD;
      initiation of ASA at 1-5 mg/kg/day is standard of care and recommended by the College of&#xD;
      Chest Physicians (Monagle et al, 2012), albeit with limited evidence for its use. TEG-PM&#xD;
      results obtained for research purposes will be available only to the research team. The dose&#xD;
      of ASA will not be adjusted by results from the research TEG-PM. However, if bleeding or&#xD;
      thrombosis occurs, TEG-PM is obtained by local practice and ASA dosing adjusted by the&#xD;
      treating physician. If the dose of ASA is changed while the patient is hospitalized, TEG-PM&#xD;
      will be obtained 2 hours after the third (adjusted or restarted) dose.&#xD;
