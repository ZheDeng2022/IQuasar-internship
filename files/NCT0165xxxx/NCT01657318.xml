  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators hypothesize that the use of olivamine-containing products in&#xD;
      the management of patients with compromised nonhealing lower extremity ulcers is feasible in&#xD;
      the Philippine setting. It will result in complete ulcer healing or wound closure after 16&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;

      The specific aim of this study is to assess the feasibility of using olivamine-containing&#xD;
      products in the management of patients with compromised nonhealing lower extremity ulcers in&#xD;
      the Philippines. The primary endpoint of which is to evaluate the efficacy of Olivamine on&#xD;
      healing of chronic lower extremity ulcers which will be assessed by rate of change in ulcer&#xD;
      size (wound healing trajectory) and proportion with complete ulcer healing (wound closure) at&#xD;
      4, 8, 16 and 16 weeks compared to baseline, week 0.&#xD;

        underlying factors such as peripheral arterial disease, diabetes, venous insufficiency, and&#xD;
        pressure. The ulcer must be between 1.0 cm2 and 10 cm2.&#xD;

             ulcer or surgical and traumatic wound.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient's target study ulcer/wound is a lower extremity full thickness ulcer/wound not&#xD;
             involving tendon, capsule, or bone.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient's target study ulcer/wound and is ≥1.0 cm2 and ≤ 10.0 cm2 in size at the day&#xD;
             of initial consult.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Study ulcer/wound has been present for greater than 6 weeks prior to initial consult.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with Charcot foot deformities can be entered so long as the Charcot disease&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  The patient has adequate circulation to the lower extremity as evidenced by an ABI&#xD;
             (measured by Doppler) of ≥ 0.7. If the patient has non-compressible leg arteries, as&#xD;
             documented by an ABI &gt;1.3, then the patient must have a Toe-Brachial Index be &gt; 0.6,&#xD;
             or a toe pressure &gt;50 mm Hg.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must have adequate in-home support to comply with all protocol-mandated visits&#xD;
             and procedures, offloading or pressure redistribution as required, and proper&#xD;
             application of study products and wound care regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient or his/her legal representative has read and signed the Institutional Review&#xD;
