  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out what effects a new drug AT7519M has on mantle cell&#xD;
      lymphoma.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done because AT7519M has been shown to shrink tumours in animals and&#xD;
      has been studied in a few people and seems promising but it is not clear if it can offer&#xD;
      better results than standard treatment.&#xD;

             Diagnosis of mantle cell lymphoma should be confirmed by the local institution's&#xD;
             lymphoma pathologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of clinically and/or radiologically documented disease. At least one site of&#xD;
             disease must be bidimensionally measurable using CT or MRI performed in the 3 weeks&#xD;
             prior to study enrolment. Bone lesions are not considered to be bidimensionally&#xD;
             measurable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Minimum size of at least ONE lesion must be as follows: (must be done within 21 days&#xD;

&#xD;
        MRI ≥ 1 cm x 1 cm CT scan ≥ 1 cm x 1 cm Physical exam ≥ 1 cm x 1 cm (e.g. skin lesion,&#xD;
        nodules)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a life expectancy of at least 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥ 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status of 0, 1 or 2 (see Appendix II).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous Therapy Patients must have received at least one, and up to three prior&#xD;
             systemic chemotherapy regimens (high dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell&#xD;
             support is permitted but this must be counted as one line of therapy) but must NOT&#xD;
             have shown disease progression while receiving chemotherapy or within 1 month of last&#xD;
             dose of most recent therapy (i.e. must be non-refractory).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Systemic Therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must be ≥ 4 weeks since last dose of systemic therapy (including investigational).&#xD;
        As noted, 1-3 previous chemotherapy regimens may have been given. NB: The same chemotherapy&#xD;
        combination given for first line therapy and second line therapy is considered two&#xD;
        regimens. Exceptions to the 4-week interval since last treatment are possible if prior&#xD;
        therapy is non-myelosuppressive or if any treatment-related myelosuppression has resolved.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Not permitted:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Radioactive Monoclonal Antibody Therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior treatment with AT7519M or another CDK inhibitor&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous allogeneic stem cell transplant (Note: autologous stem cell transplant is&#xD;
             permitted) Prior rituximab or bortezomib treatment is permitted, but they must be&#xD;
             counted as systemic therapy regimens if given as single agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Radiation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients may have had radiation, provided a minimum of 21 days has elapsed prior to&#xD;
        enrollment. Patients must have recovered from any acute toxic effects from radiation prior&#xD;
        to registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;

        have elapsed if surgery was major.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Laboratory Requirements: (must be done within 7 days prior to registration) Hematology&#xD;

             prior to registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be accessible for treatment and follow-up. Patients registered on this&#xD;
             trial must be treated and followed at the participating centre. This implies there&#xD;
             must be reasonable geographical limits (for example: 1 ½ hour's driving distance)&#xD;
             placed on patients being considered for this trial. Investigators must assure&#xD;
             themselves the patients registered on this trial will be available for complete&#xD;
             documentation of the treatment, adverse events, response assessment and follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In accordance with NCIC CTG policy, protocol treatment is to begin within 5 working&#xD;
             days of patient registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;

&#xD;
               4. A previous history of drug induced significant QTc prolongation (defined as a QTc&#xD;
                  interval equal to or greater than 500msec) or causing significant ECG&#xD;
                  abnormalities&#xD;
