  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators prospectively studied the results of wound closure after abdominoplasty&#xD;
      with randomized use of PrineoTM and conventional suturing to assess the possible difference&#xD;
      in outcome between these two methods.Follow-up visits to the outpatient clinic were scheduled&#xD;
      at 2 weeks, 6 months and 12 months after surgery. A panel consisting of three plastic&#xD;
      surgeons and three plastic surgery residents assessed the wound and scar appearance during&#xD;
      the three follow-up visits.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Abdominoplasty is one of the most commonly performed procedures in plastic surgery. The&#xD;
      appearance of the scar is a major factor contributing to the aesthetic outcome of the&#xD;
      procedure and depends largely on the technique of wound closure. The new PrineoTM wound&#xD;
      closure system was introduced to combine the effectiveness of 2-octyl-cyanoacrylate&#xD;
      (Dermabond TM) together with a self-adhering mesh.Fifty-two women and 8 men aged between 21&#xD;
      and 65 years scheduled for abdominoplasty were included in the study. Total operating time&#xD;
      after abdominoplasty between the traditional wound closure technique and the PrineoTM-type&#xD;
      wound closure technique was compared. Two weeks postoperatively, the wounds were examined and&#xD;
      graded according to the Hollander Cosmesis Scale. At 6- and 12-month follow-up, the aesthetic&#xD;
      outcome of the abdominal scar was evaluated with the Vancouver Scar Scale. Twelve months&#xD;
      postoperatively, the patients were further asked to score their part of the Patient Scar&#xD;
      Assessment Scale.There was a statistically significant shorter mean of total operating time&#xD;
      for the new skin closure system compared with intradermal sutures. The Hollander Cosmesis&#xD;
      Scale indicated a significantly more favourable overall result with PrineoTM at 2 weeks after&#xD;
      surgery. The Vancouver Scar Scale demonstrated a better cosmetic outcome in favour of&#xD;
      PrineoTM 6 and 12 months after surgery The Patient Scar Assessment Scale scores 12 months&#xD;
      after surgery indicated that the patients noted significantly less pain, thickness and&#xD;
      irregularity with PrineoTM.Based on our results, we conclude that PrineoTM is a safe and&#xD;
      effective substitute for superficial skin closure, with good cosmetic results and no increase&#xD;
      in wound complications. The use of PrineoTM decreases operative times and costs and enhances&#xD;
      patients' postoperative comfort.&#xD;
