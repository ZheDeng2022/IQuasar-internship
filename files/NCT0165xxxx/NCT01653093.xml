    <textblock>
      In standard clinical care, the prostate is imaged by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) which&#xD;
      is a procedure to take pictures of body structures by using a strong magnetic field and radio&#xD;
      waves. The strength of the magnet used is expressed in the unit Tesla (T); a higher Tesla&#xD;
      number means the magnet has stronger pull. Standard magnetic resonance imaging of the&#xD;
      prostate uses a magnet 1.5 Tesla strong as well as a specialized endorectal coil (antenna)&#xD;
      inserted into the body due to the limitations using an external body coil at this magnet&#xD;
      strength. MRI using a 3 Tesla magnet has a theoretical advantage over imaging at 1.5 Tesla of&#xD;
      creating a signal twice as strong that can be received by the antennas, resulting in better&#xD;
      pictures. The goal of this study is to make the MRI procedure more comfortable for patients&#xD;
      by using an external coil instead of an endorectal coil. With this study, researchers also&#xD;
      want to help patients' health care teams, the surgeons in particular. Researchers will assess&#xD;
      the impact of prostate MRI, without an endorectal coil, done at 3 Tesla and with an external&#xD;
      body coil on helping doctors decide which approaches to disease therapy might be best for&#xD;
      patients as well as correlate patients' study images with all other clinical imaging&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the impact of prostate MRI, without an endorectal coil, done at 3-Tesla on&#xD;
      surgical management. This would be performed by examining the agreement of lesion location&#xD;
      based on the MRI compared to the lesion location based on pathology and/or surgery and local&#xD;
      extent of the disease, i.e. involvement of contiguous organs and local lymph nodes, based on&#xD;
      the MRI compared to the local extent based on pathology and/or surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To test the reproducibility of functional MRI (dynamic-contrast enhanced [DCE_MRI] MRI,&#xD;
      magnetic resonance [MR] spectroscopy and diffusion-weighted MRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the usefulness of MRI data in treatment planning for radiation therapy, and to&#xD;
      test the feasibility of amide-proton-transfer MRI in prostate cancer detection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate MRI changes in prostate and tumor morphology between endorectal coil versus&#xD;
      no endorectal coil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess the usefulness of ex-vivo prostate specimen MRI for accurate co-registration&#xD;
      between in-vivo MRI of the prostate and pathology slides.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo 3-tesla (3T) MRI, including DCE-MRI, diffusion-weighted MRI,&#xD;
      amide-proton-transfer MRI, and MR spectroscopy scans. Patients may undergo an additional 3T&#xD;
      MRI scan at least 24 hours after the initial scan.&#xD;
