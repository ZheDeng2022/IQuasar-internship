  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is uncertainty about whether a live attenuated vaccine (LAIV) offers additional benefit&#xD;
      over inactivated trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) in providing indirect benefit to those who&#xD;
      are unvaccinated through herd immunity. The goal of this randomized clinical trial is to&#xD;
      determine whether immunizing children in Hutterite colonies with LAIV can provide increased&#xD;
      community-wide protection over TIV. Children aged 3 to 15 years in Hutterite colonies from&#xD;
      Alberta and Saskatchewan will be randomized to one of two regimens: TIV or LAIV. The primary&#xD;
      outcome of this study will be laboratory-confirmed influenza as detected by PCR in all&#xD;
      participants (i.e vaccine recipients and nonrecipients). Secondary outcomes will include&#xD;
      influenza-like illness, hospitalization, pneumonia, death, antibiotic use, absenteeism.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The goal of this study is to test whether immunizing children in Hutterite colonies with LAIV&#xD;
      can significantly reduce laboratory-confirmed influenza in the entire community compared to&#xD;
      TIV. We hypothesize that ≥70% uptake of LAIV compared to a similar uptake of TIV among&#xD;
      healthy children and adolescents will reduce laboratory-confirmed influenza in LAIV colonies&#xD;
      by 50% compared to TIV colonies. Other specific objectives are to determine if LAIV reduces&#xD;
      influenza in the healthy children and adolescents immunized and if LAIV reduces the following&#xD;
      relative to TIV in all participants: influenza-like illness, antimicrobial prescriptions,&#xD;
      physician-diagnosed otitis media, school or work-related absenteeism, physician visits for&#xD;
      respiratory illness, lower respiratory infection, pneumonia, hospitalizations, and death. We&#xD;
      will assess reactogenicity in both study groups.&#xD;
