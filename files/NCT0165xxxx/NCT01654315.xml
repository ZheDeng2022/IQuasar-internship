  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Of the 5.7 million stroke survivors in the United States, up to 80% exhibit significant&#xD;
      weakness in one arm (called &quot;hemiparesis&quot;). This devastating impairment undermines&#xD;
      performance of valued activities and quality of life. Although rehabilitation is commonly&#xD;
      provided, conventional affected arm rehabilitative strategies have negative evidence, or no&#xD;
      evidence, supporting their use. Thus, there remains a need for evidence-based rehabilitative&#xD;
      strategies for arm hemiparesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Newer rehabilitative approaches emphasize repetitive, task-specific practice (RTP)&#xD;
      incorporating the affected arm. However, many of these promising regimens require&#xD;
      participation in intensive therapies, and most are only efficacious on the least impaired&#xD;
      patients. Thus, there remains a need for an efficacious, practical RTP technique to address&#xD;
      moderate affected arm hemiparesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address the above shortfalls, one of the investigators team members piloted an innovative&#xD;
      brace integrating electromyography (EMG) and robotics. In his case series, 8 stroke patients&#xD;
      exhibiting moderate arm impairment successfully participated in RTP, with the brace (called&#xD;
      the &quot;Myomo&quot;) detecting and augmenting their movement attempts. Aided by the Myomo,&#xD;
      participation in the RTP regimen reduced subjects' affected arm impairment and spasticity.&#xD;
      The next logical step is to test Myomo + RTP efficacy using randomized controlled methods and&#xD;
      an appropriate sample size.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this small efficacy study is to collect randomized, controlled pilot&#xD;
      data estimating clinical effectiveness of this combined, EMG/robotics approach in conjunction&#xD;
      with RTP. A unique adjunct will be acquisition of biomechanical data as an outcome measure.&#xD;
      Based on pilot data, the central hypothesis is that Myomo therapy with RTP will exhibit&#xD;
      significant impairment reductions. We will test the central hypothesis and accomplish the&#xD;
      objective by pursuing the following specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: Compare efficacy of Myomo + RTP with RTP only and Myomo only on affected arm&#xD;
      impairment. Thirty stroke patients exhibiting moderate affected arm deficits will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to receive: (a) Myomo combined with RTP (Myomo + RTP); (b) RTP only (RTP), which&#xD;
      constitutes the most frequently used regimen in clinical environments;2,3 or (c) Myomo&#xD;
      therapy only (Myomo). The current study design will determine the additive effect of Myomo&#xD;
      training to RTP, while also discerning the relative efficacy of RTP only or Myomo use only.&#xD;
      The intended duration of contact will be equivalent across groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Affected arm impairment, the primary study outcome, will be measured by the upper extremity&#xD;
      section of the Fugl-Meyer Impairment Scale (FM), the primary outcome measure. The FM will be&#xD;
      administered by a blinded rater twice before intervention, immediately post-intervention&#xD;
      (POST), and two months post-intervention (POST-2) with POST serving as the primary study&#xD;
      endpoint. The primary study hypothesis is that subjects in the Myomo + RTP group will exhibit&#xD;
      significantly larger FM score changes than Myomo or RTP subjects at POST. It is also&#xD;
      hypothesized that these changes will be sustained at POST-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: Determine the impact of Myomo + RTP on affected arm outcomes. The&#xD;
      investigators will administer the Arm Motor Ability Test (AMAT), to all subjects before&#xD;
      intervention, at POST, and at POST-2. When compared to their scores before intervention, it&#xD;
      is hypothesized that Myomo + RTP subjects will exhibit significantly larger AMAT score&#xD;
      changes,than subjects in the other groups at POST. These differences will be sustained at&#xD;
      POST-2.&#xD;

    <description>The upper extremity section of the Fugl-Meyer Scale (FM) will assess whether changes occur in paretic upper extremity motor impairment. The FM has been used extensively in stroke recovery studies, and is highly recommended for &quot;use in clinical trials designed to evaluate changes in motor impairment following stroke.&quot; The items on the measure require the subject to perform various movements with the affected upper extremity, and each item is scored from 0 (cannot perform) to 2 (performs normally). Item are then summed for a total score. The total score ranges are 0 to 66, with a higher score representing less upper extremity impairment (and, thus, a relatively &quot;better&quot; score on the measure than a lower score).</description>

    <time_frame>Administered twice before the intervention period. These two scores are averaged to provide a composite score that is compared to average score for each group that is collected 1 week after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Arm Motor Activity Test (AMAT) was the secondary outcome for this study and was used to determine whether changes occur in activity limitation. The AMAT is a 13-item test in which valued activities are rated according to a functional ability scale that examines affected limb use 0 = no use, 1 = very slight use, 2 = slight use, 3 = moderate use, 4 = almost normal use, 5 = normal use;) and a Quality of Movement Scale (0 = no use, 1 = very poor, 2 = poor, 3 = fair, 4 = almost normal, 5 = normal. ). Therefore, the highest score that one can attain on either scale is 65.0 (which would mean that the person scored a perfect score of &quot;5&quot; on each of the thirteen items).</description>

        <title>Impairment in the Affected Upper Extremity as Measured by the Fugl Meyer Scale.</title>
        <description>The upper extremity section of the Fugl-Meyer Scale (FM) will assess whether changes occur in paretic upper extremity motor impairment. The FM has been used extensively in stroke recovery studies, and is highly recommended for &quot;use in clinical trials designed to evaluate changes in motor impairment following stroke.&quot; The items on the measure require the subject to perform various movements with the affected upper extremity, and each item is scored from 0 (cannot perform) to 2 (performs normally). Item are then summed for a total score. The total score ranges are 0 to 66, with a higher score representing less upper extremity impairment (and, thus, a relatively &quot;better&quot; score on the measure than a lower score).</description>
        <time_frame>Administered twice before the intervention period. These two scores are averaged to provide a composite score that is compared to average score for each group that is collected 1 week after intervention</time_frame>

        <title>Arm Motor Ability Test (AMAT)</title>
        <description>The Arm Motor Activity Test (AMAT) was the secondary outcome for this study and was used to determine whether changes occur in activity limitation. The AMAT is a 13-item test in which valued activities are rated according to a functional ability scale that examines affected limb use 0 = no use, 1 = very slight use, 2 = slight use, 3 = moderate use, 4 = almost normal use, 5 = normal use;) and a Quality of Movement Scale (0 = no use, 1 = very poor, 2 = poor, 3 = fair, 4 = almost normal, 5 = normal. ). Therefore, the highest score that one can attain on either scale is 65.0 (which would mean that the person scored a perfect score of &quot;5&quot; on each of the thirteen items).</description>
