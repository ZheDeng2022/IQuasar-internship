      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The brain is protected by a barrier that keeps toxins in the blood from reaching the&#xD;
           brain. However, this barrier can also keep useful medications from reaching the brain.&#xD;
           P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is a brain protein that is part of the blood-brain barrier. The&#xD;
           level of P-gp is higher in people with epilepsy than in people without epilepsy. These&#xD;
           different levels of P-gp may explain why some people have seizures that do not respond&#xD;
           well to medications. Researchers want to see if P-gp can affect the response to epilepsy&#xD;
           medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Epilepsy may also be associated with brain inflammation. Researchers also want to look&#xD;
           at the part of the brain affected by epilepsy to see if inflammation is present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To see if P-gp can affect the response to epilepsy medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To see if inflammation is present in the part of the brain affected by epilepsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  &lt;TAB&gt;Individuals between 18 and 60 years of age who have temporal lobe epilepsy. We plan&#xD;
           to study some patients whose seizures are well controlled by drugs, and some whose&#xD;
           seizures are not controlled.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  &lt;TAB&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy volunteers between 18 and 60 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study requires four or five visits to the NIH Clinical Center over the course of a&#xD;
           year. The visits will be outpatient visits and will last from 2 to 5 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine&#xD;
           samples will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All participants will have two positron emission tomography (PET) scans. The scans will&#xD;
           take place during different visits. Different drugs will be used in each scan. One drug&#xD;
           will be used to temporarily block the effect of P-gp in the brain. The other drug will&#xD;
           show areas of inflammation in the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants with epilepsy will have a third PET scan. This scan will also look at P-gp&#xD;
           activity in the brain. However, it will not use the drug that blocks the effect of P-gp.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All participants will also have one magnetic resonance imaging scan. This scan will help&#xD;
           show brain function.&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To study the role of inflammation in focal epilepsy&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To characterize the BBB state in patients with focal epilepsy using MRI, and compare the&#xD;
           results with PET imaging of inflammation&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To study test-retest replicability of [11C]PBR28 PET scanning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      50 participants with drug-resistant focal epilepsy, 25 participants with drug-responsive&#xD;
      focal epilepsy and 25 healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening of enrolled participants will include a medical history, physical exam, and blood&#xD;
      and urine laboratory testing. Blood samples will also be used for genetic polymorphism study.&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers will receive one or two brain positron emission tomography (PET) scans&#xD;
      with [11C]PBR28. Epilepsy participants will receive one or two PET scans with [11C]PBR28).&#xD;
      Everyone will receive a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Some participants will also&#xD;
      have a second MRI with gadolinium infusion to measure blood-brain barrier permeability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure will be the amount of differential [11C]PBR28 uptake between the&#xD;
      epileptic focus and the homologous contralateral region. [11C]PBR28 distribution volume (VT)&#xD;
      will be measured using an arterial input function. We want to quantify the tracer VT in&#xD;
      regions of the brain distant from the epileptic focus, which may be affected by the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that focal epilepsy will be associated with brain inflammation and, therefore,&#xD;
      that [11C]PBR28 uptake in the affected side of the brain will be higher than in the&#xD;
      contralateral side.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will study the polymorphism of the translocator protein (TSPO), because TSPO polymorphism&#xD;
      has an influence on [11C]PBR28 binding. This polymorphism is due to the non-conservative&#xD;
      amino-acid substitution at position 147 from alanine to threonine (Ala147Thr) in the fifth&#xD;
      transmembrane domain of the TSPO protein.&#xD;
