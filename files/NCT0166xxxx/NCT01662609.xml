  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out whether Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS) can detect early&#xD;
      stage pre-cancerous or cancerous changes in the pancreas in patients at high-risk for the&#xD;
      development of pancreatic cancer. Endoscopic refers to the use of an instrument called an&#xD;
      endoscope - a thin, flexible tube with a tiny video camera and light on the end. Ultrasound&#xD;
      refers to an imaging technique that uses sound waves to produce pictures. EUS in this&#xD;
      research study is a method of combining endoscopy and ultrasound imaging to obtain high&#xD;
      quality images of the pancreas.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients will be eligible if they have 2 or more relatives with pancreatic cancer and&#xD;

             cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If only 2 family members are affected then both must have had pancreatic cancer&#xD;
                  and a first-degree relationship with individual screened&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If there are more than 2 affected individuals on the same side of the family at&#xD;
                  least one of the individuals must have a first-degree relationship with the&#xD;
                  member being screened&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients at least 40 years old or 10 years younger than the youngest affected&#xD;
