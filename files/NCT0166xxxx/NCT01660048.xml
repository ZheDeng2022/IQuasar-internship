    <textblock>
      Since laparoscopic inguinal hernia was introduced in 1990, it has now become the most&#xD;
      commonly performed hernia repair in NSW. Traditionally this is done with 3 small incisions: a&#xD;
      2 cm incision under the navel for insertion of the camera and two 1 cm incisions below the&#xD;
      navel for insertion of trocars into which dissecting instruments are inserted to perform the&#xD;
      repair. Although this method has been shown to be relatively safe and efficient there are&#xD;
      reports of bowel and vascular injuries from the insertion of the smaller trocars which are&#xD;
      usually sharp. These can cause serious injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since 2009, a newer method of performing the key hole repair has been developed. This&#xD;
      involves placing a special single port under the navel via a 2-2.5cm incision and into which&#xD;
      3 blunt trocars are inserted. This negates the risks of injuries from sharp trocars. In&#xD;
      addition the fact that only a single incision is used this could potentially result in less&#xD;
      pain, reduced incidence of wound complications including infection and improved cosmetic&#xD;
      results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However these potential advantages have not been proven in rigorous clinical studies as the&#xD;
      single port technique is still relatively new. It is hoped that this study will prove that&#xD;
      the single port technique is at least as effective and efficient as the conventional&#xD;
      technique in the cure of hernias and may have additional benefits as enumerated above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neither you nor your surgeon will know which procedure (three port or single port hernia&#xD;
      repair) until you are already asleep in the operating room and a random number selecting&#xD;
      process will automatically assign you to one procedure or the other. Sometimes it is not&#xD;
      possible to perform the single port safely in which case your procedure will be converted to&#xD;
      a three ports procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients having surgical treatment of groin hernia at Holroyd Private Hospital are&#xD;
      subject to very careful assessment and study. All patients are requested to report&#xD;
      immediately if there are any problems. Any problems would normally be reported to your&#xD;
      treating surgeon who has primary responsibility for your care. Problems can be reported&#xD;
      directly to Holroyd Private Hospital. Any information in your medical records is subject to&#xD;
      stringent confidentiality requirements. The hospital is bound by the Australian Privacy&#xD;
      Council Charter as regards confidentiality and privacy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study will compare the Laparoscopic TEP repair of inguinal/femoral hernias using the&#xD;
      traditional three ports and the newer single port techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laparoscopic hernia repair was first introduced in 1990. The uptake rate was slow to start&#xD;
      off with such that in 1994 only 9.7% of all inguinal hernias were performed laparoscopically&#xD;
      However, in 2009, the figure now stands at 40% Australia-wide.&#xD;
      (www.medicareaustralia.gov.au). Indeed, in NSW this figure stands at 48%, which means that it&#xD;
      is the commonest operation performed for inguinal hernias in this State.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 2009, the laparoscopic hernia repair involves the insertion of 3 ports: 10mm port in&#xD;
      the infra-umbilical region for the camera via a 2 cm incision and 2 x 5mm working ports&#xD;
      usually in the midline for the dissecting instruments via 2 x 10mm incisions. These ports are&#xD;
      called secondary trocars which are usually sharp. Their insertion has the potential to cause&#xD;
      bowel and vascular injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The European Hernia Society guidelines (www.herniaweb.org) on the treatment of inguinal&#xD;
      hernias have shown (conventional) endoscopic techniques to be associated with higher rates of&#xD;
      port-site hernias and visceral injuries especially during the learning curve period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent study of 37,000 gynaecological laparoscopies in the US showed a bowel injury rate of&#xD;
      0.16%; a third of these led to the death of the patients. 22% of all bowel injuries resulted&#xD;
      from the insertion of secondary trocars&#xD;
      (www.danaise.com/vascular_and_bowel_injuries_duri.htm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another report from a large hernia centre in the US showed that in the first 300&#xD;
      transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) repairs 2 bowel injuries (and one bladder injury) were&#xD;
      observed. Indeed, when these investigators changed the technique to a TEP repair they also&#xD;
      observed 2 bowel injuries (and one bladder injury) in the first 300 TEP repairs.&#xD;
      (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11178763)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore bowel and vascular injuries during laparoscopic surgery are real but they are often&#xD;
      under reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single incision laparoscopic surgery, where all the instruments are placed in a single port,&#xD;
      has the primary aim of preventing vascular and bowel injury through the use of completely&#xD;
      blunt trocars. The first case of laparoscopic TEP repair was reported in 2009. Since then&#xD;
      there have only been a handful of reports.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principle author, Dr Hanh Tran, has been performing single incision laparoscopic hernia&#xD;
      repair since October 2009. To date, he has performed in excess of 100 cases with excellent&#xD;
      results in terms of success of the cure of hernias (no recurrence has been observed in any of&#xD;
      these patients although the follow-up has only been up to 1 year), no complications including&#xD;
      wound infection, high patient satisfaction and excellent cosmetic results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However Dr Tran's experience is at best an audit. The highest level of scientific evidence&#xD;
      regarding the efficacy and safety of one procedure versus another comes from a prospective&#xD;
      randomised controlled study where two procedures are compared and the patients (with their&#xD;
      informed consent) will undergo either procedure in a random (blind) fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is proposed that 100 patients will be enrolled into the study with 50 patients in each arm&#xD;
      of the study ie 50 patients will undergo TEP repair using the conventional three ports and 50&#xD;
      with the single port technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TEP inguinal hernia repair is exactly the same in both procedures except in the single&#xD;
      port technique only one (1.5-2cm) infra-umbilical incision is required. While the first 100&#xD;
      cases were performed with the SILS (TM) port this required a relatively larger infraumbilical&#xD;
      incision. The availability of the Triport (TM) allows an equally small if not smaller&#xD;
      infraumbilical incision and this would be suited to all patients rather than those with a&#xD;
      naturally large umbilicus. Over 180 TEP inguinal hernia repairs were performed with the&#xD;
      Triport before the commencement of the trial to ensure that the learning curve has been truly&#xD;
      passed. Therefore the use of the Triport allows for just one inconspicuous incision compared&#xD;
      to three incisions for the conventional multiport inguinal hernia repair with possible&#xD;
      improved cosmetic results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main disadvantage of the single port technique is the relative loss of triangulation and&#xD;
      the principle author has shown that this can be overcome with the use of a longer and smaller&#xD;
      laparoscope (of which Holroyd Private Hospital has bought two specifically for this purpose),&#xD;
      different dissecting techniques and with increased experience. Therefore, if a surgeon is not&#xD;
      experienced with this technique the operation and its success can be compromised by&#xD;
      inadequate dissection. The author (who has performed nearly 2000 TEP repairs over the past 10&#xD;
      years) believes that the learning curve for single port TEP hernia repair for a highly&#xD;
      experienced TEP surgeon is around 25-50 ie after this number the operation time will approach&#xD;
      that of the standard three ports TEP repair. He has performed in excess of 100 Single Port&#xD;
      Incision Laparoscopic hernia repairs over the past year. Therefore the success of the&#xD;
      operation for patients in either arm of the study will not be compromised by lack of&#xD;
      experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The follow up of these patients will be no different to those followed up under the protocol&#xD;
      of the Sydney Hernia Clinic. This is a standard follow up and is consistent with normal&#xD;
      clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, the goals are simple. (i) To perform laparoscopic TEP inguinal hernia repair&#xD;
      using either the conventional three ports or single port technique; (ii) To assess the&#xD;
      efficacy of the newer single port technique in a rigorous scientific manner; (iii) To report&#xD;
      any unexpected problems or complications; (iv) To follow up patients treated laparoscopically&#xD;
      to ensure that the single port technique has as good results as or better in terms of cure of&#xD;
      hernia (absence of recurrence of the hernia) and less complications and better cosmetic&#xD;
      results as that which is achieved when the traditional 3-ports technique is used.&#xD;
