  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with acute respiratory failure exhibiting decreased respiratory system compliance&#xD;
      with hypoxemia or carbon dioxide retention are often difficult to ventilate with current&#xD;
      guidelines that limit applied plateau pressure Yet, these guidelines do not take into&#xD;
      consideration chest wall mechanics. The investigators sought to determine whether partition&#xD;
      of the respiratory system into its components by measuring esophageal pressure and thus&#xD;
      assessment of pleural pressure, would help in patients with acute respiratory failure to&#xD;
      identify the factors contributing to low respiratory system compliance.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Identifying the dominant factor affecting respiratory system compliance by measuring&#xD;
      transpulmonary pressure may better direct and optimize mechanical ventilation. Thus, instead&#xD;
      of limiting mechanical ventilation by plateau pressure, PEEP and Inspiratory pressure&#xD;
      adjustment would be individualized specifically for each patient's lung compliance as&#xD;
      indicated by transpulmonary pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main goal of this approach is to specifically target transpulmonary pressure instead of&#xD;
      plateau pressure, and therefore achieve the best Lung compliance with the least&#xD;
      transpulmonary pressure possible.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  To be included in the study a prerequisite of high peak Inspiratory pressure (plateau&#xD;
             pressure of up to 30 cmH2O) had to be present, and at least one of the following four&#xD;
             inclusion criteria had to be met.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1 - Low Total Respiratory system compliance (CT), defined as less than 50ml/cmH2O. 2 -&#xD;
             P/F ratio of less than 300. 3 - Need for a PEEP greater than 10 cmH2O to maintain SaO2&#xD;
             of &gt; 90%. 4 - PCO2 over 60 mmHg, or PH less than 7.2 that is attributed to respiratory&#xD;
             acidosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with any of the following were excluded from the study. Previous lung or&#xD;
             chest wall surgery, previous esophageal surgery, known Achalasia or any other&#xD;
             esophageal motility or spasm disorder, presence of chest thoracostomy tube, and any&#xD;
             significant chest wall abnormality such as kyphoskoliosis.&#xD;
