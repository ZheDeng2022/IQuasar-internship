      The purpose of this study is to collect blood samples to enable validation of genetic testing&#xD;
      for diseases within a multi-disease carrier screening panel. Samples will be collected from&#xD;
      adult women or men who have previously tested positive as carriers for various recessive&#xD;
      conditions. These are healthy adults who carry a mutation that might place them at increased&#xD;
      risk of having a child with a specific genetic disorder. Study participation will be open to&#xD;
      adults that were previously tested as part of their routine medical care and where test&#xD;
      results demonstrated positive carrier status for a specific genetic disease. Samples will be&#xD;
      tested for the disease mutation for which the subjects provides documentation of prior&#xD;
      testing.&#xD;
