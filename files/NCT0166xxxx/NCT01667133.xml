    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of ponatinib in Japanese&#xD;
      patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) who have experienced failure of dasatinib or&#xD;
      nilotinib or with Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) following failure of prior tyrosine&#xD;
      kinase inhibitors (TKIs).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This multi-center, phase 1/2, open-label study will consist of two phases. The first will be&#xD;
      a dose escalation phase employing a modified 3+3 design with two dose cohorts (30mg and&#xD;
      45mg). After 6 patients complete the first cycle in a cohort, safety events will be evaluated&#xD;
      before opening the next dose cohort. Patients will continue on treatment as long as it is&#xD;
      tolerated and disease progression has not occurred. Phase 2 will occur at the recommended&#xD;
      dose determined in phase 1 in an additional 25 patients. Another 3 patients will be dosed at&#xD;
      15mg for collection of pharmacokinetic data. These patients may also escalate to the&#xD;
      recommended dose and be assessed for efficacy and safety as phase 2 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy measures include molecular, cytogenetic, and hematologic response rates at various&#xD;
      time points; time to response; duration of response; and survival follow-up. Safety measures&#xD;
      include routine physical and laboratory evaluations, adverse event monitoring, and ECGs.&#xD;
      Other measures include mutation testing and molecular genetic assessment. Accrual is expected&#xD;
      to take approximately 12 months, and patients will be followed for survival for up to 60&#xD;
      months from the last dose of study drug; therefore, the estimated duration of the trial is 72&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
