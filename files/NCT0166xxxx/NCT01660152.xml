  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine which technique in using a vacuum erection device&#xD;
      (VED) is best. Erectile dysfunction (ED) after robotic prostate cancer surgery is a concern&#xD;
      for both the surgeon and the patient. Recent studies have shown that beginning to use the&#xD;
      vacuum pump on a daily basis starting with in 2-8 weeks may help prevent the start of penile&#xD;
      shrinkage. This is a potential issue that can occur because of decreased blood flow after&#xD;
      prostate cancer surgery. This study will allow researchers to determine and compare vacuum&#xD;
      therapy techniques and erectile function outcomes of patients who have prostate cancer&#xD;
      surgery&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine sexual function and penile morphometric outcomes for the post-robotic-assisted&#xD;
      laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) patients undergoing daily vacuum therapy using one of two&#xD;
      randomized methods and whether these outcomes differ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Compare compliance rates between the two randomized groups using the compliance&#xD;
      questionnaire and a diary collected from patients at each follow up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Compare overall patient satisfaction with the recovery procedure between the two&#xD;
      randomized groups utilizing the SHIM (Sexual Health Inventory for Men) questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP A: Patients receive vacuum therapy daily over 10 minutes while holding erection for 2&#xD;
      minutes after undergoing RALP. Patients complete erection process 5 times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP B: Patients receive vacuum therapy daily over 10 minutes while holding erection for 5&#xD;
      minutes after undergoing RALP. Patients complete erection process 2 times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3, 6, and 12 months.&#xD;
