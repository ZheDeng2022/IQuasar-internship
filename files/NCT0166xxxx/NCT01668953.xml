  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      &quot;Tennis elbow&quot; is the most common cause of lateral elbow pain, generally caused by either&#xD;
      work or sports related repetitive strain. In this condition, a tendon along the outside of&#xD;
      the elbow becomes inflamed leading to pain, especially with flexing and extending the elbow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many treatments have been attempted, including physiotherapy and steroids, with little&#xD;
      success. One treatment which has been very effective is the injection of the patients own&#xD;
      blood (taken from their other non-affected arm) into their abnormal tendon. The blood&#xD;
      recruits the patients own healing factors and heals the damaged tendon. As platelets are&#xD;
      thought to be largely responsible, injection of concentrated platelets, extracted from the&#xD;
      patient's blood (platelet rich plasma) is a newer, but expensive, technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At this point, it is unclear whether whole blood, concentrated platelets, or simply passing a&#xD;
      ultrasound-guided needle through the abnormal tendon as a means to stimulate tissue healing&#xD;
      (tendon fenestration) is the better treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this trial is to compare platelet rich plasma, whole blood, dry needle&#xD;
      tendon fenestration, and sham injection (with physical therapy) to identify the best and most&#xD;
      cost-effective therapy for this debilitating condition.&#xD;

    <description>The subcutaneous soft tissues of the lateral elbow will be infiltrated with 1% lidocaine for local anesthetic.&#xD;
A 22-gauge needle will then be placed into the tendon followed by 15-25 gentle strokes of dry needling in which the needle pierces the tendon at multiple sites.&#xD;
For the PRP preparation, the Arthrex ACP system will be used. This is a closed, double syringe system which uses 16 mL of whole blood drawn from the patient's contralateral arm, using a 19G butterfly needle. The blood is centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 5 minutes and extracts 4-7 ml of PRP. No anticoagulant will be used.&#xD;
Fenestration of the tendon will continue as 3mL of PRP is injected into the common extensor tendon.&#xD;
The remaining PRP will be sent for analysis of platelet, WBC, and RBC concentrations.</description>
