      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vascular closure devices (VCD) were developed to reduce access site bleedings, to improve&#xD;
      patients´ comfort, and to accelerate ambulation after percutaneous coronary interventions&#xD;
      (PCI). Despite higher complications rates in earlier studies, current data suggest similar&#xD;
      complication rates or better outcomes after the use of VCD as compared to manual compression.&#xD;
      ExoSeal (Cordis, Warren, NJ, USA) is a new, extravascular polyglycol acid (PGA) plug which&#xD;
      occludes the puncture channel. Whether the use of this extravascular closure device is as&#xD;
      effective as the more widely used plug/anchor mediated devices, has not been evaluated so&#xD;
      far.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We performed a randomized, multicentre, single-blinded trial to compare the efficacy of the&#xD;
      extravascular closure device ExoSeal in comparison to the collagen-based plug/anchor mediated&#xD;
      AngioSeal system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      304 patients receiving diagnostic angiography and/or PCI will be included in three centers.&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria are contraindications for any VCD including 1. severe calcification of the&#xD;
      access vessel, 2. severe peripheral artery disease, 3. puncture in the origin of the profound&#xD;
      femoral artery, 3. non-femoral sheath insertion, 4. marked tortuosity of the femoral or iliac&#xD;
      artery, 5. marked obesity or cachexia (BMI &gt;40 or &lt;20) and 6. patients on continuous&#xD;
      medication with oral anticoagulants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the procedure, angiography of the accessed femoral artery is performed to rule out&#xD;
      major risk factors for retroperitoneal hemorrhage, relevant peripheral stenoses of the common&#xD;
      or the superficial femoral artery, or a location of the puncture site in the bifurcation of&#xD;
      the profundal femoral artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesise, that the use of an extravascular closure device is not inferior to an&#xD;
      anchor/plug mediated device regarding the occurrence of the following complications:&#xD;
      bleeding, need for vascular surgery and device failure (primary endpoints). Secondary&#xD;
      endpoints are the occurrence of false aneurysms, severe pain (Borg ≥ 5), and hematoma ≥ 5 cm&#xD;
      within 24 hours after insertion of the device. Power was 80%, alpha 0.05. Bleeding will be&#xD;
      defined according to the TIMI criteria. The study is actively enrolling patients, last&#xD;
      inclusion will take place in September 2012.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results and Conclusions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome data including the primary endpoint (bleeding, need for vascular surgery and device&#xD;
      failure) will be presented for the first time.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Introduction In patients undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) there is a rate&#xD;
      of vascular complications of 0.8% to 5.5% (1). Albeit femoral sheaths sizes were reduced,&#xD;
      arterial compression and long-term dressing after PCI still bear tremendous discomfort and&#xD;
      groin pain for the patients. Furthermore, manual compression of the puncture site should be&#xD;
      performed until activated clotting time is below 180 seconds (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, vascular closure devices (VCD) were developed to reduce access site bleedings, to&#xD;
      improve patients´ comfort, and to accelerate ambulation after PCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hemostatic puncture closure device Angio-Seal (St. Jude Medical, St. Paul, MS, USA) is a&#xD;
      collagen based plug system with an anchor in the inner vessel wall. ExoSeal (Cordis, Warren,&#xD;
      NJ, USA) is a extravascular polyglycol acid (PGA) plug, which closes the puncture site on an&#xD;
      extravascular basis while occluding the puncture channel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the current, randomized study is, to evaluate the effectiveness, safety and&#xD;
      reliability of 2 different vascular closure devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Consecutive patients with stable angina pectoris or silent ischemia with a positive&#xD;
      stress test will be randomized to either Angio-Seal or Exo-Seal, and included into the study&#xD;
      after giving written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with contraindications for any VCD including 1. severe calcifications of the vessel&#xD;
      site, 2. severe peripheral artery disease, 3. puncture in the origin of the femoral profundal&#xD;
      artery, 3. non-femoral sheath insertion, 4. marked tortuosity of the femoral or iliac artery,&#xD;
      and 5. marked obesity (BMI &gt;40) or 6. cachexia (BMI &lt;20) will be excluded from the study (3).&#xD;
      As clinical exclusion criteria will serve: 1. any emergency intervention, 2. the use of&#xD;
      Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa-antagonists during the intervention, and 3. patients on continuous&#xD;
      medication with oral anticoagulants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be loaded with either 300 mg or 600 mg of Clopidogrel or 60 mg of Prasugrel&#xD;
      or 180 mg of Ticagrelor, followed by a maintenance dose of 75 mg or 150 mg of Clopidogrel or&#xD;
      5 mg or 10 mg of Prasugrel, or 90 mg of Ticagrelor prior to the intervention. After insertion&#xD;
      of a 6 F sheath, unfractionated Heparin (UF) will be given until an activated clotting&#xD;
      time-level (ACT) of 250 s will be achieved. The use of low -molecular weight Heparin (LMWH)&#xD;
      according to the recommendations of the manufacturers for the purpose of anticoagulation&#xD;
      during PCI is possible. The simultaneous use of UF and LMWH should be avoided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients should receive PCI according to standard protocols (8). After the procedure, an&#xD;
      angiography of the accessed femoral artery should be performed to rule out major risk factors&#xD;
      for retroperitoneal hemorrhage, relevant peripheral stenoses of the common or the superficial&#xD;
      femoral artery, or a location of the puncture site in the bifurcation of the profundal&#xD;
      femoral artery (9). In addition, this method will identify patients with a non-femoral artery&#xD;
      sheath insertion, for which the VCD utilization is not proven (10). Patients with strong&#xD;
      tortuosity and/or calcification of the femoral arteries should also be excluded from the&#xD;
      study (see exclusion criteria).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Towards the end of the intervention the ACT should be recorded again: Angio-Seal or ExoSeal&#xD;
      may be implanted when ACT is &lt; 300s. In patients randomized to manual compression with or&#xD;
      without patch the sheath should be removed when the ACT is &lt; 180s.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of protamine is left to the discretion of the operator. In patients randomized to&#xD;
      either Angio-Seal or Exo-Seal the placement should be performed using the manufacturer´s&#xD;
      recommended technique. The operator should be familiar with any device used in the study, and&#xD;
      should have performed vascular closure with those devices at least fifty times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After insertion of the VCD a circular groin dressing will be applied, and patients will be&#xD;
      immobilized for 4 hours. After this, the arterial puncture site will be examined, and&#xD;
      auscultation will be performed. If there is no relevant complication, ambulation will be&#xD;
      initiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain during closure procedure or manual compression will be categorized according to the Borg&#xD;
      scale, with minor pain defined as Borg &lt; 5 and major pain as Borg ≥ 5 (13).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with manual compression with or without patch, immobilization will last 8 hours.&#xD;
      After this, inspection of the puncture site will be performed as mentioned above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticoagulation either with unfractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparin will be&#xD;
      restarted 6 hours after resolution of the dressing. On the subsequent day, ultrasound and&#xD;
      Doppler spectral analysis of the puncture site will be performed in all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complications will be assessed as being major or minor: Major complications are defined as&#xD;
      need for vascular surgery, false aneurysm, AV-fistula, strong pain (Borg ≥ 5), hematoma ≥ 5&#xD;
      cm and major bleeding, whereas minor pain, hematoma &lt; 5 cm and new wound dressing will be&#xD;
      classified as minor complications. Bleeding will be identified as bleeding according to the&#xD;
      TIMI criteria (12). TIMI major bleeding is defined as hemoglobin drop &gt; 5 g/dl (with or&#xD;
      without an identified site), TIMI &quot;loss no site&quot; as a haemoglobin drop &gt; 4 g/dl but &lt; 5 g/dl&#xD;
      without an identified bleeding site, and TIMI minor bleeding as a hemoglobin drop &gt; 3 g/dl&#xD;
      but &lt; 5 g/dl with bleeding from a known site or spontaneous gross hematuria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Again pain will be categorized according to the Borg scale, with minor pain defined as Borg &lt;&#xD;
      5 and major pain as Borg ≥ 5 (13).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic and procedural data will be prospectively collected using a standardized&#xD;
      procedural data sheet. This includes date and type of intervention, sheath size,&#xD;
      procedure-related drug doses, and number of previous interventions. Major or minor&#xD;
      complications, as well as the time of events will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Randomization will be performed Statistical analyses will be performed&#xD;
      with SPSS version 16.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Continuous data are expressed as mean&#xD;
      values +/- standard deviation. For comparisons between paired data the students t-test will&#xD;
      be used. A p-value &lt; 0.05 will be regarded as statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk-benefit ratio Achieving adequate hemostasis is crucial for the prevention of access site&#xD;
      complications in patients undergoing PCI (3). The occurrence of vascular complications was an&#xD;
      independent predictor of nonfatal myocardial infarction or death within one year after&#xD;
      intervention (14), and has been associated with a significant increase in mortality (15).&#xD;
      Advanced age, female gender, pre-existing vascular disease, emergent procedures, low body&#xD;
      surface area (4, 8, 14), diabetes, hypertension, and cigarette smoking (15, 16) are also&#xD;
      associated with an increased bleeding risk. Therefore adequate hemostasis still remains a&#xD;
      challenge in interventional cardiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recently introduced extravascular closure device ExoSeal theoretically offer some&#xD;
      advantages. First, there is no foreign body, which is introduced into the artery, which, once&#xD;
      misplaced potentially can lead to an occlusion of the artery, or to inflammation or allergic&#xD;
      reactions. In addition to that , those devices might be used in patients with common&#xD;
      contraindications for VCD´s like calcification, peripheral artery disease and tortuosity of&#xD;
      the artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since these devices are already introduced, but not evaluated sufficiently, there is need for&#xD;
      a randomized comparison with an established system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risk-benefit ratio is well on the site of benefit, since all devices are regularly used&#xD;
      in interventional cardiology and the estimated complication rate is in the range or even&#xD;
      lower, than those, reported in the literature.&#xD;
