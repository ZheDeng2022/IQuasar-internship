  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of the study is that tomato extracted lycopene will be able to decrease&#xD;
      postprandial oxidation and inﬂammation in healthy weight men and women when compared to&#xD;
      Placebo.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Consumption of a high-fat meal results in a postprandial (fed-state) response characterized&#xD;
      by hypertriglyceridemia. Postprandial hypertriglyceridemia increases the oxidation of&#xD;
      low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and increases blood concentrations of several biomarkers of&#xD;
      inﬂammation. This postprandial lipemia-induced oxidative stress mediated response to a&#xD;
      high-fat meal has been suggested as a major contributor to the pathogenesis of&#xD;
      atherosclerosis along with other chronic disease states of diabetes and obesity. Consumption&#xD;
      of foods rich in antioxidant compounds provides a defence source to compliment endogenous&#xD;
      defence systems to protect against oxidative damage during pro-oxidant conditions.&#xD;
