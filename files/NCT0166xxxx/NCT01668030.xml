    <textblock>
      Forty percent of patients admitted to the contributing regional burn unit over a five month&#xD;
      period received facial burns (n=14). The purpose of this study is to examine if the time&#xD;
      until a granulation bed is well established can be decreased be using an enzymatic agent,&#xD;
      when compared to a second standard ointment, for patients with partial-thickness facial&#xD;
      burns. The current study will use a prospective, experimental study design in which each&#xD;
      individual will be their own matched control. That is, each individual will receive both the&#xD;
      experimental ointment (one-side of the face) and the standard ointment (other-side of the&#xD;
      face). Outcomes measured will be the benefits (e.g., decreased in the time until granulation&#xD;
      bed establishment) one ointment achieves in partial-thickness facial burns when compared to a&#xD;
      second ointment. Exploratory analyses will examine the relationships among demographic&#xD;
      variables, granulation bed establishment time, pain, anxiety, itching, and scarring. That is,&#xD;
      testing whether the time until granulation establishment may be associated with an&#xD;
      individual's demographic variables, treatment type, pain, anxiety, itching levels, and&#xD;
      scarring. Significance for all analysis will be at the 0.05 level. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that promoting rapid granulation bed establishment will decrease hospital length&#xD;
      of stays, costs, risk of infection, and possibly associated appearance changes. The results&#xD;
      from the current study will provide preliminary findings for a future, more sophisticated&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Rapid wound healing in burn injuries advances wound closure, and decreases opportunities for&#xD;
      infection and scarring (Hansbrough, Achauer, Dawson, et al., 1995; Soroff &amp; Sasvary, 1994);&#xD;
      also leading to a shorter length of stays (LOS). Decreased LOS in the hospital supported by&#xD;
      rapid wound closure facilitates reentry to the home and work environments should lead to a&#xD;
      reduction in the costs associated with hospitalization. In addition, for patients with facial&#xD;
      burns, rapid granulation bed establishment may decrease associated appearance changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use of an enzymatic agent has been described in only three studies (Hansbrough, Achauer,&#xD;
      Dawson, et al., 1995; Soroff &amp; Sasvary, 1994; Varma, Bugatch, &amp; German 1973). Treatment an&#xD;
      enzymatic agent resulted in shorter time to achieve a clean wound bed and significantly more&#xD;
      rapid wound healing when compared to controls or other agents for 94 patients with&#xD;
      non-facial, partial-thickness burns (Hansbrough, Achauer, Dawson, et al.; Soroff &amp; Sasvary).&#xD;
      Twenty patients with dermal ulcers treated with an enzmatic agent, when compared to placebo&#xD;
      controls, showed significantly decreased pus, odor, necrosis, and inflammation (Varma,&#xD;
      Bugatch, &amp; German, 1973). There was a relative reduction in wound size almost reaching&#xD;
      significance (p&lt;0.07) for those patients with dermal ulcers too.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Though an enzymatic agent is without purported antibiotic properties, a rapid reduction in&#xD;
      bacterial burden in wounds has been shown in animal models (Payne, Salas, Ko, Naidu, Donate,&#xD;
      Wright et al., 2008). The bacterial burden decreased rapidly in scald burn wounds to achieve&#xD;
      a bacterial balance for 15 rats with E-coli infected wounds when compared with saline-treated&#xD;
      controls to &lt;105 colony forming units/gram of tissue (p &lt; .05).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have suggested that the exploratory variables being collected are associated&#xD;
      with shorter healing times and lower infection rates. Whether these differences are actually&#xD;
      due to some other mediating/moderating factor (gender-specific enzyme or hormone&#xD;
      concentrations, gene interaction, metabolism, etc) and not the exploratory variables is&#xD;
      unclear and not empirically established. A future, larger study will hopefully more fully&#xD;
      explore these relationships. However, to justify the more detailed investigations will&#xD;
      require showing differences at the more crude level. Unfortunately, to date there has been no&#xD;
      research examining the potential benefits of using collagenase in patients with facial burn&#xD;
      injuries. As a result, the aims of this study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Show the benefit (e.g., decreased time until the granulation bed is well established,&#xD;
           shorter time until wound closure) an enzymatic agent achieves in partial-thickness&#xD;
           facial burns when compared to a common antibacterial agent;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Investigate the interrelationships among demographic variables, treatment, pain,&#xD;
           anxiety, and itch;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Explore whether time to granulation bed establishment can be predicted from treatment;&#xD;
           when adjusting for demographic variables, pain, anxiety, and itch levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Examine the long-term scarring and social experience of persons with facial burns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: A prospective, experimental study design in which each individual will be their own&#xD;
      matched control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure. Within 24 hours of burn unit admission, patients or their spouses, or guardians&#xD;
      will be asked regarding study participation. Upon patient agreement, and signing the&#xD;
      institutional review board approved informed consent form, HIPAA Research Authorization, a&#xD;
      demographic information form will be completed and wound culture results obtained (if&#xD;
      ordered).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be randomized into receiving either bacitracin or collagenase to the right&#xD;
      side of the face (ointment one). Ointment two will be applied to the left side of the face.&#xD;
      Treatment of the partial-thickness facial burns will be performed by the nurses on the burn&#xD;
      unit according to burn unit protocol. Therefore, each person will serve as their own matched&#xD;
      control, thus reducing the sample size required to achieve sufficient power for the study by&#xD;
      reducing deviance between cases and control (i.e., age, pain, itch, size of burn, and&#xD;
      scarring). Also, this type of study design will allow us to achieve valid, reliable results&#xD;
      with fewer individuals. This is a typical study design for similar ointment and eye drops&#xD;
      studies. The bridge of the nose will be used as a guide to divide the face in half&#xD;
      lengthwise. The wound will be cleansed and dressed twice daily. Treatment will continue until&#xD;
      the granulation bed is well established. Daily ratings of pain, anxiety, and itch will be&#xD;
      obtained at each morning dressing change. Digital photographs of only the facial burn will be&#xD;
      taken weekly and at the first outpatient visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient confidentiality will be maintained by assigning participants a random, unique, study&#xD;
      identification number that cannot be linked directly to any individual. This random number&#xD;
      will be used in all study data sets for data management and data analysis. Signed (approved)&#xD;
      informed consent forms will be kept in a locked file in the principle investigator's office.&#xD;
      The research data sets will be stored on a university secured computer drive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Digital photographs will be identified by patient number. These photographs will be rated by&#xD;
      burn wound experts recruited from a posting on the American Burn Association web site (e.g.&#xD;
      nurses and/or physical therapists certified in wound care with a minimum of 5 years'&#xD;
      experience). Patients' records will also be assessed weekly as to whether any patient on&#xD;
      study has a wound or blood infection confirmed by a positive laboratory culture. Those&#xD;
      patients with confirmed positive cultures will be dropped from the study. Patient pain,&#xD;
      anxiety, and itch scoring will be obtained and recorded by the nurses caring for patients on&#xD;
      the burn unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of scarring will be obtained at the first out-patient visit by both the healthcare&#xD;
      provider and patient. For the three and six month follow-ups, every effort will be made to&#xD;
      have both the health care provider and patient assessments, however, it may not always be&#xD;
      possible to have the patient return to the hospital (e.g., costs associated with travel and&#xD;
      missing work) so the patient's assessment will be obtained via telephone. Assessment of the&#xD;
      social experience will be obtained by completing the two instruments and open-ended questions&#xD;
      either in-person or through a telephone interview at the first out-patient visit, at three&#xD;
      and six months after injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instrumentation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain and Anxiety. Physician ordered analgesic and anxiety therapy will be provided per&#xD;
      patient request prior to each dressing change. At each morning dressing change, patients will&#xD;
      rate their perception of pain and anxiety, separately, with a 10-point visual analogue scale&#xD;
      (where 1= no pain, or anxiety and 10= the most possible) at three time points. These times&#xD;
      will be: prior to cleansing and debridement, at completion of the dressing change, and 30&#xD;
      minutes after treatment. The Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale (RASS) will be used with&#xD;
      non-verbal patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale (RASS). Inter-rater reliability in 290-paired&#xD;
      observations by nurses, results of both the RASS demonstrated excellent inter-rater&#xD;
      reliability (weighted kappa, 0.91 and 0.94, respectively) (Ely, Truman, Shintani, et al.,&#xD;
      2003). Criterion validity was tested in 411-paired observations in the first 96 patients of&#xD;
      the validation cohort, in whom the RAS showed significant differences between levels of&#xD;
      consciousness (P&lt;.001 for all) and correctly identified fluctuations within patients over&#xD;
      time (P&lt;.001). Face validity was demonstrated via a survey of 26 critical care nurses, which&#xD;
      the results showed that 92% agreed or strongly agreed with the RASS scoring scheme, and 81%&#xD;
      agreed or strongly agreed that the instrument provided a consensus for goal-directed delivery&#xD;
      of medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Itch. Physician ordered itch therapy (e.g., Benadryl, Atarax, or Claritin) will be provided&#xD;
      per patient request prior to each dressing change. At each morning dressing change, patients&#xD;
      will rate their perception of itch with a 10-point visual analogue scale (where 1=no itch and&#xD;
      10=the most possible), at three time points. These times will be: prior to cleansing and&#xD;
      debridement, at completion of the dressing change, and 30 minutes after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scarring. Scarring will be measured by two instruments [The Patient and Observer Scar&#xD;
      Assessment Scale (POSAS)] developed by Draaijers, Tempelman, Botman, et al. (2004) and&#xD;
      further tested by Van de kar, Corion, Smeulders, et al. (2005. These two instruments, one for&#xD;
      the health care provider and the second for the patient, recognizes the need for both the&#xD;
      professional's and patient-based need for scar assessment, whereas, the Vancouver Scar Scale&#xD;
      (VSS) only assesses scar severity from the professional's viewpoint. Though the VSS has been&#xD;
      accepted and used as a scar assessment tool, there is not evidence to suggest it is the &quot;gold&#xD;
      standard&quot; measure of burns scarring, and additionally, it does not include the patient's&#xD;
      perception of their scarring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The POSAS has items assessing vascularity, pigmentation, thickness, relief and pliability,&#xD;
      rated on a 10-point numeric scale, with normal skin and worst scar used as end labels. Items&#xD;
      on the patient scale directly correspond to theses except for scar color. Patients are asked&#xD;
      to rate their itchiness and scar pain. A ten-point numeric scale is used (1=no complaints&#xD;
      /normal skin, 10=worst imaginable/very different). Individual items are summed with higher&#xD;
      scores representing poorer scars and lower scores representing scars more closely to normal&#xD;
      skin. Both scales showed acceptable internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha 0.76 (patient) and&#xD;
      0.69 (observer). The test-retest reliability of the patient scale has not been evaluated in&#xD;
      burn scars.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Social Experience. It is proposed that partial-thickness burns to both sides of the face&#xD;
      result in non-normal appearance which may cause stigmatizing and dehumanizing behavior&#xD;
      directed at these burn survivors (Lawrence, Fauerbach, Heinberg, Doctor, and Thombs, 2006;&#xD;
      Lawrence, Rosenberg, Rimmer, Tombs, and Fauerbach, 2010). The following two instruments will&#xD;
      assess the social experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The social experience will be measured by two instruments: the Perceived Stigmatization&#xD;
      Questionnaire (PSQ) and the Social Comfort Questionnaire (SCQ) (Lawrence, Fauerbach,&#xD;
      Heinberg, Doctor, and Thombs, 2006; Lawrence, Rosenberg, Rimmer, Tombs, and Fauerbach, 2010).&#xD;
      Both instruments were developed and tested for use with a population of burn injury&#xD;
      survivors. The PQS is a 21 item scale where each item is measured on a 5-point Likert scale&#xD;
      (never, almost never, sometimes, often, always). Three factors were loaded: absence of&#xD;
      friendly behavior, confused behavior and starring, and hostile behavior. Scores are&#xD;
      calculated by totaling items and dividing by 21. Higher scores indicate levels of perceived&#xD;
      stigmatizing behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SCQ is an eight item, one factor scale. Each item is also measured on a 5-point Likert&#xD;
      scale (never, almost never, sometimes, often, always). The final score is the average of&#xD;
      items; higher scores indicate higher social comfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Open-ended Questions: Several open-ended questions will be included to allow participants to&#xD;
      describe instances of how their social experience changed after the facial burn injury. It is&#xD;
      hoped that these answers will further clarify the two instrument findings&#xD;
