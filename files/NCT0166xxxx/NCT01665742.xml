  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The number of overweight and obese children has increased in Ireland at a greater rate than&#xD;
      worldwide trends. The poor eating patterns that drive adolescent obesity leads to an increase&#xD;
      in the number of unhealthy inflammatory hormones and fats circulating in the blood which&#xD;
      increase an adolescent's risk of developing diabetes and heart disease later in life. Dietary&#xD;
      patterns have changed whereby key nutrients that are found in fruit, vegetables and fish,&#xD;
      which are known to have beneficial effects and reduce risk of obesity and diabetes in later&#xD;
      life, may need to be replaced. This project will determine whether a key anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      nutrient supplement taken for 8 weeks will improve the metabolic profile of adolescents aged&#xD;
      13-18 years old. Detailed cellular analysis will determine the cellular and molecular&#xD;
      mechanisms to provide a thorough explanation of the health effects of this intervention.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The emerging model of obesity and diabetes is characterised by sub-acute chronic inflammation&#xD;
      and insulin resistance. Mechanistic data indicates inflamed adipose tissue with increased&#xD;
      infiltration of immune cells that generate pro-inflammatory cytokines. With childhood obesity&#xD;
      in Ireland increasing at a rapid pace, it is important to establish the role of a&#xD;
      non-pharmacological dietary approach to decreasing the sub-acute chronic inflammation seen in&#xD;
      overweight and obese children. Several foods contain nutrients that are known to have&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory properties. Such foods including fish, fruits and vegetables are known to&#xD;
      be deplete in the adolescent diet. The aim of this project is to investigate whether a&#xD;
      nutritional supplement containing anti-inflammatory nutrients, n-3 polyunsaturated fatty&#xD;
      acids (found in fish oil), vitamin C, vitamin E, and polyphenols found in green tea and&#xD;
      tomato; will improve metabolic phenotype in 13-18 year old teenagers over an 8-week period.&#xD;
      Further, to provide insight into the role of genetics in the development of metabolic&#xD;
      dysregulation and response to dietary treatment.&#xD;
