    <textblock>
      This single-center, single-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study with crossover&#xD;
      component will evaluate the GABAAalpha5 receptor expression, occupancy and functional&#xD;
      connectivity in the brains of individuals with Down syndrome and healthy controls following&#xD;
      single dose RG1662. Participants will receive a single dose of placebo before the imaging&#xD;
      session (PET and MRI), and a single dose of RG1662 before the second imaging session.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Healthy controls and individuals with Down syndrome:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male and female adults, 18 to 40 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body mass index (BMI) 18 - 40 kg/m2 inclusive&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females of child-bearing potential and males with female partners of child-bearing&#xD;
             potential must agree to use two medically approved methods of contraception, one of&#xD;
             which must be a barrier method, for the duration of the study and for 4 months after&#xD;
             the last study drug administration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical laboratory values within normal limits or abnormalities considered not&#xD;
             significant by the investigator and sponsor; individuals with thyroid disease may be&#xD;
             included in the study provided they are euthyroid and stable on treatment for at least&#xD;
             one month prior to screening&#xD;
&#xD;
        Individuals with Down syndrome must also meet the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of Down syndrome confirmed by karyotype; subjects may have free trisomy 21&#xD;
             or Robertsonian translocations; mosaic Down syndrome will be excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals must have a parent or other reliable caregiver who agrees to accompany the&#xD;
             inidvidual to all clinic visits, provide information about the individual as required&#xD;
             by protocol, and be willing to give informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Regular smoker (&gt;5 cigarettes or equivalent: 3 cigars, 6 cigarillos, 3 pipes per day)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concomitant disease or condition or any clinically significant finding at screening&#xD;
             that could interfere with, or for which the treatment might interfere with the conduct&#xD;
             of the study, or that would, in the opinion of the investigator, pose an unacceptable&#xD;
             risk to the subject in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe head trauma or CNS infections (e.g. meningitis)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of epilepsy or seizures other than benign febrile convulsions of childhood&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any confirmed significant allergic reactions against any drug, anaphylaxis or severe&#xD;
             environmental allergies as judged by the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive for hepatitis B, hepatitis C or HIV infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive urine test at screening or at follow-up for drugs of abuse, or positive&#xD;
             alcohol breath test at screening and prior to dosing&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous inclusion in research and/or medical protocol involving nuclear medicine, PET&#xD;
             or radiological investigations with significant radiation burden (as defined by&#xD;
             protocol)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or lactating women&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals with evidence or meeting clinical diagnosis of dementia&#xD;
