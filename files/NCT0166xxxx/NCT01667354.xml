      The primary aim of this trial is to test the effectiveness of an intervention to train&#xD;
      primary care physicians to determine if it leads to decreased parental vaccine hesitancy. The&#xD;
      investigators will train primary care teams with an initial training followed by telephone&#xD;
      coaching and follow-up visits, and assess the outcomes of parental vaccine hesitancy&#xD;
      (primary) and physician self-efficacy (secondary) at baseline and 6 months.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Change from Baseline in Parental Hesitancy at 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will contact mothers of newborns in study practices and conduct a telephone survey at two time points: baseline and 6 months. Surveys will assess parental hesitancy, parental trust in provider, and other covariates such as perceived social norms, other sources of information about vaccines, and demographic information.</description>
