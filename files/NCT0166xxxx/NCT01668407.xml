  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effectiveness of non-pharmacological treatment on gait impairment on Parkinson Disease&#xD;
      (PD) such as exercises has been demonstrated; in particular an example for patient tailored&#xD;
      exercises is physiotherapy. The goal of physiotherapy treatment is to enable PD patients to&#xD;
      maintain their maximum level of mobility, activity, and independence. Several systematic&#xD;
      reviews and clinical studies have shown that physical therapy can contribute to minimize the&#xD;
      disabling effects of motor and sensory impairments in order to enhance participation in&#xD;
      societal roles and quality of life. The use of electromechanical devices such as treadmill&#xD;
      training (a supplement to conventional therapies) in the last years has also been used with&#xD;
      PD patients and a systematic Cochrane has been conducted by Mehrholz in 2010 to assess the&#xD;
      effectiveness and acceptability of treadmill training in the treatment of gait disorders for&#xD;
      patients with PD. In the last years new robotic assisted device can be used in gait training&#xD;
      in neurological disorder. Till now only few studies, have focused on the effects of&#xD;
      exoskeleton or end effector robot-assisted training in PD patients, with a interesting&#xD;
      preliminary results.&#xD;

      The specific aims of this project are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to verify whether the robotics lower limb treatment with body weight support is more&#xD;
           effective than the treadmill treatment in the reduction of motor impairment in PD or PSP&#xD;
           patients, and to improve the quality of the gait and the endurance;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to analyze possible improvements in terms of physiological biomechanical gait through&#xD;
           analysis of kinematics , kinetics and EMG evaluation;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to analyze possible improvements in terms of reduction of instable posture and movements&#xD;
           , which can represent a reduction of the risk of fall typical of these subjects;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. to evaluate the kinematic, kinetic and EMG quantitative data during selected movements&#xD;
           (gait, posture, ) compared with age matched reference data;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. to investigate the stability of the effects of robot-assisted treatment at 4/6 months&#xD;
           follow-up in terms of Quality of Life (QoL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A first goal of this project is to investigate the differences in improvement of the quality&#xD;
      and safety of the gait (motor performance and functional recovery) through kinematic/kinetic&#xD;
      and EMG parameters (Change in Step Length, Change in Gait Velocity and Change in Stride Time&#xD;
      Variability, 3D joints kinematics, ground reaction forces, joint kinetics, muscle&#xD;
      activation,) and traditional clinical scales in Parkinson's patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second goals is aimed at identifying possible advantages in the QoL of patients&#xD;
      undergoing such a kind of rehabilitation treatment and at investigating novel methods&#xD;
      enabling lower limb functional recovery, leading to wide potential for regaining personal&#xD;
      independence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third goal is to analyze direct cost savings associated with the use of such&#xD;
      technologies, measured as direct, indirect and intangible costs, through specific HTA&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;
