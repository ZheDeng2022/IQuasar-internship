  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Implantable cardiac defibrillators (ICDs) are devices that are put into patients at high risk&#xD;
      of sudden cardiac death. They are used to treat life threatening heart rhythm disorders. They&#xD;
      have conventionally consisted of a generator sitting under the skin of the chest and leads&#xD;
      which pass from veins in the collar bone region to the heart. Problems with these devices can&#xD;
      necessitate extraction, with the commonest reason being infection. If extraction is required&#xD;
      for infection then re-implantation is usually deferred for approximately one week whilst&#xD;
      antibiotics are given so that the risk of infection of the new device can be minimised. This&#xD;
      has considerable implications for healthcare resources. A new ICD has been developed that is&#xD;
      entirely subcutaneous with no intravenous element. It is already in clinical use and is&#xD;
      positioned remote from conventional ICD sites. With no intravenous element there is very&#xD;
      little risk of infection in the blood affecting the new device. It is therefore likely to be&#xD;
      possible to re-implant these devices immediately after extracting a conventional system. The&#xD;
      aim of this research is to assess the outcome in patients re-implanted with this device&#xD;
      immediately after conventional ICD system extraction. This data will be compared compared to&#xD;
      those who have conventional systems re-implanted after the necessary delay.&#xD;
