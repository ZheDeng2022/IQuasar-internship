      The purpose of this quality improvement research project is to briefly survey attitudes among&#xD;
      healthcare providers toward patients with substance use disorders before and after substance&#xD;
      abuse counselors are placed in the Emergency Room. SBIRT stands for Screening Brief&#xD;
      Intervention and Referral to Treatment. The pre-test survey contains 10 questions about&#xD;
      attitudes toward patients with substance use disorders and the post-test survey consists of&#xD;
      13 questions about attitudes toward patients with substance use disorders and questions&#xD;
      regarding the SBIRT model itself. Health care providers will be surveyed before the SBIRT&#xD;
      Counselors begin and again at 6 months, after full SBIRT program with substance counselors on&#xD;
      site has been in place, as a part of their regular staff education requirements. Part of the&#xD;
      goal of the SBIRT counselors is to educate providers about treatment and analyze data&#xD;
      collected by and comments of Emergency Room staff.&#xD;
