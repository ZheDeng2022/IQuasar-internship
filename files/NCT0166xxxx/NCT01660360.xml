  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability, and maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD) of Tanibirumab in patients with advanced or metastatic cancer who are&#xD;
      refractory or for whom there are no standard therapeutic option.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of Tanibirumab in such patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine a recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of Tanibirumab based on above&#xD;
           assessments&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, first-in-human, open-label, non-randomized, dose-escalating study of&#xD;
      Tanibirumab which is a fully human monoclonal antibody to vascular endothelial growth factor&#xD;
      receptor 2 (VEGFR2/KDR). This study will enroll patients with advanced or metastatic cancer&#xD;
      who are refractory or for whom there are no standard therapeutic options. Tanibirumab will be&#xD;
      administered intravenously to such patients over 60 minutes on Day 1, 8, and 15 (subject to&#xD;
      change pending PK and toxicity data). Each treatment cycle will be a minimum of 28 days in&#xD;
      length. The dose escalation study employing a 3 + 3 design is designed to identify the RP2D&#xD;
      which will be based on safety, tolerability and PK of the RP2D. This study is expected to&#xD;
      enroll a total of approximately 18-24 patients.&#xD;

    <description>The safety and tolerability of Tanibirumab will be assessed using the following measures: frequency and nature of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs); nature, severity, and relatedness of adverse events, graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, v4.0; changes in vital signs; and changes in clinical laboratory parameters.</description>

    <description>The following PK parameters will be derived from the serum concentration-time profile of Tanibirumab following administration: serum total exposure (AUC), Cmax, clearance, volume of distribution (central compartment Vc and at steady state Vss), and half-life (t½).</description>

    <description>The following activity outcome measures will be assessed: objective response, defined as a complete or partial response confirmed 4 weeks after initial documentation; duration of objective response; and progression-free survival. Objective response and disease progression will be determined using RECIST 1.1</description>
