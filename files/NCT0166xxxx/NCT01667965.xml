  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness and acceptability of a recently&#xD;
      created informative video geared for patients who have been evaluated by a radiation&#xD;
      oncologist for palliative radiation therapy during a hospitalization at Memorial&#xD;
      Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. Palliative radiation therapy is radiation therapy that is&#xD;
      given to patients with the purpose of easing symptoms from cancer. It is not given with the&#xD;
      intent to cure the cancer. The video presents basic information about palliative radiation&#xD;
      and palliative care.&#xD;

    <description>Questionnaires will be given before the patient watches a video educational tool to aid informed consent about palliative radiation therapy; and (2) after the patient watches the video educational tool. (3) If the patient receives PRT, a final questionnaire that assesses the patient's impression of the video will also be administered at the conclusion of radiation therapy.</description>
