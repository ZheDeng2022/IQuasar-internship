      Eligible patients will receive subcutaneous vaccinations of the hTERT/survivin/CMV&#xD;
      multipeptide vaccine and GM-CSF over a 24 month period. All patients will receive basiliximab&#xD;
      20 mg 1 day prior to the start of vaccinations. Prevnar vaccine will be administered at the&#xD;
      time of Vaccines 1,3, and 5. Patients who remain clinically stable after the fourth vaccine,&#xD;
      may continue to receive vaccinations every 4 weeks for up to 2 years.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      hTERT is widely found in breast cancer cells and has a role in tumor growth and development,&#xD;
      making it attractive for immunotherapy. Also, recent data suggest that breast cancer is&#xD;
      potentially responsive to immunological therapies. In one trial, patients with advanced&#xD;
      cancer received a series of hTERT vaccinations and 4 of 7 patients with advanced breast or&#xD;
      prostate carcinoma developed hTERT-specific T lymphocytes. Partial tumor regression was&#xD;
      observed in 1 patient. In a second trial, 19 HLA A2+ patients with metastatic breast cancer&#xD;
      were vaccinated with hTERT 1540 peptide in adjuvant with GM-CSF. 68% of patients exhibited&#xD;
      immunological responses with development of CD8+ hTERT-specific T-cells. Overall survival of&#xD;
      vaccine responders was signifiantly better than the overall survival on non-responders. In&#xD;
      order to expand the number of possible immune responses and to potentially bypass immune&#xD;
      tolerance, multiple peptides have been added to the vaccine. In addition, the monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody basiliximab is included to decrease the regulatory T cells which prevent the immune&#xD;
      system to work against the tumor, and GM-CSF and Prevnar are used to boost the immune system.&#xD;
      Subjects will receive a maximum of 28 vaccinations over a 24 months period.&#xD;
