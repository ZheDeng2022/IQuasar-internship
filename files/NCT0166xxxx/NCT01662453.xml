  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to develop a North American registry for SUDEP cases;&#xD;
      requesting family members of epilepsy patients who died suddenly of unclear causes (SUDEP) to&#xD;
      contact the study team. The family members who decide to participate in the study will be&#xD;
      asked to complete a brief telephone interview about their loved one's epilepsy and seizure&#xD;
      history and the circumstances of his or her death. If the death has occurred within the past&#xD;
      24 hours, and the family is willing to consider donating tissue to the study, the subject&#xD;
      will be transferred to the Autism Tissue Program, and the remainder of the phone interview&#xD;
      will be conducted at a later time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the phone interview, the family will be asked to provide access to the&#xD;
      deceased's medical records. Any costs involved in obtaining medical records will be covered&#xD;
      by the study, and all medical information will remain completely confidential.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      SUDEP stands for sudden unexplained death in epilepsy; a witnessed or unwitnessed,&#xD;
      non-traumatic and non-drowning death occurring in benign circumstances, in a person with&#xD;
      epilepsy with or without evidence of a seizure and excluding documented status epileptics&#xD;
      (seizure duration of 130mins or longer, or seizures without recovery in between), in which a&#xD;
      postmortem examination does not reveal a cause of death. SUDEP is not a cause of death so&#xD;
      much as it is a descriptive term for a category of unexplained deaths in people with epilepsy&#xD;
      or epilepsy-related conditions. Little is known about SUDEP and its mechanisms and risk&#xD;
      factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the main objectives of this study is to investigate the role of various risk factors&#xD;
      in the development of sudden unexplained death in patients with epilepsy, with a particular&#xD;
      focus on the role of antiepileptic medications. In addition, we want to elucidate the&#xD;
      pathophysiologic mechanisms leading to SUDEP.&#xD;

      If the family is willing to donate tissue, the family's permission is recorded in writing and&#xD;
      it is filed in the subject's study record. The family can contact Autism Tissue Program (ATP)&#xD;
      themselves or we will transfer the call to the ATP for them. The ATP has a 24/7 on call duty&#xD;
      in place to receive new donors. The ATP coordinator will facilitate the donation process by&#xD;
      coordinating with the family, medical examiner's office or hospital. The coordinator will&#xD;
      also communicate to the research assistant when the donation is complete. In the case the&#xD;
      participant does not want to donate tissue, but would like to donate other DNA samples, they&#xD;
      will be able to do so through the NYU Biorepository. The participant will be consented, by&#xD;
      research personnel, with the specific DNA collection consent form. Mucosal swaps or blood&#xD;
      samples will be collected if available, if neither is available, we will collect hair or&#xD;
      nails.&#xD;

        excluding trauma, drowning, status epilepticus, or other known cause, but there is often&#xD;
