      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) is a condition that can lead to multiple myeloma, a type&#xD;
      of blood cancer. In many high-risk cases, SMM can develop into multiple myeloma in less than&#xD;
      2 years. The current standard of care for SMM is follow-up without treatment until multiple&#xD;
      myeloma develops. However, some drugs are being studied to see if they can slow down or&#xD;
      prevent the disease from progressing. One such drug is MLN9708. It has shown some results&#xD;
      against multiple myeloma. Researchers want to combine MLN9708 with dexamethasone to see how&#xD;
      it works against high-risk SMM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To see if MLN9708 with dexamethasone is a safe and effective treatment for high-risk&#xD;
      smoldering multiple myeloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have high-risk smoldering multiple myeloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine&#xD;
           samples will be collected. Imaging studies and a bone marrow biopsy may also be&#xD;
           performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will take MLN9708 and dexamethasone on a regular schedule for 28 days. They&#xD;
           will take each drug four times at regular intervals during each cycle of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment will be monitored with frequent blood tests and imaging studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have 12 cycles of treatment. After four cycles, patients will be&#xD;
           recommended to have their own stem cells collected and stored. This will allow the&#xD;
           potential application of a highdose melpahalan/autologous stem cell transplant in the&#xD;
           event there is a need in the future (not part of this study).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After 12 cycles, participants will keep taking MLN9708 as long as the disease does not&#xD;
           progress and the side effects are not too severe.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SMM is a precursor condition to MM defined by the clinical parameters of M-protein&#xD;
           greater than or equal to 3.0 g/dL or bone marrow plasma cells greater than or equal to&#xD;
           10% and absence of end organ disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Risk of progression of high risk SMM at 5 years is 72-75% with median time to&#xD;
           progression less than 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The current standard of care for SMM is close follow-up without treatment until&#xD;
           symptomatic MM develops. However, IMWG states Preventive clinical trials need to be&#xD;
           considered for patients with high risk smoldering myeloma .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MLN9708 is a new oral proteasome inhibitor with potent anti-MM effects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -The primary objective of the study is to assess the response rate of MLN9708/low-dose&#xD;
&#xD;
      dexamethasone in patients with high-risk SMM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine progression free survival (PFS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine duration of response (DOR)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate toxicity of combination therapy (MLN9708 and low-dose dexamethasone).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate biological activity of MLN9708 and correlate to clinical outcomes (gene&#xD;
           expression profiling and proteasome activity and ubiquination assays, and effects on&#xD;
           downstream signaling targets using pre- and post-MLN9708 exposure bone marrow samples)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;

        -  SMM according to the International Myeloma Working Group definition i.e.:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Serum M-protein greater than or equal to 3 g/dl and/or bone marrow plasma cells&#xD;
                greater than or equal to 10 %,&#xD;

&#xD;
             -  Absence of renal failure: calculated creatinine clearance (according to MDRD)&#xD;
                greater than 80 ml/min (or alternatively based on standard creatinine level&#xD;
                criteria of 2 mg/dl)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Absence of hypercalcemia: Ca &lt; 10.5 mg/dl or less than or equal to 2.5 mmol/L&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Absence of lytic bone lesion&#xD;

&#xD;
             -  Serum immunoglobulin free light chain &gt;10 mg/dL AND abnormal kappa/lambda ratio&#xD;

&#xD;
             -  total bilirubin less than1.5 X institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) less than 3.0 X institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Single arm pilot trial of combination therapy (MLN9708 and dexamethasone) for high risk&#xD;
      smoldering multiple myeloma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will receive 12 cycles (28 days each) of induction combination therapy of&#xD;
           MLN9708 and low-dose dexamethasone. After 12 cycles of MLN9708/low-dose dexamethasone,&#xD;
           patients will receive MLN9708 maintenance until progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will have routine blood work with SPEP and free light chains monthly&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre- and post-treatment bone marrow biopsies will be obtained for confirmation of&#xD;
           diagnosis and correlative studies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will also undergo evaluation for minimal residual disease at complete&#xD;
           remission/completion of 12 cycles of therapy, using multi-parametric flow cytometry and&#xD;
           FDG PET-CT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This single arm pilot study will enroll 12 evaluable patients and determine M-spike&#xD;
           levels on each patient immediately pre-treatment as well as after completing 12 cycles&#xD;
           of treatment. The study aim is to find 9 or more patients (out of 12) with a partial&#xD;
           response (PR) or better; which would provide strong evidence that the true probability&#xD;
           of an overall response is consistent with 80% or more.&#xD;
