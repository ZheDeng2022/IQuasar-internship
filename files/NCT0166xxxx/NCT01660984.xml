      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) is a rare cancer of the thyroid gland. In children and&#xD;
      adults, it is often part of a condition called Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia 2 (MEN2). MEN2 is&#xD;
      usually caused by a genetic mutation, and it can cause a number of problems in addition to&#xD;
      MTC. These problems include adrenal gland tumors, hormone changes, and problems with the&#xD;
      bones and other organs. Not much is known about how MTC develops over time, especially in&#xD;
      people with MEN2. Researchers want to study MTC in children and adults and see how it affects&#xD;
      their growth and development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study how medullary thyroid cancer affects children and adults over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Children and adults who have medullary thyroid cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a brief physical exam and medical history. Blood and&#xD;
           tissue samples will be collected to see whether participants have the MEN2 genetic&#xD;
           mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment will not be provided as part of this study. However, participants will be&#xD;
           receiving standard care for MTC. They may be eligible for other clinical trials at the&#xD;
           National Institutes of Health.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have regular study visits every 6 to 12 months to evaluate their MTC&#xD;
           and any treatment. Blood tests, imaging studies, and other tests may be performed as&#xD;
           needed to monitor the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants and their parents/guardians will also complete questionnaires about their&#xD;
           health and emotions during the study.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma (MTC) is a calcitonin producing tumor arising from the&#xD;
           parafollicular C cells of thyroid. In children and adults, MTC is usually seen in&#xD;
           association with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia (MEN) 2A and 2B, which are rare cancer&#xD;
           syndromes resulting from germline mutations of Rearranged during Transfection (RET)&#xD;
           proto-oncogene. MTC develops in virtually all patients with MEN 2, and is the leading&#xD;
           cause of death in these patients. Patients with MEN 2 may have other characteristic&#xD;
           manifestations such as pheochromocytoma and hyperparathyroidism in MEN 2A and&#xD;
           pheochromocytoma, ganglioneuromatosis, and skeletal deformities in MEN 2B.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete surgical resection is the only current curative treatment for MTC, and the&#xD;
           tumor is unresponsive to standard chemotherapy and conventional doses of radiation&#xD;
           therapy. However, more than half the patients present with advanced or metastatic&#xD;
           disease and cannot be cured surgically. Novel agents are currently under investigation&#xD;
           for treatment of MTC, and vandetanib, an oral RET and receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)&#xD;
           inhibitor was recently approved by the FDA for adults with advanced or metastatic MTC.&#xD;
           Vandetanib also has activity in children with hereditary MTC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  However, complete responses to RTKs have not been observed, and some patients develop&#xD;
           resistance to the treatment with RET and RTK inhibitors or have primary refractory&#xD;
           disease. The natural history of MTC, particularly in patients with MEN 2, the molecular&#xD;
           pathways involved in tumorigenesis, and the development of resistance to targeted&#xD;
           therapies are not well understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -The overall objective of this longitudinal study is to develop a better understanding of the&#xD;
      biology and natural history of MEN2 with or without MTC, particularly in children and adults&#xD;
      with MEN 2A and 2B, as well as study non-tumor manifestations of MEN 2. This will hopefully&#xD;
      allow for developing more effective treatment interventions for tumor and non-tumor related&#xD;
      manifestations, and more sensitive endpoints in clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients, must have histologically or cytologically confirmed MTC, confirmed by the&#xD;
           Laboratory of Pathology, NCI or who have MEN2 (regardless of MTC status).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Parent or primary caregiver of patient participant (&lt;= 21)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may be undergoing standard care or receiving treatment on a clinical trial&#xD;
           while participating in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will allow for longitudinal evaluations of MTC and MEN2 and non-tumor related&#xD;
      manifestations of MEN 2A and 2B in children and adults. Evaluations will consist of the&#xD;
      following (summarized):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Clinical and radiological evaluations&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Detailed pathologic and molecular analysis of tumor specimens will be performed,&#xD;
           including immunohistochemistry (IHC), comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), and&#xD;
           genome sequencing. CGH and genome sequencing will be performd with co-enrollment on&#xD;
           protocol 10-C-0086 Comprehensive Omics Analysis of Pediatric Solid Tumors and&#xD;
           Establishment of a Repository for Related Biological Studies.&#xD;
