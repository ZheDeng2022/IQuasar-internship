      Increased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) is a serous issues in children with functional&#xD;
      single ventricle during the staged operative period. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      investigate if Bosentan therapy can improve the survival and life quality after staged Fontan&#xD;
      procedure in the children with high risk of increased PVR.&#xD;
