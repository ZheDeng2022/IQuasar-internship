      This clinical trial studies how well donor stem cell boost works in treating patients with&#xD;
      low blood cells after donor stem cell transplant. Donor stem cell boost may increase low&#xD;
      blood cell counts caused by hematologic cancer or its treatment.&#xD;

      Successful engraftment after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is defined&#xD;
      by an actual neutrophil count (ANC) of &gt; 500 10^6/L and a self-sustaining platelet count of&#xD;
      20 x 10^9/L. ANC recovery usually occurs 14 to 21 days after the infusion of donor HSCs with&#xD;
      red cell and platelet recovery typically following within the same time frame, although&#xD;
      resolution of anemia may occur last. Recovery time is dose dependent, but in one report,&#xD;
      donor HSC aliquots containing 1.9 to 20.5 10^6/kg CD34+ cells resulted in an ANC of &gt; 500&#xD;
      10^6/L at a median of 12 days and 16 days for patients receiving filgrastim versus those not&#xD;
      receiving a white cell growth factor. In this trial, self-sustaining platelet counts of 20 x&#xD;
      10^9/L occurred at median times of 15 to 11 days respectively. The results of another trial&#xD;
      comparing outcomes between patients receiving mobilized peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs)&#xD;
      versus those receiving marrow from their donors showed that median times ANC of &gt; 500 10^6/L&#xD;
      and self-sustaining platelet counts of 20 x 10^9/L were 16 and 13 days respectively in the&#xD;
      group receiving PBSCs and 21 and 19 days in those receiving marrow. Similar HSC doses&#xD;
      associated with successful engraftment in these time frames have been demonstrated in other&#xD;
      trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most transplant centers require a minimum dose of 1 to 2 x 10^6 CD34+ cells/kg to achieve&#xD;
      adequate count recovery in a reasonable time frame post HSCT, although an early trial&#xD;
      examining recovery after autologous reinfusion of HSCs demonstrated that a threshold of 2.5 x&#xD;
      10^6/kg of CD 34 cells was associated with consistent and rapid WBC and platelet recovery&#xD;
      times (18 and 14 days respectively). A later trial assessing autologous PBSC mobilization in&#xD;
      breast cancer patients showed that HSC doses of ≥ 5 x 10^6 CD34+ cells/kg were associated&#xD;
      with an 85% probability of WBC and platelet recovery by day 14, but with doses of 2 x 10^6 or&#xD;
      less, 10% of patients had platelet recovery beyond day +28. While the precise dose of HSCs&#xD;
      for successful engraftment in the allogeneic setting is not known, patient characteristics&#xD;
      such as myelofibrosis and/or splenomegaly are likely to cause interpatient variation in the&#xD;
      minimum number of HSCs needed for successful engraftment. In addition, donor factors such as&#xD;
      mismatch in size with the recipient and biologic variation in the number of HSCs that can be&#xD;
      obtained from any individual donor, can create a deficit in the amount of HSCs required for&#xD;
      robust count recovery in a particular recipient. All of these factors can contribute to a&#xD;
      poor functional or numeric cell dose and result in pancytopenia after HSCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drugs required for the prophylaxis and treatment of GVHD and infection have myelotoxic&#xD;
      effects post HSCT, and unlike their use in solid organ transplantation, the marrow toxic&#xD;
      effects of these drugs are potentially more severe and longer lasting in the presence of a&#xD;
      newly reconstituting immune system. While many drugs can have negative effects on marrow&#xD;
      function after HSCT, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and ganciclovir are two of the most commonly&#xD;
      used agents with the potential to cause cytopenias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After hydrolysis to its active form, mycophenolic acid (MPA), MMF inhibits T and B cell&#xD;
      proliferation making its use valuable in the prevention of graft versus host and host versus&#xD;
      graft reactions post HSCT, especially in conjunction with a calcineurin inhibitor. Levels of&#xD;
      MPA are increased in the presence of altered renal function, and other commonly used post&#xD;
      HSCT drugs including acyclovir, ganciclovir, valaganciclovir, and tacrolimus. A major side&#xD;
      effect of MMF is pancytopenia, particularly neutropenia, which is exacerbated by high drug&#xD;
      levels. Due to finding of a wide interpatient variability in drug exposure, it has recently&#xD;
      been recommended that the monitoring of MPA levels would result in better therapeutic&#xD;
      outcomes, although MPA drug levels are not commonly obtained as yet in clinical practice.&#xD;
      Myelotoxicity from the drug is observed after renal transplantation in the presence of a&#xD;
      non-transplanted immune system demonstrating the potent myelosuppression associated with this&#xD;
      drug, and the increased toxicity in patients with abnormal renal function. Patients post HSCT&#xD;
      are treated with multiple drugs that both increase MPA levels and alter creatinine clearance,&#xD;
      and are thereby highly susceptible to the marrow toxic effects of the drug which can result&#xD;
      in cytopenias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ganciclovir and valganciclovir, which is rapidly converted to ganciclovir by intestinal&#xD;
      mucosal cells and hepatocytes to ganciclovir, are inhibitors of DNA synthesis. Ganciclovir is&#xD;
      a known myelotoxic drug that is effective in prophylaxis and treatment of cytomegalovirus&#xD;
      (CMV) infections in transplant recipients. Salzberger et al. examined the outcomes between&#xD;
      engraftment and day +100 post HSCT of 278 patients receiving ganciclovir and found that 41%&#xD;
      of patients receiving the drug had an ANC less than 1000 10^6/L for at least 2 consecutive&#xD;
      days. Hyperbilirubinemia during the first 20 days after HSCT, elevated serum creatinine after&#xD;
      day +21, and low marrow cellularity between days +21 and +28 were significant risk factors&#xD;
      for neutropenia. Patients with 3 risk factors had a 57% chance of developing neutropenia,&#xD;
      which was significantly associated with a decreased overall and event free survival. As noted&#xD;
      above, concomitant use of ganciclovir and MMF increase the serum concentration of both drugs&#xD;
      exacerbating marrow toxicity. Because CMV is a life-threatening disease post HSCT, it is&#xD;
      often necessary to use ganciclovir especially in the presence of renal failure which is&#xD;
      exacerbated with the use of foscarnet, the alternate drug for CMV treatment. Therefore,&#xD;
      ganciclovir-induced pancytopenia may be unavoidable in certain contexts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other medications with potentially toxic effects on the marrow alone or in combination with&#xD;
      other commonly used agents which may contribute to the development of post HSCT cytopenias&#xD;
      include levetiracetam, methotrexate, antibiotics such as linezolid, vancomycin, amoxicillin,&#xD;
      cephalosporins, cidofovir, and gabapentin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to insufficient allogeneic cell doses and medication toxicities, infections post&#xD;
      HSCT can also result in persistent cytopenias. Reactivation of human herpes virus 6 (HHV-6)&#xD;
      and CMV in particular are associated with pancytopenia. HHV-6 reactivates at a median of 20&#xD;
      days post-HSCT and active infection has been shown in almost 50% of patients. The clinical&#xD;
      syndrome associated with an active HHV-6 infection varies in intensity and may include&#xD;
      encephalitis, rash, interstitial pneumonitis, and secondary graft failure. A transient,&#xD;
      clinically insignificant HHV-6 reactivation occurs in many patients and because the symptoms&#xD;
      of an HHV-6 infection are heterogenous and therefore less recognized, the disease may become&#xD;
      severe prior to the recognition that the reactivation requires treatment. HHV-6 can become&#xD;
      chronically active and has been associated not only with secondary graft failure, but pure&#xD;
      red cell aplasia as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CMV reactivation in the post HSCT period can also be accompanied by an acute syndrome&#xD;
      manifested by fever, myalgia, and suppressed marrow function. Leukopenia at the start of CMV&#xD;
      therapy has been associated with a poor response to anti-viral therapy and is a risk factor&#xD;
      for progression of CMV viremia to CMV disease. While the most serious manifestations of CMV&#xD;
      disease are related to pulmonary and enteral infections CMV-induced marrow suppression and&#xD;
      marrow failure has been described, with identification of specific genotypes of CMV highly&#xD;
      associated with mortality from pancytopenia. Because CMV and the treatment for CMV can both&#xD;
      be associated with post HSCT cytopenias, it is often difficult to distinguish which of the&#xD;
      two is the major etiological factor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the pathophysiology is unclear, persistent cytopenias post HSCT have also been&#xD;
      associated with acute and chronic GVHD, bacterial and fungal infections, and impaired hepatic&#xD;
      and renal function. Because failure of hematopoietic recovery after HSCT is associated with&#xD;
      compromised patient survival, this protocol was developed to provide patients with persistent&#xD;
      cytopenias post HSCT a boost of their original donors' HSCs to improve peripheral blood&#xD;
      counts.&#xD;
