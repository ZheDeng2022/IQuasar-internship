  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The general objectives of this study are to verify the feasibility of a short home-based&#xD;
      rehabilitation program for cancer patients prior to lung resection surgery, and to quantify&#xD;
      its effects on aerobic capacity, exercise tolerance and skeletal muscle strength.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the hypotheses of this study are that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Implementation of a short home-based rehabilitation program (4 weeks) based on exercise&#xD;
           training is feasible and safe in patients with lung cancer resection candidates.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Compared to control patients, patients included in the home-based rehabilitation program&#xD;
           will improve significantly their aerobic capacity, exercise tolerance and arms and legs&#xD;
           muscle force.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Being the leading cause of death from cancer, lung cancer represents a pressing health issue&#xD;
      which generates significant social costs. In Canada, in 2009, an estimated 23 400 people will&#xD;
      be diagnosed with lung cancer, and 20 500 will die from the disease. For people with&#xD;
      localized non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), lung resection surgery offers the best chance&#xD;
      of curing the disease. In addition with lung cancer, these patients often experience such&#xD;
      effects as a reduction in their exercise capacity and tolerance, muscle weakness, and&#xD;
      decreased quality of life. Many researches demonstrated a link between a low exercise&#xD;
      capacity and cardiopulmonary complications surrounding surgery. Therefore, the implementation&#xD;
      of a preoperative pulmonary rehabilitation program, focused on improving aerobic capacity,&#xD;
      could have significant positive outcomes, notably by reducing operative risks. The&#xD;
      effectiveness of pulmonary rehabilitation, whether carried-out in a supervised setting or as&#xD;
      a home-based program, is well recognized and such programs are included in guidelines for&#xD;
      many pulmonary diseases. Despite these facts, few researches have studied its impact on lung&#xD;
      cancer patients waiting for surgery. Moreover, not one have examined the feasibility and&#xD;
      effectiveness of a home-based program for this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to use that time waiting for surgery to increase exercise capacity and work tolerance&#xD;
      of cancer patients waiting for surgery. Our expertise in pulmonary rehabilitation will prove&#xD;
      to be invaluable to carry out this research project which objectives are to verify the&#xD;
      feasibility of a short home-based rehabilitation program for cancer patients waiting for lung&#xD;
      resection surgery, and to measure its effects on aerobic capacity, work tolerance and muscle&#xD;
      strength.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this way, we hope to contribute in developing innovative interventions that will assist&#xD;
      the Canadian Lung Association's mission of improving the health of patients with respiratory&#xD;
      problems. The results of this study will lead toward the development of a multicenter,&#xD;
      randomized study that will be designed to verify the impact of such interventions on&#xD;
      postoperative complications in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study will take place at the research center of the Institut de cardiologie et de&#xD;
      pneumologie de Québec (IUCPQ), in collaboration with the thoracic surgery division and the&#xD;
      Pavillon de Prevention des Maladies Cardiaques (PPMC). Once the lung cancer and surgical&#xD;
      procedure considered by pneumologist, we will obtain the patient's consent and we will&#xD;
      proceed to the initial assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the initial evaluation participants will undergo a 4-week home-based rehabilitation&#xD;
      program under the supervision of an exercise specialist certified by the American College of&#xD;
      Sport Medicine. Patients will be reevaluated after 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary screening: An initial screening, including maximal oxygen consumption assessment,&#xD;
      will be performed under the supervision of a respiratory physician (Dr F. Maltais) to ensure&#xD;
      that patients meet the all the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the study. In addition, a&#xD;
      brief history of each patient's disease course and medication will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometric measurements: Weight and height will be measured to determine the Body Mass&#xD;
      Index (BMI). Body composition will be analyzed by bio-impedance (InBody 520, Biospace).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life and psychological distress: Generic quality-of-life questionnaires provide&#xD;
      information on many aspects of a patient's life and can also be used to discriminate between&#xD;
      patients within the same population. However, they are not as responsive to change as&#xD;
      disease-specific questionnaires. Thus, generic quality-of-life assessment will be obtained at&#xD;
      the time of enrolment. The SF-36 survey was selected for its ease of administration and&#xD;
      because it is the most largely used questionnaire. A French version of the SF-36 is currently&#xD;
      available. These data will be obtained only for descriptive analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmonary function tests: Standard pulmonary function tests including spirometry, lung&#xD;
      volumes, and carbon monoxide diffusion capacity will be obtained for all subjects during the&#xD;
      initial evaluation, according to previously described guidelines, and related to appropriate&#xD;
      reference values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Incremental cycle exercise test: In order to determine peak aerobic capacity and eligibility,&#xD;
      and to quantify changes in exercise tolerance occurring with exercise training, an&#xD;
      incremental exercise test will be performed (before inclusion). Patients will be seated on an&#xD;
      electrically braked ergocycle (Quinton Corival 400; A-H Robins, Seattle, WA) and connected to&#xD;
      the exercise circuit through a mouthpiece (Sensor Medics, Vpeak Legacy, Yorba Linda, CA). A&#xD;
      progressive stepwise exercise test will be performed up to individual's peakimum capacity,&#xD;
      using exercise steps of 1 minute and increments of 5-10 watts. Heart rate and oxygen&#xD;
      saturation will be recorded using pulse oximetry and ECG, respectively. Symptoms of dyspnea&#xD;
      and leg fatigue will be recorded using a modified Borg scale for perceived exertion52.&#xD;
      Testing will take place under medical supervision, in the exercise physiology laboratory of&#xD;
      IUCPQ research center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Constant workrate cycle exercise test and 6-min walking test: A constant workrate cycle&#xD;
      exercise test and a 6-min walking test will be performed to quantify changes in exercise&#xD;
      tolerance occurring with exercise training.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. During the constant workrate cycle exercise test, patients will be asked to pedal at 80%&#xD;
           max exercise work rate determined during the maximal test, and the time to exhaustion&#xD;
           will be measured. Heart rate, dyspnea Borg score, and oxygen saturation will be&#xD;
           monitored. Supplemental oxygen will be used if oxygen saturation &lt; 90%.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. For the 6-min walking test, patients will also be asked to walk as far as possible for 6&#xD;
           minutes with standardized encouragement53. Two trials will be done and only the best one&#xD;
           will be used for data analysis. Monitoring of respiratory and cardiac parameters, in&#xD;
           addition to dyspnea and leg fatigue (modified Borg scale) will be done during the test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strength evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Quadriceps strength will be assessed in two ways. First, by maximum voluntary&#xD;
           contraction, and second, by measuring supramaximal twitch tension from a series of&#xD;
           twitch following a magnetic stimulation (Magstim 200; Magstim Co.) of the femoral nerve&#xD;
           as previously described. Generated force will be measured by an isometric force gauge&#xD;
           while subjects will be in a standardized positioning. Validity and sensitivity of this&#xD;
           equipment have previously been studied and we have used it in previous studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Maximum voluntary contraction of the biceps brachii, deltoid and hamstring will be&#xD;
           measured with a hand-held dynamometer (Microfet. Hoggan Inc, USA), using the method&#xD;
           described and validated by Andrews and colleagues56. Finally, a maximum prehension&#xD;
           strength will be assessed with a hydraulic dynamometer (Jamar).&#xD;

    <description>The rehabilitation program will be a self-monitored and minimally supervised home-exercise program. Exercise training modalities and intensity will be adapted to patient's individual condition. It will include aerobic and strength exercises 5 times a week for 4 weeks. Aerobic training will be done on a portable ergocycle. The target intensity will correspond to 60% of the maximal work rate achieved during the maximal progressive cardio-pulmonary exercise test, aiming for a cumulative time of 40 minutes per day. The heart rate, corresponding to an exercise level of 60% of max exercise capacity during the maximum exercise test, will be noted and patients will be instructed to train at this heart rate ± 10 beats. Muscle exercises will be performed using elastic bands and use of gravity.</description>
