    <textblock>
      A total of 86 patients underwent total hysterectomy. Three of them refused randomization, 34&#xD;
      were randomly assigned to undergo to laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) and 34 to&#xD;
      undergo micro-laparoscopy (M-LPS).Laparoscopic hysterectomy can be safely performed by M-LPS&#xD;
      and LESS.&#xD;

      Between May 2011 and February 2012 a prospective randomized study was carried out at the&#xD;
      Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Division of Gynecologic Oncology, Catholic&#xD;
      University of the Sacred Heart, Rome-Italy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consenting patients scheduled to be submitted to a total laparoscopic hysterectomy for&#xD;
      benign, pre-malignant and malignant disease were evaluated for this study. Inclusion criteria&#xD;
      for total laparoscopic hysterectomy were: appropriate medical status for laparoscopic&#xD;
      surgery; uterine size &lt; 12 weeks of pregnancy; no previous longitudinal major abdominal&#xD;
      surgery. Patients who had a pelvic organ prolapse greater than grade I, were excluded from&#xD;
      this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-operative work-up included gynecologic examination, trans-vaginal ultrasound. In case of&#xD;
      early endometrial and cervical cancer a staging MRI or CT was performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our institutional review board approved the study (Protocol number P/473/CE/2011), and all&#xD;
      women gave their informed consent to use their data. All patients were adequately informed&#xD;
      concerning the possible risks and benefits of the described technique and signed a written&#xD;
      consent agreeing to undergo the procedure and to eventual conversion to LPS or laparotomy, if&#xD;
      necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were randomly assigned to either a hysterectomy with LESS or with M-LPS. The surgeon&#xD;
      was notified of the allocation in theater on the morning of the procedure. The same surgical&#xD;
      team performed both techniques. Assignment to one of the two surgical approaches was on 1:1,&#xD;
      using a block randomized computer-generated list.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The operative time (OT) was defined as the interval between start incisions to closure. The&#xD;
      intra-operative complications was defined as bowel, bladder, ureteral, or vascular injuries,&#xD;
      and the estimated blood loss (EBL) ≥ 500 ml. Anemia was considered when hemoglobin level was&#xD;
      ≤ 8 g/dl and fever when body temperature was at least 38C° in two consecutive measurements at&#xD;
      least 6 hours apart, excluding the first day after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative pain assessment (in the immediate post-operative period) was performed in all&#xD;
      patients using a validated Visual Analog Pain Scale (VAS) and scored from 0 to 10 (0 = no&#xD;
      pain and 10 = agonizing pain). Post-operative pain was subjectively reported considering the&#xD;
      patient at rest at 20 minutes and 2-4-8 hours after surgery. All patients were managed with&#xD;
      the same intra-operative anesthetic protocol and post-operative analgesic drug (Paracetamol&#xD;
      1,000 mg) was administered only on patient's demand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LPS conversion was defined as single or multiple 5 mm port insertion. The perioperative&#xD;
      complications were defined as those occurring within the first month following the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical Technique The operative technique is the same in the two groups with the exception&#xD;
      of videoloparoscope, port type and some specific instruments. Once achieved pneumoperitoneum&#xD;
      (12 mmHg), a careful inspection of the entire abdominal cavity was performed as first&#xD;
      surgical step. All surgical procedures were performed with an intrauterine manipulator. After&#xD;
      coagulation and section of round ligament to enter into the retroperitoneal space, the ureter&#xD;
      was visualized and a haemostatic clip was positioned at the origin of the uterine artery. In&#xD;
      order to safely cauterize and dissect the ovarian vessels, a window was opened between the&#xD;
      left ovarian pedicle above and the ureter below. The vesico-uterine and vesico-vaginal&#xD;
      peritoneum was dissected starting from the lateral to the medial. These surgical steps allow&#xD;
      an excellent skeletonization of the uterine vessels, medially to the ureter along the uterus,&#xD;
      which can be easily cauterizated and sectioned. The vagina was incised circumferentially&#xD;
      following the porcelain-valve of the uterine manipulator as a guide. The uterus and the&#xD;
      adnexa were extracted through the vagina. The vaginal vault was closed with a running suture.&#xD;
      A hydro-pneumatic test for bladder integrity at the end of surgery was always performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LESS hysterectomy was performed through a multi-channel single trocar (TriPort, Olympus&#xD;
      Winter &amp; Ibe GmbH, Hamburg - Germany) inserted in the umbilicus using an open technique&#xD;
      (1.5-2 cm cutaneous incision), as previously reported (7). Intra-abdominal visualization was&#xD;
      obtained with a 0° 5-mm telescope with a flexible tip (EndoEYE, Olympus Winter &amp; Ibe GmbH,&#xD;
      Hamburg - Germany). Working straight 5-mm instruments were inserted into the remaining 2&#xD;
      ports, choosing among graspers, cold scissors, suction/irrigation bipolar coagulator and a&#xD;
      multifunctional versatile laparoscopic device, which grasps, coagulates and transects&#xD;
      simultaneously (PKS cutting forceps, 43 cm, Gyrus ACMI, Hamburg, Germany). In order to&#xD;
      prevent clashing between instruments and surgeon's hands and to facilitate surgical&#xD;
      manoeuvres, the combination of one 33 cm-long instrument with a 43 cm-long instrument was&#xD;
      adopted. The umbilical fascia was closed with a figure-of-eight 0-Vicryl.&#xD;
&#xD;
      M-LPS hysterectomy was performed through one optical trans-umbilical 5 mm trocar (Endopath&#xD;
      Xcel 5mm optiview, Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Cincinnati, OH) and three 3 mm sovra-pubic ancillary&#xD;
      ports (Karl Storz Endoskope - 3 mm trocar set, Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany). A 5 mm 0°&#xD;
      endoscope (EndoEYE, Olympus Winter &amp; Ibe GmbH, Hamburg - Germany) and 3 mm laparoscopic&#xD;
      instruments (Karl Storz Endoskope - 3 mm Instrument Set, Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany)&#xD;
      were utilized, choosing among graspers, cold scissors, suction/irrigation and bipolar&#xD;
      coagulator (PK 3mm, Gyrus ACMI, Hamburg - Germany). The present study is the first randomised&#xD;
      one that directly compared M-LPS and LESS for total hysterectomy. We can argue that comparing&#xD;
      two minimally invasive surgeries, variations are minimal and only a careful analysis can&#xD;
      identify them. In our trial, we showed that there were no significant differences between the&#xD;
      two techniques in terms of peri-operative outcomes except for OT that was longer in LESS with&#xD;
      respect to M-LPS.As far as early post-operative pain is concerned, we found that patients&#xD;
      undergoing M-LPS experienced significantly less pain with respect to those managed by LESS.&#xD;
