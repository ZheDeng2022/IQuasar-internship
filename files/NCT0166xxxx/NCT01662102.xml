  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of consolidation treatment Zevalin®&#xD;
      versus maintenance treatment with Rituxan® on progression-free survival (PFS) following&#xD;
      response induction with chemotherapy plus rituximab in previously untreated participants with&#xD;
      follicular lymphoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter and randomized study. Participants registered after&#xD;
      response induction (PR/CR) to R-chemotherapy. Participants achieving either a partial&#xD;
      response (PR) or complete response (CR) following R-chemotherapy eligible for randomization&#xD;
      to either consolidation with 90Y-ibritumumab tiuxetan followed by observation for 24 months,&#xD;
      or rituximab maintenance for 24 months. After the observation/maintenance period, patients&#xD;
      follow up for 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was terminated early for business reasons. (Maximum duration of study was up to&#xD;
      approximately 2.7 months).&#xD;

    <description>The FACT-G is a participant rated, 27-item compilation of general questions divided into 4 primary Quality of Life (QOL) sub-scales: physical well-being (PWB; 7-items, score range 0-28), social/family well-being (SWB; 7-items, score range 0-28), emotional well-being (EWB; 6-items, score range 0-24), and functional well-being (FWB; 7-items, score range 0-28). This tool represents the generic core questionnaire that are utilized in combination with cancer site-specific questionnaires, (FBrain, in this study) Overall score and four subscale scores with ranges and distributions that are sample-specific can be calculated.FACT-G is scored by summing the individual scale scores; higher scores indicate better quality of life. FACT-G uses 5-point rating scale ranging from (0) = Not at all; (1) = A little bit; (2) = Somewhat; (3) = Quite a bit; to (4) = Very much.The FACT-G total score is the sum of the four subscale scores (if least 80% completed) and has a possible range of 0-108 points.</description>

    <description>EORTC-QLQ-C30 is a cancer-specific instrument with 30 questions for evaluation of new chemotherapy and provides an assessment of participant reported outcome dimensions. First 28 questions used 4-point scale (1=not at all,2=a little,3=quite a bit,4=very much) for evaluating 5 functional scales (physical,role,emotional,cognitive,social), 3 symptom scales (fatigue,nausea/vomiting,pain) &amp; other single items. For each item,high score represented high level of symptomatology/problem. Last 2 questions represented participant's assessment of overall health &amp; quality of life, coded on 7-point scale (1=very poor to 7=excellent).EORTC QLQ-C30 observed values and change from baseline for global health status (scoring of questions 29 &amp; 30) and 5 functional scales, 3 symptom scales and other single items (scoring of questions 1 to 28). Answers were converted into grading scale, with values between 0 and 100. High score represented a favourable outcome with a best quality of life for participant.</description>

Participants who respond to treatment and Participants who are lost to follow-up censored at the visit on which the dosing of a new medication was evaluated.</description>

        <description>EORTC-QLQ-C30 is a cancer-specific instrument with 30 questions for evaluation of new chemotherapy and provides an assessment of participant reported outcome dimensions. First 28 questions used 4-point scale (1=not at all,2=a little,3=quite a bit,4=very much) for evaluating 5 functional scales (physical,role,emotional,cognitive,social), 3 symptom scales (fatigue,nausea/vomiting,pain) &amp; other single items. For each item,high score represented high level of symptomatology/problem. Last 2 questions represented participant's assessment of overall health &amp; quality of life, coded on 7-point scale (1=very poor to 7=excellent).EORTC QLQ-C30 observed values and change from baseline for global health status (scoring of questions 29 &amp; 30) and 5 functional scales, 3 symptom scales and other single items (scoring of questions 1 to 28). Answers were converted into grading scale, with values between 0 and 100. High score represented a favourable outcome with a best quality of life for participant.</description>

          <title>European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30)</title>
          <description>EORTC-QLQ-C30 is a cancer-specific instrument with 30 questions for evaluation of new chemotherapy and provides an assessment of participant reported outcome dimensions. First 28 questions used 4-point scale (1=not at all,2=a little,3=quite a bit,4=very much) for evaluating 5 functional scales (physical,role,emotional,cognitive,social), 3 symptom scales (fatigue,nausea/vomiting,pain) &amp; other single items. For each item,high score represented high level of symptomatology/problem. Last 2 questions represented participant's assessment of overall health &amp; quality of life, coded on 7-point scale (1=very poor to 7=excellent).EORTC QLQ-C30 observed values and change from baseline for global health status (scoring of questions 29 &amp; 30) and 5 functional scales, 3 symptom scales and other single items (scoring of questions 1 to 28). Answers were converted into grading scale, with values between 0 and 100. High score represented a favourable outcome with a best quality of life for participant.</description>
