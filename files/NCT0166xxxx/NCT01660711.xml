      The purpose of the study is to demonstrate that it is possible to administer chemotherapy&#xD;
      prior to and following surgery for pancreatic cancer which is considered operable. The&#xD;
      chemotherapy chosen is that which has been shown to be the most effective in treating&#xD;
      metastatic disease, and the goal is both to investigate whether this is tolerable and also to&#xD;
      investigate the efficacy of this approach in terms of disease response and survival.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is a highly lethal disease. It is estimated that in 2010&#xD;
      there were approximately 43,140 new cases in the United States and 36,800 deaths which ranks&#xD;
      fourth among cancer related deaths . At diagnosis, roughly 17,000 of the initial 43,000&#xD;
      patients have disease which appears to be localized to the pancreatic bed, but unfortunately,&#xD;
      only a minority of these patients (15-20%) are immediately operable (on imaging studies their&#xD;
      disease appears to be both localized to the pancreas and technically resectable with clear&#xD;
      margins, and at surgery no unexpected findings preclude an R0 resection ). It should be noted&#xD;
      that of those patients deemed immediately operable on clinical grounds, between 20 and 57%&#xD;
      are found to have inoperable disease on exploration depending on the series and on the extent&#xD;
      and nature of preoperative staging. The majority of patients have locally advanced,&#xD;
      borderline resectable or unresectable disease owing to involvement of critical structures,&#xD;
      most particularly sentinel blood vessels such as the SMA, celiac axis, hepatic artery, SMV,&#xD;
      or portal vein. Furthermore, despite recent advances in systemic therapy, even those&#xD;
      fortunate few able to undergo immediate surgery remain largely incurable, with a five year&#xD;
      survival of slightly less than 20%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current standard of care for adjuvant therapy in resectable pancreatic cancer is based on&#xD;
      the CONKO-001 study which randomized patients to 6 cycles of postoperative adjuvant therapy&#xD;
      with gemcitabine versus observation alone. Results favored adjuvant gemcitabine in both&#xD;
      disease free survival (13.4 vs 6.9 months, p&lt;0.001) and overall survival (24.2 months vs 20.5&#xD;
      months p=0.02) strongly supporting the use of adjuvant gemcitabine in the setting of both R0&#xD;
      and R1 resections. An RTOG study - 97-04 - concluded that gemcitabine was probably superior&#xD;
      to 5FU when used pre and postoperatively in combination with 5FU/RT, with a HR of 0.82. The&#xD;
      role of radiation therapy in this setting remains controversial, with studies such as the&#xD;
      GITSG trial (pro) and ESPAC 1 (con) criticized either for questionable design, outdated&#xD;
      chemotherapy or unconventional radiation therapy. Current studies in progress examining&#xD;
      postoperative therapy include RTOG 0848 (phase III looking at adjuvant gemcitabine versus&#xD;
      gemcitabine plus erlotinib plus/minus chemo/RT using fluorouracil), ACOSOG Z5041 evaluating&#xD;
      gemcitabine plus erlotinib in the pre and postoperative setting and ESPAC 4 evaluating&#xD;
      gemcitabine versus gemcitabine plus capecitabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many studies have explored the use of neoadjuvant therapy in initially resectable, borderline&#xD;
      resectable and unresectable disease. The majority of these have been single arm, single&#xD;
      institution phase I/II studies, and results have been mixed. Potential benefits of a&#xD;
      neoadjuvant approach include: downstaging of disease with an increased percentage of margin&#xD;
      negative and lymph node negative resections; no delay in systemic therapy aimed at&#xD;
      eradicating micrometastatic disease; the detection of biologically aggressive tumors, as&#xD;
      evidenced by early progression/metastases during this phase of therapy, thereby avoiding&#xD;
      inappropriate surgery; and the greater likelihood of completing all intended therapy as&#xD;
      opposed to postoperative treatment, where fully 22 - 35% of patients do not complete their&#xD;
      intended program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A comprehensive meta-analysis and systematic review of neoadjuvant therapy in both resectable&#xD;
      and unresectable pancreatic cancer has recently been published. The conclusion reached in&#xD;
      resectable patients was that resection frequency and survival following neoadjuvant therapy&#xD;
      was similar to that in patients undergoing primary resection followed by adjuvant therapy. In&#xD;
      patients with initially unresectable disease, fully one third had resectable tumors following&#xD;
      neoadjuvant therapy with survival comparable to initially resectable patients. In aggregate,&#xD;
      these observations indicate that a neoadjuvant approach is feasible and effective, and that&#xD;
      this sequence does not compromise resectability or survival, even in those patients with the&#xD;
      best prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With respect to specific studies in resectable disease, investigators at MD Anderson Cancer&#xD;
      Center have published their most recent results. In their first study, 86 patients with&#xD;
      resectable disease in the head of the pancreas received radiation therapy (30 Gy in 10&#xD;
      fractions over 2 weeks) plus 7 weekly infusions of gemcitabine at 400 mg/m2/week. 85% of&#xD;
      these patients were taken to surgery and 74% were able to undergo the intended&#xD;
      pancreaticoduodenectomy. Median survival for patients whose disease was resected was 34&#xD;
      months, but it was only 7 months for those whose disease could not be resected. In a second&#xD;
      study of patients with resectable adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head, 90 patients were&#xD;
      enrolled with the goal of administering chemotherapy alone for eight weeks, using gemcitabine&#xD;
      and cisplatin, followed by combined low dose gemcitabine and radiation therapy (30 Gy in 10&#xD;
      fractions). Ultimately, 79 (88%) patients completed the full course of preoperative therapy&#xD;
      and 62 of these (78%) patients were taken to surgery. 52 (66%) had their disease resected&#xD;
      with a median survival of 31 months for those who had surgery, versus 10.5 months for those&#xD;
      who did not. They concluded that initial combination chemotherapy with gemcitabine and&#xD;
      cisplatin followed by chemotherapy/RT did not improve on the results achieved with&#xD;
      chemotherapy/RT alone. This result is perhaps not surprising as gemcitabine, both alone and&#xD;
      in doublet combinations, has simply not been active enough to materially impact on the&#xD;
      outcome of this disease. Interestingly, the longer preoperative interval did not result in&#xD;
      local tumor progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These findings are similar to those of other major centers reporting studies of neoadjuvant&#xD;
      gemcitabine based chemoradiation for potentially resectable disease, and suggest that this is&#xD;
      a valid strategy for further study in this setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, investigators in Europe reported their results with a novel combination of&#xD;
      docetaxel 30 mg/m2 weekly and RT of 45 Gy in 34 patients with resectable disease. 32% had&#xD;
      progression, 59% stable disease and 9% partial remission. 50% of the original cohort had&#xD;
      pancreaticoduodenectomy with 100% R0 resection and a median survival of 32 months. The&#xD;
      numbers are small and the overall resection rate disappointingly low, but the R0 resection&#xD;
      rate and median survival for those resected is equivalent to patients receiving gemcitabine&#xD;
      based regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In locally advanced, unresectable disease, results have recently been reported from Austria&#xD;
      with neoadjuvant gemcitabine/oxaliplatin without RT (39% of patients undergoing resection of&#xD;
      disease with 69% R0 and 22 months median survival), Italy with neoadjuvant PEFG/PEXG&#xD;
      (cisplatin, epirubicin, 5-fluorouracil (F)/capecitabine (X), gemcitabine) or PDXG (docetaxel&#xD;
      substituting for epirubicin) followed by RT plus X, F or G (14% resected with median survival&#xD;
      16.2 months)and Japan with neoadjuvant gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2/wk and RT 50 Gy in T3 disease&#xD;
      followed by postoperative 5FU liver perfusion (82% of patients with disease resected, 43% 5&#xD;
      year survival). In each of these studies, there is a mixture of borderline resectable and&#xD;
      unresectable disease with the result that the interpretation of outcomes is problematic.&#xD;
      However, it is clear that a neoadjuvant approach is feasible and active.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is clear from an examination of the NCI CTEP database that the neoadjuvant approach has&#xD;
      been widely embraced for future study. More than 40 active protocols are listed, including&#xD;
      the following select few: a UVA study of hypofractionated RT plus chronomodulated&#xD;
      capecitabine in resectable and borderline resectable disease; a UT Southwestern phase I study&#xD;
      of SBRT or SBRT plus gemcitabine; an Emory phase I study of FOLFIRINOX and SBRT; a Fred&#xD;
      Hutchinson study of GTX and oxaliplatin with IMRT and adjuvant gemcitabine; a UF phase II&#xD;
      study of risk adapted gemcitabine plus abraxane; a European randomized phase II study of&#xD;
      gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin pre and gemcitabine postoperatively versus gemcitabine&#xD;
      postoperatively only; a Memorial Sloan Kettering phase II study of gemcitabine plus&#xD;
      oxaliplatin preoperatively plus gemcitabine postoperatively; and an ACOSOG study of&#xD;
      gemcitabine plus erlotinib pre and postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Looking to the future there have been a number of recent innovations in chemotherapy. In an&#xD;
      ongoing effort to discover non-gemcitabine based chemotherapy for those who have progressed&#xD;
      on gemcitabine, and also a new regimen with more efficacy than those currently used in&#xD;
      patients with pancreatic cancer, the combination of 5FU, leucovorin, oxaliplatin and&#xD;
      irinotecan has been tested. This combination was initially studied in colorectal cancer, in a&#xD;
      regimen known as FOLFOXIRI. It was established that this combination was both tolerable and&#xD;
      effective in this setting. Subsequently, the regimen was modified slightly to the current&#xD;
      FOLFIRINOX format (oxaliplatin 85mg/m2, irinotecan 180 mg/m2, leucovorin 400 mg/m2 , 5FU 400&#xD;
      mg/m2 on day 1, then 5FU 2400 mg/m2 as a 46 hour continuous infusion) and tested in a phase&#xD;
      II study in pancreatic cancer. 47 chemotherapy-naïve patients with metastatic disease were&#xD;
      enrolled and 46 were treated. Confirmed response rate was 26% with 4% complete responses.&#xD;
      Median time to progression was 8.2 months and median overall survival was 10.2 months. Grade&#xD;
      3/4 toxicities included neutropenia (52%), nausea (20%), vomiting (17%), diarrhea (15%), and&#xD;
      neuropathy (15%). No toxic death occurred. FOLFIRINOX was then tested after failure of&#xD;
      previous gemcitabine therapy in metastatic disease and was deemed to be promising. 13&#xD;
      patients were treated, with 9 evaluable for response - 6 had stable disease with a mean time&#xD;
      to progression of 6.6 months, and 3 progressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a consequence of the previously mentioned phase II study in chemo-naïve patients, a&#xD;
      randomized phase II/phase III study comparing gemcitabine (G) to FOLFIRINOX (F) as first line&#xD;
      treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer was conducted. This study was terminated&#xD;
      prematurely by the study IDMC as it was determined that additional patient accrual would not&#xD;
      add to the statistical power of the study. 342 patients were accrued with roughly one third&#xD;
      of the primary disease involving the head of the pancreas. Overall objective response rate&#xD;
      was 32% for F versus 9.4% for G. PFS was 6.4 months versus 3.4 months and overall survival&#xD;
      11.1 months versus 6.8 months, all in favor of F.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall survival rate of 11.1 months is the best result achieved thus far in a randomized&#xD;
      phase III study of chemotherapy in metastatic pancreatic cancer. Notable toxicities of at&#xD;
      least grade III/IV, which were all worse with F, were neutropenia (45.7 vs 18.7%), febrile&#xD;
      neutropenia (5.4 vs 0.6%), fatigue (23.7 vs 14.2%), vomiting (14.5 vs 4.7%) and diarrhea&#xD;
      (12.7 vs 1.2%). These results indicate that this is a notably active regimen with an&#xD;
      encouraging response rate. However, the potential toxicities are significant, and it is a&#xD;
      regimen that should be offered only to patients with ECOG 0-1 performance status and&#xD;
      excellent supportive care. In this regard, in an attempt to ameliorate these toxicities,&#xD;
      modifications to the published regimen have already been proposed by the French group and&#xD;
      others. In their forthcoming study of FOLFIRINOX in the adjuvant setting, the French will&#xD;
      omit the bolus of 5FU which contributes significantly to the myelosuppression but which is&#xD;
      thought to have minimal impact on the therapeutic efficacy. In addition, most physicians now&#xD;
      incorporate the routine use of neulasta with each treatment cycle. This study will similarly&#xD;
      incorporate these modifications and the regimen will be named mFOLFIRINOX.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, in the context of perioperative therapy, we have identified a regimen - FOLFIRINOX -&#xD;
      with the best results to date in the treatment of metastatic disease and by inference,&#xD;
      promise of improved outcome in those patients with resectable disease. If successful, this&#xD;
      has the potential to improve DFS and overall survival (until now no better than 15-20% at 5&#xD;
      years) in these patients, and may establish a new paradigm for future studies.&#xD;

             infants secondary to treatment of the mother with FOLFIRINOX, breastfeeding should be&#xD;
             discontinued if the mother is treated with these agents. These potential risks may&#xD;
             also apply to other agents used in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of&#xD;
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with mFOLFIRINOX. In addition, these&#xD;
             patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with&#xD;
             marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients&#xD;
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently active second malignancy other than non-melanoma skin cancer or carcinoma&#xD;
             in-situ of the cervix. Patients are not considered to have a &quot;currently active&quot;&#xD;
             malignancy if they have completed therapy and have no evidence of recurrence for at&#xD;
             least 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pre-existing neuropathy greater than grade 1.&#xD;
