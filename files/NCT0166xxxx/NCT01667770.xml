  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is to find out which types of dural grafts used during surgery for Chiari&#xD;
      Malformations are superior. We believe that autologous dural grafts are superior to&#xD;
      non-autologous grafts.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study compares autologous grafts vs. non-autologous grafts. Non-autologous grafts include&#xD;
      synthetics and grafts from animals. Autologous grafts have a better side-effect profile than&#xD;
      non-autologous grafts. We believe this improved side-effect profile will result in a&#xD;
      decreased incidence of reoperation for post-operative infections and post-operative fluid&#xD;
      collections (pseudomeningoceles and seromas). Study is open to all non-pregnant minor and&#xD;
      adult subjects. Subjects must have symptomatic Chiari Malformation described as &gt; or equal to&#xD;
      6mm descent of the cerebellar tonsils below the foramen magnum with accompanying headaches&#xD;
      and/or neurologic findings (arm pain/weakness, myelopathy, etc.). After the 12-month&#xD;
      follow-up is completed on the first 100 subjects there will be an interim analysis of the&#xD;
      results in order to determine whether one of the treatments has a statistically superior&#xD;
      outcome. If a statistically superior outcome is noted, the trial will stop after being&#xD;
      reviewed by a data monitoring committee. If no statistically significant difference is seen&#xD;
      at one year, the study will continue until the 12-month follow-up is completed on the 200th&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
