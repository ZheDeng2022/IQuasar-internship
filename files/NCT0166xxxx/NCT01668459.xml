      A study for patients with confirmed locally advanced or metastatic Transitional Cell&#xD;
      Carcinoma of the bladder or upper urinary tracts who have developed progressive disease&#xD;
      within 12 months of their platinum based chemotherapy. The study aims to compare the overall&#xD;
      response rate of cabazitaxel treatment versus best supportive care including single agent&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bladder cancer was the 9th most common cause of cancer worldwide in 2002. About 70% of&#xD;
      patients have superficial tumour and 30% have invasive tumour at diagnosis. Patients with&#xD;
      superficial tumour are treated by surgery, which is the only curative treatment. However,&#xD;
      about 50% of these patients will relapse, and cannot be cured by local treatment in the&#xD;
      majority of cases. The survival of untreated metastatic patients does not exceed 3 to 6&#xD;
      months, and systemic chemotherapy increases overall survival of patients with unresectable&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the overall survival of patients with advanced disease treated with chemotherapy&#xD;
      remains short (14 months), which reflects a substantial unmet medical need for more effective&#xD;
      therapy in this very poor prognosis disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cabazitaxel is a new taxane, taxanes have demonstrated activity in advanced bladder cancer,&#xD;
      and are among the most active new cytotoxic agents to be assessed in transitional cell&#xD;
      carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cabazitaxel has demonstrated activity in cell lines with acquired resistance to doxorubicin,&#xD;
      vincristine, vinblastine, paclitaxel, and docetaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomised, open-label, parallel-group phase 2 study of cabazitaxel versus best&#xD;
      supportive care (including chemotherapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is divided into three phases: screening, treatment, and follow-up. The treatment&#xD;
      phase comprises a maximum of six three-weekly cycles of therapy, with a post treatment&#xD;
      discontinuation visit taking place 3 weeks after last dose of treatment before the follow-up&#xD;
      phase begins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This phase 2 study will initially recruit 25 patients and after interim analysis will to&#xD;
      increase to recruit 96 patients randomised between the two treatment options and the study is&#xD;
      expected to last about 2 years.&#xD;
