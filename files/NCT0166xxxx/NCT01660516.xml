      Tea consumption may impact upon the decrease in endothelial function after IR-injury.&#xD;
      However, no previous study directly examined the potential of tea to impact upon the change&#xD;
      in endothelial function after IR-injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that tea consumption counteracts endothelial damage in response&#xD;
      to ischaemia reperfusion injury in healthy humans.&#xD;

      Rationale: Occlusion of an artery (causing ischemia) is a frequently reported condition, e.g.&#xD;
      myocardial infarction, cerebral infarction or during organ transplantations. The period of&#xD;
      ischemia will be followed by reperfusion (possibly after an operation). The ischaemic period&#xD;
      as well as the reperfusion are both associated with damage to the tissue, including the&#xD;
      endothelium. It is hypothesised that production of oxidative stress and reduced NO&#xD;
      bioactivity (through increased reactive oxygen production) during ischaemia and reperfusion&#xD;
      is involved in the development of tissue damage to the endothelium. Interventions that can&#xD;
      prevent or attenuate endothelial dysfunction in response to ischemia-reperfusion (IR)-injury&#xD;
      have a potential clinical relevance to prevent (complications of) cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have examined the effect of tea consumption on the endothelial function.&#xD;
      These studies demonstrated a dose-dependent improvement of tea to improve endothelial&#xD;
      function in healthy and diseased humans, possibly through the vasoactive effects of&#xD;
      flavonoids, which may involve increased nitric oxide bioactivity and inhibition of NADPH&#xD;
      oxidase. Based on the ability of flavonoids to decrease (the impact of) oxidative stress, tea&#xD;
      consumption may also impact upon the decrease in endothelial function after IR-injury.&#xD;
      However, no previous study directly examined the potential of tea to impact upon the change&#xD;
      in endothelial function after IR-injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To examine whether tea consumption counteracts endothelial damage in response to&#xD;
      ischaemia reperfusion injury in healthy humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters: Change in endothelial function (measured with flow mediated dilation)&#xD;
      after ischaemia reperfusion injury (induced by 20 minutes ischemia and 20 min reperfusion)&#xD;
      with and without precedence of tea consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: Non-invasive cuff occlusion is used to examine endothelial function (5-minute&#xD;
      ischaemia) and produce the stimulus that induces ischaemia-reperfusion injury (20-minute&#xD;
      ischaemia). This repeated cuff inflation is non-invasive and not associated with a health&#xD;
      risk for the subject. Tea consumption is safe and, most likely, daily routine for most&#xD;
      participants. The only difference is that this study will monitor and instruct participants&#xD;
      regarding their tea consumption in the week preceding the tests. The volunteers will not&#xD;
      benefit directly from participating in this study.&#xD;

        Twenty-one volunteers, aged between 30 and 70 years, were included in our study. All&#xD;
        subjects were healthy and free of (a history of) cardiovascular disease or obesity (BMI &gt;30&#xD;
        kg/m2). Individuals were excluded if they reported a chronic or acute disease, including&#xD;
        any kind of metabolic abnormality (such as diabetes mellitus) or cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
        Habitual smokers (n=3) were instructed to withdraw from smoking on the day of testing. To&#xD;
        further avoid confounding factors, the investigators also excluded individuals reporting&#xD;
        daily intense sporting activities (&gt;10 h/w), and/or were treated with a diet due to any&#xD;
        reason.&#xD;
