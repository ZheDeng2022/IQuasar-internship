    <textblock>
      Anesthetizing nerves in the extremities is an effective way to freeze an area in preparation&#xD;
      for surgery. The doctor injects local anesthetic in an appropriate area, interrupting signals&#xD;
      from nerves in that area that control movement and sensation. Depending on how much&#xD;
      anesthetic is injected, the doctor can impair both movement and sensation or sensation alone.&#xD;
      Currently, there are a few methods used to determine how much sensation a patient has in an&#xD;
      area, such as testing the patient's response to a pinprick or cold sensation on the skin.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, these methods are subjective and don't always give an accurate measurement of&#xD;
      how extensive the block is. For this reason, a more accurate and objective method of&#xD;
      assessing nerve blocks is needed. We wish to perform a study to test two nerve stimulation&#xD;
      devices to compare their ability to give adequate measurements of nerve activity before and&#xD;
      after local anesthesia. If we find that a common nerve stimulator can consistently give&#xD;
      accurate readings of nerve activity, anesthesiologists may be able to use this device to&#xD;
      determine how well a nerve block is working and adjust the patient's anesthesia accordingly.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background and rationale Peripheral nerve blocks (PNBs) are highly effective methods of&#xD;
      anesthetizing regions of the body for surgery. Throughout its history, the field of regional&#xD;
      anesthesiology has lacked an objective, quantitative tool for assessing the effectiveness of&#xD;
      a given block. Current methods for assessing blocks are mainly subjective and rely on patient&#xD;
      feedback to determine how well a nerve is blocked; these methods include 1) sensory tests,&#xD;
      such as ability to detect a pinprick or cold sensation, 2) motor tests, for example, ability&#xD;
      to flex or extend the body part that has been blocked, and 3) verbal feedback by the patient.&#xD;
      Although these methods usually provide a satisfactory assessment of the block, an objective&#xD;
      tool that could decisively and consistently determine how well a nerve is blocked would avoid&#xD;
      the ambiguity inherent to the subjective tests and may allow anesthesiologists to more&#xD;
      precisely control pain during and after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nerve stimulation technology represents one possible method for objectively assessing PNBs by&#xD;
      eliciting paresthesia in the region of the body undergoing blockade. Nerve stimulation&#xD;
      devices operate by sending an electrical current to a nerve, depolarizing it, and eliciting&#xD;
      muscle contraction or paresthesia, depending on the type of nerve stimulated (motor or&#xD;
      sensory, respectively). In theory, patients may exhibit a higher current perception threshold&#xD;
      in regions of the body that have been anesthetized. Several nerve stimulation devices are&#xD;
      commercially available, although they vary in cost, setup, and features. The Neurometer&#xD;
      diagnostic stimulator is a percutaneous nerve stimulation device that records sensory nerve&#xD;
      conduction thresholds and is commonly used to diagnose neuropathies associated with&#xD;
      conditions such as carpal tunnel syndrome, diabetes, and spinal cord lesions. The Neurometer&#xD;
      generates constant alternating current sinusoid waveform stimuli at three different&#xD;
      calibrated frequencies: 2000 Hz, 250 Hz, and 5 Hz with a range of stimulus output intensities&#xD;
      from 0.01 to 9.99 milliAmperes (mA). The current is delivered to the skin surface via a pair&#xD;
      of 1 cm diameter gold electrodes separated by 1.7 cm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other devices, such as peripheral nerve stimulators, are commonly connected to insulated&#xD;
      needles or stimulating catheters to locate nerves to be blocked. When connected to a surface&#xD;
      electrode probe, a peripheral nerve stimulator delivers an electric current that elicits&#xD;
      motor or sensory activity as the current stimulates the appropriate target nerve. The device&#xD;
      generates square pulses with selectable stimulus duration and continuously adjustable&#xD;
      stimulation current. The pulse current can be adjusted to appropriate levels, allowing&#xD;
      extremely precise adjustments of the stimulation current. The stimulation frequency and&#xD;
      stimulus duration can be varied for different applications. The nerve stimulator features the&#xD;
      option of selecting a frequency of 1 Hz or 2 Hz for sequential electrical nerve stimulation&#xD;
      and stimulus duration of 0.05 milliseconds (ms) to 1 ms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the Neurometer represents the gold standard in percutaneous nerve stimulation, it is&#xD;
      expensive, making it impractical for use in everyday clinical applications. We hypothesize&#xD;
      that a common peripheral nerve stimulator device can be used as a functional substitute for&#xD;
      the Neurometer in generating a sensory stimulus to assess PNB effectiveness. The aim of this&#xD;
      study is to compare the Neurometer and a common nerve stimulator to assess anesthesia&#xD;
      following PNB. We predict that the nerve stimulator can be used successfully as a substitute&#xD;
      for the Neurometer in assessing PNBs in patients receiving regional anesthesia of the&#xD;
      extremities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study objective To compare the Neurometer and a common peripheral nerve stimulator in&#xD;
      measuring current perception threshold in patients receiving PNB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis A nerve stimulator can be used in place of the Neurometer to generate a sensory&#xD;
      stimulus to reliably and accurately assess the extent of PNB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures This study will recruit patients scheduled for elective surgery at the&#xD;
      University of Alberta Hospital (UAH). Since this is an observational study, a sample size of&#xD;
      60 participants will be chosen for convenience. Each week at the UAH, numerous outpatient&#xD;
      surgeries are performed on the abdomen and upper and lower extremities, allowing the data to&#xD;
      be collected over a span of several months. Potential participants will be recruited by a&#xD;
      member of the study team either on the Same-Day Admitting Ward or in the holding area&#xD;
      adjacent to the nerve block area and operating theatres. Signed consent will be obtained from&#xD;
      each participant; participation will be voluntary and patients have the right to withdraw&#xD;
      from the study at any point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the nerve block, a member of the study team will record nerve responses in various&#xD;
      areas on the patient's extremities (hands, feet) or appropriate sensory area using both the&#xD;
      Neurometer and a nerve stimulator (Stimuplex HNS 12, B.Braun, Germany). Common nerve blocks&#xD;
      for surgeries of the upper extremities include interscalene, supraclavicular,&#xD;
      infraclavicular, while lower extremity surgeries commonly entail spinal or ankle blocks or&#xD;
      popliteal blocks of the sciatic nerve. Epidural blocks are commonly used for abdominal&#xD;
      surgeries. The Neurometer current perception threshold (CPT) test is administered at&#xD;
      standardized cutaneous test sites that are specific for dermatomal and peripheral nerve&#xD;
      evaluations. The standardized CPT exam includes preparing each test site with supplied prep&#xD;
      paste and testing the subject at each body site with all three frequencies in the following&#xD;
      order: 2000 Hz, 250 Hz and 5 Hz. A pair of gold electrodes is coated with a thin layer of&#xD;
      conductive gel and then taped to the cutaneous site being tested. Next, an intensity&#xD;
      alignment procedure is conducted to approximate the sensory threshold within a 10 mA range.&#xD;
      Then, using an automated double-blind (micro-processor controlled) methodology, the subject&#xD;
      is presented with 7-10 cycles of randomly selected real and false stimuli, above and below&#xD;
      their perception threshold level, until the exact CPT value within that range is determined.&#xD;
      This testing methodology is able to determine reproducible CPT measures within a +/-10 mA&#xD;
      range. The nerve stimulator test will involve connecting a ground electrode and surface&#xD;
      electrode probe (Pajunk, Germany) to the nerve stimulator. The ground electrode will be&#xD;
      secured on the body and the current will be delivered by touching the tip of the probe to the&#xD;
      same points on the body as tested with the Neurometer. A small amount of conducting gel will&#xD;
      be applied to the area to be tested before applying the tip of the probe to the skin. A&#xD;
      stimulation frequency of 2 Hz will be used and current will be gradually increased from 0.0&#xD;
      mA until the patient can detect a 'tingling' feeling in the area. The study team will also&#xD;
      assess the block using a cold sensation test, in which a cold stimulus (a rubber glove&#xD;
      containing ice) is applied to the skin and the patient is asked to give feedback on their&#xD;
      perception of the cold stimulus (see below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After pre-block data has been recorded, patients will receive an ultrasound-guided PNB&#xD;
      appropriate to the type of surgery to be performed in standard fashion. After the block has&#xD;
      been performed, patients' nerve response in the blocked region will be assessed with the two&#xD;
      nerve stimulation devices and the standard cold stimulus test at appropriate intervals (e.g.,&#xD;
      10, 20, 30 minutes) until it the patient is ready for surgery. For the electrical stimulus&#xD;
      tests, the current required to elicit sensation in the block region at different stimulation&#xD;
      frequencies (2 Hz for the nerve stimulator and 2000 Hz, 250 Hz, and 5 Hz for the Neurometer)&#xD;
      will be recorded. For the cold stimulus test, a scale measuring sensation will be used (3 =&#xD;
      full sensation; 2 = reduced sensation but still cold; 1 = sensation, but not cold; 0 = no&#xD;
      sensation). The block will be deemed complete when the current readout on the electrical&#xD;
      devices reaches 10 mA and when the cold sensation is 1 or less; at this point, the patient&#xD;
      will be transferred to the surgical suite.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following surgery, patients' nerve response in the blocked region will be assessed with the&#xD;
      two devices and the cold stimulus test in the post-anesthesia recovery room. Data will be&#xD;
      recorded by hand on data collection sheets and will be transferred to a MS Excel database&#xD;
      following the study. Nerve response data obtained with the Neurometer and nerve stimulator&#xD;
      will be compared to determine if the nerve stimulator is able to reproduce to a satisfactory&#xD;
      extent the nerve stimulation readings of the Neurometer. These results will also be compared&#xD;
      to the results of the cold stimulus test to detect any correlation between a patient's nerve&#xD;
      response data and when they were able to detect the cold stimulus.&#xD;
