      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the benefit of treatment of refractory Eustachian&#xD;
      tube dysfunction with standard treatment for endolymphatic hydrops. Eustachian tube&#xD;
      dysfunction is a common diagnosis made in otolaryngology related to abnormal pressure&#xD;
      equalization of the middle ear space related to a swollen, inflamed, or occluded Eustachian&#xD;
      tube. The symptoms of this include perceived hearing loss, a feeling of fullness in the&#xD;
      affected ear/ears, ear pain, ear popping, and occasionally imbalance. These symptoms overlap&#xD;
      with a more rare and difficult to diagnose condition known as endolymphatic hydrops, or an&#xD;
      overproduction to fluid in the inner ear. The treatment for these two conditions are distinct&#xD;
      and traditionally, patients are treated for Eustachian tube dysfunction first as it is much&#xD;
      more common and there are several treatments, namely nasal steroids, antihistamines, and&#xD;
      pressure equalization tubes. For patients who do not improve with these treatments, they are&#xD;
      often treated with diuretics and a low salt diet to treat for supposed endolymphatic hydrops.&#xD;
      There has never been a study to investigate the utility of these treatments in patients with&#xD;
      refractory Eustachian tube dysfunction. There is also reason to believe that chronic ETD with&#xD;
      effusion can lead to both inner and middle ear dysfunction. Thus, this study aims to&#xD;
      determine the benefit of standard endolymphatic hydrops treatment on patient with refractory&#xD;
      Eustachian tube dysfunction symptoms in a prospective fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with refractory Eustachian tube dysfunction (patients with no or minimal symptom&#xD;
      improvement despite nasal steroid and antihistamine treatment followed by myringotomy tube&#xD;
      placement) have an element of endolymphatic hydrops and these patient's symptoms will improve&#xD;
      with a low sodium diet and diuretic.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eustachian tube dysfunction is one of the most common problems encountered in general&#xD;
      otolaryngology clinical practice. Symptoms of ear pressure, decreased hearing, ear pain, ear&#xD;
      popping, and frequent ear infections are often blamed on the inability of the Eustachian tube&#xD;
      to equalize air pressure across the ear drum. If the Eustachian tube is occluded, the middle&#xD;
      ear space becomes a closed chamber in which normal gas exchange cannot occur. Treatment of&#xD;
      Eustachian dysfunction has traditionally focused on a two tier system. First, patients are&#xD;
      most often placed on a nasal steroid and an antihistamine. This medication regimen leads to&#xD;
      decreased nasal inflammation, mucosal swelling, and treats nasal allergy. In many patients,&#xD;
      this treatment improves symptoms completely or reduces them to a tolerable level. If the&#xD;
      patient's symptoms are not improved, the next step in management is to create a surgical&#xD;
      tract to the middle ear via a myringotomy (a hole across the ear drum) and placing a pressure&#xD;
      equalization tube across the tympanic membrane. This bypasses any anatomical obstruction in&#xD;
      the Eustachian tube and allows the middle ear pressure to equalize with the atmospheric&#xD;
      pressure across the tympanic membrane. Unfortunately, despite this, there are patients with&#xD;
      refractory symptoms, often ear pressure and subjectively decreased hearing. These symptoms&#xD;
      are also frequently associated with inner ear disease, specifically endolymphatic hydrops.&#xD;
      Endolymphatic hydrops is felt to be related to over production of endolymphatic fluid, the&#xD;
      fluid within the inner ear. Thus, we propose that patient's will refractory Eustachian tube&#xD;
      dysfunction are experiencing an inner ear phenomenon, and that they would benefit from&#xD;
      treatment similar to how endolymphatic hydrops (or over production of endolymphatic fluid) is&#xD;
      managed. The mainstays of management of endolymphatic hydrops are a low sodium diet and&#xD;
      diuretic treatment (hydrochlorothiazide/triamterene). Both of these treatments aim to reduce&#xD;
      endolymph production.&#xD;
