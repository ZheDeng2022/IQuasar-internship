  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) are epithelial carcinomas with a high&#xD;
      frequency of EGF-R expression. EGFR is an important regulator of tumour progression and&#xD;
      proliferation in several types of cancer. Mechanism of action of Lapatinib in the EGFR and/or&#xD;
      HER2 expressing oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cells is attributed to inhibition&#xD;
      of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis. Based on the data from oesophageal SCCs the&#xD;
      investigators hypothesise that EGFR signalling pathway and its interactions play an important&#xD;
      role in the SCC pathogenesis and represent a good therapeutic target from these tumours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the tumour response macroscopically in patients with primary cutaneous SCC&#xD;
      lesions and in concomitant SCC in situ (AK).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate tolerability of a single dose regimen of systemic lapatinib therapy in&#xD;
           patients with SCC as measured by time to first AE or SAE within the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the molecular tumour response of squamous cell carcinoma lesions in&#xD;
           patients under lapatinib treatment using a set of variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Trial with medicinal product&#xD;
