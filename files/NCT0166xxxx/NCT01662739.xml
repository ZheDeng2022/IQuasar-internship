      Gastric cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. There is&#xD;
      difference between different countries in the world in the incidence and outcome. Also Italy&#xD;
      on its inside shows a variability between regions and Lombardy hold the most incidence and&#xD;
      mortality Italian rate, with the province of Cremona as one of the leading area with its&#xD;
      gastric cancer mortality rate. (http://www.aslcremona.it/html/atlante/introduzione.htm).&#xD;
      Tumor specialized registry can be viewed as one of the main strategies for studying and&#xD;
      monitoring the impact of an important cancer diagnosis. In addition the information obtained&#xD;
      from it can be translated into preventive measures and health surveillance that might lead to&#xD;
      a better control of this tumor in a province with a so high mortality rate. Project purpose&#xD;
      is to define the incidence of gastric cancer in the province of Cremona and the correlation&#xD;
      with environmental, familiar, genetic and social factors; to adopt prevention strategies to&#xD;
      reduce the impact of the disease and to create a gastric cancer bio-bank, including blood and&#xD;
      tissue samples, for collaborative research projects regarding molecular and cellular aspects&#xD;
      of gastric cancer.&#xD;

      Background: Gastric cancer (GC) is the 5th most common cancer and the 3rd leading cause of&#xD;
      cancer-related deaths worldwide. GC incidence and mortality rates vary widely across&#xD;
      different geographical areas. In Italy the province of Cremona is characterized by an high&#xD;
      incidence, compared with the national one. For these reason a specialized population based&#xD;
      registry was set up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Up to now the collection encompasses all the GC cases diagnosed in Cremona province&#xD;
      from January 1st 2010 until December 31st 2015. The main data sources were represented by the&#xD;
      pathological records and the patient clinical charts. Data were collected following AIRTum&#xD;
      (Associazione Italiana Registri Tumori) and IARC (International Agency for Research on&#xD;
      Cancer) cancer registration recommendations. Territory of Cremona province comprises 3 main&#xD;
      public hospitals and 3 private structures. All of them refer to 2 pathology services. All&#xD;
      these facilities were involved in the project. A minority of patients usually ask for&#xD;
      different surgery and move to neighboring provinces, mainly Milan and Brescia. An official&#xD;
      collaboration with these facilities was signed in order to have the access to the data of&#xD;
      their patients who were inhabitants of the province of Cremona. A multidisciplinary team of&#xD;
      clinicians (oncologists, gastroenterologists, general practitioners, surgeons), pathologists,&#xD;
      geneticists and methodologists (epidemiologists, hygienists) was involved in the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The registration of an incident case usually began with the pathological confirmation of&#xD;
      diagnosis of cancer. Subsequently, medical records were obtained. For each case the following&#xD;
      variables were registered: personal and familiar data; imaging studies performed; details on&#xD;
      surgery and other treatments received; host genetic background and biomolecular&#xD;
      characteristic, social and environmental factors. All data were collected, recorded,&#xD;
      protected and processed in accordance to AIRTum-IARC (International Agency for Research on&#xD;
      Cancer) cancer registration recommendations and national privacy laws.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any age at diagnosis was included. At the time of diagnosis patients had to be inhabitants of&#xD;
      the province of Cremona (districts of Crema, Cremona or Casalmaggiore). Only diagnoses of&#xD;
      primary gastric neoplasms were considered. Precancerous lesions and relapsed tumor diagnoses&#xD;
      were not considered. For the specific purposes of our study, we didn't record cases diagnosed&#xD;
      based on Death Certificate Only (DCO)&quot;in situ&quot; tumors were also included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Site of the tumor at diagnosis was stomach or gastro-esophageal junction (GEJ), ref. cod.&#xD;
      ICD-X C16, according to the UICC, 7th ed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All gastric malignancies were considered: gastric cancer; lymphoma; sarcoma and GIST. Gastric&#xD;
      cancer was classified according to the Lauren's classification system, which distinguishes&#xD;
      two main histological types: &quot;intestinal&quot; and &quot;diffuse&quot; . &quot;Mixed&quot; gastric carcinomas composed&#xD;
      of intestinal and diffuse components have also been identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary tumor location was divided into three groups in consideration not only of the&#xD;
      oncological but also of the surgical approach. Such groups were 1) GEJ-cardia; 2)&#xD;
      body-fundus; 3) antrum-pylorus-angulus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TNM classification was recorded and the corresponding pathological stage was determined&#xD;
      according to the 7th edition of the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) and&#xD;
      hereditary cases according to International GC Linkage Consortium guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of the infection of Helicobacter pylori (HP) was performed by immunohistochemistry&#xD;
      (IHC) in health gastric mucosa using the GIEMSA stain method. The HER-2 oncogene&#xD;
      overexpression was evaluated in tumour gastric mucosa by the IHC method Dako Hercept TestTM.&#xD;
      Results were confirmed by Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization (FISH) when IHC positivity score&#xD;
      was 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To individuate Hereditary Diffuse Gastric Cancer (HDGC) cases, criteria by International GC&#xD;
      Linkage Consortium 2010 guidelines were followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Incidence, standard errors, and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated according to&#xD;
      the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) general guidelines. As for CIs, the&#xD;
      method that considered the approximation to the Poisson distribution was chosen. Age-specific&#xD;
      incidence rates were stratified into 18 subgroups by 5-year age interval (0 - 4, to 85+&#xD;
      years). Raw age-specific (5-years classes) and age-standardised (age-adjusted) rates were&#xD;
      calculated per 100,000 inhabitants. For raw rates the denominator was the resident population&#xD;
      census at 31st December of each year, available online at the official site of Cremona&#xD;
      province. An age-standardized rate (ASR) is a weighted average of the age-specific (raw)&#xD;
      rate, where the weight is the proportion of individuals in the corresponding age group of a&#xD;
      standard population. Age-standardised rates were calculated using the standard age-structure&#xD;
      of the European (EU) and World (W) standard population. This corrects the potential&#xD;
      confounding effect derived from the differences in age between different populations. The&#xD;
      trend of incidence, expressed as &quot;Annual Percent Change&quot; (APC) was evaluated using Join Point&#xD;
      (National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD) in order to identify significant changes. Overall&#xD;
      survival analysis was carried out by Kaplan-Meier methods and statistically significant&#xD;
      differences were evaluated by Log-Rank Test . Survival hazard ratio was evaluated by Cox&#xD;
      regression model, subsequently the testing of the proportion of hazard. Cumulative risks and&#xD;
      other variables, including age at diagnosis, anatomical subsite, morphology of the tumour,&#xD;
      TNM stage at diagnosis, presence of HP infection, HER-2 amplification status, 5-year survival&#xD;
      and 1-year mortality rate were reported too. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize&#xD;
      the data and parametric and non-parametric tests were used to evaluate differences between&#xD;
      groups. Statistical analysis was carried out by STATA 13 software package (Texas, USA). A&#xD;
      p-value less than 0.05 vas considered as statistically significant.&#xD;

        PATIENTS ELEGIBILY : Any patients age at GC cancer diagnosis was included. Male and female&#xD;
        patients were either included. Healthy volunteers were not included. At the time of&#xD;
        diagnosis of cancer patients must be a province of Cremona inhabitants (districts of Crema,&#xD;
        Cremona or Casalmaggiore). Informed consent signature was required.&#xD;
&#xD;
        TUMOR ELEGIBLY: Diagnosis must be performed from 2010 Juanuary, the 1st to 2013 December,&#xD;
        31st .The diagnosis must be of a infiltrating malignant tumor. The diagnosis should be of a&#xD;
        primary tumor. Precancerous diagnosis were not considered. Recidivate tumor were not&#xD;
        considered. The site of localization of the tumor at diagnosis must be stomach or gastro -&#xD;
        esophageal junction as site of tumor onset.&#xD;
&#xD;
        HDGC ELEGIBILY : Gastric cancer is a known manifestation of inherited cancer predisposition&#xD;
        syndromes similar to hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer and Li-Fraumeni syndrome.&#xD;
        According to the OMIM database, more than 90 per cent of gastric cancers are sporadic,&#xD;
        whereas less than 10 per cent are hereditary (HDGC). Germline E-cadherin inactivating&#xD;
        mutations in the CDH1 gene are responsible for the development of GC in approximately 30%&#xD;
        of families with the hereditary diffuse gastric cancer syndrome (HDGC). Diagnostic criteria&#xD;
        for HDGC are formulated by the International Gastric Cancer Linkage Consortium in 1999 and&#xD;
        then they are reviewed in 2010. In order to individuate HDGC case and to included them in a&#xD;
        specialist counselling and CDH-1 gene mutation evaluation, criteria by International GC&#xD;
        Linkage Consortium 2010 guidelines were followed.&#xD;
