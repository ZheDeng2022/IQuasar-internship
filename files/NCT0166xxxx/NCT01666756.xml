      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of Chinese herbal formulation&#xD;
      PHY906 when given together with sorafenib tosylate in treating patients with advanced liver&#xD;
      cancer. Biological therapies, such as Chinese herbal formulation PHY906, may interfere with&#xD;
      the growth of tumor cells and slow the growth of tumors. Sorafenib tosylate may stop the&#xD;
      growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Sorafenib&#xD;
      tosylate may also stop the growth of liver cancer by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving&#xD;
      Chinese herbal formulation PHY906 together with sorafenib tosylate may work better in&#xD;
      treating advanced liver cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To characterize the safety and tolerability of KD018 (Chinese herbal formulation PHY906)&#xD;
      in combination with daily sorafenib (sorafenib tosylate) and to determine the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination of KD018 plus sorafenib to bring forward into phase&#xD;
      2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To describe the efficacy of the combination of KD018 plus sorafenib at the explored&#xD;
      dose-levels in terms of best overall response as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in&#xD;
      Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the safety and tolerability of the combination of KD018 plus sorafenib as&#xD;
      measured by the rate and severity of adverse events (AEs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the steady state of sorafenib after KD018 exposure at pre-dose and 1 hour&#xD;
      and 2 hours post-dose at the explored combination dose-levels using concentrations at&#xD;
      pre-dose (Cmin) and at 1 hour (C1h) and 2 hours (C2h) post-dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the effect of treatment on soluble markers of angiogenesis, fibroblast growth&#xD;
      factor (FGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), placental growth factor (PLGF),&#xD;
      soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (sVEGFR1), sVEGFR2, apoptosis (i.e. M30&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody [M30] and M65) and on the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) axis including&#xD;
      molecules such as IGF-binding protein 2 (IGFII).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To correlate the above soluble biomarker measurements with clinical endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To examine the correlation between the soluble biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To examine the predictive relationship of immunohistochemical tumor biomarkers at&#xD;
      baseline, i.e. phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 kinase (pS6), p-protein kinase B (pAKT),&#xD;
      p-mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (ERK), p-mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (pMEK),&#xD;
      hypoxia-inducible factor 2, alpha subunit (HIF2a), phosphatase and tensin homolog gene&#xD;
      (PTEN), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (acute-phase response factor)&#xD;
      (STAT3) and tumor protein p53 (p53), as well as of mutational status, i.e. p53,&#xD;
      phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA) and PTEN,&#xD;
      with efficacy endpoints (time to progression [TTP]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To determine if soluble apoptosis markers (M30/M65) correlate with proliferative markers&#xD;
      at baseline (proliferation-related Ki-67 antigen [Ki67] and p53) in archival tumor samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To examine the relationship of immunohistochemical and/or soluble biomarkers with&#xD;
      subgroup classification namely, patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV), patients with&#xD;
      hepatitis C virus (HCV) and patients with other etiologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To explore potential biomarker differences within patient subgroups, namely, patients&#xD;
      with HBV, patients with HCV and patients with other etiologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. To determine the effect of KD018 on cytokine/chemokine levels including interleukin&#xD;
      (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1), tumor necrosis&#xD;
      factor (TNF)-alpha, interferon (IFN)-alpha, VEGF, FGF-basic (b), sargramostim (GM-CSF),&#xD;
      filgrastim (G-CSF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IX. To explore potential relationships between efficacy and Cmin of sorafenib after&#xD;
      co-administration with KD018 and between occurrence of adverse events and C1h/C2h endpoints&#xD;
      (efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics [PK]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of Chinese herbal formulation PHY906.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive Chinese herbal formulation PHY906 orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-4,&#xD;
      8-11, 15-18, 21-24 and sorafenib tosylate PO BID on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days&#xD;
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.&#xD;
