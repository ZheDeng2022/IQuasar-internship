  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Certain cancers require the amino acid arginine. Arginine deiminase (ADI) is an enzyme from&#xD;
      microbes that degrades arginine. ADI has been formulated with polyethylene glycol, and has&#xD;
      been used to treat patients that have cancers that require arginine. In this study, ADI will&#xD;
      be combined with the well known chemotherapy cisplatin, and the safety and potential efficacy&#xD;
      of this combination will be explored in patients with cancers that require arginine.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Histologically confirmed diagnosis of advanced solid tumor (dose escalation component)&#xD;
             or metastatic melanoma (uveal or cutaneous) (doses escalation and MTD expansion&#xD;
             components) or platinum-resistant (tumor progression within a year after the&#xD;
             completion of platinum-based therapy) ovarian carcinoma (high grade serous,&#xD;
             endometrial or poorly differentiated endometrioid) or HCC that has failed treatment&#xD;
             with sorafenib or did not tolerate sorafenib or refused sorafenib, or HCC with&#xD;
             coexistent BCT that has or has not been treated with chemotherapy, or BCT that has or&#xD;
             has not been treated with chemotherapy. For HCC and HCC with coexistent BCT, cirrhotic&#xD;
             status of Child-Pugh grade A-B7 must be present. Child-Pugh status should be&#xD;
             determined based on clinical findings and laboratory data during the screening period&#xD;
             (Appendix C). Subjects on anti-coagulants are to receive 1 point for their INR status,&#xD;
             as they are presumed to have a &lt;1.7 baseline PT/INR.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Ovarian cancer, or HCC, or HCC with coexistent BCT, or BCT only tissue either from an&#xD;
             archived specimen or from a new biopsy of sufficient amount and quality should be&#xD;
             available for IHC determination of ASS status to be performed retrospectively for the&#xD;
             ovarian cancer, or HCC, or HCC with coexistent BCT, or BCT only cohorts. Subjects with&#xD;
             no tissue available would require a biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Unresectable disease or patient refused surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Progressive disease if treated with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery or&#xD;
             immunotherapy. If prior radiation was given, the measurable disease should be outside&#xD;
             the radiation port. Unequivocal progression of HCC/BTC lesions previously treated with&#xD;
             catheter-based therapy including transarterial chemoembolization or radioembolization&#xD;
             is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Measurable disease as assessed by RECIST 1.1 criteria (Appendix A).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Age ≥ 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. ECOG performance status of 0 - 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. No prior systemic therapy, immunotherapy, investigational agent, chemoembolization,&#xD;
             radioembolization or radiation therapy within the last 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Fully recovered from any prior surgery and no major surgery within 4 weeks of&#xD;
             initiating treatment, except for gamma knife which can take place within 2 weeks.&#xD;
             Surgery for placement of vascular access devices is acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Serious infection requiring treatment with systemically administered antibiotics at&#xD;
             the time of study entrance, or an infection requiring systemic antibiotic therapy&#xD;
             within 7 days prior to the first dose of study treatment. For the HCC, HCC/BTC and BTC&#xD;
             subgroups hepatitis C infection and hepatitis B infection if controlled with antiviral&#xD;
             therapy are allowable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Pregnancy or lactation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Expected non-compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association Class III&#xD;
             or IV), cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness, social situations that would limit&#xD;
             compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects who have had any anticancer treatment prior to entering the study and have&#xD;
             not recovered to baseline (except alopecia) or ≤ Grade 1 AEs, or deemed irreversible&#xD;
             from the effects of prior cancer therapy. AEs &gt; Grade 1 that are not considered a&#xD;
             safety risk by the Sponsor and investigator may be allowed upon agreement with both.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects with history of another primary cancer, including co-existent second&#xD;
             malignancy, with the exception of: a) curatively resected non-melanoma skin cancer; b)&#xD;
             curatively treated cervical carcinoma in situ; or c) other primary solid tumor with no&#xD;
             known active disease present in the opinion of the investigator will not affect&#xD;
             patient outcome in the setting of current cancer diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subjects who had been treated with ADI-PEG 20 previously.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. History of seizure disorder not related to underlying cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Known HIV positivity (testing not required).&#xD;
