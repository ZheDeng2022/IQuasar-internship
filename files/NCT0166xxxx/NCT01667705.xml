      -  Rationale: Recently, research that demonstrates a clear relationship between the built&#xD;
           healthcare environment and the health and wellbeing of patients has come available.&#xD;
           Patients in a CT scan suite are usually anxious. The environment has been shown to lower&#xD;
           stress; a painting or piece of art for example, can capture and hold attention and&#xD;
           thereby lower negative thoughts and evoke positive emotions. Sights of nature have&#xD;
           demonstrated to be especially effective in recuperating from stress, presumably because&#xD;
           the human brain has evolved in a natural environment. The current study will investigate&#xD;
           the effects of exposure to nature in the CT scan suite. A SkyCeiling, a large, slightly&#xD;
           illuminated, photographic illusion of a real sky view is placed above the CT scan. The&#xD;
           main hypothesis of this study is that a sky view will lead to a lower level of anxiety&#xD;
           in the CT scan suite.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Objective: The primary objective of this study is to examine the effect of a view of&#xD;
           nature on a patient's stress and anxiety. Secondary objectives are to study the effects&#xD;
           of a view of nature on a patient's environmental appraisals of the CT suite,&#xD;
           satisfaction with the provided service, and trust in the healthcare provider.&#xD;

      1. INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE&#xD;
&#xD;
           The importance and the potential benefits of well-designed healthcare facilities have&#xD;
           been widely acknowledged and recent research clearly demonstrates the relationship&#xD;
           between the built healthcare environment and patients' health and well-being (Dijkstra,&#xD;
           2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Encounters with healthcare situations are generally characterized by fear, anxiety,&#xD;
           stress, and uncertainty (Mitchell, 2003; Pearson, Maddern, &amp; Fitridge, 2005). Looking at&#xD;
           most environments in which these encounters take place, one might rightfully ask how&#xD;
           well these healthcare environments satisfy the psychological needs of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In order to create more beneficial environments, environmental stimuli can be added to&#xD;
           (or removed from) the environment to influence the patient in a positive manner. The&#xD;
           environment may elicit positive feelings, hold attention and interest, and block or&#xD;
           reduce negative thoughts, for example, by the presence of art or a view from a window&#xD;
           (R. S. Ulrich, 1984). The purpose of the present study is to improve patients'&#xD;
           well-being by adding positive elements to existing healthcare environments, such as&#xD;
           pictures of nature.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Stress is an important factor in healthcare situations and stress reactions can be&#xD;
           considered a clinical problem since they often result in negative or worsened medical&#xD;
           outcomes (Malkin, 2008). Previous studies (Volicer &amp; Volicer, 1978), for example, found&#xD;
           that hospital stress was correlated with changes in heart rate and blood pressure. Other&#xD;
           studies showed that psychological stress impairs wound healing in patients (Christian,&#xD;
           Graham, Padgett, Glaser, &amp; Kiecolt-Glaser, 2006; Kiecolt-Glaser, Marucha, Malarkey,&#xD;
           Mercado, &amp; Glaser, 1995). Elbrecht and colleagues (Elbrecht et al., 2004) studied the&#xD;
           effects of perceived stress and cortisol levels on wound healing and demonstrated a&#xD;
           considerable negative effect of stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Rabin (2004 in Malkin 2008; personal communication 2008) proposed that pleasant&#xD;
           healthcare environments are those that are perceived by the brain as calming, meaning&#xD;
           that the stress reactive areas of the brain decrease their activity with a resultant&#xD;
           decrease in the concentration of cortisol and norepinephrine in the blood. This results&#xD;
           in patients experiencing less pain, having more restful sleep, less anger, less muscle&#xD;
           tension, and a lower risk of stroke. Furthermore, Kaplan and Kaplan (R. Kaplan &amp; Kaplan,&#xD;
           1989) state that &quot;the nervous system seems to be structured in such a way that pleasure&#xD;
           and pain tend to inhibit each other&quot;. A more pleasant healthcare environment could,&#xD;
           therefore, result in less stress and anxiety in patients and this should lead to better&#xD;
           health and increased feelings of well-being. When speaking about a more pleasant&#xD;
           healthcare environment, a wide variety of environmental characteristics come to mind.&#xD;
           Variables such as indoor plants and music could help create environments that generate&#xD;
           positive feelings and, as a consequence, reduce negative outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Nonpharmacological anti-anxiety interventions The advantage of using environmental&#xD;
           interventions to lower anxiety is that these kind of interventions do not carry any risk&#xD;
           and are not time consuming. Several studies have examined various methods of anxiety&#xD;
           reduction in healthcare environments. For example, research has demonstrated the&#xD;
           beneficial effects of scents on anxiety and mood in dental patients (Lehrner,&#xD;
           Eckersberger, Walla, Poetsch, &amp; Deecke, 2000; Lehrner, Marwinski, Lehr, Johren, &amp;&#xD;
           Deecke, 2005) Furthermore, music therapy has successfully been applied to reduce pain&#xD;
           and anxiety in patients undergoing various medical procedures, such as children with&#xD;
           cancer undergoing lumbar puncture (Thanh Nhan, Nilsson, Hellstr√∂m, &amp; Bengtson, 2010) and&#xD;
           women during caesarian delivery (Chang &amp; Chen, 2005). Sunlight appeared to have&#xD;
           beneficial effects on perceived stress (Walch et al., 2005). A recent study (Park &amp;&#xD;
           Mattson, 2009) demonstrated that indoor plants in a hospital room can have therapeutic&#xD;
           value and serve as a noninvasive and effective complementary medicine for surgical&#xD;
           patients. Esthetic enhancements can thus provide unobtrusive and inexpensive stress and&#xD;
           anxiety management methods. In this study we propose nature as an anti-anxiety&#xD;
           intervention, which possibly has an even stronger effect on anxiety then scent, daylight&#xD;
           or music.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Nature interventions Research on restorative environments suggests that certain&#xD;
           environments are capable of promoting recovery from stress. Especially natural settings&#xD;
           have these restorative effects (Hartig, Book, Garvill, Olsson, &amp; Garling, 1996).&#xD;
           Considering the potential healing properties of nature (Lohr &amp; Pearson-Mims, 2000; R. S.&#xD;
           Ulrich, 1984), exposing patients to natural elements may be an effective way of reducing&#xD;
           stress. A recent review concluded that viewing nature scenes may decrease pain&#xD;
           perceptions by eliciting positive emotional responses and decreasing stress (Malenbaum,&#xD;
           Keefe, Williams, Ulrich, &amp; Somers, 2008).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Ulrich et al. (R. Ulrich et al., 1991) studied the effects of exposure to nature on&#xD;
           stress recovery. Participants watched a videotape that induced feelings of stress, and&#xD;
           were afterwards exposed to a tape with either a natural or an urban environment. Results&#xD;
           demonstrated that individuals recover sooner from stress when exposed to the former&#xD;
           (natural) than the latter (urban). Lohr and Pearson-Mims (2000) studied whether the&#xD;
           presence of indoor plants would increase pain tolerance. Participants were either placed&#xD;
           in a room with plants, a room with non-plant objects (as visually distractive as the&#xD;
           plants), or a control room (no objects). Results showed that a significantly larger&#xD;
           proportion of respondents in the room with plants were able to keep their hand in the&#xD;
           ice water for 5 minutes as compared to the other conditions, suggesting increased pain&#xD;
           tolerance by exposure to indoor plants. They also showed that the room with plants was&#xD;
           rated more positively (e.g., cheerful, calming, pleasant) than either of the control&#xD;
           rooms. The results of these studies support the idea that nature may have beneficial&#xD;
           effects on the health and well-being of people.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Natural elements in the built environment have clearly shown stress-reducing properties,&#xD;
           but it is still unclear which underlying mechanism causes this stress-reduction. A&#xD;
           potential explanation lies in the theories by Kaplan (S. Kaplan, 1987) and Ulrich (R. S.&#xD;
           Ulrich, 1983), which state that people have a tendency to prefer natural settings to&#xD;
           built environments. Although these two theories have some important differences (see&#xD;
           Hartig et al. (1996) for a discussion), both are based on the same evolutionary&#xD;
           assumptions. The preferences for natural settings are assumed to have an evolutionary&#xD;
           base; people are to some extent biologically adapted to natural as opposed to built&#xD;
           environments. Secondly, it might be argued that nature may be processed more easily and&#xD;
           efficiently because the brain and sensory systems evolved in natural environments&#xD;
           (Wohlwill, 1983). As a result, humans have an innate tendency to pay attention and&#xD;
           respond positively to natural elements (Ulrich et al., 1991). This predisposition to&#xD;
           prefer natural elements to man-made objects may be the explanation of the&#xD;
           stress-reducing effects of nature. It might thus be hypothesized that natural elements&#xD;
           affect feelings of stress through the perceived attractiveness of an environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In a laboratory experiment, Dijkstra et al. (Dijkstra, Pieterse, &amp; Pruyn, 2008) tested&#xD;
           this hypothesis and demonstrated the stress-reducing properties of indoor plants in a&#xD;
           simulated hospital room. Moreover, this effect was mediated by the perceived&#xD;
           attractiveness of the hospital room. The presence of indoor plants in a hospital&#xD;
           resulted in participants perceiving the room as more attractive, which in turn resulted&#xD;
           in less perceived stress. Considering the potential infection risks of real plants,&#xD;
           Dijkstra (Dijkstra, 2009) conducted a second experiment in a figurative painting of a&#xD;
           tree was added to a patient room. This second experiment re-confirmed the&#xD;
           stress-reducing properties of nature, and replicated the mediating effect of perceived&#xD;
           attractiveness on stress. Furthermore, stress is not only reduced by indoor plants, but&#xD;
           by a painting of nature as well. An association task revealed that, next to indoor&#xD;
           plants, a painting of a tree also activated the concept of nature. This suggests that a&#xD;
           mere association with nature could potentially lead to beneficial effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Taken together, nature interventions have shown to be beneficial in a variety of&#xD;
           settings. This includes both real and simulated nature interventions. Applying such&#xD;
           nature interventions in the CT scan suite might thus lead to beneficial effects in&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research project aims to gain insight in how the physical environment of the CT scan&#xD;
      suite affects patients' health and well-being. Patients undergoing procedures in a CT scan&#xD;
      suite are often anxious and frightened. Stress reactions can be considered a clinical problem&#xD;
      since they often result in negative or worsened medical outcomes. Reduction in state anxiety&#xD;
      may help to promote relaxation, which in turn is beneficial for a patient's sense of&#xD;
      well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: to determine whether a skyceiling lowers stress and anxiety during&#xD;
      diagnostic procedures in a CT scan suite.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective(s): to determine whether a skyceiling improves environmental appraisals,&#xD;
      mood, satisfaction with the provided service, time perception, and trust in the healthcare&#xD;
      provider.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Able to read and write Dutch&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to observe the visual stimuli applied to the ceiling, i.e. normal vision or&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have undergone a CT scan after the SkyCeiling was installed (this is a&#xD;
             rare event) are excluded. This because of the fact that these patients might remember&#xD;
             the look of the CT unit either with or without the SkyCeiling and could thus become&#xD;
             more aware of the intended anxiety-reducing effect of the intervention, or the lack&#xD;
