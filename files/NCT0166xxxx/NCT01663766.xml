      This study will assess the safety and tolerability of milatuzumab (IMMU-115) when added to a&#xD;
      standard regimen to prevent Graft vs. Host Disease (GVHD) in patients with hematologic&#xD;
      malignancies undergoing stem cell transplant.&#xD;

    <measure>All patients administered any dose of study drug will be included in the evaluation of safety</measure>
    <time_frame>Safety will be assessed by measuring the change from baseline during 7 days of treatment and up to 30 days after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Safety will be measured by physical examinations and hematology and chemistry blood tests. Cardiac safety will be done using MUGA scans or echocardiograms. These assessments will be done routinely during treatment and up to 30 days after treatment and any change from baseline will be assessed. Long term safety will be assessed every 3 months after that for up to 1 year; any change from baseline will be assessed.</description>
