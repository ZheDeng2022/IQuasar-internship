    <textblock>
      Cancer patients with pain due to bone metastases are often treated with external irradiation&#xD;
      in order to reduce pain. However, patients may experience a temporary increase of pain&#xD;
      shortly after irradiation, a so-called pain flare. This study investigates whether a short&#xD;
      course of a drug called dexamethasone may prevent the occurrence of a pain flare. Patients,&#xD;
      who are irradiated for painful bone metastases are randomized into three groups. Group 1&#xD;
      receives placebo during four days, group 2 receives dexamethasone on the day of the&#xD;
      irradiation and placebo during three days, and group 3 receives dexamethasone during four&#xD;
      days. All patients complete a questionnaire on pain, side-effects of treatment and quality of&#xD;
      life during 14 days and after four weeks. This study will define whether dexamethasone&#xD;
      decreases the occurrence of a pain flare after irradiation for painful bone metastases, and,&#xD;
      if so, whether four days of treatment with dexamethasone is better dan one day of treatment.&#xD;

      Background of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with pain due to bone metastases are often treated with palliative short schedule&#xD;
      external beam radiotherapy. Dependent on the institutional protocols, single fraction (8 Gy)&#xD;
      or 5-6 fractions of 4 Gy are usually applied. Randomized studies have shown the equal&#xD;
      effectiveness of both schedules in treating pain, with almost 70% of patients experiencing&#xD;
      less or no pain within three to four weeks after treatment (Wu 2003). However, within 10 days&#xD;
      after treatment a short term transient progression of pain may occur, the so-called pain&#xD;
      flare (Chow 2005, Loblaw 2007, Hird 2009-1). Two prospective observational studies reported&#xD;
      patient-based daily pain scores after radiotherapy for painful bone metastases. Loblaw showed&#xD;
      a pain flare in 44% patients after 8 Gy and in 24% patients after 20 Gy in 4 fractions&#xD;
      (Loblaw 2007). The median duration of the pain flare was three days. A recent publication&#xD;
      found no difference in pain flare in 111 patients after single vs. multiple fractions (39%&#xD;
      vs. 41%, resp.) (Hird 2009-1). No data are available of the occurrence of pain flare in Dutch&#xD;
      patients. The largest trial to date on painful bone metastases, the Dutch Bone Metastasis&#xD;
      Study, was funded by OG and CKTO and randomized from 1996-1998 a total of 1157 patients&#xD;
      between 8 Gy single fraction and 24 Gy in 6 fractions (PhD thesis, van der Linden 2005).&#xD;
      Follow-up consisted of 12 weekly and thereafter monthly questionnaires on pain, pain&#xD;
      medication and quality of life. In this study, daily scoring of pain to asses pain flare was&#xD;
      not performed. When a pain flare occurs oral dexamethasone can be prescribed. The rationale&#xD;
      for administering steroids is to decrease edema that arises in the periostium of the affected&#xD;
      bone shortly after radiotherapy and thereby to reduce pain (de Graeff 2006). Two small&#xD;
      studies were performed to study the effectiveness of dexamethasone for treating a pain flare&#xD;
      (Chow 2007, Hird 2009-2). Chow et al. administered 8 mg dexamethasone to 23 patients one hour&#xD;
      before single fraction treatment and showed pain flare in only 24% of patients (95% CI&#xD;
      10-39%) within the first 10 days after radiotherapy (Chow 2007). Only one patient had a flare&#xD;
      within two days after treatment. Dexamethasone was well tolerated. In a fase 2 study of the&#xD;
      same research group 41 patients were administered 8 mg dexamethasone before and then for&#xD;
      three consecutive days after single fraction treatment. They showed a pain flare in 22% of&#xD;
      patients (with a median duration of one day), with 81% occurring within five days after&#xD;
      treatment, and 95% within 10 days (Hird 2009-2). Both studies concluded that randomized&#xD;
      studies are necessary to collect unbiased data on the occurrence and duration of pain flare&#xD;
      and the effectiveness of drug treatment. Until now, no randomized studies were performed&#xD;
      comparing dexamethasone with placebo or no treatment. The effectiveness of placebo vs.&#xD;
      dexamethasone in the treatment of pain flare in patients after radiotherapy for painful bone&#xD;
      metastases is the subject of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study To study the effectiveness and toxicity of dexamethasone to prevent the&#xD;
      occurrence of a pain flare after short schedule radiotherapy for painful bone metastases and&#xD;
      to define the optimal schedule of dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. What is the effectiveness of dexamethasone to prevent the occurrence of a pain flare&#xD;
           after short schedule radiotherapy for painful bone metastases?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Is there a difference in effectiveness between a single dose of 8 mg dexamethasone&#xD;
           before radiotherapy or a dose of 8 mg dexamethasone before radiotherapy in combination&#xD;
           with three additional doses during the three following days?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. What are the side effects of dexamethasone and placebo in patients treated with&#xD;
           radiotherapy for painful bone metastases? 4. Does a pain flare predict for pain response&#xD;
           to radiotherapy?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a randomized, controlled, multicenter study in 411 patients with painful bone&#xD;
      metastases who are referred for a short course of palliative radiotherapy. Short course&#xD;
      radiotherapy encompasses all treatment schedules from one to six fractions of radiotherapy.&#xD;
      The study consists of three arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 1: day 0: placebo, day 1, 2 en 3: placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 2: day 0: 8 mg dexamethasone, day 1, 2 en 3: placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 3: day 0: 8 mg dexamethasone, day 1, 2 en 3: 8 mg dexamethasone Day 0 is the first&#xD;
           day of radiotherapy treatment. On day 0 the tablet of placebo or dexamethasone will be&#xD;
           administered one hour before radiotherapy. On day 1, 2, and 3 the tablet of placebo or&#xD;
           dexamethasone will be taken in the morning at about 8 a.m.&#xD;

    <description>A pain flare is defined by a two-point increase after radiotherapy of the worst pain score on Pain flare is defined as an 11-point scale of 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst imaginable pain) compared to baseline without a decrease in analgesic intake, or a 25% increase in analgesic intake without decrease in worst pain score (according to international bone metastases consensus guidelines) (Chow 2007).</description>
