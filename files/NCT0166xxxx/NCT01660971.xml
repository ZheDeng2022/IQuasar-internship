    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of gemcitabine hydrochloride and&#xD;
      dasatinib when given together with erlotinib hydrochloride in treating patients with&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer that has spread to other places in the body or cannot be removed by&#xD;
      surgery. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine hydrochloride, work in different&#xD;
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from&#xD;
      dividing. Dasatinib and erlotinib hydrochloride may stop the growth of tumor cells by&#xD;
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving gemcitabine hydrochloride and&#xD;
      dasatinib together with erlotinib hydrochloride may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (also phase II recommended dose) of the&#xD;
      combination of gemcitabine (gemcitabine hydrochloride), erlotinib (erlotinib hydrochloride)&#xD;
      and dasatinib in patients with advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety profile of the combination of gemcitabine, erlotinib and&#xD;
      dasatinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the response rate and response duration of advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma&#xD;
      treated with dasatinib, erlotinib and gemcitabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine progression-free survival and overall survival for this group of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine the utility of advanced magnetic resonance imaging techniques to assess in&#xD;
      vivo effects of therapy (changes in tumor vascularity, cellularity).&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To assess the use of serum markers as predictors of response and outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of gemcitabine hydrochloride and dasatinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes on days 1,&#xD;
      8, and 15, and dasatinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) and erlotinib hydrochloride PO QD on&#xD;
      days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days and then every 4&#xD;
      weeks thereafter.&#xD;
