  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether healthy older adults, aged 65 to 80 years,&#xD;
      consuming a probiotic each day for three weeks will have improved immune strength and&#xD;
      digestive health. It is hypothesized that older adults consuming the probiotics will see a&#xD;
      shift in their microbiota towards the &quot;healthy&quot; bacteria resulting in a greater proportion of&#xD;
      immune cells, decreased inflammation, and better digestive health.&#xD;

      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled crossover design with two 3-week&#xD;
      interventions and a 5-week washout period in between. Thirty-six participants will be&#xD;
      enrolled. With informed consent, the daily questionnaire will be administered and a baseline&#xD;
      stool sample will be obtained during the week before the start of each intervention period.&#xD;
      Blood and saliva will be collected on the first and last day of each intervention period to&#xD;
      assess immune function. A final stool sample will be obtained in the last week of the&#xD;
      intervention period. Nutritional status, which can impact immune function, will be assessed&#xD;
      using the Mini-Nutritional Assessment, Block Fiber Screen, and the Block 2005 Food Frequency&#xD;
      Questionnaire. Daily questionnaires will record intake of the probiotic or placebo, level of&#xD;
      stress, hours of sleep, visits to the physician, new medications, number of stools, etc. The&#xD;
      Gastrointestinal Symptom Response Scale, which records gastrointestinal symptoms, such as&#xD;
      bloating, gas, diarrhea, and constipation, over the past week will be completed at baseline&#xD;
      and weekly during the interventions and the week following the interventions.&#xD;
