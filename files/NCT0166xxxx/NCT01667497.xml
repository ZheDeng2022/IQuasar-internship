    <textblock>
      Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients often complain of cognitive fatigue. There is currently no&#xD;
      treatment for this symptom. Fampridine SR is a recently approved medication that improves&#xD;
      walking ability and walking speed in MS patients. It is thought that it might have the same&#xD;
      positive effect on cognitive fatigue. This study will compare fampridine 10mg twice a day to&#xD;
      placebo in order to determine if there is any benefit of this medication for cognitive&#xD;
      fatigue in MS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fampridine-SR (4-aminopyridine) is a slow release oral medication that acts as a selective&#xD;
      neuronal potassium-channel blocker. It has been investigated in several multiple sclerosis&#xD;
      (MS) studies and has been shown to improve ambulation, fatigue, and endurance. The hypothesis&#xD;
      for the mode of action of fampridine in MS patients is based on the fact that demyelinated&#xD;
      axons do not effectively conduct action potentials partly due to abnormal potassium currents&#xD;
      that contribute to conduction failure by decreasing action potential duration and amplitude.&#xD;
      Thus, potassium channel blockers such as 4-aminopyridine or 3,4 diaminopyridine improve nerve&#xD;
      impulse propagation by enhancing action potential formation, improving conduction and&#xD;
      preventing conduction block. In a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo controlled&#xD;
      phase III trial, 301 patients were treated with either fampridine (10 mg BID n=229) or&#xD;
      placebo (n=72). Consistent improvement on the timed 25 foot walk (T25FW) was the primary&#xD;
      outcome measure. The proportion who improved on the T25FW was higher in the fampridine than&#xD;
      placebo group (35% vs. 8%; p&lt;0.0001). This data shows that fampridine improves walking speed&#xD;
      in MS. Additionally, the study suggested there is a &quot;responder effect&quot; meaning MS subjects&#xD;
      who respond to the medication respond very well (timed walk responder), while others do not&#xD;
      show any beneficial response (timed walk non-responder). A responder was defined as an&#xD;
      increase in walking speed, compared to placebo run-in, for at least 3 of 4 assessments while&#xD;
      on treatment during the trial. However, this study demonstrated that responders could be&#xD;
      identified as early as the first and second week after the initiation of treatment, as there&#xD;
      was a significant difference between responders and non-responders at this time point. After&#xD;
      discontinuation of fampridine, T25FW scores returned to baseline within one week&#xD;
&#xD;
      MS and Cognitive Fatigue It is estimated that 43-60% of patients with MS have cognitive&#xD;
      dysfunction and studies using objective neuropsychological (NP) tests have consistently shown&#xD;
      impairment in speed of information processing and sustained attention. Further, MS patients&#xD;
      complain of &quot;cognitive fatigue&quot;, a symptom that may or may not be associated with&#xD;
      generalized/central fatigue. Cognitive fatigue has been defined as a decline in cognitive&#xD;
      performance during a task requiring sustained cognitive activity. Although generalized or&#xD;
      motor/muscle fatigue has been shown to affect the subjective assessment of cognitive&#xD;
      performance, it does not affect performance on objective cognitive measures. In contrast,&#xD;
      cognitive fatigue has been demonstrated in MS patients on objective neuropsychological tests.&#xD;
      Kujala et al (1995) examined MS patients with and without mild cognitive impairment on a task&#xD;
      of sustained attention. Both groups declined over time while healthy controls did not. Krupp&#xD;
      et al (2000) administered a verbal learning/memory task twice separated by a continuous&#xD;
      cognitively effortful task involving processing speed and attention. Normal controls&#xD;
      demonstrated an increase in number of words recalled (+2.6) on the 2nd test administration,&#xD;
      as expected due to a practice effect. In contrast, the MS subjects showed a decrease in test&#xD;
      scores (-1.8) on the 2nd test administration. This difference was found despite both groups&#xD;
      subjectively reporting an increase in mental fatigue over the testing period. Finally, Schwid&#xD;
      et al (2003) examined the decline in performance on the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test&#xD;
      (PASAT), a measure of processing speed and sustained attention. There was a 5.3-5.8% decline&#xD;
      in correct responses when comparing the MS subjects' performance at the beginning vs. the end&#xD;
      of the test. Normal controls did not show a significant decrease in performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treating MS Associated Cognitive Impairment and Cognitive Fatigue Currently approved MS&#xD;
      specific medications have been shown to affect physical disability, relapse rate and MRI&#xD;
      progression in MS subjects but cognition, fatigue and cognitive fatigue have not been the&#xD;
      main focus of any of these studies. Further, symptomatic treatments for generalized fatigue&#xD;
      have not focused on cognitive fatigue. Studies of l-amphetamine found a positive response on&#xD;
      measures of processing speed in a small sample of MS subjects, but a larger, multi-centered&#xD;
      placebo controlled trial by Morrow et al did not find any significant benefit. Cognitive&#xD;
      fatigue was not specifically addressed in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aminopyridines and Cognition in the MS Population Only two previous studies have addressed&#xD;
      the effect of aminopyridines on cognition in MS subjects. In one study, no benefit was found.&#xD;
      It is important to note that the primary aim of the study was to examine changes in&#xD;
      generalized fatigue and the cognitive outcomes were tertiary outcomes only. Further, the&#xD;
      measure of attention used has not been validated in the MS population. In the other study,&#xD;
      performance on Rao's Brief Repeatable Neuropsychological Battery (BRN-B) before and after&#xD;
      treatment with 4-aminopyridine was compared. A trend was found for improvement on measures of&#xD;
      verbal learning and on the PASAT 2.0 second version, but the findings were not statistically&#xD;
      significant. However the trial was underpowered, with only 20 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summary Cognitive impairment and cognitive fatigue are common in MS yet there are no&#xD;
      currently effective treatments for these debilitating symptoms. Based on the proposed&#xD;
      mechanism of action of fampridine, it is probable that it will improve cognitive fatigue in&#xD;
      MS by improving nerve conduction. Using a placebo controlled cross-over study with a two week&#xD;
      washout period in between, changes on tests of attention and processing speed under the two&#xD;
      conditions can be compared. Since cognitive impairment is the leading cause of work&#xD;
      disability, as well as having an negative impact on social activities and relationships,&#xD;
      improving cognitive fatigue will contribute positively to the quality of life of MS patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine if fampridine SR 10mg BID has a beneficial effect on cognitive fatigue in MS&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design and Duration&#xD;
&#xD;
      The design is a cross-over, placebo controlled, double-blind study with four weeks of&#xD;
      treatment for drug (fampridine 10mg BID) and placebo separated by a one week washout period.&#xD;
      For each visit subsequent to visit 1, we will encourage subjects to ensure similar&#xD;
      environmental and behavioural compartment as the first assessment (i.e. amount of sleep,&#xD;
      caffeine intake etc.) to try to ensure similar testing settings. Additionally, the&#xD;
      assessments will occur at similar times of day as visit 1.&#xD;
