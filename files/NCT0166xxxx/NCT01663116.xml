    <textblock>
      Phase Ib/IIa clinical trial of a new medicinal product of the somatic cell therapy class&#xD;
      (eASCs). This study is designed as a multicenter, single blind, fixed dose escalation, with&#xD;
      three treatment groups, controlled with placebo (randomization 3:1) whose target population&#xD;
      are patients with rheumatoid arthritis refractory to at least two biologic.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Traditionally, RA has been treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,&#xD;
      glucocorticoids and non-biologics-DMARDs. Only non-biologics-DMARDs and, at a lesser extent,&#xD;
      glucocorticoids have shown to be able to prevent or interrupt the inflammatory and&#xD;
      destructive disease processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are nonhematopoietic stromal cells that are able to&#xD;
      differentiate into mesenchymal tissues such as bone, cartilage, muscle, ligament, tendon, and&#xD;
      adipose. MSCs can be easily isolated from bone marrow or adipose tissue and rapidly expanded&#xD;
      in culture. MSCs have also been shown to have immuno-suppressive and healing capacities,&#xD;
      improve angiogenesis and prevent fibrosis. These properties could be used for novel&#xD;
      therapeutic applications in various disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis&#xD;
      (OA), genetic bone and cartilage disorders and bone metastasis. MSCs can potently modulate&#xD;
      immune responses, showing antiproliferative and anti-inflammatory capacities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a multicenter phase Ib/IIa, escalating dose, single blind clinical trial to&#xD;
      assess the safety of the intravenous administration of expanded allogeneic adipose-derived&#xD;
      mesenchymal stem cells (eASCs) to refractory rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to determine the safety, feasibility and tolerance, and&#xD;
      to identify, if possible, the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and the dose for future clinical&#xD;
      trials on efficacy of the intravenous infusion of allogeneic eASCs for patients suffering&#xD;
      rheumatoid arthritis (RA) under treatment with at least one non-biologic-Disease modifying&#xD;
      antirheumatoid drug (DMARD) who have previously failed to treatment with at least two&#xD;
      biologics. The secondary objective is to obtain information on the clinical and functional&#xD;
      effects of the intravenous infusion of allogeneic eASCs in patients with RA and to explore&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      53 patients (i.e. patients having received at least one dose of study treatment) in three&#xD;
      different cohorts are planned to be included in this clinical trial. Expansion will start&#xD;
      after acute toxicity assessment of the first three patients of each cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose and intervals for the trial consist of the following active groups: a) first cohort: 1&#xD;
      million cells/kg administered at days 1, 8 and 15; b) second cohort: 2 million cells / kg&#xD;
      administered at days 1, 8 and 15; c) third cohort: 4 million cells / kg administered at days&#xD;
      1, 8 and 15.&#xD;
