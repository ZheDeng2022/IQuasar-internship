      The study is designed to use infusion of a non-radioactive, naturally occurring isotope of&#xD;
      glucose (13C) in patients undergoing surgical resection for a newly identified brain mass to&#xD;
      obtain the metabolic phenotype of the tumor, and correlate it with the histopathological&#xD;
      diagnosis. In each patient, 13C NMR spectral analysis of tumor extracts will be obtained&#xD;
      after intraoperative infusion of [U-13C]glucose or [1,2-13C]glucose. Whenever feasible,&#xD;
      patients will undergo 3 preoperative imaging studies - 18FDG-PET, diffusion tensor imaging&#xD;
      with 1H-spectroscopy on 3T MR scanner, and ultra high resolution MR imaging on the 7T MR&#xD;
      scanner. The results of these imaging studies will be correlated with the metabolic phenotype&#xD;
      to generate a comprehensive non-invasive view of the tumor with the goal of identifying&#xD;
      infiltrative, metabolically active tumor cells within the brain. In addition, a comprehensive&#xD;
      molecular profile of the tumor will be obtained and enable a genotype-metabolic phenotype&#xD;
      comparative analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Correlative Translational Research The investigators will obtain tumor tissue from each&#xD;
      patient for comprehensive molecular analysis (array CGH, expression profiling, methylation&#xD;
      profiling) which will be correlated with tumor histology, the metabolites identified by 1H-MR&#xD;
      spectroscopy and the 13Cglucose metabolic profile. Patients will be followed at designated&#xD;
      time points along their treatment course to obtain information about ongoing treatment and&#xD;
      response, time to tumor progression and overall survival. These parameters will be used in&#xD;
      correlational analysis with the metabolic phenotype.&#xD;

      The study is designed to obtain tumor samples from patients undergoing clinically indicated&#xD;
      surgical resection of a brain tumor or primary non-CNS tumor after infusion of 13C-glucose,&#xD;
      13C-acetate or 13C-glucose and 13C-acetate. Patients with a brain mass identified on brain&#xD;
      imaging and who need surgical resection of the mass will be eligible for this metabolism&#xD;
      study. Eligible study patients will be screened, recruited, and enrolled at UT Southwestern&#xD;
      Medical Center in the Harold C. Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center, University Hospital -&#xD;
      Zale Lipshy and University Hospital - St. Paul, Children's Medical Center of Dallas as well&#xD;
      as at Parkland Health and Hospital System. We will consent 60 patients, including projected&#xD;
      screen failures and early withdrawals, and anticipate that we will study 25 patients in this&#xD;
      clinical protocol. Once enrolled, patients will undergo a series of preoperative brain&#xD;
      imaging studies including 3T MRI with Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) and 1H-MR spectroscopy,&#xD;
      7T MRI and a brain 18FDG-PET scan within 7-14 days of the scheduled operation. Of these&#xD;
      studies, only the 3T MRI is standard of care. The DTI and 1H-MR spectroscopy are additional&#xD;
      scanning sequences that are being done for research purposes. Similarly, the 7T MRI and the&#xD;
      18FDG-PET are being done for research purposes only. On the day of surgery, the patient will&#xD;
      have a peripheral IV started while waiting in the preoperative holding area and a 20%&#xD;
      solution of either [U-13C]glucose and/or [1,2-13C]acetate (to be determined for each&#xD;
      individual patient by the PI) will be infused at a rate of 4g/hr for a maximum of 4 hours.&#xD;
      During the infusion period, 4 timed blood samples will be collected for NMR analysis of&#xD;
      13C-glucose in the blood. The infusion will continue until the tumor has been resected and&#xD;
      samples have been collected and flash frozen for 13C-NMR spectral analysis and molecular&#xD;
      analyses. The infusion and tumor collection for 13C-NMR analysis is being done for research&#xD;
      purposes only. However, the remainder of the neurosurgical operative and post-operative&#xD;
      procedures will be followed according to standard practice. The patient will be seen 10-14&#xD;
      days after surgery for a follow up visit at which time an assessment of adverse events will&#xD;
      be performed. Thereafter, every 6 months for 5 years or until death, the patient will be&#xD;
      contacted and data regarding treatment, responses, and tumor progression will be collected&#xD;
      for correlative analysis.&#xD;
