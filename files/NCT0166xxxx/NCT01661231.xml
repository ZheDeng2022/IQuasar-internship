    <textblock>
      BIOFLEX-I EU is the European arm of the BIOFLEX-I IDE study (NCT01319812). Data from&#xD;
      BIOFLEX-I EU will be pooled with data in the IDE. The objective of this study is to&#xD;
      separately demonstrate the clinical performance of BIOTRONIK's Astron and Pulsar-18 stents in&#xD;
      the European arm of the BIOFLEX-I IDE (NCT01319812). The Pulsar-18 stent will be used for the&#xD;
      treatment of femoro-popliteal lesions, located in the native superficial femoral artery (SFA)&#xD;
      or proximal popliteal artery (PPA), while the Astron stent will be used for the treatment of&#xD;
      the common or external iliac artery lesions.&#xD;

             ipsilateral, inflow artery (e.g. aortoiliac, common femoral) must be successfully&#xD;
             treated with PTA and/or commercially-available stent just prior to treatment of the&#xD;
             target lesion. Successful treatment is defined as no complications and less than 30%&#xD;
