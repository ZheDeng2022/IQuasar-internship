      The purpose of this stage of study is to establish discriminant among healthy tissue, benign&#xD;
      and malignant thyroid and breast tumors by fourier transform infrared spectrometry variables.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recently,the methods to the diagnosis of tumors include palpation,X-ray,ultrasound,CT and&#xD;
      MRI.The doctors could not get conclusion without a existing mass.The FNB is very popular&#xD;
      nowadays in western countries,but it has been reported that about one-third malignant cases&#xD;
      have been neglected by FNB,for the tissue isn't enough through the needle.There also have&#xD;
      been reports about the increased auxilliary lymphnode metastases for breast cancer because of&#xD;
      FNB.Although the Mammotome has been used widely,it is still traumatic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Process of malignant transformation of tissues and cells, first proteins, lipids,&#xD;
      carbohydrates and nucleic acids constitute the main substance of tissue and cell structure,&#xD;
      conformation, and the number of occurrence of significant changes in subsequent histological&#xD;
      changes. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy is the major molecular bond coupling between&#xD;
      the atoms vibrational spectra and molecular rotational spectra.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, consists of three phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage one:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous enrollment requires inpatient surgery 300 cases of thyroid cancer patients and&#xD;
      breast cancer patients, 200 cases of preoperative determination of tumor on the surface&#xD;
      infrared spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy of the anterior tumor tissue and lymph node&#xD;
      surgery, measured in vivo; at the same time into the group of 50 patients healthy people, the&#xD;
      determination of surface infrared spectroscopy of the thyroid and breast area. Paraffin&#xD;
      pathological findings as the gold standard, the thyroid and breast cancer patients were&#xD;
      divided into the benign group and malignant group, relatively healthy and good, the&#xD;
      distribution of differences of the surface infrared spectrum of malignant group, while&#xD;
      relatively good in the malignant group IR spectra of the distribution of differences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Were enrolled, infrared spectroscopy and pathological specimens were collected at different&#xD;
      stages. Paraffin pathological findings as the gold standard, were established two tumor&#xD;
      surface, the infrared spectra of the fresh in vitro and in vivo for tumor benign or malignant&#xD;
      diagnosis discrimination system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase III:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Into the infrared spectra collected data on behalf of the above-mentioned discrimination&#xD;
      system to verify its sensitivity, specificity and accuracy; both paraffin pathological&#xD;
      findings as the gold standard to compare the infrared spectral discrimination systems and&#xD;
      intraoperative frozen section pathology for the diagnosis of benign and malignant tumors&#xD;
      correctly rate differences, to explore the clinical value of infrared spectroscopy&#xD;
      discrimination system.&#xD;
