  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The emergence of partial artemisinin resistance in Plasmodium falciparum on the Cambodia-Thai&#xD;
      border and more recently on the Myanmar-Thai border jeopardizes the renewed global efforts of&#xD;
      control and elimination of malaria. Containment of this severe threat requires reduction of&#xD;
      transmission of the resistant phenotype by adding gametocytocidal drugs to the treatment of&#xD;
      falciparum malaria. Mathematical models also predict that transmission blocking will be&#xD;
      required if the goal of malaria elimination is to be achieved. The only drug currently&#xD;
      available with strong gametocytocidal properties against the more mature gametocytes is&#xD;
      primaquine. However, the oxidative properties of primaquine readily causes acute haemolysis&#xD;
      in glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, the degree of which appears to be&#xD;
      inversely related to G6PD enzyme activity. Because of these safety concerns, primaquine is&#xD;
      not widely deployed in treatment regimens for falciparum malaria, even in areas with&#xD;
      documented artemisinin resistance. Methylene blue, which does not exert its action through an&#xD;
      oxidative mechanism, is a promising alternative as a gametocytocidal adjuvant to artemisinin&#xD;
      combination therapies (ACTs). Paul Ehrlich discovered methylene blue as the first synthetic&#xD;
      drug ever to treat malaria. In contrast with primaquine, the thiazine dye methylene blue&#xD;
      asserts its properties as an oxidizing agent only at very high doses, whereas at&#xD;
      pharmacologic doses it has reducing agent properties and is for this reason used as a&#xD;
      medication for the treatment of methemoglobinemia. A recent laboratory study identified&#xD;
      methylene blue as a potent inhibitor of gametocyte development across all stages, almost&#xD;
      fully abolishing P. falciparum transmission to mosquitoes at concentrations readily&#xD;
      achievable in humans. In addition, a recent clinical study in 180 children with uncomplicated&#xD;
      falciparum malaria in Burkina Faso showed that, compared to artesunate-amodiaquine alone,&#xD;
      addition of the cheap drug methylene blue to either artesunate or amodiaquine importantly&#xD;
      reduced gametocyte carrier rates measured at days 3, 7, and 14 of follow-up. This effect was&#xD;
      seen both in patients with and without P. falciparum gametocytaemia at baseline. The current&#xD;
      series of studies will investigate further methylene blue as a potential gametocytocidal drug&#xD;
      in the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria.&#xD;

             include plasma donation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Subjects who have a history of allergy to the study drug or drugs of this class, or a&#xD;
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator,&#xD;
             contraindicates participation in the trial. In addition, if heparin is used during&#xD;
             pharmacokinetic sampling, subjects with a history of sensitivity to heparin or&#xD;
             heparin-induced thrombocytopenia should not be enrolled.&#xD;
