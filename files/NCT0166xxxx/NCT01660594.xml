    <textblock>
      Patients with stable chest pain presenting to general practitioners in UK are routinely&#xD;
      referred to the chest pain clinics in the hospitals. They are assessed by clinical history&#xD;
      including risk factors, cardiovascular exam, resting ECG, chest x-ray, and exercise ECG. CT&#xD;
      calcium scoring (CTCS) is a technique that is very sensitive in identifying and quantifying&#xD;
      calcified atherosclerotic plaques. Recent guidance from the National Institute of Clinical&#xD;
      Excellence (NICE, citation 1) proposes the use of CTCS in patients with stable chest pain who&#xD;
      have low likelihood of coronary artery disease (CAD). They recommend that patients with low&#xD;
      likelihood (10-30%) have a CTCS and if the score is 0, they can be considered to have&#xD;
      non-cardiac chest pain. However, there is controversy regarding relationship of absent&#xD;
      calcification with significant CAD and its prognostic value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At our institution, we have been performing CTCS in this patient cohort since 2003. We plan&#xD;
      to retrospectively review the usefulness in CTCS in patients with different likelihood for&#xD;
      significant CAD, particularly in patients with absent calcium and compare with the&#xD;
      traditional assessment. We also plan to follow-up these patients for any myocardial&#xD;
      infarction and death from any cause.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The study seeks to determine the usefulness of CT calcium scoring (CTCS) in patients&#xD;
      presenting with non-acute chest pain to the rapid access chest pain clinic (RACPC) and&#xD;
      compare it with the traditional assessment in predicting significant CAD and outcome with&#xD;
      respect to non-fatal MI or death. The clinical, diagnostic, and follow-up data of patients in&#xD;
      last 7 years since CTCS has been performed in the hospital would be retrospectively analysed&#xD;
      for the purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background Patients with chest pain (excluding that of sudden onset) are routinely referred&#xD;
      by the GPs to the RACPC centres in the hospitals. They are assessed by clinical history&#xD;
      including risk factors, cardiovascular exam, resting ECG, chest x-ray, and exercise ECG. At&#xD;
      our institution, we have also been performing CTCS in men more than 40 and women more than 50&#xD;
      years of age since 2003. Recent NICE guidance1 recommends that patients with low pre-test&#xD;
      probability (10-30%) of significant coronary artery disease (CAD) have a CT calcium scoring&#xD;
      scan and if the score is 0, they can be considered to have non-cardiac chest pain. However,&#xD;
      there is controversy regarding relationship of absent calcification with significant CAD and&#xD;
      its prognostic value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study would enable us to compare and determine the value of CTCS in patients with&#xD;
      non-acute chest pain in predicting significant CAD and safety of absent coronary artery&#xD;
      calcification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for Study&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine if CT coronary calcium scoring adds any value to the existing clinical&#xD;
           assessment and exercise ECG. This is not well established in patients presenting with&#xD;
           non-acute chest pain to the rapid access chest pain clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The study would help in determining if absence of calcification on CT can be considered&#xD;
           to have low likelihood of significant coronary artery disease and a good cardiovascular&#xD;
           outcome over the period of follow-up. Both these issues are currently controversial in&#xD;
           the literature in this group of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective To determine the prognostic value of CT coronary calcium scoring in&#xD;
      patients with non-acute chest pain for non-fatal MI and death, and compare with traditional&#xD;
      assessment including exercise ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives To determine how CT coronary calcium scoring compare with traditional&#xD;
      assessment including exercise ECG in predicting significant coronary artery disease in&#xD;
      patients presenting with non-acute chest pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY Design This is a retrospective cross-sectional study involving analysis of&#xD;
      patients' clinical, diagnostic, and management data from hospital records and follow-up&#xD;
      questionnaires for outcome. The study does not require any new diagnostic, therapeutic, or&#xD;
      interventional procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data of patients who have presented to the chest pain clinic since October 2003 would be&#xD;
      collected from hospital records for:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Age, sex, type of chest pain, and risk factors. These would be used to calculate the&#xD;
           pre-test probability of significant coronary artery disease (CAD) using Duke's score.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Results of exercise ECG where performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Results of CT calcium scoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Results of other non-invasive investigations such as stress imaging and CT coronary&#xD;
           angiography where performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Results of invasive coronary angiography where performed. Patients with &gt;70% diameter&#xD;
           stenosis or those who underwent percutaneous stent insertion (PCI) or bypass surgery&#xD;
           would be considered to have significant CAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For those patients who do not undergo any PCI or surgery as a result of above evaluation, we&#xD;
      will try to find out if they have subsequently suffered any heart attack or died. This would&#xD;
      again be performed through hospital records and if not available, through questionnaires send&#xD;
      to the patients and/or their GPs as part of standard clinical care.&#xD;
