    <textblock>
      Personal exposure to Indoor Air Pollution (IAP) is a known risk factor of severe pneumonia,&#xD;
      which is the number one killer of children under five in developing countries. The main&#xD;
      source of IAP in developing countries is cooking fires, with an estimated 3 billion people&#xD;
      still reliant on biomass stoves for their daily cooking. This study will test the&#xD;
      effectiveness of an intervention aimed to reduce IAP, as well as help to quantify the&#xD;
      relationship between exposure (IAP) and infection (pneumococcal carriage).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase I (adjunct pilot study L2010.99), 3 fuels and 5 stoves were tested to measure&#xD;
      harmful pollutant emissions. The preliminary results showed that the largest difference was&#xD;
      found in the fuels (briquettes cleaner than wood), with a smaller difference found between a&#xD;
      couple of the improved stoves and the traditional 3-stone. Re-testing of selected stove/fuel&#xD;
      combinations to confirm findings has just been completed. Phase II (this proposal) will test&#xD;
      the biomass briquettes in a randomized clinical trial to measure actual IAP reductions in&#xD;
      households. A proof of concept pneumococcal survey will also be conducted as a secondary&#xD;
      study to see whether reduced exposure to IAP affects pneumococcal carriage in babies and&#xD;
      mothers&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute respiratory infections (ARI), specifically Severe Pneumonia, are the leading cause of&#xD;
      death in children under 5 years of age. Of the nearly 10 million children under 5 who die&#xD;
      each year, 1.9 million die from ARI, almost all of which occur in developing countries [1,&#xD;
      2]. Over the years, various studies have identified many risk factors associated with ARI,&#xD;
      including malnutrition, zinc deficiency, indoor air pollution (IAP) from solid fuels and&#xD;
      tobacco. Proven efficacious interventions have been developed and studied to address risk&#xD;
      factors related to nutrition and zinc deficiency but still little is known about IAP and&#xD;
      proven effective interventions. Furthermore, little is known about the quantifiable&#xD;
      relationship between IAP exposure and disease, specifically ARI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IAP from cooking with biomass is one of the top ten global health risks [3]. 1.6 million&#xD;
      people are estimated to die every year from IAP exposure, of which half of them are children&#xD;
      under 5 years of age [4]. In developing countries, IAP is estimated to account for 3.7% of&#xD;
      the total burden of disease, making it the fourth most serious health risk factor after&#xD;
      malnutrition, STDs, and inadequate water and sanitation [5]. A recent meta-analysis found&#xD;
      that children under 5 years old living in households using biomass fuels had a 78% greater&#xD;
      chance of contracting pneumonia than did children in households with cleaner-burning fuels&#xD;
      [6]. In Africa, 94% of the rural population and 73% of the urban population use solid fuels&#xD;
      as their primary source of energy [7]. Not only does IAP disproportionally affect the poor,&#xD;
      but it also affects women and children who spend more time near the cooking fires and are&#xD;
      therefore are most exposed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of the difficulty in measuring exposure, most observational studies use proxy&#xD;
      measures. These proxies include the type of fuel used, amount of time spent near the cooking&#xD;
      fires, or whether the child is carried on the mother's back during cooking. But because&#xD;
      variations in personal exposure in most countries depend on a variety of factors (e.g. fuel,&#xD;
      stove, housing, behavioral), proxy indicators are an insufficient method to effectively&#xD;
      capture variations in exposure [8]. This affects the understanding and knowledge of the&#xD;
      potential health gains that might result from reducing exposure by varying amounts.&#xD;
      Determining this exposure-disease relationship is crucial to understanding the possible&#xD;
      impacts that interventions may have on improving health [9]. Unfortunately, the amount of&#xD;
      research being done on pollutant exposure from IAP is negligible compared to the huge disease&#xD;
      burden associated with this exposure [10]. A lot more research needs to be conducted to help&#xD;
      the lives of the 3 billion affected from these harmful pollutants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventional Research Interventional research has focused on developing more efficient&#xD;
      biomass stoves as an approach to reduce IAP, yet few studies have looked into alternative&#xD;
      biomass fuels. Though improved stoves have shown to reduce pollutant emissions in controlled&#xD;
      settings, it remains difficult to measure the true effectiveness of this intervention, i.e.&#xD;
      whether these stoves are actually reducing pollutants in local kitchens. The Water Boiling&#xD;
      Test (WBT) and Controlled Cooking Tests (CCT), both of which are conducted in controlled&#xD;
      environments, are based on the assumption that performing a simple cooking task produces&#xD;
      estimates that can be used when evaluating technology for developing populations [11].&#xD;
      However, because of the numerous behavioral and outside variables that can alter the&#xD;
      efficiency of a stove, these tests do not illustrate the true picture of how the technology&#xD;
      will perform among the population [12]. The Kitchen Performance Test (KPT) has been designed&#xD;
      to measure the effectiveness though because of its difficulties in implementation, it is&#xD;
      often not used to measure stove performance. Furthermore, there have been varying results in&#xD;
      the field effectiveness of reducing IAP with improved stoves [9]. Given the wide variability&#xD;
      in stoves and settings, it remains difficult to know what levels of IAP exposure reductions&#xD;
      can be expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of the uncertainties and challenges of reducing IAP with improved stoves, other&#xD;
      interventions to reduce pollutant levels need to be explored, such as the use of alternative&#xD;
      biomass fuel in lieu of wood. A study in 2003 in rural Kenya looked at modelling potential&#xD;
      reductions on disease following interventions including fuel, stove type and cooking&#xD;
      location. This study showed that the largest reduction was from switching fuels and not&#xD;
      stoves [3]. There are a handful of studies throughout developing countries that are currently&#xD;
      looking at using crop waste as an alternative fuel. But because crop waste varies greatly&#xD;
      with locality, separate testing needs be done on these different crop wastes and their&#xD;
      transformation into cooking fuel. In The Gambia and most of West and Central Africa,&#xD;
      groundnuts are a major cash crop and their shells are available in abundance. Recently, two&#xD;
      separate factories have been established in The Gambia to process these dried groundnut&#xD;
      shells into biomass briquettes, which will then be used as cooking fuel. During Phase I of&#xD;
      this study, the investigators have tested (and are currently retesting) the two available&#xD;
      biomass briquettes made from groundnut shells. Both the WBT and CCT are being conducted to&#xD;
      evaluate the performance of these fuels (in comparison to wood and charcoal) when used with&#xD;
      different stoves, as well as IAP emissions. These tests were conducted in accordance with the&#xD;
      protocol developed for the Shell Foundation and Household Energy Health Program [13, 14]. The&#xD;
      investigators also concurrently measured PM2.5 concentrations two ways: continuous PM2.5&#xD;
      concentrations using light-scattering, TSI 8520 DustTrak monitors and integrated PM2.5&#xD;
      concentrations using gravimetric Casella pumps, cyclones, and Teflon filters. CO&#xD;
      concentrations were also measured alongside the CCT using Drager CO 50/a-D Diffusion Tubes.&#xD;
      The Investigators preliminary analysis shows that the briquettes do burn much cleaner than&#xD;
      wood when used with each of the tested stoves. The investigators are currently retesting the&#xD;
      briquettes with the different stoves to assure the investigators have the cleanest stove/fuel&#xD;
      combination for Phase II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Phase II (this proposal), the investigators will test the effectiveness of the biomass&#xD;
      briquettes in the communities. It is possible the investigators will also use an improved&#xD;
      stove with the briquettes, though this decision will not be made until the final analysis is&#xD;
      complete in December/January. However, based on the preliminary analysis, the investigators&#xD;
      are leaning more towards briquettes with the traditional 3-stone. For simplicity sake,&#xD;
      briquettes are mentioned as the intervention throughout this document. Though RCTs usually&#xD;
      measure the efficacy of an intervention, this study is slightly different in that the&#xD;
      efficiency and efficacy have already been conducted in Phase I. This study will enable the&#xD;
      investigators to evaluate the true reduction of IAP emissions in the study population, as&#xD;
      well as the cost effectiveness of using briquettes compared to wood or charcoal. From the&#xD;
      preliminary research, the investigators found that the briquettes performed very similarly to&#xD;
      wood, and therefore do not anticipate difficulties in adopting the use of briquettes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using pneumococcal carriage as a proxy measure for a health outcome Pneumonia accounts for&#xD;
      ~30% of deaths of children under the age of 5 in developing countries, most resulting from&#xD;
      Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus). Pneumococci generally colonizes the nasopharynx&#xD;
      within the first months of life, with carriage rates in children in developing countries 2-3&#xD;
      times higher than those found in children from developed countries[15, 16]. In one study in&#xD;
      The Gambia, it was found that pneumococcal carriage was greater than 80% during the third&#xD;
      month of life [17]. In another study in Bangladesh, it was found that 50% of the children had&#xD;
      been colonized by pneumococci at least once by the age of 8 weeks [18]. Though pneumococcal&#xD;
      carriage is present in many healthy people, it is an identifiable risk for disease,&#xD;
      predominantly affecting the young in developing countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nasopharyngeal colonization is a necessary phase before infection with S pneumoniae can occur&#xD;
      [19]. Therefore, preventing colonization from ever happening can be an important measure to&#xD;
      preventing S pneumoniae. As IAP exposure is one major risk factor to developing ARI,&#xD;
      understanding how IAP exposure can affect the risk of infection for pneumococcal carriers can&#xD;
      help us better understand the quantitative relationship between IAP exposure and disease&#xD;
      (severe pneumonia). There have been previous studies looking at the impact tobacco smoke has&#xD;
      on carriage, but to date, there has yet to be any research done looking at carriage and IAP&#xD;
      exposure. This study may be instrumental in helping understand this complex exposure-disease&#xD;
      relationship. This component of the study is a Proof-of-Concept study, and is therefore&#xD;
      designed to illustrate the potential relationship between IAP exposure and ARI. If using&#xD;
      pneumococcal carriage as a proxy does show to be an effective tool in helping to quantify the&#xD;
      this relationship, it has the potential to lay the foundation for further research looking at&#xD;
      IAP and its affect on pneumococcal carriage.&#xD;
