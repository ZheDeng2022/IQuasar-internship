      According to the reports of department of Health, stroke has been the top three ranking in&#xD;
      leading ten major mortality causes. Although fatigue is a common symptom after stroke, but it&#xD;
      is easy to neglect due to fatigue is a non-specific symptom. Based on the literature review,&#xD;
      fatigue symptom is not only common on post-stroke patient and it also has highly correlation&#xD;
      with mortality, prognosis and efficacy of rehabilitation. In Traditional Chinese Medicine&#xD;
      recording, Wang Qing-ren suggests that the main etiology of stroke is results from qi&#xD;
      stagnation and blood stasis, thereafter, the study about qi deficiency and blood stasis&#xD;
      became to the main stream for stroke until now. Therefore, the purpose of the present study&#xD;
      was to investigate the correlation between the severity of fatigue, and the severity of qi&#xD;
      deficiency and blood stasis.&#xD;
