      Complying with requirements of the approval letter of clinical trial issued by SFDA (Approval&#xD;
      Letter No.: 2006L01017), Hualan conducted phase II clinical trial of Group ACYW135&#xD;
      Meningococcal Polysaccharide Vaccine to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the&#xD;
      experimental vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety end points were the presence of any systemic, local and adverse reaction.&#xD;
      Evaluation indicators of immunogenicity were bacteriocin levels of groups A, C, Y and W135&#xD;
      respectively in the serum after the whole vaccination.&#xD;
