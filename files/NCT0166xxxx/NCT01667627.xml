  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We present the study design of a clinical trial designed to assess the clinical effects of&#xD;
      the multispecies probiotic combination &quot;BIO-25&quot; in IBS-D patients. To this aim the primary&#xD;
      endpoints of the study will be improvement in abdominal pain and stool consistency. The study&#xD;
      will also be designed and powered to investigate the effect of the probiotic BIO-25 on the&#xD;
      putative inflammation-associated parameters related to microinflammation in IBS, using&#xD;
      postulated improvements in Hs-CRP, and calprotectin as markers of that effect. Additional&#xD;
      aims of the study will examine the possible effect of probiotic BIO-25 on the cholinergic&#xD;
      status.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Probiotic treatment in IBS is safe and effective. Probiotics have been shown to improve the&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory/proinflammatory ratio, and may also improve intestinal motility, and the&#xD;
      bacterial composition of the intestines. There is a substantial body of evidence in support&#xD;
      of the use of probiotics in IBS. Probiotics appear to be particularly effective in the&#xD;
      reduction of abdominal bloating and discomfort. The strains of the multispecies probiotic&#xD;
      combination (BIO-25 LR) were tested and found to be beneficial in well-designed studies of&#xD;
      IBS patients. Patients with post-infectious IBS, as well as many patients with &quot;classic&quot; IBS,&#xD;
      manifest a low-grade inflammatory state that may be associated with visceral hypersensitivity&#xD;
      and impaired motility. Probiotics may suppress this low-grade inflammation. In a recent study&#xD;
      we found that highly sensitive CRP (hs-CRP), a serum marker of micro-inflammation, was&#xD;
      significantly higher in patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS than healthy controls,&#xD;
      although within normal limits in both groups. Thus, hs-CRP may serve as a marker of this&#xD;
      low-grade, sub-clinical inflammation. If treatment with probiotic reduces the degree of&#xD;
      low-grade inflammation in IBS, the improvement may be reflected in reduced hs-CRP levels.&#xD;
      This study can contribute to our understanding of the pathophysiology of IBS and provide&#xD;
      further evidence for the effectiveness of probiotic in its treatment.&#xD;

    <description>Abdominal pain intensity, stool consistency, will be assessed by visual analogue scales (VAS) with scales from 0 (no symptom at all) to 10 (the worst possible symptom.&#xD;
The definition of treatment responders is based on the FDA Draft Guidance for Clinical Evaluation of Products for Treatment of Irritable Bowel Syndrome.&#xD;
A Pain Intensity Responder is a patient who experiences a 30% or greater decrease in the weekly average of worst abdominal pain in past 24 hours in the past 24 hours compared to baseline.&#xD;
A Stool Consistency Responder is a patient who has a greater than 50% decrease in the number of days with at least one stool ≥ type 6 using the Bristol Stool Scale (BSS).&#xD;
A patient will be classified as an overall responder if they achieve the above improvement in pain intensity and stool consistency for at least 50 percent of the time.</description>
