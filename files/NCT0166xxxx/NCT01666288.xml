    <textblock>
      Anaphylaxis is defined as a serious allergic reaction mediated by IgE that is often difficult&#xD;
      to diagnose due to the wide heterogeneity of clinical manifestations. The inciting agent is&#xD;
      often difficult to pinpoint and may include food, environmental allergens in patients&#xD;
      undergoing allergen immunotherapy, insect stings, and medications. Evidence of allergy by&#xD;
      demonstration of a positive skin test to the inciting agent, is helpful only if skin testing&#xD;
      is available. The only diagnostic modality that is useful in the diagnosis of anaphylaxis&#xD;
      when IgE skin testing is not available and the inciting agent is unknown, is an elevated&#xD;
      serum tryptase level. However, a diagnosis of anaphylaxis can be made without a tryptase&#xD;
      level or if the tryptase level is normal. A simple, non-invasive test for patients with&#xD;
      anaphylaxis is not currently available and would be helpful to diagnose and to guide further&#xD;
      management options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who develop anaphylaxis to environmental allergens or venoms during routine&#xD;
      outpatient subcutaneous allergen or venom immunotherapy are an ideal population to study as&#xD;
      we are able to evaluate these specific reactions in a controlled, clinical environment.&#xD;
      Although anaphylaxis is uncommon, the incidence has been estimated to vary between 0.01 and 4&#xD;
      percent of all allergy injections. Subcutaneous allergen or venom immunotherapies are a well&#xD;
      established form of therapy for patients with allergic rhinitis, allergic asthma, or a&#xD;
      confirmed sensitivity to stinging insects. Serial blood sampling can be performed in this&#xD;
      group of patients during a reaction and at baseline one week after a reaction, thereby&#xD;
      allowing each patient to serve as his or her own biological control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metabolomics is the study of metabolic pathways and the unique biochemical molecules which&#xD;
      result from the regulatory response to physiological stressors, disease processes, drug&#xD;
      therapy, or allergen or venom immunotherapy. By measuring changes in metabolite&#xD;
      concentrations, the range of biochemical effects and therapeutic intervention can be&#xD;
      determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator plans to use metabolic profiling of blood samples collected at the time of&#xD;
      anaphylaxis and one week after, to see if a simple, non-invasive test for patients with&#xD;
      anaphylaxis could be developed.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Males and females age 18-75 who are receiving routine outpatient subcutaneous allergen&#xD;
             and/or venom immunotherapy and who meet the World Allergy Organization (WAO) criteria&#xD;
             for anaphylaxis (below):&#xD;
&#xD;
        Has at least ONE of the following three criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Acute onset of an illness with involvement of the skin, mucosal tissue, or both (eg,&#xD;
             generalized urticaria, itching or flushing, swollen lips-tongue-uvula)&#xD;
