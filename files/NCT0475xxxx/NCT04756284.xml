      This study will sample urine provided by bladder cancer patients as part of their normal&#xD;
      routine surveillance screening. No additional effort will be required from the patients and&#xD;
      only modest additional effort from the study staff. Some de-identified patient medical&#xD;
      information may also be requested, including concominant medications, relevant current or&#xD;
      previous diseases, prior bladder cancer interventions and other relevant information to&#xD;
      ensure there are no interfering substances or other confounders that could affect study&#xD;
      results. There is no risk to patients as the normal diagnostics for bladder cancer will be&#xD;
      followed.&#xD;

        This study will sample urine provided by bladder cancer patients as part of their normal&#xD;
        routine surveillance screening. No additional effort or samples will be required from the&#xD;
        patients. Results from this study will not be used for any of the normal physician&#xD;
        diagnostic process. Patients will have a suspected bladder tumor undergoing cystoscopy or a&#xD;
        history of bladder cancer undergoing surveillance cystoscopy. Patients who have had a&#xD;
        positive diagnosis of bladder cancer, but have not yet had a tumor resection (known BCa&#xD;
        positive patients) are highly desirable for this study. It is anticipated that the majority&#xD;
        of samples collected will be negative. In the case of a known BCa positive patient, the&#xD;
        sponsor is requested&#xD;
