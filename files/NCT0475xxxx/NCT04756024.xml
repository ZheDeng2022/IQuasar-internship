  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Reference intervals (RI) of oxalate for the Pakistani population are not readily available.&#xD;
      The values used by most labs are usually taken from the literature from studies mainly&#xD;
      performed on Caucasian or from the manufacturer package insert of oxalate reagent kits [2].&#xD;
      RI of an analyte assist the clinician in differentiating between health and disease [3]. It&#xD;
      is established by testing healthy populations and figuring out what appears to be &quot;normal&quot;&#xD;
      for them after defining the reference population demographically. Careful determination and&#xD;
      verification or validation of RI by the laboratory are essential to ensure proper utility.&#xD;

      A cross-sectional study was conducted at Section of Chemical Pathology, Department of&#xD;
      Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Aga Khan University, Karachi, from June 2018 to October&#xD;
      2019 after approval from Aga Khan University Hospital's ethical review committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria included children less than six years of age, not suffering from any&#xD;
      illness during the last two weeks and no hospitalization since the last four weeks. Children&#xD;
      on vitamins or history of kidney stones or family history of kidney stones were excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A standardized questionnaire was used, and recommended target sample size was calculated&#xD;
      using CLSI Guidelines C28-A3. Non-probability (consecutive sampling) was done. Parents or&#xD;
      guardians of each reference individual were invited to participate in the study. An&#xD;
      explanation of the study, consent form (written in the local language, in accordance with the&#xD;
      guidelines of the local ethics committee), and the procedure for participation were explained&#xD;
      to the parents by the primary investigator. Those who consented were provided with a&#xD;
      container for urine collection, and the procedure for the collection was explained. A 5ml&#xD;
      random morning urine sample was collected and stored at -30 ÂºC until analysis after adding 6M&#xD;
      hydrochloric acid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urinary Oxalate was measured on Micro lab 300 using a kit based on the oxalate oxidase&#xD;
      principle by Trinity Biotech Plc, Wicklow, Ireland while creatinine was measured by kinetic&#xD;
      Jaffe reaction ADVIA 1800 by Siemens Diagnostic, USA. Samples were analyzed in batches with&#xD;
      quality control specimen for validating the results. Oxalate to creatinine ratio (Ox: Cr) was&#xD;
      calculated. College of American Pathologist, USA accredits clinical Laboratory of Aga Khan&#xD;
      University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data were analyzed by EP evaluator and SPSS 23. Subjects were categorized based on ages into&#xD;
      five groups. Group I (0-6 months), Group II (6 months-1 years), Group III (1-2 years), Group&#xD;
      IV (2-4 years), and Group V (4-6 years). Descriptive data were analyzed for frequencies and&#xD;
      median with IQR. P-value &lt;0.05 was taken as statistically significant.&#xD;
