  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is a prospective case-control study with women diagnosed early rheumatoid arthritis. Three&#xD;
      therapeutic failures were considered: failure 1 - to the first Disease-modifying&#xD;
      antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) (methotrexate); failure 2 - to the second DMARDs (leflunomide)&#xD;
      and failure 3 - to the first immunobiological drugs (adalimumab). Ultrasound was performed&#xD;
      bilaterally on the 2nd and 3rd metacarpophalangeal joints (MCFs), proximal interphalangeal&#xD;
      joints (IFPs), and wrists (US10). Ultrasound measurements (qualitative and semi-quantitative)&#xD;
      evaluated: 1 - inflammatory: synovial and tenosynovial proliferation in gray scale and power&#xD;
      Doppler (0-3); 2 - joint damage: bone erosion (qualitative and semi-quantitative) and&#xD;
      cartilage damage (qualitative and semi-quantitative). Clinical and laboratory variables were&#xD;
      also assessed blindly at baseline and after 12, 24 e 48 weeks.&#xD;

    <description>The following drug scheme was carried out: The patients began with methotrexate (MTX) 15 mg / week, which was increased to 25 mg / week until week 12. Subsequent steps for patients with an insufficient response (DAS28 score&gt; 3.2 and the Physician's Global Assessment (PGA)&gt; 4.0 [0-10 cm]) were leflunomide 20mg / day with MTX 15 mg / week from week 12 to week 24 and adalimumab twice a month and MTX 15mg / week from week 24 to week 48. The use of 5mg folic acid was advised once a week during the 48 weeks of the study. Three treatment failures were considered over these 48 weeks:&#xD;
Failure 1: failure of the first DMARD (MTX) in week 12.&#xD;
Failure 2: failure of the second DMARD (leflunomide) at week 24&#xD;
Failure 3: failure of the first immunobiological (adalimumab) at week 48.</description>
