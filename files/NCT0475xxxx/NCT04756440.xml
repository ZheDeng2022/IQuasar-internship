      This study, which is designed according to the experimental model with randomized pre-test&#xD;
      and post-test control group, will be carried out with Roman women who apply to Yavuz Selim&#xD;
      Family Health Center in Samsun province, Canik district, where Roma citizens are densely&#xD;
      registered.The population of the study consists of Roma women aged 30-65 who are registered&#xD;
      to Yavuz Selim Family Health Center in Canik district of Samsun province. The working group&#xD;
      will be composed of 80 Roma women who meet the selection criteria. The turkey in cervical&#xD;
      cancer screening taking rate is 50% and 17% to 5% error when Roman population was identified&#xD;
      as sample size 62 with power 80%.Since the study will consist of experiment and control&#xD;
      groups, each group will be determined as 31 people, and 9 backups will be taken, considering&#xD;
      that there may be losses. As a result, the research will be conducted as 40 people in the&#xD;
      experimental group and 40 people in the control group.A personal questionnaire prepared by&#xD;
      the researcher in line with the literature, Cervical Cancer and Pap Smear Test Health Belief&#xD;
      Model Scale will be applied to the Roma women who apply to Yavuz Selim Family Health Center&#xD;
      and who have accepted to participate in the study by explaining the purpose of the research&#xD;
      and those who accept to participate in the study. Roma women who are pre-tested will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to the sample pool to be divided into experimental and control groups.&#xD;
      Roman women will be divided into experimental and control groups by Simple Random Method.A&#xD;
      4-week training program will be applied to the experimental group. Afterwards, 2 weeks of&#xD;
      training will be done through music. At the end of the training, a focus group discussion&#xD;
      will be held with the participants in the experimental group regarding their educational&#xD;
      experiences, learning experiences for cervical cancer and screening and program outcomes.A&#xD;
      personal questionnaire, Cervical Cancer and Pap Smear Test Health Belief Model Scale will be&#xD;
      applied to the experimental and control groups as a final test.&#xD;

      In this study, it is aimed to present an innovative approach in ensuring the participation of&#xD;
      Roma women in cervical cancer screenings. For this purpose, music therapy and planned&#xD;
      education program will be implemented in order to influence the health beliefs of Roma&#xD;
      women.Study design ans setting The research was conducted in a randomized controlled&#xD;
      double-blind pretest-posttest controlor the control group. The randomized clinical trial was&#xD;
      based on the guidelines proposed by the Consolidated standard of Reporting Trials- CONSORT&#xD;
      2010. The data of the study will be collected in Samsun / Canik District Yavuz Selim Family&#xD;
      Health Center between January and June 2021.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A personal questionnaire prepared by the researcher in line with the literature, Cervical&#xD;
      Cancer and Pap Smear Test Health Belief Model Scale will be applied to the Roma women who&#xD;
      apply to Yavuz Selim Family Health Center and who have accepted to participate in the study&#xD;
      by explaining the purpose of the research and those who accept to participate in the study.&#xD;
      Pre-tests will be done to the experimental and control group in a training room in Yavuz&#xD;
      Selim Family Health Center. Collection of data will take approximately 15-20 minutes. Roma&#xD;
      women who are pre-tested will be randomly assigned to the sample pool to be divided into&#xD;
      experimental and control groups. Roman women will be divided into experimental and control&#xD;
      groups by Simple Random Method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection Tools Personal questionnaire; This form was developed in line with the&#xD;
      literature and consists of 18 questions to determine the introductory characteristics of the&#xD;
      participants. Personal questionnaire includes age, marital status, educational status,&#xD;
      income, employment status, social security, family history of cervical cancer, first sexual&#xD;
      intercourse age, first birth age, number of births, use of oral contraceptives, gynecological&#xD;
      problems, Training status for cervical cancer will be questioned before.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cervical Cancer and Pap Smear Test Health Belief Model Scale: This scale developed by&#xD;
      Champion for breast cancer and mammography; Adapted to Cervical Cancer and Pap Smear Test.&#xD;
      The Turkish validity and reliability study was carried out by Güvenç, Akyüz and Açıkel in&#xD;
      2010. The scale consists of 35 items and five main dimensions: sensitivity (3 items),&#xD;
      severity (7 items), Pap Smear benefit and motivation (8 items), health motivation (3 items),&#xD;
      Pap Smear barriers (14 items). 5-point Likert-type scaling ranging from 1 to 5 in the&#xD;
      evaluation of the scale - &quot;strongly disagree&quot; (1), &quot;disagree&quot; (2), &quot;undecided&quot; (3), &quot;agree&quot;&#xD;
      (4), &quot;totally agree&quot; (5) - method was used. Each dimension of the scale is evaluated&#xD;
      separately and cannot be combined into a single total score. For each individual, points are&#xD;
      obtained as much as the number of subscales. The higher the scores, the higher the&#xD;
      sensitivity, caring and motivation; It states that the perceived benefits are high for the&#xD;
      perception of benefit and the obstacles for the perception of disability are perceived high.&#xD;
      Subscales other than the perception of disability subscale are positively associated with Pap&#xD;
      Smear screening behavior. The high disability perception score of the individual indicates&#xD;
      that the barriers related to having the Pap Smear test are high.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a result of the research, the data obtained from the personal information form and the&#xD;
      cervical cancer and pap smear test health belief model scale will be evaluated in the SPSS&#xD;
      package program and will be reported. Descriptive statistics, paired t test, mc nemar test&#xD;
      and correlation analysis will be used to evaluate the data. The data recorded with a voice&#xD;
      recorder in the focus group meeting will be done by the player. Content analysis will be used&#xD;
      in the analysis of the data. Inductive analysis, that is, content analysis based on coding,&#xD;
      will be used in content analysis. In this analysis, similar data will be classified under&#xD;
      certain concepts and themes and will be interpreted in an understandable way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical aspects: Study approval was given by Ondokuz Mayıs University Clinical Research&#xD;
      Ethics Committee. (Decision No: B.30.2.ODM.0.20.08 / 616-704). All participants were informed&#xD;
