      Pneumothorax is a disease in which air in the lungs leaks into the pleural cavity. It is a&#xD;
      disease that occurs most often in young people with active social activities, and it occurs&#xD;
      in about 100,000 people in 14 cases. The recurrence rate is as high as 17% to 54%, and the&#xD;
      delay of the rehabilitation by the ambulatory with the treatment and prolongation of the&#xD;
      hospitalization becomes a problem. It becomes a large failure for the youth who requires&#xD;
      early rehabilitation. According to the latest report from the Japanese Society of Surgery,&#xD;
      approximately 12,000 pneumothorax surgeries are performed annually in Japan. Many of them&#xD;
      applied absorbent material to the surgical stump (coverage technique). However, there are no&#xD;
      prospective studies, and efficacy does not appear adequately tested. It is necessary to&#xD;
      accumulate prospective data from multiple centers to investigate the coverage technique's&#xD;
      real effect.&#xD;
