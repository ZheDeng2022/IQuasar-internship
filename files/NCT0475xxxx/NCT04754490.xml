      Study Title Exploring patterns of speech and breathing to indicate the presence of&#xD;
      obstructive respiratory disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design Prospective Case Control Study Study Participants Participants will be patients&#xD;
      attending the respiratory physiology clinic at the Cardiopulmonary Unit, Prince Charles&#xD;
      Hospital for an assessment of their lung function. In addition a cohort of control&#xD;
      participants without obstructive respiratory disease will be recruited with the assistance of&#xD;
      the British Lung Foundation charity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned Size of Sample (if applicable) We have received funding for 52 Â½ day sessions and we&#xD;
      plan to recruit on average 2 participants per session. As such we aim to recruit a minimum of&#xD;
      100 participants. In addition we are working with the British Lung Foundation to recruit a&#xD;
      smaller Cohort of control participants and aim to recruit a minimum of 25 control&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned Study Period Jan 2019 - Aug 2019 Research Aim(s) This primary objective of this novel&#xD;
      study it to create an anonymised database of speech patterns of patients with chronic&#xD;
      respiratory disease and healthy aged matched controls for comparison with lung function and&#xD;
      medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aims are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collect breathing patterns from individuals under a range of talking modalities&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Understand how easy it is to gather short speech recordings&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Explore the preferences of patients to be recorded talking&#xD;

&#xD;
        Eligibility Criteria - Control Participants Control participants will be contact through&#xD;
        the British Lung Foundations local groups who have indicated their willingness to be&#xD;
        involved in local clinical research to act as control participants. As all prospective&#xD;
        participants will have had their respiratory function measured before taking part by a&#xD;
        Respiratory Physiologist, we do not expect to have to screen for medical issues for&#xD;
        participation in the study. Furthermore, the actual tests the participants will be&#xD;
        undertaking will be non - invasive, submaximal and will require little or no effort.&#xD;
