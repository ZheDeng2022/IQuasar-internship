  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The VAP-PRO-C6 is a Russian multicenter observational program to be implemented at the&#xD;
      routine visits and assessments. The program will include patients with chronic venous disease&#xD;
      of CEAP classes C6. This program is planned to be carried out in Russia in 2021-2022.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aim of the program is to describe effectiveness and tolerability of systemic pharmacotherapy&#xD;
      as a part of combination therapy and its effect on the overall treatment outcomes in patients&#xD;
      with venous ulcers (CEAP classes C6) treated in real clinical settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The planned number of patients is 350.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion period lasts for 6 months. The treatment will be consistent with routine&#xD;
      clinical practice, local label for the medical use of drugs and the specific clinical&#xD;
      situation. The following objective methods will be used to assess the changes in the skin&#xD;
      condition:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  measurement of the area of reference ulcer (using LesionMeter*) before and after the&#xD;
           treatment;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  changes in status localis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The presence and location of venous reflux and/or occlusion. The study does not&#xD;
           implicate any intervention to routine management of patients with chronic venous disease&#xD;
           (CVD). In particular, in this study the parameters that are usually evaluated during the&#xD;
           examination of patients with classes C6 CVD (CEAP) will be recorded. Special attention&#xD;
           will be paid to evaluating changes of the area of referent VU using objective methods&#xD;
           (measuring ulcer area using LesionMeter, time to ulcer healing).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  LesionMeter is a generally available tool for measuring the venous ulcer area.&#xD;
