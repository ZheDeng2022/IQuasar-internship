  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Erectore Spinae Plane Block (ESP Block) is a recently described technique for regional&#xD;
      anesthesia that has shown promising results in the treatment of pain after thoracic surgery.&#xD;
      It involves the injection of local anesthetic behind the musculature of the back.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We intend to compare this technique with a more standardized one, the TAP Block, which&#xD;
      involves injection of anesthetic behind the musculature of the abdomen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      50 patients undergoing robotic inguinal hernia repair under general anesthesia will be&#xD;
      randomly selected to receive, in addition to general anesthesia, either the ESP block or the&#xD;
      TAP block. Patients receiving an ESP Block will also receive an injection of saline solution&#xD;
      in the TAP injection site, and the other way around. This will prevent preconceived ideas on&#xD;
      either technique to influence the evaluationso of the effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain scores and consumption of pain medication will be recorded during the 24 hours following&#xD;
      the operation to compare the effect of the two techniques.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the recent era of increased awareness towards the risks and complications of opioid&#xD;
      treatment, pain management after common surgical interventions by the means of regional&#xD;
      anesthesia is of renewed interest for both clinical and logistic reasons, as it is known that&#xD;
      good pain management reduces complications and cost associated to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regional and local anesthetic techniques after inguinal hernia surgery have been the topic of&#xD;
      multiple studies, comparing various infiltrative methods, including wound infiltration, port&#xD;
      site infiltration, iliohypogastric and ilioinguinal nerve block, paravertebral and&#xD;
      transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block and epidural analgesia. Most methods investigate pain&#xD;
      treatment in the setting of open surgery. The progressive evolution towards laparoscopic and&#xD;
      robot-assisted methods changes the mechanisms of surgical pain and, with it, the rational for&#xD;
      the choice of the analgesic technique adopted. The transversus abdominis plane (TAP) has&#xD;
      become a widely used technique and has been demonstrated to be associated to a mild opioid&#xD;
      sparing effect, but with inconsistent results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The erector spinae plane block is a promising technique, recently described and used&#xD;
      especially in thoracic surgery. Multiple case reports and studies in pediatrics report it to&#xD;
      be a safe and effective method for abdominal surgery as well, but no prospective randomized&#xD;
      trials were published to date in the adult population, particularly with regard to&#xD;
      laparoscopic or robotic hernia repair. A prospective comparison between the two techniques is&#xD;
      therefore needed in this specific context.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis and primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize the superiority of the ESP-block to the TAP-block with respect to&#xD;
      post-operative pain control after abdominal surgery, leading to a reduction in reserve&#xD;
      analgesic consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our objective is to compare the clinical outcomes and safety of ESP block versus TAP block in&#xD;
      patients undergoing robot-assisted TAPP inguinal hernia repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary and secondary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The highest VAS score reported between end of sedation and 6 hours after surgery or&#xD;
           discharge of the patient, whichever comes first Secondary Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time to first rescue analgesic&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total dose of rescue opioids (morphine equiavalents) in the first 24 hours after surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time of first walk after surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Need for anti-nausea medication (dosage, doses and time points)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Episodes of vomiting&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Episodes of urinary retention&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient's satisfaction (measured on the validated LPPS questionnaire for the&#xD;
           perioperative patients' satisfaction )&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Length of hospital stay&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design This is a single center, prospective, randomized, placebo-blinded, controlled&#xD;
      superiority trial in 2 parallel arms comparing the efficacy and safety of the ESP Block and&#xD;
      the TAP block on patients undergoing elective robot-assisted inguinal hernia repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up will consist in the hospitalization period plus one telephone consultation at 24&#xD;
      hours after hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods of minimizing bias:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation - Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio by a computer generated random&#xD;
      number sequence through the RedCap software system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the randomization arm patients will receive:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  sham US-guided ESP block + US-guided TAP block before laparoscopic hernia repair&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  US-guided ESP block + sham US-guided TAP block before laparoscopic hernia repair&#xD;
           Allocation will take place immediately before the intervention by the means of access to&#xD;
           centralized, real-time allocation through a computer program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Personnel not directly involved with patient care will prepare a saline solution and a&#xD;
      ropivacaine solution which will be allocated respectively to ESP or TAP block according to&#xD;
      randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will allow blinding of patients, care providers and data collectors. Analysis will be&#xD;
      done on allocation-concealed data, permitting blinded analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unbliding will be permitted if by doing so harm to one or more patients can be avoided or&#xD;
      treated. After information of one of the principal investigators, specific patient allocation&#xD;
      will be retrieved from the randomization program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other methods of minimising bias&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain scores will be measured at 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 hours after extubation and at the time of&#xD;
      administration of reserve analgesics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The administration of reserve analgesics will follow a standardized internal protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires validated to assess functional results after hernia surgery will be used for&#xD;
      this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  pain: Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  surgical complications classification: Clavien Dindo's classification&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  comorbidities : American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) score&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  validated LPPS questionnaire for the perioperative patients' satisfaction [21]&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EHS inguinal hernia classification&#xD;
