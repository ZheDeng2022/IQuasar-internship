  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare vaginal and oral misoprostol, to determine whether a vaginal&#xD;
      misoprostol regimen achieves a higher vaginal delivery rate in a real-world, high-volume&#xD;
      setting, and whether this regimen reduces time and oxytocin need on a high-volume Labor and&#xD;
      Delivery unit at Parkland Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our primary hypothesis is that among women with singleton, term pregnancies, cervical&#xD;
      dilation 2cm or less, and indicated labor induction, the rate of vaginal delivery is&#xD;
      significantly increased when a standardized vaginal misoprostol regimen is used, compared&#xD;
      with a standardized oral misoprostol regimen.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the use of a standardized vaginal&#xD;
      misoprostol regimen will result in a decreased primary cesarean delivery rate among women&#xD;
      with a cervical dilation of 2 centimeters of less who require induction of labor at term,&#xD;
      compared with the currently used oral misoprostol regimen. We also aim to evaluate oxytocin&#xD;
      use, time to delivery, uterine activity, indication for cesarean delivery, intrapartum and&#xD;
      postpartum infectious morbidities, excess blood loss at delivery, and adverse neonatal&#xD;
      outcomes in the overall population as well as nulliparous women specifically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a prospective, cluster-randomized clinical trial to compare the rate of vaginal&#xD;
      delivery achieved when two standards of care are used across a large population of women with&#xD;
      indication for labor induction at Parkland Hospital. Eligible participants will include&#xD;
      nulliparous and multiparous women at 37 weeks gestation or greater, with a living, singleton&#xD;
      fetus and no major fetal malformations, in cephalic presentation, with intact membranes, no&#xD;
      prior uterine scar, who qualify for prostaglandin administration and who have a cervical&#xD;
      dilation of 2 centimeters or less, measured at the level of the internal os. Patients with&#xD;
      non-reassuring fetal status, active herpes outbreak, a prior uterine scar, or any&#xD;
      contraindication to prostaglandins (including 4 or more painful contractions per 10 minutes&#xD;
      prior to prostaglandin administration) will be excluded from participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Computer-generated cluster randomization will occur on a weekly basis for all study&#xD;
      participants, to either the vaginal misoprostol regimen (study group) or to oral misoprostol&#xD;
      regimen (control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the randomization protocol each week, participants will be randomized to either&#xD;
      the oral misoprostol standard of care (control group) or vaginal misoprostol standard of care&#xD;
      (study group). The study group will receive vaginal misoprostol 25 mcg every 3 hours for a&#xD;
      maximum of 5 doses in those who meet criteria for prostaglandin administration. The control&#xD;
      group will receive oral misoprostol 100 micrograms given every 4 hours for a maximum of 2&#xD;
      doses. Misoprostol will not be administered to patients who have progressed to active labor,&#xD;
      defined as 4 centimeters cervical dilation. Intravenous oxytocin will be administered&#xD;
      according to current PHHS protocol for both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No direct contact between the research team and patients will be required, as this is a&#xD;
      systematic comparison of two standards of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be the rate of vaginal delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes will include maternal and neonatal outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maternal outcomes will include time to delivery, time (hours) of oxytocin, need for oxytocin,&#xD;
      indication for cesarean delivery, labor analgesia, clinical chorioamnionitis, tachysystole,&#xD;
      hyperstimulation syndrome, excess estimated blood loss, transfusion at delivery,&#xD;
      endometritis, surgical site infection, uterine rupture, and unplanned hysterectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neonatal outcomes will include meconium-stained amniotic fluid, umbilical cord pH &lt;7.0,&#xD;
      5-minute Apgar &lt;4, neonatal intubation or ventilation in the delivery room, neonatal sepsis,&#xD;
      and neonatal intensive care (NICU) admission.&#xD;
