      This phase II trial studies the effect of selinexor when combined with carfilzomib,&#xD;
      daratumumab, and dexamethasone in treating patients with high-risk multiple myeloma that has&#xD;
      come back (recurrent) or has not responded to treatment (refractory) and who have received&#xD;
      1-3 prior lines of therapy. Selinexor may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking a&#xD;
      protein called CRM1 that is needed for cell growth. Carfilzomib is a type of drug called a&#xD;
      proteasome inhibitor. A proteasome is a protein found within cells that has the important&#xD;
      role of identifying and marking damaged proteins that are needed to be destroyed by the cell&#xD;
      for survival. The inhibition of the proteasome allows for damaged protein to accumulate&#xD;
      within cells. This accumulation of damaged protein causes the cell to die. Daratumumab is a&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody that may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread.&#xD;
      Anti-inflammatory drugs, such as dexamethasone lower the body's immune response and are used&#xD;
      with other drugs in the treatment of some types of cancer. Giving selinexor in combination&#xD;
      with carfilzomib, daratumumab, and dexamethasone may work better than carfilzomib,&#xD;
      daratumumab, and dexamethasone alone in treating patients with multiple myeloma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity rate, at 10^-5 level of&#xD;
      sensitivity by flow cytometry in bone marrow, with the addition of selinexor to daratumumab,&#xD;
      carfilzomib and dexamethasone (SKDd) in patients with high-risk, relapsed or&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the overall response rate (partial response [PR] or better) of patients&#xD;
      receiving SDKd combination for high risk, relapsed or relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma&#xD;
      (MM) and assess depth of response (very good partial response [VGPR], complete response [CR],&#xD;
      stringent complete response [sCR]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the time to response and duration of response in patients receiving SDKd&#xD;
      combination for MM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the progression free survival and overall survival in patient receiving&#xD;
      SDKd.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate the MRD negativity rates to the level of sensitivity 10^-6 by flow cytometry&#xD;
      in bone marrow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To evaluate the safety profile of the SDKd combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CORRELATIVE RESEARCH OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To explore the impact of baseline immunomodulatory derivative (IMiD)-14 scores gene&#xD;
      expression profile (GEP) on progression free survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Quality of life assessment utilizing Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ)-Core (C) 30 and&#xD;
      QLQ-Multiple Myeloma (MY) 20 (Cocks et al., 2007; Wisloff et al., 1996).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive carfilzomib intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 and&#xD;
      daratumumab IV as a split dose on cycle 1 days 1 and 2 then on days 8, 15, and 22 of cycle 1,&#xD;
      then on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of cycle 2, days 1 and 15 of cycles 3-6, and day 1 of&#xD;
      subsequent cycles. Patients also receive dexamethasone orally (PO) on days 1, 8 15, and 22,&#xD;
      and selinexor PO on days 1, 8, and 15. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients without disease progression/clinical relapse or&#xD;
      have initiated subsequent anti-cancer therapy, are followed up every 3 months until&#xD;
      progression/clinical relapse or initiation of subsequent anti-cancer therapy, and then every&#xD;
      6 months for up to 5 years. Patients with disease progression/clinical relapse or have&#xD;
      initiated subsequent anti-cancer therapy are followed up every 6 months for up to 5 years.&#xD;

    <description>MRD negative status at 10^-5 level of sensitivity by flow cytometry will be considered synonymous with &quot;success&quot;, unless specified otherwise.
