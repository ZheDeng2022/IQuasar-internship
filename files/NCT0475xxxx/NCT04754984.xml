  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After having a baby, there are some expected changes in pelvic floor function. However,&#xD;
      tearing of the pelvic floor, having a large baby and needing a vacuum or forceps to deliver&#xD;
      the baby put women at risk for having pelvic floor disorders. Our study aims to see if, in&#xD;
      women who had a high risk for pelvic floor disorders, a pelvic floor education workshop four&#xD;
      weeks after delivery can improve pelvic floor disorders compared to those that did not have a&#xD;
      workshop.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is compelling evidence for the need for perineal education and care, especially in&#xD;
      women who have recognized risk factors. For example, 30-50% of women who have a clinically&#xD;
      recognized risk factor report anal incontinence, fecal urgency, dyspareunia and perineal&#xD;
      pain. Despite this, a study found that less than 50% of women with anal incontinence voice&#xD;
      those symptoms unless directly asked about them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some authors discuss how women may not share these symptoms with their care providers out of&#xD;
      the belief that it is a &quot;normal&quot; effect of childbirth. A review of the literature shows that&#xD;
      antenatal educational workshops can be an effective means to provide pregnant women with&#xD;
      information regarding pelvic floor health, including how modes of delivery impact pelvic&#xD;
      floor function. Similarly, antenatal pelvic floor workshops have been found to improve&#xD;
      patients' knowledge on pelvic floor health, their practice of pelvic floor muscle exercises&#xD;
      and their confidence with these exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To our knowledge, there is no literature exploring the role of a postpartum pelvic floor&#xD;
      workshop, on managing perineal and pelvic floor symptoms in women who are identified as being&#xD;
      at higher risk of developing pelvic floor dysfunction. Our goal is to develop and assess such&#xD;
      a workshop.&#xD;
