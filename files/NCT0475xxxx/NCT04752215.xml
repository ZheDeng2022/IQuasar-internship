  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is open to adults with advanced solid tumors whose previous cancer treatment was&#xD;
      not successful. People can participate if their tumor has the B7-H6 marker or if they have&#xD;
      colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study tests 2 medicines called BI 765049 and BI 754091. Both medicines may help the&#xD;
      immune system fight cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to find out the highest dose of BI 765049 alone and in&#xD;
      combination with BI 754091 the participants can tolerate. In this study, BI 765049 is given&#xD;
      to people for the first time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants can stay in the study for up to 3 years, if they benefit from treatment and can&#xD;
      tolerate it. During this time, they get BI 765049 alone or in combination with BI 754091 as&#xD;
      infusion into a vein every 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The doctors check the health of the participants and note any health problems that could have&#xD;
      been caused by BI 765049 or BI 754091. The doctors also regularly monitor the size of the&#xD;
      tumor.&#xD;
