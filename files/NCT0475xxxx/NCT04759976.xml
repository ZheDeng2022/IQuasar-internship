  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to develop and evaluate novel robotic training strategies that&#xD;
      modulate errors based on the subjects' individual motor and cognitive needs. For this&#xD;
      purpose, healthy adults and neurologic patients will participate in robotic motor learning&#xD;
      experiments. Patients have a diagnosis of a neurological disease (i.e., stroke, spinal cord&#xD;
      injury, multiple sclerosis, Guillain-Barré syndrome) limiting arm motor function.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neurological patients (e.g., after stroke) engage in intensive and expensive&#xD;
      neurorehabilitation therapy to regain part of their former motor functional ability to&#xD;
      perform everyday activities with often limited and unsatisfactory outcome. Robots became a&#xD;
      promising supplement or even alternative for neurorehabilitation therapy, providing&#xD;
      cost-effective, high repetition and task-oriented training. However, results of an initial&#xD;
      body of work comparing the effectiveness of robotic training strategies are highly&#xD;
      inconclusive. A possible explanation is that most current robotic systems cover only one&#xD;
      neurorehabilitation strategy (e.g. reducing or augmenting movement errors) and may thus&#xD;
      insufficiently address the subjects' individual needs and the characteristics of the task to&#xD;
      be learned. In this study, Investigators will perform several motor learning experiments with&#xD;
      healthy adult and neurological patients in order to evaluate the relative motor and cognitive&#xD;
      benefits of newly developed robotic training strategies that modulate errors based on the&#xD;
      subject's age, skill level and tasks characteristics. The effects of the new strategies will&#xD;
      be compared to classical robotic assistance, and to non-robotic feedback approaches, such as&#xD;
      visual feedback. The culmination of this work may help to optimize training benefits of&#xD;
      already existing rehabilitation robots.&#xD;
