  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm prospective clinical trial to determine the safety and feasibility of&#xD;
      using transdermal buprenorphine in alleviation of radiation induced mucositis pain in head&#xD;
      and neck cancer patients.&#xD;

      Hypothesis: Long-acting transdermal buprenorphine (FDA-approved dose from 5 mcg to 20 mcg&#xD;
      /week) in conjunction with oral tramadol (50mg-400mg) as needed for breakthrough pain would&#xD;
      lead to significant reduction in mucositis-related pain in locally advanced head and neck&#xD;
      cancer patients being treated with radiation therapy by the end of treatment and follow up&#xD;
      period of 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single-arm, interventional, supportive care clinical trial for head and neck cancer&#xD;
      patients evaluating role of transdermal (TD) buprenorphine and tramadol combination in&#xD;
      alleviating radiation-induced mucositis pain. This will generate preliminary data to test the&#xD;
      feasibility and efficacy of study drug regimen. The study will also test the clinical&#xD;
      usefulness of the smart phone pain app in recording and reporting radiation induced mucositis&#xD;
      pain.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 9.</time_frame>
    <description>The Brief Pain Inventory - Short Form (BPI-sf) is a nine-item self-administered questionnaire used to evaluate the severity of a patient's pain and the impact of this pain on the patient's daily functioning. The patient is asked to rate their worst, least, average, and current pain intensity -- 0 being no pain and 10 being the pain as bad as you can imagine (within the previous 24 hours).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The number of subjects who achieve at least a 30 percent decrease in pain from baseline in average daily pain score calculated by OM pain app.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 9.</time_frame>
    <description>The Oral Mucositis (OM) Pain App is a smartphone application that was designed to permit subjects to key in pain severity using a visual analog 0-10 scale. The amount of pain that a subject feels ranges across a continuum from none (0) to an extreme amount of pain (10). The App is programed with an alarm to prompt the patient to record pain severity at prescribed intervals daily and through spontaneous patient input. Compliance is measured by subjects entering in a value four times a day into the OM Pain App.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients aged 18-80 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Histologically confirmed malignancies involving the oral cavity, oropharynx,&#xD;
             hypopharynx and larynx (including non-squamous cell histologies, salivary gland&#xD;
             carcinomas and unknown primary tumors).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Undergoing a course of either definitive radiation (dose of at least 50 Gy to the head&#xD;
             and neck region) +/-chemotherapy or adjuvant radiation (at least 50 Gy to the head and&#xD;
             neck region) +/- chemotherapy (Patients with a history of prior definitive course of&#xD;
             radiation will be allowed).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance status â‰¤ 2&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Concurrent enrollment on interventional trial is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. English speaking and literate&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients will be allowed to take radiotherapy mix, viscous lidocaine or magic&#xD;
             mouthwash like agents that do not contain opioids. Tylenol allowed for fever and mild&#xD;
             pain before starting drug regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Adequate organ function: Minor dose adjustments for tramadol is required in severe&#xD;
             liver and renal impairment so we would only include patients with adequate organ&#xD;
             function outlined in below. No dose adjustment for renal or hepatic impairment is&#xD;
             required for TD buprenorphine. Some other parameters like hemoglobin, platelets and&#xD;
             white blood count (WBC) are required for administration of standard of care&#xD;
             chemotherapy like cisplatin along with radiation in treatment of head and neck&#xD;
             squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). They are not required for administration of&#xD;
             buprenorphine or tramadol.&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. total bilirubin &lt; 2 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. aspartate aminotransferase (AST) / alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &lt; 5 times&#xD;
                  institutional upper limit&#xD;

               3. creatinine clearance &gt; 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with creatinine levels&#xD;
                  above institutional normal&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Pregnancy: It is known that standard of care treatments of HNSCC radiation therapy and&#xD;
             chemotherapy have detrimental effects on human pregnancy or development of the embryo&#xD;
             or fetus. Therefore, female patients participating in this study should avoid becoming&#xD;
             pregnant, and male patients should avoid impregnating a female partner. Non-sterilized&#xD;
             female patients of reproductive age and male patients should use effective methods of&#xD;
             contraception through defined periods during and after study treatment as specified&#xD;
             below.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Female patients must meet one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Postmenopausal for at least one year before the screening visit, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Surgically sterile, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If they are of childbearing potential, agree to practice two effective methods of&#xD;
                  contraception from the time of signing of the informed consent form through three&#xD;
                  months after the last dose of study drug, AND&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Must also adhere to the guidelines of any treatment-specific pregnancy prevention&#xD;
                  program, if applicable, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Agree to practice true abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and&#xD;
                  usual lifestyle of the subject. (Periodic abstinence [e.g., calendar, ovulation,&#xD;
                  symptothermal, post ovulation methods] and withdrawal are not acceptable&#xD;
                  contraception methods.)&#xD;
&#xD;
             Male patients, even if surgically sterilized (i.e., status post vasectomy), must agree&#xD;
             to one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Practice effective barrier contraception during the entire study treatment period&#xD;
                  and through 90 days after the last study drug dose, OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Must also adhere to the guidelines of any treatment-specific pregnancy prevention&#xD;
                  program, if applicable, OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Agree to practice true abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and&#xD;
                  usual lifestyle of the subject. (Periodic abstinence [e.g., calendar, ovulation,&#xD;
                  symptothermal, post ovulation methods] and withdrawal are not acceptable methods&#xD;
                  of contraception.)&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Ability to understand a written informed consent document, and the willingness to sign&#xD;
             it.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Possession of a smart phone (android or apple-based platforms) and ability to operate&#xD;
             a smart phone application. Patients who do not have smart phones will be provide&#xD;
             wireless devices that have OM pain app installed on them.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Physical exam demonstrating preexisting mucositis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Preexisting oral infection or ongoing toxicity from prior radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. History of substance abuse, positive urine drug screen in last six months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients with multiple distant metastasis (subjects with resectable oligometastasis&#xD;
             will be allowed)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Current or recent use (within four weeks of screening) of mixed opioid&#xD;
             agonists/antagonists or other opioid antagonists. Methadone use within four weeks of&#xD;
             screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. History of prolonged QTc&gt;greater than 450 milliseconds in males and greater than 470&#xD;
             milliseconds in females.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients on systemic therapy (chemotherapy or immunotherapy) for another cancer&#xD;
             subtype.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients receiving induction chemotherapy prior to or after radiation/chemoradiation&#xD;
             like patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients with history of abdominal surgery within 60 days of registration, acute&#xD;
             gastrointestinal conditions like colitis and appendicitis within four weeks of&#xD;
             screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patients with conditions that may compromise blood-brain barrier permeability. The&#xD;
             blood-brain barrier may become leaky in select neurological diseases, such as&#xD;
             amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, epilepsy, brain trauma and edema&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Patients with a history of myocardial infarction â‰¤ 6 months prior to registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Patients with h/o significant respiratory depression; acute or severe bronchial&#xD;
             asthma; known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. History of serious or severe hypersensitivity reaction to buprenorphine or tramadol or&#xD;
             any of its excipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Patients on anti-depressant and anti-psychotic therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Pregnant and lactating women are excluded from this study because chemotherapy and&#xD;
             radiation given for treatment of HNSCC has a potential for teratogenic or&#xD;
             abortifacient effects. Additionally, Buprenorphine is classified as category C for use&#xD;
             during pregnancy, which means that the risk of adverse effects on the fetus cannot be&#xD;
             ruled out. Buprenorphine does cross the placenta, and the use of opioids during&#xD;
             pregnancy may result in neonatal withdrawals soon after birth. Symptoms of this may&#xD;
             include irritability, apnea, increased tone, tremor, convulsions, or respiratory&#xD;
             depression in the neonate. The onset of withdrawal in a neonate whose mother has taken&#xD;
             buprenorphine during the pregnancy could be anywhere from the first day of life to the&#xD;
             eighth day of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Patients with history of seizure disorder as oral tramadol may reduce seizure&#xD;
             threshold.&#xD;
