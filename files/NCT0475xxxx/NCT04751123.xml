    <textblock>
      ntroduction: Pressure sores and postural changes are observed in wheelchair users due to long&#xD;
      sitting. Depending on this situation, the quality of life and activity participation level of&#xD;
      these individuals decrease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: This study will be conducted between March 1 and June 30, 2021 in Necmettin Erbakan&#xD;
      University, Meram Faculty of Medicine, Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation Polyclinic. With&#xD;
      the hamstring and trunk flexibility sit-lie test, six sensors placed on the sitting pressure&#xD;
      sitting cushion, daily life activity FIM, skill assessment tests will be applied for manual&#xD;
      and wheelchair users. Wheelchair Satisfaction CHART and quality of life World Health&#xD;
      Organization Quality of Life (Whool ) will be evaluated with.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Application: Patients coming to the center spend 20 minutes on MAT. After resting, FIM will&#xD;
      be evaluated with the sit-and-lie test. Afterwards, the patient will be put in a wheelchair.&#xD;
      The initial sitting pressure will be taken as soon as you sit in the wheelchair. And at that&#xD;
      time, CHART and WHOOL will be completed by asking the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion: In the light of these evaluations, the change in initial sitting pressure and&#xD;
      posture over time will be examined.&#xD;

      HH.3. Scope:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Which is about 12.29% of the population consists of disabled people in Turkey and the highest&#xD;
      rate of disability It is known that physical disability (1). Having at least one wheelchair&#xD;
      of approximately 75 million worldwide according to 2019 data plays a critical role in&#xD;
      improving mobility (2). In fact, the wheelchair is one of the most widely used assistive&#xD;
      technology tools to increase personal mobility and is a precondition for those with limited&#xD;
      mobility to enjoy their human rights, live in dignity and become more productive members in&#xD;
      their community. For many people, a well-designed and well-equipped wheelchair can be the&#xD;
      right step for social inclusion (3). More than half of wheelchair users need assistance with&#xD;
      using their wheelchairs and daily living activities (4). The literature investigating the&#xD;
      factors affecting wheelchair use mainly consists of variables related to the environment and&#xD;
      physical characteristics of wheelchair users (4). Correct selection and configuration of&#xD;
      wheelchairs can increase mobility, effectiveness and participation (5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      While sitting comfort is associated with softness and support, lack of support, unbalanced&#xD;
      pressure distribution, biomechanics and fatigue factors are associated with sitting&#xD;
      discomfort. Anatomical factors can cause characteristic tissue loads that appear to be&#xD;
      associated with tissue damage, discomfort, or axillary posture or movement modifications.&#xD;
      Following excessive or prolonged tissue loading, cell death may lead to the development of&#xD;
      superficial or deep compression wounds (6). A superficial pressure sore first affects the&#xD;
      skin layers near the epidermal tissue and is typically associated with damaging friction and&#xD;
      shear forces with the presence of moisture and heat (7). Deep compression sores typically&#xD;
      begin with the deformation of deep muscle and fat tissues beneath the ischial tuberocytes in&#xD;
      the sitting position (8). Although the etiology of pressure sores is multifactorial (9),&#xD;
      continuous pressure at the user seat interface is considered the most important factor&#xD;
      (10,11). Therefore, wheelchair features are very important for posture and pressure sores. In&#xD;
      our study, wheelchair features will be examined and these features will be compared with&#xD;
      patient satisfaction. In addition, wheelchair characteristics and patient satisfaction in&#xD;
      different patient groups (such as spinal cord injury, Multiple Sclerosis, Cerebrovascular&#xD;
      Incident (stroke)) will also be discussed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses Ho: There is no difference between initial sitting pressure and posture in&#xD;
      wheelchair users and sitting pressure and posture after 2 and 3 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1: There is a difference between the initial sitting pressure and posture in wheelchair&#xD;
      users and the sitting pressure and posture after 2 and 3 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H2: There is a difference between the initial sitting pressure and posture and the sitting&#xD;
      pressure and posture after 2 and 3 hours in different patient groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H.4. Method: Individuals Patients who are being followed up in FTR or neurology Neurology&#xD;
      clinics at Necmettin Erbakan University Meram Faculty of Medicine will be included in the&#xD;
      study. In the G-Power analysis we conducted, Cascioli's study was based on comfort (12).&#xD;
      However, we think that the number of people to be included in the study is low in terms of&#xD;
      objectivity of the data. For this reason, a preliminary study will be conducted during the&#xD;
      study and the sample number will be confirmed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Physical characteristics and history taking: Patients will be asked in detail about age,&#xD;
           height, weight, disease diagnosis and duration, and wheelchair characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Inclusion criteria were:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Patients with multiple sclerosis, myopathies, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, polio&#xD;
                and medulla spinalis incision,&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Being 18 years of age or older,&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. have used a wheelchair for at least three months,&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. being dependent on a wheelchair (all day) or at certain times of the day as the&#xD;
                primary means of movement, Individuals will be excluded if they have suffered&#xD;
                pressure sores within the last year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluations After taking the patient's history, the person was taken to MAT bed for 20&#xD;
           minutes. will be provided to rest. 20 minutes At the end, the patient who passes to the&#xD;
           wheelchair will be asked to evaluate the comfort and discomfort they perceived after the&#xD;
           first contact in the chair as 0 (none) -10 (very bad). Grading will be asked to evaluate&#xD;
           the discomfort in the head, neck, back, waist, hips and legs, not the general sense of&#xD;
           comfort. Meanwhile, pressure and posture will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Route-Reach test: This test is used to evaluate hamstring and trunk flexion&#xD;
                flexibility. The subject will be asked to sit on the test table with both knees in&#xD;
                extension on a firm surface and reach out with his hands and feet without bending&#xD;
                the knees. The distance between the fingers and the tip of the test table is&#xD;
                measured with a ruler&#xD;
