    <textblock>
      An open-label, multicenter, single-dose, single-period, sequential study with the primary&#xD;
      objective of assessing the effect of moderate renal impairment on the PK of surufatinib&#xD;
      following administration of 300mg single oral dose. The secondary objective is to evaluate&#xD;
      the safety in subjects with moderate renal impairment and subjects with normal renal function&#xD;
      following a single oral dose of 300mg surufatinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 16 subjects will be enrolled&#xD;
