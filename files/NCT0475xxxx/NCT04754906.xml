  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Falling is an event that is more frequent and severe in older age. It can lead to a loss of&#xD;
      autonomy and a decrease in quality of life. It is therefore important to understand this&#xD;
      phenomenon in order to better prevent it. Among the multiple risk factors associated with&#xD;
      falling, recent research has shown a link between the decline in cognitive abilities (i.e.,&#xD;
      the mental processes that form our knowledge, such as memory) and the risk of falling.&#xD;
      However, the impact of this cognitive decline on motor skills is still poorly understood. The&#xD;
      purpose of this research is to study how the changes induced by aging affect motor skills.&#xD;
      This would make it possible to take a new look at the phenomenon of falls occurring in the&#xD;
      elderly and, in the long term, to improve the prevention and rehabilitation.&#xD;
