      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dentine hypersensitivity (DH) causes considerable pain and discomfort to an individual due to&#xD;
      number of stimuli on exposed dentine. Different kinds of treatment strategies are used in the&#xD;
      resolution of dentine hypersensitivity including the use of propolis and dentine bonding&#xD;
      agent. No study had compared the efficacy of propolis and dentine bonding agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study was to find out whether there is a difference in the efficacy of&#xD;
      Propolis and seventh generation dentine bonding agent in reducing the dentine&#xD;
      hypersensitivity. Comparison within the groups and pairwise comparisons were also recorded in&#xD;
      reducing dentine hypersensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this six month In- Vivo single blinded randomized clinical study, a total number of 52&#xD;
      patients with complain of dentine hypersensitivity were selected in two groups after taking&#xD;
      informed consent. Group A and B received 30% ethanolic extract of propolis and dentine&#xD;
      bonding agents respectively by a trained operator. Recordings of dentine hypersensitivity&#xD;
      were obtained at Day 0, before and after the application of experimental agents, and also on&#xD;
      Day 7, 15 and 30 by the principal investigator. Response was measured by Visual Analog Scale&#xD;
      and Schiff Cold Air Sensitivity Scale. Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS)&#xD;
      version 20 was used to analyze the data with level of significance set at p &lt; 0.05. Friedman&#xD;
      test was applied to see the comparison within groups and Wilcoxon Signed Rank test was used&#xD;
      for Pairwise comparison. Mann Whitney U-Test was applied for comparison between groups.&#xD;

    <description>Treatment of dentine hypersensitivity assessed with the help of Schiff Cold Air Sensitivity Scale. Recordings were obtained at Day 0, before the application of experimental agents.&#xD;
Schiff Cold Air Sensitivity Scale is mainly used to evaluate subject response to a stimulus like air or evaporative. This scale is scored as follows:&#xD;
Subject does not respond to air stimulus.&#xD;
Subject responds to air stimulus but does not request discontinuation of stimulus.&#xD;
Subject responds to air stimulus and requests discontinuation or moves from stimulus.&#xD;
Subject responds to air stimulus, considers stimulus to be painful, and requests discontinuation of the stimulus</description>
