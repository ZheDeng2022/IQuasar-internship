  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of cardiac radioablation&#xD;
      (CRA) as a means of noninvasive treatment of ventricular tachycardia (VT) refractory to both&#xD;
      medication and catheter ablation.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ventricular tachycardia (VT) is a regular, rapid (faster than 100 beats per minute) abnormal&#xD;
      heart rhythm resulting from aberrant electrical conduction in the ventricles of the heart.&#xD;
      Coronary heart disease is responsible for the majority of VT cases. Defibrillation and&#xD;
      antitachycardia pacing, effective means of terminating a life-threatening acute episode of&#xD;
      VT, can be delivered via implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). ICDs are able to both&#xD;
      monitor the heart rhythm continuously and deliver therapy in response to tachycardia that&#xD;
      meets pre-programmed detection criteria. For patients with VT refractory to medical&#xD;
      management requiring multiple ICD shocks, electrophysiologic mapping may be utilized to&#xD;
      localize the arrhythmogenic focus, which can be subsequently ablated with cardiac catheter&#xD;
      radiofrequency ablation. The goal of catheter ablation is to identify (through&#xD;
      electroanatomical mapping) and then eliminate the channels of surviving myocardium within the&#xD;
      substrate. Many patients experience continued episodes of VT refractory to both medication&#xD;
      and multiple catheter ablation attempts. ICD shocks are associated with substantially&#xD;
      increased risk of hospitalization, quality of life impairment, and death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is a technique used most commonly as a cancer&#xD;
      treatment, whereby a precise, high dose of radiation is delivered to a target. For patients&#xD;
      with VT refractory to medication and catheter ablation, noninvasive targeting of the&#xD;
      arrhythmogenic substrate with SBRT (in this case termed cardiac radioablation, CRA) is an&#xD;
      emerging technique demonstrating favorable efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a protocol similar to that utilized by the phase I/II ENCORE-VT trial (NCT02919618),&#xD;
      this study aims to replicate previously reported favorable results in a multi-institutional&#xD;
      setting. Accrued patients will receive CRA to 25 Gy in a single fraction.&#xD;
