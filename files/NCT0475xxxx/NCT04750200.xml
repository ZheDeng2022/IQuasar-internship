  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      EMMA-Can is an open-label randomized control trial comparing the recurrence risk in patients&#xD;
      with chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) undergoing standard of care treatment (surgical&#xD;
      drainage and/or medical management) with or without embolization of the middle meningeal&#xD;
      (EMMA).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients in clinical need of surgical drainage or medical management for the CSDH will be&#xD;
      randomized in our study. Patients that present in the Emergency Department (ED) or&#xD;
      neurosurgery clinic will be assessed for standard of care treatment options based on their&#xD;
      presenting symptoms; this may include surgical drainage or medical management. Patients will&#xD;
      then by screened for study eligibility based on the study inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
      After screening and consenting patients will be randomized in to the control arm or&#xD;
      interventional arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomized to the control arm will undergo institutional standard of care treatment&#xD;
      (surgical drainage and/or medical management) of the CSDH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomized to the interventional arm will undergo institutional standard of care&#xD;
      treatment (surgical drainage and/or medical management) of the CSDH as per the standard of&#xD;
      care in the institution. These patients will then undergo EMMA within 48 hours after&#xD;
      finishing the surgical drainage. The embolic agent and use of general anaesthesia versus&#xD;
      conscious sedation will be left to operators' preference and the institutional protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be followed as per the institutional standard of the care. Any&#xD;
      peri-procedural complications and change in clinical status will be recorded. The risk of&#xD;
      recurrence at 90-days in patients who undergo standard of care treatment (surgical and/or&#xD;
      medical management) of CSDH with or without EMMA will be observed.&#xD;

    <description>EMMA is performed inside of the blood vessels where tiny catheters are used to deliver polymer embolic agents to block small blood vessels supplying the brain coverings. A particulate polymer embolic agent (also called polyvinyl acrylate, PVA) or a liquid embolic agents (polymers of ethynyl vinyl alcohol, EVOH) can be used.</description>

&#xD;
          2. Patients requiring surgery or has at least 10 mm of CSDH on CT head and has one or&#xD;
             more symptoms attributable to CSDH, including headache, cognitive impairment, ataxia,&#xD;
             seizure, focal neurologic deficit, or decreased consciousness.&#xD;
&#xD;

          1. If informed consent can not be obtained from the patients or their substitute decision&#xD;
             makers.&#xD;
&#xD;

             branches of internal carotid arteries.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Contraindication to the embolization procedure such as severe renal dysfunction, or&#xD;
