  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This a phase II-III study. In the single-armed phase II period, HX008, a monoclonal antibody&#xD;
      targeting PD-1, will be combined with pemetrexed+platinum (Investigators choice of cisplatin&#xD;
      or carboplatin) chemotherapy to treat participants with advanced or metastatic nonsquamous&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have not previously received systemic therapy for&#xD;
      advanced disease. When the preliminary efficacy and safety data are acquired, a&#xD;
      single-blinded phase III study will ensue, in which the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      HX008+pemetrexed+platinum VS pembrolizumab+pemetrexed+platinum in participants of the same&#xD;
      population will be compared head-to-head with 1:1 randomization. The primary endpoints are&#xD;
      safety and ORR (overall response rate) evaluated by the investigator in phase II study, and&#xD;
      PFS evaluated by IRC (independent review committee) in phase III study. The primary&#xD;
      hypothesis in phase III study is that HX008+pemetrexed+platinum is non-inferior to&#xD;
      pembrolizumab+pemetrexed+platinum in terms of PFS (Progression-Free Survival).&#xD;

             drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid&#xD;
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a&#xD;
             form of systemic treatment.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Had prior treatment with any anti-PD-1, or PD-L1 or PD-L2 agent or an antibody&#xD;
             targeting other immuno-regulatory receptors or mechanisms. Examples of such antibodies&#xD;

             known quantitative HCV RNA results greater than the lower limits of detection of the&#xD;
             assay. Those with HBV DNA viral load or copy number lower than the lower limits of&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Has known psychiatric or mental disorders, such as epilepsy, dementia, or a known&#xD;
             regular user of any illicit drugs, or had a recent history (within the last year) of&#xD;

             requirements of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has symptomatic ascites or pleural effusion. A subject who is clinically stable&#xD;
             following treatment for these conditions (including therapeutic paracentesis) is&#xD;

             affect respiratory function, such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, organic pneumonia&#xD;
             / bronchiolitis obliterans, etc (except for local pneumonia induced by radiotherapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the&#xD;
             projected duration of the study.&#xD;
