  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute appendicitis is the most frequent non-obstetric surgical emergency during pregnancy.&#xD;
      The benefits of laparoscopy during pregnancy are well known, but complications can occur, and&#xD;
      these can affect both the mother and/or the foetus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: Evaluate results of laparoscopic surgical treatment of acute appendicitis in&#xD;
      pregnant women, to analyse the occurrence of adverse postoperative, obstetric and foetal&#xD;
      outcomes Methods: Retrospective cohort single-centred observational study on pregnant women&#xD;
      with a preoperative diagnosis of acute appendicitis,using computerized medical records'&#xD;
      information of pregnant patients admitted to our institution between September 2005 and July&#xD;
      2020&#xD;

      Construction and analysis of the database and study protocol were authorized by the&#xD;
      Institutional Evaluation Committee under NÂ° B20-010 and P20-070, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assuming a 3: 1 relationship between surgery within 48 hours of symptom onset and surgery&#xD;
      after 48 hours of 3: 1, we have an 80% power to find a difference in postoperative morbidity&#xD;
      between groups of 30% with error type I of .05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysed variables include: demographic characteristics, gestational age, clinical&#xD;
      presentation, symptom duration from onset until surgical resolution, complementary studies,&#xD;
      ASA score (Classification of the American Society of Anaesthesiology), intraoperative&#xD;
      findings, type of surgery performed, intra and postoperative complications, length of stay,&#xD;
      readmissions, use of tocolytics, preterm delivery, birth weight, Apgar score, maternal and&#xD;
      foetal mortality, and obstetric and perinatological complications in pregnant patients with a&#xD;
      preoperative diagnosis of acute appendicitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any surgery in which the exploratory laparoscopy did not reveal intra-abdominal pathology and&#xD;
      the appendix was macroscopically and microscopically normal was classified as a &quot;negative&#xD;
      laparoscopy&quot;. An &quot;intraoperative complication&quot; was defined as any unexpected intraoperative&#xD;
      event, excluding conversion to conventional surgery, which was analysed as an independent&#xD;
      event. A &quot;postoperative complication&quot; was defined as any deviation from the usual&#xD;
      postoperative course within 30 days of surgery. An &quot;obstetric complication&quot; was one that&#xD;
      occurred from the appendectomy until the end of the pregnancy, including foetal death and&#xD;
      excluding preterm delivery. Spontaneous abortion and foetal demise were included within the&#xD;
      same &quot;foetal loss&quot; outcome. &quot;Preterm labour&quot; was considered to be deliveries or caesarean&#xD;
      sections that occurred prior to the 37th week of gestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For continuous variables, mean, standard deviation and / or minimum and maximum, or median&#xD;
      and interquartile interval (IQR) were used, according to distribution. For categorical&#xD;
      variables the number and corresponding percentages were reported. Continuous parameter&#xD;
      comparisons were made using the test for independent samples or Wilcoxon-rank test; and when&#xD;
      there were more than two groups, Anova or Kruskal Wallis were applied. For the comparison of&#xD;
      categorical variables, Chi-square or Fisher's exact test were used, as appropriate. A p &lt;0.05&#xD;
      was considered statistically significant. Likewise, a multivariate analysis was performed for&#xD;
      the presence of postoperative and obstetric complications, contemplating possible&#xD;
      confounders.&#xD;
