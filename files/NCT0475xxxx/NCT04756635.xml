  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The therapeutic use of caloric restriction and intermittent fasting (IF) protocols improves&#xD;
      life span and health related quality of life. The effects of fasting protocols on athletic&#xD;
      performance and training adaptations have been primarily studied in athletes undergoing the&#xD;
      Ramadan IF protocol or in athletes willing to decrease body fat, while maintaining or&#xD;
      increasing lean body mass. Data from these studies are somewhat conflicting and unclear.&#xD;
      Moreover, the effects of IF on muscular strength, as well as in aerobic and anaerobic&#xD;
      capacity remain largely unknown. Anecdotal evidence from experienced participants in&#xD;
      strength, power and endurance training or sports, indicates an increased ability to acutely&#xD;
      display higher levels of work capacity in the fasted vs. fed state. The goal of this project&#xD;
      is to determine the effects of 4 wks of IF on neuromuscular performance, aerobic and&#xD;
      anaerobic capacity of well-trained young adults.&#xD;

      This 3-year project will include two groups of participants: 1) young men accustomed to&#xD;
      resistance training (study #1) and 2) young men accustomed to endurance training (study #2).&#xD;
      Inclusion will be limited to healthy participants (i.e. nonsmokers, normotensive with&#xD;
      systolic and diastolic values &lt;135/85 mmHg, non-obese, non-medicated, and free of any known&#xD;
      disease as assessed by medical history) (Pickering, Hall et al. 2005). Month 1-3 will focus&#xD;
      on literature review and month 4 to 8 will address experimental settings preparation and&#xD;
      selection of participants to include in each study. Testing and data collection will be&#xD;
      scheduled for months 9-14 and 13-18 (study # 1 and 2 related testing, respectively). Data&#xD;
      processing, analysis and presentation will occur from month 21 to 33. All participants will&#xD;
      read and sign an informed consent document with the description of the testing procedures.&#xD;
      The Faculty's ethical committee will be asked to approve this document before testing. All&#xD;
      studies will follow a randomized crossover design, with measures taken before and after the&#xD;
      defined IF periods and participants of each group serving as their own controls. Two groups&#xD;
      of participants will be included in this project: 1) group #1: resistance trained group&#xD;
      (tested for neuromuscular function, anaerobic capacity and body composition); 2) group #2:&#xD;
      endurance trained group (tested for aerobic and anaerobic capacity and body composition). In&#xD;
      a randomized, counterbalanced manner, all participants will be tested in two different&#xD;
      conditions: control condition (pre- and post4 wks of normal diet) vs. experimental condition&#xD;
      (pre- and post-4 wks of IF). A 2-wk washout period will separate both conditions.&#xD;
      Measurements will be taken during the morning period (between 07:00 and 11:00 am) in the&#xD;
      fasted state. Neuromuscular function and anaerobic capacity will be assessed on separate days&#xD;
      (with at least a 48- hour interval) to ensure full recovery.&#xD;
