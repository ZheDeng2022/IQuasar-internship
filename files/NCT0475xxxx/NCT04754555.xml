  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Upper limb impairment occurs in approximately 70 to 80 per cent of adults post stroke. These&#xD;
      impairments will have consequences on functional performance in activities of daily living&#xD;
      and hence quality of life. Assessment of upper limb function is a component of rehabilitation&#xD;
      that contributes to the selection of optimal interventions according to patient&#xD;
      individualized needs. The Arm Activity Measure (ArmA) provides a standardized assessment of&#xD;
      upper limb passive and active perceived performance that is only available in it's English&#xD;
      version. The aim of this study is to translate and conduct a cross-cultural adaptation of the&#xD;
      ArmA is order to investigate its psychometric properties through a validation study among&#xD;
      stroke patients.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Assessment of the upper limb post-stroke should be standardized and holistic, representative&#xD;
      of multidimensional consequences according the International Classification of Function and&#xD;
      Disability (CIF). Measures should demonstrate established psychometric properties, in terms&#xD;
      of validity, reproducibility and responsiveness to change. The ArmA allows standardized&#xD;
      measurement of both passive and active functions of the upper limb in terms of perceived&#xD;
      performance under the activity level of the CIF. To date there is no measure that allows&#xD;
      assessment of both upper limb functions of perceived performance in the French language.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to this study, a translation and cross-cultural adaptation (TCCA) of the ArmA was&#xD;
      performed in accordance with study objectives and identified gap in the literature. TCCA was&#xD;
      conducted in accordance with guidelines for subjective outcome measures contributing to&#xD;
      evidence-based practice (Beaton et al., 2000). A six-step translation procedure for&#xD;
      self-reported outcome measures was relevant of clinical use in a foreign language. A&#xD;
      multidisciplinary team ensured a forwards-backwards translation and cross-cultural&#xD;
      adaptation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An observational, single-center, cross-sectional study design will be implemented to&#xD;
      determine the psychometric properties of the French ArmA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be from a post-stroke rehabilitation service (as part of their usual care).&#xD;
      For the analysis of reliability properties, participants will be hospitalized as part of&#xD;
      routine care and participation in the protocol (T0, T1 and T2 assessments) will add 1 to 2&#xD;
      hours of assessment to routine care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessors will be trained Occupational Therapists having participated in the development of&#xD;
      the measure.&#xD;

Data collection on perceived upper limb performance with the two-step F-ArmA measurement (T0 and T1) will allow the primary outcome (ICC2,1) to be calculated to establish inter-rater reproducibility. ArmA and MAL will be administered on 3 separate occasions by 2 separate assessors.</description>
