  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to compare the energy consumption and exercise intensities&#xD;
      obtained from an activity classifier obtained from a triaxial acceleration signal collected&#xD;
      from the wrist and hip during active video games in children with ambulated Cerebral Palsy. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      All 20 individuals with CP will participate in a total of 2 exercise sessions on consecutive&#xD;
      days with 45 minutes of active video games. In two exercise season individuals will play 4&#xD;
      games that were previously determined and experienced for about 45 minutes. During the&#xD;
      training sessions, exercise intensity will be evaluated with the accelerometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The accelerometer will be placed on the dominant wrist of 20 individuals during one training&#xD;
      session. The same 20 individuals will participate in the other exercise session and the&#xD;
      accelerometer will be placed on the dominant side hip area of the individuals this time.&#xD;
      Exercise intensity values obtained from 2 different training sessions will be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise intensity will be measured by an ActiGraph wGT3X-BT triaxial accelerometer during&#xD;
      the interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For both intervention sessions, a statistical comparison will made between groups in terms of&#xD;
      energy consumption, activity counts, and active duration.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      More validation studies are needed to document the most appropriate place (wrist or waist) to&#xD;
      capture limb movement and / or energy consumption (capturing) during physical activity in&#xD;
      children with CP at different functional levels. Such information has the potential to guide&#xD;
      interventions to improve daily activity throughout life, with potential implications for&#xD;
      participation and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to compare the energy consumption and exercise intensities&#xD;
      obtained from an activity classifier obtained from a triaxial acceleration signal collected&#xD;
      from the wrist and hip during active video games in children with ambulated Cerebral Palsy.&#xD;
      Thus, it is thought that reaching the targeted physical activity intensity with active video&#xD;
      games in individuals with CP in the clinic can be evaluated with an appropriate and accurate&#xD;
      accelerometer placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional levels of individuals will be determined according to GMFCS. All 20 individuals&#xD;
      with CP will participate in a total of 2 exercise sessions with on consecutive days with 45&#xD;
      minutes of active video games. In two exercise season individuals will play 4 games that were&#xD;
      previously determined and experienced for about 45 minutes. During the training sessions,&#xD;
      exercise intensity will be evaluated with the accelerometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The accelerometer will be placed on the dominant wrist of 20 individuals during one training&#xD;
      session. The same 20 individuals will participate in the other exercise session and the&#xD;
      accelerometer will be placed on the dominant side hip area of the individuals this time.&#xD;
      Exercise intensity values obtained from 2 different training sessions will be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise intensity (energy consumption (MET), activity counts, active time during session)&#xD;
      will be measured by an ActiGraph wGT3X-BT triaxial accelerometer during the interventions.&#xD;
      After the measurements were over, the accelerometer data will be loaded on a personal&#xD;
      computer and manipulated in ActiLife software version 6.13.3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For both intervention sessions, a statistical comparison will made between groups in terms of&#xD;
      energy consumption, activity counts, and active duration. Statistical analysis will be&#xD;
      performed using SPSSc 22.00 package program. Number and percentage will be used for&#xD;
      demographic data, mean Â± standard deviation notation and descriptive data. In the dependent&#xD;
      variables, inter-measurement changes will be evaluated with Wilcoxon test, inter-measurement&#xD;
      changes in independent variables will be evaluated by Mann Whitney U test.&#xD;
