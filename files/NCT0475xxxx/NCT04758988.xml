      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The worldwide incidence of skin cancer has been rising for 50 years, in particular the&#xD;
      incidence of malignant melanoma has increased approx. 2-7% annually and is the most common&#xD;
      cancer amongst Danes aged 15-34. Currently there is a significant amount of misdiagnosis of&#xD;
      skin cancer and mole cancer, and most excised skin lesions are benign.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have shown that there is no significant increase in doctors diagnostic&#xD;
      accuracy during the first 6 years of clinical work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The resources spend on healthy people could be put to better use, if the Benign-Malignant&#xD;
      Ratio could be lowered. This could potentially be done by better educating the doctors during&#xD;
      their everyday clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to investigate the dose/response effect of an AI augmented training&#xD;
      and clinical feedback on the diagnostic accuracy of skin cancer and clinical decisions among&#xD;
      doctors from specialized skin cancer centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research question: How much specialized doctors need to train before their diagnostic&#xD;
      accuracy and clinical decisions change?&#xD;

      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a superiority trial designed as an international multicenter randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial of doctors in highly specialized centers that diagnose and/or treat skin-&#xD;
      and mole cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Eligible participants will be randomized into either the intervention or&#xD;
      control group, ratio 1:1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants of group A are given access to a digital educational online system developed&#xD;
      by the research group, are asked to register all skin lesions seen with a registration app&#xD;
      (clinical and dermoscopic photos and clinical data), also developed by the research group,&#xD;
      and will be given clinical feedback on every registered skin lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in group B are also asked from day one to register all skin lesions and will&#xD;
      receive feedback on these as the participants of group A, but are withheld their access to&#xD;
      the digital educational online system for 2 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feedback on removed/biopsied skin lesions is given directly from the pathologist, who in turn&#xD;
      are given easy access to photographs and clinical data of the patient and skin lesion in&#xD;
      question.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The average increase in diagnostic accuracy for the population of participating doctors as an&#xD;
      effect of the hours spent with the digital educational online system is calculated using&#xD;
      Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As benign lesions can be excised/treated for other reasons than suspicion of malignancy we&#xD;
      will analyze correctly diagnosed benign lesions treated for different reasons (cosmetic or&#xD;
      functional complaints etc.) separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We expect a majority of registered lesions to be benign, despite most of the patients already&#xD;
      having been seen by GPs before referral.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient participation contains no immediate strain or discomfort for the patient, and no&#xD;
      change to current clinical practice, as dermoscopic evaluation is part of the clinical&#xD;
      examination of skin lesions. The images captured are stored safely and anonymously with no&#xD;
      risk for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the current low diagnostic accuracy of young doctors the educational nature of the&#xD;
      intervention justifies the study for the sake of all future patients with skin lesions that&#xD;
      are less likely to be misdiagnosed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Educational interventions on doctors do not require approval by The National Committee on&#xD;
      Health Research Ethics in Denmark. However ethical considerations have been made and the&#xD;
      project is in concordance with the Helsinki Declaration II.&#xD;
