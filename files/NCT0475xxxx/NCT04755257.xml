  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Today, the most commonly used position is the seated position with 45° of shoulder abduction&#xD;
      (Abd) in the scapular plane, known as the most functional isokinetic assessment of&#xD;
      shoulder-rotator strength (1). However, considering the architectural feature of the rotator&#xD;
      muscles, a position where the maximum sarcomere length is obtained, in which the maximum&#xD;
      muscle strength is produced, has not been investigated. Ward et al. showed that the shoulder&#xD;
      position, in which the sarcomere length of the muscles was between 2.0 - 2.6 µm, was 25⁰ Abd&#xD;
      and 20⁰ external rotation (ER) as a result of their study on the rotator cuff muscles&#xD;
      architecture (2). The test position selected in isokinetic measurements is the main factor&#xD;
      for outcome measurements and the repeatability of the measurements directly depends on the&#xD;
      selected position (3). This study was planned to investigate the effects of the position&#xD;
      where the shoulder is at 25⁰ Abd and 20⁰ ER to develop the most suitable isokinetic strength&#xD;
      evaluation position based on muscle architecture for shoulder rotator muscles.Using IsoMed&#xD;
      2000 device (D. &amp; R. Ferstl GmbH, Hemau, Germany) we conducted the isokinetic test of&#xD;
      concentric (CON) and eccentric (ECC) shoulder internal (IR) and external (ER) strength at the&#xD;
      angular velocity of 60˚/s in both Method I (scapular position) and Method II (25⁰ Abd and 20⁰&#xD;
      ER). There were seven days between the testing sessions, and both tests were conducted at the&#xD;
      same time of day. The same examiner with experience in performing isokinetic testing with&#xD;
      IsoMed 2000 tested all subjects in both testing sessions&#xD;
