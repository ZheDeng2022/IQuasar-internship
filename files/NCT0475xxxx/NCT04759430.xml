      This study aims to investigate the effects of telerehabilitation and supervised stabilization&#xD;
      exercises on pain, functionality, kinesophobia and quality of life in individuals with&#xD;
      non-specific chronic low back pain. 72 individuals who voluntarily agree to participate in&#xD;
      the study will be included. This study divides the patients in three groups: the supervised&#xD;
      group: face-to-face stabilization exercises are applied, the telerehabilitation group:&#xD;
      treatment through online meetings, and the control group: patients will do home-based&#xD;
      exercises that prescribed by physiothrerapist. Evaluations will be made by the same&#xD;
      physiotherapist. The researcher who will make the measurements in this study will not know&#xD;
      which treatment program was applied to the participants. In this study, The same&#xD;
      stabilization exercises will be applied in three different groups. Ten different&#xD;
      stabilization exercises will be applied to the participants. Exercises will be performed for&#xD;
      20-30 minutes in each session, three times a week, for four weeks in total, twelve sessions.&#xD;
      Clinical and demographic data of the 72 people participating in the study will be taken&#xD;
      before treatment. Participants will also fill out questionnaires before and after the&#xD;
      treatment that involve; the Oswestry Disability Index to measure(ODI) daily life activity&#xD;
      limitations; the Visual Analogue Scale(VAS) for assessing the intensity of pain; Tampa Scale&#xD;
      for Kinesiophobia(TSK) to assess fear of movement; and the Short Form(SF-36) in order to&#xD;
      assess self-perceived health-related quality of life. Statistical analysis is going to be&#xD;
      used in this research through the SPSS 20.0 package program.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Today, low back pain is one of the most common health problems in the world in which create a&#xD;
      considerable individual, social and financial burden on the society. Low back pain is&#xD;
      classified as specific and nonspecific. While, 10 percent of the paints are suffered from&#xD;
      specific low back pain, non-specific low back pain is occured in approximately 90 percent of&#xD;
      the population. If low back pain persists for six weeks, it is classified as acute back pain,&#xD;
      subacute back pain between six weeks and three months, and chronic low back pain if it lasts&#xD;
      for more than three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is a complex problem that continues for a long time without a&#xD;
      cause and is the most common in the musculoskeletal system, leading to disability.&#xD;
      Individuals with CLBP have a lower quality of life than the general population. It causes&#xD;
      individuals to decrease their activities due to pain and prepares the ground for the&#xD;
      continuation of pain. Lack of movement caused by pain in individuals; It negatively affects&#xD;
      the quality of life by triggering the continuation of symptoms, causing a decrease in&#xD;
      functional levels, limitation in daily life activities, problems in family and work life.&#xD;
      There are many physical, psychological and social factors that cause low back pain to become&#xD;
      chronic. Age, race, occupation, obesity, smoking, alcohol consumption and stress are the most&#xD;
      important factors that trigger the chronicity of low back pain. The effectiveness of a&#xD;
      multidisciplinary treatment program and determination of risk factors in the management of&#xD;
      CLBP is known. Treatment approaches include medical treatment, surgical treatment and&#xD;
      physiotherapy applications. In physiotherapy programs, patient education, back schools,&#xD;
      electrotherapy applications, traction, massage, superficial heat applications, corsets and&#xD;
      exercise approaches are used. Stretching exercises, trunk flexion-extension exercises,&#xD;
      resistantce exercises, stabilization exercises are the main exercise approaches used to cope&#xD;
      with low back pain. In addition to exercises performed under the supervision of a&#xD;
      physiotherapist, home exercise programs are also provided for low back pain. Stabilization&#xD;
      exercises have various benefits on the musculoskeletal system. Stabilization exercises that&#xD;
      aim to protect and support the spine by regenerating muscle control, applied in muscle&#xD;
      activation losses caused by injury or degenerative changes, increase strength and&#xD;
      flexibility. Stabilization exercise has been reported to be effective in reducing pain and&#xD;
      improving functional disability in patients with nonspecific CLBP, improving individuals&#xD;
      psychologically and also increasing the quality of life of patients. Stabilization exercises&#xD;
      have been found to be effective in increasing the cross-sectional area of the lumbar&#xD;
      multifidus muscle, which is one of the muscles needed to maintain the proper stability of the&#xD;
      spine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Today, in line with technological developments, the use of common information processing,&#xD;
      sensor networks, three-dimensional (3D) computer graphics, internet and mobile phone&#xD;
      applications in healthcare services is widespread. Telerehabilitation refers to the provision&#xD;
      of rehabilitation services through information and communication technologies. Clinically&#xD;
      this term; covers a range of rehabilitation and habilitation services including assessment,&#xD;
      monitoring, prevention, response, control, training, consultation and counseling. Along with&#xD;
      telerehabilitation, rehabilitation practices can be applied in health centers as well as&#xD;
      homes, schools or community-based work sites. Mostly, there are studies in the literature&#xD;
      regarding its use in musculoskeletal disorders, coronary heart disease, some types of cancer,&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes, hypertension and physically disabled individuals. Due to the social distance&#xD;
      and isolation, which are the effects of the covid-19, which spread in a short time in our&#xD;
      country and all over the world, there are disruptions in individuals' continuing their&#xD;
      treatment. Telerehabilitation allows one-to-one physiotherapist-patient meetings without the&#xD;
      need for contact and provides flexibility to patients in terms of time. Exercise is one of&#xD;
      the treatments that physiotherapists can give using telerehabilitation. With the applications&#xD;
      made with telerehabilitation, individuals are provided to take an active role in their own&#xD;
      rehabilitation and individuals can have the ability to manage themselves.&#xD;

    <description>The Oswestry Disability Index(ODI) is an extremely important tool that researchers and disability evaluators use to measure a patient's permanent functional disability. The test is considered the 'gold standard' of low back functional outcome tools. Scores between 0-5 are given for each question on the scale consisting of 10 questions. Questions are on travel, social life, sex life, sleeping, standing, sitting, walking, lifting things and personal precautions. Maximum score is 50, minimum score is 0.</description>

    <description>The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) is a scale used to determine the intensity of pain experienced by individuals. It consists of a line approximately 10-15 cm long; the patient is asked to mark his pain level on the line between the two endpoints. The distance between 'no pain at all' and the mark then defines the subject's pain the left side means no pain with 0 points, while the right side means 10 points the worst pain ever.</description>

    <description>The Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobiais (TSK) is 17 items a self-reporting questionnaire based on evaluation of fear of movement, fear of physical activity, and fear avoidance. It was first developed to distinguish between non-excessive fear and phobia in patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain, specifically the fear of movement in patients with chronic low back pain then widely used for different parts of the body. The questionnaire using 4 points to assess that are based on; the model of fear-avoidance, fear of work-related activities, fear of movement, and fear of re-injury.(1 = Strongly Disagree, 4 = Strongly Agree).The total score of the scale range from 17-68, where 17 means no kinesiophobia, 68 means severe kinesiophobia.</description>

    <description>The 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36) is an oft-used, well-researched, self-reported measure of health. It comprises 36 questions which cover eight domains of health:1) Limitations in physical activities because of health problems 2) Limitations in social activities because of physical or emotional problems 3) Limitations in usual role activities because of physical health problems 4) Bodily pain 5) General mental health (psychological distress and well-being) 6) Limitations in usual role activities because of emotional problems 7) Vitality (energy and fatigue) 8) General health perceptions. The SF-36 is often used as a measure of a person or population's quality of life (QOL). In addition, each item is scored on a 0 to 100 range so that the lowest and highest possible scores are 0 and 100, respectively.</description>
