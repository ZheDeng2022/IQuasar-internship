      The aim: The evaluation of the influence of a probiotics therapy on mood improvement and the&#xD;
      reduction of depressive symptoms in women in the perimenopausal age group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesis: By using periodic probiotics therapy it is possible to positively&#xD;
      influence the mood of women with depressive syndromes. These efforts focus on the improvement&#xD;
      of the functioning of the gut barrier and gut-brain axis. In practice, such activities should&#xD;
      lead to the reduction in the dysfunction of the barrier, the reduction of endotoxemia and the&#xD;
      concentration of neurotoxic metabolites of tryptophan (in blood) with the simultaneous&#xD;
      increase in the content of butyric acid that has a neuroprotective effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The of the trial: intervention, cohort, randomized, double-blind, using placebo. A&#xD;
      multi-strain probiotic will also be provided ( Bifidobacterium bifidum W23, Bifidobacterium&#xD;
      lactis W52, Lactobacillus acidophilus W37, Lactobacillus brevis W63, Lactobacillus casei W56,&#xD;
      Lactobacillus salivarius W24, Lactococcus lactis W19 and Lactococcus lactis W58 or maize&#xD;
      starch, maltodextrins and vegetable protein/placebo).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The applied method of study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. a controlled dietary intervention that includes probiotics therapy; the verification of&#xD;
           the past nutritional pattern (the Food Frequency Questionnaire); anthropometric&#xD;
           measurements;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. psychiatric studies: the evaluation of sleep disorders (the Athens insomnia scale) and&#xD;
           mood (the Beck scale), and the worsening of depression (the Hamilton scale);&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. biochemical studies: the content of short chain fatty acids (in the stool);&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. cytometric studies (B-type lymphocytes' panel, T-type lymphocytes' panel, regulatory T&#xD;
           cells' panel);&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. genetic (the microbiome of bacteria in the stool, pyrosequencing);&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. chromatographic (the derivatives of tryptophan e.g., kynurenine, anthranilic acid,&#xD;
           kynureic acid, 3-hydroxykynurenine, 5-hydroxytryptophan, serotonin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there is an urgent problem to develop recommendations regarding the nutrition and&#xD;
      probiotics therapy that could complement the therapy of women with mood disorders. If the&#xD;
      achieved results confirm the study hypothesis, it will be possible to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. better understand the pathomechanism of mood disorders in the perimenopausal period;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. develop a holistic strategy for depressive disorders in women in the menopause period.&#xD;
