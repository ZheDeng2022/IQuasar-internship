  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have thought with a dedicated research group, to deepen the use of&#xD;
      receptive music therapy so that it can improve the non-nutritive sucking of premature babies&#xD;
      through listening to lullabies sung by parents and by the music therapist, which can reduce&#xD;
      the use feeding tube and the negative effects on stress or growth of the newborn. The&#xD;
      acquisition of oral skills and the achievement of a complete autonomous suction are of&#xD;
      fundamental importance for the discharge of the preterm infant. Some studies published in the&#xD;
      literature suggest that listening to the mother's voice and lullabies can represent a&#xD;
      positive auditory stimulus for babies to support nutritional and non-nutritive sucking (NNS).&#xD;
      Positive reinforcement is an effective development strategy for improving the feeding skills&#xD;
      of preterm infants. A brief receptive music therapy intervention with the infant's personal&#xD;
      pacifier that plays lullabies sung by both parents or by the music therapist could reduce the&#xD;
      use of the feeding tube and the length of hospitalization. The possible negative effects of&#xD;
      this stimulation on infant stress or growth remain to be explored. The aim of this study is&#xD;
      not only to evaluate the benefits of positive reinforcement on the nutritional sucking&#xD;
      competence of the premature baby, but at the same time also to observe the possible effects&#xD;
      on his well-being and on his clinical stability.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In preterm infant, oral feeding requires significant maturation of the nervous system to&#xD;
      support coordination of the oropharyngeal muscles and breathing. Additionally, the energy&#xD;
      expenditure required by nutritional sucking attempts further complicates the acquisition of&#xD;
      oral feeding skills and must be balanced by caloric intake to achieve sufficient growth.&#xD;
      Achievement of exclusive autonomous sucking typically occurs only between 34 and 36&#xD;
      post-conception weeks. However, delays in achieving full oral sucking are common and may&#xD;
      prolong the infant's hospitalization.Non-nutritive sucking (NNS) is a coordinated motor skill&#xD;
      that can be taught through an educational activity that conditions neuronal responses through&#xD;
      positive reinforcement.The international literature demonstrates that, through a behavioral&#xD;
      approach, the use of the pacifier during non-nutritive sucking promotes nutritional sucking&#xD;
      in preterm infants, improving their attachment and bottle feeding, and determines the&#xD;
      reduction of the length of stay in intensive care. and improved general well-being of the&#xD;
      newborn.The use of receptive music therapy can therefore be supportive and represent a&#xD;
      positive reinforcement for the development and acquisition of oral and nutritional skills of&#xD;
      the preterm infant. By taking advantage of non-nutritive sucking it is possible to improve&#xD;
      the suckling capacity of the newborn, his feeding speed, weight gain and consequently reduce&#xD;
      the length of hospital stay. It is essential to achieve this result without negatively&#xD;
      affecting the well-being and stability of the preterm infant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although musical studies in premature infants are limited, a 2014 study published in&#xD;
      Pediatrics highlighted how music-specific and the maternal voice can positively reinforce the&#xD;
      behavioral and neural responses of the preterm infant.On the other hand, the possible similar&#xD;
      effects of reproduction, through the use of receptive music therapy of the song of the father&#xD;
      and / or the music therapist, have not yet been investigated. The investigators therefore&#xD;
      decided to design a prospective, randomized and controlled study to test the hypothesis that&#xD;
      the parental (maternal and / or paternal) and / or music therapist's chant influences the&#xD;
      well-being and / or stress of the newborn, evaluated through the parameter Heart Rate&#xD;
      Variability (HRV), NNS development, nutritional sucking capacity, weight growth, and length&#xD;
      of stay in premature infants compared to a control group of infants not subjected to sound&#xD;
      stimulation . 40 premature babies will be recruited to be divided into 4 groups, after&#xD;
      computerized randomization: n. 3 musical groups (mother song, father song, music therapist&#xD;
      song) and 1 control group (not subjected to musical stimulation). Infants with gestational&#xD;
      age at birth between the 23rd and 34th week of gestation will be included. Neonates with&#xD;
      intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) and periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) may also be&#xD;
      enrolled. Only newborns in ventilatory support at the time of evaluation and newborns with&#xD;
      maxillofacial malformations that may interfere with the ability to suck will be excluded from&#xD;
      enrollment. Newborns will be evaluated when they reach 32 ° -34 ° post-conception weeks, the&#xD;
      amount of milk taken orally (by sucking) must be less than 50% of the total enteral&#xD;
      intake.Infants who have not passed the subsequent hearing screening test using AABR (Brain&#xD;
      Stem Automatic Response Test) will be excluded from the analysis, which is expected to be&#xD;
      performed after reaching the correct age limit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOMES Positive reinforcement is an effective development strategy for improving the&#xD;
      feeding skills of preterm infants. A short receptive music therapy intervention that&#xD;
      reproduces lullabies sung by both parents or by the music therapist could positively&#xD;
      influence the acquisition of nutritional skills and the growth of the preterm infant.&#xD;
      Evaluating how this can affect the clinical stability of the newborn (and therefore on his&#xD;
      state of stress, measured in terms of HRV) represents a fundamental and primary point to&#xD;
      explore, in order to be able to make the possible use of receptive music therapy applicable&#xD;
      in the strategy of positive reinforcement. The objective of this study is therefore to&#xD;
      evaluate the tolerance of a receptive music therapy intervention (in terms of clinical&#xD;
      stability, assessed through the HRV parameter) by the enrolled infants and to investigate any&#xD;
      benefits of positive reinforcement obtained, through its use, on the acquisition of nutrition&#xD;
      and growth skills of preterm infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes: clinical stability by measuring Heart Rate Variability (HRV)&#xD;
&#xD;
      • The primary objective of this study is to evaluate and monitor the tolerance of receptive&#xD;
      music therapy (in terms of measurement of the clinical stability parameter HRV) by infants&#xD;
      during music therapy treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes: effects of positive reinforcement (carried out through the use of&#xD;
      receptive music therapy) on the acquisition of food skills and the growth of preterm infants.&#xD;
      In particular:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of the achievement of exclusive oral sucking (determined as a week&#xD;
           post-conception and / or days of life).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of the variation in the speed of meal intake between the beginning and the&#xD;
           end of the intervention (measured as the volume of the nutritional intake in milliliters&#xD;
           divided by the time in minutes required for consumption).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of the weight gain of the newborn in the 24 hours following stimulation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  (expressed as a percentage of weight gain from enrollment).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of the growth rate from the last day of treatment to discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Length of hospital stay.&#xD;
