  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this multi-centre phase I/II open-label, single-arm study is to determine the&#xD;
      safety, feasibility, therapeutic dose, and preliminary efficacy of psilocybin microdosing to&#xD;
      treat psychological distress among patients with advanced illness. Forty patients will&#xD;
      receive psilocybin drug product (1-3mg per day, Mon-Fri) for 4 weeks to be administered via&#xD;
      oral capsules by the participant. Feasibility (recruitment rate, rate of intervention and&#xD;
      follow-up completion), safety (rate of adverse events), dosing, and preliminary efficacy&#xD;
      (depression, anxiety, overall well-being, and global impression of change) will be measured.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with advanced illness report feeling a sense of hopelessness, loss of autonomy and&#xD;
      relationships, and a lack of purpose in life. These feelings of psychological suffering have&#xD;
      been described as &quot;existential distress&quot; and are associated with poor outcomes, including&#xD;
      decreased medication adherence and quality of life, increased desire for hastened death and&#xD;
      rates of suicide, and has been identified as a primary reason why individuals pursue medical&#xD;
      assistance in dying (MAiD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current treatments for psychological and existential suffering have low efficacy and are&#xD;
      challenging to use in a palliative context. Pharmacological approaches for treating&#xD;
      psychological suffering may reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety, but evidence to&#xD;
      support their efficacy in palliative care (PC) is underwhelming. Antidepressant and&#xD;
      anxiolytic medications also take time to work and can cause serious side effects such as&#xD;
      falls and confusion, which can be substantial deterrents for patients. Similarly, results&#xD;
      from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses have demonstrated&#xD;
      psychotherapeutic interventions show limited benefit in a PC population. Further,&#xD;
      psychotherapy can be time consuming and slow to work, which is not ideal for patients with&#xD;
      limited life expectancy. Given the burden of psychological and existential distress among&#xD;
      patients followed by PC providers, there is a need to develop scalable, brief, and rapidly&#xD;
      effective therapeutic approaches to reduce this distress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychedelic medications offer an innovative, safe, complementary approach to address&#xD;
      psychological and existential suffering in patients receiving PC. Studies from the 1950's&#xD;
      showed serotonergic hallucinogens (&quot;psychedelics&quot;) improved depression and anxiety symptoms&#xD;
      in cancer patients. However, legislative changes restricted the use of these medications in&#xD;
      clinical care and research. Interest in psychedelic medications has been rekindled by two&#xD;
      recently published RCTs that studied the use of psilocybin (a mushroom-derived 5HT2A agonist)&#xD;
      during a single psychotherapeutic session in cancer patients with anxiety and/or depression.&#xD;
      These trials demonstrated rapid, clinically meaningful, and long-lasting reductions in&#xD;
      depressed mood and/or anxiety symptoms and improvements in quality of life and death&#xD;
      acceptance. There is also evidence suggesting psilocybin microdosing - taking&#xD;
      sub-hallucinogenic doses continuously over longer time periods, rather than a one-time&#xD;
      hallucinogenic dose - can improve mood and anxiety. The effects of microdosing, however, have&#xD;
      not been rigorously evaluated, particularly in patients with life limiting illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results from recent trials are encouraging but knowledge gaps remain. First, studies to date&#xD;
      primarily enrolled patients with localized disease who experience different distress than&#xD;
      that of patients with advanced disease who are near the end of life. Second, it is unclear if&#xD;
      Canadians would find psilocybin an attractive option in the context of MAiD legalization,&#xD;
      which provides an alternative option for patients with severe psychological suffering. Third,&#xD;
      there is no empirical research on the therapeutic effects of psilocybin microdosing, as most&#xD;
      studies have followed macrodosing protocols. While preliminary efficacy of macrodosing has&#xD;
      been demonstrated, there are important barriers to administering this therapy in a PC&#xD;
      context. Previous trials had slow recruitment rates, suggesting there may be barriers related&#xD;
      to the acceptability of psilocybin macrodosing from the perspectives of patients and&#xD;
      families. Macrodosing requires the patient to dedicate an entire day to participating in a&#xD;
      guided hallucinogenic experience and remain in an acute care setting where they can be&#xD;
      closely monitored. It also requires patients to engage in preparatory sessions with monitors&#xD;
      and a post-therapy session. In a PC context, this time commitment may not be acceptable or&#xD;
      feasible for patients who are nearing the end of life. Additionally, macrodosing requires at&#xD;
      least two trained moderators to guide the patient through their psychedelic experience and&#xD;
      facilitate the pre- and post-dosing sessions. In most PC settings, it is not feasible to have&#xD;
      clinicians dedicate two days to a single patient, thus limiting the scalability of this&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psilocybin microdosing has the potential to overcome barriers to the feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability of macrodosing. By removing the requirement for trained moderators, minimizing&#xD;
      the time commitment required of patients, eliminating the hallucinogenic effects of the&#xD;
      therapy, and allowing patients to receive treatment either as an inpatient or in the&#xD;
      community, microdosing may be a more acceptable option to patients and families and allow&#xD;
      psychedelic therapy to be scalable across various PC settings. Psilocybin microdosing is a&#xD;
      novel, complementary therapy that, while still unproven for patients near the end of life,&#xD;
      has the potential to fundamentally change the way psychological and existential distress is&#xD;
      responded to in PC, improving the lives of the 30% of patients who experience this suffering&#xD;
      at the end of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine if psilocybin microdosing is a safe, feasible, and efficacious treatment for&#xD;
      psychological distress among patients nearing the end of life followed by palliative care&#xD;
      providers. All participants will receive a 4-week psilocybin microdosing intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size&#xD;
&#xD;
      As this is a feasibility study, no formal sample size calculation was performed to determine&#xD;
      the number of patients required to reach a level of precision on any study endpoint. Rather,&#xD;
      the goal of this study is to provide estimates, along with their margins of error, of the&#xD;
      recruitment rate and efficacy outcomes which will inform a subsequent two-arm randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial. Participating sites see approximately 5,300 patients per year. It is&#xD;
      anticipated that 30% will have psychological distress. Assuming a minimum of 1 in 6 patients&#xD;
      are eligible and 15% of eligible patients will enroll, the goal is to enroll a sample of 40&#xD;
      participants over a 1-year period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses will adopt an intent-to-treat approach. Because the goal of this trial is to&#xD;
      demonstrate feasibility and preliminary measures of efficacy, the main analyses will include&#xD;
      calculation of feasibility outcomes using descriptive statistics and 95% confidence intervals&#xD;
      (CIs), as well as effect sizes with 95% CIs for primary and secondary efficacy measures,&#xD;
      comparing patients' 4-week follow-up assessments to baseline assessments. Participants will&#xD;
      also be stratified based on demographic and clinical characteristics to assess trends in&#xD;
      outcomes. Notably, there is some evidence that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors&#xD;
      (SSRIs) in particular may attenuate the effects of psilocybin. As such, sub-analyses will&#xD;
      evaluate outcomes in participants taking an SSRI medication versus those who are not. A&#xD;
      sub-group analysis by setting of care (inpatient vs outpatient/community) will also be&#xD;
      conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses of safety data will include the mean and standard deviation of the peak effect&#xD;
      observed (i.e. highest observed blood pressure, heart rate) and proportion of participants&#xD;
      experiencing adverse mood and behaviour events. The incidence of delirium and serotonin&#xD;
      syndrome will also be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
