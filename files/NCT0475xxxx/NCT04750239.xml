  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adult patients with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) will be treated with nivatrotamab a&#xD;
      monoclonal anti GD2×CD3 bispecific antibody to investigate the safety and tolerability of the&#xD;
      drug.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will include a phase 1 dose escalation part to determine the maximum tolerated dose&#xD;
      (MTD) and the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). This will be conducted following a modified&#xD;
      Bayesian Optimal Interval Design (mBOIN) design. For the purpose of dose escalation,&#xD;
      dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) will be collected and assessed for a period of 28 days (the&#xD;
      DLT evaluation period).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A phase 2 dose expansion part will follow the phase 1 dose escalation. In phase 2, patients&#xD;
      will be stratified according to whether they have platinum sensitive or platinum-resistant&#xD;
      SCLC. Phase 2 will assess the long term safety and tolerability of nivatrotamab as well as&#xD;
      the clinical activity of nivatrotamab when administered at the obtained MTD/RP2D in phase 1.&#xD;
