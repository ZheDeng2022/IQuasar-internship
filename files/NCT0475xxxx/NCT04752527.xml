  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individualized induction therapy will be applied to the non-elderly acute myeloid leukemia&#xD;
      (AML) patients with adverse genetic risk features guided by rapid screening with fluorescence&#xD;
      in situ hybridization (FISH) and next-generation sequencing (NGS), such as the combination of&#xD;
      Venetoclax plus decitabine, and Sorafenib for patients with high (FMS)-like tyrosine kinase&#xD;
      3-internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) allelic ratio. This study aims to improve induction&#xD;
      therapy for non-elderly AML patients with adverse genetic risk features, reduce&#xD;
      treatment-related complications, and improve overall survival.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The non-elderly AML patients who meet the adverse risk group defined as 2017 European&#xD;
      LeukemiaNet (ELN) risk stratification, are more likely to be refractory to intensive&#xD;
      induction and have low rates of long-term survival. Venetoclax (drug name) plus decitabine or&#xD;
      azacitidine showed tolerable safety and favorable overall response rate (ORR )(complete&#xD;
      remission (CR)+CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi) rate: 67%) in elderly AML&#xD;
      patients. In addition, combination therapy with sorafenib, cytarabine and idarubicin was able&#xD;
      to induce a high CR rate in non-elderly AML patients with FLT3 mutations and a 1-year&#xD;
      probability of survival of 74%. The fast next-generation sequencing together with FISH can&#xD;
      identify the adverse genetic risk features in AML patients within 72 hours. Individualized&#xD;
      induction therapy will be applied to the non-elderly AML patients with adverse genetic risk&#xD;
      features guided by rapid screening with FISH and NGS, such as the combination of venetoclax&#xD;
      plus decitabine, and Sorafenib for patients with high FLT3-ITD allelic ratio. This study aims&#xD;
      to improve induction therapy for non-elderly AML patients with adverse genetic risk features,&#xD;
      reduce treatment-related complications, and improve overall survival.&#xD;
