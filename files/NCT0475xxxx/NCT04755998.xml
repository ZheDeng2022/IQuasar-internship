    <textblock>
      This study was conducted with a randomized controlled experimental design to determine the&#xD;
      effect of virtual reality headset on children's fear and anxiety during vaccinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 0a (H0a): There is no difference in fear scores between the experimental group in&#xD;
      which virtual reality glasses were used during vaccination administration and the control&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1a (H1a): There is a difference in fear scores between the experimental group in&#xD;
      which virtual reality glasses were used during vaccination administration and the control&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 0b (H0b): There is no difference in anxiety scores between the experimental group&#xD;
      in which virtual reality glasses were used during vaccination administration and the control&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1b (H1b): There is a difference in anxiety scores experienced between the&#xD;
      experimental group in which virtual reality glasses were used during vaccination&#xD;
      administration and the control group.&#xD;

      Interventions made for protecting health or curing diseases, significantly affect children's&#xD;
      psychological state and social adaptation. Being one of these interventions, vaccination may&#xD;
      cause fear and anxiety in children. This fear and anxiety may affect children's future&#xD;
      treatment and care experiences and result in fright and avoidance in them. Thus, it is&#xD;
      important to try and reduce biological stress and to cope with psychosocial stress. One of&#xD;
      the methods which can be used for this purpose is virtual reality headset used as a&#xD;
      distraction method. This study was conducted with a randomized controlled experimental design&#xD;
      to determine the effect of virtual reality headset on children's fear and anxiety during&#xD;
      vaccinations. The population of the study consisted of first grade students attending primary&#xD;
      schools in the city center of Ordu. The study was completed with 84 students in the&#xD;
      experimental group and 85 students in the control group. With the sample number obtained as a&#xD;
      result of the study, the test power was found to be 89.8% when the alpha error was 0.05 and&#xD;
      the effect size was kept at 0.5. The data were collected using the Child and Parent&#xD;
      Introductory Information Form, Children's Fear Scale, and Children's Anxiety Scale-State&#xD;
      Scale.&#xD;

    <measure>The Child Fear Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>with an average interval of three to five minutes</time_frame>
    <description>This scale is a one-item self-report measure for measuring pain-related fear in children. This one-item scale consists of five sex-neutral faces. It ranges from a no fear (neutral) face on the far left to a face showing extreme fear on the far right. It can be used for children aged 5-10 years.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The Children's Anxiety Scale-State Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>with an average interval of three to five minutes</time_frame>
    <description>It assesses children's anxiety in clinical settings and uses before medical procedures. The Children's Anxiety Scale-State Scale is drawn like a thermometer with a bulb at the bottom, also includes horizontal lines at intervals going up to the top. Children are asked to mark how he/she feel &quot;right now&quot; to measure state anxiety. Scores range from 0 to 10. It validated at children aged 4-10 years during an intravenous procedure.</description>

    <description>To the experimental group:&#xD;
Before the vaccine administration;&#xD;
Children's Fear Scale, and Children's Anxiety Scale-State Scale was applied to the student.&#xD;
Cartoons and virtual reality glasses that the student wanted to watch were prepared.&#xD;
While the nurse was preparing the vaccines, the student was put on virtual reality glasses and the distance settings of the lenses were adjusted and the cartoons he chose to watch during the vaccination applications started to be shown. Since virtual reality glasses can cause anxiety attacks manifested by nausea in some children, this was also tested beforehand. It took about two minutes to administer the vaccine and watch cartoons.&#xD;
Those applied after the vaccine administration;&#xD;
- Children's Fear Scale, and Children's Anxiety Scale-State Scale was applied to the student.</description>
