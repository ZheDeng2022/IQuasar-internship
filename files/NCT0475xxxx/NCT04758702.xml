    <textblock>
      A Randomized, Three Parallel Arms Clinical Trial. The primary objective is to assess the&#xD;
      clinical impact of L-PRF vs H-PRF vs Palatal stent on the healing of the donor palatal site&#xD;
      by comparing the percentage of re-epithelization of the palatal donor site at 5, 10, 14 and&#xD;
      21 days using a standardized intraoral palatal photo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to compare the post op discomfort between the three groups during&#xD;
      the healing period daily for 2 weeks using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and Analgesic&#xD;
      consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects from the University of Kentucky College of Dentistry clinics. Subjects that are&#xD;
      coming increasing the width of keratinized tissue or for the treatment of gingival recession,&#xD;
      and match the inclusion criteria will be told about the research and offered the opportunity&#xD;
      to participate.&#xD;

    <description>The secondary outcome is to compare the post-operative discomfort between the three groups during the healing period using the Visual Analogue Scale and Analgesic consumption. The visual analog scale is a validated, subjective measure for acute and chronic pain; with (0) indicates no pain and (10) indicates worst pain possible. Scores will be recorded by making a handwritten mark on a 10-cm line that represents a continuum between &quot;no pain&quot;, which is the (0) and &quot;worst pain possible&quot;, which is the (10). Also, the patient will write down his/her analgesic consumption, including the frequency and the amount used.</description>

    <description>Leucocyte-Platelet rich fibrin is a high density fibrin clot. it serves as a biological healing matrix by supporting cell migration and cytokine release, expanding the range of its potential applications greatly. Patient's own blood is centrifuged using (Intra-spin) FDA approved centrifuge on 45 degrees angle on 2700 rpm for 12 minutes.</description>

    <description>Platelet rich fibrin is a high density fibrin clot. it serves as a biological healing matrix by supporting cell migration and cytokine release, expanding the range of its potential applications greatly.Horizontally centrifuged platelet rich fibrin using (Bio-prf) centrifuge on 700 g force for 8 minutes. On a horizontal centrifugation, the cells separate much more efficiently throughout the entire membrane. This leads to better layer separation and also favors cells that are evenly distributed throughout the PRF clot.</description>
