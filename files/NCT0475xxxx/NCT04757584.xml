  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, we will test the feasibility of N-of-1 trials for deprescribing beta-blockers&#xD;
      in patients with Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction. To achieve this objective we&#xD;
      will conduct 16 4-period N-of-1 trials (on vs. off) and subsequently interview participants&#xD;
      to better understand feasibility and pragmatism. The N-of-1 trials will be iteratively&#xD;
      refined in real-time based on this feedback.&#xD;

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>This arm will follow an ABAB sequence. &quot;A&quot; representing ON beta blockers and &quot;B&quot; representing OFF beta blockers. Subjects in this arm will continue their home dose during the initial A period, they will then crossover into Period 2, where dose reduction will begin until they are off of beta blockers. During Period 3, they will restart beta-blockers, gradually uptitrating until reaching their home dose and finally during period 4, we will again conduct a dose reduction until off of beta blockers.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Beta Blocker BABA Sequence</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>This arm will follow a BABA sequence. &quot;A&quot; representing ON beta blockers and &quot;B&quot; representing OFF of beta blockers. Subjects in this arm will have their previously prescribed beta blocker dose reduced until they are completely off of beta blockers during Period 1. They will then crossover into Period 2, where uptitration will begin until they are back on their previously prescribed dose of beta blockers. During Period 3, we will again conduct a dose reduction, until the subject is off of beta blockers and finally during Period 4, we will uptitrate them back to their home dose of beta blockers.</description>

    <description>The intervention is a two-arm crossover withdrawal/ reversal design (On [A] vs Off [B]) with 4 periods, each period lasting up to 6 weeks. During the On period (A), subjects will be on their beta blocker. During the Off period (B), their beta blockers will be down titrated and subsequently discontinued.&#xD;
Subjects will be randomized into either ABAB or BABA sequences.</description>
