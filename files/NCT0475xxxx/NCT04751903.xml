      This study aimed to determine the effect of oral motor stimulation (OMS) in preterm infants&#xD;
      for successful feeding and sucking.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, with advances in methods of neonatal resuscitation and caring methods, the&#xD;
      survival rate of preterm infants has gradually increased. Sucking, swallow and respiratory&#xD;
      dysfunction are widespread complications in the preterm infants that reason oral feeding&#xD;
      difficulties. Safe and successful oral feeding requires proper maturation of sucking,&#xD;
      swallowing, and respiration. The development of behaviors necessary for safe and successful&#xD;
      nutrition begins long before birth. Jaw movements begin to be seen in the intrauterine 11th&#xD;
      week. But sucking-swallowing-respiratory coordination is not sufficiently developed before 34&#xD;
      weeks of gestation. For this reason, preterm babies at the greater gestational week usually&#xD;
      show more developed and consistent feeding skills. Maternal breast milk is best for&#xD;
      neurodevelopment in preterm infants. Achieve oral feeding and maternal breast milk as early&#xD;
      as possible is beneficial for preterm infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral motor stimulation (OMS) is defined as the sensorial stimulation of cheek, lip, jaw,&#xD;
      upper-lower gum, internal cheek, tongue and soft palate that affects the physiology of&#xD;
      oropharyngeal mechanisms and develops feeding functions. OMS used as an alternative or&#xD;
      supplementary early intervention strategy to develop oral feeding skills in preterm infants.&#xD;
      Previous studies have indicated that the use of OMS during or before the transition to oral&#xD;
      feeding may not only have positive effects on the preterm infants' feeding behaviors but also&#xD;
      enhance their general clinical course. Preterm infants who suffer from oral feeding problems&#xD;
      often experience longterm health problems and delayed discharge from the hospital. A more&#xD;
      effective feeding decreases adverse outcomes by decreasing hospital stays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preterm infants are required to prolonged NICU stay in order to stabilized, feeding, and gain&#xD;
      optimal weight. Increasing prematurity and reduced birth weight lead to extensive resource&#xD;
      utilization. In addition all nutritional options except breast milk increase the cost. OMS&#xD;
      can develop sucking success and provide early oral feeding. Thus nurse labor and hospital&#xD;
      costs may decrease and OMS can be a cost-effective application.&#xD;

    <masking_description>The study was conducted at neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of the university hospital located in eastern Turkey between May 5th, 2017 and March 19th, 2018. The preterm infants were randomly allocated to two groups, experimental group and control group, by a computer-generated number table. The sample consisted of 77 preterm infants (39 in the experimental group and 38 in the control group) who met the inclusion criteria. The gestational weeks when babies are born were grouped as follows: 29-30 weeks, 31-32 weeks, and 33-34 weeks. In this study, only one researcher (1st author) who was not included in the intensive care team administered OMS to all the infants. Thus, the families and the NICU team were double-blinded.</masking_description>

    <time_frame>36th gestational week , 5 minute</time_frame>
    <description>It was developed by Jensen, Wallace, &amp; Kelsay (1994). Demirhan (1997) conducted its Turkey validity test and revealed that it is a reliable and easy-to-use scale. Each criterion is rated in the point range of 0-2 points. Breastfeeding is then assessed based on the sum of these scores. The highest and lowest scores of the tool are 10 and 0, respectively, and higher scores signify breastfeeding/sucking success.</description>

    <description>Oral motor stimulation (OMS) is defined as the sensorial stimulation of cheek, lip, jaw, upper-lower gum, internal cheek, tongue and soft palate that affects the physiology of oropharyngeal mechanisms and develops feeding functions.It took 15 minutes to apply the OMS by lightly touching their cheeks, lips, gums, and tongue with fingertips for the first 12 minutes, followed by letting the infant suck on a pacifier for the remaining 3 minutes. OMS used as an alternative or supplementary early intervention strategy to develop oral feeding skills in preterm infants.</description>
