      This is an open-label, phase II umbrella trial assessing the anti-tumor activity of&#xD;
      enfortumab alone and in combination with other anti-cancer agents in subjects with metastatic&#xD;
      castration-resistant prostate cancer. The trial will open to enrollment in Cohort A,&#xD;
      enfortumab monotherapy. Additional cohorts may be added as new drug combinations are&#xD;
      identified.&#xD;
