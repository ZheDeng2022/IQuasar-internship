      Histopathological examination of liver tissue is used to determine the etiology and extent of&#xD;
      liver disease. In order for a clinician to make a better-informed decision regarding a&#xD;
      patient with liver disease, the liver biopsy specimen has to be adequate and of high quality&#xD;
      for pathological interpretation. It is generally agreed that an adequate liver biopsy has to&#xD;
      have ≥6-12 intact portal tracts for pathological review and interpretation.(1) Historically,&#xD;
      three approaches have been used to obtain a liver biopsy: percutaneous, transjugular (TJ-LB)&#xD;
      and laparoscopic approach (LA-LB)- with percutaneous liver biopsy (P-LB) being the most&#xD;
      commonly employed. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided liver biopsy (EUS-LB), a newer approach, is&#xD;
      now being performed by select skilled endoscopists across the country. EUS-LB is advantageous&#xD;
      over existing techniques because it enables visualization and avoidance of vessels that are&#xD;
      1mm in diameter, provides access to both lobes of the liver and theoretically is less painful&#xD;
      due to avoiding somatic pain fibers. Further, in patients that are already undergoing&#xD;
      esophagogastroduodenoscopy, EUS-LB can be performed simultaneously and spare the patient an&#xD;
      additional procedure. Because of the plausibility of reduced pain, number of procedures and&#xD;
      possibly complications, EUS-LB may be cost-effective over existing methods. There is limited&#xD;
      data evaluating the safety and efficacy of EUS-LB versus percutaneous liver biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hope to provide answers in a prospective study comparing between patients,&#xD;
      who are already undergoing liver biopsy, randomly assigned to either EUS-LB or P-LB. The&#xD;
      investigators will compare outcomes such as pain, bleeding, hospitalization, and tissue&#xD;
      diagnosis between the two groups. This will allow us to add to the existing data for the use&#xD;
      of EUS-LB. If patients are found to have less adverse events and better outcomes using EUS-LB&#xD;
      versus percutaneous-LB this may become the preferred method of diagnosis in this patient&#xD;
      population.&#xD;

        1. Provide no more than a one-page research abstract briefly stating the problem, the&#xD;
           research hypothesis, and the importance of the research.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Histopathological examination of liver tissue is used to determine the etiology and&#xD;
           extent of liver disease. In order for a clinician to make a better-informed decision&#xD;
           regarding a patient with liver disease, the liver biopsy specimen has to be adequate and&#xD;
           of high quality for pathological interpretation. It is generally agreed that an adequate&#xD;
           liver biopsy has to have ≥6-12 intact portal tracts for pathological review and&#xD;
           interpretation.(1) Historically, three approaches have been used to obtain a liver&#xD;
           biopsy: percutaneous, transjugular (TJ-LB) and laparoscopic approach (LA-LB)- with&#xD;
           percutaneous liver biopsy (P-LB) being the most commonly employed. Endoscopic&#xD;
           ultrasound-guided liver biopsy (EUS-LB), a newer approach, is now being performed by&#xD;
           select skilled endoscopists across the country. EUS-LB is advantageous over existing&#xD;
           techniques because it enables visualization and avoidance of vessels that are 1mm in&#xD;
           diameter, provides access to both lobes of the liver and theoretically is less painful&#xD;
           due to avoiding somatic pain fibers. Further, in patients that are already undergoing&#xD;
           EGD, EUS-LB can be performed simultaneously and spare the patient an additional&#xD;
           procedure. Because of the plausibility of reduced pain, number of procedures and&#xD;
           possibly complications, EUS-LB may be cost-effective over existing methods. There is&#xD;
           limited data evaluating the safety and efficacy of EUS-LB versus percutaneous liver&#xD;
           biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The investigators hope to provide answers in a prospective study comparing between&#xD;
           patients, who are already undergoing liver biopsy, randomly assigned to either EUS-LB or&#xD;
           P-LB. The investigators will compare outcomes such as pain, bleeding, hospitalization,&#xD;
           and tissue diagnosis between the two groups. This will allow us to add to the existing&#xD;
           data for the use of EUS-LB. If patients are found to have less adverse events and better&#xD;
           outcomes using EUS-LB versus percutaneous-LB this may become the preferred method of&#xD;
           diagnosis in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Background (briefly describe pre-clinical and clinical data, current experience with&#xD;
           procedures, drug or device, and any other relevant information to justify the research)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Several studies are emerging on the safety and efficacy of EUS-LB for diagnosis of&#xD;
           patients with liver disease, with only one prospective study.(2) Shah et al. published&#xD;
           in 2017 after retrospective review that EUS-LB is safe and efficacious in patients for&#xD;
           diagnostic evaluation.(3) Diehl et al. evaluated diagnostic yield of EUS-LB and safety&#xD;
           finding it to be successful and safe for obtaining adequate biopsies.(2) Nieto's team&#xD;
           looked retrospectively at EUS-LB using a specific needle and one pass method finding it&#xD;
           to be safe and effective with rare adverse events of abdominal pain and hematoma.(4)&#xD;
           Currently, there is a randomized clinical trial at Brigham and Women's Hospital&#xD;
           comparing safety and efficacy of EUS-LB vs. P-LB (ClinicalTrials.Gov NCT02947516).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Our advanced endoscopists, Drs. Hammoud and Samiullah, perform endoscopic ultrasounds&#xD;
           regularly for diagnostic and/or therapeutic reasons, as part of the routine standard of&#xD;
           care. Doctor Ghassan Hammoud has successfully performed EUS-LB procedures and will be&#xD;
           the sole endoscopist performing the EUS-LB for patients in this study. Many patients who&#xD;
           are undergoing endoscopic ultrasound exams are referred to the hepatologists at our&#xD;
           institution for evaluation of persistently abnormal hepatic enzymes in whom noninvasive&#xD;
           workup for liver diseases has failed to unfold the underlying etiology. As a result,&#xD;
           liver biopsy for further assessment and evaluation is strongly considered in this subset&#xD;
           of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Study Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study design, including the sequence and timing of study procedures (distinguish&#xD;
           research procedures from those that are part of routine care).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study duration and number of study visits required of research participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Blinding, including justification for blinding or not blinding the trial, if applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Justification of why participants will not receive routine care or will have current&#xD;
           therapy stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Justification for inclusion of a placebo or non-treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Definition of treatment failure or participant removal criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Description of what happens to participants receiving therapy when study ends or if a&#xD;
           participant's participation in the study ends prematurely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective randomized clinical trial comparing the safety and efficacy of EUS-LB&#xD;
      to P-LB. Patients who meet the inclusion criteria will be informed of their options with&#xD;
      respect to obtaining the liver biopsy. Patients will be informed of all the risks&#xD;
      (perforation, bleeding, infection, adverse effects related to peri-procedural medications,&#xD;
      etc.). Those in agreement will provide informed consent to use their de-identified data for&#xD;
      diagnosis and research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will run over a year period or up to when the target number of patients are&#xD;
      consented whichever comes first. Patients will only be required to visit for the EUS-LB&#xD;
      appointment as already scheduled for standard of care. The study will not be blinded to the&#xD;
      researchers; however personal identifiers will be removed as data is collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure details: patients will be screened preoperatively to assess cardiovascular health&#xD;
      prior to undergoing procedure as this is standard of care. Patients will follow all standard&#xD;
      preoperative instructions prior to anesthesia. Upon undergoing general anesthesia, a&#xD;
      videoendoscope will be introduced into the esophagus under direct vision. Once endoscope is&#xD;
      in position near the liver, a 19-gauge sharkcore needle will be used to puncture the left&#xD;
      lobe with a 3 accentuation and another pass from right lobe with 4 accentuation. Doppler&#xD;
      study will be used to interrogate for any significant doppler signals in needle path. Post&#xD;
      procedure, patients will be provided instructions to avoid NSAIDs for 4 days and perform&#xD;
      lightweight activity for 4 days. Patients will be observed for bleeding and significant&#xD;
      abdominal pain postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification of the clinical trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      EUS-LB has recently emerged as acceptable method to obtain liver tissue parenchyma for&#xD;
      diagnostic purposes in both children and adult with abnormal liver chemistries. Several&#xD;
      clinical studies have shown that obtaining liver tissue parenchyma by endoscopic&#xD;
      ultrasonography is safe and reliable, compared to the traditional method, i.e. percutaneous&#xD;
      approach.(2, 3, 5-14) In contrast to older methods (P-LB and TJ-LB), EUS-LB is targeted, with&#xD;
      the ability to obtain liver tissue parenchyma from both hepatic lobes. In addition, EUS-LB&#xD;
      can be combined with upper endoscopy as part of the evaluation for upper gastrointestinal&#xD;
      symptoms/clinical presentation, and to evaluate for portal hypertension in cirrhotic&#xD;
      patients. Moreover, a recent meta-analysis including 9 clinical studies reported an overall&#xD;
      93.6% histological diagnosis rate and a 2.3% adverse event rate with EUS-LB.(15) These&#xD;
      studies, however, were flawed by their retrospective nature (only one study was prospective),&#xD;
      variability in the demographics of patients undergoing EUS-LB, variability in the reported&#xD;
      primary and secondary outcomes, variability in the reporting of insufficiency of specimens,&#xD;
      variability in the core needle used, variability in the biopsy access route (trans-gastric&#xD;
      vs. trans-duodenal), and variability in the biopsy site (right and left lobes vs. right lobe&#xD;
      vs. left lobe). Our proposed clinical trial aims to examine the safety and efficacy of EUS-LB&#xD;
      vs. P-LB in a prospective fashion under more stringent conditions. It is our hope that this&#xD;
      prospective clinical trial will better define those who are ideal candidates for EUS-LB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Statistics n. Primary outcome variable. o. Secondary outcome variables. p. Statistical&#xD;
      plan including sample size justification and interim data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      q. Early stopping rules.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Main outcomes measures are to assess EUS-LB vs. P-LB outcomes such as bleeding, pain,&#xD;
           other complications after biopsies, tissue diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary outcome variable s will analyze demographic variables compared to outcomes and&#xD;
           method&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The investigators searched the literature and found only one prospective study comparing&#xD;
           the safety and efficacy of EUS-LB vs. P-LB. In that study, it is unclear how the sample&#xD;
           size was calculated. For the purposes of our proposed prospective clinical trial, our&#xD;
           primary outcome measure is the number of complete portal tract(s) obtained per liver&#xD;
           biopsy procedure. According to the most recent American Association for the Study of&#xD;
           Liver Diseases (AASLD), an adequate liver biopsy for pathological interpretation is&#xD;
           defined as a liver biopsy with ≥12 complete portal tracts. The investigators have&#xD;
           designed a table showing variability of sample size calculations based on the assumed %&#xD;
           of patients with ≥12 complete portal tracts in each group (i.e. EUS-LB vs. P-LB). For&#xD;
           this study, the sample size is calculated based on the assumption that 90% of patients&#xD;
           in the EUS-LB group will have liver biopsies with ≥12 complete portal tracts and 60% of&#xD;
           patients in the P-LB will have liver biopsies with ≥12 complete portal tracts. Assuming&#xD;
           a two-sided type I error of alpha (α)=0.05, at least 80% power, and a 1:1 ratio of&#xD;
           EUS-LB vs. P-LB group, the estimated sample size for this study is 38 patients per group&#xD;
           (total n= 76).&#xD;
