  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A single blinded randomized controlled trial. 212 subjects (teeth), 106 in each of the 2&#xD;
      groups will be recruited from the patients referred to Kuwait Board of Endodontics for&#xD;
      primary root canal treatment. The aim is to compare the outcome of single cone technique and&#xD;
      BC sealer with warm vertical compaction and AH+ sealer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative PA radiograph and CBCT will be taken. A 1 year follow up period will be arranged&#xD;
      and another PA radiograph and CBCT will be taken. The preoperative, postoperative and review&#xD;
      clinical and radiographic data will be analyzed&#xD;

      Aims and Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the clinical outcome of the SCCS with WVC in non-surgical root canal&#xD;
           treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the radiographic outcome of the SCCS with WVC in non-surgical root canal&#xD;
           treatment using periapical radiographs and CBCT scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the difference in postoperative pain between the 2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the difference in the time required to complete the obturation between the 2&#xD;
           groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who are referred to the Kuwait Board of Endodontics for non-surgical root canal&#xD;
           treatment and fulfil the inclusion/exclusion criteria of the study will be included&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre-operative periapical radiograph, CBCT scan and 11-point Numerical Rating Scale (NRS)&#xD;
           will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Upon completion of root canal instrumentation, the participants will be randomly&#xD;
           allocated to either Group A: obturation using SCCS or Group B: obturation using WVC. The&#xD;
           participants will be blinded to the type of treatment received and the clinician will&#xD;
           only be informed of the obturation method once the canal/canals are ready for&#xD;
           obturation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All teeth will then be restored definitively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The participants will be contacted via telephone 1, 3 and 7 days post-treatment to&#xD;
           report their NRS pain score.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The participants will be recalled after 1 year for clinical and radiographic assessment&#xD;
           using periapical radiograph and CBCT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The participants will then be followed-up annually for up to 4 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Statistical analysis will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The design of the study will conform to the CONSORT statement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical and Analytical Plans&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size estimation for the treatment outcome was performed using PASS 2019 computer&#xD;
      software, utilizing information from previous studies on healing outcome after initial&#xD;
      endodontic therapy. For a two independent-samples t-test of proportions, at power of 80% and&#xD;
      5% significance level for two-tailed test, detecting a 10% difference of healing rate&#xD;
      required a sample size of 148 teeth. Adjusting for a dropout rate of 30%, the required sample&#xD;
      size was 212 teeth. The slightly high 30% dropout rate is anticipated because most of the&#xD;
      patients we treat are non-Kuwaiti nationals and their presence in the country after 1 year is&#xD;
      not guaranteed.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Permuted block randomization (of block size = only known to statistician) will be used to randomly select 212 subjects (106 subjects in each group).

    <masking>Triple (Participant, Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>Participants will be blinded to the type of treatment they receive to reduce bias in the reporting of postoperative pain.&#xD;
Since it is not possible to blind the care providers, they will only be informed of the type of treatment once full chemo-mechanical debridement has been completed and the tooth is ready to be obturated. This would reduce care provider bias.&#xD;
Assessors will be blinded to the treatment option to reduce bias during the assessment of healing.</masking_description>
