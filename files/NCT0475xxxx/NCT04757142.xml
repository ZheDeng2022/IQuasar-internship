      Prospective, multicenter, observational cohort study to collect data on Chilean patients&#xD;
      diagnosed with Heart Failure with reduced ejection fraction, their treatments, and their&#xD;
      progress in a real-world environment. Additional objectives will be analyzed, such as&#xD;
      mortality, and the barriers, if any, to receiving the indicated treatment.&#xD;
