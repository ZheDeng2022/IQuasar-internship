  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the effect of selpercatinib given before surgery in treating&#xD;
      patients with thyroid cancer whose tumors have RET alterations (changes in the genetic&#xD;
      material [deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)]). Selpercatinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by&#xD;
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving selpercatinib before surgery may&#xD;
      help shrink the tumors and help control the disease.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the efficacy of neoadjuvant selpercatinib in medullary thyroid cancer by&#xD;
      objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST (standard Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid&#xD;
      Tumors [RECIST]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the efficacy of neoadjuvant selpercatinib in medullary thyroid cancer by ORR&#xD;
      per modified neck RECIST.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the efficacy of neoadjuvant selpercatinib in medullary thyroid cancer per&#xD;
      surgical margin status, which is categorized as R0, R1, and R2 surgical resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the safety profile of neoadjuvant selpercatinib. IV. To evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy of neoadjuvant selpercatinib on progression-free survival (PFS), including overall&#xD;
      PFS and locoregional PFS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To measure changes in expected and actual surgical morbidity/complexity as well as&#xD;
      evaluate changes of R0/R1 resection rates in pre-specified extrathyroidal anatomic target&#xD;
      interfaces before and after selpercatinib treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. In patients with differentiated thyroid cancer [DTC] and anaplastic thyroid cancer [ATC]&#xD;
      only, to evaluate the efficacy of neoadjuvant selpercatinib by ORR per RECIST (standard&#xD;
      RECIST and modified neck RECIST), surgical margin status (R0/R1 versus [vs.] R2), safety&#xD;
      profile, surgical morbidity/complexity, PFS and overall survival (overall survival [OS], ATC&#xD;
      only).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To define and measure changes of patient-reported outcomes and quality of life as&#xD;
      measured by MD Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI) and European Quality of Life Five Dimension&#xD;
      (EQ-5D) in patients with RET-altered thyroid cancer who receive selpercatinib treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To explore translational endpoints in selpercatinib neoadjuvant therapy with&#xD;
      biopsies/tissue collection before selpercatinib treatment and during surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To explore peripheral and tissue measures associated with selpercatinib mechanisms of&#xD;
      resistance in patients who experience disease progression after selpercatinib treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive selpercatinb orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Treatment repeats&#xD;
      every 28 days for up to 7 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity. Patients then undergo standard of care surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for disease progression status&#xD;
      every 3-4 months for the first 2 years. ATC patients continue follow-up every 6 months for&#xD;
      year 3 and 4, and once in year 5.&#xD;
