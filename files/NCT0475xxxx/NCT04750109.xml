  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with Carcinoma of Unknown Primary (CUP) have widespread cancer at diagnosis however&#xD;
      the specific site of origin cannot be found, despite significant testing, making it difficult&#xD;
      to treat. CUP has a poor prognosis; it is the 6th most common cause of cancer death in the&#xD;
      UK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date there have been limited studies investigating molecular genomics in CUP patients,&#xD;
      resulting in limited evidence to evaluate whether genomic profiling has added value over and&#xD;
      above the standard diagnostics provided in the NHS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a result, our project will aim to;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess genomic sequencing (both in tissue and blood) for the diagnosis and treatment&#xD;
           guidance in CUP patients including a comparison of the effectiveness of tissue and blood&#xD;
           based biomarkers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collect evidence to further develop technology that predicts an individual's response to&#xD;
           a treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Develop innovative systems of clinical data capture in patients with CUP&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigate novel biomarkers to determine the primary tumour location Approximately&#xD;
           120-140 CUP patients will be recruited across 7 UK NHS sites. Tumour samples will be&#xD;
           collected from patients undergoing a standard of care procedure OR medically fit&#xD;
           patients with accessible tumour. Archival tumour may also be obtained. Some samples will&#xD;
           be stored for future translational research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sequencing results alongside clinical data will be discussed by a multi-disciplinary CUP&#xD;
      Molecular Tumour Board. They will provide oversight on the nature, clinical significance and&#xD;
      relevance of the results. They will inform the local CUP team of any &quot;actionable&quot; genetic&#xD;
      changes, which could potentially direct selection of a targeted therapy trial for that&#xD;
      patient. Sequential blood samples will be collected to investigate genetic characteristics&#xD;
      that may be able to predict response to therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aggregated anonymised data will be made publicly available following completion of this&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;

        All study participants must have a histological confirmed diagnosis of CUP based on the&#xD;
        clinical, radiological and pathological review at a local or regional CUP MDT and the 2015&#xD;
        ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines for CUP(Fizazi et al., 2015). Favourable and&#xD;
        unfavourable-risk CUP subsets are eligible. The population to be included in this study&#xD;
        corresponds to patients with CUP of epithelial origin for whom a likely tissue of origin&#xD;
        cannot be determined.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Bleeding diathesis (patients' on anticoagulation are permitted to enter the trial if&#xD;
