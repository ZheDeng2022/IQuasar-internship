  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic disease self-management interventions and meditative movement approaches (.e.g.,&#xD;
      yoga) can independently improve depressive symptoms. However, to our knowledge there are no&#xD;
      interventions integrating evidence-based chronic disease management strategies with yoga to&#xD;
      maximize physical, psychological or social outcomes, nor are mobile health platforms commonly&#xD;
      used to improve the reach of these integrated interventions. Therefore, we developed&#xD;
      Merging-Yoga for Self-Management Skills Mobile (MY-Skills Mobile). Our first aim is to adapt&#xD;
      the MY-Skills Mobile to tailor the intervention to older adults with multiple chronic&#xD;
      conditions (MCC) by convening a panel of patient and care-partner stakeholders. We will&#xD;
      convene four patient and care-partner dyads (N=8) to serve as study partners for three&#xD;
      longitudinal focus groups to suggest and review MY-Skills Mobile adaptations. We will then&#xD;
      conduct a usability study of MY-Skills Mobile with older adults with MCC and their&#xD;
      care-partners. We will conduct two waves of rapid-cycle prototyping with 5 dyads in each wave&#xD;
      (N=20). Dyads will participate in MY-Skills Mobile modules. We will then use acceptability&#xD;
      surveys and use data in each wave to iteratively adapt MY-Skills Mobile to optimize usability&#xD;
      and acceptability.&#xD;

    <description>MY-Skills Mobile is an 8-week intervention merging yoga and self-management offered via remote tools including Zoom (video-conferencing software), Canvas (education software), and Qualtrics (survey software) that can be accessed via a computer or tablet. The self-management content is delivered primarily through asynchronous tools that include educational videos and interactive activities for goal setting, action plan, monitoring goals, and problem-solving practice. Yoga is offered synchronously via Zoom two-times per week for 60 minutes (120 minutes per week). The synchronous yoga sessions will be offered at a time that best accommodates participants' schedules. Yoga will become progressively challenging over the eight weeks and will include seated and standing postures.</description>
