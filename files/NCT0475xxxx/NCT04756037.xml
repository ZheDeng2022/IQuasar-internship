      This is a single-arm, open-label, phase 3 study to assess the contraceptive efficacy of&#xD;
      relugolix combination therapy (relugolix 40 milligrams [mg], estradiol [E2] 1 mg, and&#xD;
      norethindrone acetate [NETA] 0.5 mg).&#xD;

    <measure>Contraceptive Efficacy of Relugolix Combination Therapy as Assessed by the At-Risk Pearl Index (PI)</measure>
    <time_frame>13 consecutive 28-day treatment cycles</time_frame>
    <description>The At-Risk PI is defined as the number of on treatment pregnancies per 100 women-years of treatment. The At-Risk PI will be calculated on the basis of cycles considered at-risk of pregnancy, that is, consecutive 28-day periods without use of any other contraceptive methods and with affirmed occurrence of vaginal intercourse. On-treatment pregnancies are pregnancies with an estimated conception date between the first day of study intervention intake up to and including 7 days after the last intake of study medication.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Contraceptive Efficacy of Relugolix Combination Therapy as Assessed by the Modified At-Risk PI</measure>
    <time_frame>13 consecutive 28-day treatment cycles</time_frame>
    <description>The Modified At-Risk PI is based on the number of on-treatment pregnancies occurring during cycles without any other contraceptive methods, regardless of occurrence of vaginal intercourse. On-treatment pregnancies are pregnancies with an estimated conception date between the first day of study intervention intake up to and including 7 days after the last intake of study medication.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Contraceptive Efficacy of Relugolix Combination Therapy as Assessed by the Gross PI</measure>
    <time_frame>13 consecutive 28-day treatment cycles</time_frame>
    <description>The &quot;typical use&quot; contraceptive efficacy will be assessed using the Gross PI, based on the number of on-treatment pregnancies occurring during all cycles regardless of the use of other contraceptive methods, confirmed vaginal intercourse, or protocol compliance. On-treatment pregnancies are pregnancies with an estimated conception date between the first day of study intervention intake up to and including 7 days after the last intake of study medication.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Contraceptive Efficacy of Relugolix Combination Therapy as Assessed by the Method Failure PI</measure>
    <time_frame>13 consecutive 28-day treatment cycles</time_frame>
    <description>The &quot;perfect use&quot; contraceptive efficacy will be assessed using the Method Failure PI, based on the number of on-treatment pregnancies occurring during cycles that are at risk and without major protocol deviations. On-treatment pregnancies are pregnancies with an estimated conception date between the first day of study intervention intake up to and including 7 days after the last intake of study medication.</description>

    <description>The percent change in bone mineral density will be measured from baseline and 12-months on-treatment (or End-of-Treatment) to 6- and 12-months post-treatment at the lumbar spine (L1-L4), total hip, and femoral neck.</description>
