  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is to find out the possible side effects of pembrolizumab and radiation&#xD;
      therapy before and during surgery in treating patients with head and neck squamous cell&#xD;
      cancer that remains despite treatment (persistent) or has come back (recurrent).&#xD;
      Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune&#xD;
      system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and&#xD;
      spread. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays or protons to kill tumor cells and shrink&#xD;
      tumors. Giving pembrolizumab and radiation therapy before and during surgery may kill more&#xD;
      tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the potential toxicity of immunotherapy and preoperative radiation combined&#xD;
      with intra-operative radiation in patients with recurrent or persistent head and neck&#xD;
      squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the clinical efficacy, measured as a locoregional control rate (LCR) and&#xD;
      progression-free survival (PFS), of immunotherapy and preoperative radiation combined with&#xD;
      intra-operative radiation in patients with recurrent or persistent HNSCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the pre-operative radiation dose effect (0 Gy, 2 Gy X 2, 8 Gy X 2) on&#xD;
      anti-tumor immune response in the setting of immunotherapy in patients with recurrent or&#xD;
      persistent HNSCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the radiation dose effect (0 Gy, 2 Gy X 2, 8 Gy X 2) on the expression of&#xD;
      the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) exonuclease Trex1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To compare the overall survival (OS) of pembrolizumab and pre-operative external beam&#xD;
      radiation therapy (EBRT) plus intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) in subjects with&#xD;
      recurrent or persistent HNSCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To assess the overall safety and tolerability of pembrolizumab and pre-operative EBRT and&#xD;
      IORT plus post-operative pembrolizumab versus pre-operative pembrolizumab plus IORT and&#xD;
      post-operative pembrolizumab in subjects with with recurrent or persistent HNSCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To evaluate whether PD-L1 expression is a predictive biomarker for LCR and PFS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To evaluate whether TNF-alpha expression is a predictive biomarker for LCR and PFS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. To evaluate whether NFkappaB expression is a predictive biomarker for LCR and PFS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IX. To evaluate whether tumor mutational burden is predictive of immunotherapy response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      X. To evaluate the Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) as assessed by European&#xD;
      Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire -&#xD;
      Core 30 (QLQ-C30).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate associations between gene expression status of tumor samples and clinical&#xD;
      efficacy (LRC, PFS and overall survival [OS]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate whether mutational burden is a predictive biomarker for LCR and PFS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To explore potential biomarkers associated with clinical efficacy (LRC, PFS, and OS) by&#xD;
      analyzing circulating tumor DNA quantitative load with polymerase chain reaction (PCR),&#xD;
      chemokines/cytokines and immune cells (e.g. CD8+ T cells, regulatory T cells [Tregs], myeloid&#xD;
      derived suppressor cells [MDSCs]) with FACS in blood, tumor tissue and correlating those with&#xD;
      clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A: Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) on day 1 of week 1, and undergo&#xD;
      salvage surgery during week 4. Beginning week 8, patients receive pembrolizumab IV every 3&#xD;
      weeks for up to 18 doses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
      Patients also undergo intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) for 1 fraction during week 9.&#xD;
      Treatment with pembrolizumab may continue beyond initial progression per&#xD;
      investigator-assessed clinical benefit and if the patient is tolerating pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B: Patients receive pembrolizumab IV on day 1 of week 1, and undergo low dose EBRT for 2&#xD;
      fractions on 2 consecutive days during week 4. Patients also undergo salvage surgery during&#xD;
      week 8. Beginning week 11, patients receive pembrolizumab IV every 3 weeks for up to 18 doses&#xD;
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo IORT&#xD;
      for 1 fraction during week 11. Treatment with pembrolizumab may continue beyond initial&#xD;
      progression per investigator-assessed clinical benefit and if the patient is tolerating&#xD;
      pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM C: Patients receive pembrolizumab IV on day 1 of week 1, and undergo high dose EBRT for 2&#xD;
      fractions on 2 consecutive days during week 4. Patients also undergo salvage surgery during&#xD;
      week 8. Beginning week 11, patients receive pembrolizumab IV every 3 weeks for up to 18 doses&#xD;
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo IORT&#xD;
      for 1 fraction during week 11. Treatment with pembrolizumab may continue beyond initial&#xD;
      progression per investigator-assessed clinical benefit and if the patient is tolerating&#xD;
      pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 90 and 180 days, then every&#xD;
      90 weeks for 24 months, and then every 6 months up to year 5.&#xD;
