  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind 3-way crossover study in which&#xD;
      PUR1800, or placebo is dosed daily for 14 consecutive days in adult subjects with stable COPD&#xD;
      over three discrete TPs. Subjects will be randomised to one of the following 3 treatment&#xD;
      sequences:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sequence Period 1 Period 2 Period 3&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Placebo PUR1800 250 μg PUR1800 500 μg&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. PUR1800 250 μg Placebo PUR1800 500 μg&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. PUR1800 250 μg PUR1800 500 μg Placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since this is the first study in humans in which the iSPERSE formulation is being&#xD;
      administered, the 3 treatment sequences are designed in order to ensure that the lower dose&#xD;
      of PUR1800 (250 μg) is administered prior to the administration of the higher dose of PUR1800&#xD;
      (500 μg).&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study design is as follows&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed Consent: Before any study specific procedures are conducted or study requirements&#xD;
      are expected of a patient, the patient must review and sign an IEC-approved informed consent&#xD;
      form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening: Subjects will be screened for eligibility to participate in the study within 28&#xD;
      days before randomisation (i.e. TP1, Day 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Periods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Period 1: On Day 1 all subjects who are eligible for entry into the study will be randomised&#xD;
      to 1 of 3 treatment sequences and receive either placebo or the lowest nominal dose of&#xD;
      PUR1800 (PUR1800 250 μg) for 14 consecutive days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Period 2: Following a washout period of at least 28 days after the completion of Period 1&#xD;
      dosing, subjects will receive a treatment other than what the subject received during Period&#xD;
      1 for 14 consecutive days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Period 3: Following a washout period of at least 28 days after the completion of Period 2&#xD;
      dosing, subjects will receive the treatment that the subject had not received during Periods&#xD;
      1 or 2 (either placebo or PUR1800, 500 μg) for 14 consecutive days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of Study (EOS): Subjects will return to the study site 28 days after the last dose of the&#xD;
      last TP (or in the event of early withdrawal after the last dose received, if possible) for&#xD;
      an EOS visit. Unscheduled visits are permitted at the discretion of the investigator.&#xD;

    <masking_description>A computerised randomisation scheme will be created and shall be considered blinded. The randomisation is available only to the clinical research unit pharmacy staff that are preparing the drug who will not be involved in any other aspect of the study including administration of the drug. It will not be made available to the subjects, site(s) PI(s), or members of the staff responsible for the monitoring and evaluation of safety assessments. PUR1800 and placebo capsules will be of the same shape, size, and color to ensure that the blind is maintained. A subject's treatment assignment will only be unblinded when knowledge of the treatment is essential for the further clinical management of the subject on this study or may potentially impact the safety of subjects currently enrolled or subjects in subsequent enrollment.</masking_description>
