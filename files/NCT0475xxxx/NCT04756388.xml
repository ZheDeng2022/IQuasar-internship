  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Executive Function Training is a cognitive training approach that specifically trains&#xD;
      executive functioning for people with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders. The current study&#xD;
      compares full executive function training to computerized training alone and to strategy&#xD;
      monitoring alone.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All interventions will involve 4 weeks of group treatment consisting of two 1-hour group&#xD;
      sessions per week and additional practice at home between sessions. The Executive Training&#xD;
      condition will consist of 50% of the session practicing computerized cognitive training&#xD;
      exercises, and 50% of the session developing cognitive strategies to use in the computerized&#xD;
      exercises. Participants are encouraged to complete 40 minutes of computerized training per&#xD;
      day, and complete strategy worksheets, at home between sessions. In Computerized Cognitive&#xD;
      Training only participants will spend the entire one-hour session practicing computerized&#xD;
      training exercises. Between sessions participants will be encouraged to practice the&#xD;
      computerized exercises at home for 40 minutes per day. There will be no strategy development&#xD;
      in this condition. In Strategy Development only participants will engage in cognitive&#xD;
      strategy discussions to develop new executive function strategies that can be used in daily&#xD;
      life. Between sessions, participants will be encouraged to practice their cognitive&#xD;
      strategies in their daily life and track their strategies using the strategy worksheet. There&#xD;
      will be no computerized cognitive training in this condition. All interventions will be&#xD;
      delivered virtually in the participant's home and group sessions will be conducted using the&#xD;
      online platform Zoom.&#xD;
&#xD;
      90 participants with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders will be recruited. Power analyses,&#xD;
      conducted with GPower, indicate that 90 participants (30 per treatment condition), accounting&#xD;
      for an upper limit of 25% attrition observed in my previous trials of ET, provides 80% power&#xD;
      to detect a medium effect size (cohen's f = 0.2) difference between conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary and secondary outcomes will be examined using Linear Mixed Models on the&#xD;
      Intent-to-Treat sample with missing data interpolated using maximum likelihood estimation.&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is the 3-month follow-up assessment, and secondary endpoint of&#xD;
      post-treatment will also be examined.&#xD;
