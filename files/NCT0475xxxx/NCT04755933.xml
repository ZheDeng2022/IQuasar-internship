  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised controlled trial of an intervention to reduce symptoms of anxiety in the&#xD;
      children of anxious parents. Parents will participate in an online intervention which helps&#xD;
      them develop a calm, consistent, behaviour management style. The parents will be randomised&#xD;
      to the intervention or a control group with no intervention. The intervention itself will&#xD;
      undergo a component analysis to determine whether some modules are more effective than&#xD;
      others.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is an online course (derived from an existing evidence-based face-to-face workshop&#xD;
      designed and evaluated by the C.I) which aims to reduce symptoms of anxiety in the children&#xD;
      of anxious parents. It is a learning tool to help parents to understand the basic processes&#xD;
      involved in children's anxiety, to develop a calm, consistent, behaviour management style and&#xD;
      to learn skills for responding to difficult emotion in their children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The whole study takes place online, allowing the participants to sign up, run through some&#xD;
      brief eligibility questions, read the study information and provide consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once enrolled in the study, there is a series of baseline questionnaires. The participant&#xD;
      also has the option to nominate someone who also knows their child well (e.g. a co-parent, a&#xD;
      family member or close friend) to participate in the study with them and to complete a small&#xD;
      number of questionnaires. This will help to give us a broader, more objective picture of the&#xD;
      child, but is an optional part of the study. 48 hours later (to allow time for the&#xD;
      participants to contact the co-respondent if they choose) the index participant will be&#xD;
      randomised to one of two groups: either the intervention (the online course), or the control&#xD;
      group where they do not receive the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those in the intervention will be randomised to receive 8 out of 9 modules of the course,&#xD;
      with a suggested time frame of one or two modules a week, each module taking about 30&#xD;
      minutes, with some home-practice tasks in-between.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both the intervention group and the control group participants will be contacted again after&#xD;
      6 months to complete a set of follow-up questionnaires (similar to those completed at&#xD;
      baseline). Depending on when each participant joins the trial, they may be contacted a third&#xD;
      time towards the end of the life of the study, to complete another set of questionnaires,9-21&#xD;
      months after their first.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in child anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months, and up to 21 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Measured using the Spence Children's Anxiety Scale (SCAS-P and Preschool SCAS if the child is aged 6 or under).&#xD;
SCAS-P: Minimum 0 Maximum 114. A higher total score is indicative of higher level of child anxiety. T scores used to indicate clinical levels of anxiety however this is a screen not a diagnostic instrument.&#xD;
SCAS Preschool: Minimum 0 Maximum 112. A higher total indicates a higher level of pre-school child anxiety. A score of 1SD above the mean for a subscale or the total score indicates clinical investigated would be warranted.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months, and up to 21 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Measured using Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorder (SCARED-A): Minimum 0, Maximum 142. . Higher total score (&gt;30) predictive of a current anxiety disorder. Higher subscale scores associated with elevated anxiety symptoms of clinically defines anxiety disorders.</description>

Scores predictive of psychopathology at following levels: Internalizing score positive if ≥ 5 PSC-17 Externalizing score positive if ≥ 7 PSC-17 Attention score positive if ≥7 PSC-17 Total score positive if ≥15.</description>

    <measure>Change in anxiogenic parenting behaviours</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months, and up to 21 months</time_frame>
    <description>Measure using Comprehensive Parenting Behaviour Questionnaire (CPBQ). Minimum 104. Maximum 520. The scale is split into broad dimensions, subscales and sub subscales. Higher scores are associated with greater level of parenting behaviour under investigation in the given subscale: both positive (e.g. warmth) and challenging (e.g. overprotection).</description>

    <measure>Change in anxiogenic parenting behaviours</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months, and up to 21 months</time_frame>
    <description>Measured using a parenting experience scale (constructed specifically for this study, divided into 8 modules).&#xD;
Core: Min 1 Max 5. Higher score = Positive. Module A: Min 1 Max 5. Higher score = Positive (Q2: R scored). Module B: Min 1 Max 5. Higher score = Positive (all are R scored). Module C: Min 1 Max 5. Higher score = Positive. Module D: Q1, Q3, Q4: Min 1 Max 5. Higher score = Positive (Q4: R scored). Module D Q2: Min 1 Max 5. Higher score = Positive. Module E: Min 1 Max 4. Higher score = Negative (Q3: R scored). Module F: Min 1 Max 5. Higher score = Positive (Q1 and Q4: R scored). Module G Q1: Min 1 Max 5. Higher score = Positive (Q1: R scored). Module GQ2: Min 3 Max 5: Higher score Negative (Note: Both ends of the scale are maladaptive). Module G Q3: Min 1 Max 5. Higher score = Negative.</description>
