      This research will be a continuation of 2015-2017 research projects of smart phone APP&#xD;
      research granted by Ministry of Science and Technology. First of all, a&#xD;
      four-wave-cross-sectional survey by cluster sampling is used to recruit 90 adolescents aged&#xD;
      13-19 from high school, vocational schools or colleges to test the feasibility of the health&#xD;
      literacy-based weight-control program. In the second stage, a two-arm randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial (RCT) will be applied to recruit 240 overweight or obese teenagers to receive health&#xD;
      literacy-based mobile Health App, smart sports watch Fitbit versa during the 12 months weight&#xD;
      control program. Based on the previous research evidences, the outcome follow up will be&#xD;
      scheduled on 3 months, 9 months, 15 months, and 21 months after the mobile Health Apps&#xD;
      intervention. Short-term outcome indicators include health literacy, diet pattern, and&#xD;
      dietary behaviors; long-term outcome indicators include BMI z-score, waist circumference.&#xD;
      Intention-to-treat analysis, generalized linear mixed models with repeated measures, multiple&#xD;
      regression analysis model, and counterfactual causal Inference will be applied to analyze the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the interventions.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Adolescent overweight and obesity are major health issues and challenges worldwide. According&#xD;
      to the estimate of World Health Organization, the number of obese people in the world has&#xD;
      tripled since 1975. Overweight and obese children and adolescents increased from 124 million&#xD;
      in 1975 to 340 million in 2016. The obese young children will have a negative impact on the&#xD;
      physical, psychological and social health, and will increase the risk of obesity in&#xD;
      adulthood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a continuing project of the research funded by the Ministry of Science and&#xD;
      Technology to explore the smartphone app, health literacy. Purposes of this study are to (1)&#xD;
      validate the Health literacy based mobile Health Apps Interventions, (2) conduct the mobile&#xD;
      health apps and smart sports watches to intervene in 12 months and evaluate the effectiveness&#xD;
      by follow-up repeated measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility criteria. The inclusion criteria are 13-19 years old adolescents; Could use their&#xD;
      mobile phones to upload diet records and photos; and Adolescents and their parents agree to&#xD;
      involve in the study and sign the consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion conditions are the adolescent who with severe diseases (such as tumors and other&#xD;
      diseases); and they already participate in other weight control program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods This research will be a continuation of 2015-2017 research projects of smart phone&#xD;
      APP research granted by Ministry of Science and Technology. First of all, a&#xD;
      four-wave-cross-sectional survey by cluster sampling is used to recruit 90 adolescents aged&#xD;
      13-19 from high school, vocational schools or colleges to test the feasibility of the health&#xD;

      effectiveness of the interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected outcomes This study applies health literacy-based mobile Health Apps weight control&#xD;
      program for the overweight and obese adolescents. By strengthening healthy lifestyle of&#xD;
      healthy dietary pattern and physical activity for adolescents, we hope to effectively prevent&#xD;
      adolescent obesity, so as to reduce the impacts of obesity to social, medical and economic&#xD;
      burdens.&#xD;
