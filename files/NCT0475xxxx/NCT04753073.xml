  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the prospective, unicenter proof-of-principle study is to investigate the&#xD;
      anti-neoplastic effectiveness of NIPP against CIN III lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The aim of this project is to evaluate the potential of a previous NIPP treatment to&#xD;
           significantly reduce the invasiveness of the LEEP excision.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Another aim of this study is to investigate cellular / molecular effects of NIPP&#xD;
           following the in-vivo treatment of the cervix using molecular biological methods. For&#xD;
           this purpose, tissue treated with plasma is taken after defined periods of time by mini&#xD;
           biopsy and examined using molecular biological, histological and microscopic methods.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cervical intraepithelial neoplasms (CIN), classified into severity levels CIN I to III, can&#xD;
      be precursors to cervical cancer (CC), the world's third most common cancer in women (270,000&#xD;
      deaths / year), which radical therapies are often associated with lifelong severe physical&#xD;
      and emotional stress. Cross-sectional studies found a prevalence for CIN of 62 per 1,000&#xD;
      women and incidences of 1.2 (CIN I), 0.8 (CIN II) and 0.7 (CIN III) per 1,000 women per year&#xD;
      (highest incidence of CIN between 20 and 24 years) age). The standard therapy for the&#xD;
      treatment of CIN III by LEEP excision is associated with an increase in mortality of 17%. CIN&#xD;
      III, in particular, is associated with a significant decline in quality of life,&#xD;
      psychological well-being and sexual health, although on average only about 12% of CIN III&#xD;
      lesions progress to invasive CC. The resulting over-treatment (in around 8-9 out of 10&#xD;
      patients) with invasive procedures is a serious problem for affected women, health care&#xD;
      providers and the health economy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NIPP treatment is a tissue-sparing, pain-free, easy to carry out and outpatient treatment&#xD;
      method without anesthesia and hospitalization. A non-randomized, one-arm feasibility study at&#xD;
      the Department of Women's Health (649 / 2017BO1) already showed the effectiveness of a NIPP&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical implications for CIN III:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A previous NIPP treatment should significantly reduce the invasiveness of the LEEP&#xD;
           excision.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the oncological safety of NIPP treatment is comparable (histological complete&#xD;
           remission of CIN III), NIPP is to be established as a safe alternative to LEEP excision&#xD;
           in the future.&#xD;
