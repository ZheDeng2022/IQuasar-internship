      To investigate the efficacy of dydrogesterone 30 mg compared to micronized vaginal&#xD;
      progesterone 800 mg daily for luteal phase support in hormone replacement therapy frozen&#xD;
      embryo transfer cycles, as confirmed by visualization of fetal heart activity by pelvic&#xD;
      ultrasound assessment of ongoing pregnancy at 12 weeks of gestation.&#xD;

      A randomized controlled trial comparing dydrogesterone 30 mg versus micronized vaginal&#xD;
      progesterone 800 mg daily for luteal phase support in hormone replacement therapy frozen&#xD;
      embryo transfer cycles. Patients will undergo an embryo transfer in a hormone replacement&#xD;
      therapy cycle using Progynova 2 mg three times daily until an endometrium thickness of at&#xD;
      least 7 mm is reached. Afterwards two different luteal phase supplementation methods will be&#xD;
      compared. The primary outcome of the study is ongoing pregnancy at 12 weeks of gestation. We&#xD;
      will also investigate other prenatal and neonatal outcome factors as well as patients&#xD;
      satisfaction and safety of dydrogesterone.&#xD;

Adverse events will be considered as unexpected if the nature, seriousness, severity or outcome of the reaction(s) is not consistent with the reference information. The expectedness of adverse events for the medications used in this study is detailed in the reference safety information in the current summary of product characteristics (SmPCs) issued in the participating countries.&#xD;
All serieus suspected unexpected serious adverse drug reactions (SUSARs) will be subject to expedited reporting. The investigator is responsible for submitting reports of SUSARs to the appropriate national regulatory authorities within the required reporting period. The investigator is responsible for notifying the IECs/IRBs in writing of the SUSARs within the required reporting timelines. Copies of the notification will be maintained by the investigator in the study documentation files.</description>
