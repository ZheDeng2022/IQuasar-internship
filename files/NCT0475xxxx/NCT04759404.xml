    <textblock>
      In our study, it was aimed to investigate the effects of deep oscillation and myofascial&#xD;
      release on pain, functionality and quality of life in individuals with chronic nonspecific&#xD;
      low back pain. 72 individuals who voluntarily agree to participate in the study will be&#xD;
      included. Participants will be randomly divided into three groups, the deep oscillation&#xD;
      group, myofascial release and the control group. Home exercises including stretching and&#xD;
      strengthening for waist, back and abdominals will be given to all groups. However, in&#xD;
      addition to the deep oscillation group, deep oscillation will be applied to the lumbar region&#xD;
      and myofascial relaxation will be applied to the lumbar region for the myofascial group.&#xD;
      Individuals will be asked to come to the center where the research will be conducted for a&#xD;
      total of six sessions for two weeks, three times a week. Participants' pain will be evaluated&#xD;
      with visual analog scale and McGill Melzack Pain Questionnaire, disability status with&#xD;
      Oswestry Disability Index, sleep quality with Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and quality of&#xD;
      life with Short Form-36 before and after the first treatment in the first treatment.&#xD;
      Statistical analysis to be used in our research will be done with the Statistical Package for&#xD;
      the Social Sciences 20.0 package program.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to the data determined by the World Health Organization (WHO), one of the diseases&#xD;
      that 80% of people encounter throughout their lives is low back pain. Nonspecific low back&#xD;
      pain is defined as low back pain of unknown cause, which can be diagnosed, and cannot be&#xD;
      attributed to a known specific disease (eg infection, structural deformity, inflammatory&#xD;
      disorder, tumor, osteoporosis, fracture, radicular syndrome or cauda equina syndrome).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, low back pain problem is divided into three groups according to the duration of&#xD;
      the pain as acute (&lt;6 weeks), subacute (6-12 weeks) and chronic (&gt; 12 weeks) low back pain.&#xD;
      Chronic low back pain, which constitutes one third of all back problems, is known as moderate&#xD;
      back pain that lasts more than 12 weeks and continues one year after the onset of acute pain.&#xD;
      A definite etiological factor can be defined in only 15% of low back pain. It is known that&#xD;
      individuals' sociodemographic characteristics, psychosocial factors, occupational factors,&#xD;
      erroneous posture postures and recurrent microtraumas can cause back pain. In addition to&#xD;
      these, when looking at the studies conducted, it is seen that spasm in lumbar muscles, loss&#xD;
      of flexibility and increase in lumbal lordosis cause low back pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low back pain can be treated with pharmacological and non-pharmacological methods.&#xD;
      Non-pharmacological methods include various treatments such as physiotherapy, psychological&#xD;
      therapy and acupuncture; Pharmacological treatment methods include anti-inflammatory drugs,&#xD;
      opioids and antidepressants. It is suggested that pharmacological treatment methods have a&#xD;
      short-term effect on low back pain and create a placebo effect in individuals. Studies have&#xD;
      shown that physiotherapy programs that include treatment methods such as exercise, Tai Chi,&#xD;
      yoga, acupuncture, pilates, core stabilization exercises, Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve&#xD;
      Stabilization (TENS) are effective in reducing muscular spasm and pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Myofascial release is a manual treatment method that involves low pressure, long-term&#xD;
      stretching of the soft tissue in the painful area to restore the normal length of the facial&#xD;
      tissue, reduce pain and increase functionality. It has been shown that myofascial relaxation&#xD;
      therapy, which is applied in musculoskeletal disorders and observed to provide relaxation by&#xD;
      stimulating the neuromuscular system, has been shown to reduce back pain and increase the&#xD;
      flexibility of the lumbar muscles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deep oscillation therapy, which increases tissue nutrition and has an anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      effect as a result of electrostatic currents that cause a gentle and deep effective&#xD;
      fluctuation in the tissue, provides a positive effect on pain reduction and also on muscle&#xD;
      relaxation. In deep oscillation treatment, the body tissue of the individual is used as an&#xD;
      electrode, while the probe used by the physiotherapist for the area to be applied is used as&#xD;
      another electrode. Although there are no studies determining the effects of deep oscillation&#xD;
      therapy on the lumbar region muscles, it was seen that deep oscillation application had an&#xD;
      acute effect on muscle relaxation in the comparison of deep oscillation and ultrasound&#xD;
      treatments performed due to the decrease in the flexibility of the hamstring muscles.&#xD;

    <description>Individuals in the deep oscillation group will be treated by the researcher. During the application, individuals will be positioned face down on the stretcher. After the powder is applied to the lumbar region, deep oscillation treatment with a frequency of 80% -100% with a frequency of 150 Hz for the first 10 minutes and 60 Hz for 5 minutes will be applied with the Physiomed Deep Oscilation device. Each individual will be given a home exercise program (stretching and strengthening for waist, back and abdominal) consisting of stretching and strengthening. Individuals will be asked to come to the center where the research will take place, for a total of six sessions for two weeks, three times a week.</description>
