      The purpose of the study is to assess the safety and efficacy of increasing doses of IPN10200&#xD;
      with the aim to evaluate the Pharmacodynamics (PD) profile of IPN10200 and to establish the&#xD;
      total IPN10200 doses(s) that offer the best efficacy/safety profile when used for the&#xD;
      treatment of Adult upper limb (AUL) spasticity.&#xD;

             cancer cachexia, sarcopenia or other disorder that could interfere with neuromuscular&#xD;
             function), laboratory finding or circumstance that, in the judgment of the&#xD;
             investigator, might increase the risk to the participant or decrease the chance of&#xD;
             obtaining satisfactory data to achieve the objectives of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Pregnant or lactating women, or women of childbearing potential not willing to&#xD;
