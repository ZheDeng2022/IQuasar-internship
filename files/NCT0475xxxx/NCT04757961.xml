  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare the efficacy of LifeStories on depression symptomatology compared&#xD;
      to antidepressant treatment alone, in addition to examining the effect of the intervention on&#xD;
      health-related quality of life. Participants will be randomly assigned to either an online&#xD;
      ACT-based narrative intervention (Lifestories) or the waitlist control condition&#xD;
      (antidepressant treatment alone). It is hypothesized that participants who receive the&#xD;
      LifeStories will result in decreased depression and increased quality of life, general&#xD;
      functioning and decreased psychological inflexibility compared to the waitlist group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy of an online, self-guided ACT-based&#xD;
      narrative intervention for adults currently taking antidepressant medication. To test the&#xD;
      effects of LifeStories on depression severity, quality of life, general functioning and&#xD;
      psychological inflexibility, the investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      with two conditions (LifeStories and waitlist control) using a sample of 150 adults currently&#xD;
      taking antidepressant medication. Interested individuals will complete a screening survey to&#xD;
      determine eligibility. After being informed about the study and potential risks, eligible&#xD;
      participants who provide informed consent will be asked to complete a baseline survey.&#xD;
      Participants will then be randomized to LifeStories or a waitlist control conditions, each&#xD;
      lasting 4 weeks. Those in the waitlist group will be asked to not use other self-help&#xD;
      websites or books for four weeks, after which they will be given weekly access to LifeStories&#xD;
      modules. Participants in both groups will be asked to complete a midtreatment survey 2 weeks&#xD;
      after baseline, and a posttreatment survey 4 weeks after baseline (i.e. after completing the&#xD;
      4-week video intervention for those in the active condition).&#xD;

    <description>Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item (PHQ-9; Kroenke et al., 2001): The PHQ is a 9-item measure of depression severity, which asks respondents to report their frequency of depressive symptoms over the past two weeks, rated from 0 &quot;not at all&quot; to 3 &quot;nearly every day&quot;. The PHQ-9 provides a total score which indicates current depression severity according to the following levels: minimal, mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe. Higher scores indicate higher depression.</description>

    <description>Short Form Health Survey (SF-12; Ware et al., 1996): The SF-12 is a 12-item measure of quality of life and general functioning. Respondents are asked to rate their present level of health or emotion-related impairment in daily activities. Items are rated on a scale from 1 &quot;all of the time&quot; to 6 &quot;none of the time,&quot; with higher scores indicating greater health-related quality of life.</description>

    <description>Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-II (AAQ-II; Bond et al., 2011): The AAQ-II is a 10-item measure of psychological inflexibility and experiential avoidance. Items are rated on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 &quot;never true&quot; to 7 &quot;always true.&quot; A total score is calculated by reverse coding so that higher scores indicate greater psychological flexibility.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Post-treatment (4 weeks post baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>General Help Seeking Questionnaire (GHSQ; Wilson, Deane, Ciarocchi, &amp; Rickwood): We will use an adapted version of the GHSQ which is a validated measure of help-seeking intentions from a variety of formal (e.g. psychologist, PCP) and informal (e.g. friends, family) supports, rated on a 7-point scale from 1 &quot;extremely likely&quot; to 7 &quot;extremely unlikely,&quot; with higher scores on each item indicating greater likelihood of seeking help from that source.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-treatment (4 weeks post baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked to rate their adherence to the homework exercises from the online program on a 7-point scale from 1 &quot;did no recommended assignments&quot; to 7 &quot;did all recommended assignments,&quot; using a scale adapted from previous self-help studies (Abramowitz, Moore, Braddock, &amp; Harrington, 2009). Higher scores on this measure indicate greater treatment adherence.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-treatment (4 weeks post baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>System Usability Scale (SUS; Brooke, 1996): The SUS is a 10-item measure of usability and satisfaction with programs with established reliability and validity (Lewis, 2009). Items on the SUS are rated on a scale from 1 &quot;strongly disagree&quot; to 5 &quot;strongly disagree, with higher scores indicating greater treatment satisfaction. We will additionally ask those in the active condition a series of free-response questions assessing their favorite and least favorite aspects of LifeStories, as well as their perspectives on how using the program may have helped them manage depression.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in treatment utilization</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, post-treatment (4 weeks post baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>We will ask participants at baseline and post-treatment a series of yes/no questions that we constructed which ask if they are engaged in treatment with a mental health specialist, are planning to see a mental health specialist, or have made any recent changes to their antidepressant treatment.</description>

    <description>The content of LifeStories is divided thematically into core ACT concepts across the four episodes as follows: 1) cultivating awareness of the transient nature of mood experiences and the benefit of trying out various strategies to cope with depression when it arises; 2) clarifying one's own values and setting personal goals related to these values; 3) developing a more accepting and nonjudgmental stance towards difficult thoughts and feelings and practicing self-compassion;and 4) living more mindfully in the present moment.</description>
