      Prospective single arm study was to evaluate the clinical success and/ or failure of&#xD;
      resin-bonded composite coronal build-up retained by macro-retentive grooves for restoring&#xD;
      mutilated primary maxillary incisors after 36 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Forty two primary incisors out of 14 children, aged 2-5years, treated in a private&#xD;
      pediatric dental practice under general anesthesia and presented for follow-up after 6, 12,&#xD;
      18, 24 and 36 months included in the study. The parameters recorded at the baseline and at&#xD;
      the follow-up intervals were: retention, colour match, the number and location of the decayed&#xD;
      surfaces (recurrent caries), chipping /fracture of the restoration and loss of restoration&#xD;
      (failure).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods: A total of (14) pediatric patients aged from 2-5 years presented with&#xD;
      mutilated primary anterior teeth due to caries or trauma and treated comprehensively under&#xD;
      general anesthesia from June 2016 to June 2017 were enrolled in this study. A total of (42)&#xD;
      decayed or traumatized primary anterior teeth were treated with composite coronal build-up&#xD;
      based on the micro-mechanical adhesive procedure of composite resin in addition to macro&#xD;
      mechanical retentive grooves created on the lateral sides of the cervical one third of the&#xD;
      roots of treated teeth. The patients returned at the end of 6, 12, 18, 24 and 36 months and&#xD;
      received clinical examinations. Another dentist (co-author) who did not attend the treatment&#xD;
      evaluated the strip crowns clinically by modified United States Public Health Service (USPHS)&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;

      Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical success and/ or failure of&#xD;
      resin-bonded composite coronal build-up retained by macro-retentive grooves for restoring&#xD;
      mutilated primary maxillary incisors after 36 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Forty two primary incisors out of 14 children, aged 2-5years, treated in a private&#xD;
      pediatric dental practice under general anesthesia and presented for follow-up after 6, 12,&#xD;
      18, 24 and 36 months included in the study. The parameters recorded at the baseline and at&#xD;
      the follow-up intervals were: retention, colour match, the number and location of the decayed&#xD;
      surfaces (recurrent caries), chipping /fracture of the restoration and loss of restoration&#xD;
      (failure).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods: A total of (14) pediatric patients aged from 2-5 years presented with&#xD;
      mutilated primary anterior teeth due to caries or trauma and treated comprehensively under&#xD;
      general anesthesia from June 2016 to June 2017 were enrolled in this study. A total of (42)&#xD;
      decayed or traumatized primary anterior teeth were treated with composite coronal build-up&#xD;
      based on the micromechanical adhesive procedure of composite resin in addition to macro&#xD;
      mechanical retentive grooves created on the lateral sides of the cervical one third of the&#xD;
      roots of treated teeth. The patients returned at the end of 6, 12, 18, 24 and 36 months and&#xD;
      received clinical examinations. Another dentist (co-author) who did not attend the treatment&#xD;
      evaluated the strip crowns clinically by modified United States Public Health Service (USPHS)&#xD;
      criteria. The USPHS system is primarily for posterior teeth, so a new system was developed&#xD;
      for anterior teeth. The definitions and criteria for the rating system are detailed in Table&#xD;
      (1). Briefly, it was a photographic examination including an evaluation of the color, shape,&#xD;
      and integrity of the strip crown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients were recalled, and restorations were evaluated for anatomic form, surface&#xD;
      texture, recurrent caries, color match and retention in accordance with Ryge's Direct (US&#xD;
      Public Health Service) evaluation criteria at baseline (immediately postoperative), and&#xD;
      intervals of 6, 12, 24, and 36 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The crown was considered to be clinically successful, if the surface appeared smooth, the&#xD;
      colour remained good or acceptable, without chipping/ fracture or recurrent caries at&#xD;
      tooth/restoration interface and there is no loss of the restoration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data are analyzed using percentages, frequencies and cumulative frequencies. The Z-test will&#xD;
      be used for comparison between failure rates of the two types of failures (Failure due to&#xD;
      trauma &amp; failure of bonding), significance level is set at P&lt; 0·05. The Chi squared test will&#xD;
      be used for association between the number of affected surfaces and the total failures. The&#xD;
      level of significance (P-value) is set at P&lt; 0·05.&#xD;
