  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Long-term use of benzodiazepines is a long-standing problem, but the optimal withdrawal&#xD;
      modalities are not known. The main objective of this study is to compare the effectiveness of&#xD;
      a psychological support versus a psychotherapeutic intervention (Acceptance and Commitment&#xD;
      Therapy, ACT) added to a withdrawal program on the reduction of benzodiazepines use in adults&#xD;
      suffering from insomnia and hypnotic dependence.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Benzodiazepines and related drugs (BZDs) are effective for insomnia and anxiety in the short&#xD;
      term. After few months (four weeks regarding insomnia), the benefit/risk ratio is&#xD;
      considerably reduced. Nevertheless, between 2 and 5% of the general population uses them for&#xD;
      more than 6 months. Prescribing recommendations are unanimous concerning the short-term use&#xD;
      of these substances, but do not specify the optimal ways of reducing doses in a withdrawal&#xD;
      programme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many factors influence the success of withdrawal, including the duration of withdrawal (how&#xD;
      quickly doses are reduced), the half-life of the substance, and number of psychological&#xD;
      factors. Studies on BZD withdrawal show that, on average, spontaneous cessation of treatment&#xD;
      is 5-10%, withdrawal success is 30-40% following brief intervention and 60-80% following&#xD;
      Behavioral and Cognitive Therapy (CBT). These are few, and only one study has tested the&#xD;
      efficacy of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) for benzodiazepine withdrawal. ACT is a&#xD;
      contextual behavioral therapy which aims to increase acceptance of the full range of inner&#xD;
      experiences including negative thoughts, emotions and sensations, in order to promote&#xD;
      values-driven behavior change, leading to an improved quality of life. ACT is notably&#xD;
      effective for the treatment of anxiety disorders, depression, psychosis and chronic pain, and&#xD;
      some studies have shown the effectiveness of ACT for insomnia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a four-arms randomized controlled intervention which aims to evaluate the&#xD;
      addition to a taper program of an ACT intervention versus a psychological support on one&#xD;
      hand, and the duration of withdrawal on the other hand, in patients suffering from&#xD;
      hypnotic-dependent insomnia. The entire protocol will be remotely delivered, which no&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial has so far evaluated for benzodiazepine withdrawal.&#xD;

    <description>Proportion of participants who successfully discontinue benzodiazepines (i.e., no benzodiazepine used for 2 weeks preceding assessment and negative on the urine test for BZD) at 4 weeks posttreatment, 6 months posttreatment, 12 months posttreatment and 24 months posttreatment. Successful discontinuation is defined as completion of the taper schedule without significant deviation and no use of benzodiazepine medications beyond &quot;minimal Pro re nata. use&quot; during the month following the zero-dose date. Minimal BZD use (not considered discontinuation failures): use of no more than 2 Pro Re Nata doses of medication (each not exceeding 0.5 mg diazepam) during the 2 weeks period starting at the zero-dose date. This criterion ensures that taking a minimal P.R.N. dose in extraordinary circumstances will not be considered discontinuation failures.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Drinking more than 3 alcoholic beverages per day&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Presence of terminal illness (e.g. cancer, receiving palliative care)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unstable cardiovascular, respiratory or endocrinological diseases (clinical interview)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Had a history of severe cognitive impairment, dementia, seizure disorder (epilepsy&#xD;
             either in themselves or in their family), spinal injury&#xD;
