  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is frequent and has been directly related to high mortality&#xD;
      rates. The pathophysiology of TR is mainly functional as it occurs predominantly in the&#xD;
      context of left-sided heart disease, pulmonary hypertension, or atrial fibrillation. Surgery&#xD;
      is currently the primary treatment option in patients with functional TR. However, isolated&#xD;
      tricuspid valve surgery is associated with an intolerable high risk of operative mortality&#xD;
      and poor outcomes. New transcatheter options could be used in high-surgical risk patients.&#xD;
      However, with often severely dilated annuli with a non-planar and elliptical shape, absence&#xD;
      of calcification, and proximity of structures, the tricuspid valve anatomy poses many&#xD;
      challenges.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Predictors of outcome are yet to be defined in patients with TR in order to improve risk&#xD;
      prediction for the different treatment modalities (medical, surgical, interventional). The&#xD;
      Tricuspid Regurgitation Hamburg Cohort (TRUTH) aims to monitor patients with relevant TR,&#xD;
      irrespective of the underlying etiology or therapeutic approach. In addition to available&#xD;
      evidence from previously published clinical trials, elaborate prospective clinical&#xD;
      registries, such as TRUTH, that monitor clinical routine and current practice, will be of&#xD;
      significant importance to further enhance therapeutic options.&#xD;
