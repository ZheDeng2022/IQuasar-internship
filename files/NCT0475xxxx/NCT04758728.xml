      Aim of the present study is to investigate the efficiency of adrenaline (epinephrine) used&#xD;
      locally in reducing and avoiding post-operative formation of subcutaneous ecchymoses and&#xD;
      hematomas, in comparison with traditional practice of hemostasis, and to assess improvement&#xD;
      in the quality of life of subjects undergoing classic great saphenous vein stripping, who&#xD;
      received or did not receive adrenaline as a local hemostatic.&#xD;

      Introduction Quality of life of subjects undergoing classic great saphenous vein stripping is&#xD;
      analogous of the gravity of subcutaneous ecchymoses and hematomas formation, as a result of&#xD;
      surgical interventions during open surgery, when the great saphenous vein is being removed.&#xD;
      Adrenaline (epinephrine) is a potent vasoconstrictor, whose local hemostatic ability has&#xD;
      already been documented and applied in many medical specialties. Aim of the present study to&#xD;
      investigate the efficiency of adrenaline (epinephrine) used locally in reducing and avoiding&#xD;
      post-operative formation of subcutaneous ecchymoses and hematomas, in comparison with&#xD;
      traditional practice of hemostasis, and to assess improvement in the quality of life of&#xD;
      subjects undergoing classic great saphenous vein stripping, who received or did not receive&#xD;
      adrenaline as a local hemostatic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material-Methods 40 subjects diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) and/or&#xD;
      varicose veins of the lower limbs of varied clinical gravity (CEAP classification II &amp; III),&#xD;
      admitted in the department of Vascular Surgery for open surgical management, i.e. great&#xD;
      saphenous vein stripping +/- removal of varicosities, will be enrolled after signing an&#xD;
      informed consent for their participation in the study. They will be then randomized into 3&#xD;
      separate groups: Group A - great saphenous vein stripping with local adrenaline use for&#xD;
      hemostasis Group B - great saphenous vein stripping with local normal saline use for&#xD;
      hemostasis Group C - great saphenous vein stripping with traditional hemostatic practice&#xD;
      Study subjects will be followed-up after surgery, and in each group measurement of ecchymoses&#xD;
      (small 2-5mm2 and large &gt;5mm2) and hematomas (medium 0,2-1cm and large &gt;1cm) will be&#xD;
      performed by using ImageJ software after digital high-resolution photographing on 1st, 8th&#xD;
      and 14th post-operative days. Quality of life of subjects will be assessed pre-operatively&#xD;
      and 1 month post-operatively, by using SF-36 and CIVIQ-2 questionnaires for QoL in CVI.&#xD;

    <time_frame>24 hours pre-operatively</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life assessment based on the 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36) questionnaire preoperatively. It is an often-used, well-researched, self-reported measure of health. It stems from a study called the Medical Outcomes Study. It taps eight health concepts: physical functioning, bodily pain, role limitations due to physical health problems, role limitations due to personal or emotional problems, emotional well-being, social functioning, energy/fatigue, and general health perceptions. It also includes a single item that provides an indication of perceived change in health. The eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section are directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.</description>

    <description>Quality of life assessment based on the ChronIc Venous Insufficiency quality of life Questionnaire version 2 (CIVIQ-2) questionnaire preoperatively. The CIVIQ was developed and validated (relevance, acceptability, reliability, construct validity, and sensitivity) by French researchers in 1996. The CIVIQ is a 20-item self-reported instrument that includes four categories of questions: physical (4 items), psychological (9 items), social (4 items), and pain (3 items). Its score ranges from 0, the worst score, to 100, the best. There are five possible answers (from 1 to 5) to describe each symptom and the sensation of discomfort. The second version, the CIVIQ-2 (where 2 denotes the second draft of the same questionnaire), provides a global score covering all aspects of the questionnaire and weighs the categories equally.</description>
