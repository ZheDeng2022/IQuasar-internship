    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to conduct a pilot feasibility study a novel informatics&#xD;
      intervention, GlucoType (also called Platano for Latino users) that incorporates&#xD;
      computational analysis of self-monitoring data to help individuals with type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      personalize diabetes self-management strategies. This study will include 20 individuals with&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) recruited from economically disadvantaged and medically&#xD;
      underserved communities to test Platano for 4 weeks to assess its acceptability and&#xD;
      feasibility. The main outcome measures include problem-solving abilities in diabetes&#xD;
      (Diabetes Problem-Solving Inventory (DPSA)) and self-reported diabetes self-care (Summary of&#xD;
      Diabetes Self-Care Activities Questionnaire (SDSCA)). In addition, this study will include a&#xD;
      controlled laboratory experiment to assess whether participants can understand and follow&#xD;
      personalized nutritional goals generated by Platano.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Growing evidence highlights significant differences in individuals' physiology and glycemic&#xD;
      function and their cultural, social, and economical circumstances that impact diabetes&#xD;
      self-management. These discoveries paved the way for precision medicine-an approach to&#xD;
      personalizing medical treatment to an individual's genetic makeup, clinical history, and&#xD;
      lifestyle. Computational learning methods have been successfully used for identifying&#xD;
      clinical phenotypes-observable manifestations of diseases. Studies showed the benefits of&#xD;
      tailoring not only medical treatment, but also behavioral interventions; however, tailoring&#xD;
      typically relies on expert identification of tailoring variables and decision rules, and on&#xD;
      standard surveys. Data collected with self-monitoring can more accurately reflect an&#xD;
      individual's behaviors and glycemic patterns, thus highlighting their &quot;behavioral&#xD;
      phenotypes&quot;, yet such data are rarely utilized in tailoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ongoing focus of this research is on facilitating problem-solving in diabetes&#xD;
      self-management. Well-developed problem-solving skills are essential to diabetes management&#xD;
      result in better diabetes self-care behaviors lead to improvements in clinical outcomes and&#xD;
      can be fostered with face-to-face interventions. Previous research suggested problem&#xD;
      identification and generation of alternatives as critical steps in problem-solving in&#xD;
      diabetes. In previous work, the investigators developed an informatics intervention that&#xD;
      relied on expert-generated knowledge for assisting individuals on these steps of&#xD;
      problem-solving. In this pilot feasibility study, the investigators study an alternative&#xD;
      solution that relies on computational pattern analysis of data collected with self-monitoring&#xD;
      technologies to tailor the problem-solving assistance to individuals' unique behavioral&#xD;
      phenotypes. The intervention, GlucoType uses computational learning methods to identify&#xD;
      systematic patterns in individuals' diet, physical activity, and sleep, captured with&#xD;
      custom-built and commercial self-monitoring technologies, and correlates these patterns with&#xD;
      fluctuations in individuals' blood glucose levels. GlucoType then uses this information to 1)&#xD;
      identify behavioral patterns associated with high glycemic excursion, 2) formulate&#xD;
      personalized goals to modify these behaviors, 3) provide in-the-moment decision support to&#xD;
      help individuals be more consistent in meeting their goals.&#xD;

    <description>GlucoType is an mobile Health intervention for facilitating self-management in T2DM built for iPhone and Android smartphones. GlucoType includes a custom-built interface for low-burden capture of diet and blood glucose (BG) levels and relies on a commercial activity tracker, FitBit, for capture of sleep and physical activity. It then applies computational phenotyping techniques to identify patterns of associations between daily activities and changes in BG levels. GlucoType uses an expert system developed by our research team to translate identified phenotypes into automatically-generated personalized behavioral goals for improving glycemic control formulated in natural language.</description>
