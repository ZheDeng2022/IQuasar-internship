  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Therefore, the aim of this study was to confirm by a randomized double-blind controlled study&#xD;
      the beneficial effects of saffron extract (Saffr'activ®) on sleep quality in subjects&#xD;
      presenting mild to moderate sleep disorder associated with anxiety.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study has been designed as a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled interventional&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sixty-six subjects were randomly allocated to the control (placebo) or test (Saffr'activ®)&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A screening visit was scheduled within 4 weeks before Day -7 (study inclusion). At Day -7 and&#xD;
      Day 0, questionnaires were completed to evaluate sleep quality, stress level and quality of&#xD;
      life. Between Day -7 and Day 0 baseline data for actimeter and sleep diary were registered.&#xD;
      Then, subjects were supplemented during 6 weeks with the placebo or saffron (Saffr'activ®)&#xD;
      product, depending on their group. Following the baseline period, two other periods of one&#xD;
      week were scheduled to collect actigraphy data: between 2 and 3 (from Day 14 to Day 21) weeks&#xD;
      and between 5 and 6 (from Day 35 to Day 42) weeks after the beginning of the intervention. At&#xD;
      the middle (Day 21) and at the end of the study (Day 42), questionnaires were completed to&#xD;
      evaluate sleep quality, stress level and/or quality of life.&#xD;
