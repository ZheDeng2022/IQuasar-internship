      This is an open-labeled, laboratory-blinded, randomized, two period, single-center,&#xD;
      crossover, comparative study, where each participant will be randomly assigned to the&#xD;
      reference (Xarelto®, 10 mg film-coated tablets) or the test (Rivaroxaban, 10 mg film-coated&#xD;
      tablets) formulation in each period of study (sequences Test-Reference (TR) or Reference-Test&#xD;
      (RT)), in order to evaluate if both formulations are bioequivalent.&#xD;
