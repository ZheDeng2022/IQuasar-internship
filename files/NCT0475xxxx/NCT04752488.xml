  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Telerehabilitation offers more efficient follow-up of patients during their home exercise&#xD;
      period as a cost-effective and effective treatment model. This study was planned to examine&#xD;
      the effectiveness of telerehabilitation in patients with chronic neck pain. The aim of the&#xD;
      study is to compare the video-based and telerehabilitation based home-exercise program in&#xD;
      patients with chronic neck pain. It is aimed to evaluate the patients in terms of pain,&#xD;
      functionality, quality of life, and exercise adherence.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With telerehabilitation, patients can easily adapt to home exercise programs and be monitored&#xD;
      remotely. In this way, it will be ensured that individuals can apply their exercises at an&#xD;
      optimum level in non-clinical settings and to prevent exercise application errors that occur&#xD;
      due to the learning effect frequently observed in conventional methods. Exercise is&#xD;
      considered a central element in physical therapy and rehabilitation management in patients&#xD;
      with chronic neck pain. However, studies have found that improvements after physical therapy&#xD;
      and rehabilitation are not preserved in the long term, and recurrence of chronic low back&#xD;
      pain is common. With a more cost-effective treatment model, &quot;telerehabilitation&quot;, it is aimed&#xD;
      that patients can be followed more efficiently during their home exercise period. The aim of&#xD;
      the study is to compare the video-based and telerehabilitation based home-exercise program in&#xD;
      patients with chronic neck pain. It is aimed to evaluate the patients in terms of pain,&#xD;
      functionality, quality of life, and exercise adherence.&#xD;

    <measure>Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The patients will be asked to mark their pain feelings for rest and activity on a 10 cm numerical line (0: no pain, 10: unbearable pain). It is planned to use numerical VAS in our study. The cut-off values for chronic musculoskeletal pain will be classified as the severity of pain according to VAS as follows:&#xD;
&lt;3.4 centimeters: mild pain, 3.5-7.4 centimeters: moderate pain, &gt; 7.5 centimeters: severe pain.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Neck Disability Index (NDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>NDI consists of 10 titles: pain intensity, personal care, lifting, reading, headache, concentration, study, driving, sleeping, and recreation. For each item included in the study; 0 indicates &quot;no disability&quot; and 5 represents &quot;complete disability&quot; Participants will be asked to give points between these scores. The total score ranges between 0 (no disability) and 50 (complete disability).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Short Form-36 (SF-36)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>SF-36 consists of thirty-six items. These provide measurements of eight dimensions. Subscales evaluate health between 0-100 points; '0' indicates poor health, '100' indicates good health.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Exercise Adherence Rating Scale (EARS)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>EARS provides a measurement of commitment to home exercise. This may facilitate the evaluation of interventions that promote self-management, for the treatment of chronic conditions.</description>
