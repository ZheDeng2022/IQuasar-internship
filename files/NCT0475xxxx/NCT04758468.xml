  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effectiveness of pelvic floor muscle training on urinary incontinence and sexual function&#xD;
      has been known for many years. However, the evaluation of its effectiveness in people with&#xD;
      Multiple Sclerosis (MS) has recently begun and the level of evidence is limited. In addition,&#xD;
      the applicability of pelvic floor muscle training based on telerehabilitation in the presence&#xD;
      of a physiotherapist has not been investigated before.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this study;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The main aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of&#xD;
           telerehabilitation-based pelvic floor muscle training under the guidance of a&#xD;
           physiotherapist, which will be applied for the first time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Another aim is to compare this method with the effects of not receiving treatment other&#xD;
           than usual treatment or receiving home-based pelvic floor muscle training on urinary&#xD;
           incontinence, sexual dysfunction and psychosocial outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will randomly be allocated into three groups: (1) Telerehabilitation-based&#xD;
      pelvic floor muscle training, (2) Home-based pelvic floor muscle training, and (3) Control&#xD;
      group Telerehabilitation-based pelvic floor muscle training group will individually receive&#xD;
      telerehabilitation-based pelvic floor muscle training under the guidance of a physiotherapist&#xD;
      2 sessions per week for 8 weeks. Participants will do their exercises themselves 2 times on&#xD;
      the days where sessions are held with a physiotherapist. Participants will continue to&#xD;
      exercise 3 times a day in the remaining days. The home-based pelvic floor muscle training&#xD;
      group will do their individual exercises 3 times a day for 8 weeks. The control group will&#xD;
      receive no specific training&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Both intervention groups will follow the same pelvic floor muscle training protocol for 8&#xD;
      weeks, but the home-based group will follow the exercise protocol individually while the&#xD;
      telerehabilitation-based group will follow the telerehabilitation-based under the guidance of&#xD;
      the physiotherapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercises will be applied 3 times a day according to the specified protocol. An information&#xD;
      leaflet will be distributed to the home exercise group. The telerehabilitation-based group&#xD;
      will receive telerehabilitation-based pelvic floor muscle training under the guidance of a&#xD;
      physiotherapist individually for 2 sessions a week, the patient will do the exercises twice a&#xD;
      day in the days of the sessions with the physiotherapist, and the remaining days will&#xD;
      continue to do it 3 times a day like a home exercise group. The control group will not&#xD;
      receive treatment other than their routine treatment, and the patients will be informed that&#xD;
      they will be treated if they wish at the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The progression in Pelvic Floor Muscle Training will be achieved by increasing the exercise&#xD;
      volume and diversifying the positions. The assessments will be applied at baseline, 4, 8, and&#xD;
      12 weeks.&#xD;

While 0 shows normal neurological findings, 10 means death due to MS. In this scale in which pyramidal, cerebral, cerebellar, visual, sensory, brainstem, bladder and bowel functions are scored, the best performance of the patient without any special effort is evaluated.</description>

    <measure>Change in International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Urinary Incontinence Short Form Score</measure>
    <time_frame>The assessments will be applied at baseline, 4, 8, and 12 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Urinary Incontinence Short Form was developed to evaluate the effect of urinary incontinence and urinary incontinence on quality of life. The scale has four dimensions. The first dimension questions the frequency of urinary incontinence, the second dimension questions the amount of incontinence, the third dimension questions the effect of urinary incontinence on daily life, and the fourth dimension questions the conditions that cause urinary incontinence. In the evaluation, the first three dimensions are scored. Responses to the fourth dimension are used to determine the type of urinary incontinence based on the individual's complaints. The scores that can be obtained from the scale range from 0-21; a low score indicates that urinary incontinence affects the quality of lifeless, while a high score indicates that it affects a lot.</description>
