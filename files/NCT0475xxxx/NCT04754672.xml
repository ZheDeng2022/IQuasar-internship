  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Evidence from randomized controlled trials shows that exercise during cancer treatment&#xD;
      benefits physical fitness, fatigue and quality of life. Since the effect of exercise on&#xD;
      clinical outcome is currently unknown, exercise is not included as integral part of standard&#xD;
      cancer care. Moreover, evidence regarding the optimal exercise prescription in terms of type&#xD;
      and dose is lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To maintain quality of life in patients receiving palliative treatment with chemotherapy,&#xD;
      toxicity-induced modifications in the prescribed chemotherapy dose are common. Such&#xD;
      modifications - occurring in 40% of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer - may reduce&#xD;
      benefit of treatment. The investigators hypothesize that exercise prevents chemotherapy dose&#xD;
      modifications by reducing toxicity and enhancing psychological strength. Additionally, based&#xD;
      on studies in rodents and preliminary data in patients with cancer, the researchers&#xD;
      hypothesize that exercise has beneficial effects on the functionality of the natural killer&#xD;
      cells, which play an important role in the innate immune defense against cancer. Both, fewer&#xD;
      dose modifications and improved immune function may improve progression-free survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a three-armed trial comparing resistance exercise, aerobic interval exercise&#xD;
      and usual care in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer to select the optimal exercise&#xD;
      prescription for preventing chemotherapy dose modifications. The trial will use a Bayesian&#xD;
      adaptive multi-arm multi-stage design with several interim analyses after which an&#xD;
      ineffective study arm can be dropped early. This novel design makes the trial more efficient&#xD;
      and reduces patients' exposure to suboptimal study arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence regarding the exercise effects on i) clinical outcome, ii) the optimal exercise&#xD;
      prescription, and iii) the underlying mechanisms, elucidates the potential of exercise to&#xD;
      boost benefit from chemotherapy treatment. This evidence provides leads to improve&#xD;
      progression-free survival and quality of life of patients suffering from one of the leading&#xD;
      causes of cancer death worldwide.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      First-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer generally includes the chemotherapies&#xD;
      oxaliplatin and fluoropyrimidines, known as CAPOX and FOLFOX. A previous study showed that&#xD;
      over 40% of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer required dose modifications (including&#xD;
      dose reductions, treatment delays or discontinuation) within the first three months of&#xD;
      palliative treatment, and around 30% was admitted to hospital due to chemotherapy-related&#xD;
      toxicity. Toxicity-induced dose modifications and hospitalization may reduce benefit of&#xD;
      treatment. In patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, reductions in muscle mass and lower&#xD;
      physical activity levels (&lt;9 metabolic equivalent of task hours/week) were found to be&#xD;
      associated with more dose-limiting toxicity and shorter (progression-free) survival. However,&#xD;
      the causality and underlying mechanisms linking physical activity and exercise to cancer&#xD;
      outcome have not been elucidated. The immune system (by increased infiltration of activated&#xD;
      natural killer cells into the tumour) might play a role as was shown in studies with rodents.&#xD;
      In addition, studies among patients showed that exercise may counteract a variety of&#xD;
      treatment toxicities (e.g. neutropenia, neuropathy, gastrointestinal side effects, fatigue),&#xD;
      but optimal exercise type and dose are unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the above-mentioned biophysiological effects by which exercise may prevent&#xD;
      dose modifications, several studies demonstrated the positive effects of exercise during&#xD;
      cancer treatment on quality of life. A recent study on patients' perceptions indicated that&#xD;
      exercise helped patients to better cope with cancer treatments, as it gave them psychological&#xD;
      strength (i.e. empowerment and resilience) next to physical strength. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that exercise reduces treatment-related toxicity and thereby reduces chemotherapy&#xD;
      dose modifications and improves progression free survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      randomised controlled trials are the gold standard for ascertaining treatment efficacy.&#xD;
      Studying differences in effects on chemotherapy dose modifications between different exercise&#xD;
      programs requires a multi-arm randomised controlled trial. Due to complex logistics and high&#xD;
      costs, the conduct of a traditional adequately powered multi-arm exercise trial is difficult&#xD;
      with available patients and resources. Therefore, a Bayesian adaptive flexible multi-arm&#xD;
      multi-stage design will be used which allows for a number of interim analyses after which a&#xD;
      treatment arm can be dropped early if it falls outside the pre-defined futility/efficacy&#xD;
      boundaries. This reduces patients' exposure to suboptimal interventions and increases trial&#xD;
      efficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to examine whether:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Exercise prevents chemotherapy dose modifications via reduced toxicity and enhanced&#xD;
           psychological strength, and which exercise program yields largest benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Exercise improves immune function (e.g. functionality of natural killer cells).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Benefits of exercise on dose modifications and immune function improves progression-free&#xD;
           survival.&#xD;
