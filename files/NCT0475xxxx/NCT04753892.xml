  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The 3Sm challenge study is a small clinical study in eight healthy volunteers who will be&#xD;
      injected with a protein which includes a short portion ('3Sm peptide') which is derived from&#xD;
      a part (the '3S region') of the coat protein of HIV. The researchers believe that the 3Sm&#xD;
      peptide might trigger an immune response which includes rare antibodies able to neutralise a&#xD;
      wide range of different strains of HIV. The results will be useful in guiding the development&#xD;
      of future vaccines against HIV, and other diseases.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Healthy male and female participants aged between 18 and 55 years on the day of&#xD;
             screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Willing and able to provide written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Available for all follow-up visits for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Entered into and obtained clearance from The Over volunteering Prevention System&#xD;
             (TOPS) database (to avoid impact of any co-administered investigational products or&#xD;
             treatments on our outcomes).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. If female and of childbearing potential, willing to use a highly effective method of&#xD;
             contraception from screening until a minimum of 6 weeks after the last immunogen&#xD;
             challenge. Periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal and post-ovulation methods)&#xD;
             and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. If male and not sterilised, willing to avoid impregnating female partners through the&#xD;
             use of condoms or sexual abstinence from screening until a minimum of 6 weeks after&#xD;
             the last immunogen challenge, unless female partners are using a highly effective&#xD;
             method during the same time period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Registered with a GP in the UK prior to enrolment into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Willing to grant authorised persons access to his/her trial-related medical record and&#xD;
             GP records either directly or indirectly&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Willing to avoid all vaccines from within 4 weeks before the first immunogen challenge&#xD;
             through to 4 weeks after the final challenge, with the exception of seasonal influenza&#xD;
             vaccine which may be given more than 7 days before or after the experimental&#xD;
             immunogen, and deployed COVID-19 vaccine which may be given 14 days before or after&#xD;
             the experimental immunogen (and at least 28 days is encouraged). It is recommended&#xD;
             that participants have an up to date vaccination status for any required&#xD;
             immunisations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Pregnant or lactating&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. History of any physical, medical, psychological or other condition, clinically&#xD;
             significant laboratory, vital sign or examination finding at screening, or use of any&#xD;
             medications which, in the opinion of the investigators, would interfere with the study&#xD;
             objectives or participant's safety. This includes where there is a history of active&#xD;
             disease requiring a clinically significant recent or planned investigation or change&#xD;
             in treatment, including cardiac, respiratory, endocrine, metabolic, autoimmune, liver,&#xD;
             neurological, oncological, psychiatric, immunosuppresive/immunodeficient or other&#xD;
             disorders. Individuals with mild/moderate, well-controlled co-morbidities, of those&#xD;
             that are no longer deemed clinically active or clinically significant by the&#xD;
             investigator are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. History of anaphylaxis or angioedema.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. History of severe or multiple allergies to drugs or pharmaceutical agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. History of severe local or general reaction to vaccination defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. local: extensive, indurated redness and swelling involving most of the arm, not&#xD;
                  resolving within 72 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. general: fever ≥39.5 °C within 48 hours; bronchospasm; laryngeal oedema;&#xD;
                  collapse; convulsions or encephalopathy within 72 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Previous receipt of an investigational vaccine or immunogen based on HIV envelope.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Detection of antibodies to HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Detection of antibodies to Hepatitis C.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Unable to read and/or speak English to a fluency level adequate for the full&#xD;
             comprehension of study procedures and consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Participation in another study, or treatment with an investigational drug within 28&#xD;
             days of screening, which in the opinion of the investigator would interfere with study&#xD;
             objectives or compromise the participant's safety.&#xD;
