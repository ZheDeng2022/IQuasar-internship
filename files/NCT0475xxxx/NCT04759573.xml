  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Preterm infants are at risk for developing altered trajectories of cognitive,&#xD;
      social, and linguistic competences compared to a term population. This is mainly due to&#xD;
      medical and environmental factors, as they are exposed to an atypical auditory environment&#xD;
      and, simultaneously, to long periods of early separation from their parents. The short-term&#xD;
      effects of Early Vocal Contact (EVC) on an infant's early stability have been investigated,&#xD;
      but currently, there is limited evidence of its impact on the infant's autonomic nervous&#xD;
      system maturation, as indexed by the heart rate variability, as well as on its long-term&#xD;
      impact on infant neurodevelopment. This multi-centric study aims to investigate the effects&#xD;
      of EVC on a preterm infant's physiology, neurobehaviour, and development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Eighty stable preterm infants, born at 25 to 32 weeks and 6 days gestational age,&#xD;
      without specific abnormalities, will be selected and randomized to either an intervention or&#xD;
      a control group. The intervention group will receive EVC: mothers talking and singing to&#xD;
      their preterm infants for 10 minutes thrice a week for 2 weeks. Mothers in the control group&#xD;
      will be encouraged to spend the same amount of time next to the incubator, observing the&#xD;
      infant's behaviour through a standard cluster of indicators. Infants will be assessed at&#xD;
      baseline, at the end of the intervention, at term equivalent age, and at 3, 6, 12- and&#xD;
      24-months corrected age, with a battery of physiological, neurobehavioral, and developmental&#xD;
      measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion: Early interventions in the neonatal intensive care unit have shown important&#xD;
      effects on the neurodevelopment of preterm infants, lowering the negative long-term effects&#xD;
      of an atypical auditory and interactional environment. This study will provide new insights&#xD;
      into the mother-infant early contact as protective intervention against the sequelae of&#xD;
      prematurity during the sensitive period of development. An early intervention, such as EVC,&#xD;
      is intuitive and easy to implement in the daily care of preterm infants. However, its&#xD;
      long-term effects on infant neurodevelopment and on maternal sensitivity and stress still&#xD;
      need accurate investigations.&#xD;

      Aims This study aims to test the effects of EVC on infants born prematurely between 25 and 32&#xD;
      weeks and 6 days GA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effects on newborns will be assessed at physiological (primary outcome), neurobehavioral,&#xD;
      and developmental levels during the intervention, at term equivalent age, and at 12- and&#xD;
      24-months CA. The effect of EVC will also be assessed on maternal stress at hospital&#xD;
      discharge and on the mother's presence in the NICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design A four-site randomized controlled trial will be conducted to investigate the short-&#xD;
      and long-term physiological and neurobehavioral effects of EVC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants Eighty preterm infants, born at 25 to 32 weeks and 6 days GA, will be recruited&#xD;
      from the four centres (20 per centre).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment will be undertaken in each centre by a trained research assistant (RA), who will&#xD;
      review birth records daily. After obtaining permission from the attending physicians of both&#xD;
      the mother and the infant, the RA will invite qualifying families to participate in the study&#xD;
      and will obtain written informed consent from those enrolling. Infants will be then assigned&#xD;
      to the EVC intervention or control group using a randomized design, stratifying infants by&#xD;
      gender and GA (see Randomization). Mothers whose infants are assigned to the control group&#xD;
      will be asked to spend the same amount of time as that of mothers in the intervention group,&#xD;
      observing their infants' spontaneous behaviour, with the subsequent compilation of an&#xD;
      observation grid developed ad hoc, according to few indicators drawn from The Neonatal&#xD;
      Behavioural Assessment Scale (NBAS).&#xD;

    <description>The General Movement quality from video recording will be scored according to the Ferrari optimality score. Two blinded coders will attribute a single final score for each infant at each time point. For each item a description of optimal performance is given and scored with &quot;2&quot; (e.g., cramped components are absent). Less optimal performance is scored with &quot;1&quot; (e.g., cramped components are occasionally present); non-optimal performance is scored with &quot;0&quot; (e.g., cramped components are predominately present).&#xD;
Adding the scores of each item within a category (&quot;neck and trunk&quot;, &quot;upper extremity&quot; and &quot;lower extremity&quot;) plus the score for &quot;sequence&quot; gives the GM optimality score with a minimum value of 5 and a maximum value of 42, indicating optimal performance.

    <description>The EVC will take place in the hospital room while infants are in their individual incubators or open cribs. In the intervention group, mothers will be asked to speak and sing to their infants continuously over a 10-min period for each type of intervention (20 min in total). Mothers will be asked to talk in their native language and to sing familiar songs, while observing their infant's reactions. The order of the two vocalizations, speaking and singing, will be reversed in the next intervention.&#xD;
Early Vocal Contact will be performed by mothers three times a week for 2 weeks, more than one hour after afternoon feeding. It will begin when the newborns are in an active sleep state, in calm awake state or in active awake state, but not in deep sleep or crying. Preterm infants will be enrolled from 25+0 to 32+6 weeks of GA, following the established inclusion criteria.</description>
