    <textblock>
      Participants with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders who are experiencing active symptoms of&#xD;
      psychosis will randomized to either receive 6 months of individual cognitive behavioural&#xD;
      therapy for psychosis or to receive treatment as usual. Participants will be assessed at&#xD;
      baseline, 6 months, and 12 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia-spectrum disorders are the most persistent, debilitating, and economically&#xD;
      burdensome mental illnesses worldwide, and are associated with the greatest per-patient&#xD;
      expense of all mental health conditions. Schizophrenia is associated with a 15-20 year&#xD;
      decrease in life expectancy, 5-fold increase in likelihood of death by suicide, and a&#xD;
      significant decrease in quality of life. Antipsychotic medications are the first line&#xD;
      treatment for individuals with schizophrenia spectrum disorders and are prescribed to nearly&#xD;
      every service-user. However, in the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention&#xD;
      Effectiveness (CATIE) trial (one of the largest antipsychotic trials in 1493 individuals with&#xD;
      schizophrenia), medication effects on psychosocial functioning were small (d = 0.25). Thus,&#xD;
      the primary treatment available to all individuals with schizophrenia does little to improve&#xD;
      community functioning. This may partially be a result of the limited efficacy of&#xD;
      antipsychotic medication to improve neurocognitive abilities, widely recognized as a core&#xD;
      feature of schizophrenia, and one recommendation stemming from the CATIE trial was that &quot;more&#xD;
      intensive psychosocial rehabilitative services, including cognitive rehabilitation, may be&#xD;
      needed to affect more substantial gains in functioning.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a psychological intervention originally developed to&#xD;
      treat depression, and subsequently adapted to treat schizophrenia spectrum disorders. CBT has&#xD;
      demonstrated moderate treatment effects (d = 0.36 - 0.44) in multiple meta-analyses and is&#xD;
      widely recommended for the treatment of schizophrenia in international guidelines. CBT&#xD;
      involves clients learning to evaluate their cognitive content in order to develop more&#xD;
      accurate representations of the world. CBT has proven effective for improving hallucinations,&#xD;
      delusions, negative symptoms, and personal recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the established efficacy of CBT delivered through in-person methods, most clinics&#xD;
      have discontinued in-person treatments as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and have moved to&#xD;
      virtual delivery methods. While it has been assumed that virtual delivery of CBT is&#xD;
      equivalent to in-person delivery, our recent systematic review demonstrated that there has&#xD;
      never been a trial examining the efficacy of virtually delivered CBT for psychosis.&#xD;
      Characteristics of schizophrenia such as paranoia, and disorganization already present&#xD;
      challenges to psychological treatment and it is possible that this challenge will be further&#xD;
      exacerbated by treatment delivery through virtual methods. Additionally, it is unclear the&#xD;
      extent to which individuals with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders will be interested in&#xD;
      receiving virtual CBT and capable of using the technology that is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus the goals of the current study are two-fold:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Examine the efficacy of virtually delivered CBT for schizophrenia-spectrum disorders to&#xD;
           reduce symptoms and improve community functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Examine the feasibility and acceptability of virtually-delivered CBT for individuals&#xD;
           with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CBT will be delivered according to an established manual that the PI has previously used&#xD;
      successfully for in-person treatment. Treatment will consist of individual sessions with a&#xD;
      therapist for 1-hour per week for 6-months. Therapists will be either a registered clinical&#xD;
      psychologist or a graduate student in clinical psychology under the supervision of a&#xD;
      registered clinical psychologist. All treatment will be delivered virtually in the&#xD;
      participant's home using the online platform Zoom which is PHIPA/PIPEDA compliant. If&#xD;
      participants do not have the technology required for virtual sessions then a tablet will be&#xD;
      loaned to them for the duration of treatment. This treatment will be delivered in addition to&#xD;
      usual care and no changes to usual care will be required.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Participants will be informed after their first assessment whether they were randomized to CBTp or TAU. Those in TAU are offered CBTp at the end of the study period. Assessors remain blind throughout the study and therefore do not partake in the treatment intervention. Due to the nature of the study, the treatment providers cannot be blinded as those they treat have clearly been randomized to the CBTp condition. The investigator is not blind to any of the randomization outcomes.</masking_description>
