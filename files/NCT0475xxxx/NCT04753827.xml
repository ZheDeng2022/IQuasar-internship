  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of coronary bifurcation lesions continue to remain challenges. Due to the&#xD;
      complexity of the anatomical structure and the limitations of imaging, there are poor&#xD;
      attachment and under-expansion of the stent at the branch ostium, which causes in-stent&#xD;
      thrombosis and restenosis. The delayed re-endothelialization arise from multi-layer stents.&#xD;
      The one-stent strategy causes the displacement of the plaques and ridges of the branch&#xD;
      ostium, and thus insufficient blood flow to the branches. The &quot;L-sandwich&quot; strategy, stents&#xD;
      were implanted in the main vessel(MV) and the shaft of side branch(SB) respectively, then a&#xD;
      drug-coated balloon(DCB) was applied to the ostium of the SB, to improve the tedious&#xD;
      operation process in true bifurcation lesions and reduce postoperative complications. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study was to explore the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of the &quot;sandwich&quot;&#xD;
      strategy.&#xD;

      This is a study to evaluate the application of L-Sandwich in true bifurcation coronary artery&#xD;
      disease.All eligible patients were randomly divided into three groups: experimental group 1:&#xD;
      dual stent group: both main vessel(MV) and side branch(SB) were stented, and DK-Crush or&#xD;
      Culotte were performed according to different pathological characteristics. Experimental&#xD;
      group 2: single stent + drug-coated balloon（DCB）: stent was implanted in the MV, and only&#xD;
      drug balloon was used in the SB.Experimental group 3: L-Sandwich : stent was implanted in the&#xD;
      MV, and the branch was implanted 3-5mm away from the ostium，and the DCB was implanted in the&#xD;
      ostium of the branch.IVUS+ angiography was used to guide the operation and evaluate the&#xD;
      outcome.&#xD;
