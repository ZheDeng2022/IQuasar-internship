  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Genetic testing is a type of test that detects changes to the genes-the DNA instructions that&#xD;
      are passed on from the mother and father. The results of a genetic test can confirm whether&#xD;
      the participant has a genetic disorder, which is a disease caused in whole or in part by&#xD;
      changes to the genes. Genetic testing can also help determine a person's chance of getting or&#xD;
      passing on a genetic disorder. Genetic tests use a sample of blood, hair, skin, or other&#xD;
      tissue, and they can look at one gene or multiple genes at the same time. Genetic testing may&#xD;
      change the options for treating people with certain types of cancer. For example, some&#xD;
      medications are more helpful for the treatment of cancer in people with certain gene changes&#xD;
      (mutations).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers are doing this study to develop new educational materials about genetic&#xD;
      testing for people who speak different languages and have diverse cultural and educational&#xD;
      backgrounds. During the study, the staff will interview participants with diverse cultural&#xD;
      and educational backgrounds and ask them to review a sample of the educational materials that&#xD;
      have been developed so far. Participants will give their opinions on these materials, and the&#xD;
      researchers will use participants' feedback to improve the materials.&#xD;

    <description>There is no treatment or intervention for Phase 1 of this study. Participants will be asked to participate in a cognitive interview.&#xD;
This section will be amended to include the Phase 2 intervention information once the Phase 1 portion of the study is complete. The Phase 1 materials developed, and results obtained, will directly be part of and inform the intervention for Phase 2.</description>

    <description>Researchers will use formative methods to adapt our previously-developed mainstreaming pre-genetic test educational materials plus standard post-test clinical communication materials used by the MSK CGS for use with the diverse patients. Specifically, it will adapt these materials to be responsive to patients' linguistic and literacy needs, and sensitive to their cultural diversity.</description>
