    <textblock>
      This Study will investigate the bioavailability in fasting subjects of 1 capsule formulation&#xD;
      containing Duloxetine 60 mg. The Study will be performed at a single site with 36&#xD;
      subjects.Participants will take 1 capsule of the test product and reference product in 2&#xD;
      periods and 2 sequences (either test after reference or reference after test). There will be&#xD;
      a washout of at least 14 days between each study period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to investigate the relative bioavailability of&#xD;
      Duloxetine of 1 capsule formulation with Duloxetine 60 mg under feeding conditions to&#xD;
      demonstrate bioequivalence of both formulations in terms of rate and extent of absorption:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Test Product: Product manufactured by Laboratorios Andr√≥maco S.A.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reference Product: Cymbalta[Trademark], product of Eli Lilly, Puerto Rico.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 90% confidence intervals for the intra-subject coefficient of variation (Test versus&#xD;
      Reference Product) for the main pharmacokinetic parameters area under the plasma&#xD;
      concentrationtime curve from time zero to time t (AUC0-t) and from time zero to 72 hours&#xD;
      (AUC0-72), and maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) for total Duloxetine will be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be confined in the study site for approximately 25,5 hours during each&#xD;
      study period (for 10 hours pre-dosing and for 15,5 hours post dosing) during which&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic (PK) blood samples will be obtained. 17 blood samples will be taken up to 24&#xD;
      hours after the administration in each period. Participants will return to the site to&#xD;
      provide additional blood samples at 48 h, and 72 h postdose.The washout period between the&#xD;
      two study periods will be at least 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The samples from each participant will be analyzed with 2 methods of high performance liquid&#xD;
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry bioanalytical assays to quantify total Duloxetine in&#xD;
      plasma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety objective is to evaluate the tolerability of both formulations in subjects by&#xD;
      collecting adverse events.&#xD;
