      This study plans to enroll several patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia,&#xD;
      randomly assigned to different dose groups, and randomly receiving subcutaneous injection of&#xD;
      IBI306150 mg or placebo every two weeks: or subcutaneous injection of IBI306 450mg every four&#xD;
      weeks (n=49) or placebo (n=25) treatment, treatment lasted for 12 weeks. During&#xD;
      randomization, the LDL-C level (&lt;4.8mmol/L or ≥4.8mmol/L) observed during the screening&#xD;
      period visit (VI), and whether ezetimibe was used for stratification. After 12 weeks, each&#xD;
      group entered the 12-week open-period treatment, in which subjects in the IBI306 group&#xD;
      continued to receive IBI306 treatment, and subjects in the placebo group stopped using&#xD;
      placebo and received IBI306 treatment. The exploratory endpoint is the population&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic characteristics of IBI306 in Chinese heterozygous familial&#xD;
      hypercholesterolemia population.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study plans to enroll 148 patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, and&#xD;
      maintain a low-fat diet and stably take the current anterior-lowering therapy for at least 4&#xD;
      weeks. Randomly enter different dose groups at 1:1. 2: 1 randomized to receive subcutaneous&#xD;
      injection of IBI306150 mg (n=49) or placebo (n=25) every two weeks: or subcutaneous injection&#xD;
      of IBI306 450mg (n=49) or placebo (n=25) every four weeks , The treatment lasted 12 weeks.&#xD;
      During randomization, the LDL-C level (&lt;4.8mmol/L or ≥4.8mmol/L) observed during the&#xD;
      screening period visit (VI), and whether ezetimibe was used for stratification. After 12&#xD;
      weeks, each group entered the 12-week open-period treatment, in which subjects in the IBI306&#xD;
      group continued to receive IBI306 treatment, and subjects in the placebo group stopped using&#xD;
      placebo and received IBI306 treatment. The primary endpoint was the percentage change in&#xD;
      LDL-C levels from baseline at 12 weeks. The secondary endpoints were the changes in blood&#xD;
      lipid levels from baseline at 12 and 24 weeks, drug safety, and immunogenicity. The&#xD;
      exploratory endpoint is the population pharmacokinetic characteristics of IBI306 in Chinese&#xD;
      heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia population. If necessary, the dose of IBI306 will&#xD;
      be adjusted according to the results of the ongoing multi-dose climbing study. After the open&#xD;
      period, the subjects will undergo an 8-week safety visit.&#xD;
