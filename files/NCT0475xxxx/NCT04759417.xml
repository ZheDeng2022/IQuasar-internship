  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: The STONE score has traditionally been used as a clinical prediction tool to&#xD;
      predict the presence of ureteric stones in patients presenting with renal colic. More&#xD;
      recently, the CHOKAI score was introduced and found to have superior diagnostic accuracy on&#xD;
      both internal and external validation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: Our study aims to externally validate and compare the use of both the CHOKAI and&#xD;
      STONE score in a population of UAE patients presenting to the Emergency Department for renal&#xD;
      colic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Over a period of approximately 6 months, the study will follow Emergency Department&#xD;
      Physicians at each institution and retrieve data from their encounters with patients&#xD;
      presenting with renal colic. Parameters for both CHOKAI and STONE scores will be logged,&#xD;
      extracted and matched against a reference standard of CT scan to compare diagnostic accuracy&#xD;
      of both scores to predict the presence of ureteric stones in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goals: Evaluation of the findings will discern applicability of scores to the UAE population&#xD;
      and contribute to reducing unnecessary radiation exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To our knowledge, no studies have compared the use of these scores to diagnose urolithiasis&#xD;
      in the United Arab Emirates. Furthermore, this will be the first study to externally validate&#xD;
      the CHOKAI score outside of Japan using a controlled, prospective design.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over a period of approximately 6 months, the study will follow Emergency Department&#xD;
      Physicians at each of three separate institutions and retrieve data from their encounters&#xD;
      with patients presenting with renal colic. Parameters for both CHOKAI and STONE scores will&#xD;
      be logged, extracted and matched against a reference standard of CT scan to compare&#xD;
      diagnostic accuracy of both scores to predict the presence of ureteric stones in this&#xD;
      population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Full-time ED Physicians from each institution will be recruited to participate in the study&#xD;
      as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each ED Physician shall be provided with Data Collection Sheet. This form will provide them&#xD;
      with a standardized option to enter the components of the STONE and CHOKAI score using data&#xD;
      normally conducted in the history taking and physical examination of patients suspected to&#xD;
      have ureteric stones. Additional items have also been included to investigate for other&#xD;
      variables that could influence clinical prediction of presence of ureteric stones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those patients suspected to have ureteric stones will have confirmation of urolithiasis by&#xD;
      non-contrast CT scan. Though the investigators will log the data in their respective data&#xD;
      collection sheets per patient, they will not be involved in entering this data onto the&#xD;
      study's database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected for a period of approximately 6 months from February 1, 2021 onward,&#xD;
      with a target sample size of 200 patients.&#xD;
