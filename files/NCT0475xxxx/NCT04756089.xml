    <textblock>
      This is a pilot feasibility and acceptability study of a randomized clinical trial of&#xD;
      pregnant women at 36 weeks of gestation and greater randomized to one of two arms at Yale New&#xD;
      Haven Hospital: (1) Breast stimulation by hand or with an electronic breast pump&#xD;
      (intervention) compared to (2) Exogenous oxytocin intravenous infusion (current standard of&#xD;
      care, control). The pilot study will be randomized since one of the goals is to evaluate&#xD;
      whether the idea of randomization would be acceptable to patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Almost four million women give birth each year in the United States with more than 27% of&#xD;
      them undergoing induction of labor. Generally, labor induction is indicated when the benefits&#xD;
      of expeditious delivery outweigh the risks of continuing the pregnancy. Additionally, labor&#xD;
      induction is increasingly seen as a potentially therapeutic intervention even in the absence&#xD;
      of any pregnancy complication for nulliparas after 39 weeks of gestation. However, induction&#xD;
      of labor is usually associated with a longer latent phase compared to spontaneous labor, and&#xD;
      may result in the need for cesarean delivery at an individual level when an induction attempt&#xD;
      fails. Furthermore, it has been shown that women who are induced are less likely to be&#xD;
      satisfied with their birth experience compared to those with spontaneous labor. Women are&#xD;
      increasingly interested in a less medicalized birth experience and desire more control during&#xD;
      their labor process. Lastly, the cost and infrastructure that would be required to&#xD;
      universally apply routine induction of labor at 39 weeks of gestation are frequently cited as&#xD;
      prohibitive, despite its associated improved outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breast stimulation has been purported as a natural and inexpensive non-medical method for&#xD;
      inducing labor that may give patients greater control over the process and have other&#xD;
      potential clinical benefits. It is thought that breast stimulation induces uterine&#xD;
      contractility by increasing the level of endogenous oxytocin hormone. Breast stimulation was&#xD;
      historically used successfully for inducing contractions for the purposes of contraction&#xD;
      stress testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Cochrane review was performed in 2010 that compared breast stimulation with either no&#xD;
      intervention or oxytocin infusion for labor induction. They found a significant reduction in&#xD;
      the number of women not in labor at 72 hours (62.7% vs. 93.6%, RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.60-0.74) and&#xD;
      the incidence of postpartum hemorrhage (0.7% vs. 6%, RR 0.16, 95% CI 0.03-0.87) among those&#xD;
      who underwent breast stimulation compared to those who did not receive any intervention for&#xD;
      induction. There were no benefits seen when comparing women who underwent breast stimulation&#xD;
      versus those who received oxytocin alone. Despite the promising findings, the Cochrane Review&#xD;
      raised the possibility of safety concerns due to one trial that reported four perinatal&#xD;
      deaths (three in the breast stimulation group and one in the oxytocin group). However, that&#xD;
      study was conducted in India, women were not monitored during breast stimulation, there was&#xD;
      no clearly reported method of randomization, and there were very few study details divulged.&#xD;
      The Cochrane Review ultimately had limited conclusions for several reasons. First, most&#xD;
      included studies compared breast stimulation to no intervention, which is not the appropriate&#xD;
      alternative when it has been determined that a labor induction is indicated. Additionally,&#xD;
      most studies involved breast stimulation by hand at home for 1-3 hours per day and included&#xD;
      only women with &quot;low-risk&quot; or un-specified risk pregnancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only one previous trial has tested breast stimulation by breast pump, which showed that the&#xD;
      time to reach the active phase of labor was significantly reduced among women who underwent&#xD;
      breast stimulation compared to those who received oxytocin in the hospital setting. There was&#xD;
      no difference in the length of labor between groups once women were considered to be in the&#xD;
      active phase of labor or mode of delivery, but the trial included just 62 women.&#xD;
      Reassuringly, only one of the 30 women assigned to breast stimulation requested&#xD;
      discontinuation due to nipple soreness after 5.5 hours of intermittent stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breast stimulation by hand or with an electronic breast pump is a biologically plausible&#xD;
      method of labor induction that can potentially allow labor induction to be more efficient and&#xD;
      may also have other benefits. These may include effects related to improved uterine&#xD;
      contractility (e.g., successful labor induction and decreased postpartum hemorrhage risk),&#xD;
      patient satisfaction with the induction process, and the stimulation of endogenous oxytocin&#xD;
      which may improve postpartum breastfeeding and positive emotional responses. A well-designed&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial is needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of breast&#xD;
      stimulation, particularly in comparison to the clinical alternative (use of exogenous&#xD;
      oxytocin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a proposed prospective parallel group randomized controlled external pilot study of&#xD;
      breast stimulation by hand or with an electronic breast pump compared to exogenous oxytocin&#xD;
      infusion to assess acceptability and feasibility prior to conducting a large non-inferiority&#xD;
      randomized trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two arms in this study are: (1) Breast stimulation by hand or with an electronic breast&#xD;
      pump (intervention) compared to (2) Exogenous oxytocin intravenous infusion (current standard&#xD;
      of care, control).&#xD;
