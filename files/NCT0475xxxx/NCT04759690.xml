  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With aging, the decrease in muscle strength in the musculoskeletal system , body biomechanics&#xD;
      and posture changes and the risk of falling increase. The greatest danger of falling in this&#xD;
      population is risky and the other danger is that it causes fractures, creates physical and&#xD;
      psychological trauma, and increases the need for long-term care and health services.&#xD;
      Increasing exercise efficiency for balance and preventing falls are extremely important for&#xD;
      physical and cognitive health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      İn recent years ,the''Action Observation''approach has been used as an added method to&#xD;
      treatments to increase the effectiveness of exercise.Action observation ; it is a cognitive&#xD;
      training that triggers motor learning by observing the desired activity and positively&#xD;
      affects learning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study : To investigate the effects of exercises on balance and fall risk&#xD;
      together with action observation in individuals over 65 years of age . The researchers&#xD;
      planned to combine action observation and traditional balance exercises as a group training&#xD;
      and compare them with the control group .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of the research is that action observation(AO) will be more useful in&#xD;
      maintaining balance and preventing the risk of falling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods of the research:Participants will consist of volunteers over 65 years&#xD;
      of age . 38 participants to be selected randomly. The participants will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental group :( 19 participants ) Action observation+ exercise combination Control&#xD;
      group :( 19 participants ) will only exercise Study protocol:The randomized experimental and&#xD;
      control group will study 3 days per week for a total of 8 weeks .Exercises difficulty;Borg&#xD;
      Scale(0-10):It will be modarate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation:All evaluations will be made as a Pre-test/Post-test. The detailed descriptions&#xD;
      and characteristics of the participants will be summarized at baseline and after 8 weeks, and&#xD;
      the differences between groups, intergroup differences will be statistically evaluated.&#xD;

      Purpose of the research:To investigate the effects of exercises combined with action&#xD;
      observation on balance and fall risk in individuals over 65 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of the research is that action observation will be more useful in maintaining&#xD;
      balance and preventing the risk of failling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Action observation therapy (AOT)is a novel rehabilitation technique, which involves&#xD;
      observation of purposeful actions with the intention to imitate and then performing those&#xD;
      actions. AOT can be described as the patient being asked to carefully observe actions&#xD;
      presented through a video-clip or performed by an operator, in order to imitate, try, and&#xD;
      execute them after observation .This may include the mirror neuron system (MNS) processes on&#xD;
      the upper limb function resulting from the observation of actions (new motor skills) and&#xD;
      actual execution of similar neural structures . Current evidence have been limited to&#xD;
      investigating AOT effectiveness on upper and lower limb rehabilitation in both neurological&#xD;
      and orthopedic disorders, patients with stroke and brain injuries, limb pain, Parkinson&#xD;
      disease, and in the old women. However, despite the volume of our understanding, there is a&#xD;
      dearth of current scientific evidence evaluating the efficacy of AOT combined with exercises&#xD;
      on balance and risk of fall in elderly both in men and women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Power Analysis:The effect size was calculated using the G Power Package Program(G Power&#xD;
      3.0.10) over the data of the reference article(Leem SH et al,2019).The sample size required&#xD;
      for the study according to the calculated effect size was determined as 38 participants for&#xD;
      %95 power and Type I error rate (alpha):0.05 were calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly divided into two groups as experimental and control groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental group participants:(n=19) Action observation+ exercise combination Control group&#xD;
      participants:(n=19) Only exercise&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental group , the participants will be asked to carefully observe actions presented&#xD;
      through a video-clip exercise for 15 minutes, and then do same exercises for about 30 minutes&#xD;
      in 8-10 repetitions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Control group (only exercise group), the participants will perform exercises for about 30&#xD;
      minutes in 8-10 repetitions without a video-clip observation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study program:3 days a week for 8 weeks Exercise difficulty:Borg Scale(0-10); it will be&#xD;
      moderate. Exercise program:Exercises will be easy to learn but not complex in terms of recall&#xD;
      and performans. Depending on the fitness of the person, %50-75 of the maximum heart rate&#xD;
      (220-years),the exercise intensity will be preferred over the Borg Scale.&#xD;
