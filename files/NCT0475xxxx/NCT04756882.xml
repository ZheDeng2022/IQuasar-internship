    <textblock>
      Background: Scars widen when the overlying musculature pulls apart suture lines. Because&#xD;
      Botulinum Toxin A (BTA) is known to prevent fibroblast proliferation and it also induces&#xD;
      temporary muscle paralysis, the purpose of this current study is to evaluate the beneficial&#xD;
      effects of Botulinum toxin type A (BTA) on scar formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of this study: The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of early&#xD;
      postoperative Botulinum Toxin type A (BTA) injection on improving vertical or oblique facial&#xD;
      surgical scars.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods: Patients with vertical or oblique forehead lacerations, treated by&#xD;
      primary closure, will be enrolled in this study and randomized into two groups: One group (n&#xD;
      =6) will receive BTA injection within 5 days of primary closure and the other group (n = 6)&#xD;
      will receive no further treatment. Vancouver scar scale (VSS) Scores and wound width will be&#xD;
      determined at the 1, 3 and 6 months follow-up visits, along with clinical photographs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results: Data will be collected, tabulated and statically analyzed. Key words: Botulinum&#xD;
      Toxin Type A; facial scarring; wound healing; scar maturation&#xD;

      1. All procedures were performed under local anesthesia in Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery&#xD;
           Department, Alexandria University.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Using nonalcoholic solution after makeup removal, a single surgeon performed the&#xD;
           procedures under complete aseptic technique (Lee, Min et al. 2018).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. All patients wore a disposable cap to contain hair.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. We examined before treatment: the facial anatomy, mimic muscular contraction, facial&#xD;
           expression, and any pre-existing asymmetry(Wilson 2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Immediately after taking the photographs, both the length and width of the forehead&#xD;
           wound were measured directly on the patients using a digital vernier caliper by a single&#xD;
           plastic surgeon blinded to the study condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Pain at the injected sites was minimized before each injection by applying topical&#xD;
           anesthetics and cold iced devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Micro fine 1.0 ml insulin syringes with a 29-G or 30-G needle were used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. The dosages of the preparations are related to biological activity and are given in&#xD;
           biological units (U). The units are termed according to the manufacturer as Speywood U&#xD;
           (SU) for Dysport&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. The drugs used were AboBotulinumToxin A Dysport (500 Speywood U) is to be reconstituted&#xD;
           with 2.0 mL of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) injection solution. This results in a&#xD;
           clear solution containing the 500 Speywood units of the active ingredient in a&#xD;
           concentration of 250 units per 1.0 mL of the reconstituted solution. The reconstitution&#xD;
           is to be performed in accordance with the rules of good clinical practice, particularly&#xD;
           with respect to asepsis and within 15 day of reconstitutin.(Hexsel, Rutowitsch et al.&#xD;
           2009, Scaglione 2016, Lee, Min et al. 2018).&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. The total dose is approximately 105 SU.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. The total dose is divieded into 75 SU injected by a (1-ml, , 30-gauge needle) insulin&#xD;
           syringe along the scar length at the rate of approximately 12.5 SU (0.15 ml) per cm of&#xD;
           wound length, in a linear pattern on either side of the wound. , with the needle prick&#xD;
           positined approximately 5 mm from the edge of the wound, The injection was repeated&#xD;
           every cm throughout the entire wound length and 30 SU are injected into frontalis&#xD;
           muscle.(Wilson 2006, Hu, Zou et al. 2018, Kim, Lee et al. 2019)&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. Injections were determined by a skin marker and done under the supervision of a&#xD;
           qualified licensed supervisor.&#xD;
&#xD;
       13. due to muscles contraction The injections were carried out on skin folds and are&#xD;
           performed at different levels (intramuscular, subcutaneous, or intradermal) in more&#xD;
           points for each region. The injections were administrated directly into the point of&#xD;
           intense muscular contraction. On the other hand, where the contraction was weak, the&#xD;
           injection was done at a deep or superficial intradermal level. Depth depends also on the&#xD;
           effect we want to achieve: an extreme effect for intramuscular, a soft effect for&#xD;
           subcutaneous or intradermal.(Iozzo, Tengattini et al. 2014)&#xD;
&#xD;
       14. To prevent eyebrow ptosis, the drugs were not injected around the supraorbital rim.(Kim,&#xD;
           Lee et al. 2019).&#xD;

    <description>Anaerobic fermentation of the bacterium Clostridium botulinum produces botulinum toxin. A range of different C. Botulinum strains have been recognized; eight immunologically different serotypes (type A-H) are created and consist of botulinum neurotoxin complexed with a number of related proteins.&#xD;
Neurotoxin type A preparations are the most widely used for therapeutic application. There are currently three leading botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNT/A) products on the market in the Western Hemisphere: onabotulinumtoxinA (ONA; Botox/Vistabel, Allergan Inc., Irvine, CA, USA), abobotulinum toxin A (ABO; Dysport/Ipsen Limited, Slough Berkshire, UK), and incobotulinum toxin A (INCO; Xeomin/Bocouture, Merz Pharmaceuticals GmbH, Frankfurt, Germany). In nature, BoNT-A is synthesized as macromolecular protein complexes</description>
