  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective, monocentric study involving 50 patients with pancreatic&#xD;
      neuroendocrine neoplasia resected between January 2008 and June 2020 at Paoli Calmettes&#xD;
      Institute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the grade concordance rate, based on Ki67&#xD;
      obtained on the pre-operative micro-biopsy and the surgical specimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the histology slides obtained in the course of the treatment, several Ki67 recounts&#xD;
      will be performed on pre-operative tumor micro-biopsies and on tumors resected after surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a manual count (on photo printed in the hotspot area according to World Health&#xD;
           Organization (WHO) 2017 recommendations, by an expert pathologist and a junior&#xD;
           pathologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Automated counting using specific software based on artificial intelligence (Qpath&#xD;
           software).&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, clinical, surgical and anatomopathological data will be collected in order&#xD;
      to follow the patient evolution.&#xD;
