      This is a Phase I, open-label, dose-escalation, single arm study to explore the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, and preliminary clinical activity of agenT-797, an unmodified, allogeneic iNKT&#xD;
      cell therapy, in subjects with relapsed/refractory MM, as well as define the RP2D.&#xD;

      This is a Phase I, open-label, dose-escalation, single arm study to explore the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, and preliminary clinical activity of agenT-797, an unmodified, allogeneic iNKT&#xD;
      cell therapy, in subjects with relapsed/refractory MM, as well as define the RP2D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part 1, the study will employ a standard 3+3 dose escalation design, for which 3 to 6&#xD;
      evaluable subjects (maximally 9 if recommended by the Safety Review Committee [SRC]) will be&#xD;
      enrolled at each assigned dose level, per cohort depending on the occurrence of DLTs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 will consist of one or more cohorts of in total up to around 6 to 12 subjects with&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory MM who receive agenT-797 at a given dose after lymphodepletion and will&#xD;
      employ a 3+3 dose escalation/de-escalation design depending on the occurrence of DLTs. The&#xD;
      starting dose in Part 2 will be equal to the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) defined in Part 1&#xD;
      in the absence of any DLTs at that dose level. If a DLT is observed at the MTD in Part 1, the&#xD;
      starting dose level in Part 2 will be the dose level below MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Details of the analyses will be described in a statistical analysis plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Safety Monitoring Committee will be established to assess safety and decide on escalation&#xD;
      to next Cohort.&#xD;
