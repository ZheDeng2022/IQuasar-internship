  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase II trial is to see how well single agent chemotherapy and pembrolizumab work&#xD;
      elderly patients (≥ 75 years) with advanced non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Pembrolizumab&#xD;
      stimulates your immune system to help fight lung cancer. This treatment approach may be&#xD;
      better tolerated in elderly patients.&#xD;

      Primary Objective(s), Hypothesis(es), and Endpoint(s)&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of single agent chemotherapy and pembrolizumab in&#xD;
      elderly (≥ 75 years) advanced NSCLC patients Hypothesis: We propose that single agent&#xD;
      chemotherapy with pembrolizumab will be better tolerated and will provide similar efficacy as&#xD;
      platinum-based combination chemotherapy with pembrolizumab in advanced elderly (≥75 years)&#xD;
      NSCLC patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess median PFS in elderly (≥ 75 years) advanced NSCLC patients with tumor PD-L1 (&lt;50%)&#xD;
      treated with pemetrexed or nab-paclitaxel and pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective(s), Hypothesis(es), and Endpoint(s)&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Objective: To assess additional measure of efficacy of the regimen. To define the toxicity&#xD;
      of the regimen in addition&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Hypothesis: In this patient population single agent chemotherapy and pembrolizumab will&#xD;
      provide similar efficacy but improved tolerability as 2 drug combination with pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess overall survival in the study population II. Assess the toxicities with the study&#xD;
      therapy and the rate of discontinuation of study therapy due to toxicities related to study&#xD;
      therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Objective: To define correlatives that can identify patients most likely to benefit from&#xD;
      the study therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Correlate PFS with blood-based tumor mutational burden and ctDNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who experience confirmed disease progression or start a new anticancer therapy,&#xD;
      will move into the Survival Follow-Up Phase and should be contacted by telephone every 12&#xD;
      weeks to assess for survival status until death, withdrawal of consent, or the end of the&#xD;
      trial, whichever occurs first.&#xD;

             Calmette-Guérin (BCG), and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection&#xD;
             are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza&#xD;
             vaccines (eg, FluMist®) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Is currently participating in or has participated in a study of an investigational&#xD;

             cancers&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Has symptomatic CNS metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Subjects with&#xD;
             asymptomatic brain metastases may participate provided they are clinically stable and&#xD;
             are not using steroids equivalent to &gt;10mg of prednisone day prior to trial treatment.&#xD;
             This exception does not include carcinomatous meningitis which is excluded regardless&#xD;
             of whether it is symptomatic or not.&#xD;

             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive&#xD;
             drugs). Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid&#xD;
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a&#xD;
             form of systemic treatment and is allowed.&#xD;

             reactive) or known active Hepatitis C virus (defined as HCV RNA [qualitative] is&#xD;
             detected) infection. Note: no testing for Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C is required&#xD;
             unless mandated by local health authority.&#xD;

             that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the subject's&#xD;
             participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of&#xD;
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with&#xD;
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.&#xD;
