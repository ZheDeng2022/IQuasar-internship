  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spatial neglect is a common post-stroke condition in which people may not be aware of&#xD;
      anything on one side of the world (usually the same side they lost their movement).&#xD;
      Currently, there is no effective treatment for spatial neglect. A therapy called SIGHT&#xD;
      (Spatial Inattention Grasping Home-based Therapy) has shown early evidence of improving&#xD;
      stroke survivors' spatial neglect (Rossit et al., 2019). SIGHT involves individuals&#xD;
      picking-up and balance wooden rods with their less affected hand, independently, without the&#xD;
      need for a therapist present at all times. Working with stroke survivors, carers and&#xD;
      clinicians we have developed of a computerized version of SIGHT (c-SIGHT; Morse et al., in&#xD;
      press). The present trial aims to: 1) investigate the feasibility of a blinded randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial of c-SIGHT (active intervention) vs. an attentional control training version&#xD;
      of c-SIGHT (sham intervention) in the homes of stroke survivors with spatial neglect; 2)&#xD;
      Explore participant's experience using c-SIGHT independently at home; and 3) Explore the&#xD;
      potential effects and effect size of c-SIGHT active intervention compared to the attentional&#xD;
      control training to inform a future Phase II trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-centre, two-arm blinded feasibility clinical trial with an embedded&#xD;
      qualitative study. Following baseline assessment, participants will be randomized (using&#xD;
      minimization) to either: active vs. sham version of computerised Spatial Inattention Grasping&#xD;
      Home-based Therapy (c-SIGHT). Randomization and group allocation will be managed and run by&#xD;
      Norwich Clinical Trials Unit (independent from research team and outcome assessors).&#xD;
      Participants, carers, outcome assessors, clinical care team and research team will be blinded&#xD;
      to participant group allocation. Participants allocated to the active intervention c-SIGHT&#xD;
      group will be required to lift and balance three wooden rods of different lengths. Those in&#xD;
      the attentional control c-SIGHT group will use the same equipment, but will be required to&#xD;
      lift the rods from one end only and not attempt to balance them (an attentional control).&#xD;
      During the first training session a therapist (independent from the outcome assessors) will&#xD;
      set-up the equipment and train the participant to self-administer the relevant version of&#xD;
      c-SIGHT independently (i.e., without the presence of a therapist). Following this training&#xD;
      session, participants will self-administer the training for 10 consecutive days&#xD;
      (thirty-minute sessions 2 times a day - 'Training phase'). On the last day of the training&#xD;
      (day 10) the therapist will return to participant's homes to complete a monitoring visit and&#xD;
      collect equipment. To monitor adherence and therapy compliance the therapist will collect&#xD;
      photos and videos of the first and last session of the training. A blinded assessor will&#xD;
      collect outcome assessments at the end of the training phase (T1) and at one-month&#xD;
      post-training (T2). The post-training (T1) data collection visit will also include one-to-one&#xD;
      semi-structured interviews with stroke survivor participants and their carers (qualitative&#xD;
      study).&#xD;

    <description>The Star Cancellation Test is a paper and pencil test developed to detect the presence of unilateral spatial neglect (USN) in the near extra personal space in patients with stroke.The maximum score that can be achieved on the test is 54 points. A cutoff of &lt; 51 indicates the presence of SN. A Laterality Index or Star Ratio will be calculated from the ratio of stars cancelled on the contralesional side of the page and the total number of stars cancelled. Scores between 0 and 0.46 indicate neglect in the left hemispace. Scores between 0.54 and 1 indicate neglect in the right hemispace.This will be completed by stroke survivors only.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (T0, before intervention), post-training (T1, after 10 days of intervention) and at follow-up (T2, after 1 month post-training)</time_frame>
    <description>The SIS is a stroke-specific, self-report, health status measure. It was designed to assess multidimensional stroke outcomes, including strength, hand function Activities of Daily Living / Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (ADL/IADL), mobility, communication, emotion, memory and thinking, and participation. An extra question on stroke recovery asks that the client rate on a scale from 0 - 100 how much the client feels that he/she has recovered from his/her stroke. Each item is rated using a 5-point Likert scale. Scoring will be computed for each domain and total according to scoring database: http://www.kumc.edu/school-of-medicine/population-health/research-and-community-engagement/stroke-impact-scale/instructions.html.

    <description>The Catherine Bergego Scale is a standardized checklist to detect presence and degree of unilateral neglect during everyday life situations. The CBS uses a 4-point rating scale to report the frequency (e.g., Never, occasionally, frequently, always) of each statement occurring (e.g., &quot;Forgets to groom/shave the left/right part of this/her face&quot;).

    <description>To assess usability of c-SIGHT. Participants are asked to score the following 10 items with one of five responses that range from Strongly Agree to Strongly disagree. The participant's scores for each question are converted to a new number, added together and then multiplied by 2.5 to convert the original scores of 0-40 to 0-100. Though the scores are 0-100, these are not percentages and should be considered only in terms of their percentile ranking. Based on previous research, a SUS score above 68 would be considered above average and anything below 68 is below average. This scale will be completed by the stroke survivor and carer (if available) separately.</description>
