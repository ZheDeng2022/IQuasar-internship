  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of a novel Platform Wound Device (PWD) in&#xD;
      its delivery of a local antibiotic, 0.1% Gentamycin cream, to prevent or treat infection in&#xD;
      torso and extremity wounds. The hypothesis is that the PWD will be a safe and effective&#xD;
      method to provide topical antibiotics to a torso or extremity wound, non-inferior to the&#xD;
      current standard of care. This treatment will reduce or rapidly eradicate infection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial comparing the use of a platform&#xD;
      wound device as compared to standard of care to prevent or eliminate infection in torso and&#xD;
      extremity wounds. Patients 18-85 years of age admitted for treatment of open wound(s) will be&#xD;
      screened for inclusion criteria and asked to consent to participate in the randomized study.&#xD;
      The first 10 patients will be treated with the PWD + gentamicin and will serve as a safety&#xD;
      subset. Baseline measurement of serum antibiotic concentraion will be taken prior to PWD&#xD;
      placement and one day after. Following the safety subset, 50 patients will be randomized to&#xD;
      standard of care or to a single application of the PWD + gentamicin. Baseline assessments&#xD;
      will be completed on day 0, including screening, pre-procedure wound evaluation, imaging,&#xD;
      assessments, and specimen collection. Follow-up assessments will be completed and data&#xD;
      gathered at days 1,2,3 and 4. All data collected of the study participants will be used to&#xD;
      evaluate the PWD delivery of antibiotic.&#xD;
