  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of AloCELYVIR, which consist in&#xD;
      bone marrow-derived allogenic mesenchymal stem cells infected with an oncolytic Adenovirus,&#xD;
      ICOVIR-5. It has recently been proven that this type of cells are able of transporting&#xD;
      oncolytic substances to tumor targets that are difficult to reach, such as medulloblastomas&#xD;
      and gliomas, youth cancers located in the cranial cavity that have a poor prognosis and a&#xD;
      fatal outcome. In addition, to exerting an anti-tumor action, this virus has the ability to&#xD;
      stimulate the immune response, making the therapy even more effective. Thus, the diffuse&#xD;
      intrinsic pontine glioma and the medulloblastoma in relapse/progression have been chosen to&#xD;
      study the potential of this new advanced therapy through a weekly infusion for 8 weeks.&#xD;
