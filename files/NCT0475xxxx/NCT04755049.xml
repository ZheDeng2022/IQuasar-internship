    <textblock>
      Background: The patient self-report section of the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons&#xD;
      Standardized Shoulder Assessment Form (ASESp) is one of the most validated and reliable&#xD;
      assessment tools. This study aimed to establish a validated Chinese version of ASESp&#xD;
      (ASESp-CH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A clinical prospective study was performed. Following the guidelines of&#xD;
      forward-backward translation and cross-cultural adaptation, a Chinese version of ASESp was&#xD;
      established. Patients older than 18 years with shoulder disorders were included. Patients who&#xD;
      could not complete test-retest questionnaires within the interval of 7-30 days and patients&#xD;
      who received interventions were excluded. Intraclass correlation (ICC) was calculated for&#xD;
      test- retest reliability, whereas internal consistency was determined by Cronbach value.&#xD;
      Construct validity was evaluated by comparing the corresponding domains between the ASESp-CH&#xD;
      and a validated Chinese version of 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36).&#xD;
