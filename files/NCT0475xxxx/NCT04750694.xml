      Purpose of the study is: to investigate the effects of 8 weeks intervention of high intensity&#xD;
      resistance training(HIRT) combined with Blood Flow Restricted Exercise (BFRE) compared to&#xD;
      high intensity resistance training alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detailed Description: 30 elite handball players will be randomized into 2 groups of 15&#xD;
      participants each. Participants will be evaluated in the week before and the week after an&#xD;
      8-weeks training intervention with 2 weekly sessions. Based on their baseline muscle strength&#xD;
      the participants will be randomized into two groups: HIRT-BFRE or HIRT-HIRT. Participants in&#xD;
      both groups will perform a full-body training programme of HIRT. After the Full-body&#xD;
      programme, Back squat exercise with low intensity and Blood flow restriction will be&#xD;
      performed to the HIRT-BFRE group and back squat exercise with high intensity without blood&#xD;
      flow restriction will be performed by HIRT-HIRT. Evaluation protocol includes: muscle&#xD;
      strength measurement with 1 repetition maximum of Back squat and knee extension, muscle mass&#xD;
      with Dual-Energy X-ray absorptiometry, muscle thickness of the thigh with ultra sound&#xD;
      measurement, vertical jump height with linear Encoder, sprint performance with 30m sprint&#xD;
      time.&#xD;

    <description>A full-training programme with high intensity followed by back squat exercise with blood flow restriction. Inflatable cuffs will be placed proximally on both thighs. The cuff pressure will be 50% of individual arterial occlusion pressure and will be maintained during the rest intervals. Participants will perform 30, 15, 15 and 15 repetitions of 30% of 1 Repetition Maximum. Totally 75 repetitions will be performed. 45 seconds rest interval between sets will be given.</description>
