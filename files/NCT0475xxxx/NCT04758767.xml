  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma will be enrolled in a dose-escalation&#xD;
      phase receiving monotherapy CID-103. Once the recommended CID-103 dose and infusion duration&#xD;
      is known, additional patients will be enrolled in an expansion phase consisting of two&#xD;
      cohorts (anti-CD38 pretreated, and anti-CD38 treatment naïve). Patients will be treated until&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicities.&#xD;

      Dose escalation/infusion duration phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the CID-103 dose escalation/infusion duration phase, only patients diagnosed with&#xD;
      multiple myeloma who have relapsed or are refractory to at least two prior lines of therapy&#xD;
      including a proteasome inhibitor, an immunomodulatory agent and an anti-CD38 antibody will be&#xD;
      enrolled. Patients will receive monotherapy CID-103. Dose escalation decisions will be based&#xD;
      on dose-limiting toxicities; infusion duration decisions will be based on infusion-related&#xD;
      reactions. The dose taken forward into the expansion phase will be the RP2D determined in the&#xD;
      dose escalation phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expansion phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expansion phase consists of two specific cohorts of patients with relapsed/refractory&#xD;
      multiple myeloma: 1) Pretreated cohort having received previous treatment with an anti-CD38&#xD;
      antibody and 2) Naïve cohort in patients for whom an anti-CD38 antibody is unavailable. Eight&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled into each cohort, and if one or more responses is observed, that&#xD;
      cohort will be expanded to a total of 14 patients to further assess efficacy. Patients must&#xD;
      have had at least two prior systemic therapies (mono or combo), including a proteasome&#xD;
      inhibitor and an immunomodulatory agent. Patients will be treated until disease progression&#xD;
      or unacceptable toxicities.&#xD;
