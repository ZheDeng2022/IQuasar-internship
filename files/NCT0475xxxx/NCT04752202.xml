  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hashimoto's disease is listed among the most common endocrine causes of obesity. As treatment&#xD;
      of obesity in women with Hashimoto's disease is frequently unsuccessful, the aim of this&#xD;
      study was to evaluate the effectiveness of two different reducing diets and their influence&#xD;
      on changes in thyroid parameters in the female patients. A six-month&#xD;
      observational/interventional study was performed on 100 women aged 18-65 years, previously&#xD;
      diagnosed with Hashimoto's disease and obesity and receiving L-thyroxine. The women were&#xD;
      randomly assigned to the test group (group A, n=50) following elimination/reducing diets, and&#xD;
      the control group (group B, n=50) following reducing diets with the same caloric content&#xD;
      (without elimination). Anthropometric and thyroid parameters were evaluated at the beginning,&#xD;
      after 3 months and after 6 months of treatment.&#xD;

    <description>Participants received diets in the range of 1400-1600 kcal/day (with a deficit of about 1000 kcal/day, depending on the resting metabolism and energy expenditure during the day). At the initial visit and every subsequent month, the women received individually balanced elimination/reducing diets, in accordance with the previously performed food sensitivity tests for 6 months. Laboratory tests for type III food sensitivity in the IgG1-3 class using the ELISA method were performed in an accredited medical laboratory. Diets were designed by a qualified dietitian using the Aliant (Poland) diet calculator. Each diet had the same macronutrient content - 25% protein, 30% fat, and 45% carbohydrate, and met the daily requirements for micro and macro elements for the given age group.</description>
