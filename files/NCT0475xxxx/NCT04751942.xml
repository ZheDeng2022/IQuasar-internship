      This prospective study will evaluate pain, swelling, ROM as well as narcotic use in&#xD;
      post-operative total knee arthroplasty patients using novel Non-Compressive Bioactive Garment&#xD;
      (NCBG) versus current standard of care gradient compression stocking&#xD;
      (Thrombo-Embolic-Deterrent or TED hose). If NCBG proves to be more effective in these outcome&#xD;
      areas, it will provide a new and comfortable way to reduce patient pain and swelling&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is one of the most popular surgical procedures today. It is&#xD;
      designed and proven to effectively reduce pain caused by end-stage osteoarthritis. Despite&#xD;
      its achievements, up to 25% of patients remain dissatisfied after the procedure due to&#xD;
      lingering pain, amongst other complaints. Post-operative swelling of the knee and leg is&#xD;
      thought to be a contributor to this persistent pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditionally, a standard gradient compression stocking is applied to the knee and leg after&#xD;
      surgery to reduce this pain and swelling. However, due to ineffectiveness or patient&#xD;
      non-compliance, compression stockings are often not entirely successful at preventing edema.&#xD;
      The recently developed NCPS is a lower extremity garment comprised of a technical fabric that&#xD;
      is thought to be able to prevent edema and reduce pain all in a comfortable, user-friendly&#xD;
      manner. The purpose of this study is to determine if the NCPS is effective at improving&#xD;
      post-operative pain, swelling, ROM and analgesic use associated with TKA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain and prolonged recovery time associated with post-operative swelling are two factors that&#xD;
      contribute to patient dissatisfaction following TKA. Swelling of the knee following TKA is&#xD;
      caused by intraarticular bleeding and inflammation of the periarticular tissues, which can&#xD;
      lead to a decrease in functional performance including pain and delayed rehabilitation. In a&#xD;
      study by Noble et al, 1/3 of dissatisfied patients reported that their knees swelled at least&#xD;
      once per week, leading to pain and discomfort1. Decreased quadriceps strength following knee&#xD;
      surgery has been shown to prolong recovery1-8. Fahrer et al showed that knee effusions&#xD;
      inhibited reflex neurons and altered kinetics and muscle activity in quadriceps, which&#xD;
      ultimately causes decreased strength2. Holm et al later showed us that knee swelling played a&#xD;
      part in post-operative quadriceps strength following TKA3. Ultimately, if post-operative&#xD;
      swelling can effectively be reduced, patient recovery could be expedited and patient&#xD;
      satisfaction could be improved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compression stockings have been utilized to attempt to reduce post-operative swelling.&#xD;
      Compression works to prevent swelling by reducing the hydrostatic pressure in the leg.&#xD;
      Reducing hydrostatic pressure prevents the capillaries from oozing and allows blood to move&#xD;
      freely from the superficial to the deep venous system, subsequently allowing excess fluid to&#xD;
      flow away from the interstitial space9.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More recently, the use of gradient compression stocking following TKA has come into question&#xD;
      for its efficacy. While the application of external pressure from these gradient compression&#xD;
      stocking is beneficial for a period, they are often unable to exert a sufficient amount of&#xD;
      pressure long enough to prevent painful edema for an extended amount of time. A study by&#xD;
      Bowling et al showed that these garments showed sufficient compression during the first few&#xD;
      hours after surgery, but the pressure they applied dropped with time and required daily&#xD;
      measurements and refitting to maintain appropriate and therapeutic compression10. This poses&#xD;
      a problem not only medically, but financially as well. These compression stockings lose their&#xD;
      fit so quickly, new ones must be prescribed frequently, leading to costly bills for the&#xD;
      patient. It's clear that compression stockings are not as effective as once thought when it&#xD;
      comes to controlling pain and swelling post-operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A potential solution to the problems posed by traditional compression stocking is the NCPG.&#xD;
      The garment is comprised of a semi-conductive material ground to nanoparticles that are&#xD;
      embedded into the fibers, formed into a three-dimensional woven fabric for optimized comfort.&#xD;
      Instead of relying on compression, NCPS utilizes the body's own thermal energy to generate&#xD;
      infrared energy. The infrared energy generated is reflected back at the body and modifies&#xD;
      cellular activity at the level of the mitochondria through a process known as&#xD;
      photobiomodulation14-15. This process of photobiomodulation is hypothesized to improve&#xD;
      swelling and tissue healing by increasing the activity of mitochondria and the availability&#xD;
      of cellular energy in the form of ATP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study seeks to determine if NCPS use of infrared energy is more successful at reducing&#xD;
      pain and swelling following TKA than traditional gradient compression dressing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will enroll 100 subjects throughout all sites involved in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited in the office setting after all non-operative modalities for&#xD;
      controlling pain associated with end-stage osteoarthritis of the knee have been exhausted.&#xD;
      Patients will then be presented with the option of total knee replacement. After patient has&#xD;
      agreed to undergo TKA, patients will then be asked (in a face-to-face setting) if they would&#xD;
      like to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be approached in the office setting after it has been determined that they have&#xD;
      failed conservative management of advanced knee arthritis. Patients will be in the surgeons'&#xD;
      clinic behind closed doors with the performing surgeon and potentially other members of the&#xD;
      research team. Consent will be obtained in the office after scheduling total knee&#xD;
      arthroplasty procedure. The consent process is expected to take 30 minutes, but more time is&#xD;
      available to ensure that patients have all their questions answered prior to signing the&#xD;
      consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be enrolled in study prior to surgery, outlined above in the consent process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day of surgery, patients will arrive and will be situated in the pre-operative holding&#xD;
      area. A trained member of the research team will meet the patient in the pre-operative&#xD;
      holding area and will measure the circumference of the patient's leg at the mid-thigh,&#xD;
      mid-knee and mid-calf. The patient's range of motion of the operative leg will be measured in&#xD;
      flexion and extension. All measurements will be recorded in redcap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will then go on to have their primary total knee arthroplasty by standard of care&#xD;
      procedure. Both cruciate retaining and posterior stabilized total knee replacement designs&#xD;
      will be included in the study. Following closure of the surgical site and placement of a&#xD;
      post-operative occlusive dressing, the operative leg will be measured once more for&#xD;
      circumference and range of motion, and the values will be entered into redcap. The patient&#xD;
      will then be placed in their randomized post-operative sleeve/device and will be transferred&#xD;
      to the PACU and will receive the standard post-operative treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On post-operative day one, patient's will be seen and evaluated in their inpatient rooms.&#xD;
      Their leg measurements will be taken again with the knee sleeve/compressive gradient dressing&#xD;
      pulled down. Patient's skin will be inspected for any reactions to the sleeve and a standard&#xD;
      post-operative examination will be performed to ensure no neurovascular compromise, blood&#xD;
      clots, infections or other post-operative complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will likely be discharged on post-operative day 1. Patients that have not been&#xD;
      discharged on post-operative day 1 will not be measured on post-operative day 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be provided with a journal that they will use every daily to track their pain&#xD;
      based on a visual analog scale and their narcotic consumption (number of Percocet or tramadol&#xD;
      pills). Patients will also use their journal to log the number of hours they wore their&#xD;
      sleeve each day. Patients will continue to log the number of pain medications taken and hours&#xD;
      wearing the sleeve for 6 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sleeves will be worn morning and night removing them only for hygiene and washing of sleeve&#xD;
      for 2 weeks. After 2 weeks, the patient's will wear the sleeve as much as they can tolerate&#xD;
      day and night. At 6 weeks, sleeves will be discontinued all together. Final ROM and&#xD;
      Circumference Measurements will be obtained at 12 weeks post-operative mark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be asked to fill out the Knee Society Score questionnaire at the time of&#xD;
      consent and at each post-operative visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Reparel leg sleeve is the experimental device being investigated in this study. It is&#xD;
      intended to improve swelling in the post-operative knee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allscripts Electronic Medical Records will be used to collect data about patients during&#xD;
      their inpatient, post-operative stay. UH Care ambulatory EMR and Medent EMR will be used in&#xD;
      the outpatient setting to collect data and track post-operative clinic visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The enrollment period will be 1 year from the time of the first patient enrolled in the&#xD;
      study. The enrollment period may be expanded to allow for the investigators to reach their&#xD;
      goal of 100 patients. The total amount of time each patient will be involved in the study&#xD;
      will be 12 weeks. Patients will only be required to wear the post-operative sleeve/dressing&#xD;
      for 6 weeks post-operatively. Patients will continue to record their narcotic consumption and&#xD;
      pain scores for 12 weeks post-operatively&#xD;
&#xD;
      Date to be collected:&#xD;

&#xD;
      Data Analysis Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographics will be reported using descriptives such as count data and percentages.&#xD;
      Differences between groups at baseline (pre-op) will be reported using two-tailed independent&#xD;
      t-tests for continuous variables, and chi-square or Fisher's Exact tests for categorical&#xD;
      data, as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcomes of range of motion, leg circumference, and pain ratings will be compared&#xD;
      post-op between conditions using two-tailed independent t-tests. Should clinically relevant&#xD;
      demographics differ significantly between conditions pre-op (baseline), post-op comparisons&#xD;
      will instead be conducted using one-way ANCOVAs controlling for differences at pre-op&#xD;
      (baseline). These comparisons will additionally be made at multiple additional time-points&#xD;
      throughout a 12-week post-op time period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A priori power analyses were calculated for two-tailed independent t-tests for each primary&#xD;
      outcome, using an alpha of .05, power = .80. Each of these are reported and the average of&#xD;
      these numbers is used to calculate the final sample size. Clinically significant reductions&#xD;
      in pain are defined as a 2-point change with a standard deviation of 2.5 using a 10-point&#xD;
      scale; 84 patients were estimated. Clinically significant changes in range of motion are&#xD;
      defined as: 10 degrees of difference from a 0-140 degree estimated range of values.&#xD;
      Clinically significant changes in leg circumference are defined as: 1 cm difference in leg&#xD;
      circumference using a 15-30 estimated range of values. To identify medium effect sizes of&#xD;
      .55, 106 patients were estimated. Averaging these values, 99 patients were estimated. To&#xD;
      ensure equal numbers of patients in each condition, 100 patients will be recruited for this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be monitored every 10 patients to assess for completeness, accuracy and&#xD;
      adherence to the protocol. We will also be monitoring for any obvious safety concerns that&#xD;
      may arise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will not be a designated safety team assigned.&#xD;
