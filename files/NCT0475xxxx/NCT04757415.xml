    <textblock>
      This study was a Randomized clinical trial conducted to determine the Effects of gluteal&#xD;
      activation with or without traction straight leg raise technique among patients of sacroiliac&#xD;
      joint syndrome so that in future this study will be helpful for other clinician to determine&#xD;
      that how much gluteal activation is important in low back pain or sacroiliac joint syndrome,&#xD;
      and how it affects our sling system.&#xD;

      Non Probability Convenient sampling was done . Patients following eligibility criteria from&#xD;
      Sports and Spine Professionals ,Lahore were considered. Sample size was calculated with Epi&#xD;
      tool calculator. 38 Participants were randomly allocated in two groups equally via convenient&#xD;
      sampling method. Baseline assessment was done initially. Group A was given gluteal activation&#xD;
      exercises with traction straight leg raise technique for hamstring and Group B was gluteal&#xD;
      activation exercises without traction straight leg raise technique for hamstring. Duration of&#xD;
      research was almost 6 months. Patient will undergo 10 treatments in five weeks. Each session&#xD;
      will take 30 minutes. Pre and Post treatment readings were taken in 1st and 10th session over&#xD;
      a 5 week period respectively. Assessment was done via sphygmomanometer and numeric pain&#xD;
      rating scale for assessing muscle strength of gluteus maximum and pain levels respectively.&#xD;
      All participants were provided written informed consent prior to commencement of the&#xD;
      procedures. They were free to quit the treatment at any stage of research. Data was analyzed&#xD;
      by using SPSS version 23.&#xD;

Each session took 30 minutes . Participants were treated 10 times over a 5 week period with 2 treatment sessions per week. Pre and Post treatment readings were taken in 1st and 10th session over a 5 week period respectively. Assessment was done via Numeric pain rating scale and sphygmomanometer for assessing pain intensity and muscle strength of gluteus maximus.</description>
