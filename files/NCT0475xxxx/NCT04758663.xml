  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research is to understand the role of sleep on memory function in early&#xD;
      childhood. Specifically, we seek to examine how promoted naps vs. promoted waking in habitual&#xD;
      and non-habitual napping children may impact overnight sleep physiology and subsequent memory&#xD;
      consolidation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With time spent awake, sleepiness increases (i.e., sleep pressure; Borbely, 1982). In young&#xD;
      adults, naps following sleep deprivation have significantly elevated slow wave activity (SWA;&#xD;
      1-4 Hz) relative to naps following normal overnight sleep (Werth et al., 1996). Similarly in&#xD;
      preschool children, overnight sleep following nap deprivation yields significantly greater&#xD;
      SWS relative to when a nap was taken earlier in the day (Lassonde et al., 2016). This impact&#xD;
      on subsequent sleep physiology suggests that naps may be an extension of overnight sleep. How&#xD;
      napping status (i.e., habitual and non-habitual napping) impacts overnight sleep physiology&#xD;
      and subsequent memory consolidation is unknown. Thus, this study aims to investigate how&#xD;
      napping vs. staying awake in habitual and non-habitual napping children may impact overnight&#xD;
      sleep physiology and subsequent memory consolidation.&#xD;
