  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic cough is a common troublesome symptom which has a global prevalence of approximately&#xD;
      10%, but with wide variations across continents. The aim of this study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of treatment, patient-reported outcomes and burden of disease in patients with&#xD;
      chronic cough referred to a specialist clinic. The proposed study will use pre-defined&#xD;
      diagnostic criteria, investigations and treatment algorithms such that all recruited patients&#xD;
      will undergo the same investigations and follow a set management algorithm. This study will&#xD;
      objectively and subjectively assess coughing at baseline and after treatment in a real-world&#xD;
      clinical setting. This will allow us to understand the relationship between any objective&#xD;
      reduction in cough after treatment, and whether this translates to any significant&#xD;
      improvement in subjective questionnaire scores. We will assess the impact of health&#xD;
      conditions on lost productivity in monetary units and assess the amount of absenteeism,&#xD;
      presenteeism and daily activity impairment attributable to unexplained chronic&#xD;
      cough/refractory chronic cough. Finally, a patient survey at the end of the study will&#xD;
      evaluate the patients' satisfaction and experience of investigation, management trials and&#xD;
      use of questionnaires.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective observational single-center study of patients referred to secondary&#xD;
      care for investigation and management of explained chronic cough, refractory chronic cough,&#xD;
      and unexplained chronic cough. The study will have 4 research visits integrated between&#xD;
      standard clinical visits. Patients will be recruited from secondary care clinics. Patient&#xD;
      eligibility will be assessed against the study inclusion/exclusion criteria and patients will&#xD;
      undergo informed consent in the research centre. Subjects who provide informed consent and&#xD;
      are enrolled in the study will undergo screening procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Visit 1 (screening) data on demographics and medical history will be collected and a&#xD;
      complete physical examination will be conducted. Subjects will undergo skin prick testing and&#xD;
      spirometry and complete self-reported questionnaires (Leicester Cough Questionnaire,&#xD;
      Valuation of Lost Productivity, Work Productivity, Activity, and Impairment, Healthcare&#xD;
      Resource Utilization, Reflux Disease Questionnaire, Sino-Nasal Outcome Test, and Global&#xD;
      Rating of Change Scale). Subjects will be fitted with a 24-hour cough monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Visit 2, the 24-hour cough monitor will be removed. Subjects will undergo blood sampling,&#xD;
      methacholine challenge, sputum induction, and provide a urine sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between Visits 2 and 3, physicians will provide a single clinical treatment pathway to&#xD;
      address the most likely cause of chronic cough. Treatment for chronic cough will be in line&#xD;
      with current clinical practice guidelines published by the European Respiratory Society&#xD;
      Taskforce on Chronic Cough. Treatment plans will range from 2 weeks to 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3 will occur 2 weeks to 3 months following subjects' second clinical visit. Subjects&#xD;
      will complete self-reported questionnaires (Leicester Cough Questionnaire, Valuation of Lost&#xD;
      Productivity, Work Productivity, Activity, and Impairment, Reflux Disease Questionnaire,&#xD;
      Sino-Nasal Outcome Test, and Global Rating of Change Scale) and be fitted with a 24-hour&#xD;
      cough monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Visit 4 the 24-hour cough monitor will be removed. Subjects will undergo blood sampling,&#xD;
      sputum induction, and provide a urine sample. Subjects will complete a patient satisfaction&#xD;
      survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study procedures will be performed according to local standard operating procedures and&#xD;
      be conducted by trained and experienced staff with supervision by medical doctors. Safety&#xD;
      will be assessed throughout the study by monitoring for adverse events and serious adverse&#xD;
      events.&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Aged ≥18-75&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients referred to a specialist primarily with a history of chronic cough (cough&#xD;
             lasting &gt;8 weeks)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Normal Chest X-ray&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. No Evidence of Airflow Obstruction&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects who are currently established on treatment and their chronic cough is well&#xD;
             controlled.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Unable to perform acceptable and reproducible spirometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Current smoker or ex-smoker with ≥20 pack-year smoking history and abstinence of ≤6&#xD;
             months&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection in the last 1 month which have not&#xD;
             resolved&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Lower respiratory tract infection or pneumonia in the last 1 month&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Asthma exacerbation in the previous month requiring an increase or start of an inhaled&#xD;
             corticosteroid or oral corticosteroid&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Significant other primary pulmonary disorders in particular; pulmonary embolism,&#xD;
             pulmonary hypertension, lung cancer, cystic fibrosis, significant radiologically&#xD;
             proven emphysema, interstitial lung disease or bronchiectasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Any centrally acting medication within the last 2 weeks which in the view of the&#xD;
             investigator could influence the coughing. Any participant who is taking&#xD;
             amitriptyline, dextromethorphan, pregabalin, gabapentin or opioids will not be&#xD;
             eligible to take part in this study unless they are willing and medically able to&#xD;
             withdraw from such medication before the start of visit 1. The reason for this is that&#xD;
             centrally-acting medications may influence coughing rates at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. History of psychiatric illness, drug or alcohol abuse which may interfere in the&#xD;
             participation of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Positive Covid-19 test within 2 weeks of screening visit.&#xD;
