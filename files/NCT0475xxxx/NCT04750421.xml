  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transillumination (TL) is a noninvasive technique that appears to allow preliminary detection&#xD;
      of superficial vascular structures of the face to avoid intravascular HA injection. The&#xD;
      purpose of our study was to test the efficacy of TL in terms of its sensitivity to locate&#xD;
      vessels in the areas undergoing treatment and to reduce post-injection vascular&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transillumination was used during the injection of hyaluronic acid to reduce the risk of&#xD;
      intravascular injection. For the purpose of randomization, patients were asked to choose a&#xD;
      sealed envelope. Inside the envelope was a piece of paper indicating on which side of the&#xD;
      face (right or left) the transillumination would be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each filler injection, transillumination was used on one side; on the other side of the&#xD;
      face, the injection was administered without the use of any vascular exploration method.&#xD;
      After the vessels had been located on the side chosen for the transillumination technique, a&#xD;
      skin-marker pencil was used to draw the vascular mapping of the upper part of the face, which&#xD;
      in our opinion represented the area most at risk of complications, the middle and the lower&#xD;
      parts of the face.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then ice was applied on both sides of the face for 15 s before to proceed with the injections&#xD;
      in order to cause vasoconstriction and to further decrease the risk of an intravascular&#xD;
      injection.Transillumination sensitivity for locating the vessels of the face was assessed.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The random assignment of the right or left side of the face on which the trasnillumination will be used will be done by numbered and sealed envelope.&#xD;
Envelopes will be prepared before the start of inclusion. Each envelope will contain a sheet of paper whose contents cannot be guessed when the envelope is closed. Each sheet will be marked either &quot;Left+TL&quot; or &quot;Right+TL&quot;. Each envelope will contain a unique code number that will be randomly assigned to each patient after inclusion.</intervention_model_description>
