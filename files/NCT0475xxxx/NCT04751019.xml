  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sleep disturbance and insomnia is extremely common and affects up to 30% of adults at any&#xD;
      given time. Moreover, sleep disturbance is known to be particularly prevalent in patients&#xD;
      suffering from mental illness including affective disorders, schizophrenia, anxiety&#xD;
      (Baglioni, 2016). We hypothesise that the use of amber glasses will aid the time taken to&#xD;
      fall asleep without the need for the use of hypnotic medication.A prospective study looking&#xD;
      at 15 new patients admitted to one mental health ward will be undertaken. Data will be&#xD;
      collected on twice weekly basis on the patient's use of: amber glasses alone, hypnotic&#xD;
      medication alone or both. Hypnotic medication will include sedating antihistamines,&#xD;
      benzodiazepines and non-benzodiazepine hypnotics such as zopiclone. Medication prescribed for&#xD;
      dual purpose will be assumed to be used for the treatment of insomnia if given after 2300&#xD;
      hours. Each patient will be enrolled for a period of 4 weeks and the review of use and&#xD;
      suitability will take place in ward review meetings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sleep quality will be assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Assessment tool at baseline&#xD;
      and at the 2 and 4 weeks. At the end of the study period, percentage use of amber glasses and&#xD;
      zopiclone will be used to compare against a historical average of hypnotic use for the most&#xD;
      recent 15 admissions over a similar 4 week period.&#xD;

    <description>Sleep quality will be assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Assessment (PSQI) tool at baseline and at the 2 and 4 weeks. At the end of the study period, percentage use of amber glasses and zopiclone will be used to compare against a historical average of hypnotic use for the most recent 15 admissions over a similar 4 week period. These historic admissions will be matched for diagnosis.</description>

    <description>It is hoped that the use of amber glasses to complement the natural sleep-wake by inducing a perceived 'physiological darkness' to aid the secretion of melatonin should help sleep and reduce the use of hypnotic medication</description>
