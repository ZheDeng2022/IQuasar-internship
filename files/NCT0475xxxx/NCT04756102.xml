      Retrospective study conducted on the records of patients who were seen at Jordan University&#xD;
      hospital in the period January 2016 to December 2020. All primigravid women with FBS that&#xD;
      were done in early pregnancy before completed 20 weeks of gestation were included. Exclusion&#xD;
      criteria were known diabetics, multiple pregnancies, thyroid dysfunction, patients taking&#xD;
      steroids or any other medications for chronic illness (s) and those with missing data.&#xD;
      Patients were divided into 2 groups; group had a FBS 80-120 mg/dl and group 2 with FBS less&#xD;
      than 80 mg/dl. Pregnancy outcomes were then compared between the 2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gestational age was confirmed by early ultra-sound (US) scan before 16 weeks gestation. All&#xD;
      FBS samples were measured at our laboratory. Investigators collected data regarding patients'&#xD;
      age, body mass index (BMI), FBS early in pregnancy, any complication in the pregnancy or the&#xD;
      pregnancy outcome including miscarriage (defined as pregnancy loss before completed 24 weeks&#xD;
      gestation), preterm delivery (defined as spontaneous vaginal delivery before completed 37&#xD;
      weeks gestation), gestational age at delivery, polyhydramnios, congenital abnormality (minor&#xD;
      or major), stillbirth, intra-uterine fetal death (IUFD), neonatal death and mode of delivery.&#xD;
      For those who underwent cesarean section, the indications were also identified. Fetal outcome&#xD;
      included birth weight; APGAR score at 1 minute and APGAR score at 5 minutes. The APGAR score&#xD;
      was determined by the neonatologists who routinely attend deliveries at our hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators also identified those who were diagnosed to have GDM with any intervention&#xD;
      (metformin or insulin and their dosages). Diagnosis of GDM was based on a standard 75 gm&#xD;
      glucose tolerance test (GTT) at 26-28 weeks gestation. A normal FBS level is lower than 95&#xD;
      mg/dL, one hour lower than 180 mg/dL, two hours lower than 155 mg/dL Three hours after&#xD;
      drinking the glucose solution, a normal blood glucose level is lower than 140 mg/dL.&#xD;
