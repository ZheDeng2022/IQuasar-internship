  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Functional constipation is a condition when it is very hard to pass a stool that is not due&#xD;
      to any other health problem or to medicines being taken. This condition is more common in&#xD;
      children and teenagers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has 2 parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aim of the 1st part of the study is to learn if a medicine called prucalopride can&#xD;
      improve bowel movements in children and teenagers with functional constipation. Another aim&#xD;
      is to check for side effects from 2 different doses of prucalopride. The main aim of the 2nd&#xD;
      part of the study is to continue to check for side effects from 2 different doses of&#xD;
      prucalopride.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the 1st part, at the first visit, the study doctor will check who can take part.&#xD;
      Participants who take part will be picked for 1 of 3 treatments by chance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A low dose of prucalopride once a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A higher dose of prucalopride once a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A placebo once a day. In this study, a placebo will look like prucalopride but will not&#xD;
           have any medicine in it. Participants will be treated with prucalopride or a placebo for&#xD;
           12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who took prucalopride will continue to the 2nd part of the study. They will have&#xD;
      the same treatment as they did in the 1st part of the study. They will continue with their&#xD;
      treatment for another 36 weeks. Participants who took placebo in the 1st part of the study&#xD;
      will receive prucalopride in the 2nd part of the study. They will be picked for a low dose or&#xD;
      a high dose of prucalopride by chance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will visit the clinic a few times during treatment. The clinic staff will also&#xD;
      telephone the participants, or their parents or caregivers throughout treatment for a&#xD;
      check-up 4 weeks after last treatment, the clinic staff will telephone the participants, or&#xD;
      their parents or caregivers for a final check-up.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study consists of a 12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled part (Part A) followed by a&#xD;
      36-week double-blind safety extension part (Part B). Participants aged 3 to 17 years are&#xD;
      planned for randomization in a 1:1:1 ratio to the Low Dose Group, High Dose Group, or&#xD;
      matching placebo (placebo-controlled part [Part A]). After completion of Part A, participants&#xD;
      in the placebo group will be re-randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the Low Dose Group or the High&#xD;
      Dose Group (safety extension part [Part B]). Randomization at study entry will be stratified&#xD;
      by toilet-trained status.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Spontaneous bowel movements is defined as a bowel movement that is not preceded within a period of 24 hours by the intake of rescue medication. The average change from baseline in number of SBMs per week derived from the (diary) data over 12 weeks, in toilet-trained participants who are at least 3 years of age collected during the placebo-controlled part (Part A) will be assessed.</description>

    <measure>Part A: Average Change From Baseline in Participants' Stool Consistency During Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Stool consistency will be assessed by typical stool form based on Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS Score): 1- Separate hard lumps, hard to pass, 2- Sausage-shaped, but lumpy, 3- Like a sausage but with cracks on the surface, 4- Like a sausage or snake, smooth and soft, 5- Soft blobs with clear-cut edges, 6- Fluffy pieces with ragged edges, a mushy stool, 7- Watery, no solid pieces, entirely liquid. The average change from baseline in stool consistency (based on BSFS score), assessed as the weekly average during the 12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment phase will be assessed.</description>

    <measure>Part A: Average Change From Baseline in Straining During Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Straining will be assessed based on a 3-point Likert scale: (0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate). The average change from baseline in straining (based on a 3-point Likert scale, assessed as the weekly average during the 12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment phase will be assessed.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Fecal incontinence is defined as unintentional smear or liquid stool in the underwear that is not due to poor wiping. Fecal incontinence can only occur in toilet-trained participants. Non-retentive fecal incontinence is diagnosed (must include at least a 1-month history in a child with a developmental age older than 4 years for all the following): (i) defecation in places inappropriate to the sociocultural context, (ii) no evidence of fecal retention, and (iii) after appropriate evaluation, the fecal incontinence cannot be explained by another medical condition. Proportion of participants with fecal incontinence per week during the 12-week treatment period will be assessed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Treatment Emergent Serious Adverse Events (TESAEs)</measure>

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and that did not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. A TEAE is defined as any event emerging or manifesting at or after the initiation of treatment with an IP or medicinal product or any existing event that worsens in either intensity or frequency following exposure to the IP or medicinal product. A SAE was any untoward medical occurrence (whether considered to be related to investigational product or not) that at any dose: results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital abnormality/birth defect, is an important medical event.
