  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurological condition, which affects the brain. PD gets worse&#xD;
      over time, but how quickly it progresses varies a lot from person to person. Some symptoms of&#xD;
      PD are tremors, stiffness, and slowness of movement. This study will assess how safe and&#xD;
      effective ABBV-951 is in adult participants with PD. Adverse events and change in disease&#xD;
      activity is evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ABBV-951 is an investigational (unapproved) drug containing levodopa/carbidopa (LD/CD) given&#xD;
      as an infusion under the skin for the treatment of Parkinson's Disease. Adult participants&#xD;
      with advanced PD and who have completed M15-736 or M20-339 study will be enrolled.&#xD;
      Approximately 130 participants will be enrolled in the study in approximately 60 sites in the&#xD;
      United States and Australia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive continuous subcutaneous infusion (CSCI) (under the skin) of&#xD;
      ABBV-951 for 96 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their&#xD;
      standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the course of the study at a&#xD;
      hospital or clinic. The effect of the treatment will be checked by medical and remote&#xD;
      telephone assessments, blood tests, checking for side effects, and completing questionnaires.&#xD;

    <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An SAE is an event that results in death, is life-threatening, requires or prolongs hospitalization, results in a congenital anomaly, persistent or significant disability/incapacity or is an important medical event that, based on medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed above.</description>
