      Hemiplegic shoulder pain is a common clinical consequence of stroke and can result in&#xD;
      significant disability.There are several treatments for Hemiplegic shoulder pain. Patient and&#xD;
      family education (ie, range of motion and positioning) is recommended for shoulder pain and&#xD;
      shoulder care after stroke, particularly before discharge or transitions in care. Ultrasound&#xD;
      therapy is frequently used to relieve pain in hemiplegic shoulder; although there were&#xD;
      limited evidences of benefit of ultrasound in hemiplegic shoulder. Laser therapy has become&#xD;
      increasing use in hemiplegic shoulder pain. Previous study shows that low level laser therapy&#xD;
      significantly reduced pain and improved range of motion in hemiplegic shoulder compared with&#xD;
      electrotherapy. High intensity laser therapy (HILT) has been known to reduce pain through&#xD;
      multiple pathways including central nervous system pathway, peripheral nervous system pathway&#xD;
      and tissues pathway. According to Latest systematic review and meta-analysis, HILT&#xD;
      significantly improved pain and disability scores compared with control in musculoskeletal&#xD;
      disease especially with neck and back pain. To the best of our knowledge, there is no&#xD;
      clinical trial regarding the efficacy of HILT in hemiplegic shoulder pain. Therefore, the aim&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Hemiplegic shoulder pain is a common clinical consequence of stroke and can result in&#xD;
      significant disability. Shoulder pain can negatively affect rehabilitation outcomes as good&#xD;
      shoulder function is a prerequisite for successful transfers, maintaining balance, effective&#xD;
      hand function, and performing activities of daily living. The reported prevalence of shoulder&#xD;
      pain varies between 5% and 84%, depending on timing and definition of shoulder pain used. An&#xD;
      incidence of hemiplegic shoulder pain during the first year range from 1% to 22%. Causes of&#xD;
      hemiplegic shoulder pain are multifactorial. Pain is associated with shoulder tissue injury,&#xD;
      abnormal joint mechanics, and central nociceptive hypersensitivity. About one third of&#xD;
      patients with acute stroke have abnormal ultrasound findings in the hemiplegic shoulder when&#xD;
      studied at the time of admission to acute inpatient rehabilitation, including effusion in&#xD;
      biceps tendon or subacromial bursa; tendinopathy of biceps, supraspinatus, or subscapularis;&#xD;
      and rotator cuff tear There are several treatments for Hemiplegic shoulder pain. Patient and&#xD;
      family education (ie, range of motion and positioning) is recommended for shoulder pain and&#xD;
      shoulder care after stroke, particularly before discharge or transitions in care. Well- known&#xD;
      interventions for Hemiplegic shoulder pain includes botulinum toxin injection, intraarticular&#xD;
      steroid injection and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation. Nowadays, there are high&#xD;
      technology modalities which are less invasive such as ultrasound therapy, extracorporeal&#xD;
      shockwave therapy, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and laser therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound therapy is frequently used to relieve pain in hemiplegic shoulder; although there&#xD;
      were limited evidences of benefit of ultrasound in hemiplegic shoulder. Randomized control&#xD;
      trials in 2010 showed that ultrasound therapy significantly reduce pain and increase pain&#xD;
      free ROM of post stroke shoulder pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However from previous study in1972 showed that ultrasound dose not significantly increases&#xD;
      pain free range of motion in the involved shoulders of patients with hemiplegia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laser therapy has become increasing use in hemiplegic shoulder pain. Previous study shows&#xD;
      that low level laser therapy significantly reduced pain and improved range of motion in&#xD;
      hemiplegic shoulder compared with electrotherapy. High intensity laser therapy (HILT) has&#xD;
      been known to reduce pain through multiple pathways including central nervous system pathway,&#xD;
      peripheral nervous system pathway and tissues pathway. In the central nervous system, laser&#xD;
      therapy centrally inhibits pain sensation by increasing the secretion of endogenous opioids&#xD;
      such as b-endorphins. In the peripheral nervous system, laser therapy has been reported to&#xD;
      decrease the secretion of substance P by peripheral receptors. Laser therapy might increase&#xD;
      the latency and decrease the conduction velocity of sensory nerves by inhibiting Aδ- and&#xD;
      C-fiber transmission; these in turn may decrease the transmission of pain signals. In&#xD;
      tissues, laser therapy may also reduce the release of histamine and bradykinin in injured&#xD;
      tissues and increase the pain threshold. HILT increases cell metabolism, vascular&#xD;
      permeability, and blood flow in deep tissue structures. Compared to low level laser therapy,&#xD;
      HILT have a shorter laser emission time and a longer laser emission interval. Therefore, a&#xD;
      large amount of laser irradiation can be delivered to deep tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to Latest systematic review and meta-analysis, HILT significantly improved pain and&#xD;
      disability scores compared with control in musculoskeletal disease especially with neck and&#xD;
      back pain. From this study there was insufficient evidence to conclude the efficacy of HILT&#xD;
      on shoulder pain. However, in randomized controlled trial which studied the efficacy of HILT&#xD;
      in patients with subacromial impingement syndrome showed greater reduction in pain,&#xD;
      improvement in articular movement and muscle strength of the affected shoulder after 10&#xD;
      treatment sessions of HILT than did participants receiving Ultrasound therapy over a period&#xD;
      of 2 consecutive weeks. In management of frozen shoulder, HILT (3 times per week for 3 weeks)&#xD;
      provided significant pain relief at 3 and 8 weeks, but not at the final follow-up time point&#xD;
      ( 12 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the best of our knowledge, there is no clinical trial regarding the efficacy of HILT in&#xD;
      hemiplegic shoulder pain. Therefore, the aim of our study is to investigate the beneficial&#xD;
      effects of HILT on pain reduction, ROM and function in patients with hemiplegic shoulder&#xD;
      pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Objectives To investigate the beneficial effects of HILT on pain reduction, ROM and&#xD;
           function in patients with hemiplegic shoulder pain compared with ultrasound therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Research Process Please specify research procedures, research devices, steps of research&#xD;
           process, things that participants/volunteers must do or be treated (such as number of&#xD;
           blood drawn, amount of blood drawn, number of appointments, time consuming for&#xD;
           participation in the study). If the research proposal is attached, the wordings in Thai&#xD;
           and English versions must be the same, including the reference pages in the relevant&#xD;
           proposal.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Stroke patients who have hemiplegic shoulder pain and meet with inclusion criteria&#xD;
                will be recruited from inpatient department of Department of Rehabilitation&#xD;
                Medicine Faculty of Medicine, Siriraj Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Participants whose characteristics meet the exclusion criteria will be excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. All participants who are recruited will be provided with an information sheet&#xD;
                explaining the study protocol and informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Sticker determining that the patient was recruited to the shoulder pain research&#xD;
                project will be placed in front of patient's chart to inform the practitioner.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. The assessor (Physiatrist) will assess participant's baseline demographic data,&#xD;
                pain score, affected shoulder range of motion and brunnstrom classification.&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. After randomization, the participants are divided into 2 groups. Participants will&#xD;
                be randomly allocated to experimental group or control group with the help of&#xD;
                computer-generated block of four randomization sequence placed in sequentially&#xD;
                numbered opaque sealed envelopes by administration staff 6.1 Experimental group:&#xD;
                HILT + sham ultrasound therapy participants will receive HILT treatment 1 session&#xD;
                per day over a period of 2 consecutive weeks (5 days/week); total 10 sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
                In this study the investigators use an HIRO 3.0 device apply to hemiplegic shoulder&#xD;
                and the area of following muscles include upper trapezius, supraspinatus, deltoid,&#xD;
                pectoralis minor muscles and the tender points.&#xD;
&#xD;
                The treatment consists of high peak power (3kW), a wave length of 1064 nm. Two&#xD;
                phases of treatment will be performed according to Rotator cuff tendinopathy&#xD;
                protocol of the device. Two steps are predicted in the initial (fast manual&#xD;
                scanning phase) and final (slow scanning phase) phases of the treatment; the&#xD;
                intensity used are 810, 970 and 1070 mJ/cm2, respectively. Therefore, the total&#xD;
                energy administered will be approximately 2500 J. The total treatment time will be&#xD;
                approximately 10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
                The participants will also receive sham ultrasound therapy for 10 minutes. (HILT&#xD;
                and sham HILT will be provided by co-investigator who is a resident of Department&#xD;
                of Rehabilitation Medicine Faculty of Medicine, Siriraj Hospital).&#xD;
&#xD;
                6.2 In control group: sham HILT + ultrasound therapy participants will receive&#xD;
                continuous ultrasound therapy for 10 minutes in the same area as an experimental&#xD;
                group with Chattanooga intellect mobile ultrasound device. The device will be&#xD;
                operated at the frequency of 1 MHz, an intensity of 2 W/cm2 and a duty cycle of&#xD;
                100% in the same area of the HILT group. The participants will also receive sham&#xD;
                HILT for 10 minutes. (Ultrasound therapy and sham ultrasound will be provided by&#xD;
                Physiotherapists of Department of Rehabilitation Medicine Faculty of Medicine,&#xD;
                Siriraj Hospital.)&#xD;
&#xD;
             7. Both groups will receive 3 ROM exercise sessions per day. First at Physiotherapy&#xD;
                gym by the physiotherapists who do ultrasound therapy, second at Occupational&#xD;
                therapy room by the occupational therapist and third at bedside by themselves. The&#xD;
                researcher who is physiatrist will check for compliance. Participants and their&#xD;
                caregiver will be educated about proper positioning and manual handling.&#xD;
&#xD;
             8. After 10 sessions the assessor who are blind to the intervention groups&#xD;
                (Physiatrist) will assess pain score ( numeric rating scale), affected shoulder&#xD;
                range of motion with the standard protocol to measure shoulder flexion, abduction,&#xD;
                internal and external rotation with goniometer according to the standard text book,&#xD;
                brunnstorm classification and side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
             9. Participants are permitted to ask for pain killer medication (paracetamol) and pill&#xD;
                count will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bobath sling will be worn only while walking, otherwise participants will use pillow support&#xD;
      for proper positioning.&#xD;
