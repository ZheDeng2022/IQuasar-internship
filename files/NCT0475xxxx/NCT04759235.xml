  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Esophageal cancer (EC) is the seventh most frequently diagnosed cancers and the sixth leading&#xD;
      causes of cancer death worldwide . It is one of the most common malignancy in China, with the&#xD;
      third highest morbidity and mortality rate. More than 90% of patients with EC in China have&#xD;
      esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) followed by&#xD;
      surgery is currently widely used strategy for locally advanced surgical EC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, conventional imaging methods have certain defects (focus only on the volume&#xD;
      change) in the evaluation of the efficacy of nCRT. Whereas functional imaging can more&#xD;
      comprehensively reflect the biological and microstructural characterization of tumors. The&#xD;
      changes of these aspects of tumors can be observed earlier than volumetric changes of tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The normal metabolism of the body is the basis for ensuring life activities. Due to the&#xD;
      increased energy demand and proliferation of tumor tissue in patients with cancer, the&#xD;
      metabolism of patients is different from that of normal person. Thus, the metabolic&#xD;
      alterations seen in cancer cells have emerged as one of the hallmarks of cancer. Previous&#xD;
      metabolomic studies have demonstrated various metabolic alterations in patients with ESCC.&#xD;
      Many metabolites have been found to be promising diagnostic, staging or prognostic biomarkers&#xD;
      for ESCC. However, there are few studies on metabolic markers on the chemoradiation&#xD;
      sensitivity of esophageal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the aim of the present study is to evaluate the value of functional imaging&#xD;
      parameters and metabolic markers in assessing and predicting pathological response in&#xD;
      patients who underwent nCRT for ESCC.&#xD;
