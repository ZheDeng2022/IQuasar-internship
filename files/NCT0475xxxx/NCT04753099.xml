  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Telehealth is a delivery format that shows promise, and occupation-based coaching (OBC) is&#xD;
      one intervention that can be delivered via telehealth. OBC is a collaborative coaching model&#xD;
      with the therapist and the family (caregiver and child) that has been shown to improve&#xD;
      positive child-caregiver interactions, caregiver competence with managing child health&#xD;
      maintenance tasks, and improve engagement in meaningful everyday tasks (such as health&#xD;
      maintenance tasks, self-care, and social participation). The goal of this pilot study is to&#xD;
      improve child health outcomes and family quality of life for young children diagnosed with&#xD;
      type 1 diabetes. Specifically, this pilot randomized control trial will provide valuable&#xD;
      information about the preliminary effectiveness of occupation-based coaching (OBC) via&#xD;
      telehealth to improve the quality of life of families and children diagnosed with type 1&#xD;
      diabetes (T1D). It is hypothesized that OBC is an effective intervention that can be&#xD;
      delivered to T1D families living in rural communities via telehealth methods.&#xD;

      Design The research investigators plan to use a randomized control trial design with a small&#xD;
      sample size (n=16) to gather pilot data. This pilot data will provide the foundation for a&#xD;
      future full-scale clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study utilizes Occupation-Based-Coaching (OBC) via telehealth to improve quality of life&#xD;
      of families and children diagnosed with type 1 diabetes living in rural communities.&#xD;
      Occupation based coaching is an intervention founded on the principles of occupational&#xD;
      performance coaching and has proven to be an effective intervention in family-centered&#xD;
      practice. OBC is a strength-based approach that emphases collaboration with clients in goals&#xD;
      setting and attainment to increase overall health and quality of life. Clients are the&#xD;
      central focus of the intervention and generate their own strategies to address goals as part&#xD;
      of the coaching process. In their role as coach, the therapists employ techniques such as&#xD;
      reflective questioning and comments to support clients in identifying existing routines and&#xD;
      rituals that impact goal attainment and to increase knowledge and access to resources that&#xD;
      can promote improved caregiver quality of life after a child's diagnoses with T1D. Occupation&#xD;
      based coaching can be divided into the following steps: &quot;(1) setting goals, (2) exploring&#xD;
      options, (3) planning action, (4) carrying out the plan, (5) checking performance, and (6)&#xD;
      generalizing.&quot; An expert in occupation-based coaching will provide intervention protocol&#xD;
      training to the research team. An intervention fidelity measure, providing more information&#xD;
      about the intervention, is attached as an Addendum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure Participants will be recruited through use of social media platforms,&#xD;
      ResearchMatch, snowball sampling /referrals, and Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation&#xD;
      outreach events. Written consent from the guardian, assent from children aged 7-12, and&#xD;
      parental permission forms will be obtained prior to the beginning the study. Through simple&#xD;
      randomization, 16 families (caregiver/child dyads) will be allocated into either the control&#xD;
      group or the intervention group. Due to IRB regulations and ethics, the control group will&#xD;
      receive the intervention after study completion. A research team member will then call the&#xD;
      guardian to schedule the CGM training, evaluation, and the first intervention appointment (if&#xD;
      in the intervention group). Each subsequent visit and post-evaluation will be scheduled the&#xD;
      week prior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to starting the intervention, participants in the control and intervention group will&#xD;
      receive training regarding continuous glucose monitor (CGM) from a certified diabetes&#xD;
      educator. The CDE will deliver the training in a group setting as able (individual if needed&#xD;
      due to scheduling or participant preference) via Zoom, the training will last approximately&#xD;
      60-90 minutes. If the participants were previously using a Dexcom, the training will likely&#xD;
      be shorter at 30-60 minutes. The training will be followed by a two-week trial with the CGM&#xD;
      to ensure comfort and competence using the CGM device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the trial period is concluded, the team evaluators (registered nurse, registered&#xD;
      occupational therapist) will administer all assessments. The registered nurse will administer&#xD;
      the Demographic Family Form (2-3 minutes) with the caregiver, WHO-QOL (10 minutes) with the&#xD;
      caregiver, and provide directions for the at-home hemoglobin a1c testing (5 minutes) with the&#xD;
      caregiver and child. Procedures for the hemoglobin a1c are outlined in an addendum. The&#xD;
      occupational therapist evaluator will administer the Parental Scale of Competence (5 minutes)&#xD;
      with the caregiver and Goal Attainment Scale (5-10 minutes) with the caregiver and child as&#xD;
      appropriate. Time-in-Range will be read separately from the CGM application, and the&#xD;
      certified diabetes educator will pull all data from the application. The CGM reads the&#xD;
      child's blood glucose levels. Approximately 30 minutes total will be allocated for the&#xD;
      evaluation. All evaluators are blinded to the group assignments to decrease risk of bias. The&#xD;
      study participants will have access to the certified diabetes educator to ask questions about&#xD;
      the CGM throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the two-week trial with the CGM, the families will begin the 12-weeks of either&#xD;
      receiving the intervention/OBC or control/standard care. During the 12 weeks, the control&#xD;
      group will receive standard care (Table 1) for a child with type 1 diabetes continued by&#xD;
      their current medical provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention group will receive occupation-based-coaching via telehealth, along with&#xD;
      standard care. Individual intervention sessions will be conducted 1 time per week for a&#xD;
      1-hour period by a licensed occupational therapy practitioner and /or student supervised by a&#xD;
      licensed occupational therapy practitioner. The intervention will be delivered via&#xD;
      telehealth, utilizing a private room equipped with telehealth technology. Telehealth&#xD;
      intervention will be provided through Zoom for HealthCare, a Health Insurance Portability and&#xD;
      Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) compliant video platform. Prior to each session, families&#xD;
      will receive an email with a link to connect to the teleconference and a text reminder the&#xD;
      day before the scheduled session. After completion of a 12-week intervention period, outcome&#xD;
      measures will be re-administered by the nurse and/or occupational therapy practitioner, who&#xD;
      remains blinded to participants' group allocation. All sessions will be recorded via Zoom and&#xD;
      saved on the research computer. The recorded sessions will be sent to rev.com or other&#xD;
      comparable transcription service for transcription. The evaluators will then code the&#xD;
      transcriptions for intervention fidelity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A research team evaluator will administer all outcome measures and will be blinded to the&#xD;
      intervention and control group to ensure rigor and avoid bias. All family member participants&#xD;
      will be given a unique, anonymous identifier to maintain confidentiality. The research team&#xD;
      will store all documents and data in a shared OneDrive (a secure cloud drive) that is only&#xD;
      accessible to the research team and will keep the data for 3 years after study completion,&#xD;
      per IRB guidelines. The research team completed all CITI training modules and are received&#xD;
      additional training on adverse and unexpected events from the IRB office prior to starting&#xD;
      the study. The researchers will immediately report any adverse or unexpected events to the&#xD;
      IRB office and fill out the appropriate forms.&#xD;
