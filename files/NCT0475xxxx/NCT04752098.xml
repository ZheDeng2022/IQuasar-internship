  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to develop a new noninvasive ultrasound based technique, called&#xD;
      vibro-acoustic analysis (VAA), for evaluation of infant bone health with particular&#xD;
      application in assessment of bone health in premature infants who are at risk for bone&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With increased survival of very low birth weight and premature infants over recent decades,&#xD;
      bone assessment has become especially vital with the recognition of metabolic bone disease&#xD;
      (MBD) of prematurity. Bone assessment became especially vital during last decades with the&#xD;
      growing emphasis on metabolic bone disease of prematurity and low-birth-weight infants.&#xD;
      Statistics shows that up to 50% of low birth weight and preterm newborns are likely to&#xD;
      develop metabolic bone disease. Currently, no screening test has been shown to provide both&#xD;
      sensitive and specific evidence of developing MBD over the first several weeks of life in the&#xD;
      premature infants. Therefore, there is a need for a non-invasive tool for evaluation of&#xD;
      infant bone health. This study will be conducted on premature infants at risk for MBD at&#xD;
      multiple time points during their growth, with full term infants as controls. vibro-acoustic&#xD;
      analysis (VAA) measurements will be done on the tibia. VAA measurements for the premature&#xD;
      infants will be compared to those of full term infants. Performance of VAA in identifying&#xD;
      osteopenia and its ability to monitor the response to treatment will be evaluated. The&#xD;
      investigators will use an ultrasound system that has been used in the pilot study and employ&#xD;
      a transducer with a smaller footprint for pediatric application.&#xD;

    <measure>Specific Aim 1 - Optimize VAA method for quantitative. The goal is to optimize the VAA system for small size of preterm tibia bone.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year.</time_frame>
    <description>Obtaining a pediatric ultrasound transducer with smaller footprint and shallower focus is the first step for optimization. Secondly, using smallest size hydrophone with a high receiver sensitivity complete the optimization. The investigators will consider hydrophone bandwidth as a measure for optimal sensitivity.</description>

    <measure>Specific Aim 2: Determine the efficacy of the VAA method for quantitative assessment of tibia bone in a pilot study of term and preterm infants. The goal is to measure the bone health of preterm newborn using our new ultrasound method.</measure>
    <time_frame>through the study completion, up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Vibro-acoustic measurements for the age-adjusted premature infants will be compared to those of normal infants. Performance of vibro-acoustic in monitoring the treatment will be assessed by comparing to the measurement of previous visits.</description>

    <description>The study visits will be at â‰¥3 time points at ages: within the first 28 days after birth, 2 months, 3 months, and, if still hospitalized, at 4 months and at 6 months.&#xD;
The ultrasound machine to the nursery or neonatal intensive care unit at a scheduled time.&#xD;
The appropriate ultrasound probe will be placed on the infant's tibia and a miniature hydrophone near the probe. A series of ultrasound measurements will be obtained and the ultrasound data will be saved for offline processing.&#xD;
The Investigators will repeat the measurement in 3 locations of the infant's tibia.&#xD;
Each ultrasound measurement takes a few seconds. The complete ultrasound study will take about 15 minutes at each visit.&#xD;
All procedures will be conducted in the nursery or neonatal intensive care unit to ensure infant safety.&#xD;
The ultrasound measurement for full-term infants can be done in ultrasound lab.</description>

    <description>The study will develop and validate a new ultrasonic method for assessment of infant bone by evaluating structural and mechanical characteristics of the infant tibia. This project will utilize a novel, non-invasive method, vibro-acoustic analysis (VAA), to evaluate infant bone properties in a wide frequency range while reducing the artifacts from soft tissue.</description>
