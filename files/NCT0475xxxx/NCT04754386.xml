  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the acceptability, feasibility and effectiveness of&#xD;
      a caregiver-assisted oral fluid-based HIV test to screen children for HIV in Zambia. The&#xD;
      results of this study are intended to support expanded access to HIV testing and treatment&#xD;
      services for children, and to ensure that all newly diagnosed children are linked to clinical&#xD;
      care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Globally, there are 1.8 million children living with HIV (CLHIV); however, despite&#xD;
      great progress over the past 15 years, only 52% are receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART),&#xD;
      leaving approximately 864,000 children in need of treatment. According to the ZAMPHIA study,&#xD;
      only 50.6% of HIV-positive Zambian children aged 0-14 years knew their HIV status (UNAIDS 1st&#xD;
      90). Pediatric case finding is the first and, critical step to close the pediatric ART gap.&#xD;
      In Zambia, there are an estimated 25,920 CLHIV in need of HIV treatment. Reaching this&#xD;
      population is challenging, because children are dependent on parents and caregivers to access&#xD;
      HIV testing services. Parents and caregivers often face logistical, societal and other&#xD;
      barriers that limit the uptake of testing services for children. In order to achieve the&#xD;
      second and third UNAIDS 95 targets of pediatric HIV treatment coverage and viral load&#xD;
      suppression to reach epidemic control, country programs need to utilize increasingly targeted&#xD;
      and innovative testing modalities to optimize the identification CLHIV. Saliva-based&#xD;
      screening tests may present a safe and reliable way to identify children living with HIV that&#xD;
      can expand access to this essential service in resource-limited settings where most CLHIV&#xD;
      reside.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The study will have a cross-sectional cluster sampling design, in which large&#xD;
      facilities in two provinces will be selected using probability-proportional-to-size (PPS)&#xD;
      sampling. Within each of 15 selected facilities, adult index parent/caregivers who are the&#xD;
      parent/caregivers of approximately 200 children will be recruited to accept oral fluid-based&#xD;
      HIV test kits for their children. There will be 3000 participants in the sample. Index&#xD;
      parent/caregivers will be consented to participate in the study, given a number of OTKs&#xD;
      corresponding to the number of children eligible for testing, followed up to confirm&#xD;
      saliva-based test (SBT) results, participate in a testing experience survey, and return the&#xD;
      OTK. All children screening HIV-positive will receive active linkage to confirmatory&#xD;
      diagnostic testing, and treatment services for newly diagnosed HIV-positive children. In&#xD;
      addition to these data, a sample (n=445) of caregivers will be asked questions regarding&#xD;
      their experiences with administering the screening kit on their children.&#xD;
