    <textblock>
      The purpose of this dose finding/comparative efficacy study is to first single out the most&#xD;
      appropriate dose of mannitol for bowel preparation (phase II) and, subsequently, demonstrate&#xD;
      the non-inferiority of the efficacy of mannitol vs standard split 2L PEG ASC (Moviprep®)&#xD;
      (phase III) in bowel preparation for colonoscopy .&#xD;

About half a litre of clear liquid should be drunk in the next hour to prevent dehydration according to local practice at the centre.
