  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-part study. Part 1 will evaluate relative bioavailability of temsavir (TMR)&#xD;
      following single dose administration of the reference fostemsavir (FTR) compared to two&#xD;
      low-dose ER tablet formulations of FTR. In Part 2, the effect of food on the bioavailability&#xD;
      of TMR will be assessed on the selected low-dose ER tablet formulation from Part 1.&#xD;
