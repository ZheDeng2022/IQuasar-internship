      Preimplantation embryo aneuploidy is a major source of adverse outcomes in human reproduction&#xD;
      since it leads to implantation failure, early pregnancy loss or severe chromosomal diseases.&#xD;
      The risk of embryos aneuploidy is drastically increased after 35 years old. The intra uterine&#xD;
      transfer of euploid embryos assessed through such techniques as next-generation sequencing&#xD;
      (NGS) based Comprehensive chromosomal Testing of Trophectoderm (TE) biopsies of Blastocysts&#xD;
      (CTTEB), may improve implantation and live birth rates, and decrease miscarriage rates. But&#xD;
      no randomized controlled trial (RCT) was ever performed to test the interest of CTTEB for&#xD;
      women that really needed it (≥35 to ≤ 41 years old). In this multicentre&#xD;
      randomized-controlled-trial, the investigators will compare live birth rate obtained after&#xD;
      the first single frozen-thawed blastocyst transfer cycle following the&#xD;
      freeze-all-Intracytoplasmic sperm injection cycle in infertile and old couples between two&#xD;
      different strategies of Day 5/6 blastocyst selection:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control group: morphological criteria (Istanbul consensus)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interventional group: international recommendations after CTTEB (www.pgdis.org;&#xD;
           Newsletter May 27, 2019).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The presence of chromosomal abnormalities (aneuploidy) in the pre-implantation embryonic&#xD;
      stage is one of the major causes of human reproductive disorders, as it is responsible for&#xD;
      embryo implantation failures, early or late miscarriages and the birth of children with&#xD;
      chromosomal syndromes. This is mainly due to the existence of chromosomal abnormalities of&#xD;
      meiotic, especially maternal, or mitotic origin occurring during the first three cell&#xD;
      divisions of the embryo. As a result, human embryos have higher rates of aneuploidy than&#xD;
      other species. Thus, it has been suggested that only 30% of conceptions reach term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ART) is to optimize the chances of&#xD;
      conception and delivery of healthy new-borns. It is necessary to improve the results of IVF&#xD;
      (in vitro fertilization) programs and to reduce adverse effects (miscarriages, multiple&#xD;
      pregnancies), especially in couples with patients with poor prognosis, such as older women.&#xD;
      The choice of embryos to be transferred is a key step for the success of ART infertility&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the choice of embryos is based solely on their morphology, evaluated on the 5th or&#xD;
      6th day of development at a stage known as the &quot;blastocyst&quot;. Each embryo is observed under&#xD;
      the microscope and described according to standardized morphological criteria. This&#xD;
      description of the blastocyst is based on 3 constituents of the embryo: the degree of&#xD;
      expansion of the blastocoelic cavity, the appearance of the internal cell mass (ICM) and the&#xD;
      presence of trophectodermal cells (TE). These criteria have been described as predictive of&#xD;
      live birth rates after transfer of fresh or thawed embryos. However, its ability to identify&#xD;
      the embryo with the highest potential for implantation is debatable, due to its weak&#xD;
      association with embryonic chromosomal status, which is a critical factor in the implant&#xD;
      potential of each embryo. In addition, it is known that embryos that do not meet these&#xD;
      morphological criteria are discarded, although it has been proven that their transfer could&#xD;
      lead to a live birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the risk of embryonic aneuploidy is significantly increased after the age of 35, the&#xD;
      objective of our RCT is to evaluate the efficacy of the CTTEB using the latest technologies&#xD;
      and methodologies (i.e., combined embryo culture to blastocyst stage, immediate freezing of&#xD;
      the embryonic cohort with delayed transfer, TE biopsy, NGS, and Single Embryo Transfer (SET))&#xD;
      in the management of infertile patients over 35 years of age. The live birth rate obtained&#xD;
      after the first transfer of a single frozen embryo will be compared between two groups of&#xD;
      couples, randomized in two arms: i) transfer of a single euploid blastocyst; ii) transfer of&#xD;
      a single blastocyst of unknown chromosomal status, chosen on the basis of the usual&#xD;
      morphological criteria, in the first thawing cycle following the freezing of all the&#xD;
      blastocysts of the patient couples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the culture medium of each embryo collected will be analysed in a second stage&#xD;
      to assess whether it is possible to develop a diagnosis of aneuploidy without the need for&#xD;
      trophectoderm biopsy (non invasive).&#xD;
