  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to test the use of pramipexole in patients being treated for Opioid&#xD;
      Use Disorder to test its ability to reduce symptoms of both Restless Legs Syndrome and&#xD;
      protracted opioid withdrawal and thereby promote initiation, engagement, and retention in&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a parallel, two-arm, double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled 2-week trial&#xD;
      investigating the effects of pramipexole 0.25-0.5 mg on Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) symptoms&#xD;
      in patients suffering from opioid withdrawal. The investigators hypothesize that pramipexole&#xD;
      is an effective treatment for RLS symptoms in Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) patients during&#xD;
      post-detox clinical stabilization. Further, the investigators hypothesize that treatment of&#xD;
      RLS in this context will also improve overall symptoms of opioid withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RLS is a sensory-motor neurological disorder characterized by an irresistible urge to move&#xD;
      the legs. The investigators have recently confirmed anecdotal reports that RLS is common&#xD;
      among patients with OUD experiencing opioid withdrawal. Dopamine agonists such as pramipexole&#xD;
      are efficacious and first-line FDA-approved treatments in low doses for RLS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and enrollment will occur at the Gavin Foundation Clinical Stabilization Services&#xD;
      (CSS) in Quincy, Massachusetts. Eligible patients will be randomized to two weeks of&#xD;
      pramipexole or placebo after an initial 3-day screening period and will be asked to complete&#xD;
      5 remote study visits over video or phone. Participants will be asked to complete sleep&#xD;
      diaries and questionnaires at various points throughout the study.&#xD;
