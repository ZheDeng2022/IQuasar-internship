  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      n pre-clinical studies and early-stage clinical trials, PDE4 inhibitors such as rolipram have&#xD;
      been shown to enhance memory. They also improve depressive-like behaviors induced by chronic&#xD;
      unpredictable mild stress, lipopolysaccharide, or ethanol abstinence . Consequently, it is&#xD;
      reasonable to believe that PDE4 is a potential target for treatment of the comorbidity of&#xD;
      depression and AD.The aim of the current study is to evaluate the potential adjunct&#xD;
      antidepressant effect of the Phosphodiesterase-4 Inhibitor Roflumilast in adult patients with&#xD;
      MDD.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4), an important member of the PDE superfamily, is a key regulator of&#xD;
      intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) level. As the second messenger, cAMP activates protein kinase&#xD;
      A, which phosphorylates the subsequent downstream cAMP-response element binding (CREB)&#xD;
      protein. In the central nervous system, this signaling cascade exerts both pre- and&#xD;
      post-synaptic effects and is essential for a variety of cellular functions, including&#xD;
      neurotransmitter release and neuroprotection. Inhibition of PDE4 prevents cAMP breakdown,&#xD;
      which is well recognized as the mechanism by which PDE4 inhibitors can treat impaired memory&#xD;
      linked to several brain disorders. In pre-clinical studies and early-stage clinical trials,&#xD;
      PDE4 inhibitors such as rolipram have been shown to enhance memory. They also improve&#xD;
      depressive-like behaviors induced by chronic unpredictable mild stress, lipopolysaccharide,&#xD;
      or ethanol abstinence . Consequently, it is reasonable to believe that PDE4 is a potential&#xD;
      target for treatment of the comorbidity of depression and AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the current study is to evaluate the potential adjunct antidepressant effect of&#xD;
      Roflumilast in adult patients with MDD. Furthermore, we will assess the relationship between&#xD;
      HAM-D score and BDNF as well as their role as a therapeutic targets of MDD.&#xD;

    <description>The principal measure of the outcome was the 17-items Effect on Hamilton Depression rating scale score. Scoring is based on the 17-item scale and scores of 0-7 are considered as being normal, 8-13 suggest mild depression, 14-17 moderate depression and scores over 17 are indicative of severe depression. Remission is defined as Effect on Hamilton Depression rating scale total score ≤ 7 (primary outcome). Treatment response is defined as ≥ 50% drop in the Effect on Hamilton Depression rating scale total score.</description>
