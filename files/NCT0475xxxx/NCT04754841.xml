  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Platelets correspond to one of the most widely used blood components in transfusion medicine,&#xD;
      given their importance in the prevention of bleeding disorders in patients with&#xD;
      multifactorial thrombocytopenia and non-immunological etiology, as well as in the management&#xD;
      of traumatic or blood-related bleeding. surgical treatments. Given its wide margin of use and&#xD;
      the constant demand for it for use within the different management schemes and procedures&#xD;
      associated with the medical act, it is the objective of both hemotherapy services and blood&#xD;
      banks and blood products to have availability component constant to meet such requirements.&#xD;
      The main problem of this resource is its short useful life (5 to 7 days) which limits its&#xD;
      availability, especially in the Latin American context where the production of blood&#xD;
      components as well as the resources allocated for this purpose by state entities to blood&#xD;
      banks are generally limited. Cryopreservation at -80 ° C using Dimethylsulfoxide as a&#xD;
      preservative solution is a technique used since the 1950s to prolong platelet survival, the&#xD;
      improvement of which has been remarkable in recent years, thus constituting an alternative&#xD;
      for the resolution of this problem.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HYPOTHESIS: Through cryopreservation it is possible to prolong the survival time of platelets&#xD;
      up to 4 times, compared to those preserved under the conventional method, maintaining a&#xD;
      viability equal to or greater than 50%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a direct relationship between survival time, viability and functionality of&#xD;
      cryopreserved platelets depending on the model of cryoprotective solution used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY OUTCOME: survival of cryopreserved platelets greater than 28 days SECUNDARY OUTCOME:&#xD;
      viability of cryopreserved platelets greater than 50%&#xD;
&#xD;
      INCLUSION CRITERIA: Concentrates from donors over 18 years of age who meet the requirements&#xD;
      established by law 22990 (Of Argentine Republic) for donating blood and blood components will&#xD;
      be included in this study, from whom a number of platelets greater than or equal to 3 x10 E11&#xD;
      can be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Platelet concentrates that present any of the following characteristics&#xD;
      will be excluded from the investigation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concentrates that have not met all of the standards required for use in humans or that at the&#xD;
      time of the study more than 24 hours have passed since they were obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A blind experimental study will be carried out (those who evaluate viability and&#xD;
      functionality of platelets will not know the cryopreservation times or the concentration of&#xD;
      the cryopreservative)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aliquots of platelets with group and factor A +, A-, B +, B-, AB +, AB-, O + and O- obtained&#xD;
      from those people who come to the hemotherapy center as voluntary donors and who in turn&#xD;
      express their decision to participate in this protocol by signing an informed consent&#xD;
      designed for this purpose. Obtaining platelets will be performed by apheresis using the Trima&#xD;
      ACCEL cell separator, version 7.0, TERUMO BCT brand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A minimum total of 3.3 x1011 platelets will be obtained in a volume between 200 - 300 ml, for&#xD;
      each donor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A: It will consist of 70 aliquots of 3 ml each with 1.9 x109 platelets to which a&#xD;
      solution composed of: 1 ml obtained from the following mixture will be added (0.8 ml of 100%&#xD;
      Dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and 4 ml of 0 sodium chloride , 9%). They will then be frozen at -80&#xD;
      ° C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B Group: It will be made up of 70 aliquots of 3 ml each with 1.9 x109 platelets to which will&#xD;
      be added a solution composed of: 0.4 ml of 20% UNC brand albumin and 0.6 ml obtained from the&#xD;
      following mixture (1.4 ml of Dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) 100% and 4 ml of Dextrose 5%). They&#xD;
      will then be frozen at -80 ° C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group C: It will be made up of 70 aliquots of 3 ml each with 1.9 x109 platelets to which will&#xD;
      be added a solution composed of: 0.4 ml of 20% UNC brand albumin and 0.6 ml obtained from the&#xD;
      following mixture (1.4 ml of Dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) 100% and 4 ml of 0.9% sodium chloride).&#xD;
      They will then be frozen at -80 ° C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A group of 71 aliquots of 3 ml each with 1.9 x109 irradiated platelets kept at 22 ° C under&#xD;
      constant stirring for 5 days (twenty-four aliquots for each period of time evaluated) will be&#xD;
      used as a reference for the comparison of results (group N).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Viability:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will be evaluated through the platelet count carried out by the Beckman-Coulter system,&#xD;
      the measurement of the pH of the cryopreserved platelets after being thawed (expected values&#xD;
      between 6.4 and 7.4) and the immunophenotyping of the platelets by flow cytometry (CMF) using&#xD;
      fluorescent anti CD61-PE antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functionality:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will be evaluated from the immunophenotyping of platelets by flow cytometry (CMF) using&#xD;
      fluorescent anti-CD41 and anti-CD62-FITC antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before carrying out the CMF analysis, 4 microliters of a 50 mmol ADP solution will be added&#xD;
      to each sample in order to induce platelet activation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both the viability analysis and the functionality of the cryopreserved product will be&#xD;
      carried out by 3 biochemists, collaborating members of the research in the biochemical&#xD;
      analysis laboratory of the hospital.&#xD;
