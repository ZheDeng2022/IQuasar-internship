        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. An informed consent document signed and dated by the participant and the Investigator 2.&#xD;
        Aged between 18 and 50 years old on the day of signing the consent form 3. In good health&#xD;
        with no history, or current evidence, of clinically significant medical conditions, and no&#xD;
        clinically significant test abnormalities that will interfere with participant safety, as&#xD;
        defined by medical history, physical examination, (including vital signs), ECG, and routine&#xD;
        laboratory tests as determined by the Investigator 4. A documented medical history prior to&#xD;
        enrolment 5. The following criteria are applicable to female participants participating in&#xD;
        the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test prior to&#xD;
             enrolment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Females of non-childbearing potential:&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Post-menopausal* females; defined as having a history of amenorrhea for &gt;12 months&#xD;
             with no alternative medical cause, and /or by FSH level &gt;40mLU/mL, confirmed by&#xD;
             laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Documented status as being surgically sterile (hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy&#xD;
             and bilateral oophorectomyhysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy and bilateral&#xD;
             oophorectomy) 6. The following criteria apply to female and male participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
        a. Female participants of childbearing potential must use one form of highly effective&#xD;
        contraception. Hormonal methods must be in place from at least 2 weeks prior to the first&#xD;
        study visit. The contraception use must continue until 28 days after the date of viral&#xD;
        challenge. Highly effective contraception is as described below: i. Established use of&#xD;
        hormonal methods of contraception described below (for a minimum of 2 weeks prior to the&#xD;
        first study visit). When hormonal methods of contraception are used, male are required to&#xD;
        use a condom with a spermicide: ii. combined (oestrogen and progestogen containing)&#xD;
        hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. oral 2. intravaginal 3. transdermal iii. progestogen-only hormonal contraception&#xD;
        associated with inhibition of ovulation:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. oral&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. injectable&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. implantable iv. Intrauterine device (IUD) v. Intrauterine hormone-releasing system&#xD;
             (IUS) vi. Bilateral tubal ligation vii. Male sterilisation (with the appropriate post&#xD;
             vasectomy documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate) where the&#xD;
             vasectomised male is the sole partner for that woman.&#xD;
&#xD;
             viii. True abstinence - sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only&#xD;
             if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of&#xD;
             risk associated with the study treatments. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs&#xD;
             to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical study and the preferred&#xD;
             and usual lifestyle of the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
             b. Male participants must agree to the contraceptive requirements below from the&#xD;
             vaccination visit and continue until 28 days after the date of Viral challenge: i. Use&#xD;
             a condom with a spermicide to prevent pregnancy in a female partner or to prevent&#xD;
             exposure of any partner (male and female) to the IMP.&#xD;
&#xD;
             ii. Male sterilisation with the appropriate post vasectomy documentation of the&#xD;
             absence of sperm in the ejaculate (please note that the use of condom with spermicide&#xD;
             will still be required to prevent partner exposure). This applies only to males&#xD;
             participating in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             iii. In addition, for female partners of childbearing potential, that partner must use&#xD;
             another form of contraception such as one of the highly effective methods mentioned&#xD;
             above for female participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
             i. True abstinence - sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if&#xD;
             defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk&#xD;
             associated with the study treatments. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be&#xD;
             evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical study and the preferred and&#xD;
             usual lifestyle of the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
             c. In addition to the contraceptive requirements above, male participants must agree&#xD;
             not to donate sperm following discharge from Quarantine until 28 days after the date&#xD;
             of Viral Challenge/last dosing with IMP (whichever occurs last).&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. And/or other major disease that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may put the&#xD;

             nasal assessments or viral challenge, (historical nasal polyps can be included, but&#xD;
             large nasal polyps causing current and significant symptoms and/or requiring regular&#xD;
             treatments in the last month will be excluded).&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Any clinically significant history of epistaxis (large nosebleeds) within the last 3&#xD;
             months of the first study visit and/or history of being hospitalized due to epistaxis&#xD;
