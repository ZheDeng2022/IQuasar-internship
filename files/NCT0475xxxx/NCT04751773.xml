    <textblock>
      Surgery is a primary treatment modality in the intended curative treatment of colorectal&#xD;
      liver metastases (CRLM). However, surgery elicits a cascade of potentially detrimental stress&#xD;
      responses that may drive the onset of long-term disease progression. Exercise training is&#xD;
      emerging as an adjunct treatment in surgical oncology and holds potential to modify the&#xD;
      surgical stress response. Against this background, we designed the present randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial to evaluate the therapeutic role of pre- and postoperative exercise training&#xD;
      in patients with CRLM undergoing open liver resection.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Colorectal cancer is the third most frequent type of cancer in Denmark, with more than 5000&#xD;
      new cases annually. Colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) develop in nearly one fourth of all&#xD;
      patients with colorectal cancer, and poses a poor prognostic outlook, with low survival rates&#xD;
      and short time to disease progression. Surgical resection, either upfront or following&#xD;
      downstaging with perioperative treatments, confers substantial survival benefit in patients&#xD;
      with CRLM, and may even comprise a curative treatment modality. However, surgery elicits a&#xD;
      cascade of biological responses characterized by increased dissemination of tumor cells and&#xD;
      modulation of neuroendocrine, inflammatory, and immunological factors. These local and&#xD;
      systemic perturbations typically persist for days to weeks following surgery and may&#xD;
      independently or in concert drive the onset of long-term disease progression. Under normal&#xD;
      physiological conditions, exercise training is a potent modulator of immune function,&#xD;
      systemic inflammation, and the neuroendocrine system, raising the possibility that&#xD;
      perioperative exercise training may ameliorate the surgical stress response during and after&#xD;
      surgery. However, in a recent systematic review and meta-analysis (submitted), we found that&#xD;
      the effects and safety of preoperative and early postoperative exercise are unknown in&#xD;
      patients with gastrointestinal cancers (including CRLM) due to lack of studies, widespread&#xD;
      methodological issues, and poor ascertainment and reporting of adverse events. Safety is&#xD;
      arguably the single most important consideration for the application perioperative exercise,&#xD;
      and methodological robust trials evaluating the safety and tolerability of perioperative&#xD;
      exercise training along with preliminary information on treatment efficacy are needed to&#xD;
      inform the application of exercise in surgical oncology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Against this background, we designed the present randomized controlled trial to evaluate the&#xD;
      therapeutic role of pre- and postoperative exercise training in patients with CRLM undergoing&#xD;
      open liver resection. The primary trial objective and hypothesis are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare the effect of standard care and perioperative exercise (EX) vs. standard care&#xD;
           alone (CON) on the incidence of postoperative complications in patients with CRLM&#xD;
           undergoing surgery. We hypothesize that the incidence of postoperative complications is&#xD;
           non-inferior in EX vs. CON&#xD;
&#xD;
           The key secondary study objectives and hypotheses are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare the effect of EX vs. CON on length of postoperative stay and incidence of&#xD;
           pre- and postoperative hospital admissions in patients with CRLM undergoing surgery. We&#xD;
           hypothesize that the length of postoperative stay and incidence of pre- and&#xD;
           postoperative hospital admissions are non-inferior in EX vs. CON&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To compare the effect of EX vs. CON on relative dose intensity of adjuvant chemotherapy&#xD;
           and time from surgery to initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with CRLM&#xD;
           undergoing surgery. We hypothesize that the relative dose intensity of adjuvant&#xD;
           chemotherapy and time from surgery to initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy are&#xD;
           non-inferior in EX vs. CON.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To compare the effect of EX vs. CON on selected patient-reported symptomatic adverse&#xD;
           events in patients with CRLM undergoing surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To compare the effect of EX vs. CON on surgical stress responses (neuroendocrine,&#xD;
           inflammatory, and immune factors) in patients with CRLM undergoing surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The secondary study objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To evaluate the feasibility of EX.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. To compare the effect of EX vs. CON on functional capacity, muscle strength, aerobic&#xD;
           capacity, and body composition in patients with CRLM undergoing surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. To compare the effect of EX vs. CON on clinical outcomes in patients with CRLM&#xD;
           undergoing surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. To compare the effect of EX vs. CON on patient-reported outcomes in patients with CRLM&#xD;
           undergoing surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. To compare the effect of EX vs. CON on circulating tumor DNA and DNA methylation in&#xD;
           patients with CRLM undergoing surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. To evaluate the effects of acute pre- and postoperative exercise on neuroendocrine,&#xD;
           immunological, and inflammatory factors in patients with CRLM undergoing surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. To conduct explorative preclinical sub-studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRIAL DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial is a single-center, randomized, controlled, parallel-group trial performed at&#xD;
      Centre for physical Activity (CFAS), Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark, and Department of&#xD;
      Surgical Gastroenterology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 60 participants with CRLM will be included and randomly allocated 2:1 to standard&#xD;
      care and perioperative exercise training (EX) or standard care alone (CON) stratified by&#xD;
      major (â‰¥3 segments)/minor (&lt;3 segments) surgery. The participants will undergo a total of&#xD;
      three trial visits at CFAS: Two pre-surgery (after inclusion and 2-3 days before surgery) and&#xD;
      1 post-surgery (8 weeks after discharge). For each visit, the participants will be assessed&#xD;
      for body composition and anthropometrics, resting cardiovascular factors, standard blood&#xD;
      biochemistry, aerobic capacity (VO2peak, ventilatory threshold), maximal muscle strength, and&#xD;
      functional performance. In addition, blood samples will be taken before, during, and&#xD;
      immediately after surgery, and on post-operative day 1, 2, 3, and 15 and neuroendocrine,&#xD;
      inflammatory, and immune factor will be analyzed. Patient-reported outcomes will be collected&#xD;
      at all trial visits and 1, 2, and 3 years after randomization. Data from medical records&#xD;
      regarding mortality and disease recurrence will be collected up to 3 years after&#xD;
      randomization. As an optional procedure, we will collect blood samples before, during, and&#xD;
      after a pre- and a postoperative supervised exercise training session.&#xD;

The preoperative exercise consists of supervised exercise (high-intensity resistance and aerobic exercise 3 times/week) and unsupervised exercise (continuous moderate-intensity 45 min aerobic exercise 2 times/week). The duration of the preoperative exercise intervention depends on the length of the preoperative period (expectedly 2-6 weeks).&#xD;
The postoperative exercise training program consists of 8 weeks of supervised exercise (resistance and aerobic exercise 3 times/week) and unsupervised exercise (aerobic exercise 2 times/week). The intensity and duration are progressively increased during the postoperative period</description>
