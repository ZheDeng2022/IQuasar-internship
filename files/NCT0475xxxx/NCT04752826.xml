      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Phase 1/2a, dose-escalation, multicenter, first-in-human, consecutive-cohort,&#xD;
      open-label study of BI-1808, as a single agent and in combination with pembrolizumab in&#xD;
      subjects with advanced malignancies, whose disease has progressed after standard therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the purpose of this study, subjects with advanced malignancies includes subjects with&#xD;
      advanced solid tumors (where iRECIST can be applied for efficacy assessment) and subjects&#xD;
      with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), specifically Sézary Syndrome (SS) and mycosis&#xD;
      fungoides (MF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of 2 phases: a Phase 1 with Parts A and B, and a Phase 2a with Parts A&#xD;
      and B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the purpose of making dose-escalation decisions, DLTs will be evaluated from the first&#xD;
      dose through Day 22. Data will be regularly reviewed by the SMC; the outcome of these reviews&#xD;
      will drive the dose-escalation process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      b Subjects in the first cohort of Phase 1, Part B will be administered BI-1808 at the&#xD;
      single-agent dose level of RP2D 1 (1 dose level lower than the sRP2D) as the starting dose.&#xD;
      Thereafter, escalation (or de-escalation) will follow the same rules as those of Phase 1,&#xD;
      Part A of the trial, according to the mTPI-2 design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects participating in the trial will complete a follow-up portion of the trial and an&#xD;
      End of Treatment (EOT) Visit 30 days (±3 days) after their last dose of BI-1808.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1, Parts A and B of the trial will recruit patients with all types of malignancies&#xD;
      whose tumors have progressed after standard anticancer treatment and who meet the&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria. A minimum number of subjects with non-small-cell lung cancer&#xD;
      (NSCLC), ovarian cancer (OC), and CTCL may be included in the Phase 1 (dose escalation) part&#xD;
      of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For any subjects with CTCL included in Phase 1, Parts A and B of the study, efficacy&#xD;
      assessments will be performed as detailed for Phase 2a, Part A - Cohort 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1, Part A consists of a dose-escalation phase, using the modified toxicity probability&#xD;
      interval dose-escalation design, version 2 (mTPI 2) for selection of the single-agent&#xD;
      recommended Phase 2 dose (sRP2D).&#xD;
&#xD;
      An underlying target DLT rate of 30% will be applied for the decision-making rules of the&#xD;
      mTPI 2 design and to determine an sRP2D for BI-1808.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase 1, Part A, consecutive cohorts of subjects with all types of malignancies will&#xD;
      receive IV infusions of ascending doses of BI-1808 at the doses of 25 mg, 75 mg, 225 mg, and&#xD;
      675 mg, every 3 weeks (Q3W). Six additional subjects will receive BI-1808 at the sRP2D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in Phase 1, Part A will initially receive 3 doses of therapy with BI-1808 (ie,&#xD;
      administered on Day 1 [Week 1], Day 22 [Week 4], and Day 43 [Week 7]). During this period,&#xD;
      subjects will undergo PK, pharmacodynamic, and safety assessments at regular intervals. For&#xD;
      the purpose of making dose escalation decisions, DLTs will be evaluated from the first dose&#xD;
      through Day 22. Data will be regularly reviewed by a Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC), the&#xD;
      outcome of these reviews will drive the dose escalation process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data obtained in Phase 1, Part A will be used to inform the BI-1808 dose to be taken&#xD;
      forward for the Phase 2a expansion phase of the trial. In order to determine the sRP2D, and&#xD;
      upon recommendation of the SMC, additional cohorts with intermediate doses or regimens can be&#xD;
      added in Phase 1. In the event that available PK and pharmacodynamic results are compelling,&#xD;
      an optimal therapeutic dose can be estimated, and upon recommendation by the SMC, Phase 1 of&#xD;
      the trial may be stopped and the Phase 2a part of the trial can begin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who show clinical benefit (CR, PR or SD) at the Week 9 Visit shall continue on&#xD;
      therapy with BI-1808. Starting at Week 10, these subjects will receive infusions every 3&#xD;
      weeks (±3 days) for up to 14 additional doses or up to 1 year from first dose of BI-1808&#xD;
      therapy, whichever comes first, or until PD or unacceptable toxicity. Subjects with PD at the&#xD;
      Week 9 Visit may continue on therapy until a confirmatory scan is performed at least 4 weeks&#xD;
      after the Week 9 scan. If PD is not confirmed, the subject shall continue on treatment; if PD&#xD;
      is confirmed, the subject will be discontinued from the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects completing the initial treatment period with PD at the Week 9 assessment (confirmed&#xD;
      by scan at least 4 weeks later), will be discontinued from treatment and the EOT Visit will&#xD;
      be performed within 30 days (±3 days) after the Week 9 Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase 1, Part B of the trial, additional subjects with all types of malignancies will be&#xD;
      enrolled and the safety and tolerability profile of the combination of BI-1808 with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab will be assessed. Successive cohorts will receive an ascending dose of BI-1808&#xD;
      in combination with pembrolizumab at the standard dose of 200 mg. The pembrolizumab infusion&#xD;
      will be given before the BI-1808 infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in the first cohort of Phase 1, Part B will be administered BI-1808 at the dose&#xD;
      level of sRP2D 1 (1 dose level lower than the sRP2D) as the starting dose, in combination&#xD;
      with pembrolizumab 200 mg. Thereafter, escalation (or de-escalation) will follow the same&#xD;
      rules as those of Phase 1, Part A of the trial, according to the mTPI-2 design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Phase 1, Part B, and for the purpose of making dose-escalation decisions, the DLT period&#xD;
      will be evaluated through Day 43.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose-escalation and confirmation of the recommended Phase 2 dose for BI-1808 in combination&#xD;
      with pembrolizumab (cRP2D) of BI-1808 in combination with pembrolizumab will end using the&#xD;
      same rules as in Phase 1, Part A. Once the cRP2D of the BI-1808 in combination with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab treatment has been determined, Cohort 4 of Phase 2a Part B may begin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who show clinical benefit (CR, PR or SD) at the Week 9 Visit shall continue&#xD;
      treatment with BI-808 in combination with pembrolizumab. Starting at Week 10, these subjects&#xD;
      will receive infusions every 3 weeks (±3 days) for up to 14 additional doses or up to 1 year&#xD;
      from first dose of BI-1808 therapy, whichever comes first, or until PD or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity. Subjects with PD at the Week 9 Visit may continue on combination therapy until a&#xD;
      confirmatory scan is performed at least 4 weeks after the Week 9 scan. If PD is not&#xD;
      confirmed, the subject shall continue on treatment; if PD is confirmed, the subject will be&#xD;
      discontinued from the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects completing the initial treatment period with PD at the Week 9 assessment (confirmed&#xD;
      by scan at least 4 weeks later), will be discontinued from treatment and the EOT Visit will&#xD;
      be performed within 30 days (±3 days) after the Week 9 Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2a, Part A consists of 3 expansion cohorts of 12 subjects each: expansion Cohorts 1 and&#xD;
      2 will enroll subjects with NSCLC, and OC respectively. Additional cohorts with other&#xD;
      specified malignancy types may be enrolled, based on Phase 1 results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in these cohorts will be treated at the sRP2D of BI-1808 (as a single agent), as&#xD;
      determined in Phase 1, Part A. Subjects will receive IV infusions of BI-1808 administered on&#xD;
      Day 1 [Week 1], Day 22 [Week 4], and Day 43 [Week 7].&#xD;
&#xD;
      From Week 1 until Week 9 subjects will undergo PK, pharmacodynamic, and safety assessments at&#xD;
      regular intervals. At the Week 9 Visit, subjects will also undergo disease response&#xD;
      assessments to determine the potential clinical benefit (CR, PR, or SD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who show clinical benefit (CR, PR or SD) at the Week 9 Visit shall continue on&#xD;
      BI-1808 therapy. Starting at Week 10, these subjects will receive infusions every 3 weeks (±3&#xD;
      days) for up to 14 additional doses or up to 1 year from first dose of BI-1808 therapy,&#xD;
      whichever comes first, or until PD or unacceptable toxicity. Subjects with PD at the Week 9&#xD;
      Visit may continue on therapy until a confirmatory scan is performed at least 4 weeks after&#xD;
      the Week 9 scan. If PD is not confirmed, the subject shall continue on treatment; if PD is&#xD;
      confirmed, the subject will be discontinued from the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase 2a, Part A, expansion Cohort 3 will study the activity of BI-1808 as a single agent&#xD;
      in subjects with CTCL (specifically MF or SS). Subjects in this cohort will initially receive&#xD;
      3 doses of therapy with BI-1808 (ie, administered on Day 1 [Week 1], Day 22 [Week 4], and Day&#xD;
      43 [Week 7]). From Week 1 until Week 9 subjects will undergo PK, pharmacodynamic, and safety&#xD;
      assessments at regular intervals. At the Week 9 Visit, subjects will also undergo disease&#xD;
      response assessments to determine the potential clinical benefit (CR, PR or SD) of the&#xD;
      combination therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all subjects with CTCL, the modified Severity Weighted Assessment Tool (mSWAT) (Olsen et&#xD;
      al 2011) will be used for quantitative assessment of disease burden in the skin of all&#xD;
      subjects, and blood samples will be collected for circulating Sézary cells. The presence or&#xD;
      absence of measurable (extracutaneous) disease will be determined from the computed&#xD;
      tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan performed at Screening/Baseline. For&#xD;
      subjects with CTCL with nonmeasurable disease, subsequent scans will occur only at the&#xD;
      discretion of the Investigator (eg, if there is a suggestion of new nodal or visceral&#xD;
      involvement during the study). Subjects in Cohort 3 with measurable (extracutaneous) disease&#xD;
      will have a CT/MRI scan at the Week 9 Visit (can be performed within 1 week prior to the Week&#xD;
      9 visit). For subjects with measurable (extracutaneous) disease who continue in the trial, a&#xD;
      CT scan will be performed every third BI-1808 dose (ie, every 9 weeks [±1 week] after Week&#xD;
      10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who show clinical benefit (CR, PR, or SD) at the Week 9 Visit shall continue on&#xD;
      BI-1808 therapy. Starting at Week 10, these subjects will receive infusions every 3 weeks (±3&#xD;
      days) for up to 14 additional doses or up to 1 year from first dose of BI-1808 therapy,&#xD;
      whichever comes first. Subjects with PD at the Week 9 Visit may continue on therapy until a&#xD;
      confirmatory scan is performed at least 4 weeks after the Week 9 scan. If PD is not&#xD;
      confirmed, the subject shall continue on treatment; if PD is confirmed, the subject will be&#xD;
      discontinued from the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects completing the initial treatment period with PD at the Week 9 assessment (confirmed&#xD;
      by scan at least 4 weeks later), will be discontinued from treatment and the EOT Visit will&#xD;
      be performed within 30 days (±3 days) after the Week 9 Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase 2a, Part B expansion Cohorts 4 and 5 will explore the activity of BI-1808 in&#xD;
      combination with pembrolizumab in subjects with NSCLC (Cohort 4) or OC (Cohort 5). Additional&#xD;
      cohorts with other specified malignancy types may be enrolled, based on Phase 1, Part B&#xD;
      results. These cohorts will only be opened when the cRP2D of the combination therapy (BI-1808&#xD;
      in combination with pembrolizumab) has been determined (Phase 1, Part B). Subjects in these&#xD;
      cohorts will receive IV infusions of BI-1808 administered on Day 1 [Week 1], Day 22 [Week 4],&#xD;
      and Day 43 [Week 7], in combination with 200 mg of pembrolizumab on the same days. The&#xD;
      pembrolizumab infusion will be given before the BI-1808 infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From Week 1 until Week 9, subjects will undergo PK, pharmacodynamic, and safety assessments&#xD;
      at regular intervals. At the Week 9 Visit, subjects will also undergo disease response&#xD;
      assessments to determine the potential clinical benefit (CR, PR or SD) of the combination&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who show clinical benefit (CR, PR or SD) at the Week 9 Visit shall continue on&#xD;
      combination therapy (BI-1808 in combination with pembrolizumab). Starting at Week 10, these&#xD;
      subjects will receive infusions every 3 weeks (±3 days) for up to 14 additional doses or up&#xD;
      to 1 year from first dose of BI-1808 therapy, whichever comes first, or until PD or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. Subjects with PD at the Week 9 Visit may continue on combination&#xD;
      therapy until a confirmatory scan is performed at least 4 weeks after the Week 9 scan. If PD&#xD;
      is not confirmed, the subject shall continue on treatment; if PD is confirmed, the subject&#xD;
      will be discontinued from the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects completing the initial treatment period with PD at the Week 9 assessment (confirmed&#xD;
      by scan at least 4 weeks later), will be discontinued from treatment and the EOT Visit will&#xD;
      be performed within 30 days (±3 days) after the Week 9 Visit.&#xD;
