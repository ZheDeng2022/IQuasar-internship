      This is a Phase 2a, multicenter, open-label uncontrolled study aimed at determining&#xD;
      therapeutic benefits of the addition of ibrutinib to venetoclax in patients with&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory CLL based on a MRD-guided approach.&#xD;

      Venetoclax will be administered, initially as single agent, orally once daily (QD), starting&#xD;
      with 20 mg on Day 1, followed by weekly dose escalation up to 400 mg, if well tolerated&#xD;
      [Ramp-up Period, according to the modified Venetoclax schedule in Phase 2 and 3 clinical&#xD;
      trials] and continued thereafter. At Cycle 12 Day 1, disease status, renal function and risk&#xD;
      of bleeding will be assessed. Minimal residual disease (MRD) in the peripheral blood will be&#xD;
      evaluated in patients with CR or PR by flow cytometry. All MRD negative subjects (defined as&#xD;
      those with MRD level in the PB &lt;10-4 in the PB and in the BM aspirate) will discontinue&#xD;
      venetoclax at the end of Cycle 12 (i.e. Cycle 12 Day 28). All MRD positive subjects (defined&#xD;
      as those with MRD level in the PB &gt;10-4) and patients with stable disease without any&#xD;
      contraindications to ibrutinib treatment will continue venetoclax and start treatment with&#xD;
      ibrutinib at the standard dose for CLL of 420 mg QD. Venetoclax will be administered until&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity or disease progression or for a maximum of 2 years and ibrutinib will&#xD;
      be continued until unacceptable toxicity, confirmed MRD negativity, or disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRD will be assessed every 3 months starting 3 months after treatment initiation; MRD&#xD;
      negativity at Cycle 12 Day 1 will be evaluated in PB BM aspirate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients experiencing clinical disease progression will discontinue study treatment and will&#xD;
      be followed up for survival status and subsequent anti-cancer therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        5. Uncontrolled autoimmune hemolytic anemia or immune thrombocytopenia&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Requires the use of warfarin, marcumar, or phenprocoumon (potential drug-drug&#xD;
           interaction increasing exposure of warfarin or phenprocoumon): low molecular weight&#xD;
           drugs e.g. heparin are acceptable&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Treatment, administration or consumption of any of the following within 3 days prior to&#xD;
           the first dose of venetoclax (see also Appendix G).&#xD;

&#xD;
             2. Moderate CYP3A inhibitors&#xD;

           antibody, hepatitis B surface antigen, or hepatitis C antibody must have a negative&#xD;
           polymerase chain reaction (PCR) result before enrollment. Those who are PCR positive&#xD;
           will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
             1. Malignancy treated with curative intent and with no known active disease present&#xD;
                for ≥3 years before the first dose of study drug and felt to be at low risk for&#xD;
                recurrence by treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer or lentigo maligna without evidence of&#xD;
                disease.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Updated International Workshop on CLL (IWCLL, Hallek et al. 2008) criteria will be used to&#xD;
      determine rates of response and progression for patients with CLL with the modification to&#xD;
      exclude lymphocytosis as an isolated criterion of progression in patients treated with agents&#xD;
      inhibiting B-cell receptor signaling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint objective response rate (MRD negativity) as well as secondary efficacy&#xD;
      endpoints (e.g. ORR, PR, CR, PFS) will be derived from Investigator assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who reach a complete and partial response, as per standard criteria, will be&#xD;
      investigated using MRD testing for molecular response categories as described in IWCLL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety and tolerability of study drug treatments will be evaluated by means of AEs&#xD;
      (incidence and severity), performance status, physical examinations, 12-lead resting&#xD;
      electrocardiograms (ECGs), and laboratory safety evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory and AE toxicities will be graded according to National Cancer Institute (NCI)&#xD;
      Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.03.&#xD;
&#xD;
      biomarker assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Whole exome sequencing on leukemic samples before, during and after treatment and/or at&#xD;
           relapse in order to dissect mechanisms of resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  High-throughput sequencing for MRD detection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biochemical assays on the circulating leukemic population during ibrutinib treatment to&#xD;
           study activation of signaling pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical considerations According to optimal Simon Two-Stage Phase 2 design, with the null&#xD;
      hypothesis (P0) of a MRD-negative CR at 12 months of 5%, this study will consider a&#xD;
      satisfactory efficacy of the venetoclax + ibrutinib combination worth of further&#xD;
      investigation a P1 corresponding to a MRD-negative CR of 30%. Considering a standard type I&#xD;
      error (α) of 0.05 and a power of 95%, 29 MRD positive patients will be necessary for the&#xD;
      expansion phase of the trial. A first step analysis will be implemented when 9 MRD positive&#xD;
      patients have been enrolled and study will proceed to complete the planned accrual if at&#xD;
      least 1/9 patients will obtain a MRD negative CR at 12 months after starting Ibrutinib.&#xD;
      Considering that 5% of patients are expected to reach a MRD negative CR with venetoclax&#xD;
      alone, the target population to be enrolled into the trial is 31 patients.&#xD;
