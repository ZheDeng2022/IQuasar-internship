  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial investigates the effect of irinotecan liposome and bevacizumab in&#xD;
      treating patients with ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer that shows less&#xD;
      response to platinum therapy (platinum resistant), has come back (recurrent), or does not&#xD;
      respond to treatment (refractory). Irinotecan liposome may help block the formation of&#xD;
      growths that may become cancer. Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody that may interfere with&#xD;
      the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving irinotecan liposome and bevacizumab may&#xD;
      kill more cancer cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the antineoplastic efficacy of irinotecan sucrosofate (irinotecan liposome) in&#xD;
      combination with bevacizumab in women with recurrent, platinum resistant ovarian cancer, as&#xD;
      measured by the objective response rate (ORR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY EFFICACY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the overall best response per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors&#xD;
      (RECIST) 1.1 in women with recurrent, platinum resistant ovarian cancer who have received&#xD;
      treatment with irinotecan liposome in combination with bevacizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the clinical benefit rate (CBR) for irinotecan liposome in combination with&#xD;
      bevacizumab in women with recurrent, platinum resistant ovarian cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To calculate the duration of response (DOR) for irinotecan liposome in combination with&#xD;
      bevacizumab in women with recurrent, platinum resistant ovarian cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To calculate the duration of stable disease (duration of SD) for irinotecan liposome in&#xD;
      combination with bevacizumab in women with recurrent, platinum resistant ovarian cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To calculate the time to response (TTR) for irinotecan liposome in combination with&#xD;
      bevacizumab in women with recurrent, platinum resistant ovarian cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To measure median progression-free survival (PFS) in women with recurrent, platinum&#xD;
      resistant ovarian cancer who have received treatment with irinotecan liposome in combination&#xD;
      with bevacizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To measure 16 week progression-free survival (PFS-16) in women with recurrent, platinum&#xD;
      resistant ovarian cancer who have received treatment with irinotecan liposome in combination&#xD;
      with bevacizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY SAFETY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the toxicity profile of irinotecan liposome in combination with bevacizumab in&#xD;
      women with recurrent, platinum resistant ovarian cancer according to National Cancer&#xD;
      Institute (NCI)-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v)5.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive bevacizumab intravenously (IV) and irinotecan sucrosofate IV over 90 minutes&#xD;
      on days 1 and 15. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 3 months for&#xD;
      1 year, and then every 6 months for 2 years.&#xD;
