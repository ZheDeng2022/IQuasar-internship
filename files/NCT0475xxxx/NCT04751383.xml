    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is to find out the best dose, possible benefits and/or side effects of&#xD;
      magrolimab in combination with dinutuximab in treating patients with neuroblastoma that has&#xD;
      come back (relapsed) or does not respond to treatment (refractory) or relapsed osteosarcoma.&#xD;
      Magrolimab and dinutuximab are monoclonal antibodies that may interfere with the ability of&#xD;
      tumor cells to grow and spread. The combination of magrolimab and dinutuximab may shrink or&#xD;
      stabilize relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma or relapsed osteosarcoma. In addition, this&#xD;
      trial may help researchers find out if it is safe to give magrolimab and dinutuximab after&#xD;
      surgery to remove tumors from the lungs.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the safety and tolerability of Hu5F9-G4 (magrolimab) in combination with&#xD;
      dinutuximab in children and young adults with relapsed/refractory (R/R) neuroblastoma (NBL)&#xD;
      or relapsed osteosarcoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of Hu5F9-G4 (magrolimab) given in&#xD;
      combination with dinutuximab in children and young adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Determine the safety and feasibility of administering Hu5F9-G4 (magrolimab) in&#xD;
      combination with dinutuximab to patients that undergo pulmonary resection of metastatic&#xD;
      osteosarcoma within three weeks of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) of Hu5F9-G4 (magrolimab) in children and young adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Evaluate the event free survival (EFS) in two cohorts of patients who are treated at the&#xD;
      recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) (measurable relapsed osteosarcoma and patients with pulmonary&#xD;
      relapse undergoing resection) and compare to historical controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Observe and record anti-tumor activity. IV. Evaluate the overall response rate (ORR) of&#xD;
      patients in the NBL cohorts (measurable R/R NBL and evaluable R/R NBL) and osteosarcoma&#xD;
      patients (measurable relapsed osteosarcoma) in the expansion cohorts treated at the RP2D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To explore biomarkers of response and resistance including genomic (CD47 expression, Fc&#xD;
      receptor [FcR] polymorphisms, SIRPa polymorphisms, and KiR phenotype) and immunologic&#xD;
      (dinutuximab HACA, magrolimab ADA, peripheral and bone marrow immune subsets, and circulating&#xD;
      cytokines).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To explore biomarkers of response in the tumor microenvironment through multiplexed ion&#xD;
      beam imaging (MIBI) on resected tissue or archival tissues including comparison of pre- and&#xD;
      post- treatment tumor tissues from patients undergoing staged resection of pulmonary&#xD;
      osteosarcoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose de-escalation study of magrolimab with fixed-dose dinutuximab&#xD;
      followed by a dose-expansion study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A: Patients receive magrolimab intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days 1, 8, and 15 of&#xD;
      cycles 1-2 and days 1 and 15 of subsequent cycles, and dinutuximab IV over 10 hours on days&#xD;
      2-5. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 12 cycles in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B: Patients receive magrolimab IV over 2 hours on days 1, 8, and 15 of cycles 1-2 and&#xD;
      days 1 and 15 of subsequent cycles, and dinutuximab IV over 10 hours on days 2-5. Treatment&#xD;
      repeats every 21 days for up to 12 cycles in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients with pulmonary osteosarcoma may undergo surgical resection of&#xD;
      tumor after cycle 1. After surgery, these patients continue receiving magrolimab and&#xD;
      dinutuximab every 21 days for up to 5 cycles in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, at 2, 4, 6, 9, and&#xD;
      12 months, and then yearly for 4 years.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  The effects of Hu5F9-G4 (magrolimab) monoclonal antibody on the developing human fetus&#xD;
             are unknown and dinutuximab is known to be teratogenic. For this reason, female&#xD;
             patients of childbearing potential must be willing to use one highly effective method&#xD;
             of contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to&#xD;

                  during the study and for 4 months after the last dose of study treatment. If the&#xD;
                  partner is pregnant, male patients must use barrier method contraception (condom)&#xD;
                  during the study and for 4 months after the last dose of study treatment to&#xD;
                  prevent fetal exposure to study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients and/or their parents or legally authorized representatives must have the&#xD;
             ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent. Assent,&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to anti-GD2 monoclonal antibody (dinutuximab) or Hu5F9-G4 (magrolimab)&#xD;
             monoclonal antibody or other agents used in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;

             study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because Hu5F9-G4 (magrolimab) is a&#xD;
             monoclonal antibody on the developing human fetus are unknown and dinutuximab may&#xD;
             cause fetal harm. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in&#xD;
             nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with Hu5F9-G4 (magrolimab) or&#xD;
             dinutuximab, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with&#xD;
