  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pyoderma Gangrenosum (PG) is a rapidly progressive disease and presents as painful, single or&#xD;
      multiple lesions, with several clinical variants, in different locations, with a nonspecific&#xD;
      histology, which makes the diagnosis challenging and often delayed. The main objective of&#xD;
      this study is to estimate the incidence proportion of all the infection reported as adverse&#xD;
      drug reaction (ADR) of Humira with PG participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Humira is the only drug approved for the treatment of Pyoderma Gangrenosum (PG) in Japan.&#xD;
      Approximately 60 adult participants with PG at approximately 60 sites in Japan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive injectable Humira (Adalimumab) as prescribed by the physician prior&#xD;
      to enrolling in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There may be a higher burden for participants in this study compared to standard of care.&#xD;
      Participants will attend regular visits per routine clinical practice. The effect of the&#xD;
      treatment will be checked by medical assessments, checking for side effects, and by verbal&#xD;
      interview.&#xD;
