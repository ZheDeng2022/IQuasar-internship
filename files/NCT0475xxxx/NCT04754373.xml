  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, a lipase -sourced from a nonpyrogenic yeast, Candida rugosa, will be&#xD;
      investigated to establish optimal TG levels in adults in a 12-week supplementation period.&#xD;
      The investigational product provides a lipase formulation that is stable and active in acidic&#xD;
      and neutral pH environments, while also fully digesting TGs into free fatty acids and&#xD;
      glycerol which is beyond the scope of pancreatic lipase (Schuler et al. 2012). This will be a&#xD;
      novel study investigating the effects of C. rugosa lipase on adults with slightly elevated TG&#xD;
      levels.&#xD;
