  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neoadjuvant treatment is an important treatment for early breast cancer patients. Patients&#xD;
      with her2 enriched subtype who achieved pCR after neoadjuvant treatment would have longer&#xD;
      survival. The neoadjuvant treatment for her2 positive patients include chemotherapy and&#xD;
      targeted therapy. Although the pCR rate was high to 60% after use of trastuzumab and&#xD;
      pertuzumab, but the adverse reaction of combined chemotherapy could not be negligible. Some&#xD;
      studies have attempted chemotherapy-free treatment for her2 positive patients during&#xD;
      neoadjuvant therapy. But, which patient could be exempted from chemotherapy and which drug&#xD;
      could be omitted are still unknow before treatment. Drug sensitivity screening in vitro was a&#xD;
      promising method for choosing chemotherapy. But there was no method could select effective&#xD;
      drugs accurately for breast cancer patients until now.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previously, investigators developed a patient-derived tumor-like cell clusters in vitro&#xD;
      culture technology. Feasibility for guiding clinical treatment by drug sensitivity screening&#xD;
      based on this technology have been explored by preliminary exploration with a well&#xD;
      corresponding. And the results have been published. This study will explore whether drug&#xD;
      screening in vitro patient-derived tumor-like cell clusters from breast cancer tissue could&#xD;
      be a metheod for omitting chemotherapy for her2 positive participants.&#xD;

      Neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer could make unresectable breast cancer be&#xD;
      resectable and improve breast conservation rate. Patients with her2 enriched subtype who&#xD;
      achieved pCR after neoadjuvant treatment would have longer survival. The neoadjuvant&#xD;
      treatment for her2 positive patients include chemotherapy and targeted therapy. Although the&#xD;
      pCR rate was high to 60% after use of trastuzumab and pertuzumab, but the adverse reaction of&#xD;
      combined chemotherapy could not be negligible. Based on the application of dual targeted&#xD;
      drugs, some studies have attempted chemotherapy-free treatment for her2 positive patients&#xD;
      during neoadjuvant therapy. But, which patient could be exempted from chemotherapy and which&#xD;
      drug could be omitted are still unknow before treatment. Drug sensitivity screening in vitro&#xD;
      was a promising method for choosing chemotherapy. But there was no method could select&#xD;
      effective drugs accurately for breast cancer participants until now.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previously, investigators developed a patient-derived tumor-like cell clusters(PTC) in vitro&#xD;
      culture technology. It is a cell cluster including tumor cells, mesenchymal cells and&#xD;
      lymphocytes, which simulates the tumor microenvironment in vitro. In the preliminary&#xD;
      exploration, investigators included 35 early breast cancer participants, the corresponding&#xD;
      between in vitro drug sensitivity screening based on this technology and clinical treatment&#xD;
      results was well. The results have been published.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will focus on her2 positive early breast cancer participants. 46 participants will&#xD;
      be included. All of them will received in vitro drug sensitivity screenning upon PTC before&#xD;
      neoadjuvant therapy. All participants will received trastuzumab and pertuzumab. The choice of&#xD;
      chemotherapy drugs is determined based on the PTC drug sensitivity results. If single-agent&#xD;
      chemotherapy is effective in vitro, this drug will be the chemotherapy regimen for the&#xD;
      corresponding participants. This study expects that the pCR rate could achieve 60% in the&#xD;
      case of chemotherapy downgrading after in vitro drug sensitivity screening.&#xD;
