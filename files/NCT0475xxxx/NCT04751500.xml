  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pregnancy tissue can be found remaining in the womb in up to 20% of women following a&#xD;
      miscarriage. These &quot;retained products of conception&quot; (RPOC), which are diagnosed by&#xD;
      transvaginal ultrasound, can cause prolonged bleeding, pain, infection, impaired fertility&#xD;
      and therefore further psychological distress. Ineffective medical and surgical interventions&#xD;
      place considerable burden on affected women and utilise scarce health care resources.&#xD;
      Additionally, surgery is performed 'blindly' using a suction tube or metal curette where&#xD;
      risks include perforation of the womb and scarring of the womb lining, both of which lead to&#xD;
      delayed fertility and in the worst circumstances, infertility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no current guidance on how to best investigate and manage RPOC. New surgical&#xD;
      equipment allows RPOC removal under vision, using a specially designed telescope placed&#xD;
      inside the womb (hysteroscopy). This precise technique may more successfully and less&#xD;
      traumatically remove RPOC, minimising ongoing bleeding, the risk of womb perforation and scar&#xD;
      tissue formation, thereby reducing the risk of infertility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a pilot randomised controlled trial using routine transvaginal&#xD;
      ultrasound to diagnose RPOC in women who choose non-surgical management of a first-trimester&#xD;
      (≤14 weeks) miscarriage. This scan will be done 8 weeks post-miscarriage diagnosis. Women who&#xD;
      have RPOC on this scan will be randomised (in a 1:1 ratio) to receive outpatient hysteroscopy&#xD;
      ('OPH') or 'standard treatment' (expectant, medical, surgical and/or antibiotic treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women who had RPOC will be followed-up at 14 weeks after randomisation to explore clinical&#xD;
      outcomes (symptoms, quality of life) and use of additional healthcare resources (e.g.&#xD;
      additional investigations / treatments / hospitalisations). All patients, no matter whether&#xD;
      they were diagnosed with RPOC or not, will be followed up at 26 weeks and 52 weeks after&#xD;
      randomisation/ultrasound scan to determine clinical pregnancy rates and pregnancy outcomes.&#xD;
      All patients who have had a miscarriage or have not fallen pregnant since entering the trial&#xD;
      will be offered a hysteroscopy to see if there are any conditions affecting the womb lining&#xD;
      which may be contributing to pregnancy failure.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The diagnosis of retained products of conception (RPOC) following miscarriage causes&#xD;
      physiological and emotional stress to women and their partners. Additional hospital visits,&#xD;
      inpatient admissions and non-evidence-based treatments impose an additional burden on women&#xD;
      and healthcare services. Ineffective medical and surgical treatments can prolong symptoms&#xD;
      such as bleeding, pain and psychological distress which impacts adversely on quality of life.&#xD;
      In addition, future fertility can be delayed or worse, permanently impaired, because of&#xD;
      damage and scarring of the womb lining arising from chronic infection or mechanical trauma&#xD;
      after conventional 'blind' mechanical evacuation of the uterine cavity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent technological advances in hysteroscopy allow RPOC to be directly visualised and&#xD;
      simultaneously removed with greater precision and less trauma to the endometrium with&#xD;
      promising results. These 'hysteroscopic tissue removal systems' represent the latest advance&#xD;
      in uterine surgery. This technology allows complete excision and removal of intrauterine&#xD;
      pathology under direct vision, including removal of RPOC in the inpatient and more recently,&#xD;
      the outpatient setting with complete resection and resolution of symptoms without apparent&#xD;
      complications. Current evidence suggests that hysteroscopic resection of RPOC is associated&#xD;
      with the formation of less intrauterine adhesions, lower rates of incomplete evacuation, and&#xD;
      shorter time to subsequent conception, but is based on limited numbers of studies, too small&#xD;
      sample sizes to statistically detect differences between treatments, poor reporting of&#xD;
      confounders and the absence of randomised studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, there are no randomised controlled trials investigating the use of outpatient&#xD;
      hysteroscopy in the management of RPOC against standard treatment. The investigators&#xD;
      therefore aim to perform a pilot randomised control trial to assess the feasibility of&#xD;
      undertaking a future substantive full-scale trial to compare routine transvaginal ultrasound&#xD;
      scanning and outpatient hysteroscopy for the treatment of RPOC against current standard&#xD;
      practice to see if it is more effective in improving fertility and minimising symptomatic&#xD;
      morbidity. Furthermore, health service resource use will be evaluated against clinical&#xD;
      outcomes to determine the cost-effectiveness of this new pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All women who choose non-surgical management of a first trimester (≤14 weeks gestation)&#xD;
      miscarriage will be eligible for recruitment into the study, where informed consent will be&#xD;
      taken and baseline assessments will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients who then have RPOC diagnosed on transvaginal ultrasound scan (TVS) at 8 weeks&#xD;
      after the diagnosis of their miscarriage will then be randomised (in a 1:1 ratio) to receive&#xD;
      outpatient hysteroscopy ('OPH') or 'standard treatment'. At 'OPH', if RPOC are present, then&#xD;
      these will be removed on an intention-to-treat basis. If randomised to the 'standard&#xD;
      treatment' arm, management will be based according to current practice (expectant, medical,&#xD;
      antibiotic, surgical treatment). Immediately after OPH, all women will be asked to complete a&#xD;
      questionnaire exploring the acceptability of the procedure and clinicians will be asked to&#xD;
      complete a questionnaire exploring the efficacy of OPH in diagnosing and removing RPOC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For those who had RPOC, regardless of which treatment they were randomised to, face-to-face&#xD;
      consultations will be performed at 14 weeks post-randomisation. These will explore clinical&#xD;
      outcomes (symptoms and generic quality of life) and use of additional healthcare resources&#xD;
      (e.g. additional investigations / treatments / hospitalisations). All patients, no matter&#xD;
      whether they were diagnosed with RPOC or not, will be followed up at 26 weeks and 52 weeks&#xD;
      post-randomisation to determine clinical pregnancy rates and pregnancy outcomes. All patients&#xD;
      who have had a miscarriage or have not fallen pregnant since entering the trial will be&#xD;
      offered the chance to undergo a hysteroscopy to see if there is any scar tissue, chronic RPOC&#xD;
      or other conditions affecting the womb lining which may be contributing to pregnancy failure;&#xD;
      this data will be collected. At this point, patients will discharged from the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size of a future substantive study will partly be determined by the results of&#xD;
      this study. This study will aim to recruit 200 women to give a better idea of the number of&#xD;
      women with RPOC and the numbers willing to be recruited. After recruitment, the investigators&#xD;
      will aim to scan 200 women over a six-month period. Predicated upon a sonographic RPOC rate&#xD;
      of 20%, 40 women are expected to have RPOC; 20 women would be randomised to 'OPH' and 20&#xD;
      women to 'nOPH'.&#xD;
