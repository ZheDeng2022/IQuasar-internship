  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, multicenter study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravesical&#xD;
      administration of EG-70 and its effect on bladder tumors in patients with NMIBC who have&#xD;
      failed BCG therapy and are recommended for radical cystectomy or high-risk NMIBC patients who&#xD;
      are BCG-naïve or have received incomplete BCG treatment. This study study consists of two&#xD;
      phases, a dose-escalation Phase (Phase 1) to establish safety and recommended phase 2 dose&#xD;
      (RP2D), followed by a Phase 2 efficacy study at the RP2D to establish efficacy. Eligible&#xD;
      BCG-unresponsive NMIBC patients will be enrolled in Phase 1, and Cohort 1 of Phase 2.&#xD;
      Eligible high-risk NMIBC patients who have been incompletely treated or are BCG-naïve will be&#xD;
      enrolled starting in Phase 2 in a separate single-arm cohort (Cohort 2).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      EG-70 is a novel non-viral gene therapy. EG-70 is designed to elicit a local immune response&#xD;
      following delivery of gene therapies to mucosal tissues, such as the bladder urothelium. This&#xD;
      approach of local administration through bladder instillation has the potential to induce a&#xD;
      potent immune response exclusively at the site of the tumor, resulting in greater therapeutic&#xD;
      benefit while reducing undesirable systemic toxicity.&#xD;
