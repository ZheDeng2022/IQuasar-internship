  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to describe absolute lymphocyte count (ALC)&#xD;
      reconstitution after Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) discontinuation because of lymphopenia, in&#xD;
      Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS) participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the study are characterization of lymphopenia; characterization&#xD;
      of lymphopenia having led to DMF discontinuation treatment; description of the evolution of&#xD;
      ALC during DMF treatment; description of discontinuation of DMF treatment; exploration of&#xD;
      clinical outcomes in participants with lymphopenia on DMF and/or after DMF discontinuation&#xD;
      due to lymphopenia; description of vigilance and participant management overall and in&#xD;
      participants with lymphopenia who continued DMF treatment; incidence's assessment of&#xD;
      opportunistic or serious infections; investigation of the potential impact of baseline&#xD;
      demographic and disease characteristics in risk of developing lymphopenia while on DMF;&#xD;
      investigation of the potential impact of baseline demographics on the kinetics of ALC&#xD;
      reconstitution upon discontinuation of DMF; investigation of the changes of lymphocyte&#xD;
      subtypes in participants on DMF if available.&#xD;
