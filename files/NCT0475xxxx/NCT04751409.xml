  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how anxiety is affected by 2 types of follow-up after surgery,&#xD;
      limited follow-up and intense follow-up, in patients with stage II-III soft tissue sarcoma of&#xD;
      the trunk and extremities. In cancer survivors, the fear of cancer coming back (recurring) is&#xD;
      common and may persist long after the end of treatment. It may also be exacerbated by return&#xD;
      visits for imaging (surveillance). The purpose of this study is to determine how patients'&#xD;
      anxiety and other cancer-related outcomes are affected by how often surveillance is done.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate whether a risk-based limited follow-up surveillance is associated with reduced&#xD;
      patient anxiety compared to risk-based intense surveillance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the impact of reduced surveillance in low-risk patients on overall survival,&#xD;
      time to local or distant recurrence, anxiety at early and late time-points, out of pocket&#xD;
      costs, and number of missed or extra clinic visits, compared to the risk-based intense&#xD;
      follow-up in both low-risk and high-risk patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 groups based on risk status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP 1 (LOW RISK): Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients undergo intense follow-up every 3 months for 2 years consisting of restaging&#xD;
      with computed tomography (CT)-chest and imaging of the primary site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients undergo limited follow-up every 6 months for 2 years consisting of restaging&#xD;
      with either CT-chest or chest x-ray (CXR) and imaging of the primary site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP 2 (HIGH RISK): Patients undergo intense follow-up every 3 months for 2 years as in&#xD;
      Group 1, Arm I.&#xD;
