  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our primary aim of this study is to assess the impact of an early literacy text messaging&#xD;
      program (TipsByText, TbT) for parents of children between 3 to 4-years old during an office&#xD;
      visit without access to preschool. To assess this aim, our objectives are to specifically&#xD;
      assess (1) child literacy using the Phonological Awareness Literacy Screening Tool&#xD;
      (PALS-PreK) and (2) caregiver involvement using the Parent Child Interactivity Scale (PCI)&#xD;
      pre- and post-intervention, comparing with a control group not receiving the TipsByText&#xD;
      intervention. A secondary outcome of this study is to compare trust among families that&#xD;
      participate in the Tips by Text (TbT) Program with families that do not participate in TbT&#xD;
      using the Trust Evaluation Scale. Children will complete the PALS-PreK and caregivers of the&#xD;
      children will complete the PCI and Trust Evaluation Scales.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in child literacy measured by the Phonological Awareness Literacy Screening Tool (PALS-PreK) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and month 9</time_frame>
    <description>The PALS-PreK measures preschoolers' knowledge of literacy fundamentals: name writing, alphabet knowledge, sound awareness, print and word awareness, rhyme awareness, and nursery rhyme awareness. The English and Spanish PALS-PreK versions slightly differ in content, thus we standardized composite scores for both the pre and post score by language to allow fair comparisons. Lower-case alphabet recognition or letter sounds was not included in the total score for English or Spanish. Score range for English was 0 to 73 and for Spanish was 0 to 94, with higher score indicating better outcome</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in caregiver involvement measured by the Parent Child Interactivity Scale (PCI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and month 9</time_frame>
    <description>The Parent Child Interactivity Scale (PCI) uses parent self-assessment and a four-point Likert scale for five items assessing reading, such as &quot;Looked at pictures together in a book&quot;, and ten items assessing other literacy activities, such as &quot;Practiced rhyming words&quot;. We calculated scores for reading (PCI Read), for other activities (PCI Activities), and a composite score was calculated (PCI Total). Items ranged from 0 to 3 for 15 items, thus score ranged from 0 to 45, with higher score indicating better outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in parent trust in pediatricians using Wake Forest Physician Trust Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and month 9</time_frame>
    <description>Physician trust is measured by the sum of the 10 item scores (reverse-scored for negative items), ranging from 10 to 50, with a higher score indicating more trust.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Parents of participants must be last least 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Parents must be English and Spanish speaking, as the Tips by Text texting platform is&#xD;
             currently in those languages.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Child must be 3-5 years old at the time of their clinic visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Parent does not speak English or Spanish. This applies given that the texting&#xD;
             intervention has the capacity to be conducted in these two languages.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Parent does not have cell phone that would allow texting.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For the literacy texting intervention, the child must NOT be enrolled in Head&#xD;
             Start,Transitional Kindergarten or other subsidized preschool. Parents will be&#xD;
             provided with a list of preschools that would warrant exclusion. Childcare is ok. For&#xD;
             the trust and no-show evaluation arm, participants may be enrolled in any form of&#xD;
             early childhood education.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Child is currently receiving services for delay (speech, motor, or cognitive). If the&#xD;
             child briefly received services for delays over a year before start date of the study,&#xD;
             they are still eligible.&#xD;
