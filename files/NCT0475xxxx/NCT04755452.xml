  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Within all the surgical specialties, major surgeries are performed whenever possible, as&#xD;
      minimally invasive procedures to reduce blood loss, reduce pain and discomfort after surgery,&#xD;
      avoid major scars, provide a faster recovery and thus shorter hospital stay. Such minimally&#xD;
      invasive procedures in urinary tract surgeries are often performed as laparoscopic or robotic&#xD;
      surgeries where CO2 (carbon dioxide) is insufflated into the abdominal cavity to create a&#xD;
      working space for the surgeon's instruments. That high pressure created in the abdominal&#xD;
      cavity (pneumoperitoneum) to create a workspace for the surgeon start a series of&#xD;
      physiological changes in the heart, lung and kidney.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Today, most laparoscopic, and robotic operations are performed with pneumoperitoneum of&#xD;
      approximately 12-15 mm Hg, despite the fact that international guidelines recommend the use&#xD;
      of the lowest intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) possible allowing adequate exposure of the&#xD;
      operative field rather than using a routine pressure level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigator will conduct a randomized double-blind study involving 120 patients (2 groups of&#xD;
      60). The first group will be operated with standard pressure in the abdominal cavity 12-15 mm&#xD;
      Hg (high IAP), patients in the second group will be operated on with a reduced pressure of â‰ˆ&#xD;
      7 mmHg (low IAP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigator would like to assess the practical feasibility of operating under low IAP.&#xD;
      Quality of recovery of patients in relation to both physical and mental status, and&#xD;
      post-operative use of pain killer will be also investigated using a validated questionnaire .&#xD;
      Finally, Invistigator will examine the impact of IAP on post-operative renal function, and&#xD;
      risk of kidney injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis is carrying out laparoscopic/robotic surgeries under low IAP can optimize the&#xD;
      post-operative quality of recovery, decrease pain and use of pain killer, improve&#xD;
      post-operative renal function, and decrease risk for kidney injury. On the other hand low IAP&#xD;
      can risk overview for surgeon, make workspace smaller and raise risk of bleeding.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 120 patients between the ages of 18 and 80 years who were scheduled for elective&#xD;
      robotic radical nephrectomy will included in the study. This is randomized controlled&#xD;
      double-blind clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A standard anesthesia protocol will be used in both groups. Bladder catheter inserted by the&#xD;
      OP-nurse. After ports installment under IAP of 7 mm Hg, the surgeon leaves the operation&#xD;
      field and sits at a surgical console. The ground nurse opens the sealed letter which&#xD;
      indicated the pressure for operation (electronic randomization was previously performed by&#xD;
      investigator using https://www.graphpad.com/quickcalcs/index.cfm) The required IAP sets by&#xD;
      the ground nurse before the surgery started. Assistants are not blinded in the study, but the&#xD;
      surgeon is. Intra-abdominal pressure will be maintained at 7 mmHg in Group Low IAP and at 12&#xD;
      mmHg in Group High IAP throughout the surgery. If under operation the surgeon required to&#xD;
      raise the IAP because of bad views, or bleeding, he/she can always ask the ground nurse to&#xD;
      raise the pressure by 2- or 3-mm Hg at a time until surgeon obtain the preferred view. This&#xD;
      involved both groups. Patient will not be excluded from study if pressure increased, but the&#xD;
      duration of raised IAP will be registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the operation, the surgical working space will be evaluated by surgeon using an&#xD;
      adopted version of SRS (Surgical rating scale). 1st time during mobilization of bowel, 2nd&#xD;
      time during renal vascular dissection, and last time when surgeon remove the kidney and set&#xD;
      it in the Endobag.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients asked to register their 24-hour urine production before the operation day.&#xD;
      Intra-operative urine output will be also registered. 10 ml urine will be collected 3 times&#xD;
      in order to investigate the risk of Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) by kidney injury biomarker&#xD;
      (u-NGAL, og KIM-1). Pre-operatively during urinary catheter placement, 2-hour&#xD;
      post-operatively, and 24 hours after operation. Urine samples collected and stored in -80 C&#xD;
      for later analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigator will test the quality of recovery using a validated Quality of recovery-15&#xD;
      (QoR-15) questionnaire before the surgery and at day 1,3,14,30 post-op.&#xD;
