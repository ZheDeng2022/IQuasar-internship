  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is a very serious medical condition, classically categorized as a neurological&#xD;
      disorder that occurs due to obstructed blood flow to specific parts of the brain, and&#xD;
      resultant death of that area.This obstructed blood supply results in compromised function of&#xD;
      that part of the brain, resulting in paralysis or interference with the normal function of&#xD;
      the body controlled by that specific region of the brain. Stroke is usually of two types i.e.&#xD;
      Ischemic and hemorrhagic. Ischemic stroke results in reduced or complete obstruction in blood&#xD;
      flow in the vessels resulting in ischemia, while a hemorrhagic stroke occurs due to rupture&#xD;
      of blood carrying vessels and results in clotting. CIMT has proven effective in&#xD;
      rehabilitation of motor functions of lower limbs in many pieces of evidence but still, the&#xD;
      evidence is less as compared to the upper extremity. Evidence about improvement in balance&#xD;
      and gait using CIMT is very little. In some studies, hours of daily practice for the task has&#xD;
      used as a total therapeutic dose measurement. While, in other studies, repetitions of the&#xD;
      task have used to calculate the total amount of therapeutic intervention. This study will&#xD;
      evaluate the effects of frequency and duration of the task in CIMT on motor functions, gait &amp;&#xD;
      balance of lower limb stroke patients by intervention using these two protocols of CIMT.&#xD;

      Stroke is a very serious medical condition, classically categorized as a neurological&#xD;
      disorder that occurs due to obstructed blood flow to specific parts of the brain, and&#xD;
      resultant death of that area. This obstructed blood supply results in compromised function of&#xD;
      that part of the brain, resulting in paralysis or interference with the normal function of&#xD;
      the body controlled by that specific region of the brain. Stroke is usually of two types i.e.&#xD;
      Ischemic and hemorrhagic. Ischemic stroke results in reduced or complete obstruction in blood&#xD;
      flow in the vessels resulting in ischemia, while a hemorrhagic stroke occurs due to rupture&#xD;
      of blood carrying vessels and results in clotting. Both types reduce the supply of oxygen to&#xD;
      the parts of the brain and result in cognitive and physical disabilities. Most common&#xD;
      physical disabilities e.g. moving certain parts, swallowing, speaking, bowel bladder,&#xD;
      coordination &amp; balance. Other commonly occurring underlying disabilities range from&#xD;
      cognitive, emotional to behavioural issues. Constrained Induced Moment Therapy (CIMT) is a&#xD;
      therapeutic intervention involving the family of techniques, used most commonly to treat&#xD;
      physical disabilities in patients of stroke. These techniques involve restraint of the intact&#xD;
      or normal limb over an extended period, in combination with several movement repetitions of&#xD;
      task-specific training by the affected limb and lead to improved functional status. Frequency&#xD;
      and duration of tasks performed by affected limbs can affect outcomes effectively.&#xD;
      Physiologically brain has characteristics of plasticity, which is the basis for CIMT as a&#xD;
      treatment. The neurophysiological mechanism that is believed to be underline treatment&#xD;
      benefits of CIMT includes overcoming learned outcomes and plastic reorganization of the&#xD;
      brain. The brain changes itself when effected extremity is used intensively and repetitively.&#xD;
      The physiological effects of CIMT are explained as cortical reorganization, dendritic&#xD;
      branching, redundancy learned and synaptic strength Evidence on CIMT interventions for lower&#xD;
      limb was quite rare. But many pieces of research supported that CIMT can be used as an&#xD;
      equally effective intervention for a lower limb as it is being used for the upper limb.&#xD;
      Constraining the lower extremity was difficult and complex as compared to the upper&#xD;
      extremity. Improved functional status of the lower limb by treating with CIMT was accompanied&#xD;
      by less balance, coordination and short stepped gate. Some researchers focused on repetitions&#xD;
      while others focused on forced movements. All the evidence showed improved functional level&#xD;
      in the post-stroke lower limb.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stroke can be managed by a variety of different techniques, one of which is&#xD;
      constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT). This form of rehabilitation focuses on the&#xD;
      intensive use of the affected limb while restricting the use of the unaffected limb. The&#xD;
      types of restraints used include a splint, a sling, a glove, a mitt and a combination of a&#xD;
      sling and a resting hand splint. CIMT has been more commonly practised in the upper limb but&#xD;
      after positive results were obtained from the upper extremity protocol, a protocol was&#xD;
      developed for the lower extremity as well. A vast number of studies have shown the success of&#xD;
      CIMT in treating the reduction of upper limb use in the practical world after traumatic brain&#xD;
      injury, cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis and stroke. A specially adapted form of CIMT for&#xD;
      the lower limb has also been successful in treating deficits in the lower limb after spinal&#xD;
      cord injury and stroke&#xD;

    <description>Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) scale is an index to assess the sensorimotor impairment in individuals who have had a stroke. FMA scale has shown high validity and moderate to high reliability. Researches have shown stable responsiveness for this scale, lower extremity (maximum score of 34 points) are recommended as core measures to be used in every stroke recovery and rehabilitation trial.</description>

    <description>Tinetti Balance and Gate Test is a reliable and valid tool to measure gait ability in stroke patients. The Tinetti-gait and balance scale is a reliable and valid tool to measure gait ability in patients with chronic stroke. The inter-rater reliability of the Tinetti-gait scale is high.&#xD;
Scoring of the Tinetti Assessment Tool is done on a three point ordinal scale with a range of 0 to 2.&#xD;
A score of 0 represents the most impairment, while a score of 2 represents independence. The individual scores are then combined to form three measures; an overall gait assessment score, and overall balance assessment score, ad a combined gait and balance score</description>
