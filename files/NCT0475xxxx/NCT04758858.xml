  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently, there has been an increased interest in limiting carbohydrates (CHO) intakes for&#xD;
      improving long-term health. Low CHO (&lt;30% energy from CHO) and very low CHO high fat (VLCHF;&#xD;
      10% CHO, 75% Lipid) diets are being advocated among people living with diabetes given their&#xD;
      almost immediate favorable impact on post-prandial blood glucose levels and on hemoglobin A1c&#xD;
      that have been reported by users. Adoption of these diets are met with reluctance by&#xD;
      healthcare professionals due to the lack of information on their safety. Concerns include the&#xD;
      impact on hypoglycemia frequency and glucagon response to hypoglycemia, diabetic&#xD;
      ketoacidosis, lipid profile, liver function insulin dose adjustments when adopting them in&#xD;
      the context of type 1 diabetes (T1D). Through a series of interviews, people with diabetes&#xD;
      following a VLCHF reported that the lack of support from HCPs often leads to hiding the fact&#xD;
      that they have adopted a VLCHF diet. This is an important source of concern that can lead to&#xD;
      additional safety issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal is to fill an important knowledge gap about the effectiveness, benefits and risks of&#xD;
      low CHO and VLCHF diets for people with T1D. The primary objective is to compare the&#xD;
      percentage of TIR of adults with T1D following a low-CHO diet or a VLCHF diet versus a&#xD;
      control diet for 12 weeks. The secondary objectives are (1) to evaluate efficacy of glucagon&#xD;
      in correcting hypoglycemia in the context of restricted carbohydrates intakes; (2) to&#xD;
      evaluate changes in HbA1c at 12 weeks and glucose fluctuations and % of time in hypoglycemia&#xD;
      at 6 weeks and 12 weeks of control diet, low-CHO diet or VLCHF diet; (3) to compare key&#xD;
      cardiometabolic risk factors (body composition, blood lipids, blood pressure and liver&#xD;
      inflammatory markers and function) at 6 weeks and 12 weeks of control diet, low-CHO diet or&#xD;
      VLCHF diet; (4) to evaluate the effect of restrictive CHO diets (low-CHO and VLCHF) on the&#xD;
      composition of the intestinal microbiota (optional).&#xD;

    <description>Two weeks before the intervention phase, insulin dose optimization and revision of participants' knowledge on carbohydrates counting, hypo- and hyperglycemia prevention and treatment will be done with a nurse and a dietitian under a physician's supervision. Once to twice a week, participants will be contacted to review if glucose values are in target.</description>
