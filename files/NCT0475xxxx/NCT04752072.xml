  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Complex Post traumatic Stress Disorder (CPTSD) is now recognized as a separate trauma-based&#xD;
      psychological condition to PTSD. CPTSD is a broader diagnosis that includes the core PTSD&#xD;
      symptoms (re-experiencing in the here and now, avoidance, and sense of current threat) plus&#xD;
      an additional set of symptoms that are collectively referred to as 'disturbances in&#xD;
      self-organisation' (DSO). DSO symptoms capture pervasive psychological disturbances that are&#xD;
      associated with traumatic exposures and that are distributed across three clusters:&#xD;
      difficulties in affect regulation (AR), negative self-concept (NSC), and disturbances in&#xD;
      relationships (DR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no effective interventions for CPTSD. It is therefore of paramount important to&#xD;
      identify effective interventions to treat veterans with CPTSD. The present study will be one&#xD;
      of the first to investigate the effectiveness of a novel, modular intervention for CPTSD.&#xD;
      Enhanced Skills Training in Affective and Interpersonal Regulation (ESTAIR) is a&#xD;
      person-centered intervention that involves targeting the symptoms of CPTSD clusters&#xD;
      sequentially using concrete modules (i.e., specific number of sessions targeting specific&#xD;
      clusters of symptoms).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall aim of this study is to establish the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary&#xD;
      effects of ESTAIR in treating CPTSD. To achieve these aims, the investigators will conduct a&#xD;
      pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT), with a sample of 60 military veterans meeting the&#xD;
      diagnostic criteria for CPTSD, and with two treatment arms: ESTAIR vs. a treatment-as-usual&#xD;
      (TAU) condition.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline, end of treatment (week 25) and 3-months follow up (week 37)</time_frame>
    <description>The ITQ (Cloitre et al., 2018) is a validated questionnaire assessing PTSD and complex-PTSD (CPTSD). Six items represent the three clusters of PTSD (re-experiencing, avoidance and sense of threat), while another six items represent the three clusters reflecting disturbances in self-organisation (DSO) (AD: affective dysregulation; NSC: negative self-concept; and DR: disturbances in relationships. The remaining items assess functional impairment relating to symptoms of PTSD (3 items) and DSO (3 items). Items are scored using 5-point Likert scales ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely), indicating how much a symptom has affected them in the past month.&#xD;
A diagnosis of CPTSD required a diagnosis of PTSD (at least one symptom of each of its three clusters as well as functional impairment) in addition to endorsement of at least one symptom of each of the three DSO clusters plus functional impairment.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, end of treatment (week 25) and 3-months follow up (week 37)</time_frame>
    <description>The PHQ-15 (Korienke et al., 2002) is a 15-item questionnaire of somatisation disorder symptoms. Items are scored using 4-point Likert scales ranging from 0 (&quot;not bothered at all&quot;) to 3 (&quot;bothered a little&quot; or &quot;nearly every day&quot;), indicating how much they have been bothered by a symptom over the past two weeks. Total scores range from 0 to 30, with scores of of ≥5, ≥10, ≥15 representing mild, moderate and severe levels of somatization.</description>

    <measure>Outcome on the single item Friends and Family Test (FFT) at end of treatment.</measure>
    <time_frame>End of treatment (week 25)</time_frame>
    <description>The FFT is a single item assessing the acceptability of an intervention (i.e., ' How likely is it that you would recommend our service to your GP, family and friends if they needed similar care?'). The item is scores on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (&quot;extremely unlikely&quot;) to 5 (&quot;extremely likely&quot;. The FFT is standardly administered as an end-of-treatment measure at Combat Stress</description>

    <measure>Experience of potentially traumatic life events on the Life Events Checklist (LEC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The LEC (Gray et al., 2004) is a 17-item questionnaire assessing potentially traumatic events in the respondent's lifetime. The LEC assesses exposure to 16 events plus one item assessing any other extraordinary stressful event. Respondents report whether they 1) directly experienced, 2) witnessed, 3) learned about, 4) are not sure, or 5) does not apply to them.</description>

    <measure>Rates of adverse events at end of treatment and 3-months follow up</measure>
    <time_frame>End of treatment (week 25) and 3-months follow up (week 37)</time_frame>
    <description>Using a previously applied approach (adapted from Klingberg et al., 2012), we will define serious adverse events as (i) death by suicide; (ii) suicide attempt; (iii) suicidal crisis without attempt; (iv) severe symptom exacerbation (increase of 2 standard deviations or more on the patient or researcher-rated ITQ. Non-severe adverse events will be defined as a score of ≥3 (agree 'quite a lot' or 'a lot') on any relevant item (e.g., subjectively worsening mental state, heightened stigma, increased medication use, increased conflict) on the patient-rated Adverse Events Questionnaire (adapted from Hutton et al., 2015).&#xD;
Participants who withdraw from the study will also be asked to complete the Adverse Events Questionnaire (adapted from Hutton et al., 2015) to determine whether withdrawal is due to adverse events.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in symptoms of CPTSD on the International Trauma Questionnaire (ITQ) following each module in ESTAIR arm only</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 7, Week 13, Week 19, Week 25</time_frame>
    <description>The ITQ (Cloitre et al., 2018) is described above as the primary outcome measure. Six items represent the three clusters of PTSD. Another six items represent the three clusters reflecting disturbances in self-organisation (DSO). The remaining items assess functional impairment relating to symptoms of PTSD (3 items) and DSO (3 items). Items are scored using 5-point Likert scales ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely), indicating how much a symptom has affected them in the past month.&#xD;
The ITQ will be completed following each module in the ESTAIR arm to gain insight into the progression of CPTSD symptoms during treatment and to support discontinuation of treatment should any adverse symptom exacerbation occur.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in symptoms of the moral injury on the 14-item Moral Injury Outcome Scale (MIOS) from baseline to 3-months follow-up</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3-months follow up (week 37)</time_frame>
    <description>The MIOS (Litz et al., 2020) is a 14-item questionnaire of moral injury. Items are scored using 5-point Likert scales ranging from 0 (strongly disagree) to 3 (strongly agree), indicating how much they would agree with each statement in the past month. Total scores range from 0 to 60, with higher scores indicating greater severity of moral injury.&#xD;
*Due to further validation work, the MIOS has been amended from a 15-item measure to a 14-item measure of moral injury.</description>
  </other_outcome>

  <intervention>
    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Enhanced Skills Training in Affective and Interpersonal Regulation</intervention_name>
    <description>The first (formulation) session enables linking present difficulties and traumatic events, identifying current issues/concerns, and collaboratively agreeing on the order of modules based on symptom severity and client readiness.&#xD;
The PTSD module provides narrative exposure to the traumatic memories and targets re-experiencing, avoidance and hyperarousal symptoms. The AD module focuses on identifying and labelling feelings, emotion management, distress tolerance, acceptance of feelings and experiencing positive emotions. The NSC module focuses on staying in the present moment and combating dissociation; self-compassion and mindfulness skills; challenging thinking patterns and developing a balanced view of self. The DR module focuses on exploring and revising maladaptive schemas; effective assertiveness; awareness of social context; and flexibility in interpersonal expectations and behaviours displayed in social interactions.</description>
