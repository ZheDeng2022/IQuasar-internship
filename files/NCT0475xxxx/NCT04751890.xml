  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A recent position paper calls for effective home-based exercise program for patients with&#xD;
      peripheral artery disease (PAD) and claudication to be implemented in real-world care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized-controlled trial aims to test the effects on mobility, hemodynamics and&#xD;
      cardiovascular outcomes of a structured home-based exercise program (SHB) compared to walking&#xD;
      advice (WA) recommendation intended as usual care, in PAD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Male and females PAD patients at Leriche-Fontaine's stage II and aged more than 60 years old&#xD;
      will be enrolled. Patients will be randomized in SHB or WA groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients of SHB group will receive a prescription of a home-based walking program during&#xD;
      serial testing sessions at the hospital. The program will include two 10-minute sessions/day&#xD;
      (6 days/week) of intermittent walking (1-minute work and 1-minute rest while seated) at a&#xD;
      prescribed speed converted into a walking cadence and followed at home using a metronome. Two&#xD;
      follow-up visits (at weeks 8 and 16) will be performed to evaluate patient adherence and to&#xD;
      update the exercise program by increasing the walking speed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomized in WA group will receive the advice to walk as suggested by the&#xD;
      guidelines. In particular, patients will be recommended to gather almost 30 minutes of&#xD;
      walking at least 3 times per week; when they will face claudication pain, they will be&#xD;
      allowed to rest and restart walking as soon as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures will be performed at the entry prior to randomization, at the end of&#xD;
      exercise programs (6-month) and after 12-month follow up. Primary outcomes will be the&#xD;
      pain-free walking distance and the 6-minute walking distance collected during the 6-minute&#xD;
      walking test Secondary outcomes will include ankle-brachial index, quality of life, lower&#xD;
      limb strength and long-term clinical outcomes including revascularization and mortality.&#xD;

    <measure>6-Minute Walking Test (mobility)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change at 6-month (end of training) respect to baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will be instructed to walk as far as possible on a 21m walkway in 6 minutes, with their habitual walking device, with the possibility to slow down and rest if necessary. The total distance walked, the pain-free walking distance, and the perceived exertion at the end of the test will be recorded.</description>

    <measure>Ankle Brachial Index (hemodynamics)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change at 6-month (end of training) respect to baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The ankle-brachial index (ABI) is the ratio of the blood pressure at the ankle to the blood pressure in the upper arm (brachium). The ABI is calculated by dividing the systolic blood pressure measured at the ankle for both limbs with the patient in supine position by the systolic blood pressure in the arm.</description>

    <measure>Vascu-QoL-6 (health-related quality of life)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change at 6-month (end of training) respect to baseline</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire consists of 6 items with a score ranging from 1 to 4 examining various aspects of disease-related quality of life. Higher scores correspond to better quality of life.</description>

    <measure>5-time sit-to-stand test (lower limbs strength)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change at 6-month (end of training) respect to baseline</time_frame>
    <description>This test consists in moving from a sitting position to a standing position on a 42- cm high chair as quick as possible, for five times, with arms folded across the chest. Time will be taken when the test starts, and when the patient lay his/her buttocks on the chair for the fifth time.</description>

    <description>Program will include two 10-minute sessions/day (6 days/week) of intermittent walking (1-minute work and 1-minute rest while seated) at a prescribed speed converted into a walking cadence and followed at home using a metronome. The walking sessions will be preferably performed indoors at home or on a treadmill. During the study, 2 follow-up visits (at weeks 8 and 16) will be performed to evaluate patient adherence to the program and to update the exercise program with the duration of each session that remained constant. The walking intensity of each exercise regime will be progressively modified to increase the training load. The patients will be asked to fill out a daily training record indicating completion of the exercise and any associated symptoms. Patients will have the ability to contact the rehabilitation team, composed of a physician and a sports science expert, throughout the entire study period via phone.</description>
