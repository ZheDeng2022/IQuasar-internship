      Investigators plan to recruit 50 PAH patients from UofL PAH Clinic, with various degrees of&#xD;
      severity (25 intermediate risk patients and 20 high risk patients) and 10 age and gender&#xD;
      matched controls. PAH patients are evaluated at least every 6 months by the PAH Clinic and&#xD;
      blood/urine samples will be obtained at each office visit. Blood, plasma and urine samples&#xD;
      will be used to measure 31 metal levels including heavy metals (cadmium, arsenic, cobalt,&#xD;
      lead etc.) and essential metals (calcium, copper, iron, zinc, potassium etc.) by the with&#xD;
      ICP-MS via the service of ITEMFC. Interactions among the 31 metals in PAH patients, metal&#xD;
      concentration differences between intermediate risk PAH, high risk PAH and control groups,&#xD;
      the correlation between metal concentrations and the etiology, severity, duration, treatment,&#xD;
      and progression of PAH/RV dysfunction over 12 months will be analyzed by CIEHS Biostatistics&#xD;
      and Informatics Facility Core.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Exposures to heavy metals such arsenic, lead, cadmium have been linked to increased incidence&#xD;
      of cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, current studies suffer from multiple drawbacks,&#xD;
      most studies were cross sectional in design, focused on individual metals without&#xD;
      consideration of the joint effects of multiple metals, and did not examine the possible&#xD;
      effects of essential metals in CVD. Especially, the relationship between heavy&#xD;
      metals/essential metal dyshomeostasis and right ventricular (RV) dysfunction/pulmonary&#xD;
      hypertension (PAH), is less investigated. Investigators hypothesize that increased toxic&#xD;
      heavy metals and/or essential metal dyshomeostasis impact hypoxia response, endothelial&#xD;
      dysfunction, perivascular inflammation and vascular remodeling of the pulmonary vasculature,&#xD;
      and are important pathogenic initiators/stimulators during the progression of PAH and&#xD;
      associated RV remodeling/dysfunction.&#xD;

      Investigators plan to recruit 50 PAH patients from UofL PAH Clinic, with various degrees of&#xD;

      matched controls. PAH patients are evaluated at least every 6 months by the PAH Clinic and&#xD;
      blood/urine samples will be obtained at each office visit. Blood, plasma and urine samples&#xD;

      and Informatics Facility Core.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heavy metals have the potential of generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative&#xD;
      stress whenever the release of ROS exceeds endogenous antioxidant capacity. Therefore,&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that heavy metal/essential metal dyshomeostasis could induce&#xD;
      oxidative stress responses, activate two key pulmonary vasculature regulators (endothelin 1&#xD;
      and hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) pathways), and in turn contributes to the PAH pathogenesis&#xD;
      and RV dysfunction. Oxidative stress, endothelin 1 and HIF pathway markers in the blood will&#xD;
      be measured with ELISA kits in both PAH and control groups. Investigators will perform&#xD;
      comprehensive correlation analysis between metal levels, oxidative stress markers, endothelin&#xD;
      1 and HIF pathway markers, and quantitative clinical biomarkers such as hemodynamic,&#xD;
      laboratory and functional data in PAH patients. Furthermore, investigators will perform&#xD;
      correlation analysis between blood levels of oxidative stress, endothelin 1 and HIF pathway&#xD;
      markers and the patients' dietary intake of antioxidant vegetables.&#xD;
