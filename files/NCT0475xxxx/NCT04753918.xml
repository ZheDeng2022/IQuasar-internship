  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is being conducted to assess the safety and feasibility of using a newly&#xD;
      developed bronchoscopic light delivery method of photodynamic therapy to treat subjects with&#xD;
      solid tumors in peripheral lung, who are inoperable or refused surgery.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer accounts for almost one-third of cancer deaths. Cancer screening strategies have&#xD;
      the potential to achieve a 20% reduction in death rates. Newly developed bronchoscopic&#xD;
      technologies (such as navigational bronchoscopy in a hybrid operation room) have been shown&#xD;
      to enable physicians to safely reach lesions in peripheral regions of the lung and obtain a&#xD;
      diagnosis. This new technology may now potentially offer bronchoscopic therapeutic&#xD;
      interventions, such as photodynamic therapy, to tumors that were previously unreachable due&#xD;
      to their peripheral anatomic location.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Photodynamic therapy (PDT) uses a combination of a photosensitizing drug (a drug that is&#xD;
      activated by light), called porfimer sodium (Photofrin®), and a light from a laser that emits&#xD;
      no heat. This technique works to allow the medical doctor to specifically target and destroy&#xD;
      abnormal or cancer cells while limiting damage to surrounding healthy tissue. The activation&#xD;
      of the drug is done by lighting the abnormal area using a fiber-optic device (very fine fiber&#xD;
      [like a fishing line] that permits light transmission) inserted into a flexible tube called a&#xD;
      bronchoscope. The light activates the porfimer sodium, which is concentrated in the abnormal&#xD;
      tissue, leading to its destruction. But the penetrating depth of light is about 1.5 to 2 cm&#xD;
      limits the treatment range of tumor size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We proposed a novel light delivery method of instilling a high-refractive-index (RI) liquid&#xD;
      (Lipiodol) to enhance light delivery in the lung.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine if physicians can reach the tumors in the periphery&#xD;
      of the lung via electro-navigational bronchoscopy in a hybrid operation room and inject the&#xD;
      lipiodol to cover the whole tumor then deliver photodynamic therapy by placing the optical&#xD;
      fiber into the tumor&#xD;
