  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current standard of care for limiting the movement of mechanically ventilated critical&#xD;
      care patients is the use of physical wrist restraints, which are both ineffective in&#xD;
      preventing removal of invasive and adjunct respiratory support devices and have a multitude&#xD;
      of negative physical and psychological consequences for the patient. The objective of the&#xD;
      proposed research is to test an innovative device designed to allow more freedom of movement&#xD;
      of mechanically ventilated patients without bending of the arms, thereby preventing removal&#xD;
      of adjunct mechanical ventilation devices and invasive monitoring equipment.&#xD;
