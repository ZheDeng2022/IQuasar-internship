  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is very common functional gastrointestinal disorder in daily&#xD;
      gastrointestinal practice. Its etiology is multifactorial and incompletely understood.&#xD;
      Different types of treatment have been trying but no single drug is effective for every&#xD;
      patients. After the discovery of 5HT4(5 hydroxytryptamine-4) receptor and its effect on&#xD;
      gastrointestinal motility, 5HT4 receptor agonist becoming a good therapeutic tool in&#xD;
      different functional gastrointestinal disorder. Prucalopride is a selective 5HT4 agonist and&#xD;
      it has proven benefit in chronic idiopathic constipation but there is not enough evidence&#xD;
      that it is effective in constipation predominant IBS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To assess the efficacy of Prucalopride in constipation predominant IBS patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material &amp; method: Consecutive patients of both sexes, age more than 18 years attended the&#xD;
      outpatient department of Gastroenterology meeting the inclusion Criteria of IBS-C will be&#xD;
      initially enrolled for the study. Their clinical history, examination &amp; initial&#xD;
      investigations report will be noted on the standard data sheet. Any alternative diagnosis if&#xD;
      proven by clinical examination or laboratory investigation will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
      Randomization into two groups (Prucalopride and placebo) will be performed by lottery.&#xD;
      Patients will be randomly assigned to receive either Prucalopride 2 mg or placebo for 6&#xD;
      weeks. IBS symptoms will be assessed by IBS-SSS (symptom severity score) and IBS-QOL(quality&#xD;
      of life) at the baseline, 2nd week and 6th week of treatment (end of treatment). Any adverse&#xD;
      effect due to drugs will also be monitored by base line ECG, calculation of corrected QT&#xD;
      interval and ECG monitoring (2 weeks and 6 weeks) during the course of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis By SPSS. IBS-SSS and IBS-QOL instrument scores will be expressed as mean Â±&#xD;
      standard deviation. Statistical analysis will be done by paired and unpaired 't' test. P&#xD;
      value &lt;0.05 will be considered statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Consideration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every ethical issue will be discussed with the patient regarding the study and informed&#xD;
      written consent will be obtained. There will be no chance of disclosure of information that&#xD;
      will have been harmful to the patients or others. Permission have been taken from the&#xD;
      concerned departmental ethical committee as well as ethical review committee of BSMMU in&#xD;
      order to carry out the study.&#xD;

      Consecutive patients of both sexes, age more than 18 years attended the outpatient department&#xD;
      of Gastroenterology meeting the inclusion Criteria of IBS-C will be initially enrolled for&#xD;
      the study. Their clinical history, examination &amp; initial investigations with Complete Blood&#xD;
      Count , C-Reactive Protein, Tissue Transglutaminase antibody, Oral Glucose Tolerance Test,&#xD;
      Thyroid Stimulating Hormone will be done from respected department of BSMMU. Report will be&#xD;
      noted in the standard data sheet. Any alternative diagnosis if proven by clinical examination&#xD;
      or laboratory investigation will be excluded from the study. All participants will be advised&#xD;
      to maintain their usual dietary practices throughout the study. The subject will be recruited&#xD;
      according to sample size. Total study population will be divided in to Prucalopride and&#xD;
      placebo group. An independent treatment code will be generated and allocated according to&#xD;
      sample size in each group. Randomization into two groups will be performed by lottery. The&#xD;
      independent treatment codes and allocation will be maintained, which will be locked until all&#xD;
      analyses will have been completed. Thus, the clinical trial will be performed double-blind&#xD;
      with all patients and investigators will unaware of which treatment is allocated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One group will receive tab Prucalopride 2 mg once daily 30 minute before breakfast, while the&#xD;
      other group will receive identical looking placebo one tab once daily at same time. The&#xD;
      tablets will be administered for a total of 6 weeks. Before starting treatment each&#xD;
      individual will undergo a baseline assessment during which demographic data, base line&#xD;
      investigations, IBS symptoms by IBS-SSS and QOL data will be recorded. Patients will be&#xD;
      followed-up at 2 weeks, then at 6 weeks by IBS-SSS questionnaire and IBS-QOL questionnaire.&#xD;
      Patients will be asked to return with the strips of the ingested drugs at the end of the&#xD;
      treatment to count &amp; ensure compliance. Any adverse effect due to drugs will also be&#xD;
      monitored by base line ECG, calculation of corrected QT interval and ECG monitoring (2 weeks&#xD;
      and 6 weeks) during the course of treatment. Any adverse event will be responded quickly and&#xD;
      documented at the same time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IBS-SSS is a 5 item tools. It is primarily a measure of IBS symptoms including abdominal pain&#xD;
      and distension as well as bowel satisfaction. This scale evaluates IBS symptoms: abdominal&#xD;
      pain, abdominal distension, stool frequency and consistency and interference with life in&#xD;
      general. The IBS-SSS calculates the sum of these 5 items scored on a visual analogue scale&#xD;
      from 0-100. Determination of severity of each symptom is determined by the patient. The&#xD;
      nature of the items on IBS-SSS is appropriate to be used in clinical trials. The items are&#xD;
      summed and thus the total score can range from 0 to 500 points. IBS severity has the&#xD;
      following defined ranges: mild 75-174, moderate 175-300, and severe &gt; 300.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IBS-QOL questionnaire is a 34-item instruments which assess QOL impairment due to IBS&#xD;
      symptoms. Each item is scored on a five-point scale (1 = not at all, 5 = extremely) that&#xD;
      represents one of eight dimensions (dysphoria, interference with activity, body image,&#xD;
      health-related worries, food avoidance, social reactions, sexual dysfunction, and&#xD;
      relationships). After scoring by the patient, responses will be transformed to reverse code&#xD;
      system (5= not at all, 1= extremely). Items are scored to derive an overall total score of&#xD;
      IBS related QOL. To facilitate score interpretation, the summed total score is transformed to&#xD;
      a 0-100 scale ranging from zero (poor QOL) to 100 (maximum QOL). The QOL instrument will be&#xD;
      given to each patient before treatment is started. The patient will complete the form&#xD;
      according to schedule and all data will be recorded and entered onto a data sheet.&#xD;
