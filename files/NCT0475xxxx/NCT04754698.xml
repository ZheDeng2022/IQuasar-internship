  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with chronic rheumatic diseases (such as systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE],&#xD;
      rheumatoid arthritis [RA], ankylosing spondylitis [AS], juvenile idiopathic arthritis [JIA],&#xD;
      poly/dermatomyositis [PM/DM], systemic sclerosis [SSc], systemic vasculitis, and primary&#xD;
      Sjögren's syndrome [pSS]) are particularly susceptible to infectious diseases due to&#xD;
      autoimmune disorder itself and its treatment (immunosuppressive therapies). Similarly, people&#xD;
      living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) are predisposed to infections by different agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current 2019 Coronavirus Disease Pandemic-19 (COVID-19), caused by the SARS-CoV-2 (severe&#xD;
      acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) began in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and quickly&#xD;
      became a global health and economic emergency by taking to an unprecedented burden on health&#xD;
      systems around the world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, SARS-Cov-2 infection raised particular concern in patients with autoimmune rheumatic&#xD;
      diseases (DRAI) since, due to chronic inflammatory immune dysregulation and the regular use&#xD;
      of immunosuppressive drugs, these patients are considered to be at high risk of contracting&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 and potentially evolving to a worse prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overlap between the COVID-19 pandemic and the HIV/AIDS pandemic also poses an additional&#xD;
      challenge, as the impact of co-infection is not yet fully known. The response to vaccines for&#xD;
      other agents, however, has already been described as compromised in PLWHA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vaccination is the most effective preventive measure to control the spread of coronavirus and&#xD;
      to reduce associated complications. Usually, live or attenuated vaccines are not recommended&#xD;
      for patients with chronic rheumatic diseases using immunosuppressants. However, immunization&#xD;
      with inactivated agents is strongly indicated, resulting, in general, in good immunogenicity&#xD;
      and adequate vaccine safety, as well as without relevant deleterious effects on diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vaccine efficacy studies are needed to verify the immunogenicity of the vaccine against&#xD;
      COVID-19 in immunosuppressed patients with rheumatological disease and those with HIV-related&#xD;
      disease considering the risk of greater severity. In addition, it is important to assess the&#xD;
      safety of the vaccine in this population as well as the possibility of reactivating the&#xD;
      rheumatological disease itself.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study will evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the CoronaVac (Coronavirus&#xD;
      vaccine, Sinovac Biotech Ltd.) in patients with rheumatic diseases and PLWHA&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A sample of 1254 patients with rheumatic diseases and 542 healthy controls matched for age&#xD;
      and sex was calculated as follows.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.A) Evaluation of patients with SLE compared to a healthy control group matched for age and&#xD;
      sex. The investigators calculated 74 patients in each arm, which will be compared&#xD;
      independently to the healthy control group:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  74 SLE patients treated with hydroxychloroquine alone;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  74 SLE patients with mild immunosuppression (azathioprine or methotrexate and prednisone&#xD;
           &lt;10 mg/day);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  74 patients with moderate to severe immunosuppression (mycophenolate mofetil or&#xD;
           cyclophosphamide and/or prednisone &gt;10 mg/day);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  50 patients with belimumab (convenience sample). Total: 272 SLE patients and 74 healthy&#xD;
           controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.B) Evaluation of RA patients compared to healthy controls matched for age and sex. The&#xD;
           investigators calculated 61 patients in each arm, which will be independently compared&#xD;
           to the control group:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  61 RA patients only with conventional synthetic disease-modifying drugs (DMARDs);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  61 RA patients with biological disease-modifying drugs (bDMARDs) with anti-TNF&#xD;
           (anti-tumor necrosis factor) action;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  61 RA patients with bDMARDs with non-anti-TNF action and with impact on the production&#xD;
           of immunoglobulins (abatacept and rituximab);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  61 RA patients with bDMARDs with anti-IL-6 (anti-interleukin-6) action (tocilizumab) and&#xD;
           synthetic drugs with anti-JAK (anti-janus kinase) action (tofacitinib).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total: 244 RA patients vs. 61 healthy controls. 1.C) Evaluation of the interruption of the&#xD;
      use of methotrexate (MTX) for 4 weeks from the first dose of vaccination in RA patients.&#xD;
      Inclusion: patients using MTX in a stable dose for at least 4 weeks, prednisone maximum dose&#xD;
      of 7.5 mg/day, in association or not with other drugs, to be randomized in two arms: one that&#xD;
      keeps the therapy stable and the other which suspends MTX for 4 weeks from the first dose.&#xD;
      The investigators calculated 96 patients in each arm:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  96 MTX patients who will not have their therapy changed;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  96 MTX patients who will stop only MTX on the day of vaccination for 4 weekly&#xD;
           applications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total: 192 RA patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.D) Evaluation of patients with AS/psoriatic arthritis compared to a healthy control group&#xD;
      matched for age and sex. The investigators calculated 136 patients in each arm, 136 with&#xD;
      synthetic DMARDs and 136 with bDMARDs, to be compared with 136 healthy controls matched for&#xD;
      age and sex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total: 272 patients with AS/psoriatic arthritis vs. 136 healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. E) A convenience sample of 250 (50 in each group) patients with other rare rheumatic&#xD;
           diseases (SSc, PM/DM, pSS, systemic vasculitis, and primary antiphospholipid antibody&#xD;
           syndrome) being followed up in Rheumatology Division (HCFMUSP) will be vaccinated and&#xD;
           matched using the pool of controls from the other samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Controls: 271 healthy controls matched for age and sex will be included according to the&#xD;
           need for controls for SLE (n = 74), RA (n = 61) and AS/psoriatic arthritis (n = 136)&#xD;
           will be selected to receive the vaccine at HCFMUSP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) The investigators considered the immunogenicity of&#xD;
           the vaccine for Yellow Fever as a parameter in a previous study carried out by our&#xD;
           group. The response found was p1 = 92% induction of neutralizing antibodies in PLWHA.&#xD;
           Considering the 1:1 ratio between vaccinated and controls, alpha error of 5% with 80%&#xD;
           power, the sample size will be 271 vaccinated in the PLWHA group and 271 in the control&#xD;
           group, with an effect size of 0.25.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total population: 1254 ARD patients + 542 controls + 271 patients in PLWHA group = 2067&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to a symptom diary (provided to research subjects on the 1st and 2nd vaccine&#xD;
      doses), all patients and controls were instructed to contact the researchers by email,&#xD;
      WhatsApp, and telephone in case of adverse effects or symptoms of COVID. In cases of&#xD;
      suspected COVID, RT-PCR and genotyping are being performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extension phase of the project&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are clinical trials using a booster dose (third dose of mRNA vaccine against COVID-19)&#xD;
      in renal transplant recipients, who similarly to patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases&#xD;
      (ARDs), had high rates (about 40%) of poor humoral response. Antibody titers increased after&#xD;
      the third dose in one third of patients who had negative response and in all patients who had&#xD;
      low antibody titers. In addition, patients on therapy with specific drugs (tacrolimus,&#xD;
      mycophenolate and glucocorticoids) were less likely to develop anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies&#xD;
      than those treated with other regimes. No serious adverse events were observed after the&#xD;
      third dose (Werbel et al., 2021; Benotmane et al., 2021).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, we consider a booster dose (third dose of Sinovac-CoronaVac) for ARDs patients 6&#xD;
      months after the primary vaccination. The monitoring of anti-SARS-CoV-2 humoral response&#xD;
      [anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroconversion and neutralizing antibody (NAb)] will be carried out&#xD;
      immediately before the third dose and 6 weeks after.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This extension phase of the study was approved by the National Research Ethics Committee&#xD;
      (Comissão Nacional de Ética em Pesquisa) (4.951.263). Only participants (patients/controls)&#xD;
      who agree to participate in the extension phase of the study will be included according to&#xD;
      the signed updated informed consent form. The expected sample is 1300 patients and 340&#xD;
      controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Guidance on use of immunosuppressive medications during the vaccination period will be&#xD;
      according to the updated recommendations of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR)&#xD;
      (https://www.rheumatology.org/Portals/0/Files/COVID-19-Vaccine-Clinical-Guidance-RheumaticDis&#xD;
      easesSummary.pdf).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similar to the first phase of the study, in addition to a symptom diary (provided to research&#xD;
      subjects on the 3th vaccine doses), all patients and controls were instructed to contact the&#xD;
      researchers by email, WhatsApp, and telephone in case of adverse effects or symptoms of&#xD;
      COVID. In cases of suspected COVID, RT-PCR and genotyping are being performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an exploratory substudy nested within this phase 4 trial, a subsample composed by&#xD;
      AS/psoriatic arthritis (n=60) will be randomly assigned to receive exercise or nothing 1 hour&#xD;
      before vaccination, under the working hypothesis that exercise may boost immune responses to&#xD;
      the vaccine, wich would benefit immunocompromised patients. The exercise session will be&#xD;
      conducted by experienced exercise physiologists and will comprise a brief specific warm-up&#xD;
      and 3 unilateral resistance exercises (lateral raise, biceps curl and overhead extension) in&#xD;
      the left arm (the same arm used for vaccination). The exercises will be performed using&#xD;
      dumbbells, with eccentric and concentric contractions (4 sets of 8-12 repetition maximum).&#xD;
      Interval between exercises and sets will be 30 seconds. The total duration of the exercise&#xD;
      session will be approximately 20 minutes. Thirty minutes after the end of the exercise&#xD;
      session, patients will receive the vaccine in the same arm (i.e., left arm). Immediately, 24h&#xD;
      and 48h after the exercise session, local pain (muscle soreness) in the exercised arm will be&#xD;
      assessed by visual analogue scale (0 [no pain] to 100 [worst possible pain]).&#xD;
      Exercise-induced edema will be determined by circumference measures of the biceps.&#xD;
      Participants will also report self-perceived exertion after exercise using the Borg scale.&#xD;
      Blood sample to assess immunogenicity (primary outcome) will follow the same schedule&#xD;
      proposed in the phase 4 trial. Control group will receive no intervention and will follow the&#xD;
      vaccination scheme adopted in the phase 4 trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amendment to the extension phase of the project&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale: There are clinical trials comparing homologous vaccine scheme (two first doses)&#xD;
      against COVID-19 versus heterologous immunization suggesting that the latter was well&#xD;
      tolerated and improved immunogenicity healthy individuals (Hillus et al., 2021). In animal&#xD;
      models, there is evidence that application of a third vaccine dose (booster) with an mRNA&#xD;
      vaccine after two vaccine doses of inactivated against COVID-19 induce a relatively higher&#xD;
      level of neutralizing antibodies and T cell response (Zhang et al., 2021). Thus, we will&#xD;
      include the following extension analyses in this project:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. For patients and controls without humoral response (anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG and/or&#xD;
           neutralizing antibodies) after the 3rd dose of CoronaVac vaccine, a booster dose with&#xD;
           the available heterologous vaccine will be given as per the Plan National Vaccination of&#xD;
           COVID-19 in ARD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A new serology analysis will be performed (anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG and neutralizing&#xD;
           antibodies) 4-8 weeks after the heterologous vaccine booster. Immunogenicity will be&#xD;
           assessed through seroconversion rates of total IgG antibodies against S1 and S2 antigens&#xD;
           and neutralizing antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. In addition, the participants will be instructed to write down in a diary standardized&#xD;
           changes that occur and to contact investigators by e-mail or WhatsApp.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The updated recommendations of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) regarding to&#xD;
           the use of immunosuppressive medications during the vaccination period will be followed&#xD;
           (https://www.rheumatology.org/Portals/0/Files/COVID-19-Vaccine-Clinical-Guidance-Rheumat&#xD;
           icDiseasesSummary.pdf).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This amendment to the extension phase of the project was approved by the National Research&#xD;
      Ethics Committee (Comissão Nacional de Ética em Pesquisa) (5.014.175). Only participants&#xD;
      (patients/controls) who agree to participate in this amendment to extension phase of the&#xD;
      study will be included according to the signed updated informed consent form.&#xD;
