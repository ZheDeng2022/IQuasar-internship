  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sugar-sweetened beverage consumption is a major contributor to childhood obesity, caries,&#xD;
      fatty liver disease, and Type 2 diabetes. Latino children are more likely to consume&#xD;
      sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) and to suffer from all of the aforementioned conditions.&#xD;
      Reading out loud to children from birth through age 5 is critical for the promotion of&#xD;
      language and early literacy skills. Children whose parents read aloud to them are more likely&#xD;
      to start school with the skills required for early reading success. This is important as&#xD;
      reading proficiency in third grade is the best predictor of high school graduation and career&#xD;
      success. Latino children are less likely to be read to than non-Hispanic white children and&#xD;
      at higher risk of entering kindergarten without critical early literacy skills. Thus, there&#xD;
      is a pressing need for interventions to reduce SSB consumption among Latino children as well&#xD;
      as interventions that promote reading out loud. Primary care is an optimal setting for such&#xD;
      interventions. However, multiple demands on providers' time make it difficult to rely on&#xD;
      in-person interventions. For this reason, it is critical to test intervention designs that do&#xD;
      not rely directly on health care providers and that can be delivered remotely if needed. The&#xD;
      investigators have developed two m-health interventions for Latino parents, one that promotes&#xD;
      optimal beverage consumption patterns and one that promotes reading out loud to children. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to test the impact of these interventions on child beverage intake&#xD;
      patterns and the frequency with which parents read to children.&#xD;
