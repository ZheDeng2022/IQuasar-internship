  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain (PGP) can appear during pregnancy, directly&#xD;
      after labour or can be delayed to 3 weeks postpartum. Pain is experienced between the&#xD;
      posterior iliac crest and the gluteal fold, particularly in the vicinity of the sacroiliac&#xD;
      joint (SIJ). The pain may radiate in the posterior thigh and can also occur in conjunction&#xD;
      with/or separately in the symphysis. The endurance capacity for standing, walking, and&#xD;
      sitting is diminished. The diagnosis of PGP can be reached after exclusion of lumbar causes.&#xD;
      The pain or functional disturbances in relation to PGP must be reproducible by specific&#xD;
      clinical tests. Lack of accurate and early diagnosis of the PGP postpartum may contribute to&#xD;
      development of chronic condition, lowering quality of life years after delivery. There is&#xD;
      uncertainty regarding the association between the function of the pelvic floor muscles (PFM),&#xD;
      diastasis recti and postpartum pelvic girdle pain (PGP). Although widely researched abroad,&#xD;
      there is a paucity in research about biopsychosocial profile of women with postpartum PGP in&#xD;
      Poland.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The aim of this one-to-one matched case-control study it to examine whether there&#xD;
      is any difference in PFM function and diastasis recti between women with and without&#xD;
      clinically diagnosed PGP. Additionally, differences in biopsychosocial profile (depression,&#xD;
      anxiety, stress, catastrophizing and kinesiophobia) will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods: Because of low incidence of researched condition, a case control study&#xD;
      will be the study design of choice. Women 6-24 weeks after delivery with postpartum PGP will&#xD;
      be matched with those with no PGP. Subjects' assessment will consist of palpation examination&#xD;
      of diastasis recti (inter-recti distance) and pelvic floor muscles. Perineometry of the&#xD;
      pelvic floor will also be conducted. Additionally, several questionnaires for the assessment&#xD;
      of mental processing will be used: Depression Anxiety Stress Scale 21, Pain Catastrophizing&#xD;
      Scale and Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia. Participants will be matched according to age, parity&#xD;
      and time postpartum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results: To our knowledge, postpartum pelvic girdle pain has not been extensively&#xD;
      studied in Poland so far. The study will bring information about the possible associations&#xD;
      with postpartum PGP. We hypothesize that the study will confirm our clinical observations&#xD;
      about pelvic floor dysfunction and maladaptive mental processing in women with postpartum&#xD;
      PGP.&#xD;

    <description>Assesment of Catastrophizing. It consists of 13 items rated on 5- point scale (0-not at all, 4-all the time). The score range is 0-52. Higher scores indicates higher amounts of pain catastrophizing.</description>

    <description>Assesment of Catastrophizing. It is a self-report scale which consists of 21 items and 4-point severity scales (0- did not apply to me at all, 3-applied to me very much, or most of the time). Total scale thus range between 0 and 120, and those for each of the subscales may range between 0 and 42. Moderate outcomes indicates elevated depression, anxiety, or stress.</description>
