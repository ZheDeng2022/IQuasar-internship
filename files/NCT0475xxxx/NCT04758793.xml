  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cirrhosis is the 11th leading cause of death in the world. The progression to cirrhosis&#xD;
      occurs as a result of chronic hepatic injury, related to excessive alcohol consumption,&#xD;
      non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, chronic viral infection. Cirrhosis is accompanied by symptoms&#xD;
      that profoundly affect the quality of life of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sarcopenia, or decrease in muscle capacity through loss of muscle mass, is associated with&#xD;
      liver disease. Patients with liver disease and sarcopenia have increased morbidity, and&#xD;
      higher pre- and post-liver transplant mortality than patients without sarcopenia. The&#xD;
      mechanism responsible for the development of sarcopenia in liver disease remains largely&#xD;
      misunderstood, as do the mechanisms by which sarcopenia appears to promote complications of&#xD;
      liver disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study, carried out on a prospective cohort of patients with liver disease, aims at&#xD;
      understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in sarcopenia and its consequences.&#xD;

      misunderstood, as do the mechanisms by which sarcopenia appears to promote complications of&#xD;
      liver disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study, carried out on a prospective cohort of patients with stable liver disease, aims&#xD;
      at understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in sarcopenia and its&#xD;
      consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After checking the inclusion criteria, all eligible patients treated at Beaujon Hospital&#xD;
      (Clichy) will be invited to participate in the study. After inclusion, clinical and&#xD;
      laboratory features (hepatic assessment) will be collected and the blood samples will be&#xD;
      taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the surgery, a muscle biopsy will be performed on the incision area. No follow-up is&#xD;
      planned.&#xD;
