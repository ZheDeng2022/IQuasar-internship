      The Objective Visual Quality Analysis System (OQAS) is a new inspection technology used to&#xD;
      objectively assess the visual quality of the human eye. The investigators use this advanced&#xD;
      technology to evaluate and follow up cataract patients before and after surgery, and observe&#xD;
      the incidence, severity, and treatment effects of postoperative complications such as&#xD;
      postoperative complications, and analyze the severity and artificial The influence of lens&#xD;
      type, postoperative time, systemic diseases and other factors on the effect of cataract&#xD;
      surgery, in order to discover the key factors that affect the effect of cataract surgery and&#xD;
      the management of complications, and provide a useful reference for improving the level of&#xD;
      cataract prevention and treatment in China&#xD;

      The Objective Visual Quality Analysis System (OQAS) is a new inspection technology used to&#xD;
      objectively assess the visual quality of the human eye. It can detect the impact of ocular&#xD;
      refractive system diseases on the objective visual quality of patients. It is currently&#xD;
      mainly used to assess the progress of cataracts and help selection the timing of surgery has&#xD;
      achieved good clinical results. Before the emergence of OQAS, the rating of cataracts largely&#xD;
      relied on the subjective experience of physicians, and OQAS could accurately assess the&#xD;
      effects of cataracts on the visual quality of the human eye by quantitatively detecting the&#xD;
      light scattering index (OSI) of the refractive medium of the human eye. The impact provides a&#xD;
      quantitative evaluation basis for the diagnosis and treatment of cataract and research.&#xD;
      However, the application of OQAS in cataract surgery effect evaluation and postoperative&#xD;
      complications management is still lacking. After cataract surgery, although the cloudy lens&#xD;
      nucleus and cortex have been removed, the original refractive error, vitreous opacity,&#xD;
      postoperative posterior capsule folds, posterior dysfunction and many other factors may still&#xD;
      affect the objective of the human eye visual quality, and ordinary visual inspection is&#xD;
      difficult to find this effect . In addition, preoperative OSI and other indicators of&#xD;
      cataract, as an exposure factor, may affect the incidence of postoperative complications,&#xD;
      such as after-cataract, macular edema, etc. It is worthy of further study. The application of&#xD;
      OQAS can accurately assess the improvement of objective visual quality after cataract&#xD;
      surgery, and find and remove other factors that affect OSI. In addition, for one of the most&#xD;
      common complications after cataract surgery-after-onset disorder, there is no uniform rating&#xD;
      standard in the academic circles, and OQAS can provide objective data for the rating of&#xD;
      after-onset disorder, so as to provide information on the postoperative complications such as&#xD;
      late-onset disorder. Provide reference for the management of . The research team intends to&#xD;
      use OQAS to evaluate and follow up cataract patients before and after surgery, and observe&#xD;
      the incidence, severity, and treatment effects of postoperative complications such as&#xD;
      after-cataract, analyze the severity of cataract or after-cataract, and intraocular lens The&#xD;
      influence of factors such as type, postoperative time, systemic disease on the effect of&#xD;
      cataract surgery. We will also rate the posterior disorder based on OSI, and examine the&#xD;
      effects and risks of different grades of posterior disorder after laser capsulotomy and other&#xD;
      treatments, in order to use OQAS to better guide cataract surgery and postoperative&#xD;
      complications management.&#xD;
