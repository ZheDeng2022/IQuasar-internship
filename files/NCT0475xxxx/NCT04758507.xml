  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the sixth most common cancer in men and the eighth in women in&#xD;
      the USA. In Italy RCC incidence was 11500 new cases in 2017, while mortality was 3371 cases&#xD;
      in 2015. Increasing evidence suggests that response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), a&#xD;
      novel treatment for advanced RCC (aRCC) and other epithelial tumors, can be influenced by the&#xD;
      patient gut microbiota. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a novel therapeutic option&#xD;
      based on the restoration of healthy gut microbiota, and is the most effective therapy for&#xD;
      recurrent C. difficile infection, and preliminary nonrandomized findings show that FMT is&#xD;
      able to improve efficacy of ICIs in patients with advanced melanoma. The aim of this study is&#xD;
      to evaluate, through a randomized controlled trial, the efficacy of targeted FMT (from donors&#xD;
      who are responding to ICI. in improving response rates to ICIs in subjects with aRCC.&#xD;

      Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the sixth most common cancer in men and the eighth in women in&#xD;
      the USA. In Italy RCC incidence was 11500 new cases in 2017, while mortality was 3371 cases&#xD;
      in 2015. Increasing evidence suggests that response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), a&#xD;
      novel treatment for advanced RCC (aRCC) and other epithelial tumors, can be influenced by the&#xD;
      patient gut microbiota. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a novel therapeutic option&#xD;
      based on the restoration of healthy gut microbiota, and is the most effective therapy for&#xD;
      recurrent C. difficile infection, and preliminary nonrandomized findings show that FMT is&#xD;
      able to improve efficacy of ICIs in patients with advanced melanoma. The aim of the study is&#xD;
      to evaluate, through a randomized controlled trial, the efficacy of targeted FMT (from donors&#xD;
      who are responding to ICI) in improving response rates to ICIs in subjects with aRCC. So, the&#xD;
      investigators will investigate, through a randomized controlled trial, if donor FMT will be&#xD;
      more effective than placebo FMT in improving response to ICIs in patients with renal cell&#xD;
      carcinoma. Patients will undergo the first infusion by colonoscopy. Then, patients will&#xD;
      receive frozen fecal capsules (8 capsules t.i.d.) at 3 and 6 months after the first FMT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fifty patients will be enrolled. Sample size calculation was based on the hypothesis of the&#xD;
      superiority of FMT+SOC over SOC alone. The 1-year PFS rate for SOC has been reported to be&#xD;
      nearly 60%. The alternative hypothesis is that FMT can improve the 1-year PFS rate from 60%&#xD;
      to 80% wen associated to SOC. A total of 50 patients will enter this two-treatment&#xD;
      parallel-design study. The probability is 80 percent that the study will detect a treatment&#xD;
      difference at a one-sided 5.0 percent significance level, if the true hazard ratio is 0.436.&#xD;
      This is based on the assumption that the accrual period will be 18 months and the follow up&#xD;
      period will be 12 months and the median survival is 15.1 months. The total number of events&#xD;
      will be 35. Microbiome analysis will be performed with shotgun sequencing techniques.&#xD;
