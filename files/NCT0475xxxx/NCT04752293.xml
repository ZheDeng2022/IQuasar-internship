      Studying the causal roles of components of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system&#xD;
      (including angiotensin-(1-7) (Ang-(1-7)), angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), Ang II, and&#xD;
      ACE), uric acid, and klotho in pediatric hypertension and related target organ injury,&#xD;
      including in the heart, kidneys, vasculature, and brain. Recruiting children with a new&#xD;
      hypertension diagnosis over a 2-year period from the Hypertension Clinic at Brenner&#xD;
      Children's Hospital at Wake Forest Baptist Health, as well as healthy control participants&#xD;
      from local general primary care practices, and collecting blood and urine samples to analyze&#xD;
      components of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (Ang-(1-7), ACE2, Ang II, ACE), uric&#xD;
      acid, and klotho, and measuring blood pressure, heart structure and function, autonomic&#xD;
      function, vascular function, and kidney function at baseline, year 1, and year 2. Objectives&#xD;
      are to investigate phenotypic and treatment response variability and to causally infer if&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This longitudinal prospective cohort study is recruiting children and adolescents aged 7-18&#xD;
      years with newly diagnosed primary hypertension over a 2-year period from the Hypertension&#xD;
      Clinic at Brenner Children's Hospital, which sees over 300 new patients per year, who will be&#xD;
      treated with the first-line drug lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor, per standard of care&#xD;
      (Hypertension Cohort). Also recruiting healthy control participants aged 7-18 years with&#xD;
      normal blood pressure from local primary care practices (Control Cohort). Collecting blood&#xD;
      and urine to analyze Ang-(1-7), ACE2, Ang II, ACE, uric acid, and klotho and measuring&#xD;
      pediatric-specific outcomes (blood pressure (casual and ambulatory monitoring), indices of&#xD;
      heart structure and function on echocardiogram (left ventricular systolic and diastolic&#xD;
      function, left ventricular hypertrophy, etc.), kidney function (creatinine, estimated&#xD;
      glomerular filtration rate, albuminuria, proteinuria, urine sodium/potassium), autonomic&#xD;
      function (heart rate variability, blood pressure variability, baroreflex sensitivity), and&#xD;
      vascular function (arterial stiffness, augmentation index)) at baseline and year 1&#xD;
      (Hypertension Cohort and Control Cohort) and year 2 (Hypertension Cohort). The objectives are&#xD;
      to investigate if Ang-(1-7), ACE2, Ang II, and ACE identify phenotypic and treatment response&#xD;
      variability and to causally infer if Ang-(1-7), ACE2, Ang II, ACE, uric acid, and klotho&#xD;
      contribute to target organ injury, with these Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (1) Determine if plasma Ang-(1-7) or urine Ang-(1-7)/creatinine differ between the&#xD;
      Hypertension vs. Control Cohorts and (2) assess if plasma Ang-(1-7) or urine&#xD;
      Ang-(1-7)/creatinine mediate the effect of lisinopril-induced blood pressure reduction on the&#xD;
      outcomes (change in heart function and structure, autonomic function, vascular function, and&#xD;
      kidney function).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1a: Baseline Ang-(1-7) is lower in the Hypertension vs. Control Cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1b: Increased Ang-(1-7) levels over time mediate the effect of lisinopril-induced&#xD;
      decreased blood pressure on improved outcomes over 2 years in the Hypertension Cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (1) Evaluate if plasma Ang-(1-7) or urine Ang-(1-7)/creatinine predict treatment response in&#xD;
      participants in the Hypertension Cohort (change in casual blood pressure, ambulatory blood&#xD;
      pressure, heart function/structure, autonomic function, vascular function, and kidney&#xD;
      function); (2) compare to plasma renin activity and aldosterone; and (3) employ sensitivity&#xD;
      analyses to quantify the impact of unmeasured confounding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Lower baseline Ang-(1-7) predicts greater outcome improvements in the&#xD;
      Hypertension Cohort with lower unmeasured confounding and with greater predictive ability&#xD;
      compared to plasma renin activity and aldosterone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determine if plasma Ang-(1-7) or urine Ang-(1-7)/creatinine mediate the effects of uric acid&#xD;
      and klotho on the outcomes in participants in the Hypertension Cohort. (1) Apply causal&#xD;
      mediation to estimate if plasma Ang-(1-7) mediates the effects of uric acid on the outcomes&#xD;
      (change in casual blood pressure, ambulatory blood pressure, heart function/structure,&#xD;
      autonomic function, and vascular function). (2) Apply causal mediation to estimate if urine&#xD;
      Ang-(1-7)/creatinine mediates the effects of klotho on the outcomes (change in casual blood&#xD;
      pressure, ambulatory blood pressure, and kidney function).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3a: Lower plasma Ang-(1-7) mediates the effect of high uric acid on the outcomes&#xD;
      in the Hypertension Cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3b: Lower urine Ang-(1-7)/creatinine mediates the effect of low klotho on the&#xD;
      outcomes in the Hypertension Cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated results have great potential to impact patient care by establishing Ang-(1-7),&#xD;
      ACE2, Ang II, and ACE as biomarkers of treatment response, by establishing how Ang-(1-7) and&#xD;
      other components of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system change in response to an ACE&#xD;
      inhibitor, by indicating which patients would benefit most from ACE inhibitors, by&#xD;
      identifying novel etiologies of hypertension centered on alterations to the&#xD;
      renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, uric acid, and klotho, and by leading to novel&#xD;
      treatments. Indeed, these have been questions of great interest during the COVID-19 pandemic,&#xD;
      as ACE2 is the binding site for Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2. Ultimately,&#xD;
      the results from this study will improve patient outcomes by promoting cardiovascular health&#xD;
      and preventing cardiovascular disease across the lifecourse.&#xD;

        Hypertension Cohort: Participants will be recruited from among new patients referred to the&#xD;
        Hypertension Clinic at Brenner Children's Hospital. Patient population at this clinic,&#xD;
        which sees over 300 new patients/year, is 55% White, 25% Black, 16% Hispanic, and 62% male.&#xD;
        Goal is to enroll 100 participants over a 2-year period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Control Cohort: Participants for this cohort will be recruited from among healthy patients&#xD;
        seen at local pediatrics practices. Goal is to enroll 25 participants over a 2-year period,&#xD;
        frequency-matched to the Hypertension Cohort on age, self-identified race, and sex.&#xD;
