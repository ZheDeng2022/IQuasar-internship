      This study aims to determine the relevant 'ingredients' to make the best possible self (BPS)&#xD;
      intervention most efficacious and test whether the BPS's efficacy can be enhanced by&#xD;
      including mindfulness aspects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The best possible self (BPS) intervention is a brief positive psychology intervention to&#xD;
      increase a person's positive affect and optimism. The BPS has been used in different forms&#xD;
      (writing vs. imagining/visualizing vs. writing + imagining/visualizing the best possible&#xD;
      self). However, it remains unclear which 'ingredients' are necessary to let the BPS unfold&#xD;
      its effects. This online study aims to determine the relevant 'ingredients' to make the best&#xD;
      possible self (BPS) intervention most efficacious. Since mindfulness interventions have&#xD;
      recently indicated promising effects on positive and negative affect, another goal of this&#xD;
      study is to test whether the BPS's efficacy can be enhanced by including aspects of&#xD;
      mindfulness.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in emotional responses to imagery of neutral, pleasant and aversive narrative scripts</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from pre (baseline) to post scores (approx. 30 minutes later)]</time_frame>
    <description>Nine narrative imagery scripts are used. Scenes included three neutral, standard social threat and positive/reward events. All scripts were developed according to the recommendations of Lang (1979). Participants are asked to rate the vividness of imagery (1= not vivid at all, 9= very vivid), the wish to avoid imagery (1 = no wish to avoid , 9 = strong wish to avoid imagery), their experienced anxiety (1= no anxiety, 9=very strong anxiety), displeasure (1 = pleasant, 9 = unpleasant), and emotional arousal (1 = relaxed, 9 = aroused) during imagery on a 9-point rating scale. Emotional responses are averaged per category.</description>
