    <textblock>
      Early diagnosis of leukemia which is malignant tumor affecting bone especially in children is&#xD;
      import to allow early intervention improving prognosis. It is known that leukemic patients&#xD;
      suffer from clinical signs as anemia, thrombocytopenia, and pronounced hepatosplenomegaly or&#xD;
      lymphadenopathy. However, sometimes these clinical signs may be not clearly manifested and&#xD;
      may look like anemia. The early diagnosis could be achieved through dentist by accessing&#xD;
      clinical and radiographical signs such as oral masses, gingival bleeding /or enlargement and&#xD;
      oral ulceration with radiographical features including focal or generalized osteolysis of&#xD;
      bone with presence of moth eating appearance and even with abnormal teeth chronology&#xD;
      regarding teeth morphology, germ formation of permanent teeth and their sequence of eruption.&#xD;
      Therefore, accessing of these special clinical and radiographical features by the dentist&#xD;
      could help in early diagnosis of leukemic children patients&#xD;

      Ten children patients suffer from leukemia selected after initial diagnosis from hematology&#xD;
      unit of faculty of medicine, Tanta university based on their clinical signs such as; bone&#xD;
      pain, fatigability, lymph node enlargementâ€¦etc., with abnormal CBC revealing anemia or&#xD;
      abnormal WBCs. These patients accessed clinically for oral signs and accessed&#xD;
      radiographically using panoramic radiographs and cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) to&#xD;
      evaluate chronology and bone density.&#xD;
