    <textblock>
      The aim on this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of the anti-VEGFR2 monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody olinvacimab and the capecitabine in patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma&#xD;
      who failed two prior chemotherapies&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase lb/ll, multicenter, open label, single arm study to assess efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of the anti-VEGFR2 monoclonal antibody olinvacimab and capecitabine in patients with&#xD;
      metastatic colorectal cancer who failed two prior standard chemotherapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of phase lb is to determine maximal tolerated dose (MTD) and&#xD;
      recommended phase ll dose (RP2D) of olinvacimab in combination with capecitabine. the primary&#xD;
      objective of phase ll is to assess the efficacy of olinvacimab plus capecitabine as a salvage&#xD;
      regimen in metastatic colorectal carcinoma.&#xD;
