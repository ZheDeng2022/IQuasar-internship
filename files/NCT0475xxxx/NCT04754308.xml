      The trial investigates and describes the prevalence of COPD in patients who are in the social&#xD;
      nurses' target group and investigates the effect of opportunistic screening for COPD in these&#xD;
      vulnerable patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population is patients who have been referred to a social nurse at hospitals in the&#xD;
      Capital Region, Central Denmark Region and Region Zealand of Denmark during the inclusion&#xD;
      period, and monitor them for up to 5 years in order to investigate variables that are&#xD;
      significant in terms of the patients' treatment, hospitalisations, and mortality in relation&#xD;
      to COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that there will be a higher incidence of COPD among those patients with&#xD;
      whom the social nurses have contact than in the general population.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of two sub-studies: A a descriptive cross-sectional study &quot;The prevalence&#xD;
      of COPD in patients who are in the social nurses' target group&quot; followed by study B a cohort&#xD;
      study &quot;The effect of opportunistic screening for COPD in patients who are in the social&#xD;
      nurses' target group&quot;, based on a closed cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People in the lower social classes are at increased risk of developing COPD due to their&#xD;
      lifelong accumulation of risk factors, such as smoking, passive smoking and the influence of&#xD;
      lifestyle and the environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the group with the socially vulnerable individuals, 70% are smokers compared to 18% in the&#xD;
      general Danish population. The socially vulnerable individuals are defined here as people&#xD;
      affected by homelessness, drug abuse, harmful alcohol consumption, mental illness and&#xD;
      poverty. Despite the socially vulnerable group having an over-consumption of general practice&#xD;
      visits, 25% of the patients in the social nurses' target group state that they do not have&#xD;
      contact with or use their own doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is therefore that there will be a higher incidence of COPD among those&#xD;
      patients with whom the social nurses have contact than in the general population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: To investigate and describe the prevalence of COPD in patients who are in the social&#xD;
      nurses' target group and to investigate the effect of opportunistic screening for COPD in&#xD;
      these vulnerable citizens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline data from the cross-sectional study are derived from lung function measurement and&#xD;
      REDCap online-questionnaires completed on inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data from the cohort study regarding disease burden and hospital visits originates from&#xD;
      the national patient registry (LPR) and mortality data is retrieved from the Danish Register&#xD;
      of Causes of Death. Data regarding redeemed prescriptions for COPD medicine originates from&#xD;
      the Prescription Database. The patients' connection to the job market and income status are&#xD;
      based on extracts from RAS (Registry-based Labour Force Statistics), which is administered by&#xD;
      Statistics Denmark. Data regarding the highest acquired education (HFAUDD) is from Statistics&#xD;
      Denmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be collected the following variables at inclusion: information on demographics,&#xD;
      lung function, selv-reported information on: risk factors, socioeconomic variables and&#xD;
      symptoms of lung disease. Moreover register data on socioeconomic status, morbidity, physical&#xD;
      health by Charlson score, mortality, hospital visits and prescriptions for COPD Medicine will&#xD;
      be retrieved after 5 years follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To detect a difference between the patient group and the Danish population of minimum 100% a&#xD;
      total of 511 participants are needed in the study (power of 80%, p-values=0,05, an estimated&#xD;
      COPD prevalence of 4,3% in the Danish population).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The collected data will be kept in accordance to the Data Protection Agency guidelines. The&#xD;
      studies are carried out in accordance with the principles of the Helsinki Declaration.&#xD;

    <description>After obtaining informed consent, the social nurse reviews the online-questionnaire with the patient and performs a lung function examination requiring the patient to blow into a plastic tube. If a patient is identified as having obstructive reduction of lung function, they are offered a referral to a local pulmonary medicine department or GP for further investigation - regardless of whether or not they have a diagnosed or undiagnosed lung disease.&#xD;
In addition, participants are questioned about their motivation for smoking cessation and are informed of the options for this (in hospital and/or referral to the municipality).</description>

It is a routine examination and there are no risks, adverse reactions, or discomforts associated with the examination.</description>
