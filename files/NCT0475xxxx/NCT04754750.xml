    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia is a chronic and severe psychiatric disorder, these patients suffer from&#xD;
      positive symptoms, negative symptoms and cognitive deficits, of which working memory problems&#xD;
      are considered a central cognitive impairment. Atypical antipsychotics are believed to have a&#xD;
      superior effect in reducing both positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia, coupled&#xD;
      with a low risk of extrapyramidal symptoms. Particularly, 2nd-generation antipsychotic&#xD;
      medications are commonly used in treatment of schizophrenia. An antipsychotic drug,&#xD;
      Paliperidone palmitate (PDP), is administered to patients with schizophrenia as injections at&#xD;
      one-month (PP1M) or three-month (PP3M) intervals. This study was compare the effects of&#xD;
      treatment, social function, and side effects between PP1M and PP3M in patients with&#xD;
      schizophrenia. Moreover, the changes of cognitive and lipid profile between two PDP were also&#xD;
      explored. Firstly, participants were received the one month long-acting injection (PP1M)&#xD;
      three months. Then, the stable participants were shifted to the three month long-acting&#xD;
      injection (PP3M). Concomitant medications were allowed to prescribe except other&#xD;
      antipsychotics. Outcome measurements were 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20), 45-itme&#xD;
      quality of life for mental disorder (QOLMD), Short-version of the Udvalg for Kliniske&#xD;
      Undersogelser (short-version UKU), and Wisconsin Card Sorting test (WCST). These measurements&#xD;
      were performed every three-month except WCST which was performed every six-month. The&#xD;
      different effects of PP1M and PP3M will be expected to find out in this study.&#xD;

      This is a two and half-one years, single-arm, nonrandomized, open-label study which was&#xD;
      conducted between Jan 2015 to Jun 2017 including from a psychiatric center in southern&#xD;
      Taiwan. The stable schizophrenic patients who previously received risperidone long-acting&#xD;
      injection for more than one year and shifted to paliperidone palmitate after including in the&#xD;
      study. Firstly, participants were received the one month long-acting injection (PP1M) three&#xD;
      months. Then, the stable participants were shifted to the three month long-acting injection&#xD;
      (PP3M). Concomitant medications were allowed to prescribe except other antipsychotics.&#xD;
      Outcome measurements were 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20), 45-itme quality of life&#xD;
      for mental disorder (QOLMD), Short-version of the Udvalg for Kliniske Undersogelser&#xD;
      (short-version UKU), and Wisconsin Card Sorting test (WCST). These measurements were&#xD;
      performed every three-month except WCST which was performed every six-month. The effect of&#xD;
      treatment was assessed using Personal and Social Performance (PSP) scales for the evaluation&#xD;
      of psychosocial functioning at 0, 4, 8, and 12 weeks in first study, and at 0, 3, 6, 9, 12&#xD;
      months in second study, respectively. In addition, all participants were assessed for body&#xD;
      weight, waist circumference, and blood lipid profile. To evaluate the lipid profiles, fasting&#xD;
      blood samples were analyzed for total cholesterol (TC), Triglyceride (TG), High-density&#xD;
      Lipoprotein (HDL) and Low-density Lipoprotein (LDL). These blood samples were collected at&#xD;
      every month until study completion.&#xD;
