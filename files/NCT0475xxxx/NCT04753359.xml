      A Mediterranean Diet (MedDiet), a largely plant-based dietary pattern, is relevant to CRC&#xD;
      prevention and microbial production of anti-cancer metabolites in observational studies. A&#xD;
      MedDiet can shift BA metabolism as shown in primates and when combined with calorie&#xD;
      restriction, shows superior adherence and weight control in humans, given its palatability.&#xD;
      To date, no studies have tested in an RCT the effects of a MedDiet alone (MedA), WL through&#xD;
      lifestyle intervention (WL-A) or a calorie-restricted MedDiet for WL (WL-Med) on the BA-gut&#xD;
      microbiome axis and its relevance to CRC prevention among AAs. A multidisciplinary team&#xD;
      combining expertise in psychology, nutrition, microbiology, molecular cell biology,&#xD;
      computational biology, medicine and biostatistics, propose to conduct a four-arm RCT in which&#xD;
      200 obese AAs, 45-75 years old complete one of the following 8-month interventions: Med-A,&#xD;
      weight stable; WL-A, calorie restriction with no diet pattern change; WLMed; or Control. The&#xD;
      investigators will use samples and data collected at baseline, mid-study (month-4) and&#xD;
      post-intervention to compare the effects of the interventions on 1) Concentration and&#xD;
      composition of circulating and fecal BAs; 2) Gut microbiota and metabolic function; and 3)&#xD;
      Gene expression profiles of exfoliated intestinal epithelial cells.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) is associated with multiple risk factors including, obesity, low&#xD;
      fiber diets, and diets high in animal protein and saturated fat (SFat). African Americans&#xD;
      (AAs) have a higher prevalence of these risk factors and they have the highest incidence of&#xD;
      CRC and related mortality. These multiple risk factors are also linked to higher circulating&#xD;
      and fecal bile acids (BA) and a shift in BA amino acid conjugation from glycine to taurine.&#xD;
      These BA-related changes can alter the composition, structure, and metabolic activity of the&#xD;
      gut microbiota, fostering conditions for gut bacteria to expand and metabolize&#xD;
      taurine-conjugated BAs to genotoxic hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and the tumor promoter,&#xD;
      deoxycholic acid (DCA); a colonic milieu conducive to the formation of CRC. The investigators&#xD;
      have shown that the abundance of H2S-producing bacteria is significantly higher in the colon&#xD;
      of AAs compared to non-Hispanic whites (NHWs) and is a defining feature among AA CRC cases&#xD;
      implicating these bacteria as contributors to CRC development in a race-dependent manner.&#xD;
      Moreover, the microbial difference is associated with higher intake of SFat and animal&#xD;
      protein in AAs, providing a pivotal intervention target. The investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      targeting the BA-gut microbiome axis to suppress abundance, growth and metabolic activity of&#xD;
      H2S and DCA producing bacteria through diet and weight loss (WL) may reduce CRC risk,&#xD;
      especially among AAs. A Mediterranean Diet (MedDiet), a largely plant-based dietary pattern,&#xD;
      is relevant to CRC prevention and microbial production of anti-cancer metabolites in&#xD;
      observational studies. A MedDiet can shift BA metabolism as shown in primates and when&#xD;
      combined with calorie restriction, shows superior adherence and weight control in humans,&#xD;
      given its palatability. To date, no studies have tested in an RCT the effects of a MedDiet&#xD;
      alone (MedA), WL through lifestyle intervention (WL-A) or a calorie-restricted MedDiet for WL&#xD;
      (WL-Med) on the BA-gut microbiome axis and its relevance to CRC prevention among AAs. Our&#xD;
      multidisciplinary team combining expertise in psychology, nutrition, microbiology, molecular&#xD;
      cell biology, computational biology, medicine and biostatistics, propose to conduct a&#xD;
      four-arm RCT in which 200 obese AAs, 45-75 years old complete one of the following 8-month&#xD;
      interventions: Med-A, weight stable; WL-A, calorie restriction with no diet pattern change;&#xD;
      WLMed; or Control. The investigators will use samples and data collected at baseline,&#xD;
      mid-study (month-4) and post-intervention to compare the effects of the interventions on 1)&#xD;
      Concentration and composition of circulating and fecal BAs; 2) Gut microbiota and metabolic&#xD;
      function; and 3) Gene expression profiles of exfoliated intestinal epithelial cells. The&#xD;
      investigators approach is strong given the multidisciplinary team, use of evidence-based&#xD;
      lifestyle interventions, and sophisticated -omics analyses to examine crosstalk between&#xD;
      diet/WL, gut microbiome, and host intestinal physiology. If successful, this study could have&#xD;
      profound public health impact on CRC risk among AAs and other high-risk populations, that&#xD;
      would translate into timely dissemination opportunities.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This study is a four-arm RCT designed to test the effect of a weight-stable MedDiet alone (Med-A) lifestyle intervention, calorie restriction for WL with no diet composition change (WL-A) intervention, a MedDiet WL lifestyle intervention (WL-Med) compared to Control on BA metabolism, the gut microbiome, and gene expression in exfoliated intestinal epithelial cells. The study includes 1) screening potential subjects; 2) baseline assessment of diet, lifestyle behaviors (e.g., physical activity), anthropometrics, and blood and fecal sampling; 3) a four-arm RCT; and 4) mid-(month 4) and post-intervention (month 8) assessments.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>From stool preserved in Ambion Denaturation Solution, eukaryotic polyA+ RNA will be isolated using the Active Motif mTRAP Maxi kit followed by DNA removal with DNAFree (Invitrogen). Libraries will be quantified using the Library Quantification kit (Kapa Biosystems), and sequencing will be performed on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform using standard Illumina protocols. RNA reads will be mapped with the STAR aligner using the default parameters to the Ensembl GRCh38 human reference. Reads will be examined for quality control using FastQC and quantified using HTSeq-count. Sequencing reads will be filtered to remove genes present in low abundance. For stool exfoliated cells, the RNA-seq gene count matrix is very sparse, with most entries corresponding to zero transcripts; thus, genes in stool will be removed if &gt;33% of the samples contain only 0 or 1 read.</description>

For subjects randomized to WL-A, the focus will be on daily calorie restriction (-500-750 kcal/day) to achieve a 1-2 lb. per week WL and 5% WL from baseline at 8 months in the context of the subject's typical diet pattern. We will not ask subjects to abstain from alcohol during the trial despite its known effects on BA metabolism, but we will recommend that only 5% of calories come from alcohol taken with meals. Following the initial in-person session, subjects will meet for 26 group sessions (1-hour, held approximately weekly) over the remaining 7.5 months.&#xD;
The WL-A group will be prescribed an activity program with an initial recommendation of 100 min/week progressing to 150 min/week within 6 weeks. Subjects will also participate in 30 minutes of supervised physical activity during the group sessions</description>

No dietary recommendations are provided, and they will receive weekly health newsletters that include non-diet related health topics (e.g., flu prevention). Contact will be made again at month-4 and post-intervention (month-8) research visits and during monthly phone calls to collect data pertaining to recent diet intake. At the month-4 assessment, weight will be checked and those with &gt;2.5% WL from baseline will receive additional instruction from the RD to maintain lifestyle patterns.
