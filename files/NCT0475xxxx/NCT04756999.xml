    <textblock>
      Reflexology is massage therapy used to maintain and improve health, as well as relieve some&#xD;
      symptoms. Foot reflexology, which is thought to have an effect on dialysis symptoms, will be&#xD;
      applied to hemodialysis patients in 9 sessions. In this study, it is aimed to determine the&#xD;
      effect of foot reflexology applied to dialysis patients on sleep, anxiety and quality of&#xD;
      life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Reflexology is defined as a holistic treatment based on stimulating the nerves and blood&#xD;
      circulation in the body by manually stimulating the reflex points in the hands and feet&#xD;
      corresponding to all parts of the body, organs and systems. In the literature, there are many&#xD;
      studies conducted in different samples to evaluate the effectiveness of reflexology massage.&#xD;
      Hemodialysis patients are also included in these samples. Hemodialysis patients are faced&#xD;
      with many physical and emotional symptoms such as lifestyle changes, psychosocial effects,&#xD;
      side effects due to treatment, during their treatment process. Nurses play an important role&#xD;
      in alleviating and eliminating these complaints. Objective: It is aimed to determine the&#xD;
      effect of foot reflexology applied to dialysis patients on sleep, anxiety and quality of&#xD;
      life. Design: Randomized, controlled, prospective study. Setting: University Hospital&#xD;
      Hemodialysis Center in Izmir. Patients: Forty patients receiving hemodialysis treatment.&#xD;
      Interventions: Nine sessions of reflexology massage will be given to reflex points including&#xD;
      the solar plexus, brain, pituitary, thyroid, diaphragm, upper lymphs, lung, spinal cord and&#xD;
      adrenal glands. Main Outcome Measures: sleep, anxiety, and quality of life.&#xD;
