  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Around 230 million major procedures are performed worldwide each year. Postoperative&#xD;
      complications after major surgery, especially in solid organ transplants, are associated with&#xD;
      a significant increase in costs and mortality. Major bleeding episodes in major surgeries&#xD;
      such as liver transplantation are related to a significant impact on morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this multicenter study, we aimed to compare the efficacy of tranexamic acid when compared&#xD;
      to placebo, administered after anesthetic induction and in continuous infusion during the&#xD;
      procedure, on the rate of intraoperative bleeding in adult patients undergoing liver&#xD;
      transplantation. Considering its mechanism of action and its pharmacological and clinical&#xD;
      properties, we expect to observe a significant reduction in the bleeding rate and in the need&#xD;
      for blood components in the perioperative period of adult patients undergoing orthotopic&#xD;
      liver transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, only adult ASA III to IV patients (18 to 70 years old), scheduled for&#xD;
      orthotopic liver transplantation at the Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre, Santa Casa de&#xD;
      Porto Alegre and at the Hospital das Clínicas of the University of Sao Paulo will be&#xD;
      included. Exclusion criteria consider patients with a history of acute arterial thrombosis or&#xD;
      venous thromboembolism (&lt;1 month), patients with a history of known thrombophilia,&#xD;
      Budd-Chiari syndrome, primary biliary cholangitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, patients&#xD;
      with reduced left ventricular function ( ejection fraction &lt;40%), pulmonary hypertension,&#xD;
      preoperative pulmonary edema, or severe preoperative hemodynamic changes requiring the use of&#xD;
      vasoactive drugs, planned use of tranexamic acid systemically during surgery,&#xD;
      hypersensitivity or known allergy to acid tranexamic, history of seizure disorder, patients&#xD;
      who have recently suffered a stroke or myocardial infarction (&lt;1 month), patients with&#xD;
      subarachnoid hemorrhage in the last 30 days and patients previously undergoing cranial&#xD;
      neurosurgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Major bleeding in this study will be defined as bleeding that results in hemoglobin ≤ 8.0 g /&#xD;
      dL and the patient receiving a transfusion of ≥ 1 unit of red blood cells; results in a drop&#xD;
      in hemoglobin ≥ 4.0 g / dL and the patient receives a transfusion of ≥ 1 unit of red blood&#xD;
      cells; results in the patient receiving a transfusion of ≥ 4 units of red blood cells over a&#xD;
      24-hour period; or bleeding leading to surgical reintervention.&#xD;

      In this study, only adult ASA III to IV patients (18 to 70 years old), scheduled for&#xD;
      orthotopic liver transplantation at the Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre, Santa Casa de&#xD;
      Porto Alegre and at the Hospital das Clínicas of the Faculty of Medicine, will be included.&#xD;
      Medicine at the University of São Paulo. All hospitals involved will be of equal importance,&#xD;
      varying participation according to the number of liver transplant surgeries performed at the&#xD;
      institutions. Patients with a history of acute arterial thrombosis or venous thromboembolism&#xD;
      (&lt;1 month), patients with a history of known thrombophilia, Budd-Chiari syndrome, primary&#xD;
      biliary cholangitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, patients with reduced left ventricular&#xD;
      function ( ejection fraction &lt;40%), pulmonary hypertension, preoperative pulmonary edema, or&#xD;
      severe preoperative hemodynamic changes requiring the use of vasoactive drugs, planned use of&#xD;
      tranexamic acid systemically during surgery, hypersensitivity or known allergy to acid&#xD;
      tranexamic, history of seizure disorder, patients who have recently suffered a stroke or&#xD;
      myocardial infarction (&lt;1 month), patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage in the last 30 days&#xD;
      and patients previously undergoing cranial neurosurgery. Patients with chronic dialysis&#xD;
      kidney disease or patients in need of a liver-kidney transplant will also be excluded from&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To calculate the sample size, considering a 95% confidence interval and an 80% power and&#xD;
      aiming to detect a statistical difference in the incidence of major bleeding of approximately&#xD;
      24% in patients in the placebo group and 14% among patients exposed to tranexamic acid, a&#xD;
      sample of 128 patients was estimated, approximately 64 patients for each study group. The&#xD;
      main outcome considered for the calculation of the sample size was the presence of major&#xD;
      bleeding requiring transfusion in the perioperative period (intraoperative and in the first&#xD;
      24 hours postoperatively). In order to overcome possible losses during the treatment&#xD;
      protocol, the estimated sample will be increased by approximately 10% in its final number,&#xD;
      totaling an estimated sample of 140 patients divided into two treatment groups or arms (70&#xD;
      patients for each study group) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Major bleeding in this study will be defined as bleeding that results in hemoglobin ≤ 8.0 g /&#xD;
      dL and the patient receiving a transfusion of ≥ 1 unit of red blood cells; results in a drop&#xD;
      in hemoglobin ≥ 4.0 g / dL and the patient receives a transfusion of ≥ 1 unit of red blood&#xD;
      cells; results in the patient receiving a transfusion of ≥ 4 units of red blood cells over a&#xD;
      24-hour period; or bleeding leading to surgical reintervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bleeding in the postoperative period during the hospitalization of the patient in the&#xD;
      intensive care unit (ICU) will be assessed by the nursing staff through the flow of abdominal&#xD;
      drains routinely used in liver transplant surgery and recorded in medical records every six&#xD;
      hours or before bleeding. increased. In addition to bleeding, clinical, hemodynamic and&#xD;
      laboratory / gasometric parameters will be considered for clinical or surgical intervention&#xD;
      in the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample calculation for this study was based on two recent previous studies. An&#xD;
      observational study demonstrated the need for transfusion of at least one unit of packed red&#xD;
      blood cells in approximately 24% of liver transplants and a recent systematic review&#xD;
      demonstrated a reduction of approximately 41% in the transfusion rate of blood components&#xD;
      related to intraoperative administration of tranexamic acid when compared to placebo in&#xD;
      patients undergoing major non-cardiac and non-orthopedic surgeries.&#xD;
