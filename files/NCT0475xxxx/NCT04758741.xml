    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized controlled counseling intervention with pre-test, post-test and&#xD;
      control groups. After obtaining informed consent from 80 women affected by domestic violence&#xD;
      that referred to the health centers of the villages covered by Al-Kooh Mashhad Health Center&#xD;
      (Mashhad Al-Kooh Health Center, Michan, Mosleh Abad) and Mashhad Al-Kobeh Health Center, and&#xD;
      are eligible to enter Rct are. A woman who has been subjected to domestic violence is someone&#xD;
      who has obtained at least one score on the (cts2) questionnaire .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then, these people are randomly divided into two groups of intervention (n = 40) and control&#xD;
      (n = 40). The members of the intervention group in groups of 10 are treated in 8 sessions of&#xD;
      90 minutes once a week based on &quot;acceptance and commitment treatment&quot; based on Hayes (2006)&#xD;
      approach by a trained consultant (researcher) in Mashhad AL-koubeh Health Center. The control&#xD;
      group also receives 8 counseling sessions once a week by the same &quot;health education&quot;&#xD;
      consultant in groups of 10 at the same center. One week after the end of the eighth session&#xD;
      and one month later, the questionnaires are completed again by trained questioners for both&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The instruments studied in this study include demographic questionnaire, conflict resolution&#xD;
      tactics questionnaire (cts 2) and resilience questionnaire (Connor-Davidson). Data analysis&#xD;
      is performed using descriptive and inferential statistics with SPSS software version 23.&#xD;

      Sampling:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this project, (80 people) eligible women (with at least one score from the CTS2&#xD;
      questionnaire) are selected through available health centers in the villages covered by&#xD;
      Mashhad-e-Kobeh Health Center and Mashhad-e-Koboeh Health Center by available sampling&#xD;
      method. They are randomly divided into intervention and control groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization type:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization is blockchain. 20 blocks with a volume of 4 are used, two allocations for the&#xD;
      control group and two allocations for the intervention group. Random sequencing is done using&#xD;
      a web-based random site (https://www.sealedenvelope.com).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sequence Hiding: Sequence hiding is when someone outside the research team has a random&#xD;
      assignment list. As soon as a person is eligible to participate in the study, the sampler&#xD;
      contacts the person who has a random assignment sequence and he / she gives the code to the&#xD;
      participants to enter the study according to the sequence list.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acceptance and commitment therapy sessions are held by a researcher who has learned the&#xD;
      workshop before starting the project. In the evaluation phase, one week and one month after&#xD;
      the intervention, the questionnaires are completed by trained questioners. The statistical&#xD;
      consultant who will help analyze the data is unaware of the codes of the participants in the&#xD;
      groups. Therefore, the study will be of the three-blind type.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires are completed by pre-intervention interviews by trained researchers and&#xD;
      samplers and in the evaluation phase after the intervention and follow-up by trained&#xD;
      interviewers. Before starting the study, questioners with high public and social relations&#xD;
      are selected for sampling and during a session, the necessary training is given to them by&#xD;
      the researcher. During the briefing, the objectives of the study and the work process, the&#xD;
      sampling method, the confidentiality of customer information and the privacy of the&#xD;
      participant, and all ethical principles related to domestic violence research are taught to&#xD;
      the samplers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection tools:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The instruments studied in this study include Demographic Questionnaire, CTS2 Conflict&#xD;
      Resolution Tactics Questionnaire (to determine the status of violence) and Connor and&#xD;
      Davidson Resilience Questionnaire (to determine the status of resilience).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acceptance and commitment to therapy affect women's resilience to domestic violence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      all purpose: The effect of treatment acceptance and commitment on the resilience of women&#xD;
      affected by domestic violence is determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determining and comparing the mean resilience score in the intervention and control groups,&#xD;
      before, one week after the intervention and one month after the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the effectiveness of acceptance and commitment therapy in improving the resilience of&#xD;
      women affected by domestic violence is confirmed, this intervention method can be used in&#xD;
      counseling centers and its use can be taught to service providers, especially midwives.&#xD;
      Applying this method will probably be effective in reducing the rate of violence and mutual&#xD;
      violence against women, promoting women's health, improving marital relations and marital&#xD;
      satisfaction, strengthening the family and reducing the rate of divorce.&#xD;
