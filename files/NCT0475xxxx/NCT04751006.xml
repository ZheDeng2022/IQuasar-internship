      Effects of balance training with and without gaze stabilization exercises on clinical&#xD;
      outcomes in elderly patients with chronic dizziness: A Randomized Controlled Trial&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In older adults dizziness is a common condition which is associated with repeated falls, fear&#xD;
      of falling, depression, anxiety and ultimately loss of independence during activities of&#xD;
      daily living. The main objective of this research was to compare the effects of balance&#xD;
      training with and without Gaze Stabilization exercises on clinical outcomes in elderly&#xD;
      patient with chronic dizziness.Total 64 participants after referral from neurologist were&#xD;
      recruited in this study. These participants were randomly assigned into two groups i.e. Group&#xD;
      A (Gaze group) and Group B (control group) with 32 participants in each group by sealed&#xD;
      envelope method. Gaze group performed balance exercises with gaze stability exercises. Gaze&#xD;
      stability exercises are further classified as adaptation and substitution exercises.&#xD;
      Adaptation exercises support long term changes with a purpose of decreasing symptoms and&#xD;
      maintain postural stability. On the other hand the substitution exercises improving central&#xD;
      preprogrammed movement of eyes. Basically gaze stability exercises are defined as habituation&#xD;
      exercises which reduce the symptoms of provoking stimulus by continuous exposure to it&#xD;
      whereas, group B performed balance exercises with saccade eye exercises.Balance training&#xD;
      includes both static and dynamic balance exercises, aimed to improved balance and postural&#xD;
      stability with gradually increasing to challenging task. Exercises in balance training&#xD;
      included a) single leg balance on firm surface b) heel stand c) marching on firm surface d)&#xD;
      toe stand e) tandem walk f) forward and backward walking from normal base of support to&#xD;
      weekly progression and training from eyes open to eye close from stable to unstable surface.&#xD;
      Berg Balance Scale, Disability Handicapped inventory and Activity Specific Balance Confidence&#xD;
      Scale were used to measure outcome variables.&#xD;

    <description>Gaze group performed balance exercises with gaze stability exercise.Gaze stability exercises included two types of exercises vestibular adaptation and substitution exercises. In Adaptation exercises individual need to fixate on a visual target during horizontal and vertical head movement with a purpose of increasing gaze stability and a long term gain to vestibular system. Subsitution exercises are planned to use other eye movement stratigies to substitute vestibular function and sustained visual fixation. During Substitution exercises individual need to perfomed eye head movement between target with a purpose of clear sighting during these tasks. Balance exercises consist of both static and dynamic balance exercises with weekly progression making balance exercises more challenging.</description>

    <description>Participants performed balance training with saccade eye exercises.balance exercises included both static and dynamic balance exercises with a purpose of increasing mobility and stability of a posture by weekly progression. These exercises included standing on firm and foam surface with eyes open or close, heel stand, toe stand, marching on firm surface, forward and backward walking with normal base of support with weekly progression. Each task was performed for 5 repetitions with weekly progression in each task.</description>
