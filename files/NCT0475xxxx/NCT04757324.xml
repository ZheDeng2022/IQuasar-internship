  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We aimed to examine the influence of breast milk and breastfeeding education given in the&#xD;
      ante-natal period on LATCH score and breastfeeding self-efficacy score.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Practices for increasing breastfeeding self-efficacy are of vital importance and they&#xD;
      increase the level of breastfeeding self-efficacy. Breast milk and breastfeeding educations&#xD;
      have given in the ante-natal period are another way of increasing the success of&#xD;
      breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this experimental investigation, 80 pregnant women who attended a baby-friendly hospital&#xD;
      were randomly assigned to the education (n = 40) or control (n = 40) groups. The pregnant&#xD;
      women in the intervention group received 4 hours of human milk and breastfeeding educational&#xD;
      sessions along with routine care and furthermore, a brochure prepared by the researcher was&#xD;
      given. All women whose estimated delivery date had approximated were questioned about whether&#xD;
      they had given birth or not, and the sociodemographic data form, the LATCH Breastfeeding&#xD;
      Assessment Tool and the Breastfeeding Self-efficacy Scale-short form were applied to the&#xD;
      subjects in the education and the control group by visiting them at home when the post-partum&#xD;
      first week had been completed.&#xD;
