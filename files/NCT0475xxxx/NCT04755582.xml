      To compare the accuracy of novel smartphone or wearable ECG devices to a gold standard ECG in&#xD;
      patients with normal and abnormal ECGs.&#xD;

      Assess the effect of the following on the accuracy of the recorded ECG compared to a gold&#xD;
      standard ECG:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Posture or position of the patient&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Movement&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Amount of hair on the ECG site&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Skin condition (tone/dryness) Ability to detect a paced rhythm accurately A qualitative&#xD;
           assessment of ECG devices, including the amount of artefact in the signal and ease of&#xD;
           use of the device&#xD;
