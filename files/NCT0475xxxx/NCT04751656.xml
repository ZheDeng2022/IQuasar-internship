  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To prevent weight gain while overcoming these common barriers to engaging in weight&#xD;
      management interventions, we propose an intervention that prescribes self-weighing but does&#xD;
      not prescribe changes in diet or physical activity behaviors or require attendance at&#xD;
      didactic-focused meetings. The potential of self-weighing to promote weight management is&#xD;
      supported both by self-regulatory theory and empirical research. Promoting self-weighing may&#xD;
      activate participants' self-regulatory skills, leading to spontaneous decisions to reduce&#xD;
      calorie intake or increase physical activity, thus preventing further weight gain. The&#xD;
      proposed intervention will also provide individuals with text message-based feedback to&#xD;
      promote continued self-weighing and to motivate engagement with evidence-based resources for&#xD;
      weight management at a time when they may be more open to using these resources-e.g., after&#xD;
      experiencing a small weight gain. The current proposal will investigate the feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability of this low burden self-weighing intervention in order to prepare for a&#xD;
      fully-powered, pragmatic randomized controlled trial. We will enroll 40 patients with either&#xD;
      obesity or overweight with a weight-related comorbidity and who have declined to participate&#xD;
      in a comprehensive behavioral weight management program. Participants will be asked to weigh&#xD;
      themselves daily via a &quot;smart&quot; scale that transmits weight data directly to the study team&#xD;
      via the cellular network. Every-other week, participants will be sent text messages providing&#xD;
      brief feedback encouraging continued self-weighing. Moreover, if a small weight gain is&#xD;
      observed, participants will be sent text messages aiming to engage them in commercial or&#xD;
      community-based evidence-based weight management resources. In a single-arm design, all&#xD;
      enrolled participants will receive the intervention for 12 months and will complete&#xD;
      assessments at 3 and 12 months to assess feasibility and acceptability of the intervention&#xD;
      and trial design, while weight will be obtained from participants' Electronic Health Records&#xD;
      (EHR). We will evaluate our success in meeting pre-specified metrics for trial feasibility&#xD;
      and intervention acceptability outcomes, including intervention enrollment, intervention&#xD;
      satisfaction, and obtainment of weight data abstracted from participants' EHRs. We will also&#xD;
      evaluate the success of the intervention in promoting regular self-weighing and use of&#xD;
      evidence-based weight management resources.&#xD;

    <description>(NOTE: this is a pilot study and there is not a true primary outcome. There are several descriptive outcomes that will inform our decision to proceed to a traditional, fully powered clincial trial).&#xD;
Intervention satisfaction will be measured on a on 12-item study specific questionnaire asking about satisfaction with various aspects of program, such as usability, helpfulness, and if they would recommend program to a friend. This is a study specific measure without a measure name. Items will be presented separately and not combined for a total scale.&#xD;
Descriptive data (means, SD, range) will be presented on each item. For some items, higher numbers is better and for other items lower numbers are better.</description>
