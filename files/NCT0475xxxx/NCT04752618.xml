  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of the combined interventions, Skills&#xD;
      Training in Affective and Interpersonal Regulation (STAIR) and Parent-Child Interaction&#xD;
      Therapy (PCIT) or P-STAIR, for treating maternal PTSD and reducing maltreatment recidivism.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a two-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT): P-STAIR (23 sessions) vs.&#xD;
      supportive counseling (SC) (23 sessions). Eligible cases are randomized to P-STAIR and SC in&#xD;
      a 1:1 ratio. Participants will be mothers receiving family preservation services (FPS), with&#xD;
      a child in the age range of 1-8 years old, and PTSD (with/without depression). Symptom&#xD;
      progress will be measured at pre-treatment, two in-treatment assessments (9 weeks and 16&#xD;
      weeks), post-treatment, and at a 6-month follow-up.&#xD;

    <measure>Clinician-administered Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline (pre-treatment) to mid-treatment at session 16 to upon completion of treatment (an average of 43 weeks) to six-month follow-up after treatment completion</time_frame>
    <description>Clinician-administered Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) is a 30-item structured interview developed by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs National Center for PTSD. It yields a categorical measure of diagnosis and a severity score. Severity scores are calculated from 20 DSM-5 PTSD symptoms and range from 0 (&quot;absent&quot;) to 80 (&quot;extreme&quot;). It has strong reliability/validity. CAPS-5 will be used to assess change in PTSD diagnosis criteria and severity over treatment implementation. CAPS-5 is also used during the baseline to evaluate for inclusion/exclusion criteria.</description>

    <measure>Dyadic Parent-Child Interaction Coding System-IV (DPICS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline (pre-treatment) to mid-treatment at session 16 to upon completion of treatment (an average of 43 weeks) to six-month follow-up after treatment completion</time_frame>
    <description>Dyadic Parent-Child Interaction Coding System-IV (DPICS) examines the quality of parent-child social interaction in three 5-minute situations: child-directed play, parent-directed play, and clean-up. Positive skills include praise, reflect, and describe, and negative skills include questions, commands, and criticisms. Observations are coded by trained DPICS scorers to produce total scores. DPICS scores allow us to track the changes in positive and negative parenting scores over treatment implementation.</description>
