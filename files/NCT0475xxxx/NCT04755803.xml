      Prospective registry and biobank in pediatric patients with congenital penile anomalies&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention, in the United States, one in&#xD;
      200 babies is born with congenital penile anomalies. In Korea, there is a rapid increase rate&#xD;
      among other types of congenital anomalies from 1993 to 2010, from 0.7 to 10,000 to 9.9 per&#xD;
      10,000 cases. It leaves long term sequelae into adulthood even after the corrective operation&#xD;
      has been performed. Some of the sequelae that patients experienced were difficulties in&#xD;
      micturition, dissatisfaction with the appearance of the penis, and decreased sexual function,&#xD;
      as well as psychosexual well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite its high prevalence, hypospadias and related penile anomalies have no specific known&#xD;
      etiology and mechanisms. However, numerous studies have shown that both gene and environment&#xD;
      play a significant role in making etiologies multifactorial. Furthermore, a molecular trial&#xD;
      shows that both genetics and environmental factors disrupt the normal development course of&#xD;
      the phallus, or penis. Penis formation, growth, or the formation of the male urogenital&#xD;
      system, in general, have shown to be androgen dependent. Any defect in the androgen synthesis&#xD;
      leading to androgen deficiency or receptors may play a role, specifically, in the development&#xD;
      of penile anomalies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pediatric patients between the ages of 0 to 18 years, with congenital penile anomalies and&#xD;
      scheduled to undergo penoplasty will be enrolled. In this prospective observational study,&#xD;
      our aims are to collect dartos fascia, which is a tissue in penile region, and examine&#xD;
      histochemistry of the sample.&#xD;

      Dartos Fascia is commonly known as subcutaneous tissue of the penis. It is located under the&#xD;
      foreskin and superficially located on the outer external spermatic fascia of the scrotum and&#xD;
      the axis of the penis. The primary role of dartos fascia is the mobility of the foreskin in&#xD;
      the basal tissue and the blood supply from the external sinus vessels. Furthermore, it&#xD;
      promotes heat loss and cools down the testicles.&#xD;
