  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of suicidal ideation (SI) among adolescents in North America is high, making&#xD;
      it critical to develop evidence-based brief interventions for adolescents with SI that target&#xD;
      healthy coping skills and relationships. BRAVA is a novel brief group intervention for&#xD;
      adolescents with mild to moderate SI and their caregivers; youth are taught skills for coping&#xD;
      and relating more effectively with others. Caregivers learn about adolescent development,&#xD;
      effective parenting and the importance of connection. The goal of the randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial is to assess the efficacy of a virtually-delivered, brief group intervention for&#xD;
      adolescents with mild to moderate SI and their caregivers in reducing SI.&#xD;

    <measure>Suicidal Ideation</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Suicidal ideation will be measured using the Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire Junior (Reynolds, 1988). A decreased score in suicidal ideation over 6-weeks will indicate a positive outcome.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Depression and Anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>We will be assessing youth depression and anxiety with the youth version of the Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale (Chorpita et al., 2000). A decreased score in depression and anxiety over 6-weeks will indicate a positive outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Attachment</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>We will be assessing caregiver attachment with the adolescent version of the Adolescent Attachment Anxiety &amp; Avoidance Inventory (Morretti &amp; Obsuth, 2009). A decreased score in attachment between the adolescent and caregiver over 6-weeks will indicate a positive outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Family Functioning</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Family functioning using the Family Assessment Device (Epstein, Baldwin, &amp; Bishop, 1983). A decreased score in family functioning over 6-weeks will indicate a positive outcome.</description>

    <description>The intervention will consist of 6 psycho-educational group sessions for caregivers and 6 psycho-educational group sessions for adolescents. Adolescent and caregiver sessions will be held separately and will focus on different issues. Adolescents are taught skills for coping and relating more effectively with others. Caregivers learn about adolescent development, effective parenting and the importance of connection. The groups consist of 6 stand-alone modules permitting rolling entry and prompt access. Youth and Caregivers will receive a weekly text message reminder of their exit assessment date/time, homework from that week's intervention group and crisis resources.</description>
