  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ACTIVE is a phase II B efficacy monocenter, prospective, randomized, controlled double&#xD;
      blinded trial, in which intra-discal autologous adult BM-MSC therapy will be compared with&#xD;
      sham treated controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will evaluate the efficacy of intradiscal injection of autologous BM-MSCs in&#xD;
      workers affected by chronic low back pain (LBP) unresponsive to conventional therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy will be evaluated 12 months after the treatment in terms of pain relief (VAS,&#xD;
      Visual Analog Scale), functionality (ODI, Oswestry Disability Index), quality of life (SF36,&#xD;
      Short Form - 36) and work ability index (WAI).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain (LBP) is the main cause of disability in the world, affecting all occupational&#xD;
      sectors with different incidence rates. It is estimated that 60 percent of all workers suffer&#xD;
      from LBP during their careers, 10 percent of which become chronic (The Lancet. September&#xD;
      2017). Intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) is widely recognized as a major contributor to&#xD;
      LBP, responsible for at least 40 percent of cases. A key characteristic of IDD is loss of&#xD;
      matrix integrity and biomechanical functional failure. Today, no therapy can restore&#xD;
      intervertebral disc (IVD) function or provide long-term relief from symptomatic IDD. Current&#xD;
      therapies are aimed at pain reduction. When these treatments fail, several types of surgery&#xD;
      are performed but they are often related to side effects, disturbance of motion and other&#xD;
      biomechanical consequences. New strategies concentrate on treating IDD at an early stage.&#xD;
      Encouraging results from phase 1 and 2 clinical trials suggest that cell-based regenerative&#xD;
      therapies may provide the world first effective therapy for LBP. LBP patients treated with&#xD;
      bone marrow mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (BM-MSC) showed rapid and progressive improvement&#xD;
      of functional indexes of 65 percent to 78 percent over 1 year after intradiscal&#xD;
      administration without side effect. ACTIVE is an ambitious randomized clinical trial aimed at&#xD;
      developing a treatment for IDD based on intradiscal injection of autologous BM-MSC to improve&#xD;
      the quality of life of workers and the disability of patients with LBP. ACTIVE main aim is to&#xD;
      generate efficacy and safety profiles of single injections of 15 million cells/mL of&#xD;
      autologous BM-MSC for each disc affected by IDD (up to 4 discs) versus sham procedure. The&#xD;
      regenerative potential of BM-MSC treatment will be assessed by Magnetic Resonance Imaging&#xD;
      (MRI) technologies on quarterly basis up to 12 months.&#xD;
