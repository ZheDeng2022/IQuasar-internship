  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Wilms' tumour staging and grading are used to give an idea about the prognosis. Advanced&#xD;
      staging, diffuse anaplasia, predominant blastemal elements and lymph node invasion are&#xD;
      indicators of poor prognosis. In spite of using the previously mentioned parameters, some&#xD;
      tumours which were considered of low risk did not respond to therapy and eventually resulted&#xD;
      in mortality. In contrast, other tumours assumed to be of poor prognosis responded&#xD;
      dramatically to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In light of the above, it is crucial to search for predictors of Wilms' tumour prognosis&#xD;
      other than tumour staging and grading. Many immunohistochemical (IHC) stains have been&#xD;
      studied as prognostic markers for nephroblastoma in literature.&#xD;

      P53 is a tumour suppressor gene, and its mutation is identified in various types of human&#xD;
      cancer. P53 protein accumulation in certain tumours is associated with tumour aggressiveness.&#xD;
      The role of P53 expression in Wilms' tumour is not clear; however, most studies confirmed its&#xD;
      correlation with advanced stages and anaplasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ki67 is a nuclear antigen related to cell proliferation, and high Ki67 proliferation index&#xD;
      (PI) is accompanied by tumour aggressiveness, distant metastasis and death. Advanced stages&#xD;
      and clinical progression of WT were found to be associated with high Ki67 PI. On the other&#xD;
      hand, some authors concluded that it may not be a dependable prognostic marker.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) have a role in transitions between cell cycle phases with&#xD;
      the need of cyclins association for their activity. IHC assessment of cell cycle proteins has&#xD;
      a diagnostic use in histopathology. Correlation between poor prognosis and overexpression of&#xD;
      cyclin A was confirmed in different entities of human cancer such as medulloblastoma and&#xD;
      ovarian carcinoma. A recent study deduced that cyclin A overexpression may be associated with&#xD;
      the poor prognosis of WT.&#xD;

    <description>P53 staining density and intensity will be calculated. To assess P53 density in a semiquantitative way, a score of 0 will be given assigned if less than 5% of tumour cells expressed p53, 1 if 5% to 50% expressed p53 and 2 if more than 50% stained positive for p53. To evaluate P53 intensity, a score of 0 means weak or absent staining, 1 refers to the intermediate intensity and 2 stands for strong intensity.</description>
