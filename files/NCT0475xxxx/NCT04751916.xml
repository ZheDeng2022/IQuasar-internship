      1. Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
           Bariatric surgery has become a common treatment for severe obesity, and results in a&#xD;
           loss of fat mass. However, muscle mass is also lost following bariatric surgery. It is&#xD;
           the investigators' overarching premise that consumption of the Essential Amino&#xD;
           Acid-based nutritional formulation following bariatric surgery will preserve muscle mass&#xD;
           by stimulating muscle protein synthesis. As a result, the energy utilization associated&#xD;
           with the combination of maintained muscle mass and stimulated muscle protein synthesis&#xD;
           will counter the decrease in metabolic rate that normally occurs in hypocaloric&#xD;
           circumstances. Maintenance of a higher total energy expenditure by Essential Amino Acid&#xD;
           consumption will accelerate loss of body fat, as well as accelerate loss of body weight.&#xD;
           The investigators further propose that consumption of an Essential Amino Acid-based&#xD;
           nutritional formulation will reduce muscle intra-cellular lipid accumulation, which will&#xD;
           translate to greater improvements in glucose homeostasis and muscle protein metabolism.&#xD;
           The loss of muscle mass in those with obesity undergoing rapid weight loss&#xD;
           post-bariatric surgery, is not in itself, a disease or a medical condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The following aims will test specific hypotheses related to the scientific premise:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Aim 1. Supplementation of the usual diet following bariatric surgery with a proprietary&#xD;
           Essential Amino Acid-based nutritional formulation twice per day for 6 months will&#xD;
           maintain muscle mass and reduce fat mass more than supplementation of the diet with an&#xD;
           isonitrogenous amount of whey protein. Muscle mass will be directly measured using a&#xD;
           novel tracer-dilution technique using deuterium-labeled creatine. Fat mass and lean body&#xD;
           mass will be measured by Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Aim 2. Muscle protein fractional synthetic rate and total muscle protein synthesis&#xD;
           (muscle mass x fractional synthetic rate) will decline less from pre-surgery values in&#xD;
           participants consuming the Essential Amino Acid-based nutritional formulation as&#xD;
           compared to whey protein. Muscle protein fractional synthetic rate will be measured by&#xD;
           the novel &quot;virtual biopsy&quot; method, which provides an integrated value over three weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Aim 3. The pre-surgery rate of total energy expenditure will be better maintained in&#xD;
           participants consuming the Essential Amino Acid-based nutritional formulation as opposed&#xD;
           to whey protein. Change in total energy expenditure will be measured over 10-day&#xD;
           intervals using the doubly-labeled water technique, before to 6 months following&#xD;
           surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Aim 4. Six months after bariatric surgery muscle intra-cellular lipid accumulation will&#xD;
           be reduced from the pre-surgery value to a greater extent in participants consuming the&#xD;
           Essential Amino Acid-based nutritional formulation than whey protein. Muscle&#xD;
           intra-cellular lipid accumulation will be measured by means of magnetic resonance&#xD;
           spectroscopy and magnetic resonance imaging. The investigators anticipate that a greater&#xD;
           reduction in intra-cellular lipid accumulation will be related to greater improvement in&#xD;
           insulin sensitivity in terms of glucose homeostasis and also in terms of muscle protein&#xD;
           synthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Positive results of this study will support the value of the Essential Amino Acid-based&#xD;
           nutritional formulation in terms of increasing the rate of fat loss and improving body&#xD;
           composition changes following bariatric surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Background&#xD;
&#xD;
           Despite successful weight loss and improvement of comorbidities after bariatric surgery,&#xD;
           most patients with severe obesity remain overweight. Patients also experience variation&#xD;
           in treatment response. Up to 30% patients experience sub-optimal weight loss or&#xD;
           significant weight regain. Amount of weight lost and its maintenance are important&#xD;
           because they are what lead to improvement/remission of comorbidities (diabetes, heart&#xD;
           disease, etc.), and to decreased mortality from cardiovascular disease or cancer. One of&#xD;
           the keys to optimal weight loss from a calorie restricted diet, and subsequent&#xD;
           weight-loss maintenance, is losing fat without losing muscle (aka lean body mass). It is&#xD;
           decreased energy expenditure from decreased muscle mass after weight loss which&#xD;
           contributes significantly to weight regain. Muscle mass is the key driver of energy&#xD;
           metabolism favoring the burning of food as fuel rather than its storage as fat. Since&#xD;
           muscle provides a reservoir of amino acids to maintain protein synthesis essential for&#xD;
           survival, its mass quantity is always at risk under conditions of inadequate dietary&#xD;
           intake. Skeletal muscle, under the caloric restriction of weight-loss diets, catabolizes&#xD;
           to provide the body's unmet protein needs. It becomes challenging to maintain muscle in&#xD;
           conditions of severe calorie restriction such as after bariatric surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Protein supplementation has been shown to protect against muscle loss experienced in&#xD;
           weight loss, but only if supplementation is sufficient. The standard of care approach to&#xD;
           maintain muscle mass during rapid, significant weight loss after bariatric surgery has&#xD;
           been dietary whey protein supplementation. After bariatric surgery, protein&#xD;
           supplementation is limited by the inability of patients to take in sufficient calories.&#xD;
           This can be further hindered by typical perioperative complications which limit intake,&#xD;
           such as nausea, vomiting, and early satiety. Therefore, despite standard of care&#xD;
           supplementation with whey protein post bariatric surgery, only marginal gains in&#xD;
           preventing muscle loss have been made. Essential Amino Acid, the intervention supplement&#xD;
           in this study, is a patented formula scientifically shown to be far more anabolic than&#xD;
           whey protein in free-living elderly and young healthy adults undergoing bedrest. The&#xD;
           Essential Amino Acid supplement stimulates protein synthesis 3-5 times as effectively as&#xD;
           whey protein, with negligible non-protein calories.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The importance of the role of muscle in weight loss and its maintenance cannot be&#xD;
           overemphasized. Muscle, crucial to energy metabolism, is responsible for the majority of&#xD;
           total energy expenditure (equivalent to physical activity energy expenditure, resting&#xD;
           energy expenditure, and diet induced thermogenesis - calories required to digest food).&#xD;
           Both physical activity, and muscle protein synthesis comprise a significant portion of&#xD;
           energy expenditure. Through its function in physical activity and protein synthesis,&#xD;
           muscle largely determines the caloric expenditure underlying the ability to 'use up'&#xD;
           food eaten rather than store it as fat.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Obesity, is not just increased body fat, but also increased intramuscular fat. The&#xD;
           intramuscular fat associated with obesity impairs the muscle function of providing&#xD;
           normal glucose homeostasis. Fortunately, when fat stored in muscle decreases, insulin&#xD;
           sensitivity improves. Also impaired under conditions of increased intramuscular fat, is&#xD;
           the function of providing amino acids to maintain essential protein synthesis. Impaired&#xD;
           muscle mitochondria-stimulated protein synthesis potentially decreases resting energy&#xD;
           expenditure, and diet induced thermogenesis. Adequate protein supplementation can&#xD;
           counter muscle mitochondrial protein synthesis impairment, and in theory, lead to&#xD;
           decreased intramuscular fat improving both energy expenditure and insulin sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a double-blinded randomized clinical trial in which the responses to consumption of&#xD;
      one of two different dietary supplements following bariatric surgery will be determined. A&#xD;
      variety of factors related to body composition and muscle metabolism will be quantified in&#xD;
      participants with obesity before and approximately 6 months after bariatric surgery. This&#xD;
      interval of time was selected because additional body weight changes are generally relatively&#xD;
      small 6 months after surgery; most of the weight loss occurs in the first 6 months.&#xD;
      Participants will be assigned randomly by computer to receive either an Essential Amino Acid&#xD;
      based nutritional supplement (intervention) or a commercially-available whey protein&#xD;
      supplement (Beneprotein®).&#xD;
