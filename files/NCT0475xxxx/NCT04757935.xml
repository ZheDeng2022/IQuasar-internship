  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An 8-week yoga intervention to determine the feasibility and acceptability of yoga as a&#xD;
      supplemental therapy in the management of inflammatory bowel disease in the adolescent&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Youth with IBD experience abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss, and psychological suffering&#xD;
      related to their disease process. While many biologic and non-biologic therapies are&#xD;
      available to target the inflammatory component of IBD, youth with IBD could benefit from a&#xD;
      more holistic therapy that addresses psychological wellness, which has been shown, in turn,&#xD;
      to reduce disease burden. It is known that stress (multiple varieties) leads to IBD flares.&#xD;
      It is also known that mind-body intervention reduces stress. The mind-gut connection is&#xD;
      widely discussed in medical circles, however, current therapies have not capitalized on it.&#xD;
      The investigators would like to know if an easily accessible mind-body intervention (yoga)&#xD;
      can improve wellness, lower stress levels, and reduce intestinal inflammation in youth with&#xD;
      IBD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be an 8-week feasibility pilot. Participants will be asked to participate in&#xD;
      online yoga videos and in-studio yoga sessions. Participants will be asked to complete&#xD;
      multiple surveys throughout the intervention and continue receiving standard care from their&#xD;
      primary gastroenterology team.&#xD;
