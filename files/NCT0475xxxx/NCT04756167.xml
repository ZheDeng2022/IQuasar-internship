      In the study, the investigators aimed to investigate the effects of myofascial release method&#xD;
      on pain, functionality and quality of life in individuals with adhesive capsulitis. 42&#xD;
      individuals willing to participate in the study will be included. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomly divided into two groups, the conventional group and the myofascial release group.&#xD;
      Evaluations will be made by another physiotherapist with a single eye blindness. Hotpack,&#xD;
      TENS, ultrasound and exercise will be applied jointly to both groups in the study. In&#xD;
      addition to the myofascial release group, myofascial release will be applied on the&#xD;
      subscapularis and serratus anterior muscles. Individuals will be asked to come to the center&#xD;
      where the research will be conducted for a total of fifteen sessions for three weeks, five&#xD;
      times a week. Myofascial release will be done in the first five sessions of treatment&#xD;
      programs. Participants' pain before the first treatment, at the end of the 5th treatment and&#xD;
      after the 15th treatment with Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), shoulder joint range of motion&#xD;
      (ROM) with Goniometer, upper extremity functionality level Arm, Shoulder and Hand Problems&#xD;
      Questionnaire (DASH) specific shoulder pain and functions will be evaluated with the Shoulder&#xD;
      Pain and Disability Index (SPADI), sleep quality with Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI),&#xD;
      and quality of life with Short Form-36 (SF-36). Statistical analysis to be used in the&#xD;
      investigators study will be made with the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences 20.0&#xD;
      package program.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adhesive capsulitis is a shoulder pathology characterized by pain persisting for more than&#xD;
      three months due to fibrosis and contractures in the glenohumeral joint capsule, active and&#xD;
      passive joint motion limitation and functional insufficiency. Although there are many factors&#xD;
      that trigger this pathology, also known as frozen shoulder, its etiology is not known&#xD;
      precisely. The clinical findings, course and prognosis are known with the researches.&#xD;
      Although its incidence in the general population is %2-5, it is more likely to be seen in&#xD;
      women between the ages of 40-70 and more than men. There are two types, primary and&#xD;
      secondary. Primary frozen shoulder is idiopathic. Secondary frozen shoulder develops&#xD;
      secondary to trauma, immobilization, rotator cuff tears, diabetes, biceps tendinitis,&#xD;
      myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular event, psychological disorders, and post-surgical&#xD;
      causes. Soft tissue contracture and adhesions in the capsule and axillary space are also seen&#xD;
      in the pathogenesis. It is examined clinically in three stages. The first phase lasts about&#xD;
      0-3 months, when the intensity of the pain is high and the limitation of shoulder movements&#xD;
      begins gradually. In the second stage, the severity of the pain slightly decreases, but the&#xD;
      limitation of joint motion gradually increases, functionality decreases and lasts for about&#xD;
      3-9 months. In the third stage, the severity of the pain decreases, the joint movement&#xD;
      limitations begin to recover slowly and gradually and lasts about 9-15 months. The treatment&#xD;
      program shaped according to the characteristics of the stages; It includes conservative&#xD;
      treatment approaches consisting of patient education, prevention, medical treatment,&#xD;
      physiotherapy and exercises, and may require surgical treatment depending on the severity of&#xD;
      the prognosis. Patient education in conservative treatment, hot packs, Transcutaneous&#xD;
      Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS), Ultrasound (US), Laser, Iontophoresis etc.&#xD;
      Electrotherapy agents, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroid&#xD;
      injections, taping, joint and soft tissue mobilizations, manual therapy techniques and&#xD;
      therapeutic exercises such as stretching exercises, range of motion exercises, proprioceptive&#xD;
      neuromuscular facilitation techniques are frequently used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Restriction in shoulder movements is quite evident especially in flexion, abduction and&#xD;
      external rotation movements. Contracture of the ligaments in the shoulder reduces the volume&#xD;
      of the capsule. The capsule decreasing in volume causes limitation of movement. However, the&#xD;
      pain is not only due to the tension in the capsular and ligaments, but also due to the&#xD;
      tension in the muscles and fascia and trigger toxins. Many therapeutic methods are used to&#xD;
      relieve these trigger points and facial tensions. One of these methods is the &quot;myofascial&#xD;
      release technique&quot; that focuses on soft tissues that are particularly tense and in spasm.&#xD;
      This technique is a treatment method aimed at resolving fascial adhesions, restoring the&#xD;
      optimal length of the muscle, reducing pain and increasing functionality.&#xD;
