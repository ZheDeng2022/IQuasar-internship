  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rates of antimicrobial resistance are increasing worldwide. There is increasing evidence that&#xD;
      physiological gut microbiota is a large reservoir of antibiotic-resistance genes. Healthy gut&#xD;
      microbiota is known to prevent the colonization of the gastrointestinal tract by pathogens,&#xD;
      the so-called mechanism of colonization resistance, but this protective mechanism can be&#xD;
      altered by therapies that impair gut microbiota, including antibiotics or chemotherapeutics,&#xD;
      with consequent colonisation of gut pathogens, including multi-drug resistant bacteria&#xD;
      (MDRB). MDRB carriers represent an epidemiological threat to other hospitalized patients and&#xD;
      to the whole community, but are also at risk of developing clinical consequences of this&#xD;
      colonization, including bloodstream infections from these pathogens. Fecal microbiota&#xD;
      transplantation (FMT) has shown high efficacy in the eradication of recurrent C. difficile&#xD;
      infection, and initial evidence suggests that this procedure could be useful in eradicating&#xD;
      also MDRB, mainly carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, current evidence is mostly limited to case reports and case series, and to a single&#xD;
      randomised trial, which was stopped early and did not draw clear conclusion. In a systematic&#xD;
      review of 21 studies and 192 patients, eradication rates ranged from 0% to 100%, and authors&#xD;
      concluded that larger, well designed randomised controlled trials are needed to further&#xD;
      explore this therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy of FMT, compared with placebo FMT, in&#xD;
      eradicating gut colonisation from MDRB, focusing on CRE. The investigators will randomize&#xD;
      patients colonized by CRE (diagnosed by rectal swab) to FMT from healthy donors or placebo,&#xD;
      by colonoscopy. Then, patients will be followed up, rectal swabs will be repeated, and stool&#xD;
      samples for culture and microbiome analysis will be collected, up to 3 months after FMT.&#xD;

      However, current evidence is mostly limited to case reports and case series, and to a single&#xD;
      randomised trial, which was stopped early and did not draw clear conclusion. In a systematic&#xD;
      review of 21 studies and 192 patients, eradication rates ranged from 0% to 100%, and authors&#xD;
      concluded that larger, well designed randomised controlled trials are needed to further&#xD;
      explore this therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The extended aims of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the efficacy of donor FMT and placebo FMT in eradicating gut colonisation&#xD;
           from CRE&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the efficacy of donor FMT and placebo FMT in preventing clinical&#xD;
           manifestations of gut colonisation from CRE&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate changes in gut microbiome after treatments&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will carry out a single-centre placebo-controlled, double blind randomised&#xD;
      clinical trial of donor FMT vs placebo FMT in carriers of CRE Patients will be recruited&#xD;
      among those referred to the infectious disease outpatient clinic of the Fondazione&#xD;
      Policlinico Universitario &quot;A. Gemelli&quot;. Patients with all inclusion criteria and none of the&#xD;
      exclusion criteria (detailed in the specific section of this website) will be considered for&#xD;
      this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before randomisation, demographic data will be collected by the infectious disease staff.&#xD;
      Moreover, patients will repeat rectal swab and stool culture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, patients will be requested to give stool samples to be collected in a sterile,&#xD;
      sealed container and stored at -80Â°C for metagenomic assessment of gut microbiome and&#xD;
      meta-transcriptome assessment by the microbiology staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After baseline assessments, patients will be randomly assigned to one of the following&#xD;
      treatment arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Donor FMT (D-FMT)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Placebo FMT (P-FMT)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in both groups will undergo a single FMT procedure by colonoscopy. Each patient in&#xD;
      the donor FMT group will receive faeces from one single donor. Placebo FMT will be made of&#xD;
      250 mL water. The selection of stool donors will be performed by the gastroenterology staff&#xD;
      following protocols previously recommended by international guidelines and according the new&#xD;
      recommendation imposed by the reorganisation of faecal microbiota transplant during the&#xD;
      COVID-19 pandemic (Ianiro et al. - Gut 2020) The assignment of faecal infusates from healthy&#xD;
      donors to patients will be done randomly, without any specific recipient-donor match, as this&#xD;
      is not recommended by international guidelines All faecal infusates will be manufactured in&#xD;
      the microbiology unit of our hospital. Only frozen faeces will be used. Preparation of frozen&#xD;
      faeces will follow protocols from international guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up visits will be performed by physicians from the gastroenterology and the infectious&#xD;
      disease unit. All patients will be followed up for 3 months after the end of treatments.&#xD;
      Follow-up visits will be scheduled at week 1, week 2, week 4, and week 12, after the end of&#xD;
      treatments, respectively. At each visit the following assessments will be performed: 1)&#xD;
      rectal swab for MDRB; 2) collection of stool samples for stool culture ; 3) collection of&#xD;
      stool samples for microbiome analysis; 4) record of adverse events. Unscheduled follow-up&#xD;
      visits will be offered if requested by the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Outcomes are detailed in the specific section of this website.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistical analysis will be performed both on an intention-to-treat and per-protocol&#xD;
      basis. Differences among groups will be assessed with a two-tailed Wilcoxon-rank sum test for&#xD;
      continuous data and with Fisher's exact probability test (using two-tailed P-values) for&#xD;
      categorical data. Differences in cure percentages will be determined with Fisher's exact test&#xD;
      (with two-tailed P values). For microbiome analysis, statistical differences between group&#xD;
      means will be calculated using a two-tailed Wilcoxon-Rank Sum Test, through the R statistical&#xD;
      software package (R Core Team, Vienna, Austria).&#xD;
