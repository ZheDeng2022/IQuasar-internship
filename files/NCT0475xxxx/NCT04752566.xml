  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, prospective, multicenter, placebo controlled, double blind, randomized&#xD;
      study to investigate the efficacy and safety of eculizumab in participants with severe GBS,&#xD;
      defined using the Hughes Functional Grade (FG) scale as progressively deteriorating FG3 or&#xD;
      FG4/FG5 within 2 weeks from onset of weakness due to GBS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted only at sites in Japan.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible participants will be randomized to receive intravenous (IV) infusion of eculizumab&#xD;
      or placebo at a 2:1 ratio. All participants will be on concomitant IV immunoglobulin G (Ig)&#xD;
      therapy as per standard of care.&#xD;
