  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study objective is to demonstrate the safety of the iTind as compared to the TURP arm and&#xD;
      to further evaluate the efficacy of iTind vs. TURP in terms of subjective and functional&#xD;
      results.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) is the gold standard treatment for relieving&#xD;
      lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) secondary to benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH). This&#xD;
      surgery has proven to have high efficacy with regards to improving objective and subjective&#xD;
      parameters, however it is associated with significant morbidity, lengthy recovery period and&#xD;
      long-term complications. The iTind is a minimally invasive temporary device designed to&#xD;
      relieve LUTS secondary to BPH. This study is designed to compare the minimally invasive iTind&#xD;
      device to TURP.&#xD;
