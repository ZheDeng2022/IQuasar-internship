      The study aims to evaluate effectiveness of the association of endorectal advancement flap&#xD;
      technique with local injection of autologous and micro-fragmented adipose tissue, obtained&#xD;
      with the Lipogems® system, in patients with complex Perianal Fistulas not related to Crohn's&#xD;
      Disease.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Treatment of anal fistula pursues permanent healing and preservation of anal continence, not&#xD;
      always easy goals in complex anal fistulas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with Crohn's disease, simple surgery (ligation of the path and suturing of the&#xD;
      internal orifice) associated with injections of stem cells derived from autologous or&#xD;
      allogeneic adipose tissue has been shown to cure up to 70%. of the cases. Similar results&#xD;
      have been obtained in small series of patients with fistulas of cryptoglandular origin and&#xD;
      also in rectourethral and rectovaginal fistulas of other etiologies. Unfortunately, this&#xD;
      treatment is time consuming and extremely expensive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fresh adipose tissue is an alternative source of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) with&#xD;
      regenerative capabilities, immunomodulatory angiogenic and anti-inflammatory effects. The&#xD;
      injection of fresh adipose tissue, obtained by liposuction from the same patient, is&#xD;
      currently a therapeutic alternative used in regenerative medicine, plastic and orthopedic&#xD;
      surgery indications, as well in other fields. Beneficial effects of fresh adipose tissue on&#xD;
      anus fistulas and fecal incontinence have also been reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the injection of autologous,&#xD;
      microfragmented and minimally manipulated adipose tissue, associated with a surgical&#xD;
      technique that obtains by itself up to 70% cure in order to add the benefits of surgery with&#xD;
      those in regenerative medicine hoping that the beneficial effects of MSC will aid in the&#xD;
      healing and repair process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective study is proposed in 12 patients with non-Crohn's-related complex anals&#xD;
      fistulas. Whenever possible, the endorectal advancement flap technique will be applied; in&#xD;
      blind fistulas and special cases, in which the flap is not indicated, alternative techniques&#xD;
      will be used. In all cases, autologous, micro-fragmented and minimally manipulated adipose&#xD;
      tissue, obtained with a standardized procedure, previously validated and authorized, will be&#xD;
      injected. This procedure uses the &quot;Lipogems ®&quot; device (Lipogems International SpA, Milan,&#xD;
      Italy), with which a well-characterized adipose tissue is obtained with the maximum safety&#xD;
      guarantees.&#xD;
