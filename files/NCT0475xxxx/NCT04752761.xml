  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Two methods for detecting outcomes after knee prosthetic surgery are compared: the&#xD;
      traditional one using paper questionnaires administered in the outpatient setting (Oxford&#xD;
      Knee Score) VS detection using digital questionnaires created on Google Forms and sent to the&#xD;
      patient's smartphone on which the compilation takes place in the extra area outpatient.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PROMs (Patient Reported Outcomes Measures) are used globally for the evaluation of the&#xD;
      results of a prosthetic surgery. One of the most used methods in the evaluation of PROMs in&#xD;
      knee prosthetic surgery is the Oxford Knee Score, usually measured in an outpatient setting&#xD;
      using paper questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to investigate the validity of an alternative method of evaluating&#xD;
      PROMs in which the questionnaire will be administered to the patient digitally (Google Forms)&#xD;
      in an out-of-patient setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questionnaire aimed at the subjective evaluation of the discomfort induced by arthrosis&#xD;
      of the knee (Oxford Knee Score), will be administered during the pre-hospitalization visits&#xD;
      and again during the follow-up visits carried out at 1, 3 and 6 months after intervention.&#xD;
      The digital evaluation will be sent to the patient during the outpatient visits and will be&#xD;
      considered valid only if completed within 48 hours of the same.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On each patient the measurements will be carried out in both methods and differences in terms&#xD;
      of compliance and satisfaction with the two methods under examination will be detected. Any&#xD;
      differences in the final result of the Oxford Knee Score compared to the two methods and the&#xD;
      differences in terms of outpatient assessment times will also be evaluated.&#xD;
