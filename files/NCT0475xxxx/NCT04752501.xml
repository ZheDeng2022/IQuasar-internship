  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized prospective study assessing the impact of psychosocial factors on pain&#xD;
      and physical performance among adolescents with patellofemoral pain. A set of psychosocial&#xD;
      surveys assessing fear avoidance beliefs, kinesiophobia, and pain catastrophizing will be&#xD;
      completed by the participant/parents. Participants will then complete an activity&#xD;
      questionnaire, numeric pain rating scale, and a self-report questionnaire of functional&#xD;
      ability. Participants will then be randomized into one of two groups (psychologically&#xD;
      informed education group and a control group). Participants will view a series of educational&#xD;
      videos (based upon group assignment) and complete physical therapy exercises for lower&#xD;
      extremity strengthening, flexibility, and neuromuscular control. Participants with&#xD;
      patellofemoral pain will then complete follow-up surveys of their psychosocial beliefs, pain&#xD;
      and self-reported functional ability through REDcap at immediately post-intervention, 1 week,&#xD;
      3 weeks, 6 weeks, and 3 months.&#xD;

    <description>Assessment of change of the Anterior Knee Pain Scale (AKPS). The AKPS is a self-reported 13 item questionnaire with discrete categories related to various levels of current knee function. Categories within each item are weighted, and responses are summed to provide an overall score of 0-100, with 100 representing no disability. The Anterior Knee Pain Scale is found to be valid and reliable in patients from 12-50 years of age presenting with anterior knee pain with a test-retest reliability of .95 (Watson, 2005). A change of 10 points represent the minimal clinical difference (Crossley, 2004).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 week, 3 weeks (18-24 days post-evaluation), 6 weeks (39-46 days post-evaluation), and 3 months]</time_frame>
    <description>The Numeric Pain rating scale asks the patient their highest pain in the last 24 hours. The Numeric Pain Rating Scale is a 0-10 scale subjectively assessing a patients perceived level of pain. With 0 on the scale = to no pain, and 10 = to the worst pain imaginable. The use of the Numerical Pain Rating Scale for assessing pain has been validated for use in patients with knee pain and has been found to have a minimal detectable change of 1 points.</description>

    <measure>Change in self-reported physical activity level.</measure>

    <description>Change in Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Physical Activity. PROMIS physical activity scale assesses activity over the past week. Each question has five response options ranging in value from 1 to 5. The responses are summed with scores ranging from 8-40 with 8 representing the lowest physical activity and 40 representing the highest physical activity. Raw scores are rescaled into a standardized T-score with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation (SD) of 10.</description>

    <measure>Change in Fear-Avoidance Beliefs</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 week, 3 weeks (18-24 days post-evaluation), 6 weeks (39-46 days post-evaluation), and 3 months]</time_frame>
    <description>Change in fear avoidance beliefs as measure by the Fear Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire Physical Activity scale (FABQ-PA). The FABQ-PA quantifies the patient's fear of pain and beliefs about avoiding activity. The FABQ-PA is a 5-item self-report measure which assesses an individual's fear-avoidance of painful activity and is modified for the knee. The FABQ-PA is modified by changing the word &quot;back&quot; to &quot;knee&quot; on the questionnaire. Each item is scored on a 0-6 scale, with 0 indicating completely disagree and 6 indicating completely agree. Questions 2-5 are summed to create a final score of 0-24, with high scores indicating higher fear avoidance beliefs.</description>

    <measure>Change in Kinesiophobia</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 week, 3 weeks (18-24 days post-evaluation), 6 weeks (39-46 days post-evaluation), and 3 months]</time_frame>
    <description>Change in kinesiophobia beliefs as measure by the Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia-11 scale. The TSK-11 is an 11-item questionnaire that assesses fear of injury due to movement. Patients are asked to make ratings of their degree of agreement with each of the 11 statements, for instance, 'Pain lets me know when to stop exercising so that I don't injure myself'. Ratings range from 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree). The responses are summed to yield a total score of 11-44 where higher values reflect higher kinesiophobia.</description>

    <measure>Change in Pain Catastrophizing</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 week, 3 weeks (18-24 days post-evaluation), 6 weeks (39-46 days post-evaluation), and 3 months]</time_frame>
    <description>Change in pain catastrophizing as measured by the pain catastrophizing scale-child version (PCS-c). The PCS-c is a 13-item self-report measure designed to assess a child's pain catastrophizing. Each item is rated on a 5-point scale, ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (all the time). The responses are summed to yield a total score of 0-52 where higher values reflect higher pain catastrophizing.</description>

    <description>This 3 part educational video series will teach participants how the body processes nociception and experiences pain, and pain does not mean tissues are being damaged. Additionally we will use the framework called the &quot;Common Sense Model of Self-Regulation&quot; which advocates for education to address five cognitive dimensions: (1) identity (the effort to evaluate symptoms and label the illness); (2) cause (the subjectively formulated belief of what is causing the symptoms); (3) time-line (the patient's perception of how long the problem will last); (4) consequences (the patient's predictions of how the illness will affect them in different areas of their life); and (5) controllability (the patient's belief regarding their outcome and personal ability to change it); Simple methods of cognitive restructuring; and how to respond to activity-related pain.</description>

Even though the final dataset will be stripped of identifiers prior to release for sharing, the patient sample is composed of minors who are a protected patient population Thus, we will make the data and associated documentation available to users only under a data-sharing agreement that provides for: (1) a commitment to using the data only for research purposes and not to identify any individual participant; (2) a commitment to securing the data using appropriate computer technology; and (3) a commitment to destroying or returning the data after analyses are completed. Aggregate data including sample means, standard deviations, frequencies and significance values will be shared through peer-reviewed publications and conference abstracts.
