    <textblock>
      Breast cancer take a leading position in the structure of morbidity and mortality from&#xD;
      malignant tumors among women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Today the interest of many scientists and pharmaceutical companies is focused on the study of&#xD;
      metastatic breast cancer forms. While we obtain little experimental data and practical&#xD;
      research about the treatment of locally advanced forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this regard, the study of new neoadjuvant drug therapy regimen for estrogen-receptor&#xD;
      positive breast cancer in premenopausal woman is very relevant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed research will be the absolutely innovative investigation worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of two modes of treatment, combined hormone therapy with&#xD;
      CDK4/6-ingibitors and chemotherapy (the control), each replicated four times in a randomized,&#xD;
      complete block design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research aims to improve the results of treatment, namely to increase the percentage of&#xD;
      successfully treated patients and reduce toxicity from treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary study endpoints will include the frequency of objective response and complete&#xD;
      pathomorphological response (according to the Miller-Payne classification).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints will include a decrease of the Ki67 level in postoperative material&#xD;
      compared to primary biopsy, the frequency of organ-preserving operation after neoadjuvant&#xD;
      treatment and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study hypothesis: neoadjuvant combined hormone therapy with CDK4/6-ingibitors in&#xD;
      premenopausal women with luminal breast cancer leads to at least the same results as&#xD;
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy, but with less toxicity.&#xD;
