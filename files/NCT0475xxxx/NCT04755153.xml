  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension affects 1 in every 3 adults in the US and contributes to 410,000 deaths&#xD;
      annually. Hypertension and its associated complications disproportionately affect minority&#xD;
      populations living in urban areas. In Chicago, health status indicators show worsening&#xD;
      disparities between black and white residents, with the highest rates of hypertension, heart&#xD;
      disease, and stroke clustering in the predominantly black South and West Sides. Kaiser&#xD;
      Permanente demonstrated that a bundle of evidence-based interventions implemented within a&#xD;
      large, integrated health system in Northern California significantly increased blood pressure&#xD;
      control rates. However, it is unclear whether a health system centered intervention can be&#xD;
      adapted to other settings, particularly under-resourced urban communities. Therefore, the&#xD;
      overall goal is to support a community-centered design and adaptation of the Kaiser bundle.&#xD;
      The investigative team will adapt the delivery model of the Kaiser bundle to be centered&#xD;
      within churches within the South Side of Chicago, one of the most medically underserved&#xD;
      communities in the United States. The proposed interventions are the same as in the Kaiser&#xD;
      bundle (e.g., registry/audit and feedback, simplified treatment regimens, accurate Blood&#xD;
      Pressure measurement) but implementation of the components of the bundle will be adapted for&#xD;
      delivery in the community. The intervention will be carried out by local community health&#xD;
      workers and ministry facilitators, with health clinics and hospitals in the community as&#xD;
      support, all connected through a common data platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the proposed project will identify the best strategies to support adoption,&#xD;
      implementation with fidelity, and sustainability of the Kaiser bundle in the community&#xD;
      setting. The proposed study will follow the Exploration, Preparation, Implementation and&#xD;
      Sustainment (EPIS) process model and implementation is rigorously evaluated using a&#xD;
      multimethod approach to the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance&#xD;
      (REAIM) evaluation framework. The specific aims are: Aim 1: Convene community stakeholders in&#xD;
      order to adapt implementation strategies using the Dynamic Adaptation Process model. Aim 2:&#xD;
      Design, implement, and evaluate pilot projects in order to optimize implementation strategies&#xD;
      within the target community. Aim 3: Implement, test and evaluate an adapted implementation&#xD;
      strategy to control hypertension through faith-based organizations in the South Side of&#xD;
      Chicago. The study uses a hybrid Type 2 effectiveness-implementation design based within one&#xD;
      primary community area (South Side Chicago) and in two settings (church and clinic). The&#xD;
      overall study outcome is the Public Health Impact metric (reach * effect size of the&#xD;
      intervention). Aim 4: Disseminate findings internally to community stakeholders and&#xD;
      externally through creation of community implementation toolkits.&#xD;

    <description>The investigators will evaluate stakeholder perceptions of the feasibility of the Kaiser BP Bundle and how it is being implemented after an iterative community-based adaptation process prior to and during the trial. This measure will use the validated Feasibility of Implementation (FIM) scale (Weiner et al. 2017) which contains 3-items rated on a scale of 1-5 (range: 3-15) with higher scores indicating greater feasibility.</description>
