  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a parallel group, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study. Participants with MDD&#xD;
      (n=90) and HC (n=90) will be randomly assigned (2:1) to receive either lipopolysaccharide&#xD;
      (LPS) (0.8ng/kg of body weight) or placebo (same volume of 0.9% saline) administered as an&#xD;
      intravenous bolus. This will yield the following groups: MDD-LPS (n=60), MDD-Placebo (n=30),&#xD;
      HC-LPS (n=60), HC-placebo (n=30).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are three main aims: to identify immune pathways and neural circuits that respond&#xD;
      differently to LPS in MDD vs. HC subjects; (2) to test whether the strength of inflammatory&#xD;
      changes induced by LPS is associated with degree of change in anhedonic symptoms and neural&#xD;
      circuits in the MDD group, and (3) to identify a biotype of MDD that shows a differential&#xD;
      immunological and neurophysiological response to LPS. The main outcome variables are symptoms&#xD;
      of anhedonia measured with the Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS), cytokines (Il-6, IL-8,&#xD;
      IL-10, and TNF), and BOLD signal change in the neural circuitry mediating interoceptive&#xD;
      processing, i.e. the insula and cingulate cortex. The exploratory aim is to determine whether&#xD;
      the acute inflammatory response to LPS can predict the clinical course of depression over a&#xD;
      period of six months. The main outcome of this component of the study is self-reported&#xD;
      depressive symptoms assessed with the QIDS-SR.&#xD;

      This is a parallel group, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study. Participants with MDD&#xD;
      (n=90) and HC (n=90) will be randomly assigned (2:1) to receive either lipopolysaccharide&#xD;
      (LPS) (0.8ng/kg of body weight; E. coli group O:113) or placebo (same volume of 0.9% saline)&#xD;
      administered as an intravenous bolus. This will yield the following groups: MDD-LPS (n=60),&#xD;
      MDD-Placebo (n=30), HC-LPS (n=60), HC-placebo (n=30). Individuals who are eligible for the&#xD;
      study will be randomly assigned through the use of a block randomization scheme to ensure the&#xD;
      inclusion of equal numbers of HC and MDD participants in each group. MDD participants will&#xD;
      complete up to 10 study visits (V1-V10) while the HCs will complete up to four visits&#xD;
      (V1-V4). At visit 1 (V1), each subject will be consented and will complete the following:&#xD;
      self-report and clinician-administered scales (including the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating&#xD;
      Scale), a physical exam that includes an EKG and vital signs (temperature, pulse, blood&#xD;
      pressure), safety labs (CBC, CMP, TSH, HbA1C, HIV, HCV, SARS CoV-2), a urine drug screen, an&#xD;
      alcohol breathalyzer, and a baselineMRI session comprising the following scans: clinical,&#xD;
      anatomical, visceral interoceptive attention (VIA) task, and resting state fMRI. Vital signs&#xD;
      will be assessed in a supine position with a completely automated device. Blood pressure and&#xD;
      heart-rate measurements will be preceded by at least five minutes of rest in a quiet setting&#xD;
      without distractions. Blood will be drawn via venipuncture using sterile techniques by a&#xD;
      trained phlebotomist or nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects that pass the safety screen return two days later for the experimental session (V2).&#xD;
      Prior to infusion of LPS or saline, the Columbia, EKG, urine drug screen, and breathalyzer&#xD;
      are repeated, vital signs are taken, and baseline (T0) rating scales and blood draws are&#xD;
      completed. A nurse will insert a catheter with a heparin lock into the non-dominant forearm&#xD;
      for blood draws and a continuous saline flush, and one into the dominant forearm for LPS or&#xD;
      saline administration. Prior to the LPS/saline infusion, participants will be hydrated with&#xD;
      500cc of saline. The LPS to be used in the study will be obtained from the NIH Clinical&#xD;
      Center. Vital signs will be assessed every 30 min post infusion of LPS/saline for the first 2&#xD;
      hours (and thereafter every hour). Blood samples will be taken at baseline (T0), at T1, and&#xD;
      then at T2 and T3 (~ peak response) and prior to discharge at T6. Participants also will&#xD;
      complete hourly measures of sickness symptoms (e.g., fatigue, pain), anxiety, depression, and&#xD;
      anhedonia. Symptoms will be recorded and graded according to FDA criteria. Two hours&#xD;
      post-infusion at the approximate peak of the inflammatory response, the participants will&#xD;
      complete the same MRI scans as at baseline. Subject to the judgment of a physician, the&#xD;
      participants will be discharged 6 hours post injection so that the total experimental&#xD;
      procedure will take ~8 hours to complete. Participants return the following day (V3) and one&#xD;
      week later (V4) for mood ratings, blood draws, and identical MRI sessions. MDD participants&#xD;
      will also be followed longitudinally for 6 months (phase 2), in the process completing remote&#xD;
      or in-person psychological assessments at months 1 through 6 post LPS-infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited from the Tulsa metropolitan area through internet, radio,&#xD;
      print advertisements and will be evaluated at LIBR. We may also advertise the study to&#xD;
      students on Tulsa-area campuses using flyers and potentially also recruitment tables on&#xD;
      campus, and discussions with organizations, classes, and faculty where permission from the&#xD;
      appropriate university officials is obtained. A total of 200 human participants (180&#xD;
      completers of phase I) will be involved in the proposed research. Half the participants will&#xD;
      be males or females between the ages of 18 and 65 with MDD and current symptoms of depression&#xD;
      (mild to severe) and half the participants will be HC with no personal history of psychiatric&#xD;
      illness. A DSM-V diagnosis of MDD will be made with the MINI International Neuropsychiatric&#xD;
      Interview and current symptoms of depression will be measured with the clinician-administered&#xD;
      Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), the self-report Patient Health&#xD;
      Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms (QIDS-SR). Depressed&#xD;
      participants will be required to be in good general health (as evaluated during the screening&#xD;
      visit, including physical exam, safety labs and EKG) and to be 18-65 years of age. MDD&#xD;
      participants will be required to have symptoms of depression, that is, a MADRS score of ≥7 or&#xD;
      a PHQ-9 score ≥10. MDD participants are also required to be unmedicated for at least 4 weeks&#xD;
      (8 weeks for fluoxetine) or currently receiving treatment with only one anti-depressant&#xD;
      medication. HC participants will be required to be in good general health and to be 18-65&#xD;
      years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are three main aims: to identify immune pathways and neural circuits that respond&#xD;
      differently to LPS in MDD vs. HC subjects; (2) to test whether the strength of inflammatory&#xD;
      changes induced by LPS is associated with degree of change in anhedonic symptoms and neural&#xD;
      circuits in the MDD group, and (3) to identify a biotype of MDD that shows a differential&#xD;
      immunological and neurophysiological response to LPS. The main outcome variables are symptoms&#xD;
