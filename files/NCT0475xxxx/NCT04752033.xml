  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is being done to determine the optimal dose of spinal morphine and&#xD;
      hydromorphone in patients undergoing minimally-invasive (i.e., surgery performed through&#xD;
      small entry sites and using cameras) colorectal surgery.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intrathecal (IT) opioids have been established as a safe and efficacious modality to treat&#xD;
      postoperative pain. In the setting of colorectal surgery, studies have shown that intrathecal&#xD;
      opioids together with multimodal analgesic regimens provide pain relief superior to&#xD;
      multimodal analgesia alone. Furthermore, in the setting of multimodal analgesia, IT opioids&#xD;
      also appear to be equianalgesic to epidural analgesia while conferring an improved safety&#xD;
      profile. As a result, many institutions have incorporated intrathecal opioids into their&#xD;
      Enhanced Recovery after Surgery (ERAS) pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While morphine has traditionally been considered the &quot;gold standard&quot; in IT opioid therapy for&#xD;
      postsurgical pain, hydromorphone has been gaining popularity as an alternative. The doses&#xD;
      ranging between 0.005 mg to 0.25 mg for hydromorphone12-15 and 0.05 mg to 0.625 mg (with&#xD;
      doses as high as 10 mcg/kg in the setting of cardiac surgery) for morphinehas been found to&#xD;
      be efficacious in this patient population. However, increasing opioid doses are associated&#xD;
      with increased incidence of adverse effects. A meta-analysis reviewing twenty-eight studies&#xD;
      which investigated intrathecal morphine versus placebo demonstrated moderate increases in the&#xD;
      incidences of pruritus, nausea and vomiting. In fact, the incidence of nausea with IT&#xD;
      morphine has been reported to be 33%. While hydromorphone is similar chemically to morphine,&#xD;
      it is metabolized differently. Differences in pharmacokinetics may allow for differences in&#xD;
      side effect profiles. Hydromorphone is more lipid soluble than morphine. This decreases its&#xD;
      spread within the intrathecal space and enhances its penetration into the dorsal horn of the&#xD;
      spinal cord where interactions with opioid receptors occur. Some studies (performed in the&#xD;
      women undergoing cesarean delivery) have also found that hydromorphone causes less nausea and&#xD;
      pruritus than morphine, while others have not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the widespread use of IT hydromorphone and morphine for pain after colorectal&#xD;
      surgery, the optimal dose for neither drug has been established in prospective trials. The&#xD;
      investigators have previously performed a dose-finding study of IT hydromorphone and morphine&#xD;
      in women undergoing cesarean delivery. Briefly, 80 parturients scheduled for elective&#xD;
      cesarean delivery were randomized to receive IT morphine or IT hydromorphone at a dose&#xD;
      determined using up-down sequential allocation with a biased-coin design to determine ED90,&#xD;
      which was found to be 75 mcg for IT hydromorphone and 150 mcg for IT morphine. The follow-up&#xD;
      study performed by the investigators also found no differences in adverse effects or efficacy&#xD;
      between the drugs. The results from the obstetric population, however, cannot be directly&#xD;
      translated to the colorectal surgery population due to pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      differences related to the pregnancy, age, presence of comorbidities, differences in surgical&#xD;
      techniques, and co-administration of IT local anesthetic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study applies the methodology the investigators have previously used in the obstetric&#xD;
      population to the patients undergoing colorectal resection and aims to identify the optimal&#xD;
      dose of IT hydromorphone and morphine that provides good pain relief without causing&#xD;
      significant side effects. Secondarily, the investigators will compare each drug at its&#xD;
      optimal dose in terms of opioid consumption and side effects. Based on their prior findings,&#xD;
      the investigators hypothesize that the optimal dose of intrathecal hydromorphone will be 75&#xD;
      mcg and the optimal dose of intrathecal morphine will be 150 mcg. Additionally, the&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that exploratory findings comparing the two drugs at their optimal&#xD;
      doses will show no difference in the incidence of adverse effects.&#xD;
