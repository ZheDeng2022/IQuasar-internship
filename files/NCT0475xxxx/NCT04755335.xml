  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential of ultrasound perfusion imaging&#xD;
      technique for assessing the progression of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and monitoring&#xD;
      its response to therapy by measuring changes in microvessel alterations and perfusion&#xD;
      variations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The clinical manifestations of peripheral arterial disease (PAD), regardless of etiology, are&#xD;
      due to a lack of blood flow to the musculature relative to its metabolism, which results in&#xD;
      pain in the affected muscle groups. PAD affecting the lower extremities causes claudication,&#xD;
      cramping pain in the calf, thigh or hip muscle induced by exercise. The initial test for&#xD;
      evaluation of patients with claudication is ankle brachial index (ABI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, a non-invasive and affordable US technique that can quantify blood perfusion and&#xD;
      microvasculature density, without using contrast agent, will improve PAD detection in early&#xD;
      stage and can monitor the disease progress as well as the treatment response. The&#xD;
      investigators anticipate that our new cost-effective and non-invasive ultrasound perfusion&#xD;
      technique offers a quantitative imaging of perfusion that would help separating PAD from&#xD;
      non-PAD and monitor the disease progression and treatment response.&#xD;

The investigators anticipate that our new cost-effective and non-invasive ultrasound perfusion technique offers a quantitative imaging of perfusion and microvessels of cuff muscle that would separate PAD from non-PAD and help early detection of PAD and would help monitoring the disease progression and treatment response.</description>

    <description>In this project, The investigators will use Alpinion ECUBE-12R (Alpinion, Bothell, WA) US platform. This state-of-the-art research US machine provides beam formed as well as Plane-Wave imaging options that allow high frame rate imaging. The investigators have characterized the acoustic output of this system for safe human studies and obtained the IRB approval for human studies. It should be noted that our technique is not limited to the Alpinion system; the investigators can also use other US systems, such as Verasonics, Vantage, (Redmond, WA). This technique can be adapted to other modern US machines in the future.</description>
