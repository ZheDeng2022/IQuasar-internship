  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Police work is extreme in terms of the physical activity and physical exertion spectrum as it&#xD;
      is composed of a mixture of enforced sitting and sudden physical exertion. Police officers&#xD;
      remain sitting for the majority of their working hours. In theory, regular physical activity&#xD;
      exerts a number of health and fitness benefits that could act on most issues that police&#xD;
      officers suffer from. Supra high-intensity interval training (supra HIIT) appears to be a&#xD;
      perfect solution for police officers as the training modality can be accomplished in less&#xD;
      than 5 minutes. The primary purpose of this proposal is to create and assess supra HIIT&#xD;
      program that is suitable for police officers and then to assess feasibility of such exercise&#xD;
      program in a small pilot study.&#xD;
