    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find the effects of ELDOA in increasing hamstring length in&#xD;
      patients with nonspecific low back pain.This research will bring awareness about the concept&#xD;
      of ELDOA exercises among clinicians and people to understand its benefits for treating back&#xD;
      pain issues. Further, it will provide an important addition to the evidence-based treatment&#xD;
      intervention of ELDOA&#xD;

      Low back pain is the most commonly reported musculoskeletal condition, associated with injury&#xD;
      and disability in adults worldwide. It is the leading cause of activity limitation and work&#xD;
      absence throughout much of the world . Over 70% to 80% people experience low back pain&#xD;
      somewhat once in their lives . Low back pain affects people of all ages, from children to the&#xD;
      elderly, but it is more prevalent in young adults. Low back pain can lead to decrease in&#xD;
      lumbar range of motion, change in gait pattern, and change of rhythm in the pelvis,&#xD;
      limitations that can restrict social activities. Approximately more than 85% low back pain&#xD;
      cases are categorized as non specific low back pain. Non-specific low back pain is defined as&#xD;
      low back pain not attributable to a recognizable, known specific pathology (e.g, infection,&#xD;
      tumor, osteoporosis, fracture, structural deformity, inflammatory disorder, radicular&#xD;
      syndrome, or cauda equina syndrome) Hamstrings muscle is a postural muscle and as it is&#xD;
      biarticular, it has tendency to shorten even under normal circumstances . Hamstrings are more&#xD;
      prone to adaptive shortening than all other muscles of body .prevalence and incidences of&#xD;
      Hamstrings tightness in non-specific low back pain individuals is high due to limited&#xD;
      activity and lack of regular exercise . The hamstrings length is an essential component in&#xD;
      the basic movements of the human body like walking and running . It is composed of three&#xD;
      separate muscles; include semitendinosus, semimembranosus and biceps femoris which are&#xD;
      present in the posterior part of thigh and help in the flexion of knee and extension of hip&#xD;
      joint . Due to the attachment of hamstring muscles to the ischial tuberosity, the tightness&#xD;
      of the hamstring produces posterior pelvic tilt which stops the flexion of hips during&#xD;
      forward bending so reducing the lordosis of the lumbar spine. It may impair spinal loading&#xD;
      and alter the Lumbar Pelvic Rhythm which will generate more strain on the lumbar segment&#xD;
      giving rise to low back pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELDOA stands for elongation Longitudinaux avec Decoaption Osteo-Articulaire, or LOADS&#xD;
      (Longitudinal Osteo-Articular Decoaption Stretching). A system of exercises and movements&#xD;
      that uses the center of gravity and locates a target area of the spine that needs to be&#xD;
      either mobilized or re-aligned by placing and maintaining tension on the fascia, was&#xD;
      developed by Guy Voyer in Europe more than 30 years ago . The purpose of ELDOA is to help&#xD;
      manage stress and create space in the vertebral joints, allowing muscles to move freely. The&#xD;
      results of these stretches include joint mobility, increased absorption of fluid within the&#xD;
      discs of the spine, flexibility, improved muscle tone, postural alignment, body-mind&#xD;
      connection, and coordination. The tension and release created by these stretches help&#xD;
      normalize the posture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In March-June 2019, a quasi- experimental study of 34 participants was conducted on&#xD;
      Elongation Longitudinaux Avec Decoaption Osteo-Articulaire (ELDOA) in Lumbar Disc Protrusion.&#xD;
      Two randomized group of patients with lumbar disc protrusion were treated and concluded that&#xD;
      ELDOA improved pain and functional status of patients .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Jan-June 2019, another quasi-experimental study conducted with 20 patients, Elongation&#xD;
      Longitudinaux Avec Decoaption Osteo-Articulaire (ELDOA) in Cervical Disc Protrusion. ELDOA&#xD;
      technique was compared with conventional physical therapy treatment. The results showed,&#xD;
      improved functional status and pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In May 2019, an article published in Dynamic Chiropractic, Cervical spine degeneration- Exam&#xD;
      to ELDOA founded significant results on using ELDOA exercises as main treatment intervention&#xD;
      for cervical spine degeneration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2019, A study inquired the combination effect of core stability and contract relax&#xD;
      exercise on hamstring flexibility and concluded that the combination of both core stability&#xD;
      and contract relax exercise better than core stability exercises only and as good as contract&#xD;
      relax exercises in increasing hamstring flexibility&#xD;
