  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep apnea syndrome is a prevalent disease, recognized as an independant risk factor for&#xD;
      cardiovascular diseases The gold standard for the diagnosis of sleep apnea is the&#xD;
      polysomnography. But polysomnography is time-consuming and very expensive. We developed an&#xD;
      algorithm for screening sleep apnea from electrocardiographic signal. This would lead to the&#xD;
      simplification of screening sleep apnea by using a two-channels recording device and&#xD;
      computerizing the scoring of respiratory events. The validation of the algorithm will consist&#xD;
      in comparing the number of apnea and hypopnea per hour of sleep (AHI) detected by the&#xD;
      algorithm from the electrocardiographic signal recorded during a standard polysomnography in&#xD;
      the Center for Sleep Medicine and Research in Nancy, with the AHI resulted from the standard&#xD;
      interpretation of the same polysomnography by experts in sleep scoring (gold standard).&#xD;
