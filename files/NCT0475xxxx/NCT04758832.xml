  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Body mass index (BMI)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It was calculated as the ratio of the subject's height (in meter) and weight (in kilogram) i.e. BMI= Weight/ Height2</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>anthropometric measurement for child</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The anthropometric measurement for child were measured in mm by Auto CAD analysis for recorded photographs from sitting position.it include:1) elbow seat height: Measured with the elbow flexed at 90°, as the vertical distance from the bottom of the tip of the elbow to the student's seated surface, 2) shoulder height: Measured as the vertical distance from the top of the shoulder at the acromion process to the student's sitting surface,3) upper limb length: Difference between the elbow height and shoulder height.</description>

    <measure>anthropometric measurement for school furniture</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The furniture dimensions were measured in mm by Auto CAD analysis for recorded photographs from sitting position.it include: 1) seat height: Measured as a distance from the floor to the highest point on the front of the seat, 2) seat depth: Measured from the back of the sitting surface of the seat to its front,3) backrest height: The vertical distance from the desk seat to the top edge of backrest, 4)desk- seat height: The vertical distance from the seat to the top of the front edge of the desk and 5) under surface of desk height: The vertical distance from the floor to the bottom of the front edge of the shelf under the writing surface..</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Correlation between educational furniture dimensions and the user body dimensions</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 1 year.</time_frame>
    <description>the percentage of compatibility for the ergonomics design of school furniture were tested by using the following equations: Equation (1): Seat height to popliteal height (N +2) cos 30°≤ SH &lt; (N + 2) cos 5° Where SH is seat height and N is popliteal height). Equation (2): Seat depth to the popliteal-buttock length 80%M≤ SD &lt; 95%M Where SD is seat depth and M is popliteal-buttock length. Equation (3): Backrest height:60% H≤ BH &lt; 80% H Where BH is backrest height and H is shoulder height (scapula height). the previous equations represent the correlation between arthopemeteric measurements for the child (the user) and anthropometric measurement for school furniture.The percentage of matching and dis-matching school furniture calculated.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Head postures (angles)</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 1 year.</time_frame>
    <description>Auto CAD program (version 2013) used to determine head postures (angles). 1) Head flexion angle: Line of canthus to tragus with respect to vertical (measured from vertical above intersect). 2) Neck flexion angle : Line of tragus to C7 with respect to vertical (measured from vertical above intersect)</description>

    <measure>scapular postures (displacement and elevation).</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 1 year.</time_frame>
    <description>Auto CAD program (version 2013) used to determine scapular postures (displacement and elevation in mm). 1) Scapula displacement: Horizontal distance between markers at C7 and the anterior border of the acromion (measured in mm), 2)Scapula elevation: Vertical distance between markers at C7 and the anterior border of the acromion.</description>
