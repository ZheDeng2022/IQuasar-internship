  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment with nitrate has shown to lower blood pressure in both healthy subjects and&#xD;
      hypertensive patients.Beside this nitrate have also shown to decrease arterial stiffness and&#xD;
      improve endothelial function.But the effect of nitrate on renal blood flow, kidney function,&#xD;
      water and salt balance and vasoactive hormones is still unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of orally administered&#xD;
      nitrate on these parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be done in a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover study. 20 healthy&#xD;
      subjects will be treated, in a randomized order, with both potassium nitrate and placebo&#xD;
      separated by at least 4 weeks wash-out.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inorganic nitrate reduces blood pressure and improves endothelial function in both healthy&#xD;
      subjects and hypertensive patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This effect is thought to be caused through bioconversion to nitric oxide. Thus improving&#xD;
      risk factors of cardiovascular decease by increasing vasodilatation, salt regulation and&#xD;
      vasoactive hormones.The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of inorganic&#xD;
      nitrate on kidney function, hormones and circulation, which is still unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of 4 days treatment with 24 mmol potassium nitrate capsules on heart rate, blood&#xD;
      pressure, vasoactive hormones and urinary excretion of sodium and water will be measured in a&#xD;
      randomized, placebo controlled, double blinded, crossover study in 20 healthy subjects. Each&#xD;
      subject attends 2x2 examination days at least 4 weeks apart. The examination days are divided&#xD;
      into 8 clearance periods of 30 min. each. The first 3 are baseline periods and in period 4 1&#xD;
      Liter of saline is administered to detect any difference in renal parameters after NaCl load.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If inorganic nitrate supplementation is found to lower blood pressure in addition to&#xD;
      favorable renal effects, it could lead to changes in the general treatment of high blood&#xD;
      pressure and cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
