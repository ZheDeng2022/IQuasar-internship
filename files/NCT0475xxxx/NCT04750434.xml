  <brief_summary>

      To explore the use of PET/MRI in the staging and pretreatment evaluation of patients with&#xD;
      head and neck cancer and to compare this modality to standard PET/CT imaging.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective clinical study whereby an emerging technology, PET/MRI will be&#xD;
      compared to a more standard imaging modality, PET/CT, using newly diagnosed head and neck&#xD;
      cancer patients as subjects. PET/MRI will also be used in this study to explore the merits of&#xD;
      this new technology in determining extent of disease, functional impact, and potential&#xD;
      treatment outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, subjects suitable for enrollment will be identified by the investigators&#xD;
      involved in the study. These subjects will be identified through contact with these&#xD;
      investigators and referred for enrollment per protocol. This protocol will include&#xD;
      determining enrollment suitability based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Once accepted&#xD;
      as a candidate for the study, the newly diagnosed head and neck cancer patients will undergo&#xD;
      both PET/CT and PET/MRI imaging within one week of each other. These studies will then be&#xD;
      reviewed by a radiologist specializing in Head and Neck radiology familiar with PET imaging.&#xD;
      The studies will be compared for any imaging differences. The imaging findings will then be&#xD;
      correlated with pathological findings after surgery to determine if there are any consistent&#xD;
      findings that correlate with adverse pathological findings, if found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific imaging data points to be determined by a radiologist will be tumor and&#xD;
      metastatic disease size, SUV uptake, specific anatomic structures involved with tumor,&#xD;
      imaging irregularities and characteristics of those imaging irregularities of the involved&#xD;
      structures locally and regionally (if present), imaging characteristics of the different&#xD;
      phases of MRI (T1, T2, etc.), and any other notable imaging characteristic.&#xD;
