      Oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy (OIPN) is a common adverse effect that becomes&#xD;
      worse as the drug dose accumulation impacts cancer patients' daily activities and quality of&#xD;
      life.The result of this study will determine the immediate effects of the 8-week auricular&#xD;
      acupuncture intervention on alleviating the participants' OIPN symptoms and enhancing their&#xD;
      quality of life. This study will continue to evaluate the carry-over effects of auricular&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy (OIPN) is a common adverse effect that becomes&#xD;
      worse as the drug dose accumulation impacts cancer patients' daily activities and quality of&#xD;
      life. This study aims to evaluate the immediate and carry-over effects of auricular&#xD;
      acupressure on OIPN symptoms and quality of life for colorectal cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods :&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized trial will recruit 76 participants with colorectal cancer and OIPN from the&#xD;
      oncology outpatient department in Taiwan. The control group will receive usual care, whereas&#xD;
      the experimental group will receive usual care in addition to auricular acupressure for 8&#xD;
      weeks. Outcomes will be assessed by using the chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy&#xD;
      assessment tool, neuropathic pain symptom inventory, pain visual analogue scale, and the&#xD;
      European Organization for research and treatment of cancer-quality of life questionnaire-core&#xD;
      30. These assessment tools are used before the intervention, biweekly during the&#xD;
      intervention, 2 weeks after the intervention, and one month after the end of the chemotherapy&#xD;
      course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultimately, the result of this study will determine the immediate effects of the 8-week&#xD;
      auricular acupuncture intervention on alleviating the participants' OIPN symptoms and&#xD;
      enhancing their quality of life. This study will continue to evaluate the carry-over effects&#xD;
      of auricular acupuncture after the chemotherapy course ends.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This study will conduct a randomized controlled trial by randomly assigning all participants to either the experimental group receiving auricular acupressure and usual care or the control group only receiving usual care. This study provides an auricular acupressure for eight weeks, and assesses the immediate and carry-over effects. These assessments happen biweekly during the intervention period, two weeks after the intervention period, as well as one month after the end of the chemotherapy course.</intervention_model_description>
