    <textblock>
      Extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP), also known as extracorporeal photoimmunotherapy or&#xD;
      photochemotherapy, is a leukapheresis-based therapy that has been in clinical use for over&#xD;
      three decades after receiving FDA approval in 1988. Extracorporeal photopheresis was&#xD;
      initially used for the treatment of T-cell lymphoma. Since its introduction, indications for&#xD;
      initiating ECP were continuously extended to the treatment of Graft-versus-Host Disease&#xD;
      (GvHD), systemic sclerosis, and in the field of solid organ transplantation. There is also&#xD;
      evidence supporting the use of ECP in generalized morphea, a form of scleroderma limited to&#xD;
      the skin, and in eosinophilic fasciitis, which is a rare, localized fibrosing disorder of the&#xD;
      fascia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concluding the results of the published studies, there is evidence that ECP has a positive&#xD;
      effect on fibrosing disorders of the skin. Furthermore, in clinical practice, it has been&#xD;
      observed that patients with systemic sclerosis, who undergo ECP treatment, show improvement&#xD;
      of the skin lesions or a deceleration in the formation progress of such lesions during the&#xD;
      therapy. Same findings can be observed in patients with sclerotic skin lesions of the skin,&#xD;
      for example in the context of a GvHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no clinical studies so far that describe these processes using objective measuring&#xD;
      methods. Furthermore, the mechanism of action of ECP in systemic sclerosis and other&#xD;
      fibrosing disorders with skin manifestations, has not yet been conclusively clarified.&#xD;
      Serological markers for monitoring the progress of the therapy and determining the prognosis&#xD;
      are also missing. Thus, a consensus regarding the frequency and duration of ECP for the&#xD;
      therapy of systemic scleroderma or sclerotic diseases has not yet been reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims at evaluating the influence of Extracorporeal Photopheresis on the quality&#xD;
      and functionality of sclerotic skin lesions assessed by several objective methods.&#xD;
      Furthermore, potential biomarkers, which are being investigated in current studies, are to be&#xD;
      determined in order to evaluate the influence of ECP on those biomarkers and better&#xD;
      understand the mechanism of action of ECP on systemic sclerosis and fibrosing disorders&#xD;
      involving the skin.&#xD;

      Background and Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extracorporeal photopheresis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this immunomodulatory therapy, the apheresis leukocytes of the patients are irradiated&#xD;
      with ultraviolet (UV) A in the presence of a photosensitizing agent, 8-methoxypsoralen prior&#xD;
      to reinfusion to the patient. The mechanism of action of ECP has not yet been conclusively&#xD;
      clarified. However, it has been shown that ECP modulates dendritic cells, modifies the&#xD;
      cytokine profile and stimulates several T cell subpopulations, in particular regulatory T&#xD;
      cells (Treg). The accumulated experience shows ECP to be well tolerated, with no clinically&#xD;
      significant side effects and no long-term complications. Extracorporeal photopheresis is&#xD;
      available as first-line as well as second-line therapy and can be combined with systemic drug&#xD;
      therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scleroderma and ECP:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scleroderma comprises a spectrum of autoimmune fibrosing disorders characterized by vascular&#xD;
      alterations, fibrosis, and subsequent atrophy of the skin, subcutaneous tissue and muscles.&#xD;
      Depending on the form of the disease, internal organs may also be affected in various degrees&#xD;
      (e.g. alimentary tract, lungs, heart, kidney, central nervous system). It is usually&#xD;
      classified into systemic sclerosis (generalized scleroderma) and morphea (localized&#xD;
      scleroderma), distinguished by visceral involvement in the generalized form and disease&#xD;
      limited to the skin and subcutaneous tissue in the localized form. Prognosis depends mainly&#xD;
      on renal, cardiac and pulmonary manifestations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathogenesis of scleroderma is not well understood. However, it is assumed that there is&#xD;
      an initial damage to endothelial cells, a subsequent inflammatory reaction in which mainly&#xD;
      T-lymphocytes, macrophages and mast cells are pathologically altered, and an activation of&#xD;
      fibroblasts causing increased and disturbed collagen production, which finally leads to&#xD;
      fibrosis. In addition, alterations in the innate and acquired immune response, a disturbed&#xD;
      microcirculation and fibroblast dysfunction are also involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The therapy of patients with scleroderma is very limited. It is based on immunosuppression,&#xD;
      which includes systemic steroids, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, mycophenolate&#xD;
      mofetil or interferons. Phototherapy is also a major component in the treatment of&#xD;
      Scleroderma and ranges from narrowband to broadband UVB, UVA, UVA1, Psoralen-UVA (PUVA), and&#xD;
      ECP. The key advantage of ECP for the treatment of scleroderma is the improvement of its skin&#xD;
      manifestations. Nevertheless, there is also emerging evidence that suggests that ECP may play&#xD;
      a role improving oral aperture size, joint mobility, skin ulcers and functional status.&#xD;
      Furthermore, in contrast to the available immunosuppressive therapies, ECP has a low side&#xD;
      effect profile. Î¤he European Dermatology Forum recommends ECP as a second-line therapy or as&#xD;
      part of adjuvant therapy in patients with scleroderma. There is currently no consensus on the&#xD;
      duration and frequency of ECP for the treatment of scleroderma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Graft-versus-Host Disease and ECP:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Graft-versus-host disease is a complex multiorgan disease, which can occur as a complication&#xD;
      following allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Involvement of the skin represents the most&#xD;
      common appearance of GvHD. According to the Consensus of National Institute of health further&#xD;
      sub-classification can be done into acute and chronic GvHD.Corticosteroids are first-line&#xD;
      therapy for both acute and chronic GvHD but due to its significant toxicity and an increasing&#xD;
      number of patients developing steroid-refractory disease, many rescue therapies are currently&#xD;
      available. ECP is a widely recommended treatment approach as a second-line treatment,&#xD;
      especially in steroid refractory form of GvHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eosinophilic fasciitis and ECP:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eosinophilic fasciitis is a rare sclerodermiform syndrome of unknown etiology, characterized&#xD;
      by the fibrosis of the muscular fascia and subcutaneous tissue accompanied with infiltration&#xD;
      of eosinophils. There is little data regarding ECP in Eosinophilic fasciitis, however ECP may&#xD;
      be beneficial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to investigate the influence of ECP on patients with autoimmune&#xD;
      fibrosing disorders, including systemic sclerosis, morphea, sclerodermiform GvHD and&#xD;
      eosinophilic fasciitis. More specifically, the following topics are going to be investigated:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Quality and functionality of skin lesions:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Examination of lesional and clinically uninvolved skin during ECP treatment, using&#xD;
                clinical evaluation and skin functional parameters. If possible, the examinations&#xD;
                will take place before the initiation and during the ECP treatment. This depends on&#xD;
                the stage of therapy of the participants, at the time they get included in the&#xD;
                study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Evaluation of the influence of the frequency and the duration of ECP on the&#xD;
                progress of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Alteration of biomarkers during the ECP treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Observation of specific potential biomarkers during the treatment in order to&#xD;
                understand the mechanism of action of ECP as well as its influence in those&#xD;
                biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Evaluation of biomarkers as possible prognostic markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective, monocentric, exploratory study with a single group of 10 subjects. Ten patients&#xD;
      with sclerotic skin lesions due to systemic sclerosis, or morphea, or sclerodermiform GvHD or&#xD;
      eosinophilic fasciitis will be enrolled in this clinical study. Subjects not having started&#xD;
      first ECP treatment yet will be preferred for inclusion. The modified Rodnan skin score is&#xD;
      widely accepted as a validated method to evaluate skin sclerosis, therefore its results will&#xD;
      be considered as the primary outcome in this study. The study will include 8 visits for each&#xD;
      included patient:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening visit, between week -2 and week 0&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline/inclusion visit, week 0&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intermediate visits, every 4 weeks Â± 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of study visit, week 24Â± 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted by the Clinical Research Center for Hair and Skin Science,&#xD;
      Department of Dermatology and Allergy, CharitÃ© - UniversitÃ¤tsmedizin Berlin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with systemic sclerosis or sclerotic skin lesions who already receive or are planned&#xD;
      to receive ECP treatment will be recruited in this study. In other words, they will receive&#xD;
      the treatment regardless of their inclusion in the study. Normally, a 3-day inpatient stay in&#xD;
      the clinic is required for a cycle of ECP treatment. The study visits will be carried out&#xD;
      during this inpatient stay at the Department of Dermatology and Allergy, CharitÃ© -&#xD;
      UniversitÃ¤tsmedizin Berlin. If necessary, additional appointments with the subjects will be&#xD;
      made in the same setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment strategies:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who receive ECP in the Department of Dermatology, Venerology and Allergology -&#xD;
      CharitÃ© - UniversitÃ¤tsmedizin Berlin will be informed about the study by the study&#xD;
      investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Demographic data, medical history: An extended interview of the patient on his&#xD;
           demographics, medical history, treatments and medications will be performed by an&#xD;
           investigator during the inclusion visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Modified Rodnan skin score: The modified Rodnan skin score is a validated method to&#xD;
           evaluate skin thickening in SSc worldwide.It will be performed by an investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Skin physiological and functional parameters: Skin functional parameters will be&#xD;
           determined at the uninvolved skin of the volar forearm or the gluteal area (control) and&#xD;
           at one lesional skin area (target lesion), which may differ among the subjects but&#xD;
           preferably would be in a contralateral area to the uninvolved skin area chosen. Before&#xD;
           measurements are performed, subjects will rest for 30 minutes in a room with controlled&#xD;
           environmental conditions (room temperature 22 Â°CÂ± 2 Â°C; relative humidity 50% Â± 10%) for&#xD;
           acclimatization. The skin of the investigational sites must be open to air.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Following parameters will be determined:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Stratum corneum hydration (SCH): SCH will be measured using the Corneometer CM 825&#xD;
           (Courage + Khazaka, Colonge, Germany), which measures the hydration level of the stratum&#xD;
           corneum as electrical capacitance. The measurement is based on the differences of the&#xD;
           dielectric constant of water and other substances. The arbitrary units range from 0 to&#xD;
           120, higher readings indicate higher stratum corneum hydration.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Transepidermal water loss (TEWL): TEWL will be measured using the Tewameter TM 300&#xD;
           (Courage + Khazaka, Colonge, Germany). The probe of the instrument measures the density&#xD;
           gradient of the water evaporation from the skin indirectly by the two pairs of sensors&#xD;
           (temperature and relative humidity) inside the hollow cylinder. Water evaporation is&#xD;
           captured in gram per hour per mÂ². Higher values indicate a higher transepidermal water&#xD;
           loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Skin firmness: A Cutometer Dual MPA 580 (Courage + Khazaka, Colonge, Germany) will be&#xD;
           used. The instrument measures skin deformation after repeated cycles of suction and&#xD;
           release. The resistance of the skin to the negative pressure and its ability to return&#xD;
           into its original position are displayed as curves (penetration depth in mm/time) in&#xD;
           real time during the measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Skin surface sebum level: A Sebumeter SM 815 (Courage + Khazaka, Colonge, Germany) will&#xD;
           be used. The measurement is based on grease spot photometry. The measurement cassette&#xD;
           contains a special tape that becomes transparent when it comes into contact with sebum&#xD;
           on the surface of the skin. In order to make a measurement the cassette is inserted into&#xD;
           an aperture on the device where the transparency of the tape is measured. The&#xD;
           transparency is measured by sending light through the tape, using a light source in the&#xD;
           aperture. The light is reflected by a mirror behind the tape and a photocell measures&#xD;
           the transparency. The change in the amount of light transmission represents the sebum&#xD;
           content of the tape, which is displayed in units from 0-350. Higher values indicate a&#xD;
           higher lipid level.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Skin thickness: A Dermascan C ultrasound scanner (Cortex Technology, Denmark) with a&#xD;
           20MHz probe will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Biomarkers: Biomarkers will be determined via blood sampling. Two CPDa tubes and two&#xD;
           serum tubes will be used at each blood collection. Blood samples will be collected at&#xD;
           three time-points during an inpatient stay; immediately before the start of ECP on day&#xD;
           one, immediately after the ECP treatment on day one and at the patient's discharge on&#xD;
           day three. Serum levels of specific cytokines and chemokines will be determined using&#xD;
           ELISA. Percentage counts of specific T-cell subpopulations will be obtained by&#xD;
           fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis (FACS), using the following surface&#xD;
           markers: CD3, CD4, CD45RA, CD127, CD25, CXCR3, CXCR5 and CCR6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A paper source data will be created for this study. Data including demographics, medical&#xD;
      history, measurement results and clinical score results will be completed during the study&#xD;
      visits in written form. Data from the source data will be extracted and entered into a data&#xD;
      file by the data manager using the software IBM SPSS Statistics 26. The database will be&#xD;
      stored on a secured digital server of the CharitÃ© - UniversitÃ¤tsmedizin Berlin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive comparative statistical analysis will be conducted. All parameters will be&#xD;
      described using measures of central tendency and measures of variability or dispersion. This&#xD;
      is an exploratory study therefore a formal sample size calculation is not planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Monitoring: Planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Harms: The participants will not be monitored for adverse events because the study is&#xD;
      considered as non-interventional. All subjects will receive ECP treatment regardless of their&#xD;
      inclusion in this study. Furthermore, all non-invasive measurements as well as the blood&#xD;
      sampling will be conducted during the subjects' planned hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Auditing: Not planned.&#xD;
