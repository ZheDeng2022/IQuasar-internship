  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to prospectively test the hypothesis that specific dietary&#xD;
      modification can improve patient symptoms by promoting beneficial changes in the composition&#xD;
      of the microbiome that, in turn, alter the immune response in such a way as to and ameliorate&#xD;
      inflammatory conditions such as Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). The potential long term&#xD;
      benefit of this research is a validated set of efficacious dietary guidelines for persons&#xD;
      with IBD. The potential immediate benefit to patients is symptomatic relief and healing.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The gut microbiome is the community of microbes that inhabit the gastrointestinal tract.&#xD;
      Sequencing and analysis of the DNA and/or RNA of the gut microbiome (metagenomics) allow the&#xD;
      identification of the species present and assess the metabolic activities they carry out.&#xD;
      Stools are largely microbial and the metagenomics of stool can provide insights into the&#xD;
      functioning of the gut microbiome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nutrient processing by the gut microbiome is fundamental to energy extraction and immune&#xD;
      response. Until recently, investigation of nutritional approaches to treating Inflammatory&#xD;
      bowel diseases (IBD) has been largely limited to the use of enteral and total parenteral&#xD;
      nutrition with the aim of providing bowel rest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IBD Anti-inflammatory diet (IBD-AID) was developed to establish a dietary therapy to&#xD;
      address nutritional adequacy and malabsorption issues, promote symptom relief, and assist&#xD;
      with remission. The IBD-AID has been designed to favor colonic bacteria that degrade dietary&#xD;
      fibers and produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). SCFAs regulate the production of&#xD;
      cytokines (TNF-Î±, IL-2, IL-6, and IL-10), eicosanoids, and chemokines (e.g., MCP-1 and&#xD;
      CINC-2) by acting on macrophages and endothelial cells. High levels of SCFAs then promote a&#xD;
      hyporesponsive immunological environment to commensal bacteria through the down-regulation of&#xD;
      those pro-inflammatory effectors, aiding homeostasis maintenance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This diet utilizes foods that are available in most grocery stores and is intended to be a&#xD;
      complete diet that provide balanced nutrition. As many of the available medical treatments&#xD;
      for inflammatory bowel disease have risks, this diet may be a safer alternative to medical&#xD;
      treatment in this population. The nutrition recommendations are safe. Diet modification poses&#xD;
      minimal risk.&#xD;

    <description>Subjects will meet with study personnel for to fill out baseline questionnaires (approximately a 1-hour visit). Subjects will be instructed to make dietary changes based one the IBD-AID guidelines. Dietary instruction will be delivered via individual and group sessions led by trained study personnel. Participants will be expected to learn the skills of dietary change to the IBD-AID and will begin their 8 weeks compliance period followed by endpoint measures. Participants are encouraged to attend 3 cooking classes (1.5 hours duration) in our teaching kitchen.</description>
