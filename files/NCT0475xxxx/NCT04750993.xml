  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this cross-sectional study, it was planned to compare the frequency of subclinical&#xD;
      synovitis in the distal interphalangeal joints of the hands in psoriasis patients. 28&#xD;
      patients followed up by the Dermatology Department with a diagnosis of psoriasis and referred&#xD;
      to us and 28 healthy volunteers were included in the study. Participants' age, gender, body&#xD;
      mass index (BMI), year of psoriasis diagnosis, treatments they received, and comorbid&#xD;
      diseases were recorded as demographic information. Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI)&#xD;
      and Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI) were calculated by a dermatologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tenderness in the distal interphalangeal joints of both hands was evaluated by palpation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequently, the presence of ultrasonographic synovitis findings of the participants was&#xD;
      examined by a physician who was experienced in musculoskeletal ultrasonography and was blind&#xD;
      to clinical evaluations. Scoring was done with the EULAR GS / PD joint scoring system and&#xD;
      EULAR-OMERACT composite scoring system. The scores of the most affected joint were used in&#xD;
      statistical analysis. Comparisons were made between psoriasis and control groups in terms of&#xD;
      scores. Relationships between variables in the psoriasis group were examined.&#xD;
