  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic wounds represent a huge burden to both patients and the National Health Service&#xD;
      (NHS), with over 200,000 sufferers in the UK alone. Based on current conservative estimates&#xD;
      the NHS spends £2.3 - £3.1 billion pounds every year treating these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to reduce this shared burden, preliminary data from our research group using&#xD;
      animal models has demonstrated variable ability of hair follicles to heal wounds based upon&#xD;
      their stage within their growth cycle. This currently proposed study therefore aims to&#xD;
      perform a simple novel intervention on patients prior to their elective surgery in an effort&#xD;
      to replicate the substantial healing abilities noted in the animal models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Under normal circumstances, a patient's operative site is shaved prior to the surgery for&#xD;
      hygiene and visual simplicity. The aim of this study is to wax 50% of the patient's operative&#xD;
      site prior to their surgery, the other half will be shaved on the day of surgery as per&#xD;
      normal surgical protocol. Based on known data this waxing technique will cycle the hair&#xD;
      follicles into their growth phase at the time of surgery. The growth phase of hair follicles&#xD;
      corresponds with an increased ability to heal due to recruitment of a patients own stem&#xD;
      cells. This study therefore aims to take advantage of the patient's own stem cell population.&#xD;
      The 50% waxing and 50% shaving method upon each patients donor site allows us to directly&#xD;
      compare the influence of these two methods directly on a patient-by-patient basis.&#xD;
