  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Choledocholithiasis is identified in approximately 3-10 % of patients with cholelithiasis.&#xD;
      (1-3) While laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) is considered the treatment of choice in&#xD;
      patients with gall bladder stones, there is a debate about the management of common bile duct&#xD;
      (CBD) stones, (4) and this has led to a range of therapeutic strategies for the management of&#xD;
      concomitant gallstones and CBD stones patients. Two-stage endoscopic management using&#xD;
      endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) followed by laparoscopic&#xD;
      cholecystectomy is a common approach, although single-stage management by laparoscopic&#xD;
      cholecystectomy with surgical exploration of the CBD is an alternative, with the single-stage&#xD;
      approach more common in the open surgery era. Currently, it is unclear whether two-stage&#xD;
      management is better than or at least equivalent to the single-stage surgical approach to&#xD;
      choledocholithiasis. To address this, we undertook this study to compare these two&#xD;
      approaches. The aim of this prospective randomized trial was to determine the best technique&#xD;
      for the management of patients with concomitant gallstones and common bile duct stones, by&#xD;
      comparing the success rate, complication rates, and longer-term follow-up outcomes.&#xD;

      Single stage approach Under General anaesthesia a5 trocar method will be used to access the&#xD;
      abdominal cavity. Aconventional approach to laparoscopic cholecystectomy will be first&#xD;
      udertaken with dissection of calot's triangle. The cystic duct will be pulled laterally to&#xD;
      facilitate exposure of the anterior wall of the CBDand the CBD will be opened longitudinally&#xD;
      for adistance of approximately 1to1.5 cm using laparoscopic scissors. A5mm flexible&#xD;
      choledoscope will be used to identify the CBD stone(s) which will be removed by flushing&#xD;
      sterile saline, passingastone basket, or electrohydraulic lithotrpsy as necessary to clear&#xD;
      the CBD. A T-tube will be inserted into the CBD via the choledochotomy which will be closed&#xD;
      by interrupted resorbable sutures, before completing the cholecystectomy. Cholangiography&#xD;
      throuh T-tube be performed 14 14 days later and the T-tube will be removed immediately after&#xD;
      Cholangiography if no residual CBD stones is identified. If residual stones are found then&#xD;
      will be removed through the T-tube track using A choledoscope Two-stage approach The&#xD;
      treatment process commenced with intial endoscopic treatment phase. This will be udertaken&#xD;
      Under General anaesthesia and entailed ERCP and endoscopic sphincterectomy. The CBD stones&#xD;
      will be removed using a basket or ballon, with lithotrpsy added if necessary. An endoscopic&#xD;
      nasobiliary drainge will be inserted and kept in place until after laparoscopic&#xD;
      cholecystectomy which perfermed 2 to 5 days later depending on the patients 's condition..&#xD;
      Surgery will be delsyed if urine amylase is elevated or significant abdominal pain is&#xD;
      present. 2 to 5 days after the operation, Cholangiography will be performed via endoscopic&#xD;
      nasobiliary drainge tube. And the endoscopic nasobiliary drainge tube wii be removed if no&#xD;
      residual CBD stones are seen.&#xD;
