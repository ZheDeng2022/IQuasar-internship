  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The SIM study is a single-centre, randomized, controlled trial with a 12-month follow-up&#xD;
      period. The aim is to determine which of the 3 methods of follow-up is the most effective in&#xD;
      promoting patient treatment compliance. The recruitment of participants will be done by&#xD;
      invitation, and tests will be performed in a mobile unit in locations accessible to large&#xD;
      populations. The goal is to perform 10,000 quick tests, with results confirmed by venereal&#xD;
      disease research laboratory (VDRL) tests. Patients with a confirmed diagnosis according to&#xD;
      VDRL test results will be randomized in one of three monitoring arms: follow-up by telephone,&#xD;
      follow-up via a game in a smartphone app, or conventional follow-up by a health professional.&#xD;
      All analyses will follow the intention-to-treat principle.&#xD;
