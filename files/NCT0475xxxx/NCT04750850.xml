  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hereditary ataxias are a group of genetic disorders characterized by slowly progressive&#xD;
      incoordination of gait and balance impairments in sitting and standing. Trunk local stability&#xD;
      during gait is lower in patients with degenerative ataxia than that in healthy adult&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the fact that drug interventions are rare in degenerative diseases and limited to only&#xD;
      specific type of diseases and symptoms, physiotherapy is a major cornerstone in current&#xD;
      therapy of ataxic gait. Core stability exercises training could be included as an adjunct to&#xD;
      conventional balance training in improving dynamic balance and gait. Due to the nature of the&#xD;
      interventions, the study will have a single blind design.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The hereditary ataxias are a group of genetic disorders characterized by slowly progressive&#xD;
      incoordination of gait and often associated with poor coordination of hands, speech, and eye&#xD;
      movements. Prevalence of the autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCAs) is estimated to be&#xD;
      approximately 1-5:100,000 populations. Hereditary ataxia may result from: dysfunction of the&#xD;
      cerebellum and its associated system, lesions in the spinal cord and/or peripheral sensory&#xD;
      loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical manifestations of hereditary ataxia are poor coordination of movement and a&#xD;
      wide-based, uncoordinated, unsteady gait. Poor coordination of the limbs and of speech&#xD;
      (dysarthria) are often present. Ataxia patients perceive impairments in balance, coordination&#xD;
      and speech as the symptoms with greatest impact, as well as fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postural disorders in cerebellar ataxia constitute a major cause of poor balance. Local&#xD;
      stability of the trunk during gait in patients with cerebellar degenerative ataxia is lower&#xD;
      than that in controls. To compensate for this instability, walkers increase the width of the&#xD;
      base of support, take smaller steps and increase the duration of foot contact to the floor,&#xD;
      sacrificing swing phase. They progress forward slower, with a lower cadence and preferred&#xD;
      walking pace. This lack of stability is in turn correlated with the history of falls. Local&#xD;
      stability of the trunk may thus be useful when planning gait and balance rehabilitation in&#xD;
      patients with ataxia. Developing core strength is essential for everyday health and&#xD;
      well-being, as a strong core protects the spine, reduces back pain, enhances movement&#xD;
      patterns, and improves balance, stability and posture. However, while motor training programs&#xD;
      have been shown to be beneficial in other neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease or stroke, their effectiveness remains controversial in the field of degenerative&#xD;
      hereditary ataxias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There's emerging evidence that rehabilitation may improve function, mobility, ataxia and&#xD;
      balance in genetic degenerative ataxia. Although these conclusions are based primarily on&#xD;
      moderate to low-quality studies, the consistency of positive effects verifies that&#xD;
      rehabilitation is beneficial. Intensive rehabilitation (with balance and coordination&#xD;
      exercises) improves the patients' functional abilities (level of proof: moderate). Although&#xD;
      techniques such as virtual reality, biofeedback, treadmill exercises with supported body&#xD;
      weight and torso weighting appear to be of value, their specific efficacy has yet to be&#xD;
      characterized. This body of literature is limited by the wide range of underlying conditions&#xD;
      studied and methodological weaknesses (small sample sizes, poorly described rehabilitation&#xD;
      protocols, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is that a program of core stability exercises could improve sitting and&#xD;
      standing balance and gait in hereditary ataxia patients. Secondary objectives are activities&#xD;
      of daily living, lower limb strength and health status of quality of life. After giving&#xD;
      informed consent, participants will be randomly assigned (at a ratio 1:1) to core stability&#xD;
      group or control group. Concealed treatment allocation will be performed via opaque&#xD;
      envelopes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be carried out in accordance with the principles enunciated in the current&#xD;
      version of the Declaration of Helsinki and the requirements of Spanish law and the Spanish&#xD;
      regulatory authority.&#xD;

    <description>Spanish-version of Trunk Impairment Scale 2.0. Each item will be performed three times and the highest score counts. Otherwise, no practice session allowed. The patient can be corrected between attempts. The tests are verbally explained to the patient and can be demonstrated if needed. There are two subscales: dynamic sitting balance and coordination. The first have 10 items and second 6. The highest possible total score is consequently 16 points, which indicates a good dynamic sitting balance and correct trunk control and sitting coordination. If the patient cannot maintain a sitting position for 10 seconds without back and arm support, with hands on thighs, feet in contact with the ground and knees bent at 90Â° (starting position), the total score for the scale is 0 points.</description>
