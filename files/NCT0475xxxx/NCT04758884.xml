  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Management of patients with type 1 Diabetes Mellitus has been changing rapidly in recent&#xD;
      years, due in part to the introduction of new technologies such as Apps that recommend&#xD;
      insulin boluses, or the use of continuous blood glucose sensors. This fact also entails a&#xD;
      change in the care the investigators provide to these patients, facilitating virtual&#xD;
      interaction without the need for the patient to go to the consultation, but having all the&#xD;
      information necessary to modify treatment doses. There are no studies that compare the&#xD;
      influence on glycemic control of conventional management with respect to virtual visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have proposed a randomized cohort study, with the aim to compared the&#xD;
      changes in glycated hemoglobin in a group of patients with DM1 of the reference area of the&#xD;
      &quot;Hospital Comarcal de l´Alt Penedès&quot; followed by telemedicine respect to the usual management&#xD;
      in presential consultation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Classic management of patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) by endocrinologists consisted of&#xD;
      carrying out a visit every 3-6 months in which HbA1c, microalbuminuria and a notebook with a&#xD;
      variable number of annotated controls had been reviewed. In an accelerated way, the&#xD;
      management of T1D has clearly been modified with the irruption of new technologies. Devices&#xD;
      such as insulin bolus calculators, continuous glucose sensors, or continuous insulin pumps&#xD;
      have been appeared and improved. In last months, continuous glucose monitors (CGM) for&#xD;
      patients with T1D have been included in public funding in some cases. This fact is also&#xD;
      associated with a considerable increase in the number of patient data, and new parameters to&#xD;
      analyzed have appeared, with the same importance as HbA1c. Thus, percentage of time in&#xD;
      optimal glycemic range, percentage of time in hypoglycemia, coefficient of variation of&#xD;
      glycemia, or the mean glycemia are new parameters that the investigators have now been&#xD;
      included in the follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The handling of such amount of data has mainly two repercussions: on the one hand, if these&#xD;
      data are well analyzed it is easier to make changes in the treatment, which can conduce to a&#xD;
      better disease management such as an improvement in metabolic control or a reduction in&#xD;
      hypoglycemia number events. On the other hand, in routine clinical practice it has been found&#xD;
      that the fact that patients have higher number of data raises more doubts about theirs&#xD;
      treatment and other aspects of their disease, which motivate a greater number of&#xD;
      consultations, usually telephone or unscheduled, generating a greater delay in the&#xD;
      consultation, occupying spaces assigned to the emergency room or in time slots assigned to&#xD;
      other patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this way, telemedicine could be very useful in T1D management. These new devices allow&#xD;
      data to be downloaded on secure digital platforms that make it possible for the doctor to&#xD;
      have all the patient's blood glucose data without the presential visit of patient to&#xD;
      hospital. Some of these platforms also allow safe communication channels between doctors and&#xD;
      patients (teleconference, chats). The main benefit that telemedicine can provide is that&#xD;
      allow doctors have a very narrow control, unacceptable in routine practice, which allows to&#xD;
      interpreted the large volume of data that is generated and to do treatment recommendations,&#xD;
      which can improve the metabolic control of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date there are few studies on telemedicine in T1D. In this regard, a systematic review&#xD;
      reported promising data in terms of HbA1c reduction in 3-6 months interventions, although it&#xD;
      do not allow a robust conclusion due to the heterogeneity of the intervention in included&#xD;
      studies, the absence of a control group and the small number of patients included2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, the benefits of telemedicine in management of T1D may go beyond the improvement&#xD;
      of metabolic control. It must be considered that most T1D patients are young people of&#xD;
      working age and that in some areas such as &quot;l´Alt Penedès&quot; there is an important geographical&#xD;
      dispersion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, telemedicine could reduce trips to hospital with benefits on quality of life and reduce&#xD;
      indirect costs such as travel costs, lost working hours, etc. In this sense, the Coyote&#xD;
      study, carried out in the United States with a sample of 40 T1D subjects between 18-25 years&#xD;
      of age, demonstrated that telemedicine was capable of improving the quality of life and&#xD;
      saving 6 hours on average between travel to hospital, medical visit and return to work or&#xD;
      university1. It should be noted that this study, which is considered a benchmark in its&#xD;
      field, did not have a control group nor did it study changes in metabolic control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, being able to establish virtual contact channels between the patient and&#xD;
      the doctor with a quick response from the doctor can be reflected in a reduction in the&#xD;
      number of unexpected visits or contacts with the Emergency Department. Finally, it must be&#xD;
      considered that virtual visits, although they are more frequent than face-to-face ones, are&#xD;
      shorter and therefore the total time that doctor spends with the patient does not have to be&#xD;
      superior to conventional management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Use of telemedicine in patients with T1D allows a closer control of their disease&#xD;
      that results in a improve of metabolic control without increasing the number of face-to-face&#xD;
      visits.&#xD;
