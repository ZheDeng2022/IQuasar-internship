      This clinical investigation is a single center patient preference trial in a tertiary&#xD;
      hospital in the Netherlands, designed to compare the outcome of two different recovery paths&#xD;
      after standard of care bariatric surgery. The difference between both recovery paths is that&#xD;
      half of the patients will get the standard of care by staying one night in the hospital&#xD;
      before returning home (group B), while the other half will receive a Healthdot directly after&#xD;
      surgery and leave the hospital on the same day (evening) (group A). 200 patients will be&#xD;
      recruited and can choose whether they want to be assigned to the the regular recovery path or&#xD;
      receive a Healthdot and leave the hospital on the same day. If they have no preference they&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to one of the two groups. Patients in the outpatient recovery group&#xD;
      will wear the Healthdot for 7 days at home and vital signs (heart rate and respiratory rate,&#xD;
      together with context data on activity and posture) will be transmitted to the hospital to&#xD;
      monitor recovery. The study is mainly designed to investigate if the clinical outcome in both&#xD;
      groups is equal (non-inferiority) based on a combined outcome measures like 30 days&#xD;
      readmission rate and patient satisfaction.&#xD;
