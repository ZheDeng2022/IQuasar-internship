      The aim of this thesis is; It was planned to determine the effect of Turkish music and comedy&#xD;
      films on pain, vital signs and cortisol levels of patients who had orthopedic surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research is a randomized controlled study. 132 patients who meet the research conditions&#xD;
      will be included in the study. Patient Information Form, Numerical Pain Rating Scale,&#xD;
      Physiological Parameter Form developed by the researcher will be used for data collection.&#xD;

      Turkish Music and Comedy Film Group Data Collection After the patient introduction form is&#xD;
      filled, pain level, blood pressure, pulse and respiratory rate will be evaluated, saliva&#xD;
      sample will be taken to determine the cortisol level and pre-test data will be collected (0&#xD;
      min). Immediately after the pre-test evaluations, the music group will be played to the music&#xD;
      desired by the patient for 30 minutes, and the comedy film group will be shown a comedy movie&#xD;
      video. Immediately after the interventions, pain level, vital signs will be evaluated and&#xD;
      saliva sample will be taken as a final test (30 minutes). The same procedures will be&#xD;
      repeated in the 60th minute after the intervention to determine the duration of the&#xD;
      interventions applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group Data Collection After the patient introduction form is filled, pain level,&#xD;
      blood pressure, pulse and respiratory rate will be evaluated, saliva sample will be taken to&#xD;
      determine the cortisol level and pre-test data will be collected (0 min).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain level and vital signs will be evaluated and saliva sample will be taken for the final&#xD;
      test (30th minute) and follow-up (60th minute) simultaneously with the administration group&#xD;
      without any intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection of Saliva Samples Salivary cortisol is free cortisol not bound to plasma proteins.&#xD;
      Considering that the active cortisol is free cortisol, many studies have used the measurement&#xD;
      of cortisol in saliva. In addition, salivary cortisol measurement is considered to be a&#xD;
      reliable method for measuring stress, since it can be easily obtained, it does not cause&#xD;
      stress because it is not invasive, and it shows strong correlation between plasma cortisol&#xD;
      levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The concentration of cortisol is at its maximum shortly after waking up in the morning,&#xD;
      depending on the circadian rhythm. It then declines gradually throughout the day and reaches&#xD;
      its lowest level at night. Salivary cortisol also matches the 24-hour rhythm of plasma&#xD;
      cortisol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Saliva samples will be taken at least one hour after the patients wake up so that the&#xD;
      circadian changes in cortisol do not affect the results. In order not to change the cortisol&#xD;
      levels, the patients will be informed that they should not take orally, chew any substance&#xD;
      such as chewing gum, brush teeth, gargle, or smoke one hour after breakfast. It is&#xD;
      recommended to rinse the patient's mouth thoroughly with water for 30 seconds before saliva&#xD;
      sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To collect saliva sample; Saliva collection tubes were prepared separately for all&#xD;
      measurements. Colored labels were affixed on 1.5 ml eppendorf tubes prepared for each&#xD;
      measurement of all groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Red labels were affixed to the tube of the Turkish music group, green to the tube of the&#xD;
      Konedi movie group, and white to the tube of the control group. Numbers given to the&#xD;
      participant and the number of measurements (a = 0 minutes, b = 30 minutes, c = 60 minutes)&#xD;
      were written on colored labels. In order to facilitate the salivation process, the&#xD;
      participants will be given a hookah mouthpiece (sipsi). Saliva collection will be done using&#xD;
      passive flow method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Saliva samples will be stored in the freezer at -20 ° C in the laboratory of the Faculty of&#xD;
      Health Sciences, while preserving the cold chain.&#xD;
