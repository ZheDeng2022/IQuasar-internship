  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HX008 is a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting PD-1 on T cell surface, restores T cell&#xD;
      activity, thus enhancing immune response and has potential to treat various types of tumors.&#xD;
      In this study, the safety and preliminary efficacy of HX008+cisplatin+gemcitabine for the&#xD;
      treatment of patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer will be evaluated.&#xD;
