      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. In patients with less than 4 high risk factors for reintubation excluding body mass&#xD;
           index &gt;30 and hypercapnia during the spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) (low and&#xD;
           intermediate risk for extubation failure), who receive preventive therapy with high flow&#xD;
           nasal cannula (HFNC), the use of SBT with &quot;HIGH minimal ventilator settings&quot; (PS 8 +&#xD;
           PEEP 5 cm H2O Vs PS 5 + PEEP 0 cm H2O), increase the proportion of patients with simple&#xD;
           weaning (extubation after the first SBT).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. In patients with low and intermediate risk for extubation failure, who receive&#xD;
           preventive therapy with HFNC, the use of Walsh screening criteria reduces the mechanical&#xD;
           ventilation time compared with the use of Boles criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: This is a multicenter randomized open trial with 4 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Screening with PaO2/FiO2 &gt; 180 and PEEP ≤ 10cm H2O; SBT with &quot;HIGH minimal ventilator&#xD;
           settings&quot; (PS 8 + PEEP 5 cm H2O).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Screening with PaO2/FiO2 &gt; 180 and PEEP ≤ 10 cm H2O; SBT with &quot;LOW minimal ventilator&#xD;
           settings&quot; (PS 5 + PEEP 0 cm H2O).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Screening with PaO2/FiO2 ≥ 150 and PEEP ≤ 8 cm H2O; SBT with &quot;HIGH minimal ventilator&#xD;
           settings&quot; (PS 8 + PEEP 5 cm H2O).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Screening with PaO2/FiO2 ≥ 150 and PEEP ≤ 8 cm H2O; SBT with &quot;LOW minimal ventilator&#xD;
           settings&quot; (PS 5 + PEEP 0 cm H2O).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome Measure:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. - Percentage of first spontaneous breathing trial tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. - Time on mechanical ventilation.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Discontinuation of mechanical ventilation is a three-step process including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. - Readiness testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
           It evaluates the criteria to determine whether a patient might be able to be&#xD;
           successfully and safety weaned from mechanical ventilation. The detection of readiness&#xD;
           to try a spontaneous breathing test has controversial questions, in special concerning&#xD;
           to oxygenation. From a conservative to an aggressive criteria we can list:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. PaO2/FiO2 &gt; 200 on PEEP ≤ 5 cm H2O (Esteban et al, 1999).&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. PaO2/FiO2 ≥ 150 on PEEP ≤ 8 cm H2O (Boles et al, 2007).&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. PaO2/FiO2 &gt; 180 on PEEP ≤ 10 cm H2O (Walsh et al, 2004). We will compare Walsh and&#xD;
                Boles in their different considerations for oxygenation criteria. Since Walsh&#xD;
                criteria require a higher level of PEEP we understand that this criteria is more&#xD;
                aggressive and in this way it allow to an early detection of readiness to SBT, but&#xD;
                there is not any evidence of this statement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. - Spontaneous breathing trial (SBT). It tries to simulate (but not only) post-extubation&#xD;
           work of breathing to promptly determine the time to extubation. There is also disparity&#xD;
           about SBT minimal ventilator settings:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Inspiratory pressure with a range between automatic tube compensation (ATC) and&#xD;
                inspiratory pressure of 5 - 8 cm H2O. Theoretically, if we use a higher support&#xD;
                pressure during SBT it would be easier to pass the test. One could think that this&#xD;
                may rise the risk of reintubation but there are various trials that have not&#xD;
                confirmed this assumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Guidelines does not make any recommendation about expiratory pressurization,&#xD;
                although the trials conducted use levels of Positive End-Expiratory Pressure&#xD;
                (PEEP), between 0 and 5 cm H2O.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Furthermore, we consider that &quot;minimal ventilator settings&quot; must be adjusted to&#xD;
                additional parameters not previously considered, like preventive therapy applied&#xD;
                after the extubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. All spontaneous breathing trials will last 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. - Extubation follow-up care. Therapies targeted to prevent post-extubation respiratory&#xD;
           failure like high flow nasal cannula (HFNC), noninvasive ventilation (NIV) and&#xD;
           respiratory physiotherapy for improving airway clearance, have been proposed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The variability of preventive therapies and its settings generate different &quot;minimal&#xD;
      ventilator settings&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In view of all that has been set out above, there are two essential points that has not been&#xD;
      analyzed as far we understand:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The different screening criteria available have not been compared with each other about&#xD;
           allowing early detection of readiness, even less with the individual risk of&#xD;
           postextubation failure and still less with the preventive therapy that would be applied&#xD;
           for each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The different inspiratory support pressure as well as PEEP level, have not been compared&#xD;
           with other different values, even less with the individual risk of postextubation&#xD;
           failure and still less with the preventive therapy that would be applied for each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The detailed weaning criteria include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Adequate cough reflex and good clearance of respiratory secretions.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Resolution or stabilization of the initial reason for intubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patient awake with RASS between +1 and -2 according the Richmond Assessment&#xD;
                Sedation Scale (RASS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cardiovascular stability with minimal or no need of vasopressors (HR ≤ 140 lpm,&#xD;
                blood systolic pressure between 90-160 mmHg with minimal or no need of vasopressors&#xD;
                and without increase in the last 24 hours).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Successful oxygenation defined by SpO2 &gt;90% on FiO2 ≤ 40% or PaO2/FiO2&#xD;
&#xD;
                ≥150 with PEEP up to ≤8 cmH2O (Boles et al, 2007) or PaO2/FiO2 &gt;180 con PEEP ≤10 cm&#xD;
                H2O (Walsh et al, 2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Respiratory rate ≤35 bpm without respiratory acidosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Hemoglobin &gt;7g/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Temperature between 36-38,5ºC.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Blood potassium between 3-5 mmol/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Blood sodium between 128-150 mmol/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detailed definition of high risk factors for extubation failure: age older than 65 years;&#xD;
      heart failure as the primary indication for mechanical ventilation; moderate to severe&#xD;
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; an Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II&#xD;
      (APACHE II) score higher than 12 on extubation day; body mass index of more than 30&#xD;
      (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared); airway patency&#xD;
      problems, including high risk of developing laryngeal edema; inability to deal with&#xD;
      respiratory secretions (inadequate cough reflex or suctioning &gt;2 times within 8 hours before&#xD;
      extubation); difficult or prolonged weaning, in brief, a patient failing the first attempt at&#xD;
      disconnection from mechanical ventilation; 2 or more comorbidities defined with Charlson&#xD;
      score; and mechanical ventilation for more than 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The detailed risk categories are the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Low risk: Patients without risk factors who benefit from HFNC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intermediate risk: Patients with 1 to 3 risk factors excluding obese (BMI &gt;30 Kg/m2) and&#xD;
           those who develop hypercapnia during the SBT, that can benefit from HFNC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  High risk: Obese (BMI &gt;30 Kg/m2) and patients with 4 or more risk factors including&#xD;
           hypercapnia during the SBT. This group may benefit from prevention with NIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size estimation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Basal parameters in low risk patients treated with post-extubation HFNC: estimated 30%&#xD;
           of the entire population. Reintubation rate 4.9% and 1(1-3) days on mechanical&#xD;
           ventilation. Estimated reduction in the intervention group: 1 day in the 25% of the&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Basal parameters in intermediate risk patients treated with HFNC: estimated 70% of the&#xD;
           entire population. Reintubation rate 12.24% and 4 (2 - 9) days on mechanical&#xD;
           ventilation. Estimated reduction 1 day in the 33% of the patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calculated standard deviation 3.5 days. CI 95% and power 80%, loss rate 10%, and one-tail&#xD;
      analysis: 260 patients per group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simple randomization immediately after finishing the spontaneous breathing trial. An&#xD;
      intention to treat analysis will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detailed HFNC treatment: High-flow oxygen (Optiflow, Fisher and Paykel Healthcare) will be&#xD;
      applied immediately after extubation through specific nasal cannula. Flow will be initially&#xD;
      set at 10 L/min and titrated upwards in 5-L/min steps until patients experience discomfort.&#xD;
      Temperature will be initially set to 37°C, unless reported too hot by patients, and FIO2 will&#xD;
      be regularly adjusted to the target peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SPO2) of greater&#xD;
      than 92%. After 48 hours, high-flow will be stopped and, if necessary, patients will receive&#xD;
      conventional oxygen therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for spontaneous breathing trial failure are: agitation, anxiety, depressed mental&#xD;
      status, diaphoresis, cyanosis, evidence of increasing respiratory effort, increased accessory&#xD;
      muscle activity, facial signs of distress, dyspnea, PaO2 lower than 60 mmHg or SpO2 lower&#xD;
      than 90% on inspired fraction of oxygen higher than .5, PaCO2 higher than 50 mmHg or&#xD;
      increased more than 8 mmHg from baseline value, arterial pH lower than 7.32 or decreased more&#xD;
      than .07 from baseline value, respiratory rate higher than 35 breaths per minute or increased&#xD;
      more than 50% from baseline value, heart rate higher than 140 beats per minute or increased&#xD;
      more than 20% from baseline value, systolic arterial pressure higher than 180 mmHg or&#xD;
      increased more than 20% from baseline value, systolic arterial pressure lower than 90 mmHg,&#xD;
      or cardiac arrhythmias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who tolerate the spontaneous breathing trial will be reconnected with the previous&#xD;
      ventilator settings for rest and clinical evaluation of airway patency, respiratory&#xD;
      secretions, and upper airway obstruction before extubation.&#xD;
