  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the electronic Framingham Heart Study (eFHS), the investigators developed and deployed a&#xD;
      mobile app to collect cardiovascular risk factors and event data and test them against&#xD;
      cardiovascular data collected in the Framingham research clinic for the FHS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants enrolled in eFHS receive a series of digital surveys modules to complete on a&#xD;
      regularly occurring schedule. The objective of the planned randomized trial is to test the&#xD;
      effect of administering half of survey modules every 2 weeks versus all survey modules every&#xD;
      4 weeks on improving participants' response rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be 4 survey periods. Period 1 encompasses all survey modules administered from&#xD;
      baseline up to week 8 (19 surveys/tasks per participant); period 2 from week 8 up to week 16&#xD;
      (18 surveys/tasks per participant); period 3 from week 16 up to week 24; period 4 from week&#xD;
      24 (16 surveys/tasks per participant).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants in eFHS are invited to enroll from the FHS Offspring and Omni Group 1 Cohorts&#xD;
      during the in-person examination 10/5 at the FHS Research Center in Framingham, Massachusetts&#xD;
      (MA), USA or remotely from home after the in-person examination. All eFHS participants have&#xD;
      the eFHS myDataHelps mobile app (developed by FHS investigators with CareEvolution our&#xD;
      industry partner) installed on their smartphone. The eFHS app allows communication with&#xD;
      participants through notifications and data collection. Participants are asked to answer&#xD;
      health surveys administered through the app.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survey assessments will include 6 modules: cognition, pain, mood, physical function and&#xD;
      performance, physical activity, and events. The interventions are defined by the patterns of&#xD;
      administration of survey modules to the experimental and control groups. The administration&#xD;
      of the cognition, pain, mood, and psychosocial modules follow the same pattern for both&#xD;
      groups. However, the administration of the physical function, physical activity, and events&#xD;
      modules is delayed by 2 weeks in the experimental group as compared to the control group.&#xD;
