  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-center observational study, led by the Department of Geriatrics, Peking&#xD;
      Union Medical College Hospital, with 99 tertiary hospitals as sub-centers. Patients in the&#xD;
      geriatrics department from September 2020 to September 2021 are consecutively enrolled .Basic&#xD;
      information and nutritional risk assessment is registered and the outcome within 90 days&#xD;
      after hospitalization will be recorded.Daily energy, protein and fiber are 75% of the target&#xD;
      amount as the standard for feeding.&#xD;

      This study is a multi-center observational study.Patients in the geriatrics department from&#xD;
      September 2020 to September 2021 are consecutively enrolled .The patients' basic information,&#xD;
      nutritional assessment, diet and blood biochemical indicators after hospitalization will be&#xD;
      registered.The status of nutritional treatment and rehabilitation training and whether there&#xD;
      is any adverse outcome when discharged from the hospital will be recorded. Daily energy,&#xD;
      protein and fiber are 75% of the target amount as the standard for feeding.The diet, exercise&#xD;
      status and adverse outcomes of participants within 90 days after hospitalization will be&#xD;
      followed up through outpatient, telephone or remote consultation.Primary endpoint-the impact&#xD;
      of nutritional therapy (energy, protein, dietary fiber compliance or failure) on mortality,&#xD;
      new infections, falls and readmissions in elderly hospitalized patients within 90 days after&#xD;
      hospitalization; secondary endpoints-the change of the nutrition indicators, the physical&#xD;
      function and quality of life of the participants within 90 days after hospitalization.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Within 90 days after hospitalization</time_frame>
    <description>The Katz scale goes by the basics to evaluate a patient's level of independence or dependence.The 90-day follow-up and baseline ADL scores will be evaluated by trained elderly doctors, and the changes are used as the evaluation indicators for functional changes</description>

    <description>the change of the score of the EQ-5D assessed by the participants.EQ-5D, EuroQol Five Dimensions Questionnaire, is a set of standardized scales for measuring health status. EQ-5D was developed by the European Society for Quality of Life (EuroQol), which can provide a simple and universal health measurement method. In the description part, five dimensions will be used to describe the health status. The five dimensions are: Mobility, Self-care, Usual Activities, Pain/Discomfort ), Anxiety/Depression. The questionnaire requires respondents to choose the most suitable option in each dimension according to their health status.</description>
