      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NIH and the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) conducted a Diet and Health&#xD;
      Study. It studied the links between diet, cancer, and cause of death in a group of&#xD;
      middle-aged people in the U.S. Researchers want to learn more about how diet and lifestyle&#xD;
      can affect cancer and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To clarify links between diet, lifestyle, cancer, death, and chronic diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      AARP members ages 50 to 71 who took part in study #OH95CN025 and lived in California,&#xD;
      Florida, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, North Carolina, Louisiana, Atlanta, or Detroit in 1995&#xD;
      1996.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will use existing data and samples. Participants will not be contacted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants personal data, like name, date of birth, and address, will be used. This data&#xD;
      will be kept private. Their data and samples will get a unique ID.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from other follow-up studies will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cancer outcome data will be obtained from the 8 sample areas. Many participants have moved to&#xD;
      Arizona, Nevada, and Texas. Data will be obtained from those states as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cause of death and date of death will be obtained from the National Death Index.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cheek swab samples were gathered from 2004 to 2005. They will be used to study the oral&#xD;
      microbiome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The University of Washington (UW) will be added as a study site. UW will study air pollution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The process of linking with the Virtual Pooled Registry Cancer Linkage System will be&#xD;
      explored. It uses one system. Right now, 11 state systems are used to get and link data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paper records will be stored in locked file rooms. Electronic data will be stored on secure&#xD;
      servers.&#xD;

      Study Description&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to analyze the data that have been collected as part of NIH-AARP&#xD;
      study (OH95CN025), a historical cohort; in this study we seek to continue to conduct&#xD;
      research, but no new study activities will be requested from the study participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      To examine relationships between diet, lifestyle, and cancers by means of a prospective&#xD;
      cohort design&#xD;

      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data and samples from 566,398 members of the AARP (formally the American Association of&#xD;
      Retired Persons), aged 50-71 years, and who resided in one of six states (California,&#xD;
      Florida, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, North Carolina, and Louisiana) or in two metropolitan&#xD;
      areas (Atlanta, Georgia and Detroit, Michigan) in 1995-1996&#xD;
