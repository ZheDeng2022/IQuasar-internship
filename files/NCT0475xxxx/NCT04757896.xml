      To evaluate the success of surgical anesthesia of lateral and medial approaches of the&#xD;
      costoclavicular block in patients undergoing upper extremity surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Introduction:Upper limb surgeries are used on various pathology cases including tendon&#xD;
      injuries, carpal tunnel syndrome, tenosynovitis, fractures secondary to trauma, contractures&#xD;
      and vascular injuries. In many of such operations local anaesthesia becomes insufficient, and&#xD;
      general or regional anaesthesia is required for comfort of the patient and the surgeon.&#xD;
      Today, widespread use of nerve stimulators and ultrasound, the availability of post-operative&#xD;
      pain management options, applicability of regional anaesthesia where there is risk of&#xD;
      complications with general anaesthesia and its applicability along with general anaesthesia&#xD;
      for pain management has made regional anaesthesia an attractive solution.The costoclavicular&#xD;
      cavity lies in the depth and back of the median of clavicular. It connects to subclavius and&#xD;
      clavicular terminus of pectoralis major muscle at the anterior and to the anterior chest wall&#xD;
      at the posterior. The cavity is cranially continuous with the supraclavicular fossa and&#xD;
      caudally continuous with the medial infraclavicular fossa above the upper border of the&#xD;
      pectoralis minor muscle. Unlike the lateral infraclavicular fossa, the cords lie in the&#xD;
      costoclavicular cavity in a relatively superficial form in a bundled triangular arrangement.&#xD;
      Anatomical layout of cords in the costoclavicular cavity makes this an attractive area for&#xD;
      ultrasound imaging and infraclavicular brachial plexus blockage. After placing the linear&#xD;
      ultrasound probe on the midclavicular line and even in parallel to the clavicular, the three&#xD;
      cords are imaged along with the axillary artery, whereupon local anaesthetic injection can be&#xD;
      made with in-plane technique, directing the needle from lateral to medial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medial approach to costoclavicular block defined by Nieuwveld involves placement of the&#xD;
      linear ultrasound probe on the midclavicular line in parallel with the clavicular, as in the&#xD;
      lateral approach, followed by imaging of the three cords alongside the axillary artery,&#xD;
      whereupon the needle is directed from the medial to the lateral with the in-plane technique&#xD;
      and applying local anaesthetic injection to the midpoint of three cords.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size calculation is done based on the time for establishing total anaesthesia and&#xD;
      anaesthesia lead time variables in reference to the study conducted by Prangmalee&#xD;
      Leurcharusmee et al. Calculating for 16±5 for lateral approach and 21±7 for medial approach,&#xD;
      it is calculated that each group should include 44 patients at 80% power and 95% reliability&#xD;
      rate for a meaningful difference at 5 minutes, requiring a total of 88 patients.After&#xD;
      obtaining approval of the local ethics board, 88 patients who are considered for emergency or&#xD;
      elective superior extremity surgery, in ASA I-IV group, in 18 to 75 age group, who do not&#xD;
      have any known serious illness and who consent to participate will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and Method:Patients in ASA IV group and above, patients taking&#xD;
      anticoagulant/antiaggregate treatments, patients with nervous disorders, patients with&#xD;
      infections or open wounds at the operation area and patients with allergies against any drug&#xD;
      to be used in the study will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients participating in the study will be randomly divided into 2 separate groups. These&#xD;
      groups will be referred to as the Group M (Medial approach group) and Group L (Lateral&#xD;
      approach group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be reviewed before being taken to operating room, they will be informed&#xD;
      regarding the considered operation and their consent will be taken. Patients will be moved to&#xD;
      regional anaesthesia room before the operation, where they will be equipped with fingertip&#xD;
      oxygen saturation monitoring and 20-22 gauge intravenous channel. After confirming operation&#xD;
      area sterilisation will be done with skin antiseptic, the operation area will be covered with&#xD;
      sterilised cover and linear USG probe will be prepared in sterile conditions. All procedures&#xD;
      will be implemented by an experienced anaesthesiologist. A blind researcher will review the&#xD;
      patients and the surgical team will also be kept blind regarding the type of procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Group M, after the patient will be taken to the regional anaesthesia room and preparations&#xD;
      will be made, the blockage procedure will be applied by an anaesthesiologist who is not&#xD;
      blind. The patient will be brought to supine position, the arm subject to procedure will be&#xD;
      taken to 90° abduction with the palm looking at the ceiling. The Linear USG probe will be&#xD;
      positioned on the midclavicular line and the chronometer will be started to record the&#xD;
      scanning procedure time as the time elapsed until imaging of the axillary artery alongside&#xD;
      with the three cords. After achieving optimum imaging skin infiltration will be applied with&#xD;
      1% lidocaine and an 80-100 mm needle will be directed from the medial to the lateral with the&#xD;
      in-plane technique and the blockage procedure will be completed by injecting a combination of&#xD;
      10 cc 2% lidocaine and 10 cc 0.5% bupivacaine in the exact midpoint of the three cords.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Group L, again the patient will be taken to the regional anaesthesia room and preparations&#xD;
      will be made, and the blockage procedure will be applied by an anaesthesiologist who is not&#xD;
      blind. The patient will be brought to supine position, the arm subject to procedure will be&#xD;
      taken to 90° abduction with the palm looking at the ceiling. The Linear USG probe will be&#xD;
      positioned on the midclavicular line and the chronometer will be started to record the&#xD;
      scanning procedure time as the time elapsed until imaging of the axillary artery alongside&#xD;
      with the three cords. After achieving optimum imaging skin infiltration will be applied with&#xD;
      1% lidocaine and an 80-100 mm needle will be directed from the medial to the lateral with the&#xD;
      in-plane technique and the blockage procedure will be completed by injecting a combination of&#xD;
      10 cc 2% lidocaine and 10 cc 0.5% bupivacaine in the exact midpoint of the three cords.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total procedure time, the complications arising during procedure, the local anaesthetic&#xD;
      toxicity, the paraesthesia arising during the procedure, the distance between the needle tip&#xD;
      and the pleura and the number of needle passes will be recorded for each procedure. A blind&#xD;
      researcher will evaluate sensory blockage by checking radial, musculocutaneous, medial and&#xD;
      ulnar nerve dermatomes with ice using triple point scale (0= no blockage, patient completely&#xD;
      feels the cold; 1= analgesia, the patient does not feel the cold but feels the touch; 2=&#xD;
      anaesthesia, the patient does not feel the touch) once per 5 minutes for 30/45 minutes taking&#xD;
      the moment of needle removal as the 0 point. Motor block will also be evaluated by triple&#xD;
      point scale (0=no blockage; 1=paraesthesia established; 2=paralysis established) once per 5&#xD;
      minutes for 30 minutes. Motor blockage at musculocutaneous, radial, median and ulnar nerves&#xD;
      will be evaluated by elbow flexion, thumb abduction, thumb opposition and thumb adduction, in&#xD;
      this order. Sensory and motor blockage starting time points and total anaesthesia&#xD;
      establishment time points will be recorded. At 20/30 minutes point convex (M mode) USG probe&#xD;
      will be used to evaluate diaphragmatic paralysis. Once surgical anaesthesia is established&#xD;
      the operation will be started, the patient will be monitored throughout the operation,&#xD;
      additional analgesia-sedation needs, returns to general anaesthesia and total surgery times&#xD;
      will be recorded. After surgical operation is completed, patient and surgeon satisfaction&#xD;
      will be questioned.&#xD;
