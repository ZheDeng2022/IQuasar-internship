  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It was to compare the effect of low-load resistance training with blood flow restriction&#xD;
      (LL-BFR) and high-intensity resistance training (HI-RT) on muscle strength, endurance and&#xD;
      volume, functional performance, and delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study included 13 young women. It is a controlled study designed for individuals to&#xD;
      perform two different exercise protocols unilaterally. The persons were randomly allocated&#xD;
      into two groups as LI- BFR (Group I, n = 13) and HI-RT (Group II, n = 13). Both groups&#xD;
      received training for 6 weeks and 3 days a week. Blood flow restriction was performed only in&#xD;
      group I.&#xD;

      Both sides triceps muscle thickness, triceps and biceps strength and endurance, functional&#xD;
      performances (upper extremity Y balance test (UQYBT)), delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS)&#xD;
      were evaluated before and after training.&#xD;
