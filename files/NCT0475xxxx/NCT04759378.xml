  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the practice of a gastroenterologist, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most frequent&#xD;
      functional disorder. Its prevalence in the population is 9.8%-12.8%. Its frequency in women&#xD;
      is more than men. In some studies, it has been shown that a patient may have an overlap of&#xD;
      symptoms of different functional diseases of the gastrointestinal tract. Different&#xD;
      researchers have ambiguously assessed the frequency of occurrence of esophageal disorders in&#xD;
      patients with IBS. So, based on the publications of different authors, they are found in&#xD;
      15-80% of cases. In a study by N. de Bortoli et al. (2016) noted the association of IBS with&#xD;
      functional heartburn in 77% of cases, and with GERD and hypersensitive esophagus (called&#xD;
      heartburn associated with reflux) - in 33% of cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditionally, diagnostics of a combination of functional disorders of the esophagus and&#xD;
      intestines were based on data X-ray and endoscopic methods. However modern research has shown&#xD;
      the importance of using in this group of patients with daily combined pH impedance&#xD;
      measurement. Thus, many authors have noted the undoubted advantages of this method in the&#xD;
      diagnosis of esophageal disorders. Unfortunately, works devoted to this topic, extremely few&#xD;
      in number, and the information obtained in them is quite contradictory, which indicates the&#xD;
      need to continue research in this direction.&#xD;
