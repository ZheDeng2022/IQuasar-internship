  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nonbacterial prostatitis refers to a condition that affects patients who present with&#xD;
      symptoms of prostatitis without a positive culture for urine or expressed prostate secretions&#xD;
      (EPS). With time our understanding of prostatitis was evolved to include a different clinical&#xD;
      phenotype with a variety of voiding presentation and symptomatology rather than just&#xD;
      inflammation and infection. The two main clinical presentations of prostatitis include pelvic&#xD;
      pain and LUTS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The National Institutes of Health and the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and&#xD;
      Kidney Diseases (NIH-NIDDK) proposed the first classification of prostatitis into 4&#xD;
      categories in 1995 that was later published in 1998. Bacterial prostatitis represented&#xD;
      category I and III while nonbacterial prostatitis including chronic prostatitis/chronic&#xD;
      pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) was categorized as category III that was further subdivided&#xD;
      into class IIIa (inflammatory CPPS) and b (non-inflammatory CPPS). Category IV encompasses&#xD;
      asymptomatic inflammatory prostatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Shoskes et al, mentioned that inflammation and the upregulation of cytokine expression and&#xD;
      release in the prostate secondary to an inflammatory process led to the presenting symptoms&#xD;
      in such a condition. The recently introduced UPOINT phenotype categorization of CP/CPPS&#xD;
      (Urinary, Psychosocial, Organ-specific, Infection, Neurological/Systemic, Tenderness of the&#xD;
      skeletal muscles). This categorization shows up to 60% of men have at least prostate organ&#xD;
      associated symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prostate lies under the hormonal control of dihydrotestosterone (DHT); thus 5&#xD;
      alpha-reductase inhibitors (5ARIs) might be beneficial in the treatment of prostatitis.&#xD;
      Dutasteride is a 5α-reductase inhibitor, and hence is a type of anti-androgen. It works by&#xD;
      decreasing the production of (DHT) in certain parts of the body like the prostate gland. It&#xD;
      inhibits all three forms of 5α-reductase and can decrease DHT levels in the blood by up to&#xD;
      98%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5ARIs have been previously evaluated on a narrow scale in the management of prostatitis with&#xD;
      promising results of safety and efficacy.&#xD;
