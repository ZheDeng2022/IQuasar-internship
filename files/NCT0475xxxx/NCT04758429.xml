  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a multi-center, prospective, non-randomized, observational study to collect data&#xD;
      to develop and validate a machine learning algorithm for early detection of worsening heart&#xD;
      failure events using multi-parametric sensor data from wearable data capture device The VESTA&#xD;
      study will enroll up to 552 subjects in up to 25 centers in order to collect data on a total&#xD;
      of at least 56 worsening heart failure events (independently adjudicated hospitalizations or&#xD;
      unscheduled intravenous administration of decongestive drugs).The duration of follow-up per&#xD;
      participant will be between 3-6 months.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is an international, multicenter, prospective, open-label, non-randomized single&#xD;
      group study, with no control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has 2 phases: the first phase is to train and develop the automated learning&#xD;
      algorithm; the second phase is to validate the algorithm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be assigned into two cohorts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Cohort 1 will provide the data to be used for algorithm development and training.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Cohort 2 will provide data to be used for algorithm validation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been estimated that approximately 276 subjects are required for each cohort in order&#xD;
      to accumulate the minimum number of cases for the study's primary objective. Sequential&#xD;
      enrolment will be implemented by regional blocks according to an estimation of the regional&#xD;
      distribution of subjects.The sample size and regional distribution of subjects are estimates&#xD;
      and the study is endpoint driven to achieve at least 28 WHF events with corresponding&#xD;
      analyzable device data. Fewer subjects may be enrolled should the required number of events&#xD;
      be acquired at a faster rate than calculated and the regional proportions of subjects may&#xD;
      vary according to regional enrollment rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will undergo the same study procedures, irrespective of their cohort&#xD;
      assignment. Each subject will receive the study device kit (garment and smart phone with&#xD;
      charger) at enrollment and will be followed up for up to 6 months, or until at least 28&#xD;
      worsening heart failure (WHF) events per cohort have been acquired. Even if the required&#xD;
      number of events have been acquired, all participants will be followed up for a minimum of at&#xD;
      least 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will collect data; however no data collected by the device will be made available&#xD;
      to clinical care personnel during the study and as such no medical action will be taken based&#xD;
      on the device. Medical follow-up will be according to standard practice as per each&#xD;
      investigational site, which will be documented AND there will be no additional medical&#xD;
      intervention on the study participants. The participants are required to agree to be&#xD;
      compliant with the use of the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no masking of device allocation or procedures. However, the clinical investigators,&#xD;
      treating physicians and the independent clinical events adjudication committee (IEAC) members&#xD;
      will be blinded to all sensor data throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators developing the algorithm will have no access to the validation cohort&#xD;
      database before the parameters of the algorithm have been fixed by the training cohort.&#xD;
