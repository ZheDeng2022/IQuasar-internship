  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of conducting a randomised&#xD;
      controlled trial (RCT) comparing brief psychological intervention to help patients with&#xD;
      Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD), reduce cardiovascular risk factors compared to&#xD;
      control/treatment as usual in a vascular outpatient clinic. Trial feasibility was defined as&#xD;
      the successful recruitment and retention of participants, adherence to the intervention,&#xD;
      identification of barriers to the intervention and collection of clinical and quality of life&#xD;
      outcome data. Qualitative data was collected to evaluate participant experience and the&#xD;
      clinical impact of a supported self-management intervention delivered in a routine clinical&#xD;
      setting.&#xD;

      The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of conducting a definitive multi-centre&#xD;
      trial of a specially designed health behaviour change intervention delivered in a secondary&#xD;
      care outpatient clinic to improve the primary clinical outcome of functional walking ability&#xD;
      This feasibility study, based on the MRC framework for assessing feasibility and piloting&#xD;
      methods, will assess the relative strengths and weaknesses of the intervention and study&#xD;
      design, as well as pave the way for a larger and more definitive trial.&#xD;
