      The main purpose of this study is to conduct a Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) where we&#xD;
      evaluate an internet administrated version of Emotional Awareness and Expression Therapy&#xD;
      (I-EAET) in the treatment of Somatic Symptom Disorder (SSD). We will include 160 patients&#xD;
      with SSD that will be randomized to taking part of the Internet based treatment for ten weeks&#xD;
      (80 patients) or a waiting list control condition (80 patients). A between-subject design&#xD;
      will be used. Self-report measures of symptom level and mechanisms of change will be&#xD;
      conducted weekly for the primary outcome measures (PHQ-15, BPI-4) and the process measure&#xD;
      (EPS-25). The other self-report measures will be conducted before, after treatment and at&#xD;
      follow up at 4-month and 12.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Research background Somatic Symptom Disorder (SSD; DSM-5) is one of the most prevalent&#xD;
      disorders encountered in primary care settings (1). Typically in SSD, distressing somatic&#xD;
      complaints are accompanied by abnormal thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, emphasizing the&#xD;
      role of psychological factors. The experience of somatic symptoms is commonly associated with&#xD;
      high levels of impairment in quality of life, psychological distress or increased healthcare&#xD;
      utilization (2). In addition, SSD has been associated with an elevated risk for chronic&#xD;
      manifestation and comorbid mental disorders, work loss or early retirement (3). Although&#xD;
      cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is the best evidenced psychological treatment for SSD,&#xD;
      effect sizes are rather moderate or even small (4). Therefore the question of how to develop&#xD;
      more effective treatment protocols for SSD arises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Difficulties in emotional processing and expression have been demonstrated with patients with&#xD;
      SSD in several studies (5). Importantly though, there are indications that an emotion focus&#xD;
      in treatment increases the possibility of symptom reduction for patients with SSD (6). In&#xD;
      addition, many patients with SSD have experienced stressful/traumatic life events (7). Hence,&#xD;
      another potential reason for the limited effect of CBT for SSD may be that these traumas have&#xD;
      not been adequately addressed in treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emotional Awareness and Expression Therapy (EAET) is an affect-focused psychodynamic form of&#xD;
      psychotherapy, that has an explicit focus on emotional processing and resolving attachment&#xD;
      trauma (8). There is a promising research support for EAET for treating SSD related&#xD;
      disorders, where it has been shown to be more effective than CBT in two randomized controlled&#xD;
      trials where fibromyalgia and chronic musculoskeletal pain were targeted, respectively&#xD;
      (9,10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many of today's models of psychotherapy has been tested as guided self-help via the Internet&#xD;
      (11). This is a cost-effective, scalable form of psychotherapy delivery. While there exists&#xD;
      promising evidence that Internet-based affect-focused psychodynamic therapy is effective in&#xD;
      the treatment of depression and anxiety disorders (12,13), there are no published studies on&#xD;
      EAET in the format of guided self-help delivered via the Internet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary results from a pilot study on Internet-based EAET However, our own group very&#xD;
      recently completed a (yet unpublished) pilot trial of Internet based EAET (I-EAET), with an&#xD;
      explicit focus on emotional processing using expressive writing. The project was approved by&#xD;
      the Swedish Ethical Review Authority (Dnr 2019-03317). We included 52 patients with SSD who&#xD;
      took part of a nine-week program based on EAET. Details of the I-EAET intervention are&#xD;
      described in the Methods sections below. A large within-group reduction in somatic symptoms&#xD;
      (PHQ-15) was observed (Cohen's d = 1.12; 95% CI: 0.77-1.46). Small to moderate magnitude&#xD;
      reductions in anxiety (GAD-7), depression (PHQ-9), trauma related symptoms (PCL-5), and&#xD;
      dysfunctional emotional processing (EPS25) occurred. Almost one-quarter of the sample (23.1%)&#xD;
      achieved a 50% or greater reduction in somatic symptoms. The treatment also significantly&#xD;
      increased patient's ability to take part in social and family life (Sheehan Disability&#xD;
      Scale). The results were maintained at a four month follow-up. While the results are to be&#xD;
      interpreted carefully, the effects seem promising. Further research studies on I-EAET using&#xD;
      randomized controlled trials are warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research proposal is about testing the effects of I-EAET in the treatment of SSD,&#xD;
      compared to a waiting-list control condition, using a randomized controlled trial. The long&#xD;
      term goal is to develop an intervention that can increase treatment optimization in SSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research questions&#xD;
&#xD;
      a) Can Internet-delivered EAET with an explicit focus on expressive writing decrease bodily&#xD;
      symptoms and pain, depression, anxiety and insomnia symptoms, among patients with SSD, as&#xD;
      compared to a control condition? b) Is symptom reduction throughout treatment of SSD&#xD;
      associated with an increase in emotional processing? c) Are the effects maintained at a&#xD;
      4-month- and 12-month follow-up?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods The I-EAET intervention was developed as part of the pilot trial, conducted during&#xD;
      late 2019. It is primarily based on Howard Schubiner's book &quot;Unlearn your pain&quot; (14). The&#xD;
      I-EAET intervention includes 1) a psychoeducational component on the brain and the nervous&#xD;
      system, 2) self-compassion training using meditation techniques, 3) awareness practice on the&#xD;
      relationship between trauma, emotions and bodily symptoms, 4) emotional processing using&#xD;
      expressive writing exercises, and 5) adaptive interpersonal communication in situations that&#xD;
      might trigger pain symptoms. The treatment will last 10 weeks. A secure web-platform (the KI&#xD;
      e-Health Core Facility) will be used to provide the treatment via the Internet. Every week&#xD;
      the participant in the treatment reads a text consisting of 10-20 pages. The text specifies&#xD;
      the theme for the week (i.e. self-compassion) and the home-work assignments to be conducted&#xD;
      during the week. Typically, the participants do a daily meditation exercise for 10-15 minutes&#xD;
      and an expressive writing assignment for 15-30 minutes. In the daily meditation exercises the&#xD;
      participant learn to observe self-critical thoughts and to notice that these thoughts&#xD;
      sometimes is anger turned at oneself. Using these meditation exercises, the participants&#xD;
      learns to develop a compassionate voice instead of their self-critical one. In the written&#xD;
      assignments, usually a stressful or traumatic life event is targeted where emotions are&#xD;
      processed in a prespecified order. Emotions tied to these situations are often anger, guilt&#xD;
      about anger, sadness and love.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the participants have done the homework for the week, they send it to their designated&#xD;
      psychologist and get written feedback.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized controlled trial of Internet-based EAET for SSD The main purpose of this study is&#xD;
      to conduct a Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) where we evaluate an internet administrated&#xD;
      version of Emotional Awareness and Expression Therapy (I-EAET) in the treatment of Somatic&#xD;
      Symptom Disorder (SSD). We will include 160 patients with SSD that will be randomized to&#xD;
      taking part of the Internet based treatment for ten weeks (80 patients) or a waiting list&#xD;
      control condition (80 patients). A between-subject design will be used. Self-report measures&#xD;
      of symptom level and mechanisms of change will be conducted weekly for the primary outcome&#xD;
      measures (PHQ-15, BPI-4) and the process measure (EPS-25). The other self-report measures&#xD;
      will be conducted before, after treatment and at follow up at 4-month and 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feedback on content, process and potential caveats will be collected using surveys and&#xD;
      written evaluations from the participants at post-treatment. Linear mixed models will be used&#xD;
      to investigate trajectories of change in symptoms and processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time plan January 2021: Recruitment, screening procedure and diagnostic interviews February&#xD;
      2021: Treatment start + Pre-treatment measures conducted April 2021: Treatment ends +&#xD;
      Post-treatment measures conducted September 2021: Four-month follow-up + Treatment offered to&#xD;
      patients on waiting-list April 2022: Twelve-month follow-up measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance An EAET intervention conducted through the Internet, with a strong focus on&#xD;
      emotional processing using expressive writing could potentially increase treatment&#xD;
      optimization in SSD and offer a new potential treatment avenue. Furthermore, although several&#xD;
      theoretical models of SSD exist, the field lacks solid empirical results from treatment&#xD;
      trials, where the analyses of mechanisms of change are conducted using state-of-the-art&#xD;
      methods. Such analyses could help to pinpoint the relation between symptom change and&#xD;
      emotional processing throughout different phases of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations Given that the treatment manual in our studies has not been evaluated&#xD;
      before, special considerations will be given to adverse effects. As weekly symptom measures&#xD;
      will be conducted, we will be able to monitor patients closely for any potential&#xD;
      deterioration that will need to be handled. Medical experts will be available for&#xD;
      consultation throughout the treatment periods. Adverse events of treatment will also be&#xD;
      monitored by using the Negative Effects Questionnaire (NEQ).&#xD;
