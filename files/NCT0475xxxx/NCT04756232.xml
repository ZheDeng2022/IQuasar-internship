      This study will use an anticholinergic pharmacological probe to examine attention network&#xD;
      function in SCD using EEG. The overall hypothesis is that in older adults with SCD, normal&#xD;
      cognitive performance is maintained by compensatory attention network activity, supported by&#xD;
      enhanced cholinergic function. The investigators anticipate that SCD will be associated with&#xD;
      greater compensatory attention network activity and that disrupting this compensatory process&#xD;
      through anticholinergic challenge will result in a greater negative effect on attentional&#xD;
      performance (Attention Network Test, ANT) and attention network functioning (EEG) in older&#xD;
      adults with SCD compared to those without SCD.&#xD;

      Overview: Cognitively normal older adults with and without subjective cognitive decline (SCD)&#xD;
      (n = 20; SCD = 10, Non-SCD = 10) will complete two study visits that will be double blinded&#xD;
      and randomized for anticholinergic challenge (mecamylamine or placebo). Drug challenge visits&#xD;
      will include cognitive testing and an electroencephalography (EEG) session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Feasibility of EEG during mecamylamine challenge&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measures for Aim 1 will be the rate of completion of study visits with&#xD;
      drug challenge and of completion of EEG tasks during the study visits with drug challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Attention Network Test: The attention network test (ANT) is designed to test selective&#xD;
      attention , and combines attentional cues with a flanker task. Behavioral measures of the ANT&#xD;
      will be 1) Alerting: reaction time (RT) non-cue trials - cue trials; 2) Orienting: RT neutral&#xD;
      cue trials - spatial cue trials; 3) Executive: RT incongruent trials - congruent trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EEG, Task-related Event Related Potentials: Each participant will complete the ANT during EEG&#xD;
      with primary event relation potential (ERP) measures: 1) Alerting: early sensory ERP (P1)&#xD;
      amplitude; 2) Orienting: early sensory ERP (P1) amplitude; 3) Executive: target and conflict&#xD;
      evaluation ERP (P3) amplitude. Other ERP signals related to attention and sensory processing&#xD;
      will be examined in exploratory analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Incidental Memory: Incidental Memory Task during EEG, a passive visual memory paradigm that&#xD;
      will allow an exploratory examination of the relationship between SCD and brain activity for&#xD;
      memory recognition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychomotor Speed: The Choice Reaction Time task will be used as a test of psychomotor speed.&#xD;
      This task decomposes overall reaction time into recognition and motor components, allowing&#xD;
      for the assessment of response and motor time that cannot be attained during the ANT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Episodic Memory: The Selective Reminding Task (SRT) is a multi-trial verbal list-learning&#xD;
      task that offers measures of storage into and retrieval from both short term and long term&#xD;
      memory and intrusion errors. Outcome measures will be total recall (8 trials), total recall&#xD;
      failures (8 trials), and delayed recall (20 minutes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration: During challenge drug study visits, participants will receive&#xD;
      double-blinded administration of either 20 mg mecamylamine or placebo. Mecamylamine is a&#xD;
      centrally and peripherally active non-competitive antagonist of acetylcholine at C6&#xD;
      (ganglionic) type nicotinic receptors that has been used to test cholinergic function and&#xD;
      cognitive performance. We have previously achieved cognitive effect without significant&#xD;
      adverse effect using the dose proposed for this study. Randomization and dispensing will be&#xD;
      managed by Vanderbilt Investigational Drug Services. Peak cognitive and physiologic effects&#xD;
      occur by 2-3 hours and dissipate by 4-6 hours after oral administration. Dr. Paul Newhouse&#xD;
      will serve as the physician of record for the mecamylamine challenge procedures; nursing&#xD;
      staff at the Vanderbilt Clinical Research Center will administer the study drug and monitor&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Plan:This project is a pilot study to determine the feasibility and&#xD;
      participant tolerability for conducting EEG during the mecamylamine challenge. The proposed&#xD;
      sample size (n =20) is designed to provide sufficient experience with the protocol to&#xD;
      determine our ability to complete this protocol in a larger study and determine completion&#xD;
      rates for the two participant groups (SCD and Non-SCD) as preliminary data for an NIH K01&#xD;
      application resubmission for Dr. Albert. Dr. Hakmook Kang is the biostatistics consultant for&#xD;
      this project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will be used to identify the rate of completion of study visits with&#xD;
      drug challenge (proportion of participants that complete both study days), and of completion&#xD;
      of EEG tasks (proportion of participants who complete both tasks on each study visits with&#xD;
      drug challenge). These measures will be calculated for all participants (n = 20), and for&#xD;
      participant groups separately (SCD, n = 10; Non-SCD, n = 10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have hypothesized that &gt; 80 % of participants will complete both study&#xD;
      visits with drug challenge based on their experience using mecamylamine with 88% of&#xD;
      participants completing 2 study visits including mecamylamine or placebo administration. The&#xD;
      investigators have hypothesized that &gt; 70 % of participants will complete both EEG tasks (ANT&#xD;
      and incidental memory) during study visits with drug challenge, based on previous completion&#xD;
      rates of 72% for non-EEG tasks during study visits including mecamylamine or placebo&#xD;
      administration, and 100% for EEG tasks with no drug challenge.&#xD;
