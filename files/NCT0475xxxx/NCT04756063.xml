  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A single-center, randomized, double-blinded placebo-controlled trial is proposed to&#xD;
      investigate administration of supraphysiologic doses of ascorbic acid (vitamin C, AA) to&#xD;
      patients undergoing liver transplantation. Participants randomized to the intervention group&#xD;
      will receive intravenous (IV) AA 1500 mg every 6 hours for 48 hours. Participants randomized&#xD;
      to the control group will receive a saline placebo. The primary study outcome will be a&#xD;
      change in the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score from baseline to three days&#xD;
      after the first dose of drug (dSOFA3). Secondary outcomes will include total vasopressor dose&#xD;
      in norepinephrine equivalents, 30-day and 1-year mortality, and serum AA levels.&#xD;

      HYPOTHESIS: Administration of supraphysiologic doses of parenteral AA in the perioperative&#xD;
      period for patients undergoing liver transplantation will improve Sequential Organ Failure&#xD;
      Assessment (SOFA) scores, vasopressor usage and biochemical, cellular and clinical end-organ&#xD;
      damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim: Determine the clinical response to parenteral AA supplementation in patients&#xD;
      undergoing liver transplantation by a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: This study is a prospective, single-center, randomized trial in which 90&#xD;
      participants will be enrolled at the University of Wisconsin Hospitals and Clinics (UWHC).&#xD;
      Participants must meet study eligibility criteria and be scheduled to undergo primary&#xD;
      deceased donor solitary liver transplantation. Participants will be randomized to receive 8&#xD;
      doses of 1500 mg AA IV or volume-equivalent placebo every 6 hours for 48 hours, in addition&#xD;
      to standard medical management.&#xD;

    <description>SOFA scores are a widely used composite measure of multiorgan dysfunction, validated as an accurate predictor of short- and long-term mortality in the general ICU and liver transplant populations. Change in SOFA from baseline (delta SOFA or dSOFA) has been shown to be more predictive of mortality than other derivatives such as absolute interval SOFA scores and has been recommended as the preferred endpoint in critical care settings&#xD;
The total possible range of scores is 0-24, higher scores are indicative of a higher degree of dysfunction.</description>
