  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) represents a problem of great implications to patients with heart&#xD;
      failure (HF). Therefore, the risk of having AF increases up to 4,5 -5,9 times with the&#xD;
      presence of HF. Both conditions share risk factors and the presence of the one worsens the&#xD;
      progress of the other. Therefore, the AF is not only relevant in terms of thromboembolic&#xD;
      events. Timing of AF progression seems to be associated with an increase in all causes of&#xD;
      mortality. Although, it is estimated that between 30%-40% of the patients with HF develop AF,&#xD;
      given that in many cases it occurs with no apparent symptoms for the patients, is considered&#xD;
      that the number of affected patients is greater. Since silent AF poses a problem of great&#xD;
      impact in patients with HF, monitoring through continuous electrocardiographic registry could&#xD;
      be useful in those patients with a higher risk of thromboembolic events. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to understand the mechanism and biological and clinical relevance of the AF from a&#xD;
      holistic approach. Trying to distinguish the symptomatic AF from the silent one using the&#xD;
      implementation of insertable cardiac devices. The purpose of this study is 1. To determine in&#xD;
      which percentage of patients with HF, episodes of AF both symptomatic and asymptomatic occur,&#xD;
      as well as if the presence of AF represents an irrelevant fact in the progression of the&#xD;
      insufficiency or in the contrary, it is the cause of the HF patients clinical decline. 2. To&#xD;
      examine the presence of triggers of AF in patients with HF and to identify the presence of&#xD;
      clinical markers, image markers of the atrium and left ventricle, as well as biomarkers which&#xD;
      allow the risk of stratification and could mean future therapeutic targets.&#xD;

      Multicenter prospective study formed by units with experience in the management of patients&#xD;
      with HF (Hospital Clínico Universitario de Santiago de Compostela, Santiago de Compostela,&#xD;
      Spain; Hospital Clínico Universitario de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain and Hospital&#xD;
      Universitario Virgen de la Arrixaca, Murcia, Spain).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on an AF development estimate of 30%, it has been estimated a minimum follow-up of 18&#xD;
      months and a maximum of 36 months for obtaining robust conclusions. On the basis of&#xD;
      previously reported data, it has been estimated that the annual rate of AF in patients 65&#xD;
      years of age or older who have CHA2DS2VASc ≥ 2 and who have received an ICM is 6%. The&#xD;
      enrolment of 300 patients had been estimated. The study would have 95% power to detect an&#xD;
      episode of rapid atrial rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those patients with a CHA2DS2VASc ≥2 seen in the HF unit will be prospectively included. In&#xD;
      these patients, the previous diagnosis of AF will be assessed by means of clinical history&#xD;
      and medical records. Patients with previous AF will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with preserved or intermediate LVEF will be defined according to current guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with signs and symptoms of HF.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  LVEF between 40 and 49 for &quot;mid-range&quot; and greater than or equal to 50 for those with&#xD;
           LVEF preserved and at least one of these two criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  High natriuretic peptides (BNP&gt; 35 pg / ml and / or NT-proBNP&gt; 125 pg / mL)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Relevant structural disease (left ventricular hypertrophy or dilatation left&#xD;
                earphone).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Diastolic dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be collected individually by each recruiting center and introduced in the&#xD;
      online registration form that will be enabled (see next point). The definition of variables&#xD;
      will be agreed upon among all recruiting centers. The information collected will be dumped&#xD;
      into a database created specifically for this purpose and will be coordinated from the&#xD;
      Hospital Clínico de Santiago de Compostela.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Remote monitoring The CareLink remote monitoring system allows remote monitoring of patients,&#xD;
      without the need to go to the hospital center. This system establishes a connection between&#xD;
      the patient and the medical center, through the patient monitor that reads the information&#xD;
      from the implanted device and transmits it to a secure server. This communication allows the&#xD;
      transmission of clinically significant events or, in the case of wireless devices, the&#xD;
      sending of alerts. In this way, the healthcare professional has information of the event and&#xD;
      allows him to anticipate the evaluation and treatment with the consequent benefit for the&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biological characterization&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human plasma samples: Total venous blood samples (10 ml) will be collected in EDTA tubes as&#xD;
      anticoagulants and separated by centrifugation at 1500xg during 15 minutes plasma and&#xD;
      cellular fractions. The supernatant and the cell pellet are transferred to tubes and stored&#xD;
      at -80°C. The serological samples will be stored in each center of origin. Several&#xD;
      determinations will be performed:&#xD;
