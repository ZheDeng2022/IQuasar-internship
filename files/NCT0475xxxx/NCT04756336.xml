    <textblock>
      An Open label Phase II//proof of concept-study to demonstrate if percutaneous application of&#xD;
      LTX-109 in a gel vehicle is a safe treatment of Hidradenitis suppurativa and to identify&#xD;
      clinical response to intervention, as well to identify if covariates such as age, disease&#xD;
      duration, smoking state and BMI influence patient reported measures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is unclear whether bacterial colonization in hidradenitis suppurativa/acne inversa (HS)&#xD;
      comprises a primary cause, triggering factor or secondary phenomenon of the disease&#xD;
      pathogenesis. Studies imply that aberrant immune responses play a role involving both the&#xD;
      innate and adaptive immune system, however the clinical picture of HS lesions appears&#xD;
      reminiscent of bacterial infection, e.g. due to intense inflammation and malodorous&#xD;
      discharge. Recent microbiological studies indicate certain bacterial species are associated&#xD;
      with mature HS lesions. It is demonstrated a significant high occurrence of large bacterial&#xD;
      biofilms (aggregates &gt; 50 Î¼m in diameter) in tunnels. In total, an array of studies point to&#xD;
      a potential involvement of a specific microbiota in the pathogenesis of HS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The antimicrobial effect of LTX-109 can reduce or eradicate bacterial growth and thus also&#xD;
      the inflammatory stimulus of hidradenitis. The antiinflammatory effects of LTX-109 through&#xD;
      inhibition of bacterial colonization or infection can prevent rupture and proliferation of&#xD;
      follicular material in the dermis. Hidradenitis in more advanced stages can be targeted with&#xD;
      this investigational drug. However, it is not reasonable to expect that chronic, longstanding&#xD;
      inflammation and sinus formation will heal in six week of intervention. Therefore, patients&#xD;
      with most severe activity (Hurley stadium III) or with widespread disease (&gt;5 palm units)&#xD;
      will not be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator wishes to document whether LTX-109 is an effective compound on hidradenitis.&#xD;
      Evidence-based medical treatment of mild disease consists of topical antibiotics&#xD;
      (Clindamycin). Systemic antibiotics (Tetracycline) is used for disease that is more&#xD;
      widespread. In other parts of Europe, but not recommended in Norway due to the fear of&#xD;
      over-usage of Rifampicin, patients who fail to exhibit response to treatment or have a&#xD;
      moderate-to-severe disease, systemic Clindamycin 300 in combination with Rifampicin can be&#xD;
      given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients failing to exhibit response to treatment options mentioned above or for&#xD;
      moderate-to-severe disease, biologic therapy (Adalimumab) can be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interestingly, Bacterial growth in HS patients has shown a high level of resistance to&#xD;
      antibiotics, including rifampicin, clindamycin and tetracyclines, cited as an empiric choice&#xD;
      in HS therapeutic guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, other treatment options targeting bacteria in HS is warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It would be important to demonstrate whether the lytic peptidomimetic LTX-109 may be&#xD;
      effective in the condition as the treatment has apparent benefits, such as a good safety&#xD;
      profile, easy self-administered application and no known risk of development of resistance to&#xD;
      the Investigational Medicinal Product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be open label on 16 patients. Treatment will be twice daily application on&#xD;
      affected lesions for 6 weeks. Followup after end of treatment will be 3 months.&#xD;
