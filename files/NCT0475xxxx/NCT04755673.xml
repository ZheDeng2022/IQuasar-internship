  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (IBO) is a common functional condition due to excessive&#xD;
      amounts of bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract. These bacteria ferment ingested food&#xD;
      resulting in the production of hydrogen, methane, and carbon dioxide which subsequently can&#xD;
      induce GI symptoms including abdominal pain, bloating, distention, diarrhea and constipation.&#xD;
      Typically this condition is treated with antibiotics but for a portion of patients symptoms&#xD;
      often recur. Recent work suggests that increased methane production may emanate from&#xD;
      overgrowth of a specific type of archaebacteria, causing the aforementioned symptoms.&#xD;
      However, no current therapies exist to treat this phenomenon. The investigators propose to&#xD;
      trial the supplement Atrantil on patients with IMO in order to study the supplements impact&#xD;
      on symptoms, quality of life, and methane levels.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intestinal microbial overgrowth is associated with multiple gastrointestinal symptoms. Most&#xD;
      prevalent are gas-related symptoms (i.e. bloating, distention, increased flatus,&#xD;
      constipation)&#xD;
&#xD;
      . Intestinal microbial overgrowth can currently be divided into two main subcategories: small&#xD;
      intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) and intestinal methanogenic overgrowth (IMO). Both are&#xD;
      most commonly detected via breath testing-a simple non-invasive study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Despite the increasing prevalence of this disorder few evidence-based therapeutics&#xD;
           currently exist. SIBO, identified by elevations in breath hydrogen, has been shown to&#xD;
           respond to treatment with antibiotics including rifaximin and doxycycline in clinical&#xD;
           trials&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  However, IMO, detected by elevations in breath methane is a different disorder&#xD;
           attributed to overgrowth of archaea which reside predominately in the colon&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Currently, there are no evidence-based treatments for IMO, and the American College of&#xD;
           Gastroenterology guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of SIBO makes no specific&#xD;
           recommendations regarding the treatment of this disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Atrantil is a medical food composed of peppermint, quebracho tree bark, and horse chestnut.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These components are purported to reduce methane production, scavenge hydrogen (thus reducing&#xD;
      the building blocks for methane), and potentially act as a cidal agent for methanogenic&#xD;
      archaea. In a small randomized controlled-trial, Atrantil reduced bloating and constipation&#xD;
      in a population of individuals with irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given these initial results the investigators hypothesize that Atrantil may represent an&#xD;
      inexpensive and safe treatment for patients with excessive methane production. Thus, the&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to determine whether the holistic treatment, Atrantil, is beneficial&#xD;
      for the treatment of IMO.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Daily for 28 days</time_frame>
    <description>Numeric Rating Scale is a four-item scale measuring the severity of pain, bloating, distention, and discomfort on a scale of 1 to 10 for each measure. Higher scores indicate a higher level of symptom severity. Lower scores indicate a lower level of symptom severity.</description>

    <description>PROMIS GI Scales is a collection of eight categories of GI-symptoms (Belly pain, Bowel Incontinence, Constipation, Diarrhea, Disrupted Swallowing, Gas and Bloating, Nausea and Vomiting, and Acid reflux) Higher scores indicate a higher level of symptom severity. Lower scores indicate a lower level of symptom severity.</description>

    <description>SF-12 scale is a generic, multipurpose short-form survey with 12 questions selected from the SF-36 Health Survey to evaluate overall health-related quality of life. Answers are combined, scored and weighted into mental and physical functioning component scales. The scores for each scale range from 0 to 100. A higher value indicates a better quality of life of the patient.</description>

    <measure>Change in Quality of life as measured by the PROMIS-Global Health (PROMIS-GH)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline at four weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>PROMIS® Global Health Short Form (10 items). The 10 global health items include ratings of the five core PROMIS domains. It includes the most widely used self-rated health item (global01). PROMIS® includes a single item that provides a pure rating of physical health (global03) and another item for mental health (global04). Also included is an overall quality of life item (global02). The remaining items provide global ratings of physical function (global06), fatigue (global08), pain (global07), emotional distress (global10), and social health (global05 and global09). The 10 PROMIS® Global Health items each have 5 response choices, with the exception of the common 11-point pain intensity item (&quot;How would you rate your pain on average&quot; with 0=No pain and 10=Worst imaginable pain). Global 1-5, 9 range from 5 (Excellent) to 1 (Poor), with higher numbers meaning greater health. Certain items are restored (Global 7 such that 5=0 no pain, and 1=10 worst pain), Global8 (5=None, 1=Very Severe),</description>
