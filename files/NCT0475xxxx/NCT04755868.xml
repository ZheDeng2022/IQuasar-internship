  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a randomized phase II clinical trial of talazoparib maintenance&#xD;
      therapy in TNBC patients whose tumor showed clinical benefit (platinum-sensitivity) to first-&#xD;
      or second-line platinum-based chemotherapy (monotherapy or combination with other agents).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are eligible when they meet at least one of two following platinum-sensitivity&#xD;
      criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. They should have received 6 tri-weekly doses or 18 weekly doses of platinum-based&#xD;
           therapy in non-progression status (at least stable disease) at the time of enrollment;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. They should remain in complete or partial response status after 4-6 tri-weekly doses or&#xD;
           12-18 weekly doses of platinum-based chemotherapy. Eligible patients are enrolled to the&#xD;
           trial within 4 to 8 weeks after last chemotherapy and 1:1 randomized to receive&#xD;
           talazoparib versus placebo maintenance therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is PFS by RECIST 1.1 after randomization. The secondary endpoints&#xD;
      include OS, time from randomization to second progression or death (PFS2), and objective&#xD;
      response rate (ORR) by RECIST 1.1, adverse events by CTCAE 5.0 criteria, quality of life&#xD;
      evaluated by EORTC-QLQ-C30, and EuroQoL EQ-5D.&#xD;

      Randomized double-blind placebo controlled phase II trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized phase II study, and the TNBC patients&#xD;
      showing platinum-sensitivity after first- or second-line platinum-based chemotherapy will be&#xD;
      screened. The total doses of platinum-based chemotherapy will be 4 or 6 doses for tri-weekly&#xD;
      regimens and 12 or 18 doses for weekly regimen before randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
      . The platinum sensitivity is determined as follows,&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Remaining stable disease after 6 tri-weekly doses or 18 weekly doses of platinum-based&#xD;
           therapy (stable disease after 6 cycles)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Remaining complete or partial response status after 4-6 tri-weekly doses or 12-18 weekly&#xD;
           doses of platinum-based chemotherapy (partial or complete response after 4-6 cycles)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The platinum sensitivity of the patients will be determined before enrollment to the clinical&#xD;
      trial by review of central investigation institution (Yonsei Cancer Center) based on the the&#xD;
      image reading results and, if necessary, the raw imaging data to determine that there is no&#xD;
      tumor progression, tumor size increase, or new lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The platinum-based chemotherapy can be either monotherapy or combination doublet chemotherapy&#xD;
      of carboplatin or cisplatin with following combination partners: Paclitaxel, Docetaxel,&#xD;
      Gemcitabine, Eribulin, Vinorelbine, Capecitabine, and Nab-paclitaxel. The combined targeted&#xD;
      therapy agents including bevacizumab will be allowed but should be discontinued before&#xD;
      randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient with any BRCA1/2 mutation status is eligible. Germline BRCA1/2 test will be&#xD;
      performed with reimbursement from South Korean health insurance in the study subject, if the&#xD;
      subjects are under the age of 60 or have family history of BRCA-related cancers before&#xD;
      enrollment. The testing results will be verified by the investigator. If the germline BRCA1/2&#xD;
      test is not covered by national health insurance (patients over 60 years of age and no family&#xD;
      history), the BRCA1/2 germline testing will be performed with study support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The germline BRCA mutation status will be determined before randomization if the patient do&#xD;
      not have BRCA mutation results before. The eligible patients will be assigned to each&#xD;
      treatment arm after 1:1 randomization. The patients will be stratified on randomization with&#xD;
      following factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 1st line platinum-based chemotherapy versus 2nd line platinum-based chemotherapy*&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Response (CR/PR vs. stable disease) to the prior platinum-based chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. BRCA status: wild-type (including benign variants and variants of unknown significance)&#xD;
           versus BRCA1/2-mutated (pathogenic mutation)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  For the patient who recurred within 12 months after the last dose of (neo)adjuvant&#xD;
                chemotherapy for operable stage breast cancer, the (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy will&#xD;
                be considered as one line of chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Arm A (Experimental arm) Maintenance therapy with talazoparib (1mg once daily) (once&#xD;
      daily 1.0 mg oral administration), 103patients The Arm B (Control arm) Maintenance therapy&#xD;
      with placebo (once daily 1.0 mg oral administration), 103patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      The maintenance talazoparib will be initiated 4 to 8 weeks after the last dose of&#xD;
      platinum-based chemotherapy. The talazoparib treatment will continue until disease&#xD;
      progression by RECIST 1.1, unacceptable toxicity, or death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis will be&#xD;
      performed at baseline, and every 8 weeks until disease progression after then.&#xD;
