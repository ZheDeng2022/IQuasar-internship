  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of this study is to prospectively evaluate the occurrence of sleep disorders in&#xD;
      patients undergoing thoracic surgery due to the preliminary diagnosis of lung cancer.&#xD;
      Secondary aims include anxiety, depressive mood and functional outcomes before and 3 months&#xD;
      after the intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cancer surgery is one of the traumas that affect human life, starting from diagnostic&#xD;
      procedures, along with the recovery process. Although 5-year survival in lung cancer has&#xD;
      increased to 60%, there is a general prejudice that lung cancer has a poor prognosis. A&#xD;
      preliminary diagnosis of a such condition has consequently a negative effect on the mood and&#xD;
      sleep patterns of the patients, starting already from the beginning of the diagnostic&#xD;
      procedures. In our study, we want to evaluate the occurrence of sleep disorders, anxiety,&#xD;
      depressive mood and functional outcomes before and 3 months after the surgical intervention.&#xD;
      This would also help us to better identify the patients in need for professional support for&#xD;
      sleep disorders as well as psychiatric conditions, and thus, a better management of patients&#xD;
      with lung cancer.&#xD;

    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>High-risk Obstructive Sleep Apnea. Score range: 0-8 points, patients with a STOP-Bang score of 0 to 2 can be classified as low risk for moderate to severe OSA whereas those with a score of 5 to 8 can be classified as high risk for moderate to severe OSA.&#xD;
