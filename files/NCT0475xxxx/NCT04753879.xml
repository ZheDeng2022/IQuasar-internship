    <measure>Progression-free Survival (PFS) after 6 months according to RECIST 1.1 criteria.</measure>

    <description>PFS is defined as the 6 month from the date of randomization to disease progression (progressive disease [PD] or relapse from complete response [CR] as assessed using RECIST 1.1 criteria) or death due to any cause. Per RECIST 1.1 criteria, CR = disappearance of all target lesions, Partial Response (PR) is =&gt;30% decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions, Progressive Disease (PD) is &gt;20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions, Stable Disease (SD) is &lt;30% decrease or &lt;20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions.</description>
