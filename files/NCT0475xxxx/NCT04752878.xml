  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to describe the cultural adaptation of the Ottawa Sitting Scale and&#xD;
      to examine the factor structure, reliability and validity of the scale in patients with&#xD;
      stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scale will be translated into Turkish language by following the procedure. 80 patients&#xD;
      will be recruited in the study. Berg Balance Scale and Trunk Impairment Scale will be&#xD;
      included with Turkish Ottawa Sitting Scale to test the validity. Outcome measures will be&#xD;
      repeated by a second physiotherapist the day after the first assessment for interrater&#xD;
      reliability and conducted twice within 2 weeks (test-retest) for reliability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interrater and intrarater reliability of the Ottawa sitting scale will be determined&#xD;
      using intraclass correlation coefficients and internal consistency will be assessed using&#xD;
      Cronbach's alpha.&#xD;

    <description>A balance measurement scale for acute stroke patients. The scale tests the patient on a total of 10 items while sitting, with 5 items with eyes open and 5 items with eyes closed. An ordered scale (0-4) is used to score each item. The total score range of the scale is 0-40. Higher scores indicate a better outcome</description>

    <description>A balance measurement to determine the risk of falls. The scale consists of 14 items. Each item is scored between 0 and 4. 4 points indicate the ability to complete the task independently, 0 points indicate the failure to start the task. According to the scores, the cases are divided into groups as &quot;high risk of falling (0-20 points)&quot;, &quot;moderate fall risk (21-40 points)&quot;, &quot;low risk of falling (41-56 points)&quot; and the highest score 56 is considered to show the best balance</description>

    <description>A scale to evaluate motor disorders in the trunk after stroke. This scale consists of 3 sub-sections and 17 items that evaluate static sitting balance, dynamic sitting balance and coordination. The maximum score of the test is 40 points. High scores indicate good balance</description>
