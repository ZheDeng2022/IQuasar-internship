  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the effect of adaptive radiation planning in reducing side&#xD;
      effects associated with radiation treatment and immunotherapy in patients with stage II-IV&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer. Prior to radiation, patients undergo simulation, where they are&#xD;
      positioned on the treatment table in a manner that can be reproduced each time they receive&#xD;
      treatment in order to reach the tumor exactly at the same spot each time. However, a&#xD;
      patient's tumor may shrink as they receive radiation, exposing healthy tissue to radiation as&#xD;
      well. Adaptive radiation planning involves re-designing a treatment plan at set intervals.&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to see whether establishing set time points through adaptive&#xD;
      radiation planning, regardless of whether the doctor notices a significant decrease in tumor&#xD;
      size, will reduce some of the side effects associated with radiation treatment and&#xD;
      immunotherapy.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate whether implementing set intervals for radiation replanning reduces&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary toxicity and preserves healthy lung and heart tissue, with the intention of&#xD;
      establishing a new standard treatment modality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo computed tomography (CT) stimulation with or without intravenous (IV)&#xD;
      contrast over 1.5 hours on days -15 to -1, then undergo standard of care (SOC) chemoradiation&#xD;
      on days 1-40. Patients also undergo additional CT scan simulations without IV contrast over&#xD;
      20 minutes each on days 15 and 29.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 3-12 weeks, and then every 6 months&#xD;
      for approximately 2 years.&#xD;
