      Target question is as the following one:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Does the daily use of a fluoride-free, microcrystalline hydroxyap-atite (HAP) - containing&#xD;
      test toothpaste have a non-inferior caries preventing effect in the permanent dentition&#xD;
      compared to the regular use of a fluoride control toothpaste (1450 ppm F-) with proven caries&#xD;
      preventive efficacy (Walsh et al. 2019)? This multicenter, non-inferiority clinical trial,&#xD;
      randomized, double-blind, active-controlled design, two-armed study evaluates the hypothesis&#xD;
      that the home regular use of a toothpaste containing microcrystalline hydroxylapatite (HAP)&#xD;
      (test toothpaste) provides a caries preventive effect in adults aged 18-45 comparable to the&#xD;
      caries preventive effect provided by the regular use of a fluoridated tooth paste (1450 ppm&#xD;
      -F) (control toothpaste) over observation periods of max. 18 months. Caries development will&#xD;
      be assessed according to the clinical criteria of the Decay Missing Filling Surface Index&#xD;
      (DMFS).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Caries-preventing effects of hydroxyapatite toothpastes have been shown in vivo [children and&#xD;
      adolescents] (Schlagenhauf et al. 2019, Paszynska et al. 2021), in situ (Amaechi et al.&#xD;
      2019), and in vitro (Tschoppe et al. 2011). However, to date, the caries-preventing effect of&#xD;
      a hydroxyapatite toothpaste in adults (without orthodontic treatment) has not been&#xD;
      investigated in a clinical trial compared to fluoride toothpastes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this clinical trial is to assess in cohorts of adults whether 2 x daily tooth&#xD;
      brushing at home over an observation period of 18 months with a fluoride-free,&#xD;
      microcrystalline hydroxyapatite (HAP) - containing test toothpaste has a non-inferior caries&#xD;
      preventing effect in the permanent dentition compared to the regular use of a fluoride&#xD;
      control toothpaste (1450 ppm F-) with proven caries preventive efficacy (Walsh et al. 2019).&#xD;
      The study is designed as a multicentre, two armed, non-inferiority trial and will be&#xD;
      performed by 2 study centres in Poland. Caries development will be assessed by the Decay&#xD;
      Missing Filling Surface Index (DMFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are planned 4 visits for all subjects included to the project. Description of the 4&#xD;
      visits is presented below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1 (Screening and Baseline): Study day 0, informed consent, screening, collection of&#xD;
      baseline data, and study inclusion Subjects potentially suitable for the study will be&#xD;
      informed by the investigator about the nature, sig-nificance, and scope of the clinical trial&#xD;
      according to the requirements described in the written subject information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before study inclusion, the willingness of the subjects to properly follow the study protocol&#xD;
      during the complete treatment period of 546 days must be assessed. Only when subjects have&#xD;
      given their written informed consent, he/she will be included as study participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects have to meet all inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria. Unsuitable subjects&#xD;
      with un-treated caries in need of a restoration can become eligible after restorative&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once informed consent has been given, an initial examination will take place that covers the&#xD;
      follow-ing aspects:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening subjects for study eligibility (inclusion and exclusion criteria)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographic data Assessment of the study parameters has to be done on all teeth in the&#xD;
           following sequence&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Plaque control record (PCR)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Professional tooth cleaning&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  DMFS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  DIAGNOcam After the analysis of the plaque control record using a plaque-staining&#xD;
           solution (see O' Leary T, Drake R, Naylor, 1972), a professional tooth cleaning will be&#xD;
           performed. Thereafter, no fluoride gel/varnish etc. will be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, the study subjects receive an electric toothbrush with 3 brushing heads (replacement&#xD;
      of the brushing head every 2 months) and the allocated toothpaste (test or control) by a&#xD;
      trained study nurse or dentist not involved in clinical study examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proper use of the assigned electric toothbrush and the issued toothpaste is also instructed&#xD;
      by this study nurse or a dentist not involved in the clinical study examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2: Study day 182 (± 28 days at most), 1st follow-up examination 182 days after baseline&#xD;
      visit the following parameters are reassessed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Plaque control record (PCR)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Caries status (DMFS) as described for the baseline visit. Subsequently a study nurse or&#xD;
           a dentist not involved in clinical study examinations will hand out 3 new brushing heads&#xD;
           for the electric toothbrush and a new supply of the assigned experimental toothpaste&#xD;
           (test or control) for the next 182 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, the study nurse will subsequently check the efficacy of the oral hygiene efforts&#xD;
      of the subjects and if PCR will be &gt; 15%, will train again with the subjects an efficacious&#xD;
      brushing tech-nique. Finally, subjects receive a new appointment for visit 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3: Study day 364 (± 28 days at most), 2nd follow-up examination 364 days after baseline&#xD;
      visit the following parameters are reassessed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Plaque control record (PCR)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  DMFS as described for the baseline visit. Subsequently a study nurse or a dentist not&#xD;
           involved in the clinical study examinations will hand out 3 new brushing heads for the&#xD;
           electric toothbrush and a new supply of the assigned experimental toothpaste (test or&#xD;
           control) for the next 182 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, the study nurse will subsequently check the efficacy of the oral hygiene efforts&#xD;
      of the subjects and if PCR will be &gt; 15%, will train again with the subjects an efficacious&#xD;
      brushing tech-nique. Finally, subjects receive a new appointment for visit 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 4: Study day 546 (± 28 days at most), final visit 546 days after baseline visit the&#xD;
      following assessments are repeated:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Plaque control record (PCR)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Professional tooth cleaning&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  DMFS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  DIAGNOcam as described for the baseline visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods of Determining Efficacy and Safety Methods of Determining Efficacy DMFS-index and&#xD;
      PCR-scores will be determined by clinical examinations of the oral cavity. In addi-tion,&#xD;
      analysis of mineral density using DIAGNOcam will be conducted according to the instructions&#xD;
      of the manufacturer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments of all clinical findings will be performed only by experienced dentists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DMFS Index Calculation The DMFS Index (Decayed Missed Filled Surfaces) is one of the most&#xD;
      common methods in oral epidemiology for assessing dental caries prevalence as well as dental&#xD;
      treatment needs among populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DMFS Index calculation: There are five surfaces on the posterior teeth: facial, lingual,&#xD;
      mesial, distal, and occlusal. There are four surfaces on anterior teeth: facial, lingual,&#xD;
      mesial, and distal. The third molars are not counted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  When a carious lesion or both a carious lesion and a restoration are present, the&#xD;
           surface is listed as a D.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  When a tooth has been extracted due to caries, it is listed as an M.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  When a permanent filling is present, or when a filling is defective but not decayed,&#xD;
           this surface is counted as an F. Surfaces restored for reasons other than caries are not&#xD;
           counted as an F.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total count is 128 surfaces.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DIAGNOcam (KaVo Dental) DIAGNOcam will be used according to the instructions of the&#xD;
      manufacturer. The following classifi-cation will be used (Dent. Med. Probl. 2016, 53, 4,&#xD;
      468-475).&#xD;
&#xD;
      0 = Light transmission unchanged&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. = Shadow visible in enamel&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. = Shadow visible in dentin&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plaque Control Record The Plaque Control Record (O' Leary T, Drake R, Naylor, 1972) is a&#xD;
      simple method of recording the presence of the plaque on individual tooth surfaces.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the study visits a suitable disclosing solution such as Bismarck Brown, Diaplac or similar&#xD;
      is painted on tooth surfaces. After the subject has rinsed, the investigator (using an&#xD;
      explorer or a tip of a probe) examines each stained surface for soft accumulations at the&#xD;
      dentogingival junction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After all teeth are examined and scored, the index is calculated by dividing the number of&#xD;
      plaque containing surfaces by the total number of available surfaces.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plaque Index Calculation = The number of plaque containing surfaces / The total number of&#xD;
      available surfaces&#xD;
