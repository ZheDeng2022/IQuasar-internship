  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dysphagia is common problem in almost all children with cerebral palsy (CP) and there is no&#xD;
      consensus about to dysphagia therapy modalities.We aimed to investigate the short- and&#xD;
      long-term effects of kinesio taping (KT) on dysphagia in children with CP.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a few studies for the effectiveness of KT application in the treatment of dysphagia&#xD;
      and its effectiveness is controversial. These small-scale studies conducted to improve&#xD;
      control of drooling in the oral phase of swallowing in CP. However, there are no studies that&#xD;
      have evaluated swallowing as a whole. Moreover, there is a need to carry out studies&#xD;
      evaluating the efficacy of KT in dysphagia treatment with a high level of evidence and&#xD;
      duration of effectivenes for a period longer than 3 months. This study is designed to answer&#xD;
      the following research questions: &quot;Is KT application effective in the treatment of dysphagia&#xD;
      in CP?&quot; ''If it is effective, whether the effect of KT therapy persists more than 3 months''.&#xD;

    <description>Kinesiotape (KT) has been used by Dr. Kenzo Kase for the first time as based on the opinion that more successful results can be obtained in a banding method similar to the structural characteristics and flexibility of human skin without limiting the joint movements for edema control, joint protection, and proprioception training. In recent years, KT have been applied with a wide variety of techniques including muscle techniques for the inhibition and stimulation of muscles, fascia correction technique which aims to reduce tension and adhesions by making vibration movement between the fascia layers and field correction technique aiming to reduce regional pressure in the presence of pain, inflammation or edema as well as lymphatic correction technique for regulating lymphatic circulation .</description>
