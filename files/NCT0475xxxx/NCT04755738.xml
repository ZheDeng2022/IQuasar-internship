  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Almonertinib, as a third-generation EGFR-TKI, has been used for the treatment of advanced non&#xD;
      small cell lung cancer. How to improve the progression free survival in advance was a&#xD;
      challenge. Our previous study showed that first-line EGFR-TKIs plus microwave ablation had&#xD;
      PFS survival advantage versus EGFR-TKIs alone. So we conducted this prospective study to&#xD;
      verify the efficacy and safety of the combination in a randomized, controlled, phase II&#xD;
      clinical trial.&#xD;

      challenge. Our previous study showed that first-line EGFR-TKIs plus microwave ablation had&#xD;

      verify the efficacy and safety of the combination in a randomized, controlled, phase II&#xD;
      clinical trial. Patients were assigned into two groups.In the experiment group, patients were&#xD;
      treated with both Almonertinib and microwave ablation. In the control group, patients were&#xD;
      treated with Almonertinib alone. The primary end point was progression free survival. Second&#xD;
      endpoints included overall survival and safety.&#xD;
