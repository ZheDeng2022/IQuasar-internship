      There is currently no prospective study analyzing the effect of tracheostomy with bedside&#xD;
      simultaneous gastrostomy versus tracheostomy with delayed gastrostomy placement (TSG versus&#xD;
      TDG) on the outcomes of neurocritically-ill patients. The investigators will study TSG via&#xD;
      concomitant PDT and PUG procedures, while TDG will occur per usual care. This study is a&#xD;
      prospective randomized open-label blinded endpoint study to assess the effect of tracheostomy&#xD;
      with bedside simultaneous gastrostomy (TSG) versus the usual care of tracheostomy with&#xD;
      delayed gastrostomy (TDG) placement on outcomes of neurocritically-ill patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The practice of performing tracheostomy and gastrostomy simultaneously has been reported&#xD;
      since the 1980s. The safety and feasibility of simultaneous tracheostomy with gastrostomy&#xD;
      (TSG), compared to non-simultaneous or delayed approach (TDG), among neurocritically-ill&#xD;
      patients have been reported by various case series and retrospective cohort studies.The&#xD;
      timing of tracheostomy generally among neurocritically-ill patients varies from early &lt;5 days&#xD;
      or late &gt;7 -10 days. There are currently no guidelines specifically on neurocritically-ill&#xD;
      patients and the timing of gastrostomy placement however, it is generally recommended to wait&#xD;
      2-3 weeks as a time limited trial however, there are patients that are able to leave the&#xD;
      hospital with the main limitation as being the feeding access. Although it has been suggested&#xD;
      to consider tracheostomy to become an indication for gastrostomy this has not been widely&#xD;
      accepted although there is an increase in awareness of the TSG approach especially in&#xD;
      patients with neurologic conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tracheostomy have been traditionally indicated include airway obstruction associated with&#xD;
      infection, malignancy, injury, sleep apnea and vocal cord dysfunction, prolonged intubation,&#xD;
      facilitate weaning from mechanical ventilation, pulmonary hygiene and aspiration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gastrostomy tubes have been considered as standard of care for patients requiring alternate&#xD;
      forms of long-term enteral feeding. Other indications include long-term nutrition support&#xD;
      associated with neurologic or spinal cord deficits, primary swallowing dysfunction, facial or&#xD;
      pharyngeal injuries, malignancy of the head and neck and the esophagus, gastric&#xD;
      decompression. Approaches available to perform tracheostomy include open, percutaneous&#xD;
      tracheostomy, percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy (PDT); Percutaneous Radiologic&#xD;
      Tracheostomy and percutaneous ultrasound tracheostomy. Gastrostomy is a temporary or&#xD;
      permanent controlled fistula from the lumen of the stomach to the skin. For gastrostomy,&#xD;
      approaches include open surgical gastrostomy (SG) or Stamm gastrostomy, Percutaneous&#xD;
      endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), Percutaneous Radiologic gastrostomy (PRG) and Percutaneous&#xD;
      Ultrasound gastrostomy (PUG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a retrospective cohort study on the outcomes of neurocritically-ill patients who have&#xD;
      undergone TSG versus delayed gastrostomy TDG (non-simultaneous tracheostomy and gastrostomy),&#xD;
      the patients undergoing TSG had shorter Neurocritical Care Unit (NCCU) length of stay (LOS),&#xD;
      hospital LOS, overall hospital cost and higher pre-discharge prealbumin levels. In another&#xD;
      study examining the effect of early gastrostomy tube placement on stroke patients, it was&#xD;
      found that early gastrostomy tube placement was associated with shorter LOS and higher odds&#xD;
      of home or acute rehabilitation discharge disposition. In a retrospective study on&#xD;
      intracerebral hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage patients, it was found that tracheostomy&#xD;
      was associated with ICU LOS with almost a 10-day difference if tracheostomy is placed before&#xD;
      7 days or after 14 days. They also found a 6- day difference in overall length of stay&#xD;
      between those who had the gastrostomy tubes placed before 7 days or after 14 days.&#xD;
      Importantly they saw that the timing of tracheostomy and gastrostomy placement was not&#xD;
      associated with mortality. In practice, usual care favors delayed gastrostomy due to&#xD;
      availability of imaging resources, proceduralist coordination, and provider preference.&#xD;
      Bedside PEG requires the availability of specialized mobile endoscopic equipment and&#xD;
      physicians trained in upper endoscopy. In a retrospective study of TSG, among the most common&#xD;
      reason for procedural delays were coordination with GI service for performance of PEG.&#xD;
      Further, mobile endoscopes are expensive and uncommon across the healthcare system, thus&#xD;
      preventing PEG from practical generalizability as an early gastrostomy technique. TSG has&#xD;
      been performed using standard PDT and PUG. Because PUG utilizes point-of-care ultrasound&#xD;
      (POCUS) technology readily available at the bedside it is a generalizable method for early&#xD;
      gastrostomy. Finally, direct comparative evidence to support guidelines for TSG over TDG do&#xD;
      not exist. In the absence of clear guidelines, provider preference permits delayed&#xD;
      gastrostomy decisions.There is currently no prospective study analyzing the effect of&#xD;
      tracheostomy with bedside simultaneous gastrostomy versus tracheostomy with delayed&#xD;
      gastrostomy placement (TSG versus TDG) on the outcomes of neurocritically-ill patients. To&#xD;
      analyze the effect on patient outcomes of early intervention (TSG versus TDG), a pragmatic&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial is needed. The investigators will study TSG via concomitant PDT and&#xD;
      PUG procedures, while TDG will occur per usual care. This study is a prospective randomized&#xD;
      open-label blinded endpoint study to assess the effect of tracheostomy with bedside&#xD;
      simultaneous gastrostomy (TSG) versus the usual care of tracheostomy with delayed gastrostomy&#xD;
      (TDG) placement on outcomes of neurocritically-ill patients.&#xD;
