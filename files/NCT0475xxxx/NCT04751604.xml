  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on the literature, it seems likely that a nutritional intervention with nicotinamide (a&#xD;
      form of vitamin B3) can support the therapy of SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19). A pilot phase&#xD;
      of the COVit trial showed an effect of nicotinamide on the time to complete resolution of&#xD;
      COVID-19 symptoms. In addition, diarrhoea is a common symptom of COVID-19. Therefore, in a&#xD;
      second part of the study, 420 symptomatic patients each with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection&#xD;
      are to take 1,000 mg nicotinamide (500 mg conventional nicotinamide and 500 mg nicotinamide&#xD;
      released in a controlled manner in the intestine) or corresponding placebos per day in a&#xD;
      blinded fashion for 4 weeks. The primary endpoint of the trial is the frequency of complete&#xD;
      symptom resolution after 2 weeks of supplementation. Secondary endpoints are the frequency of&#xD;
      complete symptom resolution after 4 or 6 weeks of supplementation, the time from diagnosis to&#xD;
      symptom resolution as well as the frequency and severity of COVID-19 symptoms, particularly&#xD;
      also in the lower respiratory tract. The clinical WHO scale for COVID-19 and the development&#xD;
      of severe COVID-19 are also investigated. Patients are approached after positive testing and&#xD;
      give their informed consent online. After randomised distribution of the trial supplements,&#xD;
      patients are interviewed by telephone about their disease course at baseline and after 2, 4&#xD;
      and 6 weeks. Stool samples are collected from selected patients at week 0, week 1/2, week 4,&#xD;
      week 6 and after 6 months. In addition to blood count and standard blood profile, various&#xD;
      inflammatory markers and the metabolome, in particular tryptophan metabolism, are examined in&#xD;
      the blood. In these patients, the viral strain is be determined by sequencing from&#xD;
      nasopharyngeal swabs. In selected patients, short-term pharmacokinetics of nicotinamide,&#xD;
      nicotinic acid and nicotinuric acid as well as of metabolites of nicotinamide and tryptophan&#xD;
      are investigated. In the stool, changes in the microbiome (in 100 patients) as well as&#xD;
      metagenome and metabolome (in 20-30 patients) will be analysed. The study is expected to&#xD;
      produce rapid results on whether nicotinamide supplementation can alleviate the disease&#xD;
      course of COVID-19. Moreover, a follow-up interview, a smell test and a cognitive test&#xD;
      validated for phone surveys (T3MS) after 6 months will be used to investigate whether such a&#xD;
      supplementation has any influence on the post COVID-19 syndrome.&#xD;
