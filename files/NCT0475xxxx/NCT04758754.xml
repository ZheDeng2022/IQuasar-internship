  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Maintaining an adequate state of vascular function is an important element for the&#xD;
      maintenance of cardiovascular well-being. Several training plans involving both active and&#xD;
      passive engagement by the muscles have been proposed with the aim of improving vascular&#xD;
      function. At local level, i.e., at the level of the arteries that supply the muscles directly&#xD;
      involved in training, significant improvements in vascular function have been found. These&#xD;
      improvements are more noticeable after active training than with a passive training regimen,&#xD;
      such as passive static stretching. On the contrary, at the systemic level the effects of&#xD;
      active or passive training are less clear and, above all, it is not evident whether there is&#xD;
      a difference in the effects induced at the level of vascular function in arteries supplying&#xD;
      muscles not directly involved in training. The aim of the study is to clarify the local and&#xD;
      systemic effect of an active training protocol (single leg knee extension, SLKE) and of a&#xD;
      passive training protocol (passive static stretching training, PST) applied to the lower&#xD;
      limbs lasting 8 weeks on the local (femoral artery) and systemic (brachial artery) vascular&#xD;
      function.&#xD;

    <measure>Change from baseline in brachial artery flow mediated dilation</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline in percentage flow mediated dilation at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Flow mediated dilation was performed at brachial artery level. An arterial pressure cuff was placed around the forearm immediately distal to the olecranon process to provide an ischemic stimulus when inflated. Following baseline assessment, the blood pressure cuff was inflated to 250 mmHg. Artery diameter was and blood flow were resumed at baseline, 30 s prior to cuff deflation and continued for 2 min post-deflation by a linear array transducer attached to a high-resolution ultrasound machine. When an optimal image was obtained, the probe was held stable and longitudinal in B-mode, acquiring images of the lumen-arterial wall interface. Continuous Doppler velocity assessments were also obtained and collected using the lowest possible insonation angle (&lt;60°). Data were exported and analyzed using commercially available software. Flow mediated dilation was quantified as the maximal change in artery diameter after cuff release, expressed as a percentage increase above baseline (%).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in femoral artery delta blood flow</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline in Delta Blood Flow at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Femoral artery blood flow was calculated by Doppler ultrasound at baseline and at peak after single passive knee flexion and extension by using the femoral artery diameter and mean blood velocity. The difference between baseline and at peak blood flow identifies the Delta Blood Flow (ml/min).</description>
