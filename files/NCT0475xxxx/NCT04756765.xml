      This purpose of this study is to test if talazoparib is safe and evaluate its response to&#xD;
      advanced breast cancer associated with mutation of gene called PALB.&#xD;

      Primary Objectives: To evaluate whether talazoparib monotherapy can induce a 30% rate of&#xD;
      objective response in subjects with advanced breast cancer associated with a PALB2 mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective(s)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the safety of talazoparib in subjects with advanced PALB2 mutation&#xD;
           associated breast cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the progression free survival (PFS) of talazoparib monotherapy in subjects&#xD;
           with advanced PALB2 mutation associated breast cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate the clinical benefit rate (CBR) of talazoparib monotherapy in subjects with&#xD;
           advanced PALB2 mutation associated breast cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To evaluate the ability of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) to identify and characterize&#xD;
           the nature of PALB2 mutations at baseline and upon progression in subjects with advanced&#xD;
           PALB2 mutation associated breast cancer treated with talazoparib monotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To evaluate patient reported quality of life on talazoparib monotherapy&#xD;

    <time_frame>8 weeks +/-1 week</time_frame>
    <description>Response to treatment will be assessed as the number and proportion of participants who achieve either a confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). The outcome is reported as numbers without dispersion. Clinical response will be assessed as follows.&#xD;
CR: Complete disappearance of all clinical evidence of disease PR: Decrease in size or amount of measurable disease lesions Progressive disease (PD): Worsening of lesions; appearance of new lesions; or recurrence of lesions Stable disease (SD): Disease status that is neither CR, PR, nor PD.</description>

    <description>Clinical benefit rate (CBR) will be reported as the number and proportion of participants who achieve CR, PR or Stable Disease (SD) 6 months. The outcome is reported as numbers without dispersion.</description>

    <measure>Progression-free survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks +/- 1 week</time_frame>
    <description>Median progression free survival (PFS) will be assessed as the period of survival from therapy initiation without the development of progressive disease per RECIST 1.1. The outcome is reported as a number without dispersion.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient-reported Quality of Life (QoL)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks +/- 1 week</time_frame>
    <description>Change from Baseline in Global Health Status/Quality of Life (QoL) Measured by European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ C30) EORTC QLQ C30 has 30 questions. First 28 questions evaluate 5 functional scales and 3 symptom scales and other single items. Each question assessed on 4 point scale (1=not at all, 2=a little, 3=quite a bit, 4=very much); functional scales: higher score = better level of functioning; symptom scale: higher score = more severe symptoms; for single items: higher score= more severe problem. Last 2 questions evaluate global health status (GHS)/QoL. Each question is assessed on 7 point scale (1=very poor to 7=excellent). Scores averaged, transformed to 0-100 scale; higher score means a better quality of life/better level of functioning. The outcome will be reported as the median QoL score with standard deviation.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of participants with Treatment-related Adverse Events ≥ Grade 3</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Toxicity will be assessed as adverse events that are severe or greater (≥ Grade 3), and possibly, probably, or definitely related to talazoparib. The outcome will be reported as the total number of qualifying events, a number without dispersion.</description>
