  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An amputation represents a real ordeal for the person who will have to overcome the loss of a&#xD;
      limb and face long months of rehabilitation. It is most often carried out following arterial&#xD;
      insufficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As paramedical professionals, we see in our daily practice a physical and psychological&#xD;
      suffering for amputee patients. In spite of our skills acquired through training and&#xD;
      professional experience, we are unable to offer comprehensive care for these patients and&#xD;
      therefore feel that we are offering incomplete care. A multidisciplinary care, including a&#xD;
      medical and paramedical team, would seem to us to be more appropriate for patients with lower&#xD;
      limb amputations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following this observation, we would like to highlight the interest for the patient and the&#xD;
      care team to include a psychologist and a physiotherapist in the care offer to evaluate the&#xD;
      improvement of the physical and emotional state of the amputee patient.&#xD;

    <measure>To evaluate the relevance of the intervention of a physical therapist and a psychologist in the management of amputee patients in vascular surgery at 10 days post-operatively.</measure>
    <time_frame>at 10 days post-operatively</time_frame>
    <description>Mobility&quot; and &quot;Emotional Reactions&quot; scores collected from the Nottingham Health Profile (NHP) scale at 10 days post-operatively&#xD;
It is a self-questionnaire for measuring perceived health in the general population or in patients. It allows the measurement of health-related quality of life. It is in the form of a questionnaire with 38 questions to which the patient must answer &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;. A score of 1 point will be awarded for a positive answer and 0 points for a negative answer.&#xD;
A score between 0 and 100 is thus obtained for each patient for each item. This percentage corresponds to the degree of difficulty perceived by the subject in the area of each of the headings.</description>
