  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to establish the efficacy of identifying weight loss nonresponders early in&#xD;
      a Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) intervention in 20 community settings (primarily churches&#xD;
      and community centers) and providing them with individual-level, enhanced treatment through&#xD;
      telephone contacts and access to additional resources. Additionally, potential mediators and&#xD;
      moderators of the relationship between intervention status and weight loss response at 6&#xD;
      months in both nonresponders and responders will be examined and a cost-effectiveness&#xD;
      analysis to evaluate the cost of the intervention will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study addresses key gaps in the literature about the weight loss effects of identifying&#xD;
      nonresponders early and characterizing individuals who need more intense personalized&#xD;
      strategies. The investigators hypothesize that changes between baseline and 3 months will be&#xD;
      more pronounced among the nonresponders in the intervention group compared to the&#xD;
      nonresponders in the active control group.&#xD;

Participants will receive the DPP-GLB intervention once per week for 12 weeks, then twice monthly for 12 weeks (18 sessions total). The program includes hour-long group-based sessions and supportive materials including a weekly food diary and FitBit/pedometer. Intervention week 4, weight loss non-responders defined as weight loss less than 1% receive weekly telephone intervention, using motivational interviewing techniques to provide social support, assess barriers, resolve ambivalence, and support the participant in developing personal strategies. Additionally, this intervention includes weekly phone calls using motivational interviewing techniques to provide social support, assess barriers, resolve ambivalence, and support the participant in developing personal strategies.
