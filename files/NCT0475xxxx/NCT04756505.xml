  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is to find out the best dose, possible benefits and/or side effects of&#xD;
      NHS-IL12 given together with bintrafusp alfa and radiation therapy in treating patients with&#xD;
      hormone receptor positive, HER2 negative breast cancer that has spread to other places in the&#xD;
      body (metastatic). Immunotherapy with NHS-IL12, may induce changes in body's immune system&#xD;
      and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Immunotherapy with&#xD;
      bintrafusp alfa, a bifunctional fusion protein composed of the monoclonal antibody avelumab&#xD;
      and TGF-beta, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the&#xD;
      ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill&#xD;
      tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving NHS-IL12, bintrafusp alfa, and radiation therapy may&#xD;
      kill more tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of bintrafusp alfa (M7824) in combination with&#xD;
      immunocytokine NHS-IL12 (NHS-IL-12) and radiation therapy in patients with metastatic hormone&#xD;
      receptor positive (HR+)/HER2- breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of NHS-IL-12 in combination with M7824&#xD;
      and radiation therapy in patients with metastatic HR+/HER2- breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess immunologic/molecular responses, specifically percent (%) change in tumor&#xD;
      infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) pre and post therapy to M7824 in combination with NHS-IL-12&#xD;
      and radiation therapy in patients with HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To explore preliminary progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) to power&#xD;
      future definitive trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the in-field and abscopal effect of treatment with M7824 in combination with&#xD;
      NHS-IL-12 and radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To characterize circulating immune cell populations and cytokine profiles in tumor and&#xD;
      circulation following treatment with M7824.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To conduct tissue-based ribonucleic acid sequencing (RNAseq), RNA scope, whole exome&#xD;
      sequencing (WES) targeted sequencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To correlate dosimetry to response (assessed by degree of radiation fibrosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of NHS-IL-12 in combination with M7824.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of immunocytokine NHS-IL12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive bintrafusp alfa intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1 and 14 and&#xD;
      immunocytokine NHS-IL12 subcutaneously (SC) on day 14. Beginning on day 14 of cycle 1,&#xD;
      patients undergo radiation therapy once daily (QD) for up to 4 days. Cycles repeat every 28&#xD;
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.&#xD;
