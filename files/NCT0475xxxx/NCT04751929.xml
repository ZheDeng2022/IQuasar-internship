      This trial is testing whether a molecularly targeted chemotherapy drug called abemaciclib and&#xD;
      an immunotherapy drug called atezolizumab, alone or in combination, are effective in&#xD;
      shrinking or preventing the growth of metastatic prostate cancer. The trial is also testing&#xD;
      the safety of the combination of abemaciclib with atezolizumab.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open label Phase II study of patients with metastatic castration&#xD;
      resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who will be treated with abemaciclib and atezolizumab alone&#xD;
      or in combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved abemaciclib or atezolizumab&#xD;
      alone or in combination for use in prostate cancer. Abemaciclib is an orally administered&#xD;
      molecularly targeted chemotherapy drug called a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, which acts&#xD;
      to block the ability of cancer cells to divide and thus prevents tumors from growing. In the&#xD;
      laboratory setting, this drug is effective in prostate cancer models that have become&#xD;
      resistant to standard hormonal treatments, and this drug is currently being studied for its&#xD;
      effectiveness in prostate cancer in other clinical trials. Atezolizumab is an intravenously&#xD;
      administered drug called an immune checkpoint inhibitor, which acts to activate the immune&#xD;
      system to kill cancer cells. Atezolizumab is ineffective on its own in most patients with&#xD;
      prostate cancer, but is being tested in combination with other drugs for prostate cancer in&#xD;
      other clinical trials. Multiple research groups have demonstrated in laboratory model systems&#xD;
      that abemaciclib can may make immune checkpoint inhibitors more effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including&#xD;
      evaluations and follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design divides study participants into two separate cohorts. The first cohort is a&#xD;
      set of subjects whose tumors are not known to have mutations in the CDK12 gene (the&#xD;
      &quot;biomarker unselected cohort&quot;) - either because tumor tissue never underwent genetic&#xD;
      profiling, or because genetic profiling was performed but did not demonstrate a mutation in&#xD;
      the CDK12 gene. In this &quot;biomarker unselected cohort,&quot; this study will be testing whether&#xD;
      abemaciclib alone or in combination with atezolizumab is an effective treatment strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second cohort of participants is a set of subjects whose tumors are known to have&#xD;
      mutations in the CDK12 gene based on genetic profiling of the tumor that occurred prior to&#xD;
      enrollment on this study. Prior studies suggest that cancers with mutations in the CDK12 gene&#xD;
      can shrink in response to immune checkpoint inhibitors. This study will be testing in study&#xD;
      participants whose tumors are known to have mutations in CDK12 whether atezolizumab alone or&#xD;
      in combination with abemaciclib is an effective treatment strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the trial is testing the safety of the combination of the two drugs in both&#xD;
      cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive study treatment for as long as they do not have serious side&#xD;
      effects and their disease does not get worse. Participants will be followed after completion&#xD;
      of study treatment for up to 24 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that about 75 people will take part in this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eli Lilly and Company is supporting this research study by providing funding for research and&#xD;
      the study drug abemaciclib. Genentech, Inc. is supporting the study by providing the study&#xD;
      drug atezolizumab.&#xD;
