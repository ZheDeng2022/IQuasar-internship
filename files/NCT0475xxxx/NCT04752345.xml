  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      OPTIMAL-REPERFUSION is an investigator-initiated, prospective, multicenter, randomized,&#xD;
      open-label, superiority trial with blinded evaluation of outcomes. A total of 632 STEMI&#xD;
      patients presenting within 6 hours after symptom onset and with an expected time of medical&#xD;
      contact to percutaneous coronary intervention ≥120 min will be randomized to a reduced-dose&#xD;
      facilitated PCI strategy (reduced-dose fibrinolysis combined with simultaneous transfer for&#xD;
      immediate invasive therapy with a time interval between fibrinolysis to PCI &lt; 3 hours) or to&#xD;
      pharmacoinvasive treatment. The primary endpoint is the composite of death, reinfarction,&#xD;
      refractory ischemia, congestive heart failure, or cardiogenic shock at 30-days.&#xD;
