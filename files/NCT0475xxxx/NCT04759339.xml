    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, non-comparative study in healthy subjects designed to assess&#xD;
      systemic exposure to articaine and its metabolite articainic acid after dosing a single&#xD;
      topical ocular administration of AG-920 in the randomized study eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, subjects who provide informed consent and fulfill all the inclusion criteria&#xD;
      and none of the exclusion criteria will receive a single dose of study drug in one eye. The&#xD;
      study eye will be randomized. The single dose will be administered by the clinic staff as two&#xD;
      drops 30 seconds apart in study eye. Subjects will have pharmacokinetic (PK) blood samples&#xD;
      taken at multiple periods over 24 hours following dosing. Safety will be assessed by&#xD;
      monitoring any changes in heart rate, blood pressure, intraocular pressure, visual acuity,&#xD;
      biomicroscopy, and AEs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of 3 clinical visits: Screening Visit, Dosing and PK Blood Level&#xD;
      Sampling (0-8 hours) Visit and a Follow Up Visit (with PK blood level sampling 24 hours after&#xD;
      study drug treatment).&#xD;
