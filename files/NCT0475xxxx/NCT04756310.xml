  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Retinal diseases are currently the leading cause of legal blindness in the developed world.&#xD;
      Among these disorders, age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is one of the most prevalent&#xD;
      conditions in individuals over 55 years of age. Late AMD, the most severe presentation of the&#xD;
      disease, clinically manifests as either geographic atrophy (dry form) or choroidal&#xD;
      neovascularization (CNV) (wet form). Although patients with wet AMD only represent 10% of the&#xD;
      total cases, CNV is the main and most serious cause of central vision loss. At present, the&#xD;
      treatment of wet AMD comprises intraocular injections of certain antiangiogenic agents which&#xD;
      act by blocking VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor). No effective treatment is yet&#xD;
      available for dry AMD, though the AREDS (Age-Related Eye Disease Study) has shown that the&#xD;
      administration of antioxidant supplements is able to slow progression of the disease. Such&#xD;
      vitamin supplements are also indicated in patients who already have severe AMD (both&#xD;
      exudative and atrophic) in one eye, since the risk of progression in these cases is high.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies involving new antioxidant and antiangiogenic molecules such as resveratrol,&#xD;
      present in grapes and wine, have also revealed great efficacy in slowing the progression of&#xD;
      advanced AMD. Hydroxytyrosol is another polyphenol with important antioxidant and&#xD;
      antiinflammatory effects in the RPE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the above, the present randomized, multicenter interventional study involving&#xD;
      Spanish and Portuguese patients with unilateral wet AMD was designed to compare the effects&#xD;
      of two different nutritional supplements: one containing the antioxidants and minerals&#xD;
      recommended by the AREDS at doses that can be used in the European Union (Theavit), and the&#xD;
      other comprising these same substances plus omega-3 fatty acids (lipidic antioxidant), lutein&#xD;
      (pigment protecting against light-induced damage) and resveratrol (antioxidant and&#xD;
      antiangiogenic agent) (Retilut).&#xD;

      Retinal diseases are currently the leading cause of legal blindness in the developed world.&#xD;
      Among these disorders, age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is one of the most prevalent&#xD;
      conditions in individuals over 55 years of age. In the United States, the prevalence of AMD&#xD;
      varies from 0.5% at 55 years to 7% in people over 75 years. These data are clearly a cause&#xD;
      for concern, in view of the aging of the population in developed countries. In Spain, a&#xD;
      country with one of the greatest population aging problems, AMD affects 1.7% of all people&#xD;
      over 50 years, and the incidence increases with age, reaching 18.5% among those over 85&#xD;
      years. AMD is characterized by progressive destruction of the central region of the retina&#xD;
      (macula), resulting in central vision loss. While this does not lead to complete blindness,&#xD;
      the associated impairment of autonomy has a very strong impact upon patient quality of life.&#xD;
      AMD is a multifactorial disease - a fact that makes it difficult to establish the underlying&#xD;
      etiology. In this sense, although only age is accepted as the principal factor associated to&#xD;
      the development of AMD, other factors such as smoking, diet, oxidative stress, arterial&#xD;
      hypertension or obesity have been extensively investigated in the context of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Late AMD, the most severe presentation of the disease, clinically manifests as either&#xD;
      geographic atrophy (dry form) or choroidal neovascularization (CNV) (wet form). Although&#xD;
      patients with wet AMD only represent 10% of the total cases, CNV is the main and most serious&#xD;
      cause of central vision loss. At present, the treatment of wet AMD comprises intraocular&#xD;
      injections of certain antiangiogenic agents such as ranibizumab, bevacizumab, aflibercept,&#xD;
      etc., which act by blocking vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). No effective treatment&#xD;
      is yet available for dry AMD, though the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) has shown that&#xD;
      the administration of antioxidant supplements is able to slow progression of the disease.&#xD;
      Such vitamin supplements are also indicated in patients who already have severe AMD (both&#xD;
      exudative and atrophic) in one eye, since the risk of progression in these cases is high.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The AREDS, sponsored by the National Eye Institute, was started in 1998 with the purpose of&#xD;
      evaluating the effect of high-dose antioxidants (vitamins C and E, and beta-carotene) and&#xD;
      minerals (zinc) upon the course of the disease. The results of the study showed that high&#xD;
      levels of antioxidants and zinc significantly reduced the risk of progression towards&#xD;
      advanced stages of AMD by 25%, and of vision loss by 19%. However, due to safety reasons, the&#xD;
      doses used in the AREDS cannot be administered in the European Union, since they exceed the&#xD;
      Recommended Daily Allowances (RDA). Therefore, the standard clinical practice is to use these&#xD;
      substances in patients with high risk AMD as nutritional supplements at the usual RDAs.&#xD;
      However, no interventional studies demonstrating the effects of these supplements have been&#xD;
      carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following publication of the AREDS I, certain dietary intake studies suggested the importance&#xD;
      of other molecules such as omega-3 fatty acids (DHA, EPA, DPA) and lutein / zeaxanthin. The&#xD;
      AREDS work group therefore decided to conduct a new study including both nutrients in&#xD;
      addition to those already evaluated (antioxidants and zinc). Lutein exerts an antioxidative&#xD;
      effect, can act as a blue light filter, and moreover has antiinflammatory properties. This&#xD;
      latter effect is especially important, considering that AMD is a disease secondary to a&#xD;
      low-grade chronic inflammatory process of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). In addition&#xD;
      to their antioxidant and antiinflammatory effects, the omega-3 fatty acids have important&#xD;
      antiangiogenic properties, as evidenced both by in vitro and in vivo studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies involving new antioxidant and antiangiogenic molecules such as resveratrol,&#xD;
      present in grapes and wine, have also revealed great efficacy in slowing the progression of&#xD;
      advanced AMD. Hydroxytyrosol is another polyphenol with important antioxidant and&#xD;
      antiinflammatory effects in the RPE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the above, the present randomized, multicenter interventional study involving&#xD;
      Spanish and Portuguese patients with unilateral wet AMD was designed to compare the effects&#xD;
      of two different nutritional supplements: one containing the antioxidants and minerals&#xD;
      recommended by the AREDS at doses that can be used in the European Union (Theavit), and the&#xD;
      other comprising these same substances plus omega-3 fatty acids (lipidic antioxidant), lutein&#xD;
      (pigment protecting against light-induced damage) and resveratrol (antioxidant and&#xD;
      antiangiogenic agent) (Retilut).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: A randomized, double-blind, multicenter interventional nutritional dose study&#xD;
      was designed. The patient follow-up period will last 24 months. The estimated patient&#xD;
      enrollment period will cover 9 months, and analysis of the results will be completed four&#xD;
      months after the end of the follow-up period. The estimated total duration of the project&#xD;
      will be between 52 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      These patients from the different Spanish populations will be enrolled making use of the&#xD;
      infrastructure afforded by the RETICS network, &quot;Eye disease related to aging, vision quality&#xD;
      and quality of life&quot; (RD07/0062 subproject Retina). All patients will be 50 years old or&#xD;
      more, and written informed consent will be obtained in all cases, together with authorization&#xD;
      to enter their data in a database (data protection consent following the criteria of the&#xD;
      Ethics Committees of each of the participating centers).&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the baseline visit, the patients will undergo a complete ophthalmological evaluation, and&#xD;
      plasma will be collected for posterior analysis of several biochemical parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those patients who meet the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will start&#xD;
      nutritional supplementation for two years (2 daily capsule, nutritional dose) with one of the&#xD;
      nutritional supplements. The study will be carried out on a simple-blind basis, even the&#xD;
      patient knows the origin of the treatment, the ophthalmologist conducting follow-up will not&#xD;
      know the composition of the provided supplement. Accordingly, the boxes and capsules will be&#xD;
      adequately masked. The blisters with the nutritional supplements will be delivered to each&#xD;
      patient at the inclusión visit (Day 0), and the empty blisters are to be returned as an&#xD;
      initial measure of treatment compliance. Patient follow-up will take place every 6 months&#xD;
      (Day 0, Month 6, Month 12, Month 18, Month 24), and will comprise a complete ophthalmological&#xD;
      evaluation, with the registry of any ophthalmological adverse events. The appearance of such&#xD;
      adverse events will be a secondary study endpoint, and is defined as the appearance of&#xD;
      choroidal neovascularization in the fellow eye. First objective will be the measure of the&#xD;
      change in the best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in the study eye. Blood samples will be&#xD;
      collected at Day 0, Month 12 and Month 24 for biochemical analysis (Luminex® markers, omega&#xD;
      3, lutein and zeaxanthin profile and plasma REDOX status) representing also a secondary study&#xD;
      endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ophthalmological examination:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visual acuity will be determined with the ETDRS system at a distance of four meters with&#xD;
           the best optic correction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anterior segment biomicroscopy study to discard opacification of the media.&#xD;
           -Biomicroscopic funduscopy with +78/+90D lens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Digital retinography of the ocular fundus, red-free light photography of the fundus, and&#xD;
           autofluorescence photography of the fundus under maximum pharmacologic mydriasis to&#xD;
           ensure maximum image quality; a minimum of three examinations with photographs at 30/35°&#xD;
           will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The follow-up of neovascularization will be carried out by fluorescein angiography and&#xD;
           optical coherence tomography (OCT). The presence of subretinal and/or intraretinal fluid&#xD;
           will be taken as a sign of wet AMD in OCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biochemical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The plasma of the patients both on Day 0 and at the end of the study will be subjected to the&#xD;
      following determinations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analysis of the lipid profile (omega 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of the systemic oxidative condition based on total antioxidant capacity&#xD;
           assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determination of lutein levels by HPLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Detection of the main inflammatory and oxidative stress markers and/or vascular factors&#xD;
           in plasma, based on Luminex® technology (affymetrix): VEGF-A, IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8,&#xD;
           Eotaxin-2 (CCL24), HGF, PDGF, MCP-1, TNF-alpha and FGF.&#xD;
