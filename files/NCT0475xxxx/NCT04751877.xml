  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Overall the issue of patients above 65-70 years of age being that it is impossible for most&#xD;
      of them to undergo an intensive treatment like autologous stem cell transplant with little&#xD;
      prospect of debulking effectively the bone marrow with chemotherapy, and also few&#xD;
      possibilities to harass the bone microenvironment in the tumoral niche.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If, advanced age in frail patients is predictive of an increased risk of treatment-related&#xD;
      toxicity, there is a growing number of elderly patients in regards to transplantation, but&#xD;
      still fit if one considers the objectives of life characterized with prolonged survival.&#xD;
      These patients might have the same treatment as to the transplant eligible, but without the&#xD;
      transplant procedure. The development of immunotherapy has transformed the treatment&#xD;
      landscape of cancer, particularly in MM, increasing the treatment possibilities with possibly&#xD;
      fewer adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The therapeutic strategy and treatment options for NTE patients moved from melphalan-based&#xD;
      induction regimens to lenalidomide-based associations, which is now the backbone of most&#xD;
      treatment for NTE patients. Even though the latest melphalan, bortezomib and prednisone (MPV)&#xD;
      association was considered somewhat effective it was not so well tolerated. Furthermore, MPV&#xD;
      hardly prolonged PFS beyond 2 years. It was recently improved with the addition of&#xD;
      Daratumumab, first in class anti CD38 Mab in the phase III ALCYONE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The association lenalidomide and dexamethasone (Rd) has significantly improved the easiness&#xD;
      of treating the NTE population and all drugs seem to be possible to combine to Rd. In that&#xD;
      extent, proteasome inhibitors have always been one of the most impactful family of agents in&#xD;
      MM, and as expected Bortezomib plus Rd has become a very relevant and commonly used regimen&#xD;
      in NTE NDMM. These groundbreaking results have favored the development of 2 randomized phase&#xD;
      3 studies for registration of combination of antiCD38Mab (Daratumumab (Cepheus, NCT03652064),&#xD;
      Isatuximab (Imroz, NCT03319667) +Rd +Velcade in comparison to VRd. Both studies have used as&#xD;
      a comparator the VRd regimen which is today one of the safest, active and popular triplet&#xD;
      based Rd regimen, approved, and therefore the best control arm possibly for these studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, as much as there has been no direct head to head comparison of VRd to Dara Rd, when&#xD;
      looking at the data from Maia it is anticipated that DRd will become a standard of care, and&#xD;
      might challenge strongly VRd. Yet, multiple questions remain still, anticipating the change&#xD;
      in backbone from VRd to antiCD38 +Rd becoming the new standard of care for NTE NDMM patients.&#xD;
      The investigators have therefore planned to answer the critical question of the role of&#xD;
      proteasome inhibitors in NTE non frail NDMM when considering anti CD38 +Rd as the backbone.&#xD;

        the anti-HBV therapy and monitoring should continue throughout the study treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        o • Patients with negative HBsAg and positive HBV DNA observed during screening period will&#xD;
