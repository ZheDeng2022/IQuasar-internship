  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the impact of sacubitril/valsartan on elevated pulmonary artery (PA)&#xD;
      pressures in patients with heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF),&#xD;
      measured using a previously implanted hemodynamic monitoring device (CardioMEMS).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fluid overload leading to increased PA pressure is one of the primary causes of HF related&#xD;
      hospitalizations in HFpEF. Signs and symptoms of fluid overload are not sensitive enough to&#xD;
      reflect early pathophysiologic changes that increase the risk of decompensation. Elevations&#xD;
      in PA pressure may increase several days or weeks before signs and symptoms manifest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CardioMEMS device is a small wireless sensor that is permanently implanted in the PA via&#xD;
      a catheter inserted through the femoral vein. The sensor measures PA pressure and is paired&#xD;
      with a portable electronic transmitter. The system allows patients to wirelessly transmit&#xD;
      pressure readings to a secure online database from which treating physicians can access the&#xD;
      data and adjust medication in response to PA pressure changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CHAMPION trial was a single blind randomized clinical trial that showed a significant and&#xD;
      large reduction in hospitalizations in patients with NYHA class III HF who were managed with&#xD;
      a the CardioMEMS device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More recently, real life clinical practice has confirmed the value of PA pressure-guided&#xD;
      therapy for HF. PA pressures were reduced, lower rates of HF hospitalizations and all-cause&#xD;
      hospitalization, and low rates of adverse events across a broad range of patients with&#xD;
      symptomatic HF and prior HF hospitalizations were reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) led to a reduced risk of hospitalization&#xD;
      for HF or death from cardiovascular causes among patients with HF and reduced ejection&#xD;
      fraction in the PARADIGM-HF trial. However it did not result in a significantly lower rate of&#xD;
      total hospitalizations for HF and death from cardiovascular causes among patients with HF and&#xD;
      an ejection fraction of 45% or higher in the PARAGON-HF trial, despite there was suggestion&#xD;
      of heterogeneity with possible benefit with sacubitril-valsartan in patients with lower&#xD;
      ejection fraction and in women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARNI reduced pulmonary pressures and vascular remodeling in an animal model of pulmonary&#xD;
      hypertension (PH) and may be appropriate for treatment of PH and right ventricle dysfunction.&#xD;
      Data are lacking on the hemodynamic effects of ARNI on pulmonary hypertension in patients&#xD;
      with HFpEF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will assess the impact of sacubitril/valsartan on PA pressures measured using an&#xD;
      implanted PA monitoring device. The device will be used according to approved indications.&#xD;
