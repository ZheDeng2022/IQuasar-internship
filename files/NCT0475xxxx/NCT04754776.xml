      Phase I open label, non-randomised dose escalation study on healthy UK volunteers aged from&#xD;
      18 to 50 years to assess the safety and immunogenicity of ChAdOx1 RVF&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test a new vaccine against the Rift Valley Fever Virus (RVFV)&#xD;
      in healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rift Valley fever is a disease caused by RVFV and it is transmitted to humans through a&#xD;
      mosquito bite or contact with virus-contaminated tissues and fluids. Although initially&#xD;
      restricted to Africa, the virus can be transmitted by several different mosquito species that&#xD;
      are more widely distributed than the virus itself, leading to concerns of disease spread as&#xD;
      has occurred in the Arabian Peninsula and Madagascar. In humans, RVFV infection usually&#xD;
      presents as a sudden febrile illness, but severe manifestations including bleeding disorders&#xD;
      and neurological complications may also occur. RVFV is considered a global health threat with&#xD;
      significant potential for international spread and use in bioterrorism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vaccines against RVFV are available for livestock, however no licensed vaccines or specific&#xD;
      treatments are currently available for humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enable assessment of the safety of the new vaccine called ChAdOx1 RVF and the&#xD;
      extent of immune response in healthy volunteers. Healthy adult volunteers will receive a&#xD;
      single dose of a new candidate vaccine at different doses. The objective of this&#xD;
      first-in-human study is to find the optimal dose of the vaccine, balancing immune responses&#xD;
      and profile of adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers aged 18-50 will be recruited in Oxford and vaccinated at the Centre for&#xD;
      Clinical Vaccinology and Tropical Medicine and will be followed for a period of 3 months. The&#xD;
      study is funded by the UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council(BBSRC) and&#xD;
      the Medical Research Council (MRC)/Department of Health, through the UK Vaccines Network.&#xD;
