  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Recently, two prospective multicenter RCT reported a potential beneficial effect&#xD;
      of endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) in patients with an acute symptomatic basilar artery&#xD;
      occlusion (BAO). However, the high rate of crossover in BEST study and the long-term of&#xD;
      recruitment in BASICS study influenced the validity of the results. Besides, a recently&#xD;
      prospective clinical registry with large sample size (BASILAR) showed a significantly&#xD;
      beneficial effect of EVT in BAO patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To assess the effect of EVT in addition to best medical management (BMM) compared&#xD;
      to BMM alone, in patients with BAO, caused by a CTA/MRA confirmed occlusion of the basilar&#xD;
      artery on functional and safety outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: This is a parallel group, randomized clinical trial of EVT with BMM versus BMM.&#xD;
      The trial has observer blind assessment of the primary outcome and of neuro-imaging at&#xD;
      baseline and follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Patients with acute ischemic stroke and a confirmed basilar artery&#xD;
      occlusion by CTA/MRA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/outcomes: The primary effect parameter will be favourable outcome at&#xD;
      day 90 defined as a modified Rankin Score (mRS) of 0-3. The estimate will be adjusted for the&#xD;
      known prognostic variables age, pre-stroke mRS, time from onset to randomization, stroke&#xD;
      severity (NIHSS) and collaterals and adjusted and unadjusted estimates with corresponding 95%&#xD;
      confidence intervals will be reported.&#xD;

    <description>Unless contra-indicated patients are treated with a standard full dose of open-label IV rt-PA (0.9mg/kg; 90mg maximum).

    <description>Device: endovascular treatment For patients randomized to endovascular treatment arm, EVT has to be initiated within 12 hours of estimated time of basilar artery occlusion. If an appropriate thrombus or residual stenosis is identified, the choice of EVT strategy will be made by the treating neurointerventionalist. The endovascular procedures allowed by the steering committee include mechanical thrombectomy, intra-arterial thrombolysis, balloon angioplasty, stent implantation, or any combination of above procedures. We recommend applying ADAPT as the first choice of treatment. All mechanical thrombectomy devices for EVT, which are approved by CFDA for this purpose, are allowed in the trial.</description>
