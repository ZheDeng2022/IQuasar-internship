  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative pain is an important issue in patients underwent mastectomy and axillary&#xD;
      dissection surgery. Postoperative effective pain treatment provides early mobilization and&#xD;
      shorter hospital stay. The US-guided erector spina plane block (ESPB) may be used for&#xD;
      postoperative pain treatment following breast surgery. It is a novel interfascial block that&#xD;
      was defined by Forero. Rhomboid intercostal block (RIB) is a novel block and was first&#xD;
      described by Elsharkawy et al. Local anesthetic solution is administrated between the&#xD;
      rhomboid muscle and intercostal muscles over the T5-6 ribs. It has been reported that RIB may&#xD;
      provide effective analgesia management for several breast surgeries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of the study is to compare postoperative pain scores (VAS), and the secondary&#xD;
      aim is to evaluate postoperative opioid consumption, adverse effects related with opioids&#xD;
      (allergic reaction, nausea, vomiting).&#xD;

      Postoperative pain is an important issue in patients underwent mastectomy and axillary&#xD;
      dissection surgery. Postoperative effective pain treatment provides early mobilization and&#xD;
      shorter hospital stay, thus complications due to hospitalization such as infection and&#xD;
      thromboembolism may be reduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various methods may be performed to reduce the use of systemic opioids and for effective pain&#xD;
      treatment following mastectomy and axillary dissection surgery. Ultrasound (US)-guided&#xD;
      interfascial plane blocks have been used increasingly due to the advantages of ultrasound in&#xD;
      anesthesia practice. Rhomboid intercostal block (RIB) is a novel block and was first&#xD;
      described by Elsharkawy et al. Local anesthetic solution is administrated between the&#xD;
      rhomboid muscle and intercostal muscles over the T5-6 ribs 2-3 cm medially of the medial&#xD;
      border of the scapula. RIB targets both the posterior rami and lateral cutaneous branches of&#xD;
      the thoracic nerves and provides analgesia for the hemithorax from T2 to T9. It has been&#xD;
      reported that RIB may provide effective analgesia management for several breast surgeries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The US-guided erector spina plane block (ESPB) is defined by Forero et al. ESPB provides&#xD;
      thoracic analgesia at T5 level and abdominal analgesia at T7-9 level. ESPB contains a local&#xD;
      anesthetic injection into the deep fascia of erector spinae. Visualization of sonoanatomy is&#xD;
      easy, and the spread of local anesthesic agents can be easily seen under the erector spinae&#xD;
      muscle. Thus, analgesia occurs in several dermatomes with cephalad-caudad way. In the&#xD;
      literature, it has been reported that ESP block provides effective analgesia after several&#xD;
      surgeries such as open heart surgery, breast surgery, thoracoscopic and abdominal operations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the US-guided ESPB and RIB for&#xD;
      postoperative analgesia after mastectomy and axillary dissection surgery. The primary aim is&#xD;
      to compare postoperative pain scores (VAS), and the secondary aim is to evaluate opioid&#xD;
      consumption, adverse effects related with opioids (allergic reaction, nausea, vomiting).&#xD;

    <description>In group ESPB, ESPB will be performed with patients in the lateral decubitus position while the surgical site up. US probe will be placed 2-3 cm lateral to the T4 transvers process. The block needle will be inserted cranio-caudal direction and then for correction of the needle 5 ml saline will be injected deep into the erector spina muscle fascia. Following confirmation of the correct position of the needle 30 ml %0.25 bupivacaine will be administered for block.</description>

    <description>In group RIB, RIB block will be performed with patients in the lateral decubitus position while the surgical site up. The linear high frequency probe will be placed in sagittal plane medially on the medial border of the scapula at T5-6 level. The trapezius muscle, rhomboid major muscle, intercostal muscle, ribs and the pleura will be visualized. The needle will be inserted into the fascial plane between the rhomboid major and intercostal muscles in a cranio-caudal direction. A dose of 30 ml 0,25% bupivacaine will be injectted into the fascial plane.</description>
