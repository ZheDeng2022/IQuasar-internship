  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parents of children with Down Syndrome can help in describing children's abilities and&#xD;
      behavior. Most of the studies evaluating parents of children with Down Syndrome and other&#xD;
      intellectual disabilities have focused on parental stress and coping; Additionally, most&#xD;
      research has evaluated the perspectives of mothers rather than fathers. For this reason, in&#xD;
      this study we aims to evaluate skills and behaviors in children with Down syndrome through&#xD;
      the perception of parents.&#xD;

    <measure>Early Motor Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The EMQ is designed as a fast and easy to complete motor questionnaire, and is organized into 3 sections: Gross motor skills, fine motor skills, and perception-action integration skills. The EMQ is not a standardized assessment, but can be used in research settings, serve as a motor screener, or as complement to standardized measures of early motor development.</description>

    <measure>Montreal's children's Hospital Feeding Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Montreal Children's Hospital Feeding Scale (MCHFS) is a quick and reliable measure of feeding problems for clinical settings, but there is little examination of its relationship to commonly used research measures of parental feeding practice, child eating behaviour and observations of parent-infant interaction at mealtimes.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Feeding Hándicap Índex Children</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>y the Feeding Handicap Index (FHI), [20] was developed and standardized on typically developing children, children with CP, Autism spectrum disorder in the age range of 2-10 years and Intellectual disability. FHI has 38 items related to statements related to physical (21), emotional (12) and functional (5) aspects of feeding and swallowing abilities. It has a 3 point rating scale (0, 1 &amp; 2) where &quot;0&quot; indicates the individual &quot;Never has this problem&quot;, &quot;1&quot; indicates &quot;Sometimes has this problem&quot; and &quot;3&quot; indicates &quot;Always has this problem&quot;</description>

  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>is an individually administered scale that assesses five key developmental domains in children between 1-42 months of age: cognition, language (receptive and expressive communication), motor (gross and fine), social-emotional and adaptive behavior. The first three are assessed through direct observation of the child in test situations, while the last two are assessed through questionnaires to be completed by the main caregiver.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Early Clinical Assessment of Balance</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Early Clinical Assessment of Balance (ECAB) is a measure of postural stability for children.</description>

    <measure>Infant Positioning Assessment Tool</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Infant Position AssessmentTool (IPAT) is a six-item tool with cumulative scores ranging from 0 to 12. It was developed as a teaching tool to standardize developmentally supportive positioning practices in the NICU and provides a method for evaluation of those positioning practices.</description>

    <measure>COMFORT behaviour scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The COMFORT behaviour scale (COMFORT-B scale) is widely used in paediatric intensive care units to assess young children's pain and distress.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Segmental Assessment of Trunk Control</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The SATCo i,ii is a validated outcome measure that identifies at which head/trunk segment Targeted Training should commence. The SATCo determines the topmost (most cephalo) segment at which control of the upright posture is poor or not demonstrated i.e. is currently being learned for each of static, active and reactive control.</description>

    <measure>EuroQol-5D</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The perception of the level of health and the quality of life were evaluated with the questionnaire European Quality of&#xD;
Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D). It is composed of 2 parts in which health status is assessed:&#xD;
Descriptive system: It consists on 5 dimensions that include mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Patients classify their health status in 3 severity levels: having no problems, having some or moderate problems, being unable to do/having extreme problems.&#xD;
Visual Analog Scale, by which respondents can report their perceived health status with a grade ranging from 0 (the worst possible health status) to 100 (the best possible health status)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Anxiety and depression will be assessed with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) . This scale is composed of 14 items divided into two subscales, 7 items of anxiety and 7 items of depression, involving higher values worse psycho-emotional state</description>

    <measure>Zarit Burden Interview</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Zarit Burden Interview, is a popular caregiver self-report measure used by many aging agencies. Each item on the interview is a statement which the caregiver is asked to endorse using a 5-point scale. Response options range from 0 (Never) to 4 (Nearly Always).</description>

    <measure>Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire (BISQ) is used to assess sleep patterns, parent perception, and sleep-related behaviors in young children (0-36 months).
