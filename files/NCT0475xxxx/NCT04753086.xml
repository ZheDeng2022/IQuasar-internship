  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to see if it is feasible to use electronic questionnaires to&#xD;
      measure patient related outcomes before, during, and after radiation for gynecologic cancer&#xD;
      in a high-volume radiation oncology clinic.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Other studies have found benefits from using patient related outcome measurements (PROM) in&#xD;
      clinical settings, and a paper PROM is part of standard of care treatment for prostate cancer&#xD;
      patients at the University of North Carolina clinic. However, PROM are not routinely&#xD;
      collected for gynecological cancer patients at UNC, and fewer studies have specifically&#xD;
      focused on PROM for gynecological cancer patients receiving radiation. The primary objective&#xD;
      of this study is to determine the feasibility of PRO monitoring of gynecologic symptoms&#xD;
      before, during (at weekly intervals), and after radiation (external beam radiotherapy and&#xD;
      brachytherapy) for gynecologic cancer patients at a high volume center.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of survey completion at acute timepoints</measure>
    <time_frame>First week of radiation to 6 weeks after completing radiation</time_frame>

    <description>Percentage of patients who complete at least 75% of the questionnaires given after and including the 6-month post-treatment survey and up to and including the 2-year post-treatment survey</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Late, persistent, substantial, treatment-related symptoms (LAPERS)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months post-treatment to 2 years post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>LAPERS will only be calculated for patients who have baseline symptoms (actual baseline or 3 months post-treatment, whichever is lower), one early follow up assessment (1, 2, or 6 week post-treatment), and at least 3 late follow ups (6 months post-treatment or later). If a patient's symptom worsened to &quot;quite a bit&quot; or &quot;very much&quot; in at least half of the late follow-ups, this will be considered LAPERS. Thus LAPERS is a binary score that will be assessed for each symptom in each patient.</description>
