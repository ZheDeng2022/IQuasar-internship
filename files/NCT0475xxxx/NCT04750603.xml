  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exercise induced asthma (EIA) is common in adolescents. (Fluticasone furoate (FF)/Vilanterol&#xD;
      (VI)) is a once daily inhaler with bronchodilator effect lasting 24 hours. Our objective was&#xD;
      to investigate the short and long-term effects of FF/VI on EIA in adolescents. Adolescent&#xD;
      asthmatics were referred for evaluation of EIA. Patients with a positive exercise challenge&#xD;
      test, were allocated to a single administration of salbutamol and 22 to FF/VI in a double&#xD;
      blind, double dummy method to assess the short-term effect on EIA. Then they received FF/VI&#xD;
      for 30-60 days and were reassessed by a repeat exercise test 24-hours after the last dose.&#xD;

      Exercise induced asthma (EIA) is common in adolescents. Relvar® (Fluticasone furoate&#xD;
      (FF)/Vilanterol (VI)) is a once daily inhaler with bronchodilator effect lasting 24 hours.&#xD;
      Our objective was to investigate the short and long-term effects of FF/VI on EIA in&#xD;
      adolescents. Ninety-three adolescent asthmatics aged 12-18 years were referred for evaluation&#xD;
      of EIA. 44 patients had a positive exercise challenge test (ECT), 22 (22/44) were allocated&#xD;
      to a single administration of salbutamol (400 µg) and 22 to FF/VI (92/22 µg) in a double&#xD;
      blind, double dummy method to assess the short-term effect on EIA. Then they received FF/VI&#xD;
      for 30-60 days and were reassessed by a repeat ECT 24-hours after the last dose.&#xD;
