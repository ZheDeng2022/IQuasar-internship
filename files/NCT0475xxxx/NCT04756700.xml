  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to establish scores of Cognitive impairment (CI) of&#xD;
      the 3 DigiCog [Brief Computerized Cognitive Assessment for Multiple Sclerosis (BCCAMS) app]&#xD;
      tests [Computerized Speed Cognitive Test (CSCT), Computerized Episodic Visual Memory Test&#xD;
      (CEVMT) and the French Learning Test (FLT), a verbal memory test similar to the CVLT], using&#xD;
      a tablet application in a sample of healthy participants matched to persons with MS (PwMS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of this study are to determine the ability of the DigiCog app to&#xD;
      detect cognitive impairment (CI) compared to the classical Brief International Cognitive&#xD;
      Assessment for MS (BICAMS) in PwMS; to determine the relationship between depressive symptoms&#xD;
      and cognitive performance in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) sample; to determine the relationship&#xD;
      between subjective perception of CI and cognitive performance ; to evaluate the reliability&#xD;
      of Konectom™ digital outcome assessments (DOAs) in healthy subjects (HS) and PwMS; to&#xD;
      evaluate the convergent validity of Konectom™ digital outcome assessments (DOAs) against&#xD;
      in-clinic conventional disability outcome assessments in PwMS; to evaluate differences in&#xD;
      Konectom™ DOAs [self administered at home and in-clinic] between PwMS and HS; to evaluate the&#xD;
      variability of Konectom™ DOAs self-administered at home in free-living environment in HS and&#xD;
      PwMS; to compare Konectom™ DOAs between in-clinic supervised administration versus&#xD;
      self-assessments in free-living environment in HS and PwMS; to evaluate the clinical&#xD;
      meaningfulness of Konectom™ DOAs against Patient-Reported Outcomes (PRO) in PwMS.&#xD;
