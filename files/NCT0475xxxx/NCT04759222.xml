  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Microcirculatory disturbance occurs most seriously during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) in&#xD;
      cardiac surgery. If microvascular reactivity compensates for microcirculatory disturbance&#xD;
      during CPB, tissue hypoxemia may be minimized. On the other hand, tissue hypoxemia may&#xD;
      develop and lead to poor clinical outcomes. The primary aim of this study was to assess&#xD;
      whether microvascular reactivity during CPB can predict major adverse events (MAE) within 30&#xD;
      days after cardiac surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective, observational, single-center study was conducted on 115 patients who&#xD;
      underwent elective on-pump cardiac surgery. The vascular occlusion test (VOT) with&#xD;
      near-infrared spectroscopy was performed five times for each patient, before the induction of&#xD;
      general anesthesia (baseline, T0), 30 min after the induction of general anesthesia (T1), 30&#xD;
      min after applying CPB (T2), 10 min after injection of protamine (T3), and after sternal&#xD;
      closure (T4). Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) and Acute Physiologic and Chronic&#xD;
      Health Evaluation (APACHE) II scores and the length of ventilator care, intensive care unit&#xD;
      stay, and hospital stay were recorded. Postoperative MAE within 30 days after surgery was&#xD;
      also recorded.&#xD;

      The VOT was performed five times in each patient, before the induction of general anesthesia&#xD;
      (baseline, T0), 30 min after the induction of general anesthesia (T1), 30 min after applying&#xD;
      CPB (T2), 10 min after injection of protamine (T3), and after sternal closure (T4). Before&#xD;
      induction of anesthesia, an NIRS sensor (INVOS® 5100C Cerebral/Somatic Oximeter; Medtronic,&#xD;
      Minneapolis, MN, USA) was placed on the thenar eminence and an automated tourniquet (A.T.S®&#xD;
      3000 Automatic Tourniquet System; Zimmer Inc., Warsaw, IL, USA) was placed around the upper&#xD;
      arm. The arterial catheter was placed in the contralateral radial artery and the baseline&#xD;
      blood pressure was measured. When the baseline tissue oxygen saturation (StO2) was&#xD;
      stabilized, the automatic tourniquet was inflated to 50 mmHg over the patient's baseline&#xD;
      systolic blood pressure and maintained for 5 min. After the 5-min ischemic period, the&#xD;
      tourniquet rapidly deflated to 0 mmHg. StO2 data were continuously recorded during the VOT&#xD;
      procedure. Baseline StO2, minimum StO2 during the 5-min inflation of the tourniquet, and&#xD;
      maximum StO2 during deflation of the tourniquet were obtained. The occlusion slope and&#xD;
      recovery slope were calculated based on the measured StO2 data. The occlusion slope, which is&#xD;
      related to oxygen extraction, was defined as the slope of the StO2 descent to the lowest&#xD;
      value. The recovery slope, which is related to microvascular reactivity, was calculated from&#xD;
      the deflation of the tourniquet until the recovery of StO2 to the highest value.&#xD;
