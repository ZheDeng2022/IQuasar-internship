  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Extreme preterm infants (GA ≤ 28+6 weeks) are at high risk for bronchopulmonary dysplasia&#xD;
      (BPD) that has been associated with significant long-term impairment. Lung ultrasound score&#xD;
      (LUSs) has the potential to early identify infants at high risk of developing BPD who may&#xD;
      benefit from early intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To assess if LUS score can be utilized to predict the development of BPD in infants born&#xD;
      at ≤ 28+6 weeks, early in their postnatal course, when the disease is likely to be most&#xD;
      amenable to therapeutic intervention.&#xD;

      Background and Importance: Despite advances in neonatal care and improved survival among&#xD;
      immature infants, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) remained a serious complication among&#xD;
      preterm neonates born at &lt;29 weeks' gestational age. A variety of therapies including&#xD;
      antenatal steroid, surfactant administration, high-frequency ventilation, postnatal steroid&#xD;
      (systemic and inhaled), and vitamin A supplementation have been studied as means to prevent&#xD;
      BPD. Ideally, interventional studies aim to prevent or reduce BPD should include criteria for&#xD;
      selecting infants at highest risk for BPD while excluding infants at low risk. Recently, Lung&#xD;
      ultrasound severity score (LUSs) has shown in few studies to be a promising tool for&#xD;
      assessing lung aeration and for early prediction of preterm infants with evolving BPD. These&#xD;
      studies have a major limitation as it includes infants at low risk for BPD (&gt; 28 weeks&#xD;
      gestational age). In this study, we will assess the accuracy of LUSs for early identification&#xD;
      BPD among extreme preterm infants born at &lt;29 weeks' GA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedure In this prospective observational study, our aim is to recruit a large cohort&#xD;
      of extreme premature neonates (born at ≤ 28+6 weeks gestational age), and sequentially&#xD;
      perform an &quot;early-diagnostic assessments &quot;on day 3 of age. Subsequent LUS assessment will be&#xD;
      performed at 7 days (+/- 1 day) of age and the third LUS assessment will be at 14 (+/-2 days&#xD;
      of age). Assessment will be done in the same manner as described by Cattarossi et.al.&#xD;
      Basically, each lung will be divided into 3 zones (upper anterior, lower anterior, and&#xD;
      lateral) and will be examined using a L20 linear probe to perform a longitudinal lung scan&#xD;
      (Fig 1). Additionally, we will score each zone (score 0-to 3 points) according to the&#xD;
      modified LUS score by Brat et.al [20]. Based on the LUS pattern in each lung zone the total&#xD;
      score can range from 0 to 18 for the 6 zones of both lungs. As summarized in figure 2 the LUS&#xD;
      score will include signs that can be used to diagnose TTN, RDS or identify early changes of&#xD;
      BPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will record this data for babies enrolled in the study, along with their relevant medical&#xD;
      data. At the end of this study, we will divide the cohort into those who developed BPD and&#xD;
      those who did not as per currently used standard criteria and will compare the results of new&#xD;
      LUS severity score obtained at earlier time points. Prediction models will be created&#xD;
      including variables associated with BPD development at each time point with and without&#xD;
      inclusion of lung US severity score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding LUS assessment a Zonare Ultrasound machine (Z.One PRO ultrasound) with a&#xD;
      high-frequency (L20-5) linear probe will be used. This high-frequency probe gives excellent&#xD;
      resolution and adequate penetration in these small infants. We decided to start LUS scanning&#xD;
      at day 3 of age as most of these babies are at risk for intraventricular hemorrhage and&#xD;
      minimal handling especially during the first 3 days is highly recommended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All LUS assessments will be undertaken at the same time using a standard aseptic technique&#xD;
      and without too much handling of the infants. Approval will be obtained from the Research&#xD;
      Ethics Board (REB) at Sinai Health System and Health sciences Centre-Winnipeg. Parents will&#xD;
      be approached for consent before enrollment.&#xD;
