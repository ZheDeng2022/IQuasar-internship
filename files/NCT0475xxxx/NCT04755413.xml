  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) have narrow or blocked arteries that supply blood&#xD;
      to the heart. Reduced blood flow to the heart muscle from CAD can cause chest pain or aching,&#xD;
      especially with exercise or activity. CAD can lead to weakening of the heart muscle or heart&#xD;
      failure, and a higher risk of heart attack or death. Certain proteins in the blood, known as&#xD;
      biomarkers, can be found in people with CAD. Higher levels of these biomarkers are associated&#xD;
      with a greater risk of complications from CAD. The purpose of this study is to see if a&#xD;
      customized treatment based on biomarkers will reduce the biomarker levels and lead to lower&#xD;
      risk of complications from CAD.&#xD;

      People with Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) have narrow or blocked arteries that supply blood&#xD;
      to the heart. Reduced blood flow to the heart muscle from CAD can cause chest pain or aching,&#xD;
      especially with exercise or activity. CAD can lead to weakening of the heart muscle or heart&#xD;
      failure, and a higher risk of heart attack or death. Certain proteins in the blood, known as&#xD;
      biomarkers, can be found in people with CAD. Higher levels of these biomarkers are associated&#xD;
      with a greater risk of complications from CAD. The purpose of this study is to see if a&#xD;
      customized treatment based on biomarkers will reduce the biomarker levels and lead to lower&#xD;
      risk of complications from CAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with high biomarker levels will be randomly assigned (like flipping a coin) to&#xD;
      either the treatment group or usual care. Both groups will have physical exams, blood tests,&#xD;
      and answer questionnaires. Participants in the treatment group will have their medications&#xD;
      adjusted based on their biomarker levels. They will also be asked to make lifestyle changes&#xD;
      like diet, exercise, and quitting smoking. Participants in the usual care group will receive&#xD;
      the standard of care prescribed by their doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will take place in research rooms at Emory University Hospital and the Woodruff&#xD;
      Memorial Research Building.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be paid for being in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited from Emory Healthcare outpatient cardiology clinics and cath&#xD;
      labs. Participants will be identified through the medical record and by their doctors.&#xD;
      Written consent will be obtained from Participants before they can join the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study data and blood samples will be collected and banked for possible research in the&#xD;
      future. These may also be shared with other researchers including researchers outside of&#xD;
      Emory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will advance scientific knowledge and benefit human health by giving us more&#xD;
      treatment options for CAD.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Biomarker Risk Score (BRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 year post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The BRS score is a simple and manual observation of 4 biomarker results above a predetermined cutpoint that are run on FDA cleared and or CE marked platforms. The BRS is calculated using levels of the 4 biomarkers. Biomarker levels will be considered abnormal if hsCRP is &gt;3 mg/L, suPAR (pg/mL) &gt;2863 (males) and &gt;4063 (women), hs-TnI (pg/mL)&gt; 6.3 (men), &gt;5.5 (women), and BNP (pg/mL) &gt;122 (men), &gt;184.1 (women). The BRS ranges from 0 to 4 based on the number of biomarkers that are elevated above these cut off values. Higher score correlates with worse outcome.</description>
