    <textblock>
      This research was conducted to determine the effect of virtual reality-supported&#xD;
      hypnofertility on fertility preparedness, stress and coping with stress in women having in&#xD;
      vitro fertilization. At the end of research It has been determined that initiatives based on&#xD;
      the hypnofertility philosophy increase the level of preparedness to fertility, decrease the&#xD;
      stress level and provide effective coping with stress in women who had IVF treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is estimated that the infertility affects 8-12% of all couples in reproductive age across&#xD;
      the world. Various alternative methods were implemented for years for alleviating the stress&#xD;
      which was felt by infertile women. The women in the process of infertility treatment make&#xD;
      more efforts to be impregnated, their fertility preparedness is negatively affected and they&#xD;
      need more psychosocial support. Upon the review of the relevant literature, it is discerned&#xD;
      that there was a limited number of studies in which mind-body programs, namely,&#xD;
      hypnofertility methods, were applied to the cases of infertility. In this research, in the&#xD;
      first meeting with infertile women who would be assigned to the experimental group, the&#xD;
      research objective was explained, and their consent to partake in the research was received&#xD;
      in written and verbal format and pretest data were obtained. Later during in vitro&#xD;
      fertilization, VR-supported hypnofertility treatment initiative which applied to the&#xD;
      experimental group was implemented in four stages, namely, 'Stage 1 (the first folliculometry&#xD;
      day)', 'Stage 2 (the second folliculometry day)', 'Stage 3 (oocyte retrieval stage)' and&#xD;
      'Stage 4 (embryo transfer stage)'. And posttest data were obtained at the end of last stage.&#xD;
      Each process took 20 minutes on average. Meetings with infertile women who were assigned to&#xD;
      the control group were held twice. In the first meeting, pretest data were collected.&#xD;
      VR-supported hypnofertility treatment initiative was not applied to the control group, and&#xD;
      posttest data were collected from the control group via the second meeting held on the same&#xD;
      date as the fourth stage of treatment, namely, the day of embryo transfer. It is considered&#xD;
      that the stress levels of women who are in the process of having IVF treatment will fall down&#xD;
      and hence the fertility preparedness and the ability to cope with infertility stress will be&#xD;
      positively affected by virtue of the effective use of hypnofertility method, which is still a&#xD;
      new method in Turkey, by midwives and other health professionals.&#xD;

    <measure>Fertility Preparedness Scale for Women Receiving Fertility Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 12</time_frame>
    <description>The scale is used for the assessment of the levels of stress experienced by infertile couples. As a Likert-type scale, it has three sub-scales in relation to personal, marital and social domains and contains a total of 14 items. 'Stress in personal domain' sub-scale contains six items, and the minimum and maximum scores to be obtained from it are successively 0 and 20 points. 'Stress in marital domain' sub-scale has four items, and the minimum and maximum scores to be obtained from it are successively 0 and 14 points. 'Stress in social domain' sub-scale is comprised of four items, and the minimum and maximum scores to be obtained from it are successively 0 and 12 points. A high score to be obtained from the sub-scale refers to the increase in the stress level.</description>

    <measure>The Copenhagen Multi-centre Psychosocial Infertility Coping Strategy Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 12</time_frame>
    <description>The scale contains 19 items and has four sub-scales. The minimum and maximum scores to be obtained from the sub-scale of 'active-avoidance' coping method which is comprised of four items are successively 4 and 16 points. The sub-scale of 'active-confronting' coping method contains seven items. The minimum and maximum scores to be obtained from this sub-scale are successively 7 and 26 points. The minimum and maximum scores to be obtained from the sub-scale of 'passive-avoidance' coping method which is comprised of three items are successively 3 and 12 points. The sub-scale of 'meaning-based' coping method contains five items. The minimum and maximum scores to be obtained from this sub-scale are successively 5 and 20 points. A higher score to be obtained from the subscale means that the method is used more when coping with with stress.</description>
