      This is a phase 1, open-label, multicenter, single-dose, single-period, sequential study with&#xD;
      the primary objective of determining the effect of moderate and mild hepatic impairment on&#xD;
      the PK of surufatinib. The secondary objective is to evaluate the safety in subjects with&#xD;
      moderate and mild (if enrolled) hepatic impairment and subjects with normal hepatic function.&#xD;
