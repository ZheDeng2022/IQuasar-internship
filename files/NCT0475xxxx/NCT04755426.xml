  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this study is to develop and validate a preference assessment tool for&#xD;
      patients who have severe aortic stenosis and are contemplating their treatment options. The&#xD;
      first part of the study focuses on understanding the treatment goals and treatment features&#xD;
      that matter most to patients who have already made the decision. The investigators use mixed&#xD;
      methods (nominal group technique, card sorting) to elicit, prioritize, and organize these&#xD;
      patient preferences into a &quot;cognitive map&quot;. Based on those findings, the investigators design&#xD;
      a preference tool and then pre-test the tool with patients and healthcare providers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are conducting a 4-phase phase mixed methods study involving nominal group&#xD;
      technique (NGT), with patients driving the identification and categorization of preferences&#xD;
      regarding treatment options for symptomatic AS. Participants include adults with a history of&#xD;
      symptomatic AS and HCPs who guide decisions about managing AS, including interventional&#xD;
      cardiologists, cardiac surgeons and advanced practice providers (APPs), including nurse&#xD;
      practitioners and physician assistants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial phases of the study (generating patient goals and preferences through NGTs)&#xD;
      targets diverse patients with a history of severe Aortic Stenosis (AS) who have previously&#xD;
      made the decision regarding treatment choices. This will include patients who have undergone&#xD;
      Surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR), Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), or&#xD;
      who elected palliative care with or without balloon valvuloplasty. The subsequent phases will&#xD;
      include patients with AS who are currently facing a decision with regard to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1: Identify and prioritize patient a) goals and b) preferences for treatment. The&#xD;
      nominal group technique (NGT) will be used to identify and prioritize patient-centered&#xD;
      outcomes related to treatment goals and treatment features. Both in-person and online NGT&#xD;
      groups, with 5-9 patients each, will be conducted to maximize the representativeness of the&#xD;
      sample (6-8 NGTs). Planning for 4 NGT's per question (8 total), including a minimum of 2&#xD;
      in-person NGTs (and the remaining conducted either in-person or online, depending on which&#xD;
      approach better enables recruitment needs. Each NGT has between 5 and 9 patients. A separate&#xD;
      parallel process will be done for each NGT question including a) goals and b) preferences for&#xD;
      treatment attributes to limit patient burden for each portion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: Categorize patient a) goals and b) preferences for treatment through cognitive&#xD;
      mapping. Following identification and prioritization of patient-generated goals and&#xD;
      preferences, 25-50 patients across the three sites will participate online in &quot;card sorting&quot;&#xD;
      activities that will be used to organize these prioritized lists into clusters (domains),&#xD;
      using Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) and Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) to analyze the&#xD;
      data. A parallel process will be done for each cognitive map including a) goals and b)&#xD;
      preferences for treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3: Based on patient-defined goals and preferences for the treatment of AS, develop the&#xD;
      preference assessment tool. The patient-identified goals and preferences will serve as the&#xD;
      core of the preference tool. The investigators will draw from a validated SDM template to&#xD;
      summarize and communicate patient preferences to their HCPs. An early prototype will be&#xD;
      developed, and subsequent usability testing with patients with a history of severe AS will&#xD;
      refine the tool. The prototype that will be used is available at:&#xD;
      https://tinyurl.com/WhatMattersMS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 4: Pilot test the preference assessment tool using 20-25 patient-HCP pairs to compare&#xD;
      HCPs' prediction of patient preferences to actual patient preferences, among those patients&#xD;
      who have not yet received treatment for their AS. Before each clinical encounter, each HCP&#xD;
      will be asked to infer their patient's top 1-3 treatment goals and preferences. Patients will&#xD;
      have interacted with the preference assessment tool independently before the clinical&#xD;
      appointment, which will have assessed and summarized their goals and preferences. After the&#xD;
      HCP has entered his/her inferred patient treatment goals, he/she will be shown the patient's&#xD;
      actual treatment goals and preferences. Analyses will compare the correspondence between the&#xD;
      patient and HCP preferences (using Kappa statistic). Additionally, the outcomes below will be&#xD;
      assessed in preparation for the subsequent national validation study.&#xD;
