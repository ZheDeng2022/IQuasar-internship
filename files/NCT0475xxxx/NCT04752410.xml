  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brachial plexus block (BPB) is frequently used as the sole anesthetic technique for upper&#xD;
      extremity surgery. The choice of technique often depends on the site of surgery because the&#xD;
      extent of sensory-motor blockade after a BPB varies with the technique used. The investigator&#xD;
      is not aware of any single BPB technique described to date that can consistently produce&#xD;
      surgical anesthesia of the whole ipsilateral upper extremity. However, occasionally surgery&#xD;
      entails that the whole upper extremity, i.e. from the shoulder to the elbow, or even the&#xD;
      forearm, wrist or hands. This clinical challenge has been addressed previously using a&#xD;
      combination of BPB techniques. The investigator has recently demonstrated that it is feasible&#xD;
      to accurately identify majority of the main components of the brachial plexus above the&#xD;
      clavicle, including the three trunks, using ultrasound imaging. Since majority of the&#xD;
      innervation of the upper extremity, i.e. shoulder, arm, elbow, forearm, wrist and hand,&#xD;
      originates from the three trunks of the brachial plexus, the investigator hypothesized that&#xD;
      selectively blocking upper, middle, and inferior trunks of the brachial plexus will produce&#xD;
      surgical anesthesia of the whole ipsilateral upper extremity. This study is a continuation of&#xD;
      a previously approved study with title &quot;Selective Trunk Brachial Plexus Block: A Prospective&#xD;
      Non-Randomized Study of Intervention&quot; [NCT04510259] after the amendment (study title,&#xD;
      protocol and increased sample size) was rejected by local IRB and suggested to submit as a&#xD;
      new protocol. The aim of this study is to assess a novel brachial plexus block technique, the&#xD;
      selective trunk block (SeTB), and provide preliminary clinical evidence of its effectiveness&#xD;
      in producing surgical anesthesia of the whole ipsilateral upper extremity.&#xD;

      Brachial plexus block (BPB) is frequently used as the sole anesthetic technique for upper&#xD;
      extremity surgery. The choice of technique often depends on the site of surgery because the&#xD;
      extent of sensory-motor blockade after a BPB varies with the technique used. The investigator&#xD;
      is not aware of any single BPB technique described to date that can consistently produce&#xD;
      surgical anesthesia of the whole ipsilateral upper extremity (shoulder to fingers). However,&#xD;
      occasionally surgery entails that the whole upper extremity is anesthetized, i.e. from the&#xD;
      shoulder to the elbow, or even the forearm, wrist or hands. This clinical challenge has been&#xD;
      addressed previously using a combination of BPB (hybrid) techniques. The investigator has&#xD;
      recently demonstrated that it is feasible to accurately identify majority of the individual&#xD;
      components of the brachial plexus above the clavicle, including the three trunks, using&#xD;
      ultrasound imaging. Since majority of the innervation of the upper extremity, i.e. shoulder,&#xD;
      arm, elbow, forearm, wrist and hand, originates from or pass through the three trunks of the&#xD;
      brachial plexus, the investigator hypothesized that selectively blocking the upper, middle,&#xD;
      and inferior trunks of the brachial plexus will produce surgical anesthesia of the whole&#xD;
      ipsilateral upper extremity, except for the area innervated by the intercostobrachial nerve&#xD;
      (T2 - medial aspect of the upper arm). The investigator refers this novel technique as&#xD;
      &quot;selective trunk block&quot; (SeTB). Currently there are no published data on block dynamics,&#xD;
      safety or efficacy of SeTB. In addition, there may be a potential advantage that phrenic&#xD;
      nerve can be spared, so this blockade will not affect the respiratory function as it is&#xD;
      common to see phrenic nerve palsy after interscalene BPB (100%) and supraclavicular BPB&#xD;
      (50-67%). This study is a continuation of a previously approved study with title &quot;Selective&#xD;
      Trunk Brachial Plexus Block: A Prospective Non-Randomized Study of Intervention&quot;&#xD;
      [NCT04510259] after the amendment (study title, protocol and increased sample size) was&#xD;
      rejected by local IRB and suggested to submit as a new protocol. The aim of this study is to&#xD;
      assess a novel brachial plexus block technique, the selective trunk block (SeTB), and provide&#xD;
      preliminary clinical evidence of its effectiveness in producing surgical anesthesia of the&#xD;
      whole ipsilateral upper extremity.&#xD;

    <measure>Changes of sensory block of the upper extremity</measure>
    <time_frame>within 45 minutes after the block at 5 minutes interval</time_frame>
    <description>Sensation to coldness (ice) will be tested at the median (lateral three and half digits on the palmar side), radial (dorsal side of hand), ulnar (medial one and a half digits), musculocutaneous (lateral side of the forearm) and axillary (skin over the lower deltoid) and graded using a verbal rating scale (VRS:0-100, 100=normal sensation, 0=no sensation). Onset of sensory block for each nerve will be defined as the time that it took to achieve a sensory block score of =&lt;30.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes of motor block of the upper extremity</measure>
    <time_frame>within 45 minutes after the block at 5 minutes interval</time_frame>
    <description>Motor blockade will be graded using a 3-points scale revising from previous study: 2=no block, 1=paresis and 0=paralysis. Motor blockade of each individual nerve in the anesthetized upper extremity will be evaluated by testing for opposition of thumb with the index finger (median nerve), wrist extension (radial nerve), thumb opposition with little finger (ulnar nerve), elbow flexion (musculocutaneous nerve) abduction of shoulder (axillary nerve), and external rotation of the arm with elbow flexed and simulate emptying a can motion and test for power against resistance (Suprascapular nerve). The onset of motor block for each nerve will be defined as motor grading at each nerve =&lt;1. Complete block will be defined as a sensory and motor block score of '0' in all nerves functions.</description>

    <description>overall sensory scores =&lt;30 (VRS: 0-100, 100=normal sensation, 0=no sensation) and motor score =&lt;1 (3-points scale, 2=no block, 1=paresis, 0=paralysis) in all the nerves tested.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes of the Diaphragmatic function</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (before brachial plexus block) and at 30 minutes after block</time_frame>
    <description>Excursion of the right hemidiaphragm will be measured by ultrasound machine in supine position via the anterior subcostal route. The movement of the diaphragm will be measured in centimetres. The range of diaphragmatic excursion will be recorded from the resting expiratory position to deep inspiration (sigh test) as will be range of diaphragmatic movement from resting expiratory position when quickly inspiring through the nose (sniff test). The decrease in diaphragmatic excursion will be calculated as the difference (in percentage) in diaphragmatic excursion measured before and 30 minutes after SeTB. Reduction in diaphragmatic excursion of more than 75% of baseline, or no movement, or paradoxical movement will be considered as complete paresis. Reduction in diaphragmatic excursion of between 25% and 75% will be considered as partial paresis and diaphragmatic excursion of less than 25% will be considered as 'no paresis'.</description>
