  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension is one of the major risk factor for global mortality. Approximately half of 17&#xD;
      million cardiovascular deaths worldwide are accounted for HTN. Multiple research for&#xD;
      cost-effective medication for management of hypertension is going on. An effective&#xD;
      alternative to medications in managing hypertension is through lifestyle modifications.&#xD;
      Adopting healthy diet is a valuable strategy. Randomized controlled year-long trials observed&#xD;
      impressive reductions in blood pressure in patients with hypertension consuming flaxseed&#xD;
      daily. Therefore, attention has been garnered for flaxseed as a potentially valuable strategy&#xD;
      for the management of hypertension. Double blinded, 2 parallel-group, prospective&#xD;
      interventional randomized clinical trial. Investigators are planning to conduct most common&#xD;
      and basic method of randomization i.e,&quot;lottery method&quot;. This is most popular method and&#xD;
      simplest method. In this method both Interventional and Placebo groups are numbered on&#xD;
      separate slips of paper of same size, shape and color. They are folded and mixed up in a drum&#xD;
      or a box or a container. A blindfold selection is made. Required numbers of slips are&#xD;
      selected for the desired sample size. The selection of items thus depends on chance. The&#xD;
      respective groups are then allocated in a sequence as Code A and Code B that will be&#xD;
      concealed from the researcher (JR) enrolling and assessing participants in sequentially&#xD;
      numbered, opaque, sealed and stapled envelope. After getting clearance from IRC,&#xD;
      randomization will be done where Interventional and placebo groups will be given Flaxseed&#xD;
      Capsule 500 mg and Look-alike(Placebo) Capsule with no therapeutic effect respectively twice&#xD;
      a day along with equivalent anti-hypertensive drugs in Medicine OPD,BPKIHS. Blood pressure of&#xD;
      all the enrolled subjects will be taken on first day of enrollment before start of&#xD;
      intervention. After which subjects will be given respective capsules for first 30 days then&#xD;
      follow-up. Assigned with respective arms,subjects will be followed up on 90th day. The&#xD;
      proforma which includes patient's sociodemographic data,BP value,Adverse Drug reactions and&#xD;
      drug interactions will be filled and data will be entered in MS-Excel subsequently and SPSS&#xD;
      v11.5 will be used for further analysis. Investigators are planning to conduct a clinical&#xD;
      trial in between 2 groups using power and sample size programme. Investigators need to enroll&#xD;
      36 subjects in each group, to be able to reject null hypothesis that means of two different&#xD;
      groups are equal with probability of power 95% and at 5% level of significance. Hence sample&#xD;
      size is taken 36 in each group. 10% increment will be done in each group if the subject will&#xD;
      not come for follow up. Clinically diagnosed hypertension attending medicine OPD, BPKIHS,&#xD;
      Dharan, satisfying the inclusion and exclusion criteria and willing to participate in the&#xD;
      study will be enrolled. Prior to the conduction of the study ,ethical clearance will be&#xD;
      obtained from the Institutional Review Committee(IRC) of BPKIHS and the clinical trial will&#xD;
      be registered. Precaution will also be taken as far as possible to avoid pain and suffering&#xD;
      and side effects of the medication to the subjects during the course of the study.&#xD;
