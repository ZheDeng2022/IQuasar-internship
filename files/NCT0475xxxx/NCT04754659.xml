      This randomized controlled trial aim to determine the impact on renal function after&#xD;
      treatment for infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm with stentgrafts either with active supra-&#xD;
      or infrarenal fixation. Individuals are planned to be included throughout Scandinavia. After&#xD;
      inclusion in the study, baseline data is collected and computerized randomization between the&#xD;
      two stent graft fixation types is performed. Follow-up will be scheduled after 1 month and&#xD;
      1,3 and 5 years. Analyses of blood samples to determine renal function are undertaken&#xD;
      together with CT scans to detect stentgraft performance at all follow-up visits alongside&#xD;
      assessments of health-related quality of life questionnaires.&#xD;
