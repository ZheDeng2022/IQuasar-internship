  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an early feasibility trial to determine whether transcutaneous neuromuscular&#xD;
      electrical stimulation, with or without transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation, using an&#xD;
      investigational neurostimulation device improves functional arm/hand movements in individuals&#xD;
      with paralysis or paresis due to a spinal cord injury or stroke and improves functional&#xD;
      arm/hand or leg/foot movements in individuals with paralysis or paresis due to other brain or&#xD;
      nerve injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, eligible individuals that agree to participate will be asked to attend up to 5&#xD;
      study sessions a week for 1 year (depending on participant availability), with each session&#xD;
      lasting up to 4 hours. At the first study session, participants will have their demographic&#xD;
      information collected, vital signs assessed, and have measurements performed of their limbs&#xD;
      and torso, as appropriate. They will also undergo clinical evaluations and tests to assess&#xD;
      their current functional movement and sensation capabilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During subsequent study sessions, participants will undergo many tasks designed to improve&#xD;
      functional movements in paralyzed limbs. Specifically, participants will receive&#xD;
      neuromuscular electrical stimulation to the limb(s) and/or electrical stimulation to the&#xD;
      spinal cord to evoke specified movements. The stimulation parameters and locations on the&#xD;
      spinal column and/or limb(s) that evoke specific movements will be noted. The movements will&#xD;
      be assessed with visual inspection, electromyography, and/or sensors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical evaluations and tests to assess functional movement and sensation capabilities&#xD;
      will be repeated throughout the study and at the last study session to assess for functional&#xD;
      improvements compared to the first study session. Upon completion of these study sessions,&#xD;
      the individual's participation in the study is considered complete.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During study sessions, both neuromuscular and spinal cord stimulation will first be manually&#xD;
      administered to properly map the area in relation to intended movements. Once mapping for&#xD;
      placement is completed, the study team will proceed with administering electrical stimulation&#xD;
      with the investigational stimulator to evoke specific movements. In order to facilitate the&#xD;
      connectivity of these electrodes with the skin, electroconductive gels, lotions, creams, and&#xD;
      sold hydrogels may be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The improvement of the precision, specificity, and extent of functional movements over the&#xD;
      course of focused electrical stimulation sessions for various electrical stimulation&#xD;
      amplitudes at key locations will be assessed visually and through electromyography. The grip&#xD;
      strength and evoked pressures at the limbs will also be measured using sensors placed at&#xD;
      those locations. The specificity and quantification of the various movements will be assessed&#xD;
      with a motion tracking device as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will use the following clinical tests and graded tasks, as needed, to assess&#xD;
      changes in functional movement over time: Range of Movement Evaluation; Spasticity Reduction&#xD;
      Evaluation; Sensory Perception Evaluation; Graded Redefined Assessment of Strength,&#xD;
      Sensibility, and Prehension; Jebsen-Taylor Test; Action Research Arm Test; Chedoke Arm and&#xD;
      Hand Activity Inventory; Chedoke-McMaster Stroke Scale; Wolf Motor Function Test; Just&#xD;
      Noticeable Weight Test; Grip Strength / Finger Strength Assessments; Fugl-Meyer Assessment;&#xD;
      Stroke Rehabilitation Assessment of Movement; and Object Transfer Tests (including 9-Hole Peg&#xD;
      &amp; Cup/Cone/Ball Transfer). All of these tests and exams have been validated, and involve&#xD;
      participants performing simple movement tasks or identifying a physical sensation.&#xD;
