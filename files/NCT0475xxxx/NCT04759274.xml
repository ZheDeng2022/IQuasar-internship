      This purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of a mobile phone application in&#xD;
      helping to control body swelling in patients with kidney problems. The application will help&#xD;
      in the day to day adjustments in diuretic medication dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this study will have an application loaded on to their mobile phone by the&#xD;
      study team and be taught how to use it over a 2 hour visit. Participants will need to check&#xD;
      their blood pressure and weight daily and enter this information into the mobile phone&#xD;
      application every day. Participants will need to follow daily instructions in their&#xD;
      medication dosing provided by the application. There will be periodic blood testing. This&#xD;
      will happen at 2 weeks, 90 days, and up to 4 other times if necessary. At the end of the&#xD;
      study there is a 2 hour study visit during which participants will answer a survey. The total&#xD;
      length of the study is 90 days.&#xD;

      Study Population: 30 subjects with signs of hypervolemia and either nephrotic syndrome or&#xD;
      chronic kidney disease 4 to 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Intervention: This is a nonrandomized, uncontrolled trial. The Diuretic Tuner mobile&#xD;
      device application will be deployed in the care of hypervolemic subjects as defined in the&#xD;
      study population. The Diuretic Tuner will integrate each subject's estimated dry weight and&#xD;
      starting diuretic dose (both defined by healthcare provider) with daily weights and blood&#xD;
      pressures to provide individualized guidance to the subject in day-to-day adjustments to his&#xD;
      or her diuretic regimen. In addition, the application will generate a diary of daily weights,&#xD;
      blood pressures, fluid intake, and medication compliance. There will be no control arm as&#xD;
      this first phase is to test feasibility/safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Outcome Measures: The primary outcomes of interest will focus on the achievement of the&#xD;
      provider-defined estimated dry weight (both the time to achieving this target as well as the&#xD;
      subsequent stability in weights around this target). Secondary outcomes of interest include&#xD;
      safety metrics (3-month hospitalization rates, rates of hypokalemia, and rates of acute&#xD;
      kidney injury) and tool usability (assessed through surveys evaluating ease of comprehension&#xD;
      and satisfaction).&#xD;
