      The study will be carried out in Surgical Unit-III, Lahore General Hospital. It will be a&#xD;
      randomized control trial. Patients undergoing surgery for Ileostomy were randomly divided&#xD;
      into two groups, Group-A (Purse-string closure) and Group-B (Conventional primary closure).&#xD;
      All the patients will be called for follow-up checkup on 14th days after operation and after&#xD;
      one month. Both of the groups will be checked and recorded for SSI after operation and&#xD;
      hospital stay. The data will be statistically analyzed by using SPSS v23.0.t test&#xD;
      (independent sample) used for the comparison of hospital stay mean. Chi-square will also used&#xD;
      for the comparison of the frequencies of SSI. Data were stratified for gender and age. A&#xD;
      p-value â‰¤0.05 will be considered as significant.&#xD;
