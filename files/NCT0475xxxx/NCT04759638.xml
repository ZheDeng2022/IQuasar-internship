  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a controversy regarding the effect of the two Body Mass Index (BMI) extremes on the&#xD;
      oncological outcome of rectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The obesity paradox appears to exist in rectal cancer patients treated with nCRT and surgery,&#xD;
      as it was associated with significantly higher rates of pathological complete response and R0&#xD;
      resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Underweight patients were at higher risk for anastomotic leak and R1 resection.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obesity and underweight are associated with increased risk of postoperative morbidity in&#xD;
      colorectal cancer patients undergoing surgery. There is a controversy regarding the effect of&#xD;
      the two Body Mass Index (BMI) extremes on the oncological outcome of rectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of BMI on short- and long-term oncological&#xD;
      outcomes as well as postoperative complications in rectal cancer patients who received&#xD;
      neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) followed by surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tertiary Cancer Center serving pediatric and adult patients in Jordan and the Middle East.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The medical records of patients with stage II-III rectal cancer who received nCRT followed by&#xD;
      surgery during 2006 to 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. The patients were subdivided&#xD;
      according to their BMI into less than 20 kg/m2 defined as underweight; between 20 to 30 kg/m2&#xD;
      defined as normal range weight, above 30 kg/m2 defined as obese.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disease-Free Survival (DFS), Overall Survival, Pathological Complete Response (CR)&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who underwent rectal surgery at King Hussein Cancer Center (KHCC) from 2006&#xD;
             to 2018 were identified. Those with locally advanced rectal cancer (stages II and III)&#xD;
             who underwent nCRT followed by surgery with curative intent were included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with early rectal cancer (stage I) who did not require nCRT and those who&#xD;
             underwent rectal surgery as part of a staged or simultaneous approach for metastatic&#xD;
             disease (stage IV) were excluded.&#xD;
