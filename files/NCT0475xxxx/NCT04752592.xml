  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The performance of a new triage test for active tuberculosis (TB), SeroSelectTB, will be&#xD;
      qualified in multi-centre randomised controlled trials at health-posts in South Africa,&#xD;
      Tanzania and Ethiopia. Cost effectiveness evaluations will be conducted to support a value&#xD;
      proposition to stakeholders and regulatory authorities, and to support commercialization&#xD;
      requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consenting adults will provide blood and saliva samples for screening by SeroSelectTB, and&#xD;
      sputum collected for routine TB diagnosis by the health services. Clinical and&#xD;
      sociodemographic information will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A reliable rapid test will make it possible to identify and selectively treat those with&#xD;
      active TB at the local healthcare level. The expected impact includes accurate same-day&#xD;
      diagnosis of patients with active TB, reduction of diagnostic delay and TB transmission, and&#xD;
      diagnostic cost-savings for patients and healthcare systems in high TB-burden countries.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: Worldwide over 15 million persons live with active TB. While the prevalence of&#xD;
      latent TB is very high, only disease, and not latent infection, is treated in most high&#xD;
      burdened countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A rapid triage test for detection of active TB, which can identify symptomatic individuals&#xD;
      who require confirmatory diagnostic investigation, is a global priority for TB control. A&#xD;
      rapid triage test can drastically reduce the burden on health systems and patients, and&#xD;
      reduce diagnostic delay by expediting referral, confirmatory testing and timely commencement&#xD;
      of adequate treatment. Triage tests, which may utilise point- of-care rapid lateral flow (LF)&#xD;
      platforms, offer a promising alternative to conventional methods for TB diagnosis (i.e. smear&#xD;
      microscopy and culture). However, the lack of accurate TB biomarkers has stalled the&#xD;
      development of serological assays that meet the World Health Organization (WHO)-defined&#xD;
      criteria for a triage test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As an alternative, a rapid molecular diagnostic tool, maned Xpert and Xpert Ultra MTB/RIF,&#xD;
      which accurately detects active TB, has been introduced in many countries as a replacement&#xD;
      for smear microscopy and culture. However, Xpert/Ultra is not suited for use at health-posts&#xD;
      without electricity or laboratory facilities, where the majority of patients present. In&#xD;
      addition, the affordability of scaling-up Xpert is of concern in high TB-burden countries,&#xD;
      where it could consume 20-80% of national TB budgets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, to control the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistant TB in a cost-effective&#xD;
      manner, there is an urgent need for a rapid, inexpensive triage test that can detect active&#xD;
      TB at health-posts level and expedite referral to facilities supporting molecular&#xD;
      diagnostics. An ideal cost-effective triage test should be as sensitive as Xpert and cost&#xD;
      less than US $5 to reduce total diagnostic costs by 30-40%, potentially saving national TB&#xD;
      programmes US $36 million/year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected outcome of this project, the implementation of a triage test that will detect&#xD;
      active TB at a low diagnostic cost, and expedite persons with TB-indicative symptoms to&#xD;
      centralized healthcare facilities, will be beneficial irrespective of age and gender of&#xD;
      patients. In addition, SeroSelectTB is sensitive among adults co- infected with TB/HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective of field trial is to evaluate the diagnostic delay, measured as the time&#xD;
      from TB diagnostic to TB treatment initiation between two groups of patients: those who were&#xD;
      screened with SeroSelectTB triage test compared to patients who received the standard of&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Persons with reactive SeroSelectTB test results will be referred for same-day confirmatory&#xD;
      Xpert testing and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe SeroSelectTB performance in field conditions, including sensitivity and&#xD;
           specificity, positive and negative predictive values in the study populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collect blood and saliva samples from all consenting participants and create national&#xD;
           biobanks, which will facilitate biological samples exchange and sharing with third&#xD;
           parties for future research.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the added-value of using SeroSelectTB in healthcare systems in South Africa,&#xD;
           Tanzania and Ethiopia through cost-effectiveness evaluation and inform international and&#xD;
           national TB prevention programmes stakeholders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: This is an interventional, a multi-centre, two parallel-group, randomised,&#xD;
      controlled field trial conducted in three countries: The South African Republic, United&#xD;
      Republic of Tanzania, and Republic of Ethiopia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the interventional arm participants will be screened using SeroSelectTB rapid triage test,&#xD;
      and in the case of positive SeroSelectTB test results, will be referred to TB confirmation&#xD;
      diagnostics at the referral centre where TB diagnosis will be confirmed by Xpert/Ultra&#xD;
      molecular diagnostics. In the standard of care arm patients will receive usual TB&#xD;
      diagnostics: microbiology (culture-confirmed diagnostics) and/or microscopy (sputum&#xD;
      smear-based diagnostics).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At inclusion, participants will be blinded to which diagnostic arm they are randomized:&#xD;
      SeroSelectTB or standard of care arm. Healthcare workers performing the diagnostic test will&#xD;
      not be blinded since it is unattainable to conceal if they are performing a&#xD;
      microscopy/culture-based diagnostics or hand-held SeroSelectTB test. Lab technicians at&#xD;
      Lateral Flow Laboratories, South Africa, and the National Institute of Health and the&#xD;
      Environment (RIVM), the Netherlands will be blinded to patients' allocation when performing&#xD;
      quality control analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment strategy and retention: An information leaflet and booklet addressing 'Myths and&#xD;
      Facts' about TB diagnostic testing and the clinical trial, respectively, have been produced&#xD;
      and translated from English to Kiswahili, Amharic, isiXhosa and Afrikaans. This information&#xD;
      will be submitted to ethics committees for approval, and be used for public dissemination as&#xD;
      a community engagement tool and given to every study participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthcare facilities and clinical centres involved in this study have access to more than&#xD;
      7,000 suspected TB cases per year, which ensures a large enough population to identify&#xD;
      patients with active pulmonary TB disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Loss to follow-up will be minimized by involving the community upfront through our planned&#xD;
      community engagement plan, performing follow-up interviews with patients on TB treatment&#xD;
      (DOTs - directly observed therapy - patients will be followed-up by data collection regarding&#xD;
      their treatment), and/or conducting home visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment site selection: Healthcare facilities and centres were selected based on reported&#xD;
      high TB burden and previous experience with clinical and field TB trials. Annually, more than&#xD;
      the double of confirmed TB cases are reported in the selected sites, which makes recruitment&#xD;
      of needed number of cases (N=123) over two years' time feasible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study safety: This trial does not contain any experimental intervention that will influence&#xD;
      patients care. Collection of biological samples will be in accordance with WHO guidelines on&#xD;
      blood sampling for research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study monitoring and data management: A written contractual agreement ('Consortium&#xD;
      Agreement') will be signed by the consortium partners, and specific Clinical Trial Agreements&#xD;
      will be signed by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH) and clinical trial centers:&#xD;
      Stellenbosch University, South African Republic, Kilimanjaro Christian Medical University&#xD;
      College, United Republic of Tanzania, and Armauer Hansen Research Institute, Republic of&#xD;
      Ethiopia, before the study start. A primary investigator (PI) at the trial center will be&#xD;
      responsible for reaching milestones, informing work package (WP) and consortium Steering&#xD;
      Committee (SC) leaders on progress, and keeping accounts as defined in project guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On-site and in-house monitoring of trial data and protocol compliance will be performed&#xD;
      according to study analysis protocol, written study plans and standard operating procedures&#xD;
      (SOPs). An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) composed of study site principal&#xD;
      investigators (PIs), individuals with relevant expertise (e.g. data management and/or&#xD;
      clinical background), and a statistician from NIPH will report directly to the SC. The role&#xD;
      of DMC is to monitor data collection, data integrity and project timelines related to data&#xD;
      collection. In addition, Field Evaluation Trial Committee (FETC), formed by local healthcare&#xD;
      workers and clinicians, will be responsible for trial sites patients' safety and integrity.&#xD;
      The FETC will closely work with DMC, and report to the SC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A risk-based approach to monitoring will be used. A secured cloud system will be used to&#xD;
      register screened participants, randomization and assign to a trial arm. Data management,&#xD;
      including cloud system design and maintenance, data cleaning, creation of listings for&#xD;
      in-house monitoring, developing randomisation schedule, progress reports, Statistical&#xD;
      Analysis Plan development, tables, figures, and presentations, and evaluation of primary and&#xD;
      secondary end points, will be overseen by DMC and FETC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study sponsor will host the database and maintain the oversight over recruitment,&#xD;
      protocol compliance, study conduct, data correctness and integrity. Monitoring (on-site and&#xD;
      remotely) and data management will be in the remit of DMC and FETC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No data whatsoever will be generated in the European Union (EU) or Norway, or stored on a&#xD;
      server in the EU or Norway. Data will be stored solely on the institutional servers at our&#xD;
      partner institutions in South Africa, Tanzania, and Ethiopia as required by institutional and&#xD;
      national guidelines. To ensure data protection we guarantee that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data extracted from the SeroSelectTB case report form entered into and stored on&#xD;
           national servers in South Africa, Ethiopia, and Tanzania will be anonymized.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A one-way random algorithm will automatically scramble data rows before data is shared&#xD;
           with the project researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data cannot be traced back to the source/participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Personal identifier information is protected and available only to the national health&#xD;
           services in South Africa, Ethiopia, and Tanzania as required by national guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data made available for analysis (shared with project researchers) will be provided&#xD;
           f.ex. on Excel spread sheets without the unique participant codes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Excel data files will be destroyed after analysis and publication of results.&#xD;
