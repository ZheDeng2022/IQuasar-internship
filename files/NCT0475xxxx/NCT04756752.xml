  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mobility is one of the most important factors in the quality of life of people with a&#xD;
      lower-limb amputation. However, mobility and physical activity are often limited. 61% of&#xD;
      amputees is not sufficiently active in daily life and only about 15% of the Dutch amputees&#xD;
      regularly participates in sports. Physical inactivity is known to increase the risk of&#xD;
      comorbidities, especially among amputation patients who already have a higher prevalence of&#xD;
      vascular diseases, diabetes and osteoarthritis. It is clear that sufficient daily physical&#xD;
      activity is important to optimize the health and quality of life of amputees.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research has shown that higher aerobic capacity, higher muscle force and the absence of&#xD;
      comorbidities are related to better walking ability, as walking is more energy consuming for&#xD;
      people with an amputation. It is therefore expected that increasing strength and&#xD;
      cardiovascular fitness results in better mobility, higher daily activity, better physical&#xD;
      health and a better quality of life among amputees. To improve physical capacity and sports&#xD;
      participation in people with a lower-limb amputation, the Sint Maartenskliniek (Nijmegen, The&#xD;
      Netherlands) and Dutch football club N.E.C. Nijmegen developed a new exercise program: Fit en&#xD;
      Vitaal. Participants perform a six-week training program with three training sessions each&#xD;
      week (fitness, aqua-fitness and a sports and play session) under the guidance of movement&#xD;
      agogue. Thereafter, they continue with a low-frequency movement intervention during which&#xD;
      they attend various sports clinics once a week for eight months. As social support and&#xD;
      contact with peers are important factors in sports participation for amputees, the Fit en&#xD;
      Vitaal program was designed as a yearly returning program with a fixed group of participants&#xD;
      at the start of each year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This exploratory study aimed to evaluate both the direct and indirect effects of the Fit en&#xD;
      Vitaal program on people with a lower-limb amputation in terms of walking ability, functional&#xD;
      mobility, oxygen consumption during walking, daily physical activity at home and experienced&#xD;
      quality of life. It is expected that all will improve after the first six weeks of training,&#xD;
      and the effects will remain after the eight-month low-frequency training.&#xD;

      Mobility is one of the most important factors in the quality of life of people with a&#xD;
      lower-limb amputation.However, many experience limited mobility and show less daily activity&#xD;
      compared to healthy individuals. 61% of amputees does not reach a level of sufficiently&#xD;
      active in daily life and only about 15% of the Dutch amputees regularly participates in&#xD;
      sports. Physical inactivity is known to increase the risk of comorbidities, especially among&#xD;
      amputation patients who already have a higher prevalence of vascular diseases, diabetes and&#xD;
      osteoarthritis. It is clear that sufficient daily physical activity is important to optimize&#xD;
      the health and quality of life of amputees.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A simple way of increasing activity in amputees is increasing their standing and walking&#xD;
      duration during the day. Walking is known to require more energy in amputees than in healthy&#xD;
      individuals due to their lack of active function in their prosthetic leg. Higher aerobic&#xD;
      capacity, higher muscle force and the absence of comorbidities in amputees were already&#xD;
      related to better walking ability. Therefore, increasing strength and cardiovascular fitness&#xD;
      would presumably result in higher daily activity, physical health and quality of life among&#xD;
      amputees.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To improve physical capacity and sports participation in people with a lower-limb amputation,&#xD;
      the Sint Maartenskliniek (Nijmegen, The Netherlands) and Dutch football club N.E.C. Nijmegen&#xD;
      developed a new exercise program: Fit en Vitaal. Participants perform a six-week training&#xD;
      program with three training sessions each week (fitness, aqua-fitness and a sports and play&#xD;
      session) under the guidance of movement agogue. Thereafter, they continue with a&#xD;
      low-frequency movement intervention during which they attend various sports clinics once a&#xD;
      week for eight months. As social support and contact with peers are important factors in&#xD;
      sports participation for amputees, the Fit en Vitaal program was designed as a yearly&#xD;
      returning program with a fixed group of participants at the start of each year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This exploratory study aims to evaluate both the direct and indirect effects of the Fit en&#xD;
      Vitaal program on people with a lower-limb amputation. Therefore, the primary objective is to&#xD;
      evaluate the effect of the program on walking ability, functional mobility and oxygen&#xD;
      consumption during walking. As a secondary objective, the effect on daily physical activity&#xD;
      at home and experienced quality of life is examined. It is expected that all will improve&#xD;
      after the first six weeks of training, and the effect will remain after finishing the&#xD;
      eight-month low-frequency training.&#xD;
