    <textblock>
      Liver biopsy is still used as the gold standard in the diagnosis of many liver diseases.&#xD;
      During the observation after liver biopsy, patients are hospitalized on their right side,&#xD;
      which is the biopsy side, with the thought that adverse events (complications) such as&#xD;
      bleeding or bile leakage will be less. Patients who do not develop complications after 4-6&#xD;
      hours of observation are discharged home. Some of the patients state that the right&#xD;
      side-lying position for 4-6 hours is uncomfortable than the biopsy itself, and they prefer to&#xD;
      lie on their back. In our study, researchers aim to investigate the rate of complications&#xD;
      after biopsy, what recovery position found more acceptable by the patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Liver biopsy is still used as the gold standard in the diagnosis of many liver diseases. The&#xD;
      health practice notification (SUT) makes the diagnosis with liver biopsy mandatory for the&#xD;
      treatment of chronic viral hepatitis (Chronic Hepatitis B Inf. And Chronic Hepatitis C Inf.).&#xD;
      In daily gastroenterology practice, clinicians frequently perform a liver biopsy for the&#xD;
      diagnosis of non-alcoholic fatty liver (NASH), and to a lesser extent, for the diagnosis of&#xD;
      Wilson Disease and Hemochromatosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the observation after liver biopsy, patients are hospitalized on their right side,&#xD;
      which is the biopsy side, with the argument that there will be less bleeding or bile leakage&#xD;
      complications. Patients who do not develop complications after 4-6 hours of observation are&#xD;
      discharged to their homes. (1) In this study, researchers aimed to investigate the&#xD;
      post-biopsy position of patients who were referred to the clinic for liver biopsy, the rate&#xD;
      of complications after biopsy, and to what extent the patients found the procedure acceptable&#xD;
      according to their post-biopsy position.&#xD;
