  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the efficacy of an electronically-delivered cognitive behavioural&#xD;
      therapy (e-CBT) program versus a mental health coaching program to treat generalized anxiety&#xD;
      disorder (GAD). This randomized trial intervention will provide the e-CBT and mental health&#xD;
      coaching for GAD through a secure, online platform. Participants will be between the ages of&#xD;
      18 and 65 years with a confirmed diagnosis of GAD according to the Diagnostic and Statistical&#xD;
      Manual of Mental Disorders - 5th Edition (DSM-5). Participants will either be offered an&#xD;
      e-CBT program tailored to GAD or an online mental health coaching program over 12 weeks to&#xD;
      address their anxiety symptoms. e-CBT participants will complete pre-designed modules and&#xD;
      homework assignments while receiving personalized feedback and asynchronous interaction with&#xD;
      a therapist through the platform. Participants in the coaching group will be contacted weekly&#xD;
      through the online platform's chat feature. Therapists will ask the participants a series of&#xD;
      pre-designed questions that revolve around a different theme each week to prompt&#xD;
      conversation. Using clinically validated symptomology questionnaires, the efficacy of the&#xD;
      e-CBT program will be compared to the coaching group. These questionnaires will be completed&#xD;
      at baseline, week 6, week 12, and at a 6-month follow-up. Questionnaires include the&#xD;
      State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction&#xD;
      Questionnaire - Short Form (Q-LES-Q-SF), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder - 7 Item (GAD-7),&#xD;
      and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale - 42 Item (DASS-42).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This randomized trial intervention will provide e-CBT for GAD through the Online&#xD;
      Psychotherapy Tool (OPTT), a secure, cloud-based, digital mental health platform.&#xD;
      Participants (age: 18-65 years) will be randomly assigned to either an e-CBT program tailored&#xD;
      to GAD or a mental health coaching program over 12 weeks to address their anxiety symptoms.&#xD;
      In the e-CBT group, participants will complete pre-designed modules and homework assignments&#xD;
      while receiving personalized feedback and asynchronous interaction with a therapist through&#xD;
      the platform. The content of the e-CBT modules is designed to mirror in-person standard CBT&#xD;
      for GAD. There will be 12 weekly sessions that include approximately 30 slides each along&#xD;
      with interactive content, delivered through OPTT. Using clinically validated symptomology&#xD;
      questionnaires, the efficacy of the e-CBT program will be evaluated. In the mental health&#xD;
      coaching group, participants will have weekly interaction with a therapist through the chat&#xD;
      function in OPTT where the coach will check in on the participant and touch on a specific&#xD;
      subject each week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants (n = 110; 50 e-CBT participants, 50 coaching) aged 18-65 years will be recruited&#xD;
      at Queen's University from outpatient psychiatry clinics at both Kingston Health Sciences&#xD;
      Centre sites (Hotel Dieu Hospital and Kingston General Hospital). Additional recruitment will&#xD;
      occur from Providence Care Hospital, family doctors, physicians, clinicians, and&#xD;
      self-referrals in Kingston, Ontario, Canada. Once informed consent is provided, participants&#xD;
      will be evaluated by a psychiatrist on the research team through secure video appointments to&#xD;
      make or confirm a diagnosis of a generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) using the Diagnostic and&#xD;
      Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the informed consent process, it is explained to all participants that this program is&#xD;
      not a crisis resource and that they will not have access to their therapist at all times. In&#xD;
      the case of an emergency, participants are directed to the proper resources (e.g., emergency&#xD;
      department, crisis lines, etc.) and this event will be reported to the principal investigator&#xD;
      of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both e-CBT modules and in-person CBT sessions are designed to instill constructive and&#xD;
      balanced coping strategies in participants. During the program, the focus will be on&#xD;
      essential thinking and behavioural skills to help the patients become more engaged in&#xD;
      day-to-day activities. The focus of the sessions is placed on the connection between&#xD;
      thoughts, behaviours, emotions, physical reactions, and the environment. The goal is to&#xD;
      change how patients evaluate negative beliefs and thought processes and their relationship&#xD;
      with depression. Our goal is to adjust the negative thinking so that participants can think&#xD;
      about and adapt to the things that are happening to them. This allows them to adjust the way&#xD;
      they behave and think about their problems in a way that is not as negative and replaces&#xD;
      those thoughts and behaviours with potentially more realistic and productive ones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The e-CBT care plan consists of 12 weekly sessions of approximately 30 slides and interactive&#xD;
      content, delivered through OPTT. The e-CBT module content mirrors in-person standard CBT&#xD;
      content, including different weekly topics, general information, skill overviews, and&#xD;
      homework. Participants are instructed to go through the content and complete homework at the&#xD;
      end of the session which helps them practice skills they learned through that session.&#xD;
      Homework is submitted through OPTT and reviewed by the therapist assigned to the participant,&#xD;
      who will provide personalized feedback within three days of submission. Therapists have&#xD;
      access to pre-designed session-specific feedback templates to use as a basic structure to&#xD;
      write their feedback. By doing so, the time needed to respond to each patient is reduced and&#xD;
      therefore the number of patients each therapist can handle increases. On average, developing&#xD;
      this feedback takes a therapist 15-20 minutes per patient. In addition to the weekly&#xD;
      feedback, participants have the option to message their therapist through the platform&#xD;
      throughout the week regarding any questions or concerns they may have.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the coaching treatment program will have weekly interactions with a therapist&#xD;
      through the chat feature in OPTT. The therapist will reach out weekly using the following&#xD;
      structured question prompts to initiate interaction with their patient:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 1 - Mood: Tell me about yourself. How have you been feeling lately? How has the pandemic&#xD;
      affected your mood? What differences have you noticed in your mood compared to the past? Week&#xD;

      habits. How does your anxiety affect your appetite? Are you satisfied with your diet? How&#xD;

      hours a day do you usually spend on your phone? What is your favourite app? Do you play any&#xD;

&#xD;
      All therapists are research assistants hired by the principal investigator. They all undergo&#xD;
      training in psychotherapy and additional training from a psychiatrist on the research team&#xD;
      before any interaction with participants. During this training, therapists complete feedback&#xD;
      on practice homework, which is reviewed by a psychiatrist on the research team to ensure&#xD;
      adequate quality of work. All therapists are supervised by the lead psychiatrist, who is an&#xD;
      expert in the area of electronically delivered psychotherapy. Feedback is always reviewed by&#xD;
      the lead psychiatrist, before submission to the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will only be identifiable by an anonymous identification number and any hard&#xD;
      copies of consent forms will be stored securely in a locked filing cabinet and destroyed 5&#xD;
      years after study completion. Participant data will only be accessible by the care providers&#xD;
      directly assigned to the participant and only anonymized data will be provided to the&#xD;
      analysis team members. Participants will have the option to withdraw from the study at any&#xD;
      point and request for their data to be removed from the analysis.&#xD;
