      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The COVID-19 pandemic raised new challenges in supporting patients, relatives and staff for&#xD;
      psychosomatic, psychiatric and psychological C&amp;L services in general hospitals worldwide. It&#xD;
      is intended to build upon the experience gained so far in order to be well prepared for the&#xD;
      future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this international online survey are&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To summarize the efforts made in psychosocial care in the context of the COVID-19&#xD;
           pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the experiences made with the established services so far.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess the need for networking, cooperation and support.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Improvement of psychosocial care in acute hospitals in the context of pandemics.&#xD;
&#xD;

      (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethic approval:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all participating countries the respective ethics committees were informed about the&#xD;
      survey and it was checked with them, how far and what kind of country-specific vote of an&#xD;
      ethics committee was necessary. Written statements, declarations or votes were obtained from&#xD;
      all participating countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting:&#xD;
&#xD;

      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;

      psychological C&amp;L services from 14 European countries (Austria, Belgium, Finland, Germany,&#xD;
      France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, United Kingdom)&#xD;
      as well as parts of Canada (Quebec and Ontario region) and Iran participating.&#xD;
&#xD;

      of the respective hospitals in the physical care of COVID-19 patients, structures /&#xD;
      organization of psychosocial care for COVID-19 patients in the participating hospitals,&#xD;

      committee-based approach informed by the European Social Survey (ESS) Round 9 Translation&#xD;
