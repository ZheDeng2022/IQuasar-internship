      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      To train and test a mathematical model to predict complete concentric collapse at the level&#xD;
      of the palate (CCCp, primary) and other sites of upper airway collapse (secondary) during&#xD;
      drug-induced sleep endoscopy (DISE) using the data captured during a diagnostic&#xD;
      polysomnography (PSG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The site, pattern and degree of upper airway collapse is associated with distinct flow&#xD;
      features as captured during a baseline PSG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retrospective trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      200 patients with moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA, AHI ≥ 15/h) who underwent&#xD;
      both a DISE and a diagnostic PSG at the Antwerp University Hospital (UZA) between January&#xD;
      2018 and December 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME MEASURES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Raw data as captured during a diagnostic PSG, including electroencephalography (EEG), flow,&#xD;
      electrocardiography (ECG), electromyography (EMG), oxygen desaturation and breathing effort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE / DATA ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data of 200 patients will be retrospectively included into this study protocol. Different&#xD;
      machine learning techniques will be adopted to select features, train the model and test the&#xD;
      model.&#xD;
