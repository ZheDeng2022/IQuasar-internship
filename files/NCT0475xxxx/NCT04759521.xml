  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aims of this study are to evaluate liver fibrosis with two-dimensional (2D) shear wave&#xD;
      elastography (SWE) technique in inactive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) carriers and&#xD;
      patients with active chronic hepatitis B (CHB), with the help of a propagation map, compare&#xD;
      this method with histopathological results in patients with CHB and determine the suitability&#xD;
      of 2D-SWE for use instead of liver biopsy by evaluating fibrosis before and after treatment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 253 patients with CHB and inactive HBsAg carriers as well as a control group of 30&#xD;
      healthy individuals were included in the study between January 2019 and October 2020. Liver&#xD;
      stiffness measurements with 2D-SWE, fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) and aspartate aminotransferase to&#xD;
      platelet ratio index (APRI) scoring and additional liver biopsy in patients with CHB were&#xD;
      performed in all cases with the help of the propagation map. Depending on the degree of&#xD;
      fibrosis, liver stiffness was measured again at 24 and 48 weeks in patients who received&#xD;
      antiviral therapy. Spearman rank correlation test was used for analysing correlation between&#xD;
      variables, and receiver operating curve analysis was used to evaluate diagnostic performance&#xD;
      in terms of fibrosis.&#xD;

    <description>Liver stiffness levels of group 1 and group 2 patients were compared by measuring in kPa and m / s using 2D-SWE technique. Possible increase and decrease values in liver stiffness measurements were calculated at 24 and 48 weeks in subjects who received antiviral therapy.</description>
