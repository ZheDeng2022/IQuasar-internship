  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With 63% of consumers willing to consider investing in facial aesthetics and 73% of consumers&#xD;
      worldwide expecting to invest in aesthetic treatments in the upcoming year, it is imperative&#xD;
      to explore patient satisfaction and psychosocial impact of a multimodal aesthetic treatment&#xD;
      in a millennial cohort. The investigators hypothesize that a combination approach to facial&#xD;
      aesthetic treatment in a millennial cohort will result in increased patient-reported&#xD;
      satisfaction in multiple areas, including perception of aging concerns and quality of life.&#xD;
    </textblock>

      This is a single-center, prospective, rater-blinded, pilot study to evaluate patient&#xD;
      satisfaction with facial aesthetic treatment using a combination of botulinum toxin and&#xD;
      dermal fillers. The three types of injectables are Botox Cosmetic (onabotulinumtoxinA),&#xD;
      Juvéderm Voluma XC (hyaluronic acid gel filler), and Juvéderm Volbella XC (hyaluronic acid&#xD;
      gel filler). Twenty individuals who belong to the millennial generation (i.e., born between&#xD;
      January 1, 1981 and December 31, 1996)1 and meet eligibility criteria will be enrolled. Study&#xD;
      participants will receive all three injectables during a single procedure, with an optional&#xD;
      touch-up treatment at 2 weeks. The primary endpoint is the change in satisfaction after&#xD;
      facial aesthetic treatment, using the FACE-Q Satisfaction with Facial Appearance Overall&#xD;
      Scale. Other outcome measures include various FACE-Q Aesthetic scales, digital skin imaging&#xD;
      analysis, photographs, and rater-blinded clinical assessment using the Global Aesthetic&#xD;
      Improvement Scale (GAIS).&#xD;

    <description>To evaluate changes in patient's satisfaction with their appearance following a combination facial aesthetic treatment, using the FACE-Q Satisfaction with Facial Appearance Overall Scale. This tool consists of several questions. For each question, the study participant selects a number from 1 to 4. Higher number are associated with higher satisfaction with facial appearance. The raw scores of the primary outcome measure were transformed by the Rasch measurement method into a 0-to-100 point scale.</description>

        <description>To evaluate changes in patient's satisfaction with their appearance following a combination facial aesthetic treatment, using the FACE-Q Satisfaction with Facial Appearance Overall Scale. This tool consists of several questions. For each question, the study participant selects a number from 1 to 4. Higher number are associated with higher satisfaction with facial appearance. The raw scores of the primary outcome measure were transformed by the Rasch measurement method into a 0-to-100 point scale.</description>
