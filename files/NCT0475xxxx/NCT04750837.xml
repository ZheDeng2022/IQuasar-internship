    <textblock>
      In chronic diabetic foot ulcer, if the conventional dressing fails, new therapeutic options&#xD;
      such as recombinant human growth factors and bioengineered skin substitutes may be&#xD;
      beneficial, but the cost is a limiting factor. Autologous platelet rich plasma is a&#xD;
      cost-effective method that enhances wound healing by promoting the healing process by local&#xD;
      release of growth factors.&#xD;

      The term &quot;chronic wound&quot; was first used in literature in the 1950s to refer to wounds that&#xD;
      were difficult to heal or did not follow a normal healing process. However, the term has met&#xD;
      criticism for its uncertainty regarding the duration of chronicity. Martin &amp; Nunan, 2015,&#xD;
      defined a &quot;chronic wound&quot; as a barrier defect that has not healed in 3 months, and Leaper &amp;&#xD;
      Durani, 2008, defined it as a wound that lacks a 20-40% reduction in its size after 2-4 weeks&#xD;
      of optimal treatment or when there is no complete healing after 6 weeks. Recent reviews have&#xD;
      highlighted the lack of consensus regarding the definition of a &quot;chronic wound&quot; and the need&#xD;
      for further researches in this area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetic foot ulcer is a major complication of diabetes mellitus and is the major component&#xD;
      of diabetic foot syndrome. This medical condition affects 15% of all patients with diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus. Alvarsson et al. in 2012 reported that up to 88% of all lower leg amputations were&#xD;
      related to diabetic foot ulcers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The impact of chronic wounds on the health and quality of patients' life and their families&#xD;
      should not be underestimated. Patients with chronic wounds may experience chronic pain, loss&#xD;
      of function and mobility, depression, and anxiety, increased social stress and isolation,&#xD;
      prolonged hospitalization, increased financial burden, and increased morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Growth factors (GFs) play an essential role in the process of wound healing and tissue&#xD;
      regeneration. Each GF has more than one effect on the healing process and acts by binding to&#xD;
      specific cell membrane receptors on the target cells. Growth factors' effects include&#xD;
      promoting chemotaxis, inducing cell migration and proliferation, and stimulate cells to&#xD;
      upregulate protein production. These growth factors not only regulate cell migration and&#xD;
      proliferation but also promote angiogenesis and remodel the extracellular matrix, creating an&#xD;
      ideal environment that favors the cutaneous wound healing process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the last decades, the use of emerging cellular therapies, such as platelet-rich plasma&#xD;
      (PRP), has more attention in a variety of diseases and settings for its potential use in the&#xD;
      regenerative medicine as a therapeutic agent and can have an adjunctive role in a&#xD;
      standardized, quality treatment plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRP is defined as plasma containing above-baseline concentrations of platelets, which is from&#xD;
      140 000-400 000/μl. PRP is isolated through the centrifugation of whole blood. Simply, its&#xD;
      actions are based on the infusion of elevated platelets, thereby theoretically enhancing the&#xD;
      biological healing capacity and tissue generation in the wound bed. Enzyme-linked&#xD;
      immunosorbent assay studies of PRP have quantified the presence of increases in GFs such as&#xD;
      transforming GF β, epidermal GF, and platelet-derived GF. Through degranulation of the alpha&#xD;
      granules in platelets, PRP can secrete various GFs, which have been documented to initiate&#xD;
      the wound healing process&#xD;
