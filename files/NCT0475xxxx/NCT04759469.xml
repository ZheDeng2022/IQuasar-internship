      Background: Physical activity is known to modify some of the diabetes risk factors; however,&#xD;
      solid evidence is still needed to precisely know the optimum form of training best fits the&#xD;
      individual needs of type II diabetic (T2D) patients.&#xD;

      Objectives: the purpose of this study was to compare between high intensity interval training&#xD;
      (HIIT) and moderate-intensity interval training (MIIT) effect on functional capacity (as a&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory parameter), and on glucose control and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) (as&#xD;
      metabolic parameters) in T2D patients, and to test exercise acceptability within these&#xD;
      patients. Methods: 60 participants had participated in this study. Their ages ranged from 45&#xD;
      to 65 years. They were randomized into two equal groups (30/group); group (A) did HIIT and&#xD;
      group (B) did MIIT. Both groups received 12 weeks of training. Measurements for six minute&#xD;
      walking distance (6MWD), fasting blood glucose (FBG), and HbA1C levels were done before and&#xD;
      after the study. Physical activity enjoyment scale (PACES) were filled by the patients by the&#xD;
      end of the study; testing exercise enjoyment.&#xD;

    <description>The Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale (PACES) score, out of 119. It is an 18-item scale that assesses enjoyment for physical activity by asking participants to rate &quot;how you feel at the moment about the physical activity you have been doing&quot; using a 7-point bipolar Likert scale, from 1 (I enjoy it) to 7 (I hate it). Eleven items were negatively worded and seven items were positively worded. After reverse scoring the 11negatively worded items, an overall enjoyment for physical activity score is determined by summing the items, with a range of 18-126 being possible. Higher scores indicate higher enjoyment.</description>
