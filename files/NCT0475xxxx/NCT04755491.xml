  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a frequently encountered complication in the intensive care unit&#xD;
      (ICU), affecting on average 25 to 35% of patients. It is associated with an increased&#xD;
      mortality, proportional to AKI severity. RRT induces important shifts of water and&#xD;
      electrolytes. Thus, significant amount of chloride might unintentionally be transferred to&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chloride is the main anion of the organism. It is involved in the regulation of numerous&#xD;
      physiological processes. Thus, significant and rapid modification of chloride amount&#xD;
      contained in the organism (as might be induced by renal replacement therapy) may be&#xD;
      responsible for important, and potentially deleterious, consequences to critically ill&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have shown that the administration of high amounts of chloride rich solutions (such&#xD;
      as sodium chloride (NaCl) 0,9%) was associated with the development of hyperchloremic&#xD;
      acidosis in a dose-dependent manner. This hyperchloremic acidosis could also be theoretically&#xD;
      associated with deleterious physiological effects. However, the true clinical consequences of&#xD;
      administration of high amounts of chloride rich solutions remains unclear. Their effect on&#xD;
      mortality remains a matter of debate, the results of studies being very conflicting in that&#xD;
      respect. Nevertheless, hyperchloremia itself and/or the rise of chloremia in the intensive&#xD;
      care unit seems to be associated with increased mortality. Moreover, the impact of those&#xD;
      chloride rich solutions on the development of acute kidney injury is also a subject of&#xD;
      controversy, data from the literature being here again very conflicting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent study already showed that continuous RRT (CRRT) techniques induce a significant&#xD;
      transfer of sodium to patients benefiting from those techniques. In that study, the amount of&#xD;
      sodium transferred depended mainly on the difference between patient's natremia and sodium&#xD;
      concentration in dialysate and/or replacement fluid (usually higher than patient's natremia)&#xD;
      used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By analogy, it is likely that an occult transfer of chloride also happens during RRT, given&#xD;
      the high chloride concentration of dialysate fluids (in continuous veno-venous dialysis,&#xD;
      CVVD) and replacement fluids (in continuous veno-venous hemofiltration, CVVH), or when these&#xD;
      2 modalities are combined (continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration, CVVHDF). Finally, the&#xD;
      investigators suspect, although it remains undemonstrated so far, that the RRT technique&#xD;
      (convective vs. diffusive) may influence this transfer, to an unknown extent. Nevertheless,&#xD;
      this transfer and its potential determinants have never been studied yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If chloride overload (and its potential clinical consequences) induced by the administration&#xD;
      of solutions such as NaCl 0,9% is being extensively studied, no study has ever focused on&#xD;
      chloride transfer that may result from the use of renal replacement therapy. However, as&#xD;
      mentioned above, it is very likely that such a chloride transfer to patients happens, and&#xD;
      that its magnitude depends on different parameters such as RRT modality, RRT fluids&#xD;
      characteristics, or patient's chloremia at the start of RRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators conduct the present study to describe and compare the intensity of chloride&#xD;
      transfer during the first 24 hours of renal replacement therapy by continuous veno-venous&#xD;
      hemofiltration (CVVH), continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVD),or continuous veno-venous&#xD;
      hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF), and to determine if that transfer is more important with one or&#xD;
      the other of those two techniques, in ICU patients affected with severe AKI requiring RRT.&#xD;
      Secondary aims are to describe and compare the effects of chloride transfer under 3 RRT&#xD;
      modalities (CVVD, CVVH and CVVHDF) on patient's outcome, organ failures, electrolyte and&#xD;
      acid-base balance, fluid balance and hemodynamics. Finally, the investigators aim to develop&#xD;
      a pharmacokinetic compartment model of chloride transfer during different modalities of RRT.&#xD;

        We will enroll all consecutive adult ICU patients, with stage III AKI (according to Kidney&#xD;
        Disease: Improving Global Outcome (KDIGO) classification), and requiring continuous RRT&#xD;
