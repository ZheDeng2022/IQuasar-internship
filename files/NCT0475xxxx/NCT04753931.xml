  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of sensory training, which&#xD;
      will be applied to the trunk in addition to Bobath-based and trunk-focused exercises on trunk&#xD;
      functions, sense, balance and gait. The secondary aim of the study is to investigate the&#xD;
      effects of Bobath-based and trunk-focused exercises on trunk functional capacity, balance and&#xD;
      gait performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study consists of two groups: Bobath-based trunk training group and, sensory training&#xD;
      group in addition to Bobath-based trunk training. The information of individuals who agree to&#xD;
      participate in the study and meet the criteria for admission to the study will be recorded&#xD;
      with a demographic information form. The scales, questionnaires and tests determined to&#xD;
      evaluate the individual's trunk position sense and functions, balance and walking performance&#xD;
      will be applied before and after the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to the definition of the World Health Organization, stroke is a clinical scene that&#xD;
      develops due to vascular causes, causes focal or global brain damage, begins acutely, and&#xD;
      progresses with neurological symptoms lasting 24 hours or longer. İt is stated that stroke is&#xD;
      the third leading cause of disability worldwide. As a result of stroke, sensory disturbances&#xD;
      may occur in individuals as well as motor symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of sensory training, which&#xD;
      will be applied to the trunk in addition to Bobath-based and trunk-focused exercises on trunk&#xD;
      functions, sense, balance and gait. The secondary aim of the study is to investigate the&#xD;
      effects of Bobath-based and trunk-focused exercises on trunk functional capacity, balance and&#xD;
      gait performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study consists of two groups: Bobath-based trunk training group and, sensory training&#xD;
      group in addition to Bobath-based trunk training. All participants will be randomly&#xD;
      distributed (using software at http://www.randomizer.org). First, 20 patients will be&#xD;
      included in our study and the total number of patients will be determined by calculating the&#xD;
      effect size with the interm analysis to be performed later. Exercises will be applied to the&#xD;
      individuals participating in the study 3 days a week, 8 weeks and 24 sessions in total.&#xD;
      Exercises will be applied to the individuals after conventional therapy session. The&#xD;
      information of individuals who agree to participate in the study and meet the criteria for&#xD;
      admission to the study will be recorded with a demographic information form. The scales,&#xD;
      questionnaires and tests determined to evaluate the individual's trunk position sense and&#xD;
      functions, balance and walking performance will be applied before and after the study.&#xD;
