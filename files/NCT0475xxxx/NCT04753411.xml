      The 3-m backward walk test (3MBWT) is used to evaluate neuromuscular control, proprioception,&#xD;
      protective reflexes, fall risk and balance. The aim of our study was to reveal the&#xD;
      test-retest reliability and validity of the 3MBWT in Multiple Sclerosis patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study will be done as a &quot;test-retest&quot; design and psychometric properties of 3 m backward&#xD;
      walking test in MS patients will be examined. Mini Mental State Examination, 3 m walk back&#xD;
      test, Berg Balance Scale, Timed Up and Go, Timed 25 Step Walking Test and 4-Square Step Test&#xD;
      will be applied to the patients. All evaluations will be made by the same physiotherapist.&#xD;
      The second and third evaluation (retest) will be performed by the same physiotherapist two&#xD;
      days after the first evaluation (test) and 2 weeks later to measure test-retest reliability.&#xD;
      It will be preferable to collect data with the same evaluator to avoid inter-rater error rate&#xD;
      between evaluations. It will be preferable to collect data with the same evaluator to avoid&#xD;
      inter-rater error rate between evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size, according to Lexell and Downham (2005), 40-50 participants should be&#xD;
      included in reliability studies. Considering this recommendation, which defines the&#xD;
      reliability of 3MBWT, it is planned to include 50 individuals with MS in our study.&#xD;

      The methodological model of the study is the validity and reliability study. Individuals who&#xD;
      applied to Fırat University Training and Research Hospital after ethical approval and&#xD;
      diagnosed with MS by a neurologist will be included in our study. It is planned to collect&#xD;
      data from individuals who meet the inclusion criteria on a voluntary basis with the Helsinki&#xD;
      Declaration. As demographic characteristics; Patients' age, gender, body weight, height, EDSS&#xD;
      score, occupation and education status, as a history of the disease, the number of falls in&#xD;
      the last year and the type of MS will be recorded. Inclusion criteria for the volunteers;&#xD;
      Individuals with relapsing-remitting MS, with an EDSS score between 05≤ and ≤5.5, with an&#xD;
      EDSS score between 18-65, and individuals with a score of 24 and above in the Mini Mental&#xD;
      State Examination and who can independently walk a minimum of 10 m will be included. Also&#xD;
      exclusion criteria for volunteers; High level spasticity of the lower limbs (Ashworth score 3&#xD;
      or 4), who had an acute MS attack or had a history of an attack within the last 1 month, had&#xD;
      orthopedic or systemic problems that prevented participation in tests, had another known&#xD;
      neuromuscular disorder other than MS, had visual involvement or diplopia, and Having a&#xD;
      cardio-pulmonary problem that will prevent him from participating in tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study will be done as a &quot;test-retest&quot; design and psychometric properties of 3 m backward&#xD;
      walking test in MS patients will be examined. Mini Mental State Examination, 3 m walk back&#xD;
      test, Berg Balance Scale, Timed Up and Go, Timed 25 Step Walking Test and 4-Square Step Test&#xD;
      will be applied to the patients. All evaluations will be made by the same physiotherapist.&#xD;
      The second and third evaluation (retest) will be performed by the same physiotherapist two&#xD;
      days after the first evaluation (test) and 2 weeks later to measure test-retest reliability.&#xD;
      It will be preferable to collect data with the same evaluator to avoid inter-rater error rate&#xD;
      between evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size, according to Lexell and Downham, 30-50 participants should be included in&#xD;
      reliability studies . Considering this recommendation, which defines the reliability of&#xD;
      3MBWT, it is planned to include 50 individuals with MS in our study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis SPSS for Windows 20.00 computer package program will be used for all&#xD;
      statistical analyzes. Descriptive statistical information will be given as mean ± standard&#xD;
      deviation (x ± SD) or%. Interclass Correlation Coefficients (ICC) and Cronbach's coefficients&#xD;
      values will be examined for the reliability and internal consistency of 3MGDYT. The data will&#xD;
      be analyzed with appropriate statistical methods and the statistical significance level will&#xD;
      be accepted as p &lt;0.05.&#xD;

    <measure>3 Meter Backward Walking Test</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The 3-meter distance is marked with a black tape and the participants are asked to align their heels with black tape. Individuals are asked to walk backwards as soon as possible with the &quot;walk&quot; command and stop when they reach 3 meters. Meanwhile, the elapsed time is recorded in seconds. The evaluation will take place three times and the average time will be recorded.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Berg Balance Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>It was designed for quantitative evaluation of balance and determination of fall risk, and was chosen because it evaluates individuals' ability to maintain their balance while performing functional activities. According to the scores obtained from the test in question, the cases were divided into groups as &quot;high fall risk (0-20 points)&quot;, &quot;medium fall risk (21-40 points)&quot;, &quot;low fall risk (41-56)&quot;. score) &quot;. Fifty-six, the highest score, is considered to show the best balance. Turkish validity and reliability study of the scale was conducted by Şahin et al.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Timed Get Up and Go Test</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>It is applied to assess the balance and fall risk of individuals. The patient is first asked to sit on a chair. The patient is then asked to stand up, walk regularly at a predetermined distance of 3 meters, return at the end of 3 meters and sit on a chair. The walking time of the patient during the test is recorded with the stopwatch in seconds. The test was repeated three times and the average value will be recorded</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>4-Square Step Test</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Aims to evaluate dynamic balance and stepping forward, side and back over objects. Using tape, 1 horizontal and 1 vertical line is made in the form of diagonal 4 divisions. At the start of the test, the individual stands in the upper left square. Then they step clockwise with both feet before moving on to the next frame: first to the right, then back, then to the left, and finally to the back position. They immediately follow this by stepping counterclockwise. After 1 application attempt, the time is saved for the next 2 attempts and the best 1 attempt is counted. Among older adults living in the community, over 15 seconds has been associated with an increased risk of falling</description>
