  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the feasibility and effect of a 12-week&#xD;
      remotely-supervised rehabilitation program in male patients between 40-60 years old with&#xD;
      newly diagnosed obstructive sleep apnea with Apnea-Hypopnea Index greater than 15 episodes&#xD;
      per hour indicated to CPAP therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The intervention group will undergo comprehensive remotely-supervised rehabilitaiton program&#xD;
      in home conditions with teleconsultation (contains telecoaching, telemonitoring) via regular&#xD;
      phone calls and e-mails at least 1-2 times a week. The intervention will include nutrition,&#xD;
      health-related lifestyle and behavioral changes recommendations, and at least 5 times a week&#xD;
      30 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic training, 10 minutes of inspiratory and expiratory&#xD;
      muscle training with breathing device and 10 minutes of oropharyngeal exercise along with&#xD;
      individually titrated CPAP therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group will undergo individually titrated CPAP therapy only. The participants in&#xD;
      both groups will go through the following assessments before and after this study:&#xD;
      polysomnography, spirometry, anthropometry and body composition examination, laboratory&#xD;
      values examination, quality of life questionnaires, Epworth sleepiness scale, 6-min walking&#xD;
      test.&#xD;

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Apnea-Hypopnea Index at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Measure will be taken from Polysomnography. Index shows number of apneic or hypopneic periods with duration at least 5 seconds in one hour. Higher Index means worse outcome.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Epworth Sleepiness Scale Score at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>ESS Score is validated, self-reported instrument of patient's perception of obstructive sleep apnea. Possible scores range is from 0 to 24 points. Higher score means worse outcome.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in SF-36 Questionnaire Score at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>SF-36 Score is validated, self-reported instrument of patient's perception of health state and quality of life. Possible scores range is from 0 to 100 points. Higher score means better outcome.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in 6 Minutes Walking Test at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>6MWT will be evaluated on flat 30 metres long track marked with two cones. Longer distance means better outcome.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Maximal Inspiratory Pressure at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will make 3-5 attempts with 1 minute pause between them. Noted will be the highest score. Higher score means better outcome.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Maximal Expiratory Pressure at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will make 3-5 attempts with 1 minute pause between them. Noted will be the highest score. Higher score means better outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Oxygen Desaturation Index at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Measure will be taken from Polysomnography. ODI means number of times per hour of sleep that the blood's oxygen level drop by a certain degree from baseline.</description>
