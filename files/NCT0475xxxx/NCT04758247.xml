  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the TheraNova Neuromodulation System in&#xD;
      overactive bladder (OAB) patients. The primary safety endpoint will be device-related adverse&#xD;
      events. The primary effectiveness endpoint will be urinary urge incontinence (UUI) responder&#xD;
      rate at 12 weeks (a responder is defined as a subject who experiences at least a 50%&#xD;
      reduction in the mean frequency of UUI events per day from baseline to 12 weeks as measured&#xD;
      in the 3-day voiding diaries). Responder rate will be compared between subjects randomized to&#xD;
      the active treatment vs. the sham treatment.&#xD;
