  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human microbial flora transfer studies in rodent models have clearly identified that&#xD;
      age-associated microbiota dysbiosis can play a decisive role with respect to pathologies or&#xD;
      complications linked to aging: increased intestinal permeability, in place of systemic&#xD;
      inflammation, dysfunction of immune cells and insulin resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial therefore aims to validate the process of ex vivo transfer to the rat of human&#xD;
      microbiota selected from three categories of male individuals: young adults, healthy older&#xD;
      adults and frail older adults, with the evaluation of the bacterial population of stool by&#xD;
      analysis of the 16S rRNA gene.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to validate a process of ex vivo stool transfer from humans to rats.&#xD;
      Single-center intervention research with minimal risks and constraints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploration of the bacterial composition of the intestinal microbiota in healthy adult&#xD;
      volunteers, healthy elderly and frail elderly. The evaluation of the bacterial population of&#xD;
      the stool will be done by analysis of the 16S rRNA gene.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives will evaluate the muscular functional abilities the body composition&#xD;
      measurement, at Day 0 (visit 2) and the inflammatory status at Day 0 - 7 (visit 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seconds parameters are the following :&#xD;
&#xD;
      seated, standing, walking, and direction changes, a balance test, a walking speed test and a&#xD;
      chair lift test, the maximum voluntary force of manual gripping, the maximum muscle strength&#xD;
      of the quadriceps and the level of autonomy&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocole includes 3 visits :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 1 : Day 0-7 = inclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 2 : Day 0 = tests and questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 3 : Day 0 ± 7 : stool collect&#xD;

    <measure>Measurement of muscular functional aptitudes with the Get up and Go muscular test scale.</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0</time_frame>
    <description>Test that assesses seated, standing, walking and changes of direction transfers. This is a simple validated field test modified secondarily by adding the measured time. The subject is seated on a chair with armrests, placed in front of a wall 3 meters away. The subject should stand up, remain standing, walk to the wall, turn around without touching the wall, return to the seat, walk around it and sit down again. The rating is carried out with a scale rated from 1 to 5: 1 - no instability ; 2 - very slightly abnormal (slow execution) ; 3 - moderately abnormal (hesitation, compensatory movements) ; 4 - abnormal (the patient trips) ; 5 - very abnormal (permanent risk of falling).</description>

    <description>This test includes a balance test, a walking speed test and a chair lift test. It makes it possible to assess the physical performance of an individual. Adding up the scores for all tests provides an overall performance score. A score of less than 8 is an indicator of the risk of sarcopenia (or age-related muscular dystrophy)</description>
