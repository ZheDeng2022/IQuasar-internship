  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cervical cancer is one of the most common cancers in women and one of the leading causes of&#xD;
      death in women worldwide. Pre-cancerous lesions (dysplasias) are detected by the screening&#xD;
      smear test at the gynecologist's office and can thus contribute to a 100% chance of cure if&#xD;
      they are clarified by a colposcopic examination as part of the dysplasia consultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To detect cervical dysplasia during colposcopic examination, the effect of diluted acetic&#xD;
      acid on the epithelium of the cervix uteri is utilized. Metaplastic epithelium and low-grade&#xD;
      dysplasia are visually noticeable by a slight white staining. Biopsies are then taken from&#xD;
      these areas for further diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The colposcopy itself and especially the colposcopic targeted biopsy of the cervix are&#xD;
      painful. Virtual reality (VR) is a new method for 360° three-dimensional viewing of image&#xD;
      content. A number of studies have shown that the use of VR can have a positive impact on the&#xD;
      course of medical interventions. Randomized studies on the effectiveness of VR in a&#xD;
      collective of women with colposcopically targeted biopsy of the cervix are not available&#xD;
      according to a recent literature search (PubMed search of 12/30/2020; search terms: cervical&#xD;
      biopsy, colposcopy, pain relief, pain control, virtual reality). In studies of our research&#xD;
      group on colposcopy, we found increased pain scores especially in younger patients, but also&#xD;
      in obese patients and smokers. A controlled study on the effectiveness of VR in&#xD;
      colposcopically targeted biopsy is therefore useful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our study, we now want to answer the question under prospective conditions whether the use&#xD;
      of VR before the start or before the start and during colposcopy compared to no intervention&#xD;
      leads to a significant increase in patient satisfaction and/or a reduction in pain in the&#xD;
      context of clarification colposcopy and colposcopically targeted biopsy.&#xD;

      HPV and cervical cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are the most common sexually transmitted pathogens worldwide.&#xD;
      The prevalence in the population is high. Epidemiological estimates suggest that 75-80% of&#xD;
      sexually active adults acquire an HPV infection in the genital area at least once by the age&#xD;
      of 50. However, up to 95% of these HPV infections are considered harmless and are&#xD;
      spontaneously eliminated within 2 years in terms of immunological HPV clearance [1]. On the&#xD;
      other hand, persistent infections with HPV of the high-risk group, e.g. HPV-16 and HPV-18,&#xD;
      are the main cause for the development of cervical carcinoma and are also partly responsible&#xD;
      for the development of vulvar carcinoma, vaginal carcinoma and anal carcinoma. HPV&#xD;
      preferentially infects the epithelial cells of the anogenital region and, through&#xD;
      incorporation of HPV DNA into the host genome and subsequent interference with the cell cycle&#xD;
      control of the host cell, causes changes in the cervical epithelium that, if left untreated,&#xD;
      may develop into precancerous lesions (so-called cervical intraepithelial neoplasia) and&#xD;
      consecutively into invasive carcinoma of the cervix (cervical carcinoma). Specifically, the&#xD;
      viral protooncogene E6 gene product couples to p53 and promotes its degradation, and the&#xD;
      viral protooncogene E7 gene product forms a complex with the retinoblastoma gene product pRB&#xD;
      and suppresses its tumor suppressor function [2]. Both the impairment of apoptosis and tumor&#xD;
      suppressor function promote immortalization of infected basal cells in the transformation&#xD;
      zone of the cervix uteri.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cervical carcinoma is the third most common cancer in women worldwide, as well as the fourth&#xD;
      leading cause of death in women worldwide. Cervical carcinoma accounted for 9% (n=529 800) of&#xD;
      all new cancer cases and 8% (n=275 100) of cancer-related deaths in women in 2008 [3].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The precursor of cervical cancer is cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), which can lead&#xD;
      to the development of squamous cell carcinoma (approximately 80% of all cervical cancers).&#xD;
      Three grades of expression are distinguished in CIN (CIN1, CIN 2, and CIN 3). Compared with&#xD;
      invasive cervical carcinoma, the occurrence of precancerous lesions of the cervix uteri is&#xD;
      more widespread. It is estimated that approximately 100,000 women in Germany develop new&#xD;
      dysplasias (CIN 1-3) annually, with a point prevalence of &gt;200,000 [3, 4].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Colposcopy as a diagnostic method&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dysplasia of the cervix typically becomes conspicuous during the gynecological screening&#xD;
      examination at the gynecologist. In this case, smears are taken from the ectocervix and&#xD;
      endocervix and assessed by the cytologist after a Papanicolaou stain has been performed with&#xD;
      regard to dysplastic cells and the quality of the smear. For further clarification of&#xD;
      dysplastic changes, presentation to a specialized dysplasia consultation is recommended.&#xD;
      During colposcopic examination, histological confirmation of dysplastic areas is performed by&#xD;
      means of biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Colposcopy (visual examination of the vagina and the entrance to the uterus with optical&#xD;
      magnification) is an integral part of early cervical cancer detection. It is used to&#xD;
      visualize dysplastic areas on the cervix uteri and to determine their spatial expression. The&#xD;
      magnifying glass allows a multilevel (3.5 to 30x) two-dimensional magnification. After visual&#xD;
      identification of suspicious areas using 5% acetic acid (dysplasias become acetic white) and&#xD;
      classification into &quot;minor&quot; (grade 1) or &quot;major&quot; (grade 2) changes according to the&#xD;
      internationally used RIO classification, a targeted biopsy for exact determination of the&#xD;
      degree of dysplasia is possible [4]. Only in this way is further individual therapy planning&#xD;
      possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain sensation during colposcopic examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Colposcopy itself and especially colposcopic targeted biopsy of the cervix are painful [4,&#xD;
      5]. General practice is to use local analgesics, oral analgesics, or no analgesics during a&#xD;
      colposcopically targeted biopsy of the cervix [5]. The use of nonpharmacologic methods to&#xD;
      positively influence patient pain perception and satisfaction has been investigated in a&#xD;
      number of studies. For example, in a prospective randomized study, our group demonstrated&#xD;
      that classical music (Mozart, Symphony No. 40 in G minor, KV 550) [6] had no positive&#xD;
      influence on satisfaction and pain perception. Similarly, in another randomized study, we&#xD;
      found no positive influence on satisfaction and pain perception by using video colposcopy&#xD;
      [7]. Virtual reality (VR) is a new method for 360° three-dimensional viewing of image&#xD;
      content. A number of studies have shown that the use of VR can have a positive effect on the&#xD;
      course of medical interventions. For example, in a systematic review and meta-analysis of 8&#xD;
      randomized trials with a total of 723 subjects, Ding et al showed lower postoperative pain&#xD;
      scores after the application of VR in the context of various surgeries such as dental, knee,&#xD;
      hemorrhoid surgery, and obstetric injury care [8].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized trials of the effectiveness of VR in a collective of women undergoing&#xD;
      colposcopy-targeted cervical biopsy are not available according to a recent literature search&#xD;
      (PubMed search as of 12/30/2020; search terms: cervical biopsy, colposcopy, pain relief, pain&#xD;
      control, virtual reality). In studies of our research group on colposcopy, we found increased&#xD;
      pain scores especially in younger patients, but also in obese patients and smokers [7, 9].&#xD;
      Therefore, a controlled study on the effectiveness of VR in colposcopy-targeted biopsy is&#xD;
      reasonable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study now aims to answer the question under prospective conditions whether the use of VR&#xD;
      before initiation or before initiation and during colposcopy compared to no intervention&#xD;
      leads to a significant increase in patient satisfaction and/or a reduction in pain in the&#xD;
      context of clarification colposcopy and colposcopically targeted biopsy.&#xD;
