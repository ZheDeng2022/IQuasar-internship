             washout (normalization) period for biological DMARDs is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Anakinra - 1 week&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Etanercept, rilonacept - 4 weeks&#xD;

                  canakinumab - 8 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Rituximab - 36 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Participant has another serious chronic-inflammatory disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Participant has a relevant, active infection or another disease, which entails a&#xD;
             tendency towards infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Participant has active macrophage activation syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Participant has the following abnormal values:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Serum creatinine concentration &gt;1.5 mg/dl.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Hemoglobin ≤ 10 g/dl, neutrophils ≤1,500 /μl and/or thrombocytes ≤75,000 /μl.&#xD;
