  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study 11 healthy volunteers will perform high intensity exercise training during 4&#xD;
      weeks. The exercise frequency will increase progressively during the first three weeks,&#xD;
      followed by a fourth week with lower exercise frequency. 5 skeletal muscle biopsies will be&#xD;
      donated throughout the study and 4 oral glucose tolerance tests will be performed after each&#xD;
      training period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      11 healthy and recreational active subjects will be recruited to the study. For inclusion and&#xD;
      assessment of baseline physiological characteristics during cycling, a pre-test will be&#xD;
      performed on a cycle ergometer and the submaximal and maximal response to exercise will be&#xD;
      determined by measurement of respiratory gas exchange. The physiological response to&#xD;
      submaximal work rate will be comprised of a series of five minutes long intervals separated&#xD;
      with one minutes of rest with assessment of capillary blood lactate and glucose at the end of&#xD;
      each workload. All physiological tests and training (HII) sessions will be carefully&#xD;
      supervised by trained personnel. The intervention period will include 14 HIIT-sessions in&#xD;
      total, all performed at the laboratory under close surveillance and careful monitoring of&#xD;
      power output and heart rate. During HIIT sessions, VO2, CO2, blood glucose, lactate and&#xD;
      rating of perceived exhaustion (BORG) will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Energy intake will be standardized for each subject during the day of test sessions. After&#xD;
      each HIIT-session a recovery drink containing 1 g · kg-1 bw of carbohydrates and 0.25 g ·&#xD;
      kg-1 bw of protein will be ingested by the subjects. After HIIT sessions, subjects will be&#xD;
      supplied with an evening meal consisting of 74 g carbohydrates, 38 g protein and 26 g fat to&#xD;
      be consumed two hours post exercise. Subjects will thereafter remain fasted until the next&#xD;
      morning for an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and donation of a muscle biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All biopsies will be collected in fasted state in early morning following 14 hour of rest&#xD;
      after the last HIIT-session. Biopsies will be taken from vastus lateralis in alternating leg&#xD;
      in randomized order.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will complete four OGTTs throughout the study. Resting metabolic rate (RMR) will&#xD;
      be measured in supine position by gas exchange measurement using mixing chamber method&#xD;
      (Oxycon Pro) attached to a ventilated hood. Thereafter the muscle biopsy will be taken and a&#xD;
      catheter will be inserted into the antecubital vein of the forearm. After 10 minutes of&#xD;
      passive rest 75 mg glucose dissolved in 300 ml water will be ingested and at 0, 15, 30, 45,&#xD;
      60 75, 90, 105- and 120-minutes after glucose intake a venous blood sample will be taken and&#xD;
      instantly analyzed for glucose with enzymatic method in the Biosen C-Line Clinic. Additional&#xD;
      RMR measurements will be performed at ~40 and 115 minutes after glucose ingestion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mitochondria will be isolated from fresh skeletal muscle biopsies. Mitochondrial respiration&#xD;
      and H2O2 emission will be measured using a two-channel high-resolution respirometer with an&#xD;
      attached fluorescent probe (Oxygraph-2k, Oroboros Instruments Corporation, Innsbruck,&#xD;
      Austria).&#xD;
