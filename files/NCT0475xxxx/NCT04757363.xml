  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out whether combining nivolumab, FOLFOX, and regorafenib&#xD;
      may be a safe and effective treatment for people who have HER2-negative metastatic&#xD;
      esophagogastric cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nivolumab is an antibody, like the proteins made by the immune system to protect the body&#xD;
      from harm. Nivolumab blocks the protein PD-1 (programmed cell death receptor-1) that usually&#xD;
      acts as a &quot;brake&quot; on the immune system. Blocking this protein is like releasing the brakes,&#xD;
      so that the immune system can target cancer cells and destroy them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FOLFOX is a combination of three standard chemotherapy drugs (leucovorin, 5-fluorouracil, and&#xD;
      oxaliplatin) commonly used to treat your type of cancer. The drugs work by damaging the DNA&#xD;
      in cancer cells, which can cause the cells to stop growing and die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regorafenib is a type of drug called a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). This drug targets the&#xD;
      tyrosine kinase protein found in or on the surface of cancer cells that the cells need to&#xD;
      survive and grow. Blocking this protein may stop cancer cells from growing, or cause them to&#xD;
      grow more slowly or to shrink.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study researchers think that combining nivolumab, FOLFOX, and regorafenib may be a more&#xD;
      effective treatment for HER2-negative metastatic esophagogastric cancer than the usual&#xD;
      chemotherapy treatment(s) alone.&#xD;

    <description>Each treatment cycle consists of 28 days. Patients will initially receive induction therapy with regorafenib (80 mg on days 1-21 of the 28-day cycle) and nivolumab (240 mg on days 1 and 15 of the 28-day cycle). Starting on cycle 2, day 1, patients will also receive FOLFOX chemotherapy with oxaliplatin (85 mg/m2 IV), leucovorin (400 mg/m2 IV), 5-FU (400 mg/m2 IV bolus), and 5-FU (2400 mg/m2/day continuous IV infusion over 48 h). If the patient is not a good candidate for induction regorafenib and nivolumab (i.e. symptomatic from a large burden of disease), 5-FU and oxaliplatin can be added during cycle 1 at the treating physician's discretion. 39 Patients will continue with this regimen until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or development of serious intercurrent illness. Treatment will be performed on the scheduled day (±7-day treatment window).</description>
