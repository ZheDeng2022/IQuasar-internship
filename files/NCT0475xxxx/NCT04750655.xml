  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators seek to determine the effect of antibiotic use post-surgery&#xD;
      on antimicrobial resistance. The investigators will be studying adults (aged 18 or older) who&#xD;
      will undergo eye surgery at University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). We seek to gain a&#xD;
      better understanding of how antibiotic use during the perioperative period influences local&#xD;
      and systemic antibiotic resistance at the individual level.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Antibiotic use has saved millions of lives globally. However, this comes at the cost of&#xD;
      selecting for antibiotic-resistant organisms at the individual and the community level. It is&#xD;
      estimated that every year, approximately 700,000 deaths are associated with drug resistance&#xD;
      globally. This places a significant burden on the public health system and the judicious use&#xD;
      of antibiotics is more important than ever before.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed masked, randomized controlled trial evaluates the effects of topical antibiotic&#xD;
      use on the selection of antibiotic resistance determinants at the local and systemic levels.&#xD;
      The results will provide guidance for antibiotic usage in ophthalmology and may have the&#xD;
      potential to inform public health policies.&#xD;
