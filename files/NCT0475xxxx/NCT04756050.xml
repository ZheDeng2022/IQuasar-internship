  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brachial plexus blocks used for anesthesia in upper extremity operations can be performed&#xD;
      with interscalene, axillary, supraclavicular and infraclavicular approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plexus blockage can be performed under the guidance of needle nerve stimulation, artery&#xD;
      palpation or ultrasonography (USG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nowadays, the simultaneous use of USG during the block allows the protection of structures&#xD;
      such as nerves, pleura and vessels, and allows practitioners to see the needle and the spread&#xD;
      of local anesthetic during the injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although supraclavicular block seems to be advantageous because the brachial plexus is more&#xD;
      compact and superficial in this region, it has a disadvantage of being close to the pleura.&#xD;
      (Increased risk of pneumothorax) With the use of USG, this risk has decreased and the&#xD;
      supraclavicular block has become an alternative to infraclavicular block, which is widely&#xD;
      used in upper extremity surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the compact structure of the brachial plexus trunk at the first rib level, the&#xD;
      application of the block is easier and the block formation is faster due to the peripheral&#xD;
      spread of the local anesthetic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the spread of local anesthetic to C3-C5 nerve roots in the brachial plexus, paralysis&#xD;
      can be seen in the ipsilateral phrenic nerve up to 67%. Patients who will be operated on,&#xD;
      especially in patients with respiratory distress, may experience respiratory distress due to&#xD;
      the dysfunction of that side diaphragm muscle. With the help of ultrasound, the inspiratory&#xD;
      and end-expiratory thickness of the diaphragm is measured with the Diaphragm Thickness Index&#xD;
      (DTI), which is a new and effective method used as a mechanical ventilator weaning index in&#xD;
      intensive care units. With this method, we can examine the effect of phrenic nerve block on&#xD;
      diaphragm muscle due to local anesthesia in the acute period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DTI is calculated as a percentage from the following formula:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Max thickness at the end of inspiration - Max thickness at the end of the expiration) / Max&#xD;
      thickness at the end of the expiration. By comparing 3 different approaches used in&#xD;
      supraclavicular block, we aimed to investigate the most appropriate block approach in terms&#xD;
      of effectiveness, speed, complication rate, effects on diaphragm and 6 months effects.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this prospective randomized double-blind study, patients will be divided into 3 groups&#xD;
      using a computer program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard monitoring (ECG, pulse oximetry, noninvasive blood pressure) will be applied to the&#xD;
      patients who will then be taken to the block application room . After the peripheral vascular&#xD;
      access is established on the hand that will not be operated on, premedication will be&#xD;
      provided with 2 mg iv midazolam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blocks will be performed by an experienced anesthesiologist with the USG guidance. Block&#xD;
      evaluation and measurements will be made by a different experienced anesthesiologist. After&#xD;
      the antisepsis of the area to be blocked, a 22G 50 mm stimulator needle will be used for the&#xD;
      block. Intermittent negative aspiration will be performed during all procedures to detect&#xD;
      possible vascular puncture. The local anesthetic mixture we routinely use in our clinic will&#xD;
      be used. 20 ml of bupivacaine(Buvicaine HCl %0.5) and prilocaine(Priloc HCl %2) 1:1 mixture&#xD;
      will be prepared in a way that there will be 5mcg adrenaline per ml.(9ml bupivacaine, 9ml&#xD;
      prilocaine and 2ml saline with 50 mcg adrenaline per ml) The ultrasound probe will be placed&#xD;
      on the clavicle, the supraclavicular block will be applied in the coronal oblique plane using&#xD;
      the in-plane technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 different approaches of supraclavicular block will be compared. Approaches share the same&#xD;
      probe position and needle entry point but differ in where the local anesthetic is given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: Local anesthetic mixture will be given to the corner pocket - where the artery and&#xD;
      the first rib intersect in the sonoanatomical image.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: 10 ml of the local anesthetic mixture will be given to the described corner pack and&#xD;
      the remaining 10 ml into the largest nerve cluster (Intracluster injection).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 3: Local anesthetic mixture will be administered by multi injection method between the&#xD;
      nerve groups seen in the sonoanatomical image.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diaphragm thickening fraction and evaluations will be made by another experienced&#xD;
      anesthesiologist, double-blindness will be achieved by being blind to the patient's group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effects of phrenic nerve block on diaphraghma muscle will be evaluated by diaphraghma&#xD;
      thickining fraction.All patients will be evaluated with USG in a head-up position facing the&#xD;
      side to be operated before and 30 minutes after the block is performed.The probe will be&#xD;
      placed perpendicular to the chest wall, in the eighth or ninth intercostal space, between the&#xD;
      anterior axillary and midaxillary lines, 0.5 to 2 cm below the costophrenic sinus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diaphragm will be viewed as a structure with three distinct layers, including two&#xD;
      parallel echoic lines (Diaphragmatic pleura and peritoneum) and a hypoechoic line between&#xD;
      them (Diaphragm muscle) . The patient will be instructed to breathe up to total lung capacity&#xD;
      (TLC) and then exhale to residual volume (RV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several diaphragm images will be taken, at least three at the point of maximum thickening in&#xD;
      TLC and at least three at minimum thickness in RV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On each B-mode image, diaphragm thickness will be measured from the middle of the pleural&#xD;
      line to the middle of the peritoneal line. Then DTI will be calculated as a percentage from&#xD;
      the following formula:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Max thickness at the end of inspiration - Max thickness at the end of the expiration) / Max&#xD;
      thickness at the end of the expiration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this formula, we can determine the involvement of phrenic nerve by looking at the rate&#xD;
      of diaphragm thickening before and after supraclavicular block in different groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a first line rescue anesthesia, patients will receive sedoanalgesia with remifentanil&#xD;
      infusion. Laryngeal mask and general anesthesia will be commenced if needed. The&#xD;
      postoperative analgesic regimen will routinely contain 1000 mg IV acetaminophen (3x1) and, if&#xD;
      necessary, 1 mg opioid (Tramadol) per kg will be given.&#xD;
