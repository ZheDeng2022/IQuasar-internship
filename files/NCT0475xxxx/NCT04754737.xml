  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intradetrusor injection of onabotulinumtoxinA, which is performed through a cystoscopic&#xD;
      procedure, has been demonstrated to be efficacious in the treatment of both neurogenic and&#xD;
      non-neurogenic overactive bladder (OAB), and is FDA approved as a treatment for overactive&#xD;
      bladder. Intradetrusor of onabotulinumtoxinA is currently standard of care of patients with&#xD;
      OAB who have persistent OAB symptoms despite behavioral therapies and oral medication&#xD;
      treatments for OAB. As one of the main adverse events associated with intradetrusor injection&#xD;
      of onabotulinumtoxinA is UTI, and published guidelines for cystoscopic procedures with&#xD;
      manipulation recommend the use of prophylactic antibiotics, a single dose of prophylactic&#xD;
      antibiotic is administered prior to this procedure. However, these recommendations are&#xD;
      primarily based on data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving antimicrobial&#xD;
      prophylaxis during transurethral resection of the prostate. A previously published&#xD;
      prospective study demonstrated that the rate of post-procedural UTI did not differ amongst&#xD;
      patients with neurogenic bladder who did not receive prophylactic antibiotics and were&#xD;
      asymptomatic for UTI, regardless of whether they had sterile urine cultures or asymptomatic&#xD;
      bacteriuria, suggesting that patients who are not symptomatic for UTI may not require&#xD;
      antibiotic prophylaxis prior to intradetrusor onabotulinumtoxinA injection. Studies have&#xD;
      reported that up to 50% of antibiotic usage is inappropriate, leading to unnecessary exposure&#xD;
      of patients to potential complications of antibiotic therapy, including Clostridium difficile&#xD;
      infection which can cause recurrent diarrhea that may progress to sepsis and death,&#xD;
      increasing antibiotic resistances, as well as dermal/allergic and gastro-intestinal&#xD;
      manifestations. Therefore, in an effort to optimize antibiotic use, the investigators propose&#xD;
      a prospective, randomized study to formally evaluate the differences in UTI frequency in&#xD;
      subjects who have a negative urinalysis and are not symptomatic for UTI and receive&#xD;
      prophylactic antibiotics at the time of intradetrusor onabotulinumtoxinA injection compared&#xD;
      to those who do not receive prophylactic antibiotics at the time of injection. The proposed&#xD;
      study seeks to evaluate the current practice standard of antibiotic prophylaxis prior to&#xD;
      intradetrusor onabotulinumtoxin injection.&#xD;

      Intradetrusor injection of onabotulinumtoxinA, which is performed thorough a cystoscopic&#xD;
      procedure, has been demonstrated to be efficacious in the treatment of both neurogenic and&#xD;
      non-neurogenic overactive bladder (OAB), and is FDA approved as a treatment for OAB.&#xD;
      Intradetrusor of onabotulinumtoxinA is currently standard of care in patients with persistent&#xD;
      OAB symptoms despite behavioral therapies and oral medication treatments for OAB. As one of&#xD;
      the main adverse events associated with intradetrusor injection of onabotulinumtoxinA is UTI,&#xD;
      and published guidelines for cystoscopic procedures with manipulation recommend the use of&#xD;
      prophylactic antibiotics, a single dose of prophylactic antibiotic is administered prior to&#xD;
      this procedure as the current standard of care. However, the guideline recommendations are&#xD;
      primarily based on data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving antimicrobial&#xD;
      prophylaxis during transurethral resection of the prostate, and does not address cystoscopic&#xD;
      injection procedures like onabotulinumtoxinA injection. Studies have reported that up to 50%&#xD;
      of antibiotic usage is inappropriate, leading to unnecessary exposure of patients to&#xD;
      potential complications of antibiotic therapy, including Clostridium difficile infection&#xD;
      which can cause recurrent diarrhea that may progress to sepsis and death, increasing&#xD;
      antibiotic resistances, as well as dermal/allergic and gastro-intestinal manifestations. In&#xD;
      an effort to optimize antibiotic usage, antimicrobial stewardship is required in nursing&#xD;
      facilities, acute-care and critical care hospitals, as well as ambulatory care centers. These&#xD;
      efforts highlight the importance of re-evaluating our current practice standard of&#xD;
      prophylactic antibiotic administration in urologic procedures. A prospective study that&#xD;
      included patients undergoing intradetrusor onabutulinumtoxin injections who were not&#xD;
      symptomatic for UTI and did not receive antibiotic prophylaxis demonstrated that the rate of&#xD;
      post-procedure UTI within 6 weeks of treatment was not significantly different in those with&#xD;
      a sterile urine culture compared to those with asymptomatic bacteriuria, suggesting that in&#xD;
      patients who are not symptomatic for UTI, antibiotic prophylaxis may not be necessary prior&#xD;
      to intradetrusor onabotulinumtoxin injection. To date, there have been no randomized studies&#xD;
      that evaluate differences in outcomes when prophylactic antibiotics are not given prior to&#xD;
      onabotulinumtoxinA injection. Therefore, in an effort to optimize antibiotic use, the&#xD;
      investigators propose a prospective, randomized study to formally investigate whether there&#xD;
      is a difference in the rate of symptomatic post-procedure UTI after intradetrusor&#xD;
      onabotulinumtoxin when antibiotic prophylaxis is given compared to when antibiotic&#xD;
      prophylaxis is not given in patients who are not symptomatic for UTI and have a negative&#xD;
      urinalysis. The proposed study seeks to evaluate the current practice standard of antibiotic&#xD;
      prophylaxis prior to intradetrusor onabotulinumtoxin injection.&#xD;
