      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized, open-label and parallel clinical trial, assigned to early, mid, or late&#xD;
      withdrawal of urinary catheter with a 1: 1: 1 allocation ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POPULATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergoing anterior rectal resection, low rectal resection, or abdominoperineal&#xD;
      amputation for any reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to compare the incidence of acute urine retention after removal of the&#xD;
      urinary catheter in the postoperative period of rectal resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Incidence of urinary tract infection after urinary catheter removal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Incidence of specific postoperative complications (Surgical wound infection, Respiratory&#xD;
           infection, Anastomotic dehiscence, ileus).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Incidence of postoperative complications assessed according to the Comprehensive&#xD;
           Complication Index (CCI) scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESCRIPTION OF THE INTERVENTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all patients, a Rectal Resection (anterior rectal resection, posterior pelvic exenteration&#xD;
      or abdominoperineal amputation) will be performed. In group 1A, the urinary catheter will be&#xD;
      removed on the 1st postoperative day. In group 1B patients, the urinary catheter will be&#xD;
      removed on the 3rd postoperative day. In group 1C patients, the urinary catheter will be&#xD;
      removed on the 5th postoperative day. All patients will have a urine culture taken at the&#xD;
      time of withdrawal.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently there is a trend towards prolonged urinary catheterization in patients undergoing&#xD;
      rectal resection surgery. However, there are studies that defend although there is a slight&#xD;
      increase in AUR in these patients, it can be withdrawn early in a safe way with a lower&#xD;
      incidence of UTI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to analyse whether there are differences in the incidence of AUR in&#xD;
      rectal surgery patients and to observe whether it has an impact on other postoperative&#xD;
      complications. A randomized clinical trial is proposed to compare an early, mid or late&#xD;
      removal of the urinary catheter in patients with rectal resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Potential Risks and Benefits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both techniques, both early and late withdrawal, are approved practices that are carried out&#xD;
      in a standardized way in the current practice. There are no potential risks associated with&#xD;
      the study intervention, beyond the intrinsic risks of the procedure itself.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Objectives of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objective: to compare the incidence of acute urine retention after removal of the&#xD;
      urinary catheter in the postoperative period of rectal resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Incidence of urinary tract infection after urinary catheter removal. Incidence of specific&#xD;
      postoperative complications (surgical wound infection, respiratory infection, anastomotic&#xD;
      dehiscence, ileus).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Incidence of postoperative complications assessed according to the Comprehensive Complication&#xD;
      Index (CCI) scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Demographic: sex, date of birth, BMI, ASA, Benign Prostate Hyperplasia, surgical&#xD;
                history, usual treatment, date of diagnosis of the tumor, neoadjuvant treatment,&#xD;
                tumor stage (TNM).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Preoperative evaluation: IPSS (International Prostate Syndrome Score) for&#xD;
                evaluation of preoperative urinary function in men.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Surgical treatment: date of surgery, antibiotic prophylaxis, type of surgical&#xD;
                approach, blood volume administered during surgery, mechanical preparation of the&#xD;
                colon, type of surgery, ligation of the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA), need for&#xD;
                intraoperative transfusion, duration of intervention, bleeding, intraoperative&#xD;
                complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Postoperative evolution: Acute retention of urine, urinary tract infection,&#xD;
                surgical wound infection, respiratory infection, paralytic ileus, blood volume&#xD;
                administered postoperatively, postoperative complications (ICC), date of diagnosis,&#xD;
                reoperation, hospital stay, postoperative mortality and readmission .&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Evolution and follow-up: Need for catheterization, removal of urinary catheter,&#xD;
                urinary tract infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Definitions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Postoperative morbidity includes all postoperative complications that occurred during&#xD;
           the first 30 postoperative days. Complications will be evaluated according to the CCI&#xD;
           (classification that considers the accumulation of complications based on the&#xD;
           Clavien-Dindo scale).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Severe prostate symptomatology is considered to be an IPSS score (established&#xD;
           questionnaire for prostate symptoms) greater than 20.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urinary catheter placement is considered to be the placement of a catheter through the&#xD;
           urethra, always performed under antiseptic conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AUR is considered the impossibility of urine output despite urinary desire and at least&#xD;
           30 minutes, or anuria of 8 hours after the removal of the UC with a retention of more&#xD;
           than 250 mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  UTI is defined as a positive urine culture with&gt; 10 5 bacterial colonies / mL of urine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Respiratory infection is considered a positive sputum culture and / or a chest&#xD;
           radiograph with parenchymal condensations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The wound infection is considered deep, superficial or parastomal according to the CDC&#xD;
           (Center for Disease Control) criteria for wound infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A delay in oral tolerance due to vomiting, abdominal distention or the need for&#xD;
           nasogastric tube placement will be considered ileus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anastomotic dehiscence and its severity is defined according to the International Study&#xD;
           Group of Rectal Cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Postoperative mortality is defined as death within the first 90 days after surgery or&#xD;
           before hospital discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Readmission is defined as admission to the hospital within 30 days of discharge from the&#xD;
           hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is considered to be that received prior to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The duration of the surgical intervention is considered the time from the beginning of&#xD;
           the skin section to the end of the last skin point, calculated in minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The volume administered during the surgery is considered the volume of fluids&#xD;
           administered by the venous route from the induction of anesthesia to the extubation of&#xD;
           the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A high ligation of the IMA is considered to be the ligation that is performed about 2 cm&#xD;
           from the root of the IMA, preserving the superior hypogastric plexus. Low ligation of&#xD;
           the IMA is considered one that is distal to the bifurcation of the IMA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Randomized clinical trial, with an allocation ratio of 1: 1: 1, controlled, of&#xD;
                patients undergoing rectal resection surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The study population is hospitalized patients, who underwent anterior rectal&#xD;
                resection, low anterior rectal resection or abdominoperineal amputation of any&#xD;
                etiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  It is a single-center trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The expected recruitment period is 36 months. The follow-up time of the patients in&#xD;
                the study is 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The approximate duration of the study is 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calculation of the sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to published clinical trials, up to 30% of rectal surgery patients who have VS&#xD;
      removed will have an AUR for the first POD. The estimated risk of AUR after removal of VS on&#xD;
      the 3rd PDO is 5%. If a confidence level at 95% is set and a statistical power of 80% is&#xD;
      desired and having an expected proportion of losses of 10% in each group, the sample size&#xD;
      should be 48 in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization process:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who meet the inclusion criteria for the study will be randomized using random number&#xD;
      generator functions with the SPSS v.25 program in the UC withdrawal group on the first, third&#xD;
      and fifth postoperative days. The randomization will be 1: 1: 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allocation concealment will be done by sealed opaque envelopes. The envelope will be opened&#xD;
      inside the operating room at the beginning of the surgical procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Masking process:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients, surgeons, and research staff know the intervention group to which the patient have&#xD;
      been assigned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dropouts, withdrawals and losses&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dropouts: patients included in a clinical trial who are unwilling or unable to continue&#xD;
           in the study or in follow-up.&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Description of the intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Management common to all patients included in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lithotomy position for surgery, regardless of whether it is subsequently modified to the&#xD;
      prone position. Laparotomy or laparoscopic surgery, performing Anterior Rectum Resection,&#xD;
      Lower Anterior Resection, with or without anastomosis or Abdominoperineal Resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transurethral 16 Fr Foley catheter placement. Balanced general anesthesia, with or without&#xD;
      epidural catheter, at the discretion of the responsible anesthesiologist. Avoid hydric&#xD;
      overload and favor normothermia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Positioning of the usual trocars (but modifiable according to the surgeon's preferences). An&#xD;
      oncological or transmesorectal mesorectal dissection will be performed according to the needs&#xD;
      of each patient, always trying to identify the upper and lower hypogastric plexus, without&#xD;
      injuring them. The inferior mesenteric artery will be cut at least 2 cm from the root to&#xD;
      avoid the superior hypogastric plexus or a distal ligation with preservation of the left&#xD;
      colic artery. The extraction of the sample will be by a Minipfannenstiel, laparotomy or&#xD;
      perineum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In group 1A, the UC will be removed in the first 24 hours after surgery, accompanied by a&#xD;
      urine culture taken from UC. In group 1B, the UC will be removed approximately 72 hours after&#xD;
      surgery, accompanied by a urine culture taken for UC. In group 1C, the UC will be removed&#xD;
      approximately 96 hours after surgery, accompanied by a urine culture taken from UC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In cases of APR, the UC will be replaced, which will be maintained for at least 4 more days,&#xD;
      at which point its removal will be attempted again along with taking another urine culture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complications data will be collected together with the other variables in the data collection&#xD;
      sheet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The other fast-track principles approved by different participating centers will be applied.&#xD;
