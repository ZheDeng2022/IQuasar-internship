  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preoperative anxiety is a major concern for patients who undergo surgery. To accurately&#xD;
      identify anxious patient is therefore crucial to improve perioperative patient care.&#xD;
      Preoperative anxiety remain highly difficult to quantify in current practice. Many patient&#xD;
      fail to express their anxiety and the assessment of the level of anxiety is mainly based on&#xD;
      heteroevaluation by caregivers. Nurse anesthetists provide closed support to patient prior to&#xD;
      the induction of anesthesia. The aim of the study is to assess whether nurse anesthetist&#xD;
      accurately assess patient preoperative anxiety from arrival to the operating room to the&#xD;
      induction of anesthesia.&#xD;

      EVALANXI is a single-center prospective observational study. The main objective of the study&#xD;
      is to assess whether the assessment of preoperative anxiety by nurse anesthetist&#xD;
      (hetero-assessment) accurately estimate the level of anxiety reported by the patient from&#xD;
      arrival to the operating room to the induction of anesthesia (self-assessment).&#xD;
