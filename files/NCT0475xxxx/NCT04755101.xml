      The third study on CardNM (CardNMH3 study) is a multicenter, double-blind, randomized trial&#xD;
      with a sham control group investigating the efficacy and safety of a computed tomography&#xD;
      (CT)-guided, right-sided ablation of the anterior ganglionated plexus to prevent recurrence&#xD;
      of syncope in patients with neurally mediated syncope (NMS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal of the study is to determine whether a CT-guided, right-sided ablation of&#xD;
      the anterior ganglionated plexus safely reduces the risk of recurrent episodes of syncope in&#xD;
      patients with a history of recurrent NMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two-third of the patients will be randomized to the active arm and one-third to the control&#xD;
      arm (sham).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study procedure is described in the 'detailed description' and 'intervention&#xD;
      description'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Syncope burden, syncope occurrence and quality of life will be assessed by questionnaires at&#xD;
      baseline and at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months. A 24-h rhythm registration will be performed at&#xD;
      baseline and at 1-, 3- and 6-month follow-up to investigate the influence of the intervention&#xD;
      on heart rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of CardNM on blood pressure and on chronotropic sinus node function will be&#xD;
      evaluated in 2 additional substudies. Patients enrolled in the blood-pressure substudy will&#xD;
      undergo a 24-h blood pressure monitoring at baseline and at 1, 3 and 6 months. Participants&#xD;
      in the sinus node competence substudy will undergo a bicycle exercise test at baseline and at&#xD;
      1, 3 and 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators aim to achieve complete follow-up for 110 patients who meet the study&#xD;
      enrollment criteria. If syncope-free survival (primary endpoint) is significantly different&#xD;
      between the 2 arms after the enrollment of fewer than 110 patients (minimum 55 patients),&#xD;
      enrollment into the trial will be prematurely stopped. The study may also be terminated&#xD;
      prematurely if safety concerns occur.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The efficacy of therapeutic strategies mentioned in the guidelines for patients with neurally&#xD;
      mediated syncope (NMS) is limited. The first clinical study on cardiac denervation in humans&#xD;
      was published in 2005. Derived from this first method, different approaches to&#xD;
      cardioneuroablation (CNA) to treat NMS have been published. Such ablations are complex,&#xD;
      bi-atrial, and extensive. Cardio-neuromodulation (CardNM) is a less extensive and right-sided&#xD;
      approach to CNA, based on a tailored vagolysis of the sinoatrial node through partial&#xD;
      ablation of the anterior right-ganglionated plexus. Evidence from a single-center,&#xD;
      non-randomized, unblinded trial showed that CardNM was associated with a reduction in syncope&#xD;
      burden exceeding 90%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This third study on CardNM (CardNMH3 study) is a multicenter, double-blind, randomized trial&#xD;
      with a sham control group investigating the efficacy and safety of a computed tomography&#xD;
      (CT)-guided, right-sided ablation of the anterior ganglionated plexus to prevent recurrence&#xD;
      of syncope in patients with neurally mediated syncope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal of the study is to determine whether a CT-guided, right-sided ablation of&#xD;
      the anterior ganglionated plexus safely reduces the risk of recurrent episodes of syncope in&#xD;
      patients with a history of recurrent NMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two-thirds of the patients will be randomized to the active arm and one-third to the control&#xD;
      arm (sham).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all patients, the endocardial site to potentially target during ablation will be annotated&#xD;
      before the procedure by a target line (TL) on a computed tomographic image of the heart&#xD;
      imported into the CARTO system (Biosense Webster, Diamond Bar, CA), as detailed in the&#xD;
      'intervention description'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study procedure will be performed under general anesthesia according to a standardized&#xD;
      protocol. In all patients, a diagnostic electrophysiology study (EPS) and electroanatomical&#xD;
      mapping of the right atrium and the surrounding veins will be performed first. This image&#xD;
      will be merged with the CT image and the TL will be visible. Randomization will be performed&#xD;
      electronically at this stage of the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients assigned to the active arm, the TL will be targeted by ablation as detailed in&#xD;
      the intervention description'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ablation procedure is considered complete when one of the following conditions is&#xD;
      fulfilled:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 10 radiofrequency applications have been delivered;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. After 5 radiofrequency applications, the P-P interval is &lt;70% of the baseline procedural&#xD;
           P-P interval and remains &gt;550 ms 5 min after the last radiofrequency application;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. ≥5 radiofrequency applications have been delivered and the operator estimates that no&#xD;
           additional P-P interval shortening will be obtained by additional radiofrequency&#xD;
           applications;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. 3 radiofrequency applications have been delivered and the P-P interval is &lt;550 ms after&#xD;
           the last radiofrequency application and remains stable after 5 min of waiting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all patients, a pharmacological evaluation and new diagnostic EPS will be performed to&#xD;
      further evaluate the sinus node and atrioventricular nodal intrinsic activity at the end of&#xD;
      the procedure, either after the diagnostic part of the procedure in the sham group or after&#xD;
      the ablation in the active arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Syncope burden, syncope occurrence and quality of life will be assessed by questionnaires&#xD;
      completed at baseline and at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months. A 24-h rhythm registration will be&#xD;
      performed at baseline and at 1-, 3- and 6-month follow-up to investigate the influence of the&#xD;
      intervention on heart rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of CardNM on blood pressure and on chronotropic sinus node function will be&#xD;
      evaluated in 2 additional substudies. Patients enrolled in the blood-pressure substudy will&#xD;
      undergo a 24-h blood pressure monitoring at baseline and at 1, 3 and 6 months. Participants&#xD;
      in the sinus node competence substudy will undergo a bicycle exercise test at baseline and at&#xD;
      1, 3 and 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators aim to achieve complete follow-up for 110 patients who meet the study&#xD;
      enrollment criteria. If the syncope-free survival, the primary endpoint of the study, is&#xD;
      significantly different between the 2 arms after the enrollment of fewer than 110 patients&#xD;
      (minimum 55 patients), enrollment into the trial will be prematurely stopped. The study may&#xD;
      also be terminated prematurely if safety concerns occur.&#xD;
