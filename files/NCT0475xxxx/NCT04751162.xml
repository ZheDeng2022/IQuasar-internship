  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current research is a non-interventional (NIS) study seeking to support objective&#xD;
      Performance Status (PS) assessments in the particular context of metastatic NSCLC adult&#xD;
      patients. To do so, the study comprises two phases. Phase I addresses a feasibility&#xD;
      mixed-methods (quantitative-qualitative) approach. It primarily focuses on examining&#xD;
      perceived technology usability in a limited sample of participants and feasibility of&#xD;
      translating the actigraph data into PS scores (focus expert group). Phase II focuses on to&#xD;
      primarily examine associations between technology collected data and ECOG-PS in a larger&#xD;
      sample of participants.&#xD;

             decision of attended oncologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from study entry:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any medical or social condition deemed by the investigator to be likely to interfere&#xD;
             with a participant's ability to sign informed consent, cooperate and participate in&#xD;
             the study, or interfere with the interpretation of the results.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Severe infections within 4 weeks prior to randomization including but not limited to&#xD;
             hospitalization for complications of infection, bacteremia, or severe pneumonia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major surgical procedure within 4 weeks prior to randomization or anticipation of need&#xD;
             for a major surgical procedure during the course of the study other than for&#xD;
