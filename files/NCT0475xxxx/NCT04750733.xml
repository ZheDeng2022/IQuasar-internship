  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Optimal trunk control relies on somatosensory, motor and musculoskeletal integrity, which is&#xD;
      often damaged in multiple sclerosis (MS). Researches on postural control in people with MS&#xD;
      (PwMS) have revealed that reduced somatosensory conduction may adversely affect some&#xD;
      functions. PwMS have increased postural sway in upright posture than healthy people. They&#xD;
      move closer and slower when reaching out or taking a step. Trunk controls are weak and&#xD;
      postural responses are delayed. The activation of core muscles is very important for an&#xD;
      effective trunk control. Because the core region is considered a kinetic link that&#xD;
      facilitates the transfer of torque and angular momentum between the upper and lower&#xD;
      extremities during body movements. The decrease in core stability affects both trunk control&#xD;
      and the quality of limb movements due to the kinetic chain in the body. There are a limited&#xD;
      number of studies in the literature showing that core stability is reduced in PwMS. Our&#xD;
      knowledge about the effects of this reduction on function in PwMS is very limited.&#xD;

      The aim of this study is to evaluate core strength and endurance and determine its effect on&#xD;
      postural control, knee muscle strength, physical capacity and fatigue parameters in&#xD;
      individuals with MS. Also relationship between these parameters will investigate.&#xD;

    <measure>Physical capacity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Two-minute walk test (2-MWT) will be used to evaluate the mobility of the people with MS. 2-MWT is a measure of self-paced walking ability and functional capacity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>Mobility</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Timed Up and Go (TUG) will be used. TUG is a test used to determine fall risk and measure the progress of balance, sit to stand and walking.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fatigue</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) will be used to evaluate fatigue levels. This scale evaluates the severity of fatigue with 9 questions. Each question scores between 1 (I do not agree) and 7 (fully agree). The FSS score is the average value of nine sections. A high score indicates increased fatigue severity.</description>
