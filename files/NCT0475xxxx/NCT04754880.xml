  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The presence of chronic blockage of coronary arteries, which we may accept as the terminal&#xD;
      point of atherosclerotic coronary artery disease, is closely associated with a poor&#xD;
      prognosis. The Discovery of markers that may distinguish patients with a high risk of chronic&#xD;
      total occlusion development among patients monitored with the diagnosis of stable coronary&#xD;
      artery disease may be important for being able to reduce the increased mortality and&#xD;
      morbidity rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxidative stress status may be one of the markers that play a role in and/or show the&#xD;
      development of chronic total occlusion. It was reported that it has a role in the&#xD;
      progression, erosion, and instability of atherosclerotic plaques in coronary arteries. To the&#xD;
      best of our knowledge, the relationship between chronic total occlusion development and&#xD;
      oxidative stress status in stable coronary artery disease has not been studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study investigated the relationships in the oxidative stress status evaluated over TAS,&#xD;
      TOS, OSI, Thiol/Disulfide Homeostasis, and antioxidative vitamin levels and possible&#xD;
      differences in patients with noncritical coronary artery disease and those with chronic total&#xD;
      occlusion.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic total occlusion (CTO) is defined as the complete blockage of the coronary artery&#xD;
      characterized by a TIMI 0 flow present for at least 3 months. The presence of chronic&#xD;
      blockage of coronary arteries, which we may accept as the terminal point of atherosclerotic&#xD;
      coronary artery disease, is closely associated with a poor prognosis. In coronary angiography&#xD;
      tests conducted due to stable angina pectoris, it was observed that the incidence of chronic&#xD;
      total occlusion varied in the range of 15-30%. Moreover, its actual incidence in society is&#xD;
      unknown as it is generally asymptomatic. The Discovery of markers that may distinguish&#xD;
      patients with a high risk of chronic total occlusion development among patients monitored&#xD;
      with the diagnosis of stable coronary artery disease may be important for being able to&#xD;
      reduce the increased mortality and morbidity rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxidative stress status may be one of the markers that play a role in and/or show the&#xD;
      development of chronic total occlusion. Reactive oxygen species which show an increase in the&#xD;
      case of oxidative stress emerging by increased production of oxidants on the cellular level&#xD;
      or a reduced antioxidant system result in disorders on the tissue and organ levels as a&#xD;
      result of the damages they induce on DNA, protein, and lipid structures. It was reported that&#xD;
      it has a role in the progression, erosion, and instability of atherosclerotic plaques in&#xD;
      coronary arteries. Furthermore, the relationship between oxidative stress and the progression&#xD;
      of atherosclerosis in coronary arteries has been usually studied in acute coronary syndrome&#xD;
      patients. To the best of our knowledge, the relationship between chronic total occlusion&#xD;
      development and oxidative stress status in stable coronary artery disease has not been&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study investigated the relationships in the oxidative stress status evaluated over TAS,&#xD;
      TOS, OSI, Thiol/Disulfide Homeostasis, and antioxidative vitamin levels and possible&#xD;
      differences in patients with noncritical coronary artery disease and those with chronic total&#xD;
      occlusion.&#xD;
