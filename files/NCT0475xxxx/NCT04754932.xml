  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to examine the feasibility of implementing Cognitive Stimulation Therapy&#xD;
      (CST) under real world circumstances in a more heterogenous population, with the ultimate&#xD;
      goal of making the treatment broadly accessible. The effects of CST on the behavioral and&#xD;
      psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) as a non-pharmacologic intervention will also be&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;

    <description>Focus groups will be held to better understand the barriers and facilitators to adoption at both the setting level and individual level. These focus groups will also be used to assess implementation by gathering data on adherence to the prescribed CST protocol and any adaptations made to the CST intervention.&#xD;
Implementation fidelity will be assessed by direct observation of the CST groups by members of the research team using a checklist to describe adherence to key components of the protocol. Implementation barriers will be assessed through the use of focus groups and questionnaires. Based on collected data on implementation barriers and process measures, we will develop strategies to improve fidelity of the intervention and to enhance reach.</description>
