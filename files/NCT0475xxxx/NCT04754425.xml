  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the effect of erdafitinib in treating patients with prostate&#xD;
      cancer that grows and continues to spread despite the surgical removal of the testes or drugs&#xD;
      to block androgen production (castration-resistant). Erdafitinib may stop the growth of tumor&#xD;
      cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving erdafitinib may help&#xD;
      control disease in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer. In addition, studying&#xD;
      samples of blood, tissue, plasma, and bone marrow from patients with castration-resistant&#xD;
      prostate cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in&#xD;
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and identify biomarkers related to cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate efficacy of erdafitinib in subjects with advanced prostate cancer who have&#xD;
      progressed on a second-generation androgen receptor (AR)-targeting agents (SART).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the objective response rate. II. To measure time on treatment (ToT) as a&#xD;
      surrogate of clinical efficacy and progression-free survival (PFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To measure PFS. IV. To correlate bone specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP) modulation&#xD;
      with response and ToT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To correlate prostate specific antigen (PSA) modulation with response and ToT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To characterize the safety profile of subjects treated with erdafitinib. VII. To measure&#xD;
      overall survival. VIII. To collect and archive bone marrow biopsies and aspirates, serum and&#xD;
      plasma in study patients for later hypothesis generating associations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate DNA, ribonucleic acid (RNA), or protein biomarkers in tissue and blood samples&#xD;
      which potentially predict tumor response or resistance to erdafitinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive erdafitinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Cycles repeat every 21&#xD;
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients may also&#xD;
      undergo collection of blood and bone marrow via biopsy and aspirates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 16 weeks for&#xD;
      1 year, and then every 6 months thereafter.&#xD;
