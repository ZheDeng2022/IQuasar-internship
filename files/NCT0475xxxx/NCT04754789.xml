  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inflammation plays a key role in the occurrence and development of atherosclerosis(.T&#xD;
      lymphocytes are among the earliest cells to be recruited into the atherosclerotic plaque.The&#xD;
      combination of macrophages and lymphocytes in vulnerable plaque is associated with the&#xD;
      secretion of cytokines and lytic enzymes that result in thinning of the fibrous cap,&#xD;
      predisposing a lesion to rupture.The neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is an indicator of&#xD;
      systemic inflammation and a prognostic marker in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary&#xD;
      intervention (PCI).In previous studies, the NLR has been demonstrated to be related to&#xD;
      in-hospital cardiovascular mortality and long-term mortality in patients with ST segment&#xD;
      elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to its beneficial lipid modulation effects, statins exert a variety of&#xD;
      pleiotropic actions such as inflammatory inhibition, antiventricular remodeling, improving&#xD;
      vascular endothelial function, and antioxidant effects. Because ofitsmultiple functions,&#xD;
      atorvastatin therapy was associated with a significant reduction in cardiovascular morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality both in primary and secondary prevention. The Myocardial Ischemia Reduction&#xD;
      with Aggressive Cholesterol Lowering (MIRACL)study demonstrated thatatorvastatin 80 mg which&#xD;
      was given during the first days after an ACS decreased the rate of major adverse&#xD;
      cardiovascular events (MACE). This effect was observed as early as 6 weeks after&#xD;
      randomization and was significant at 16 weeks. Atorvastatin for Reduction of MYocardial&#xD;
      Damage during Angioplasty (ARMYDA) trial demonstrated a reduction in peri-procedural&#xD;
      myocardial infarction (MI) in patients with stable CAD undergoing PCI preloaded by high&#xD;
      potency statins atorvastatin 80 mg. The ARMYDARECAPTURE study showed a reduction in 30 days&#xD;
      MACE in patients with stable angina or with non-ST elevation MI who were previously treated&#xD;
      with statins and were reloaded with high potency statins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prompt effect that was observed with high-potency statins is one of the cornerstones of&#xD;
      the plaque stabilization hypothesis, in which a clinical effect is demonstrated well before&#xD;
      the low levels of low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-c) can affect plaque progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of high vs. low potency statins in ACS was examined by the Pravastatin or&#xD;
      Atorvastatin. ThePCI PROVE IT, a sub-study of the PROVE IT-TIMI 22 trial, demonstrated that&#xD;
      patients pretreated with high potency statins before PCI had a significantly lower rate of&#xD;
      target vessel revascularization. TheIn-vitro models showed that statins given prior to PCI&#xD;
      decrease distal embolization and increase circulating endothelial progenitor cells, thus&#xD;
      potentially increase endothelial healing following the injury caused by PCI. In addition,&#xD;
      patients undergoing elective PCI, which were pre-treated with statins, had less&#xD;
      microcirculatory resistance compared to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conversely, the STATIN STEMI Trial did not show a significant reduction of MACEs in patients&#xD;
      preloaded with high-dose (80 mg) versus low-dose (10 mg) atorvastatin before primary PCI&#xD;
      (5.8% versus 0.6%, p=0.26) but showed improved immediate coronary flow after primary PCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, in the SECURE-PCI trial, the periprocedural loading doses of atorvastatin did&#xD;
      not reduce the rate of MACE at 30 days in ACS patients.However, the subgroup analysis showed&#xD;
      a significant reduction of MACE in STEMI patients preloaded with atorvastatin compared with&#xD;
      the placebo (P=0.01), still not all patients were treated with primary PCI.&#xD;
