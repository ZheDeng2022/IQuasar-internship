  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to investigate whether the addition of immersive virtual&#xD;
      reality (VR) in the immediate postoperative period to an enhanced recovery after surgery&#xD;
      (ERAS) protocol could improve postoperative recovery from bariatric surgery.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose conducting a randomized, controlled, single-center clinical trial&#xD;
      of patients recovering from laparoscopic bariatric surgery. The objective is to investigate&#xD;
      whether the use of virtual reality (VR) during the immediate postoperative period could&#xD;
      improve patient reported quality of recovery and potentially reduce opioid analgesic&#xD;
      requirements as compared to an existing ERAS protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that immersive VR will improve subjective quality of recovery&#xD;
      scores at time of Post Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) discharge as compared to standard ERAS.&#xD;

    <description>The primary outcome of this study will be patient reported quality of recovery at time of PACU discharge, as assessed by the QOR-15.

    <description>Patients in the immersive VR group will don a VR headset connected to a software platform on a tablet, as well as noise cancelling headphones. Patients can choose their desired experience within the VR software from a selection of immersive environments and/or video content. Examples include sitting in a canoe on a river, on a peaceful meadow or in a forest. Patients also have the option to listen to guided meditation or select from a library of videos to watch on a web-based user interface.&#xD;
Patients in the VR group will also be treated according to the existing enhanced recovery after surgery protocol.</description>
