  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical activity has been described by the US federal government as a 'best buy' for public&#xD;
      health. Unfortunately, most adults in the United States are not sufficiently active, and this&#xD;
      worsens with age. Low levels of participation are driven by many challenging barriers,&#xD;
      including lack of access, few opportunities for enjoyable activity, and few supportive social&#xD;
      relationships, which is especially important given the central role of social connection for&#xD;
      lasting behavior change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A half-century of research in behavioral sciences has generated effective group-based&#xD;
      physical activity programs, but these are inaccessible to most as they are often delivered in&#xD;
      a few select research centers. Recent advances in telehealth have offered media for extending&#xD;
      these interventions more broadly, but the experience of such programs is often hampered by&#xD;
      technology that does not allow for a sense of physical and social presence. Fortunately,&#xD;
      uptake of virtual reality (VR) is increasing rapidly, and the medium has a high level of&#xD;
      potential for advancing the delivery of immersive evidence-based group interventions to those&#xD;
      that most need it. Thus our specific aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aim 1: To test the feasibility and acceptability of a group-mediated physical&#xD;
      activity intervention delivered fully via modern VR to older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aim 2: To examine the impact of this program on overall physical activity among&#xD;
      older adults compared to the current standard-of-care for telehealth: the video conference&#xD;
      meeting platform.&#xD;
