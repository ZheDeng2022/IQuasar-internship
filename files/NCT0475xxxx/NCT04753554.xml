      In our study, we aimed to observe the usability of non-invasive monitoring methods in&#xD;
      oxygenation management, using non-invasive monitoring techniques, preventing hyperoxia and&#xD;
      avoiding oxidative damage-related complications in patients undergoing on-pump cardiac&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In on-pump cardiac surgery; The risk of organ perfusion disorders is high due to the&#xD;
      heart-lung pump process they involve. It is essential to avoid hypoxia in such patient groups&#xD;
      in order to prevent perfusion disorders. While preventing hypoxia, hyperoxia processes can be&#xD;
      observed frequently in patients. In order to avoid complications related to hyperoxia and&#xD;
      oxidative damage, oxygenation management should be followed closely. Today, non-invasive&#xD;
      monitoring methods are being used in this field. In our study, we aimed to observe the&#xD;
      usability of this method in oxygenation management and avoidance of hyperoxia by performing&#xD;
      oxygenation management over ORI (oxygene reserve index) value using the Masimo Root + Radical&#xD;
      7 Rainbow SET device with SPHB finger probe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      30 patients will bi included in our study; and they will be divided into two groups: In one&#xD;
      group oxygenation management will be performed by conventional method, such as blood gas&#xD;
      analysis. In other group ORI values will be used to manage oxygenation. Lung ultrasound will&#xD;
      be performed in both groups to see if there will be any sign for atelectasis, preoperatively&#xD;
      and postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kidney and liver functions will also be investigated before and after surgery. For cognitive&#xD;
      disfunction evaluation; CAM-ICU scores will be recorded in both groups at 24 hours after the&#xD;
      operation.&#xD;
