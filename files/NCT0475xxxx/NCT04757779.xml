  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anlotinib hydrochloride is a multi-target antiangiogenic drug. It was recommended by Chinese&#xD;
      Society of Clinical Oncology(CSCO) guideline as a third-line treatment for advanced&#xD;
      small-cell lung cancer. This study intends to assess the efficacy and safety of anlotinib&#xD;
      hydrochloride combined with irinotecan or docetaxel for second line treatment of nonsensitive&#xD;
      relapsed small-cell lung cancer.&#xD;
