  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP) is the most commonly used technique&#xD;
      for diagnosis and treatment in the treatment of bile duct diseases including bile duct&#xD;
      cholelithiasis and malignant/benign biliary obstruction. In particular, ERCP is an essential&#xD;
      procedure for the removal of bile duct gallstones and bile drainage in malignant/benign&#xD;
      biliary obstruction patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among ERCP-related complications, especially &quot;post-ERCP pancreatitis (PEP)&quot;, which occurs due&#xD;
      to the anatomical structure of the pancreatic biliary system, statistically occurs in about&#xD;
      5-10% of patients who first received ERCP. It is known, and treatment for PEP is the same as&#xD;
      treatment for general acute pancreatitis but is known to have a relatively worse prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The basis of treatment for acute pancreatitis is a conservative treatment based on fasting&#xD;
      and fluid treatment, and starting oral diet after abdominal pain and pancreatic enzyme levels&#xD;
      (amylase/lipase) normalized. However, a recent study reported that early oral diet could&#xD;
      improve the patient's prognosis. According to a systematic review of 11 randomized trial&#xD;
      papers by Valerie et al., it was reported that the early diet had the effect of reducing&#xD;
      hospital stay without increasing adverse events when comparing the prognosis of the early&#xD;
      refeeding group and delayed refeeding group. This result is theoretically considered to be&#xD;
      because the oral diet has the advantage of increasing intestinal permeability, gut motility&#xD;
      and reducing the likelihood of pancreatic necrosis/ infection compared to the parenteral&#xD;
      diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As above, PEP has the same treatment method as general acute pancreatitis but is known to&#xD;
      have a relatively worse prognosis. However, the effect of an early diet recently attempted in&#xD;
      acute pancreatitis has not been reported in patients with PEP. Therefore, we investigate the&#xD;
      effects of early and delayed diets on the prognosis of patients with PEP through a&#xD;
      prospective multicenter study.&#xD;

      1. Selection of research subjects A total of 80 patients, who have occurred pancreatitis&#xD;
           after ERCP, will be enrolled at Yonsei University Sinchon Severance Hospital, Seoul&#xD;
           National University Hospital, Dongguk University Ilsan Hospital, Gachon University Gil&#xD;
           Hospital, Gyeongsang National University Changwon Hospital, Kyungpook National&#xD;
           University Hospital, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, Korea University Ansan Hospital, Pusan&#xD;
           National University Hospital. The purpose and contents of this clinical trial are&#xD;
           informed in detail to the subject and consent is obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluation of eligibility Eligibility is determined based on the basic patient data&#xD;
           including physical examination, vital signs, body measurements, medical history,&#xD;
           concomitant drugs, laboratory tests, and other basic examinations made at the first&#xD;
           visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Grouping and randomization After ERCP was performed, the study subjects who were judged&#xD;
           to have PEP according to enroll criteria were divided into early and delayed refeeding&#xD;
           groups using a random number table and assigned 1:1 to proceed with the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Timing of refeeding In the early refeeding group, oral diet is started 24 hours after&#xD;
           PEP is confirmed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In the delayed refeeding group, oral diet is started after confirmation of restoring of&#xD;
           normal bowel sound, pain decreasing below VAS 2. The oral diet starts with SOW (Sips of&#xD;
           water) and builds up sequentially in the order of clear liquid diet-soft diet,&#xD;
           considering patient tolerability.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Interruption of refeeding In both early and delayed refeeding groups, the oral diet is&#xD;
           stopped when the pain scale the patient complains after starting oral diet increases to&#xD;
           VAS 5 points or more, or the patient refuses to eat due to abdominal pain or other&#xD;
           reasons. The diet is restarted after the amylase/lipase level decreases below the upper&#xD;
           normal limit, the patient's pain has disappeared, and the bowel movement is restored.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Dropout criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. In the case of delayed diet group when symptoms persist for more than 96 hours and&#xD;
                cannot start a diet&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. When fasting is necessary for other reason, such as an imaging test or endoscopy&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. When it is determined that a parenteral diet is necessary for reasons such as&#xD;
                difficulty swallowing&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. When the researcher judged that the clinical trial cannot be continued&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Discharge criteria and hospitalization period for PEP If the patient is tolerable for&#xD;
           more than 24 hours after the soft diet (abdominal pain improvement, lab amylase/lipase&#xD;
           level decreases to less than 2 times the upper normal limit, it is judged that PEP has&#xD;
           improved and the discharge criteria have been satisfied. From the point of diagnosis of&#xD;
           PEP to the point of time when the discharge criteria are satisfied is defined as the&#xD;
           &quot;hospitalization period for PEP&quot;.&#xD;
