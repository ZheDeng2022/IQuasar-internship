  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adult Onset Still Disease (AOSD) is an acquired inflammatory disease of unknown etiology,&#xD;
      presenting with non specific symptoms. Its diagnosis rely on sets of criteria, i.e. Fautrel&#xD;
      Criteria and Yamaguchi Criteria. However, differential diagnosis might appear during&#xD;
      follow-up of patients. The aim of this study is to assess diagnostic performance of Fautral&#xD;
      and Yamaguchi Criteria after 18 months of follow-up, and to describe differential diagnosis&#xD;
      appearing during follow-up.&#xD;

      Adult Onset Still Disease (AOSD) is an acquired inflammatory disease of unknown etiology,&#xD;
      presenting with non specific symptoms. Other conditions such as cancer, infection or other&#xD;
      inflammatory disease might mimick its symptoms. Its diagnosis rely on sets of criteria, i.e.&#xD;
      Fautrel Criteria and Yamaguchi Criteria. However, differential diagnosis might appear during&#xD;
      follow-up after an initial diagnosis of AOSD. The aim of this study is to assess diagnostic&#xD;
      performance of Fautral and Yamaguchi Criteria after 18 months of follow-up, and to describe&#xD;
      differential diagnosis appearing during follow-up.&#xD;
