  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primitive bone sarcoma are rare tumors with low options of therapy for patient treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. OSTEOSARCOMA VERY POOR RESPONDER COHORT. Necrosis on primitive localized osteosarcoma&#xD;
           represents one of the principal prognostic factors. Nowadays, for localized osteosarcoma&#xD;
           there is no maintenance therapy that have shown to be effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In ISG-OS1 study in patients with necrosis &lt; 60% had an event free survival (EFS) at 3&#xD;
           yrs of 20% (Ferrari S ) in a more recent analysis (Tsuda Y 2020) patients with a&#xD;
           necrosis &lt;60% had a 3 y EFS of 35% .&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. OSTEOSARCOMA AND EWING'S SARCOMA AFTER FIRST RELAPSE Maintenance therapy after Complete&#xD;
           Remission occurring after Ewing's sarcoma or osteosarcoma patients is not a standard&#xD;
           rule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These patients when free from disease, after first relapse, are more likely to face a second&#xD;
      relapse. EFS at ONE YEAR after first relapse in osteosarcoma is shown in literature to be&#xD;
      around 21% (Leary SE 2013) and 16% (Tirtei E 2017). The EFS at ONE YEAR after first relapse&#xD;
      in Ewing's sarcoma is inferior to 20% (Barker 2005, Ferrari S 2015). A maintenance therapy&#xD;
      with low toxicity in these high risk patients could be an option.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metformin has been reported to a reduce the incidence of different type of cancer in diabetic&#xD;
      patients. Metformin is well tolerated in diabetics an it is used in other conditions in non&#xD;
      diabetic, as ovarian polycystic syndrome, metabolic syndrome and obesity. Metformin has been&#xD;
      employed as chemoprevention related to its mechanism of action in breast cancer (NCT01101438&#xD;
      ) and in pediatric cancer together with chemotherapy (NCT01528046).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aim to explore the effectiveness of metformin (a low cost and well tolerated drug)&#xD;
      as maintenance therapy in osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma patients at high risk of relapse.&#xD;

      MATERIALS &amp; METHODS The study is divided in two groups&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Group 1-Localized osteosarcoma that have reported a post neoadjuvant chemotherapy primary&#xD;
      tumor necrosis ≤ 60% Metformin will be administrated for 3 years maximum or until progression&#xD;
      disease or if G3 or G4 toxicity is verified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      37 patients as total population are necessary to evaluate a 3 yrs increase of EFS from 35% (&#xD;
      historical data Tsuda Y ) to 60%,&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Group 2 Osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma patients in Complete Remission after the first&#xD;
      relapse.Metformin will be administrated for 3 years or until progression .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Event Free Survival of this second group will be calculated at 1 yr with the aim of an&#xD;
      increase of EFS from 20%(historical data) to 45%&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS AND SAMPLE SIZE Sample size was calculated by the Expected Total Study&#xD;
      Length minimization criteria to ensure a potency parameter of 80 % and point if there is a&#xD;
      benefit in use Metformin compared to the historical control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EFS will be estimated by Kaplan-Meier and the standard error will be used to calculate the&#xD;
      interim analysis Z-factor as well as the final statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final statistical analysis will be performed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1 after 3 years after last patient enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2 at 1 year from the last patient enrollment : EFS at 1 year&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate the event free survival (EFS) in osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma patients with&#xD;
           high risk of relapse compared to the historical control.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate Metformin's toxicity as maintenance therapy.&#xD;

Is expected the enrolment of 30 patients as total population, in 24 months. Metformin will be administrated at the Group 2 for 1 year.
