    <textblock>
      MAEVA, which stands for Meditation, Acceptance and Commitment towards Values, is an open and&#xD;
      circular program, made up of 3 themed sessions, following a weekly rhythm. It is proposed&#xD;
      here to study this program over a period of 3 months, which will give participants the&#xD;
      opportunity to complete up to three complete cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This program is based on the practice of and the processes of acceptance and commitment&#xD;
      therapy. These approaches, used for several years, have proven their effectiveness in the&#xD;
      management of stress, chronic anxiety, insomnia, chronic pain, distress in the face of&#xD;
      chronic disease, as well as in the prevention of depressive relapses and management of&#xD;
      impulsivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unlike conventional 8-week meditation programs, the MAEva program allows patients to enter&#xD;
      the study at any stage of the disease (within, outside the exclusion criteria) and from any&#xD;
      session and to participate according to their possibilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient can participate in a weekly session of the program for 3 cycles. During the&#xD;
      sessions, it will be proposed to train meditative practices and 3 different themes will be&#xD;
      addressed (one theme per session): Meditation, Acceptance and Commitment to values.&#xD;

    <description>At the end of the first and the last cycle, as well as 3 weeks after the last cycle, the patient will be invited to answer different questionnaires evaluating his or her quality of life (HADS, QLQC30, FA12). This is why the observation period is 3 months (3 cycles of 3 weeks + 3 weeks).&#xD;
Similarly, some of the patients included in the study will be asked to complete a semi-structured interview at the end of the MAEva programme.&#xD;
Patients and nursing staff participating in the study will be asked to complete a satisfaction questionnaire</description>
