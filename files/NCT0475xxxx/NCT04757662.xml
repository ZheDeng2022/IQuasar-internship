  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Increasing preclinical and clinical data have shown that myeloid-derived suppressor cells&#xD;
      (MDSCs) may represent a significant driver of immunosuppression in glioblastoma (GBM, grade&#xD;
      IV astrocytoma) and a potential mechanism of treatment resistance to chemoradiotherapy.&#xD;
      Tadalafil, an FDA-approved drug with inexpensive cost and excellent safety profile, has been&#xD;
      shown to effectively reduce MDSCs and restore T-cell activation in the peripheral blood and&#xD;
      in the tumor microenvironment. The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of&#xD;
      targeting MDSCs in newly diagnosed IDH-wildtype grade III-IV astrocytoma by combining&#xD;
      tadalafil with standard of care radiation therapy (RT) and temozolomide (TMZ).&#xD;

    <description>Tadalafil will be given orally once daily for a total of 60 days at a weight-normalized dose as follows:&#xD;
10 mg/day if weight ≤63.5 kg&#xD;
15 mg/day if weight &gt;63.5 kg and ≤104.3 kg&#xD;
20 mg/day for weight &gt;104.3 kg&#xD;
Standard of care fractionated radiation therapy (RT) to 60 Gy in 30 daily fractions will be administered in this study.&#xD;
Concurrent temozolomide (TMZ) will be administered as per standard of care, i.e., continuously (Monday through Sunday) from Day 1 of RT to the last day of RT at a daily oral dose of 75 mg/m^2 at the discretion of treating medical oncologist.&#xD;
Adjuvant therapy will administered as per standard of care. Typically, this consists of adjuvant TMZ initiated 4 to 6 weeks after completion of RT for 6 cycles at 150-200 mg/m^2 PO per day on Days 1-5 of every 28-day cycle. Tumor-treating fields or Optune device (Novocure) as per routine clinical care during adjuvant TMZ is permitted at the discretion of the treating physician.</description>
