  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Back pain is a common complication after the use of epidural anesthesia in obstetric and&#xD;
      non-obstetric surgeries and occurs in 30-45% of cases (Brown, 2005). Certain psychological&#xD;
      problems such as depression or unhappiness due to loss of employment may prolong the episode&#xD;
      of low back pain (Miller, 2012). According to Egyptian Institution of Health Metrics and&#xD;
      Evaluation (IHME), Low Back Pain is the first cause of disability in Egypt from 2007 to 2017.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So, this study will investigate if midline approach of obstetric epidural anaesthesia will be&#xD;
      a relative risk for subacute low back mechanical functions as a new way to examine if this&#xD;
      type of anaesthesia is involved in the presence of subacute negative effects on the&#xD;
      mechanical function of low back or not (to resolve the controversy).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The lumbar (or lower back) region is made up of five vertebrae (L1-L5), sometimes including&#xD;
      the sacrum. Stability of the spine is provided by the ligaments and muscles of the back and&#xD;
      abdomen (Floyd and Thompson, 2008).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary biomechanical function of the spine is to provide structural support, to allow&#xD;
      the body to move freely, and to protect the spinal cord and nerves. Muscles balance external&#xD;
      loads to the spine, which supports the load and allows for the motion through its multilevel&#xD;
      joint arrangement (Dreischarf et al., 2016).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low back pain (LBP) is a common minor yet unpleasant complication after epidural anesthesia.&#xD;
      Different mechanisms are suggested such as needle trauma and myotoxicity of local anesthetic&#xD;
      (Louizos et al., 2005) and incidence of backache after epidural anaesthesia might be expected&#xD;
      to be higher than that after spinal anaesthesia (Brown and Elman, 1961).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In most episodes of low back pain, a specific underlying cause is not identified or even&#xD;
      looked for, with the pain believed to be due to mechanical problems such as muscle or joint&#xD;
      strain (Casazza, 2012). Most cases are idiopathic but usually attributable to muscle strain&#xD;
      or ligament injury; found in 65% to 70% of patients with mechanical chronic back pain (Cohen&#xD;
      et al., 2008) while totally mechanical low back pain is reported as the cause in about 80% to&#xD;
      95% of patients with low back pain (Cohen et al., 2008) &amp; (Dixit, 2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Caesarean section is when a baby is born through an incision in the mother's abdomen and&#xD;
      uterine wall. This requires effective anaesthesia which can be regional (epidural or spinal)&#xD;
      or a general anaesthetic. With regional epidural anaesthesia, the anaesthetic is infused into&#xD;
      the space around the mother's spinal column, whilst with regional spinal anaesthesia, the&#xD;
      drug is injected as a single dose into the mother's spinal column. With the two types of&#xD;
      regional anaesthesia, the mother is awake for the birth but numbed from the waist down while&#xD;
      with general anaesthesia, the mother is unconscious for the birth with the anaesthetic&#xD;
      affecting her whole body (Afolabi and Lesi, 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The epidural needle can be placed using the midline or paramedian approach. In both cases,&#xD;
      lidocaine 1% is infiltrated in the epidural needle insertion area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the midline approach technique, the needle is placed in the midline between 2 spine&#xD;
      processes. In the paramedian approach technique, the needle is inserted 1 cm lateral and 1 cm&#xD;
      caudal to the lower border of the upper spinous process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The epidural needle in the medline approach is advanced through ligaments: supraspinous&#xD;
      ligament, interspinous ligament, ligamentum flavum and into the target epidural space. Each&#xD;
      ligament has different density and texture, which affects the feel of the needle and the&#xD;
      resistance to insertion (Vaughan et al., 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some explanations for Low Back Dysfunction after Epidural Anaesthesia:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of back pain after epidural anesthesia is over 20% (Rose, 2012) &amp; (Saghafinia&#xD;
      et al., 2009) &amp; (Muslu et al., 2009). It occurs rarely after spinal anesthesia (Schwabe and&#xD;
      Hopf, 2001). This indicates that back pain may be associated with local trauma and nerve&#xD;
      injury caused by the epidural needle, leading to aseptic periosteitis, tendonitis,&#xD;
      ligamentous inflammation and/or osteochondritis, which result in lumbar pain (Kalso, 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Excessive elongation of spinal ligaments can cause micro-trauma of the ligament fibers&#xD;
           and tears or ruptures occur. Also, the interspinous ligaments are the first structures&#xD;
           damaged (excessive stretching) when the spine is hyperflexed (Adams et al., 1998).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Degeneration and excessive stress on the thoracolumbar fascia may also cause&#xD;
           micro-trauma, and resulting in tears. Thoracolumbar fascia may become damaged by&#xD;
           over-stretching or excessive stress, potentially eliciting pain (Bogduk, 1983).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other contributing factors include needle trauma, surgical positioning, injection of&#xD;
           saline or local anesthetic into the interspinous ligaments and development of a&#xD;
           supraspinous hematoma (Covet et al., 1967), (Crawford, 1972).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Excessive stretching of ligaments after relaxation of paraspinal muscles and localized&#xD;
           trauma to the intervertebral disc has also been implicated in causing back pain (Agarwal&#xD;
           and Kishore, 2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visual analogue scale (VAS):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The visual analogue scale is a validated, subjective measure for acute and chronic pain.&#xD;
      Scores are recorded by making a handwritten mark on a 10-cm line that represents a continuum&#xD;
      between &quot;no pain&quot; and &quot;worst pain.&quot; (Delgado et al., 2018).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pressure algometry:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pressure algometry has been described as a semi-objective method, or subjective measure and&#xD;
      Pain Pressure Threshold (PPT) is a quantitative sensory test of tissue sensitivity, and it is&#xD;
      defined as the minimal amount of pressure that produces pain, measured via a pressure&#xD;
      algometer (Ylinen, 2007).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclinometers:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An inclinometer or tilt meter is an instrument for measuring angles of slope (or tilt),&#xD;
      elevation or depression of an object or body segment with respect to gravity (Nielsen et al.,&#xD;
      2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oswestry Disability Index:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) is a valid, reliable, and responsive condition-specific&#xD;
      assessment tool that is suited for use in clinical practice. It is easy to administer and&#xD;
      score, objectifies clients' complaints, and monitors effects of therapy (Vianin, 2008).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Isokinetic dynamometry:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The isokinetic dynamometer is a gold standard instrument for measuring muscle strength and is&#xD;
      safe, valid, and reliable, based on the use of kinetic parameters that also include the&#xD;
      angular measurement of a corporeal segment throughout the range of motion (Gonosova et al.,&#xD;
      2018) &amp; (Habets et al., 2018) &amp; (Roth et al., 2017) &amp; (Guilhem et al., 2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound Elastography:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound elastography (EUS) is a recently developed ultrasound-based method, which allows&#xD;
      the qualitative visual or quantitative measurements of the mechanical properties of tissue&#xD;
      (Hall, 2003), (Garra, 2007) &amp; (Garra, 2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Myoton Pro Device:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A MyotonPRO (Myoton AS, Estonia) is a portable hand-held myotonometer that can assess muscle&#xD;
      tone and soft tissue stiffness. According to prior research, the MyotonPRO is a reliable&#xD;
      quantitative measurement for assessing the mechanical properties of muscles (Pruyn et al.,&#xD;
      2016).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MyotonPRO can differentiate the viscoelastic properties of a trigger point from a&#xD;
      non-trigger point. Our findings support the reliability of this myotonometer. This affordable&#xD;
      and portable tool can be used to objectively measure viscoelastic properties of trigger&#xD;
      points (Roch et al., 2020).&#xD;
