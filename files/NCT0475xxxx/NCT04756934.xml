  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The subsequent treatment choices for the patients with advanced melanoma, who have failed the&#xD;
      immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy of single agent. Evidences showed that PD-1 and PD-L1&#xD;
      signalling pathways are not redundant. Blocking both of them could produce synergistic&#xD;
      effect. HX008 and LP002 are humanized monoclonal antibodies targeting PD-1 on T cells and&#xD;
      PD-L1 on tumor cells respectively. In this study, participants with locally advanced or&#xD;
      metastatic melanoma who have failed previous anti-PD-1 or PD-L1 will be administrated with&#xD;
      HX008 plus LP002. The safety and preliminary efficacy will be evaluated.&#xD;
