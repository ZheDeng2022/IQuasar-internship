    <intervention_model_description>This is a prospective, single-arm pilot study evaluating preliminary efficacy and acceptability of a Noom breast cancer survivor weight loss program.&#xD;
The intervention consists of a curriculum, provided through daily articles that users are encouraged to read; logging features for weight, meals, and physical activity; in-app groups; and a virtual coach, who will communicate with participants via in-app messaging. During the first week of the study, participants will be introduced to the program, the Noom app, and their coach.&#xD;
Coaches will use a secure dashboard to monitor patient progress, which is used to increase engagement and motivation. Participants are encouraged to log their weight, physical activity, and meals daily.</intervention_model_description>
