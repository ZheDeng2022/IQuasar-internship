  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase Ib trial is to find out the best dose, possible benefits and/or side effects of&#xD;
      peposertib when given together with lutetium Lu 177 dotatate in treating patients with&#xD;
      neuroendocrine tumors. Peposertib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the&#xD;
      enzymes needed for cell formation, so as to help block the formation of growths that may&#xD;
      become cancer. Radioactive drugs, such as lutetium Lu 177 dotatate, may deliver radiation&#xD;
      directly to tumor cells and not harm normal cells. Adding peposertib to lutetium Lu 177&#xD;
      dotatate may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety and to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of lutetium Lu&#xD;
      177 dotatate in combination with M3814 (peposertib).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. II. To determine the overall response rate&#xD;
      (ORR) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 at 4, 8, and 12 months&#xD;
      post-therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To measure duration of response (DOR) associated with the combination. IV. To evaluate&#xD;
      progression-free survival (PFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      CORRELATIVE OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Measure the somatostatin receptor uptake on gallium 68 dotatate at baseline. II. Perform&#xD;
      lutetium Lu 177 dotatate dosimetry. III. Determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of&#xD;
      M3814 (peposertib). IV. Describe the tumor molecular profile using whole exome sequencing&#xD;
      (WES) and ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing (RNAseq) and correlate it with treatment outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Collect plasma for circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (ctDNA) assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Collect blood for biobanking and future correlative studies. VII. Measure association of&#xD;
      overall response rate with gallium 68 dotatate-positron emission tomography (PET)/computed&#xD;
      tomography (CT) measurements and Krenning score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of peposertib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive peposertib orally (PO) once daily (QD) or twice daily (BID) on days 1-21 and&#xD;
      lutetium Lu 177 dotatate intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every&#xD;
      56 days for up to 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 4 months for 24 months.&#xD;

             neuroendocrine tumor with positive gallium 68 dotatate scan (as determined by the site&#xD;
             principal investigator [PI]) within 6 months before enrollment. Lesions on the gallium&#xD;
             68 dotatate scan are considered positive if the maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax)&#xD;
             is &gt; 2 times the mean standard uptake value (SUVmean) of normal liver parenchyma.&#xD;
             Patients must have the gallium 68 dotatate scans available to send for central review&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients on effective anti-retroviral&#xD;
             therapy with undetectable viral load within 6 months are eligible for this trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For patients with evidence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, the HBV viral&#xD;
             load must be undetectable on suppressive therapy, if indicated&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection must have been treated&#xD;
             and cured. For patients with HCV infection who are currently on treatment, they are&#xD;
             eligible if they have an undetectable HCV viral load&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does&#xD;
             not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the&#xD;
             investigational regimen are eligible for this trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known history or current symptoms of cardiac disease, or history of&#xD;
             treatment with cardiotoxic agents, should have a clinical risk assessment of cardiac&#xD;
             function using the New York Heart Association Functional Classification. To be&#xD;
             eligible for this trial, patients should be class 2B or better&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have recovered from adverse events of previously administered&#xD;
             therapeutic agents to grade 2 or less toxicity according to Common Terminology&#xD;
             Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 5.0&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy Precaution: Men and women should avoid pregnancy for seven months after the&#xD;
             date of their last treatment with lutetium Lu 177 dotatate. It is noteworthy that&#xD;
             beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) may be secreted by a small percentage of&#xD;
             neuroendocrine tumor (NET)s, such that, in addition to being a pregnancy marker, it&#xD;
             also is a tumor marker. Consequently, NET female patients with positive beta-HCG (&gt; 5&#xD;
             mIU/mL) at baseline can be eligible to enter the study and receive treatment if&#xD;
             pregnancy can be excluded by lack of expected doubling of beta-HCG and negative pelvic&#xD;
             ultrasound. Normally, in pregnant subjects beta-HCG doubles every 2 days during the&#xD;
             first 4 weeks of pregnancy and every 3.5 days by Weeks 6 to 7. Women of childbearing&#xD;
             potential include any female who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone&#xD;
             successful surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or&#xD;
             bilateral ovariectomy) or is not postmenopausal (defined as amenorrhea &gt; 12&#xD;
             consecutive months, and for women on hormone replacement therapy, only with a&#xD;
             documented plasma follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH] level &gt; 35 mIU/mL). Even women&#xD;
             who are using oral, implanted, or injected contraceptive hormones, an intrauterine&#xD;
             device (IUD), or barrier methods (diaphragm, condoms, spermicidal) to prevent&#xD;
             pregnancy, are practicing abstinence, or where the partner is sterile (e.g.,&#xD;
             vasectomy) should be considered to be of childbearing potential. Postmenopausal women&#xD;
             who have fertilized eggs implanted are also considered to be of childbearing&#xD;
             potential. Acceptable methods of contraception may include total abstinence at the&#xD;
             discretion of the Investigator in cases where the age, career, lifestyle, or sexual&#xD;
             orientation of the patient ensures compliance. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar,&#xD;
             ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable&#xD;
             methods of contraception. Reliable contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth&#xD;
             control; abstinence) should be maintained throughout the study and for 7 months after&#xD;
             study treatment discontinuation. All women of childbearing potential and male partners&#xD;
             must use a double-barrier method of birth control or practice continuous abstinence&#xD;
             from heterosexual contact throughout the study and for seven months after the end of&#xD;
             the last treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
             Participants with impaired decision-making capacity (IDMC) who have a&#xD;
             legally-authorized representative (LAR) and/or family member available will also be&#xD;
             eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had major surgical procedures in the 4 weeks prior to enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients are excluded if they received prior systemic peptide receptor radionuclide&#xD;
             therapy (PRRT)-based therapies&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with an inability to swallow oral medications or gastrointestinal disease&#xD;
             limiting absorption of oral agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known brain metastases, unless these metastases have been treated and stabilized for&#xD;
             at least 4 weeks, prior to enrollment in the study. Patients with a history of brain&#xD;
             metastases must have either a head CT with contrast or brain magnetic resonance&#xD;
             imaging (MRI) to document stable disease prior to enrollment in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to M3814 (peposertib) or lutetium Lu 177 dotatate&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior external beam radiotherapy to more than 50% of bone marrow (whole body) will be&#xD;
             excluded, as determined by a radiation medicine physicist who will calculate the&#xD;
             volume of bone marrow exposure in prior radiotherapy portals divided by the volume of&#xD;
             total bone marrow harboring tissues. This ratio must be less than 50 percent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who cannot discontinue concomitant medications or herbal supplements that are&#xD;
             strong inhibitors or strong inducers of cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes CYP3A4/5,&#xD;
             CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. Concomitant use of CYP3A4/5 substrates with a narrow therapeutic&#xD;
             index are also excluded. Patients may confer with the study doctor to determine if&#xD;
             alternative medications can be used. The following categories of medications and&#xD;
             herbal supplements must be discontinued for at least the specified period of time&#xD;
             before the patient can be treated:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Strong inducers of CYP3A4/5, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19: &gt;= 3 weeks prior to study&#xD;
                  treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Strong inhibitors of CYP3A4/5, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19: &gt;= 1 week prior to study&#xD;
                  treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Substrates of CYP3A4/5 with a narrow therapeutic index: &gt;= 1 day prior to study&#xD;
                  treatment Patients receiving any medications or substances that are inhibitors or&#xD;
                  inducers of CYP450 enzymes are ineligible. Because the lists of these agents are&#xD;
                  constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated&#xD;
                  medical reference. As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the&#xD;
                  patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what&#xD;
                  to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a&#xD;
                  new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who cannot discontinue concomitant proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs). Patients&#xD;
             may confer with the study doctor to determine if such medications can be discontinued.&#xD;
             These must be discontinued &gt;= 5 days prior to study treatment. Patients do not need to&#xD;
             discontinue calcium carbonate&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with ongoing active infection or treatment with a live attenuated vaccine&#xD;
             within 4 weeks of dosing. In addition, a negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test&#xD;
             for Covid-19 infection is highly recommended before entering the study, and a close&#xD;
             symptom follow up within the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because M3814 (peposertib) is a DNA-PK&#xD;
             inhibitor and lutetium Lu 177 dotatate is a peptide receptor radionuclide therapy with&#xD;
             the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown&#xD;
             but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with M3814 (peposertib) and lutetium Lu 177 dotatate, breastfeeding should be&#xD;
             discontinued if the mother is treated with M3814 (peposertib) and lutetium Lu 177&#xD;
             dotatate and for 2.5 months following the last lutetium Lu 177 dotatate treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Discontinue long-acting somatostatin analogs (e.g., long-acting octreotide) for at&#xD;
             least 4 weeks prior to initiating lutetium Lu 177 dotatate. Long-acting somatostatin&#xD;
             analogs will be allowed to continue if patient has a history of carcinoid syndrome and&#xD;
             requires long-acting somatostatin analogs for control of his/her functional syndrome&#xD;
