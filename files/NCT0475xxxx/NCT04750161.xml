  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pro-inflammatory cytokines are critically important drivers of inflammatory and autoimmune&#xD;
      diseases and cytokine-targeted biologics have been transformative in the treatment of several&#xD;
      inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. As the diversity of approved cytokine-targeted biologic&#xD;
      therapies grows, it will become increasingly important to stratify patients on the basis of&#xD;
      specific genetic or disease biomarker phenotypes to ensure that patients receive the&#xD;
      appropriate cytokine-targeted biologic, at the appropriate dose, and at the appropriate time.&#xD;
      This project aims to explore patterns of pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine expression&#xD;
      within normal versus (i) psoriatic, (ii) eczematic, (iii) ichthyotic human skin, as well as&#xD;
      in human and mouse models of skin inflammation, with the objective of identifying cytokine&#xD;
      response profiles ('cytokine fingerprints') that will provide a molecular basis for (a) the&#xD;
      stratification of patients into disease subtypes that (b) enable cytokine-directed biologics&#xD;
      to be targeted towards patients that are most likely to benefit from them. The investigators&#xD;
      anticipate that 'cytokine fingerprinting' will aid in the selection of the most appropriate&#xD;
      biologics in patients that are most likely to benefit from such therapies.&#xD;

      Neutrophils, the 'first responder' cells of the immune system are recruited rapidly to sites&#xD;
      of infection or inflammation. Neutrophil granule proteases, cathepsin G, elastase and&#xD;
      proteinase-3, are thought to function as anti-microbial effectors, cooperatively working to&#xD;
      kill microorganisms during infection. However, evidence also suggests that these enzymes play&#xD;
      an important role in the coordination and escalation of inflammatory reactions, but how this&#xD;
      is achieved has remained obscure. IL-1 family cytokines are important initiators of&#xD;
      inflammation but require processing by enzymes for activation. The IL-1 cytokine family is&#xD;
      made up of 11 members, but this study will focus on the processing and activation of 7 of&#xD;
      these pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1a, IL-1b, IL-18, IL-33, IL-36a, IL-36b and IL-36g).&#xD;
      Members of the extended IL-1 family are found at high levels in barrier surfaces such as the&#xD;
      skin, and thought to play a role in conditions such as psoriasis, atopic dermatitis/eczema&#xD;
      and ichthyosis. Psoriasis particularly is associated with massive neutrophil influx. This&#xD;
      study aims to investigate the physiological relevance of neutrophil proteases in the&#xD;
      activation of IL-1 family cytokines in skin disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to study the contribution of neutrophil proteases to inflammation in&#xD;
      normal skin versus lesions from areas of skin affected by the conditions described above. The&#xD;
      investigators are interested in measuring the levels of active neutrophil proteases in normal&#xD;
      healthy skin versus skin lesions from affected sites compared to non-lesional, unaffected&#xD;
      skin. The investigators also are interested to see if levels of neutrophil proteases found in&#xD;
      lesions from affected skin sites are able to process and activate IL-1 family cytokines and&#xD;
      contribute to inflammation in this way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to include up to 80 participants; 20 healthy volunteers, 20&#xD;
      participants who will have a diagnosis of psoriasis, 20 participants who have a diagnosis of&#xD;
      atopic dermatitis and 20 patients who have a diagnosis of ichthyosis with active lesions on&#xD;
      their arms. Skin samples from normal versus lesional and non-lesional, unaffected skin will&#xD;
      be taken by tape stripping method.&#xD;
