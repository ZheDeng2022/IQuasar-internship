    <textblock>
      Otitis media (OM) is one of the most common childhood infections and is a major cause of&#xD;
      morbidity in children and results as being the first cause of antibiotic prescription among&#xD;
      children in developed countries . An artificial intelligence-based tool could help physicians&#xD;
      refine their diagnosis&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ear infections in children are very common, particularly acute otitis media (AOM) which&#xD;
      represents the first reason for visiting physicians and for antibiotic prescription in&#xD;
      children in developed countries. However, the diagnosis is not easy because of the narrowness&#xD;
      of the ear canal, the discomfort of the child during the otoscopic exam. Moreover, the&#xD;
      accuracy of the AOM diagnosis depends on the subjectivity of the physician mostly. This can&#xD;
      result in an misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment with, as a result, the emergence of&#xD;
      multi-resistant germ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine is booming and has already proven its worth in terms&#xD;
      of prevention, monitoring and diagnosis. I-Nside, an app based on Artificial Intelligence is&#xD;
      able to make automatic diagnosis of many ear pathologies, after capturing picture of any&#xD;
      eardrum using an otoendoscope fixed on a connected smartphone (SmartScope®).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators aim to assess the accuracy of AOM diagnosis the existing app, by&#xD;
      comparing the inter-rater agreement between the diagnosis made by a senior physician using a&#xD;
      traditional otoscope (considered as &quot;gold standard&quot; ) and the one made by a junior physician&#xD;
      using the app&#xD;
