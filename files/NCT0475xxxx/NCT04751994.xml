  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      2-arm, double blind, placebo controlled, randomised trial, with 50 6-week-old infants per arm&#xD;
      randomized to 98 days of daily iron (1.5mg/kg/day as ferrous sulphate) or placebo drops&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Healthy infants will be randomised to receive daily supplementation from 6-20wks of either a)&#xD;
      iron drops or b) placebo drops. Infants with significant illness or any clinical syndromes&#xD;
      that would affect interpretation will be excluded. Low birthweight infants and infants born&#xD;
      prematurely will not be excluded. Venous blood samples will be collected at enrollment (age 6&#xD;
      weeks) and after 14 weeks (98 days) of iron/placebo supplementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be visited daily in their villages by Fieldworkers (FW) to administer the&#xD;
      iron/placebo dose and will interview mothers to complete a short health questionnaire. The&#xD;
      iron will be dosed at 75% of WHO guideline dose (ie 1.5mg/kg/day). Weekly, a more detailed&#xD;
      morbidity and breastfeeding questionnaires will be administered. Infants will be weighed and&#xD;
      measured monthly, along with a faecal sample being taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the daily visits, the FWs will record any adverse events (AEs) and ensure the safety&#xD;
      of participants. If a child is found unwell or if the mother/guardian reports that the child&#xD;
      is unwell, the study nurse will check on the child and decide on treatment/referral to the&#xD;
      nearest health centre&#xD;
