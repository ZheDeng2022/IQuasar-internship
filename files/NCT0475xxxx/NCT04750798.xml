  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to prospectively collect clinical data evaluating the ongoing&#xD;
      safety and performance during routine-use standard cardiac arrhythmia mapping and/or ablation&#xD;
      procedures while using commercial Biosense Webster Inc. (BWI) medical devices. Data generated&#xD;
      from the study will be used to confirm safety and performance of BWI medical devices in the&#xD;
      marketed phase and to expand the body of evidence on the use of these devices and techniques&#xD;
      in treatment of cardiac arrhythmias.&#xD;
