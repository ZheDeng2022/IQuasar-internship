      Our aims are to investigate the acute and long term effect of ERT on exercise capacity;&#xD;
      comparing the effect of different ERT dosages (as prescribed by the clinician according to&#xD;
      clinical judgment) and assessing the relationship between enzyme blood level and exercise&#xD;
      capacity. Such evaluation may allow a more objective quantification of the response to ERT.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Pompe disease is a rare autosomal recessive metabolic myopathy caused by reduced or absence&#xD;
      activity of the lysosomal enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA). Enzyme replacement therapy&#xD;
      (ERT) with Myozyme has significantly improved the prospect of patients with infantile Pompe&#xD;
      disease (IPD). Most IPD patients show clinical improvement on therapy, but deteriorate at&#xD;
      different time points, raising the possibility that increasing drug delivery might halt the&#xD;
      progression of the disease. Data on the effects of ERT therapy on physiological variables&#xD;
      related to exercise tolerance is scarce.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our aims are to investigate the acute and long term effect of ERT on exercise capacity;&#xD;
      comparing the effect of different ERT dosages (as prescribed by the clinician according to&#xD;
      clinical judgment) and assessing the relationship between enzyme blood level and exercise&#xD;
      capacity. Such evaluation may allow a more objective quantification of the response to ERT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A retrospective - prospective study evaluating pediatric patients with Pompe before&#xD;
      and 2 days after ERT on multiple occasions and different dosing. Evaluation included&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET), 6 minute-walking test (6MWT), motor function test&#xD;
      (GMFM-88) and self-collected blood samples (on a Guthrie card) for enzyme blood levels.&#xD;
