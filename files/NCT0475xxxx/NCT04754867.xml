  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this experimental research is to increase adherence to a smoking cessation patch&#xD;
      among Pittsburgh residents who are trying to quit smoking. The literature on smoking&#xD;
      cessation shows that there is a significant problem with adherence when using a transdermal&#xD;
      patch as a nicotine replacement treatment. Less than half of patients use the patch as&#xD;
      prescribed and adherence suffers a rapid decline during the first six weeks of treatment&#xD;
      (Waldroup, Gifford, &amp; Kalra, 2006). Recent work in psychology demonstrates that being more&#xD;
      connected to our &quot;future selves&quot; enables better long-term decision making, in part by making&#xD;
      future rewards more salient (and making present rewards less so). To test whether a future&#xD;
      selves intervention might facilitate patch adherence in a smoking cessation program,&#xD;
      investigators will recruit participants planning to begin using nicotine patches in local&#xD;
      smoking cessation programs, and randomly assign them to one of three conditions: 1)&#xD;
      &quot;discontinued-smoker&quot; age-progressed future self virtual reality images vs. 2)&#xD;
      &quot;discontinued-smoker&quot; + &quot;continued smoking&quot; age-progressed future self virtual reality images&#xD;
      vs. 3) control - current self virtual reality images.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several factors are thought to be relevant to the level of adherence such as the initial&#xD;
      level of nicotine addiction (Orleans et al., 1994), gender (Gritz, Nielsen, &amp; Brooks, 1996),&#xD;
      concerns over weight gain due to smoking cessation (Fagerstr√∂m, 2002) and side effects (Burns&#xD;
      &amp; Levinson, 2008). On the other hand, combining nicotine replacement treatment with&#xD;
      behavioral therapy has been shown to improve adherence and overall abstinence (Cooper et al.,&#xD;
      2004) and motivation is found to be an important factor related to patch use (Alterman,&#xD;
      Gariti, Cook, &amp; Cnaan, 1999).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Can a more vivid connection to an individual's future self facilitate smoking cessation?&#xD;
      While behavioral interventions that enhance connection to the future self have been proven&#xD;
      effective at mitigating present bias, they have so far been done in domains that require&#xD;
      self-restraint (e.g., delinquency). Smoking cessation does in part require restraint, but a&#xD;
      cessation program utilizing the nicotine patch also requires proactive daily commitment and&#xD;
      action. Little research has been done to establish the effectiveness of a future selves&#xD;
      intervention on behaviors that require proactive action.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent work in psychology demonstrates that being more connected to our &quot;future selves&quot;&#xD;
      enables better long-term decision making, in part by making future rewards more salient (and&#xD;
      making present rewards less so). To test whether a future selves intervention might&#xD;
      facilitate patch adherence in a smoking cessation program, investigators will recruit&#xD;
      participants planning to begin using nicotine patches in local smoking cessation programs,&#xD;
      and randomly assign them to one of three conditions: 1) &quot;discontinued-smoker&quot; age-progressed&#xD;
      future self virtual reality images vs. 2) &quot;discontinued-smoker&quot; + &quot;continued smoking&quot;&#xD;
      age-progressed future self virtual reality images vs. 3) control - current self virtual&#xD;
      reality images. Participants in the &quot;discontinued smoker&quot; age-progressed virtual reality&#xD;
      condition will see two rendering of themselves in optimal health twenty years into the&#xD;
      future, a frontal and profile view; participants in the &quot;discontinued smoker&quot; + &quot;continued&#xD;
      smoking&quot; age-progressed virtual reality condition will see two frontal renderings of&#xD;
      themselves twenty years in the future, one in optimal health and one incorporating&#xD;
      appearance-related medical consequences of moderate-heavy smoking over twenty years (e.g.,&#xD;
      skin that is dry and discolored, increased wrinkles, etc.); participants in the current self&#xD;
      virtual reality condition will see their present age self in a virtual reality rendering.&#xD;
      Participants in all conditions will write a 200-300 word letter to themselves (in the&#xD;
      treatment condition, the letter is written to their self in 20 years; in control, the letter&#xD;
      is written to themselves in 3 months). The investigators will measure the impact of the&#xD;
      behavioral intervention on participants' expected efficacy with smoking cessation,&#xD;
      self-reported patch adherence, and smoking cessation success 2 and 8 weeks later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will collect self-reported and non-invasive physiological adherence data&#xD;
      over the course of 8 weeks on participants' adherence to the nicotine patch (self-report) and&#xD;
      success with smoking cessation (self-report and CO analysis). For those participants&#xD;
      self-reporting zero cigarettes smoked in the 7 day period before lab visits, investigators&#xD;
      will administer a breath CO assessment (a simple procedure where the participant breathes&#xD;
      into a tube and the device analyzes how many carbon dioxide parts per million are in the&#xD;
      breath). The investigators will also asks participants if they would be willing to receive an&#xD;
      email invitation to an online, 3-question, 6-month follow-up survey to occur four months&#xD;
      after their last in-person visit to the laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data collected will not be tied to identifiers; it will be used in statistical analyses&#xD;
      assessing the effects of the intervention.&#xD;
