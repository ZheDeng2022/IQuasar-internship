  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Very few surveys have been carried out about oncosurgical decisions made in patients with&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer (PC), and none have established whether the therapeutic approaches differ&#xD;
      between low/medium and high volume centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A survey was sent out to centers from Spanish Group of Pancreatic Surgery (GECP) asking about&#xD;
      usual pre, intra and postoperative management of PC patients and describing five imaginary&#xD;
      cases of PC corresponding to common scenarios that surgeons regularly assess in oncosurgical&#xD;
      meetings. Investigators define consensus when 80% of answers were equal.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In 2019, the Hepato-Pancreato-Biliary Surgery Section of the Spanish Association of Surgeons&#xD;
      and the Spanish Chapter of the IHPBA created the Spanish Group of Pancreatic Surgery&#xD;
      (henceforth, GECP). The GECP notified the associates of both societies about the creation of&#xD;
      the group by email, and also made announcements on their respective web pages. The GECP&#xD;
      comprises a council of eight people. On applying to join, hospitals appoint a contact person&#xD;
      who receives information on the work of the group, which is carried out on a multicenter&#xD;
      basis. Currently, 72 hospitals are part of the GECP. GECP members perform 78% of PDs&#xD;
      throughout Spain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In January 2020, a survey was sent out to the local surgeon manager of each GECP center,&#xD;
      describing decisions in pre, intra, and postoperative management of patients with PC&#xD;
      undergoing PD and five imaginary cases of patients with PC in the pancreatic head&#xD;
      corresponding to five common scenarios that surgeons regularly assess in multidisciplinary&#xD;
      oncological meetings (MDTB). It was explained in the cover letter that respondents' answers&#xD;
      should not necessarily be the ones that appear in the textbooks or clinical guidelines but&#xD;
      should reflect standard clinical practices at their centers. In the interests of objectivity,&#xD;
      it was decided that the responses should be anonymous. The questions about decisions and&#xD;
      cases were devised by the first author and sent to the seven other members of the GECP&#xD;
      organizing committee who evaluated them and finally agreed on their definitive format. The&#xD;
      cases presented were: resectable PC without vascular invasion, resectable PC with venous&#xD;
      invasion below 180ยบ, borderline PC with venous invasion above 180ยบ, PC with arterial invasion&#xD;
      below 180ยบ and severe venous invasion, and PC with liver metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators classified hospital level divided as follows (level 1: 0-250 beds or area&#xD;
      &lt;200,000 inhabitants; level 2: 251-500 beds or area &lt;400,000; level 3: &gt; 500 beds or area&gt;&#xD;
      400,000); whether liver transplantation is performed at the center (to assess whether greater&#xD;
      experience in vascular reconstruction affected intraoperative vascular management); the&#xD;
      number of hospital beds; the number of pancreaticoduodenectomies (PD), distal&#xD;
      pancreatectomies (DP) and total pancreatectomies (TP) performed at each center in 2018; and&#xD;
      data on the surgeon who completed the survey including age, gender, position and years of&#xD;
      experience in pancreatic surgery. Respondents were given a period of 60 days to submit their&#xD;
      replies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data were collected through an electronic survey using Google Forms and were analyzed&#xD;
      with the R statistical software (https://www.r-project.org/). Categorical variables were&#xD;
      expressed as number of cases and percentages. For continuous variables, normality was&#xD;
      assessed with the Shapiro-Wilk test. Variables that were normal were expressed by means and&#xD;
      standard deviation, while those that deviated from normality were expressed with medians and&#xD;
      interquartile range. As contrast tests, the chi-square test with Yates correction was used&#xD;
      for categorical variables, and the Student's t test and the Mann-Whitney U test for&#xD;
      continuous normal and non-normal variables respectively. We defined the existence of a common&#xD;
      national criterion when 80% of the respondents applied the same clinical practice.&#xD;
