  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine the effectiveness of the group psycho-education program which is&#xD;
      prepared as &quot;cognitive behavioural-based&quot;, on college students' smartphone dependency levels.&#xD;
      The research will be carried out on students studying at a private foundation University in&#xD;
      2019-2020 academic year. In this study, pre-test-final Test control group and follow-up&#xD;
      measured experimental pattern will be used to determine the effect of Psycho-education&#xD;
      program on smartphone dependency levels of college students.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Personal Information Form and Smartphone Dependency scale will be applied to students who&#xD;
      agree to participate in the study. By analysing the data results obtained from the data&#xD;
      collection tools and passing the determined limit value, 94 people will be randomly selected,&#xD;
      including 47 experiments and 47 control groups, from those who scored high on the smartphone&#xD;
      dependency scale through the SPSS program using the power analysis method. Students will be&#xD;
      informed about cognitive behavioural based psychoeducation and will be asked if they wish to&#xD;
      participate in the training. Psychoeducation Practice 1 day per week, 60-90 min. sessions&#xD;
      will take 8 weeks. At the end of the training, the final test will be applied to the&#xD;
      experimental and control group. 3rd and 6th month follow-up measurements are planned to be&#xD;
      carried out intermittently at the end of the month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the literature, it is observed that the number of intervention studies is very small, and&#xD;
      no clear conclusions have been reached. In addition, the treatment of smartphone addiction in&#xD;
      Turkey with cognitive-behavioural approach-based group psychoeducation program has not been&#xD;
      studied before. In our country, where smartphone addiction is increasing every day, the&#xD;
      importance of intervention efforts in this area is clear. It is anticipated that the&#xD;
      intervention study on addiction reduction will be supportive for researchers and will be&#xD;
      beneficial for people who need support for smartphone addiction. In this respect, it is&#xD;
      thought that it will be a guiding work for future clinical and academic studies.&#xD;

    <description>mart Phone Addiction Scale Short Form: Smartphone Addiction Scale is a 6-point Likert-type scale consisting of 10 items developed by Kwon et al. (Kwon M, et al. 2013) to determine smartphone addiction in adolescents. Its Turkish validity and reliability were made by Noyan et al. Individuals read the items and how valid the items are for them, &quot;1-I strongly disagree&quot;, &quot;2-I do not agree&quot;, &quot;3-I partially disagree&quot;, &quot;4-I partially agree&quot;, &quot;5- They make a decision by making a mark on a grading that includes &quot;I agree&quot;, &quot;6-Strongly agree&quot; Scale scores range between 10-60. The higher the score obtained from the test, the higher the risk of addiction. The scale has a single factor and does not have subscales. The cut-off score is 31 for men and 33 for women (Kim S, Kim R. A, 2002). Those who score 31 points for male participants and 33 points for female participants are divided into two groups as 'smart phone addicts', and participants below these points are 'not smart phone addicts'.</description>
