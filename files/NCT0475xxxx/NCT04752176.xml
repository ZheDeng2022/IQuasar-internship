  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tinnitus and hyperacusis are two hearing disorders that can severely impact the patient and&#xD;
      their quality of life, as they may induce sleeping disorders, concentration troubles, social&#xD;
      life disturbances. Mayfair Developments has created and developed the innovating ØREBLUE®&#xD;
      method in order to relieve, possibly completely, tinnitus and hyperacusis symptoms. The&#xD;
      ØREBLUE® method relies on a medical device, CE marked, that consists of an auditory&#xD;
      stimulation box associated with five softwares. This medical device diffuses thanks to a&#xD;
      headphone a specific and personalized sound therapy treatment for the patient. This&#xD;
      retrospective, observational study aims at collecting data about the ØREBLUE® method used in&#xD;
      routine care and describing its efficacy on tinnitus and hyperacusis.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tinnitus is a clinical symptom indicative of abnormal stimulation of the auditory system&#xD;
      characterized by the perception of chronic sound in the absence of an external sound source&#xD;
      and that only the affected subject perceives intrusively.Its presence can occur independently&#xD;
      unilaterally, bilaterally, or be described as perceived in the center of the head and can be&#xD;
      heard continuously or intermittently at varying levels of intensity and frequency. There are&#xD;
      two types of tinnitus depending on whether it can be detected with a stethoscope by the&#xD;
      doctor (objective tinnitus) or only heard by the subject (subjective tinnitus). Many&#xD;
      consequences, such as anxiety, depression and sleep disorders, linked to suffering from&#xD;
      tinnitus will impact daily life in different forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both types of tinnitus may be accompanied by a higher intolerance to noise which is called&#xD;
      hyperacusis.Hyperacusis is defined as an intolerance (and not a finer sensitivity to sounds)&#xD;
      to environmental sound levels, the intensity of which, of varying intensity, represents&#xD;
      neither risk nor inconvenience for people with normal hearing, but which induces discomfort&#xD;
      or pain in people with hyperacusis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In these clinical situations, the ØREBLUE® method is an innovative treatment with the&#xD;
      objective of eliminating the symptoms of tinnitus and hyperacusis depending on the group to&#xD;
      which the subject belongs. Its innovative character is based on the design of a sound signal&#xD;
      processing device, CE marked as medical device, developed by Mayfair Developments. This&#xD;
      technological innovation has been developed to respond specifically to the hearing profile of&#xD;
      each subject and to provide personalized rehabilitation of their hearing sphere.&#xD;

    <description>The ØREBLUE® Method combines 2 inseparable therapeutic approaches that will be personalized, one dedicated to the auditory symptom (personalized sound therapy based on music and delivered through a helmet as part of the device), the other dedicated to the psychology of the subject.&#xD;
Sound rehabilitation will be based on successive treatment sequences. The 1st sequence includes 30 hours of listening, at a rate of 2 hours / day, 5 days a week. A period of 4 to 6 weeks is necessary before carrying out a new sequence. The second sequence (and subsequent ones when necessary, respecting a 4-to-6-weeks window in between) of sound rehabilitation consists of 20 hours distributed as for the first sequence.</description>
