  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to compare the effect of different doses of energies of&#xD;
      high-intensity LASER on pain and functional activity in patients with chronic knee OA.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adding HILT to the traditional physical therapy program may reduce pain and improve the&#xD;
      functional status of the affected joints. This may provide clinicians with an understanding&#xD;
      of the different treatment modalities that may improve the quality of life of patients&#xD;
      suffering from chronic knee OA. Which may benefit a wide range of individuals affected by&#xD;
      this chronic and widespread disease all over the world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although little is known about the efficacy or mechanism of action of what has been termed&#xD;
      ''high-intensity laser therapy'' using Nd: YAG lasers it has become commercially available in&#xD;
      veterinary practice and is being marketed for the treatment of musculoskeletal disease.&#xD;
      clinical research specific to Nd: YAG high-intensity laser therapy is required, as it is&#xD;
      being used with little supporting evidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As there was no evidence about the best protocol for the treatment of knee OA as each study&#xD;
      was using different doses, different sites of application, different number of phases,&#xD;
      frequency of sessions, and the interval between sessions that make it difficult to have the&#xD;
      best results. Specifically, the dosage range in literature was ranged from 1250 to 3000 J as&#xD;
      total energy transmitted during one treatment session. The current study is an attempt to&#xD;
      answer the question of which dosage of the energy of high-intensity LASER is more effective&#xD;
      on pain and functional activities in patients with chronic knee OA at the third degree of&#xD;
      osteoarthritis as determined by (Kellgren/Lawrence grading system) as it was recommended that&#xD;
      LASER is an ideal treatment for subjects in the later stages of OA .&#xD;
