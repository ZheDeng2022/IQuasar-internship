  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and effectiveness of a nitric oxide&#xD;
      releasing solution, delivered as a footbath, to act as an antimicrobial treatment for&#xD;
      participants presenting with a diabetic foot ulcer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is hypothesized that a single, relatively short exposure (three times a week for a half&#xD;
      hour) of a nitric oxide releasing solution (NORS) for four (4) week period will be well&#xD;
      tolerated and may have other beneficial secondary outcomes for individuals presenting with&#xD;
      diabetic foot ulcers.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Non-hospitalized, ambulatory patients with controlled diabetes mellitus as determined&#xD;
             by physician diagnosis recorded in the medical record. Diabetes may be treated with&#xD;
             insulin, oral hypoglycemic agents or diet alone. Patient glycaemic control (HbA1c)&#xD;
             should be less than or equal to 12 % within 2 weeks of enrollment;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Must be â‰¥ 19 years of age unless local laws dictate otherwise;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Participants must be considered reliable, willing and able to give signed informed&#xD;
             consent, and sign the informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Participant is willing to be randomized and able to comply with the protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Participants must have either:&#xD;
&#xD;
             i) 1 or more full thickness ulcers on the foot below the malleoli with a surface area&#xD;
             exceeding 0.5 cm2 (50 mm2) after debridement (full thickness means extending through&#xD;
             the epidermis and dermis but not involving tendon, bone, or joint capsule); or ii) 1&#xD;
             or more partial thickness ulcers (i.e., do not completely penetrate the dermis) of&#xD;
             forefoot or digits; or iii) 1 or more ulcers of the forefoot or digits have&#xD;
             granulation tissue at their base.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Participants must have localized mild infection of at least 1 ulcer that would&#xD;
             ordinarily be treated on an outpatient basis. Mild infection of an ulcer is defined by&#xD;
             the presence of at least 2 manifestations of inflammation (purulence, erythema, pain,&#xD;
             tenderness, warmth, or induration) which is limited to the skin or superficial&#xD;
             subcutaneous tissues. If there is more than one ulcer meeting eligibility, the&#xD;
             Investigator will determine which ulcer will be followed for the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Mild infection defined by IDSA criteria34:&#xD;
&#xD;
             i) &quot;Local infection involving only the skin and the subcutaneous tissue (without&#xD;
             involvement of deeper tissues and without systemic signs as described below).&#xD;
&#xD;
             ii) If erythema, must be &gt;0.5 cm to â‰¤2 cm around the ulcer. Exclude other causes of an&#xD;
             inflammatory response of the skin (e.g., trauma, gout, acute Charcot&#xD;
             neuro-osteoarthropathy, fracture, thrombosis, venous stasis).&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Participants who have been previously treated or are currently under treatment for a&#xD;
             localized infection of an ulcer may be enrolled if there has been an inadequate&#xD;
             response to treatment and the ulcer is still infected as described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Participants must have a radiograph (appropriate views as determined by the&#xD;
             investigator) within the 2 weeks prior to entry showing no evidence of cortical&#xD;
             destruction consistent with osteomyelitis in the affected foot.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Participants must have either:&#xD;
&#xD;
             i) A palpable dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial pulse in the affected foot; or ii) If&#xD;
             the pulse is congenitally absent or not palpable due to edema, a Dopplerable dorsalis&#xD;
             pedis or posterior tibial pulse measured at â‰¥ 30 mm Hg; or iii) If there are no&#xD;
             palpable pulses, non Dopplerable pulses, rest pain, or claudication on walking less&#xD;
             than one block are present, the patient may be enrolled only if a vascular surgeon has&#xD;
             determined that vascular surgery, angioplasty or amputation is not warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Participants must have no more than a reduced wound area of â‰¤30% documented by the PI,&#xD;
             during the 2 weeks of screening, in which patients received institutional standard of&#xD;
             care (SOC)&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Participants may not be taking or have received any other investigational therapy or&#xD;
             approved therapy (i.e., drug or device) for investigational use within the 30 days&#xD;
             prior to entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Female Participants must be postmenopausal for at least 6 months; surgically&#xD;
             sterilized (hysterectomy or tubal ligation); or, if of child-bearing potential, must&#xD;
             have a negative pregnancy test prior to entry and must be willing to use one highly&#xD;
             effective birth control method which include: hormonal contraceptives (e.g. combined&#xD;
             oral contraceptives, patch, vaginal ring, injectables, and implants); intrauterine&#xD;
             device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS); vasectomy and tubal ligation or to use two&#xD;
             forms of effective birth control methods which include: barrier methods of&#xD;
             contraception (e.g. male condom, female condom, cervical cap, diaphragm, contraceptive&#xD;
             sponge). The Participants must have used the birth control method for at least 2&#xD;
             complete menstrual cycles prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Participants with limb threatening infection, extensive cellulitis (â‰¥2 cm beyond the&#xD;
             ulcer), lymphangitis, fasciitis, deep tissue infection, an abscess, or other evidence&#xD;
             of local complications of infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Participants with symptoms of systemic infection (e.g., severe hyperglycemia,&#xD;
             ketoacidosis, azotemia).&#xD;

             disqualification that may jeopardize patient safety or interfere with the objectives&#xD;
             of the trial (e.g., acute illness or exacerbation of chronic illness, lack of&#xD;
             motivation, history of poor compliance).&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Women who are breast feeding, pregnant or attempting to become pregnant.&#xD;
