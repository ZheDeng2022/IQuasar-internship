  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      iCALM is an online adaptation of a brief, individual, psychosocial intervention called&#xD;
      Managing Cancer and Living Meaningfully (CALM) in patients with advanced and metastatic&#xD;
      cancer. CALM has been shown to reduce or prevent depression in this population. The purpose&#xD;
      of this study is to evaluate iCALM with regards to its acceptability, feasibility and&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy in reducing or preventing psychological distress and improving&#xD;
      psychological well-being in patients with advanced cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with advanced cancer are at risk for depression due to the disease and to side&#xD;
      effects from its treatment. Depression in this population decreases quality of life and&#xD;
      adherence to treatment and increases the risk of suicide. Psychotherapy can be effective to&#xD;
      treat depression, but most patients affected by cancer and depression do not receive it, due&#xD;
      to a lack of tailored therapies or trained clinicians in cancer treatment centres or in the&#xD;
      community. To address this issue, we developed a novel 3-6 session psychotherapy intervention&#xD;
      called Managing Cancer and Living Meaningfully (CALM) to prevent and treat depression in&#xD;
      patients with advanced disease. In a large randomized controlled trial (RCT), we demonstrated&#xD;
      that CALM reduces or prevents depression in these patients. However, since access to trained&#xD;
      clinicians is limited, we will develop an online version of CALM, referred to as iCALM, and&#xD;
      test its feasibility and preliminary efficacy. In the present study we will: i) adapt the&#xD;
      CALM intervention to its online delivery; and ii) recruit 50 patients at the Princess&#xD;
      Margaret Cancer Centre (PM), who will be randomized (25 patients per group) to receive either&#xD;
      iCALM or usual care. Usual care patients will be offered iCALM at the end of the study on&#xD;
      compassionate grounds. Questionnaires assessing intervention satisfaction, depression, death&#xD;
      anxiety, and quality of life will be administered at recruitment and after 4, 8 and 12 weeks.&#xD;
      Qualitative interviews will be conducted with patients and eCoaches to explore their&#xD;
      experience of using iCALM.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A reliable and valid 9-item measure for depression. Total PHQ-9 scores may range from 0-27, with higher scores indicating more severe depressive symptoms. This measure will be administered to all participants at baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks and 12 weeks to assess change over time.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life at the End of Life-Cancer Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A 14-item modified measure of the QUAL-E designed to assess the quality of life in patient populations nearing the end of life. Total scores may range from 0-70 with higher scores indicating better outcomes. This measure will be administered to all participants at baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks and 12 weeks to assess change over time.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Death and Dying Distress Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A validated 15-item scale measuring death anxiety in advanced cancer patients. Total DADDS scores may range from 0 to 75, with higher scores indicating greater death anxiety. This measure will be administered to all participants at baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks and 12 weeks to assess change over time.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A reliable and valid 16-item version of the ECR-M-36 that assesses general attachment orientations to close others. It provides sub-scale scores assessing for attachment anxiety (i.e., fear of abandonment) and avoidance (i.e., defensive independence).Total scores on each dimension may range from 0-56 with higher scores indicating poor attachment insecurity. This measure will be administered to all participants at baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks and 12 weeks to assess change over time.</description>

Scores on each dimension may range from 0-20, and total scores may range from 0-80 with higher scores indicating greater acceptance towards POIs.This measure will be administered to participants randomized to the iCALM intervention at 4 weeks, 8 weeks and 12 weeks to assess change over time.</description>
