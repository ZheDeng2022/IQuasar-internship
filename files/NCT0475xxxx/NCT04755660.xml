  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare motivational interviews and self-efficacy&#xD;
      theory-based exercise behavior and home-based resistance exercise (elastic band to&#xD;
      non-elastic band) to improve physical activity, muscle strength, body composition, and&#xD;
      self-efficacy of exercise in type 2 diabetic patients. The effectiveness of performance and&#xD;
      exercise compliance.&#xD;

      This study adopts an experimental research design. A total of 90 cases of type 2 diabetes who&#xD;
      are not exercising regularly are recruited from the outpatient clinic of the Metabolism&#xD;
      Department of a medical center in the north to participate in the study. Blocks 6, and 12&#xD;
      (Block) are randomly assigned. The research subjects were assigned to the behavior change and&#xD;
      resistance exercise group, and home-based resistance exercise( with elastic band), and the&#xD;
      control group. The behavior changes and resistance exercise group received motivational&#xD;
      interviews and self-efficacy theory-based exercise behavior changes and resistance exercise&#xD;
      guidance intervention, home resistance exercise. the group received home elastic band&#xD;
      resistance exercise training, and the control group received regular exercise guidance. The&#xD;
      three groups received data collection of physical activity, muscle strength, body&#xD;
      composition, physical activity function, and exercise self-efficacy in the pre-test, the&#xD;
      sixth week, and the twelfth week. During the study period, the exercise log was used to&#xD;
      collect the mediating variable about exercise compliance (Time × frequency) data collection.&#xD;
      This study compares the effectiveness of motivational interviews and self-efficacy&#xD;
      theory-based exercise behavior intervention and home resistance exercise training programs.&#xD;
      The result will show an empirical evidence for type 2 diabetic patients to increase physical&#xD;
      activity and muscle strength in the future, and will also apply to training of muscle&#xD;
      strengthening in diabetes and other chronic disease.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Physical activity measured leisure-time physical activity for 7 days by Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE).PASE was self-administered occupational, household, and leisure physical activities. Participants were asked about the intensity, frequency, and duration of a variety of activities, including walking; strenuous, moderate, and light sports; muscle strength and endurance; occupational activities that included standing or walking; lawn work and gardening; caring for another person; home repairs; and heavy and light housework over the previous 7 days. The frequency and duration of each activity were multiplied by an empirically derived item weight and summed to compute the total PASE score activity.15 The PASE questions work-related, household, and leisure time activities for the 7 days preceding the interview. The score is continuous, ranges from 0 to 793, and higher values indicate a more active individual.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Muscle strength</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Hand Grip strength bilateral Grip strength will be measured using a Jamar dynamometer by asking the patient to squeeze the dynamometer handle with each hand third alternately, starting with the right hand using a standardized protocol. A brief break of approximately 1 min will be allowed between each measurement, and the maximum value will be recorded in kilograms (kg). The relative test-retest reliability of grip-strength measures obtained by dynamometry was good to excellent (intra-class correlation coefficients &gt; 0.80) (Bohannon,2017).ICC of the test-retest with one single operator ranged from 0·60 (0·37-0·83) for the ankle extensors to 0·85 (0·74-0·95) for the elbow flexors.</description>

    <measure>Body composition</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>In this study, body composition was measured by OMROM HBF-701 for body weight and body fat machine were used to measure the body weight, body fat, and limb skeletal muscle ratio of the participants. Using single frequency 4 poles (using 50 kHz single 1 frequency, measured by 4 guide poles-hands and feet), the skeletal muscle rate of the whole body, arms, trunk, and feet was measured, The value range is 5.0~50.0%, with 0.1% as the unit.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>self-efficacy about exercise will measured by Chinese version of the self-efficacy for exercise (SEE-C) scale . It was designed to test people's confidence to continue exercising in the face of barriers to exercise.The participants will instruct to listen to the statement and then choose an option from 0 (not confident) to 10 (very confident). The scale was scored by summing the numerical ratings for each response and dividing the total by the number of non-missing responses. The mean scores for the self-efficacy of exercise ranged from 0 to 10, with the higher scores representing greater exercise self-efficacy.SEE-C has acceptable levels of reliability and validity for the scale when used with older people in Taiwan.</description>

    <measure>Physical Performance</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Physical performance was 30-s chair stand test,6-meter walking speed&#xD;
6-meter walking speed: Participants walked twice at their usual pace over a 6-meter course. Time in seconds was recorded between the 2nd and the 4th meter. Distance (m) divided by time (s) was used to calculate walking speed. Slow gait speed was defined using AWGS 2019 reference value of &lt; 1.0 m/s&#xD;
30-s chair stand test: Participants were instructed to rise as quickly as possible from a seated position, with full body weight on the chair, to a standing posture, with their legs fully extended, while keeping their arms folded across their chest. The 30CST measures the maximal number of chair stands completed during 30 s of the test.</description>
