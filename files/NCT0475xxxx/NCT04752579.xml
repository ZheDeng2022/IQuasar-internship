  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The technique of Pilates exercises on a mat has proven to be effective and practically&#xD;
      applicable to patients with chronic back pain. However, its application in women over 65&#xD;
      years has not been adequately studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: This assessor-blind randomized clinical trial aims to study the effect of a mat&#xD;
      Pilates exercise program on pain and functional ability of elderly women with chronic&#xD;
      nonspecific low back pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: 60 elderly women with chronic nonspecific low back pain (duration of symptoms more&#xD;
      than 12 weeks) are expected to participate in this study. Participants will be divided into&#xD;
      two groups of 30 people each; one being intervention and one control. The intervention group&#xD;
      will follow a custom mat Pilates program (twice per week) for 10 weeks, while the control&#xD;
      group will not follow any treatment. Pain, functionality, balance, the number of painkillers&#xD;
      administered, and adherence to exercise will be assessed at the beginning and end of the&#xD;
      study and will be re-examined three months later.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Methods: 60 non-active elderly women with chronic nonspecific low back pain (duration of&#xD;
      symptoms more than 12 weeks) are expected to participate in this study. Participants will be&#xD;
      divided into two groups of 30 people each; one being intervention and one control. The&#xD;

      visual analog scale for pain and functionality with the Roland-Morris Questionnaire (RMQ).&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes will include the balance with the Berg balance scale and the Timed Up and&#xD;
      Go test, the number of painkillers administered, and the adherence to the exercise that will&#xD;
      be evaluated at the beginning and at the end of the study and re-evaluated three months after&#xD;
      the end of the intervention. The treatment period will be 10 weeks.&#xD;

    <measure>Changes in Low back pain intensity with the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-treatment, Week: 10, 24</time_frame>
    <description>VAS is a card with an uncalibrated scale ranging from 0-100mm on the one side with each millimeter representing one pain level (0 representing no pain and 100 representing the worst pain in life). The patient subjectively estimated their pain level by marking a vertical line on the uncalibrated scale between 0 and 100.&#xD;
Then the exact value of pain intensity could be obtained with a single ruler. Hence, the higher the value, the more intense the pain. VAS is widely used as it is easy to implement and is characterized by good psychometric propert</description>

    <measure>Changes in Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-treatment, Week: 10, 24</time_frame>
    <description>Disability associated with low back pain in the last 24 hours will be assessed using the Greek version of the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (Boscainos et al., 2003). This questionnaire has showed good test -retest reliability with intraclass correlation (ICC) ranging from 0.42 to 0.91 (Macedo et al., 2010), while Boscainos (2003), reports that the internal consistency reliability for the Greek version reached a Cronbach's alpha coefÔ¨Åcient of 0.885. This questionnaire consists of 24 items that are related to daily activities which patients often report difficulty performing due to low back pain. Every positive answer earns a point and the final score is calculated by adding all the points. Thus, the higher the score is, the greater the limitation (Stratford, 1996).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Timed Up and Go (TUG) Test</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-treatment, Week: 10, 24</time_frame>
    <description>The TUG test is a performance-based measure of functional mobility that was initially developed to identify mobility and dynamic balance impairments in older adults (Cameron and Monroe, 2007; Swearingen and Brach, 2001; Podsiadlo and Richardson, 1991). The TUG test has demonstrated high interrater and intrarater reliability when used to examine elderly adults (Cameron and Monroe, 2007; Swearingen and Brach, 2001). The test requires the subject to rise from a chair, walk three meters at a comfortable pace to a mark placed on the floor, turn around, walk back to the starting point, and return to sitting on the chair. The test's score is the time it takes the subject to complete the test.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Berg Balance Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-treatment, Week: 10, 24</time_frame>
    <description>The Berg balance scale is a tool suggested by Berg (Berg et al., 1989; Berg et al., 1992) to evaluate balance in the elderly. The test involves performing 14 tests of gradually increasing difficulty where in each one, the subject is asked to maintain a given position for a specific time or conduct specific tasks. Each of the 14 tests on the list is graded according to the balancing ability of the examinee from 0 to 4 points (with 0 indicating low balance ability while 4 high). Accord to Berg et al. (1992), a score of 56 indicates functional balance whereas a score lower than 45 indicates notable balance deficits, which have been related to increased fall risk.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in the number of pills consumed via Pill Consumption Log</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-treatment, Month: 1,2,3, post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked to write down in a special diary the number of pills administered (anti-inflammatory and/or painkillers) during the follow-up period. The log will be kept kept on a weekly basis and the assessor will collect the data by phone 2-3 times a month.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in adherence to exercise via Exercise Diary keeping</measure>
    <time_frame>Time Frame: pre-treatment, Month: 1,2,3, post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>After the ten weeks the participants of both groups will be asked to perform the specific exercise programs twice per week for a period of three months recording the adherence or not to the exercise programs in a weekly diary while the assessor will collect the data by phone 2-3 times a month.</description>
