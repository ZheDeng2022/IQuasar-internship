  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) are potentially harmful events occurring during&#xD;
      childhood that have been associated with chronic physical conditions in adulthood, including&#xD;
      coronary artery disease (CAD). ACEs may constitute a portion of the remaining unexplained&#xD;
      residual risk for CAD in adults. Identifying a means of addressing these experiences may&#xD;
      mitigate their health consequences and result in improved cardiovascular outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to determine if patients who undergo ACE screening&#xD;
      experience improved quality of life compared to patients who undergo conventional lifestyle&#xD;
      assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a single-centre, pragmatic, single-blinded (i.e. data analysts), 1:1, pilot&#xD;
      randomized control trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ACEs encapsulate a broad spectrum of traumatic and distressing events occurring before the&#xD;
      age of 18 that span the domains of abuse, household dysfunction, neglect, amongst others, and&#xD;
      that threaten a child's physical, familial or social safety. The landmark ACE Study,&#xD;
      published by Felitti and colleagues, was the first study to propose the association between&#xD;
      ACEs and the development of chronic physical conditions in adulthood, including&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease (CVD). Due to a variety of mechanisms, exposure to an ACE increases&#xD;
      predisposition to the development of CVD and its conventional risk factors. ACEs nonetheless&#xD;
      remain underrecognized and undermanaged in routine cardiovascular clinical encounters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Integration of ACE screening into the standardized clinical assessment of CVD may enable&#xD;
      cardiologists to better identify patients who might benefit from further post-ACE resiliency&#xD;
      interventions and serve as an impactful secondary and tertiary prevention strategy. The ACE&#xD;
      screening process itself may be therapeutic as it gives patients the opportunity to discuss&#xD;
      their early experiences, reflect on the role of early adversity in their current health&#xD;
      problems, and have some sympathetic acknowledgement about this history from a health care&#xD;
      professional. This has been termed &quot;ACE insight&quot;. Screening for ACEs has been found to be&#xD;
      acceptable by patients. Patients may have never had any opportunity to discuss ACEs they have&#xD;
      undergone throughout their entire life, enabling their effects to propagate into adulthood.&#xD;
      Inquiring about ACE exposure during clinical encounters with all patients may garner insights&#xD;
      that can have a beneficial effect in improving cardiovascular health. Additionally, engaging&#xD;
      patients in stress-coping therapies, such as mindfulness, and referral for psychological&#xD;
      consultation as needed, may also be helpful. Although logical, these strategies still lack&#xD;
      adequate evidence and a randomized trial is needed to evaluate their potential in reducing&#xD;
      the occurrence of cardiovascular events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to assess whether deleterious childhood exposures are associated with an&#xD;
      increased prevalence of risk factors for CAD and represent an independent risk factor for&#xD;
      CAD. Furthermore, screening for ACEs in patients with CAD may serve as a therapeutic&#xD;
      intervention in itself by providing both ACE insight and a platform to unload internal&#xD;
      psychological burdens. Screening may result in an enhanced quality of life, as well as&#xD;
      improved health behaviours that may benefit their cardiovascular outcomes.&#xD;
