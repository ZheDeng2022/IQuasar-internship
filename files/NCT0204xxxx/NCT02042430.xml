      This pilot Early Phase I clinical trial studies epacadostat before surgery in treating&#xD;
      patients with newly diagnosed stage III-IV epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary&#xD;
      peritoneal cancer. Epacadostat may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the&#xD;
      enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the extent by which INCB024360 (epacadostat) alters the number of cluster of&#xD;
      differentiation (CD)8+ T cells by immunohistochemistry (IHC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the extent by which INCB024360 alters the number and character of tumor&#xD;
      infiltrating lymphocytes by IHC and gene signature by microarray analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the extent to which INCB024360 alters the character of the cellular content&#xD;
      of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and ascites fluid as determined by&#xD;
      multiparameter flow cytometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the extent to which INCB024360 alters PBMC and ascites fluid&#xD;
      transcriptomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine whether INCB024360 alters the ongoing and nascent anti-tumor responses&#xD;
      antigens associated with ovarian cancer (e.g., cancer/testis antigen 1B [NY-ESO-1],&#xD;
      preferentially expressed antigen in melanoma [PRAME] and mesothelin) as well as memory viral&#xD;
      responses (influenza A), and chronic viral responses (cytomegalovirus).&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To assess the safety and tolerability of INCB024360. VI. To determine the extent to which&#xD;
      a regimen of INCB024360 that normalizes serum kynurenine/tryptophan (Kyn/Trp) ratios will&#xD;
      alter the tumor microenvironment by assessing the ascites and intra-tumor Kyn/Trp ratios at&#xD;
      the time of surgery, one day after stopping INCB024360.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To associate any observed changes with the expression of IDO1 protein by IHC in tumor or&#xD;
      tumor infiltrating cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive epacadostat orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-14 and undergo surgery&#xD;
      on day 15. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity. In circumstances where there are medical or administrative reasons for delaying&#xD;
      surgery, treatment with epacadostat may continue for up to 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 1 year.&#xD;
