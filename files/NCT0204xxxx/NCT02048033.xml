    <textblock>
      Nowadays morbid obesity (BMI ≥ 40kg/m²) is a major problem of public health in industrialized&#xD;
      countries. About 500 000 patients would be affected by this disease in France in 2009.&#xD;
      Prevalence of the morbid obesity raised from 0.3 % (± 0.1 %) of the population in 1997 to 1.1&#xD;
      % (± 0.1 %) in 2009 (Extrapolation of the data ObEpi on 2009 to the French population) (1).&#xD;
      For this type of patient, the only long-term effective treatment recognized by the scientists&#xD;
      is the bariatric surgery. (2-4) Roux and Y Gastric Bypass (GBP) is a consensual procedure,&#xD;
      that has been described in the sixties, in this indication (approximately 11000 GBP performed&#xD;
      in FRance in 2012 (5,6). This operation consists on the creation of a proximal gastric pouch&#xD;
      (50 cc). A Roux and Y intestinal loop will be added to create a malabsorptive part. 60 to 80&#xD;
      % of excess weight loss described in the literature in the long-terms. Furthermore,&#xD;
      improvement or remission of T2DM, sleep apnea syndrome, arterial hyperpressure, dyslipidemia)&#xD;
      are emphasized in many trials (5, 7). However 15 to 20 % of the handled patients present a&#xD;
      weight regain 5 years post surgery potentially explained by the dilation of the gastric pouch&#xD;
      or the gastro jejunal anastomosis and thus a decrease of the restrictive effect. (8-11) To&#xD;
      palliate this complication two solutions are described. (12-15; 19) The first one consists in&#xD;
      a recalibration of the gastric poouch by surgical approachy. In this case, a ring of silicone&#xD;
      or polypropylene can be positioned around the gastric pocket. Other possible solution is to&#xD;
      redo a new gastrojejunostomy with a smaller size, by surgical access (laparotomy or&#xD;
      laparoscopy). These interventions are very delicate because of important peritoneal adhesions&#xD;
      and present a rate of significant morbidity especially if they are performed under&#xD;
      laparotomy. The pure medical care does not allow long-term results stable. ²² A therapeutic&#xD;
      dead end is reported often for this type of patient. A new possibility was recently&#xD;
      described. (17-18) A recalibration can be realized by sutures performed under endoscopic&#xD;
      approach at the level of the gastro jejunal anastomosis or from the gastric pouch by the&#xD;
      APOLLO Endosurgery OverStitch. The digestive surgery by endoscopic way is rapidly expanding.&#xD;
      The first results seem to be promising (resumed the weight loss) but owe to be estimated in a&#xD;
      randomized study comparing this new process with the medical conventional treatment. A&#xD;
      single-blind, randomized, forward-looking study, multicenter, comparative between two&#xD;
      parallel groups of patients presenting a weight regain after GBP was thus organized. The main&#xD;
      objective is to estimate the efficiency of the APOLLO Endosurgery OverStitch technique versus&#xD;
      the non-interventional strategy. The secondary endpoints is to study the morbidity of the&#xD;
      procedure, the evolution of quality of life of the patients, the medical economic impact of&#xD;
      the innovation in 24 months.&#xD;

    Following the occurrence of four serious adverse events in the APOLLO group and after&#xD;
    discussion with the investigator, we consider that this minimally invasive protocol causes an&#xD;
    increased risk of morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
