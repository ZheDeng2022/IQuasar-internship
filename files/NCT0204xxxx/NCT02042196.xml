    <textblock>
      As women get older and go through menopause, levels of the female reproductive hormone&#xD;
      estradiol decrease to low levels. Also with aging, the functioning of the arteries declines.&#xD;
      Over time this vascular dysfunction can lead to health problems such as high blood pressure&#xD;
      and heart disease. This study is being done to help determine what causes arteries to become&#xD;
      unhealthy in postmenopausal women, who have low levels of the female reproductive hormone&#xD;
      estradiol. In this study we will test whether low levels of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), a&#xD;
      natural substance in the body that can cause the arteries to expand, explains why arteries&#xD;
      become unhealthy in women with low levels of estradiol. To answer this question, we will&#xD;
      study how vascular function changes with a medication that causes a short-term increase in&#xD;
      BH4 levels when estradiol is lowered with a medication, compared to when estradiol is normal.&#xD;
      We will also determine whether the administration of the antioxidant vitamin C, along with&#xD;
      the medication to increase BH4 levels, will normalize vascular health in perimenopausal and&#xD;
      postmenopausal women, and in women who have their estradiol levels lowered.&#xD;

      Endothelial dysfunction, featuring reduced vascular endothelial-dependent dilation (EDD), is&#xD;
      a significant predictor of cardiovascular (CV) events. Reduced EDD is characterized by the&#xD;
      loss of nitric oxide (NO) production. EDD declines with aging in women at a slower rate&#xD;
      compared to men but rapidly declines after menopause and quickly catches up to men,&#xD;
      suggesting a beneficial effect of estrogen (E2). Our research has investigated the mechanisms&#xD;
      underlying endothelial protection of E2 including how hormonal fluctuations during the&#xD;
      peri-to early postmenopausal years contribute to endothelial dysfunction, and how these&#xD;
      hormonal changes might interact with aging. Using a well described experimental model&#xD;
      (systemic infusion of ascorbic acid; AA) to acutely reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS), our&#xD;
      preliminary findings implicate oxidative stress as an underlying mechanism explaining the&#xD;
      impaired EDD during the menopausal transition. Specifically we found improved EDD in response&#xD;
      to AA in late peri- and postmenopausal women but not in pre- or early perimenopausal women.&#xD;
      These data indicate that E2 may protect the vasculature from free radical injury during pre-&#xD;
      and early perimenopausal years. In support of this concept, we demonstrated that AA can&#xD;
      reverse the decrease in EDD that occurs in the setting of short-term E2 deficiency (3-days of&#xD;
      gonadotropin releasing hormone antagonist; GnRHant) in pre-and early perimenopausal women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is a critical co-factor in the production of NO by endothelial&#xD;
      nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), and in the face of deficient levels, uncoupling of eNOS results&#xD;
      in the production of ROS instead of NO. Whether the increased ROS and impaired EDD that&#xD;
      occurs during the peri- and early postmenopausal periods is associated with reduced vascular&#xD;
      BH4 is at present unknown. However, our finding that AA could not improve the reduced EDD&#xD;
      found in early perimenopausal women or restore EDD in peri-and postmenopausal women to&#xD;
      premenopausal levels, indicates that other sources of ROS or causes of low NO are involved in&#xD;
      the impaired EDD across the stages of the menopause transition and aging in women. In vitro&#xD;
      studies demonstrate that the co-administration of BH4 and AA completely prevents the eNOS&#xD;
      uncoupling and decreased NO production in endothelial cells treated with a peroxynitrite&#xD;
      (ONOO-) donor, compared to administering either one alone. The global aim of this renewal is&#xD;
      to follow-up on our previous findings and to determine the role of BH4 as a mediator of&#xD;
      endothelial dysfunction [across the stages of the menopausal transition and aging in women.&#xD;
      This global aim will be addressed by 3 specific aims (SA). Using a cross-sectional design,&#xD;
      SA1 will measure EDD in healthy pre-, peri- and postmenopausal women: 1) under basal&#xD;
      conditions; and 2) following an acute increase in BH4. SA2 will expand on the cross-sectional&#xD;
      comparisons via short-term (10 days) ovarian suppression (GnRhant) in pre-and early&#xD;
      perimenopausal women to isolate the age-independent effects of E2. SA3 will examine whether&#xD;
      co-administration of BH4 and AA fully restore youthful EDD in peri-and postmenopausal women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SA1: To determine the possible mechanistic involvement of BH4 deficiency in the decline in&#xD;
      endothelial function during the peri-and early postmenopausal period and its potential&#xD;
      relation to oxidative stress. This will be assessed by comparing brachial artery EDD and&#xD;
      plasma and endothelial cell markers of oxidative stress and NO (see methods for details) in&#xD;
      healthy pre-, peri-and postmenopausal women: 1) under basal conditions; and 2) in response to&#xD;
      acute oral BH4 (vs PL) supplementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis1 (H1): a) EDD will increase in response to BH4 in early peri, late peri and&#xD;
      postmenopausal women but not premenopausal women. b) The increase in EDD in response to BH4&#xD;
      will be associated with a decrease in plasma markers of oxidative stress. c) The reduced EDD&#xD;
      in peri- and postmenopausal women will be associated with lower endothelial cell markers of&#xD;
      NO and higher oxidative Stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SA2: To determine whether the decrease in EDD in response to acute ovarian suppression in&#xD;
      pre- and early perimenopausal women is related to reduced BH4 bioavailability and elevated&#xD;
      markers of oxidative stress. This will be assessed by comparing EDD and plasma markers of&#xD;
      oxidative stress after acute oral supplementation of BH4 (or PL) following either acute&#xD;
      ovarian suppression with (GnRHant+E2) or without (GnRHant+PL) E2 add-back. Additionally,&#xD;
      endothelial cell protein expression of markers of BH4 biosynthesis and oxidative stress will&#xD;
      be measured before and after the suppression/add-back paradigm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H2: a) The expected decrease in EDD and increase in plasma oxidative stress markers following&#xD;
      acute ovarian suppression will be mitigated in the groups treated with oral BH4&#xD;
      (GnRHant+PL+BH4); there will be little or no effect of the addition of BH4 to the E2 add-back&#xD;
      group. b) Ovarian suppression alone will reduce endothelial protein markers of BH4&#xD;
      biosynthesis and will increase markers of oxidative stress. These changes will not be&#xD;
      observed following ovarian suppression with E2 add-back and oral BH4. These sets of&#xD;
      experiments will provide evidence that the oxidative stress-related decrease in EDD in&#xD;
      response to E2 suppression is in part, related to decreased BH4 bioavailability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SA3: To determine whether the co-administration of BH4 with AA will completely restore EDD in&#xD;
      peri-and postmenopausal women, and in early perimenopausal women following ovarian&#xD;
      suppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H3: The co-administration of BH4 with AA will restore EDD to premenopausal levels a) in&#xD;
      peri-and postmenopausal women, and b) in early perimenopausal following acute ovarian&#xD;
      suppression.&#xD;
