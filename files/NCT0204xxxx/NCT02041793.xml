      This study will be conducted in the Department of Surgical Disciplines and Department of&#xD;
      Gastroenterology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi. Patients with&#xD;
      pancreatic pseudocyst will be randomized to two groups-&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group I- Laparoscopic management of the pseudocyst Group II- Endoscopic management of the&#xD;
      pseudocyst&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized using computer generated randomized numbers in sealed envelopes&#xD;
      to ensure concealed allocation with block randomization. The details of patients who do not&#xD;
      meet inclusion criteria and those who refuse consent and reason for refusal of consent will&#xD;
      also be noted. Refusal for consent for inclusion in the study will not hamper the treatment&#xD;
      of these patients in anyway. The patients will be evaluated prospectively. CONSORT guidelines&#xD;
      will be followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative Data&#xD;
&#xD;
      The details regarding demographic profile of the patient i.e. age/ sex/ body mass index (BMI)&#xD;
      and clinical features will be noted. The duration and presenting complaint for pseudocyst and&#xD;
      history regarding the acuteness of underlying pancreatic disease will be noted. The etiology&#xD;
      of pancreatitis will be noted. Patients will be examined thoroughly and the characteristic&#xD;
      features of the pseudocysts, the size and the site (head, body or tail of the pancreas) will&#xD;
      be noted. The American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grading of the patient will also be&#xD;
      done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-operative Investigations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative investigations will include hemogram, liver function tests, serum electrolytes,&#xD;
      serum amylase, serum lipase, kidney function tests, chest X-ray and electrocardiogram.&#xD;
      Ultrasound of the abdomen, and contrast enhanced computer tomography (CECT) will be done for&#xD;
      proper localization, size, wall characteristics, presence or absence of pseudoaneurysm and&#xD;
      relationship of the cyst with the surrounding structures. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)&#xD;
      will be done to asses the relative amount of necrotic debris within the cyst, if required. An&#xD;
      Endoscopic ultrasound will be done at the discretion of the gastroenterologist for planning&#xD;
      endoscopic drainage of the pseudocyst.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A clinical case record (CRF) form will be filled with all the relevant details.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTION TECHNIQUE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laparoscopic Cystogastrostomy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-operative Preparation&#xD;
&#xD;
      One dose of injection cefoperazone 1000 mg + sulbactam 1000 mg after skin test, one dose of&#xD;
      metronidazole 500 mg and Amikacin 1000 mg will be given intravenously as prophylaxis&#xD;
      pre-operatively at the time of induction of anesthesia. The antibiotics will be continued for&#xD;
      3 days after surgery. A 14 Fr Foley's catheter will be placed pre-operatively after induction&#xD;
      of anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operative Procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient will be placed in Lloyd-Davis position with both upper limbs by side of the patient.&#xD;
      General anesthesia with or without supplementation with spinal anesthesia will be given to&#xD;
      all patients. A 12 mm camera port at umbilicus, one 5 mm port in the left pararectal region,&#xD;
      one 12 mm port in the right pararectal area at the level of umbilicus and the fourth port in&#xD;
      the epigastric region for puncturing and aspirating the pseudocyst. 2-3 ml of 0.25%&#xD;
      bupivacaine will be infiltrated at each port site for local anesthesia before port placement.&#xD;
      Pneumoperitoneum will be created using veress needle. The first port will be inserted in a&#xD;
      closed manner and directed towards the upper abdomen. The bulge of the pseudocyst on the&#xD;
      posterior wall of the stomach will be identified and access to the posterior gastric wall&#xD;
      will be established through an anterior gastrotomy (2 -2.5 cm) created with the help of&#xD;
      harmonic shears/monopolar hook knife. A long needle will be introduced to confirm the&#xD;
      location of the pseudocyst and to sample the fluid. A bariatric port will be introduced&#xD;
      through the posterior wall of the stomach into the cyst and its contents aspirated. The cyst&#xD;
      will then be irrigated through the port and debris cleared. The cystogastrostomy stoma will&#xD;
      be made with endostapler (Ethicon Endo-surgery, Cincinnati). Gastrotomy will be closed in two&#xD;
      layers with intracorporeal suturing. Cholecystectomy will be done if necessary using the&#xD;
      standard four port technique. A 16 F drain will be placed in the subhepatic space.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Details of any associated procedures like cholecystectomy, laparoscopic CBD exploration or&#xD;
      any other procedure will be recorded and details noted thereof.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endoscopic Cystogastrostomy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preprocedural preparation&#xD;
&#xD;
      One dose of injection cefoperazone 1000 mg + sulbactam 1000 mg after skin test will be given&#xD;
      intravenously as prophylaxis before the procedure and will be continued for up to 3 days&#xD;
      after the procedure or as required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ideal site of puncture will be determined by the site of maximum bulge on the posterior&#xD;
      gastric wall. A needle knife will be used to puncture into the gastric or cyst wall with the&#xD;
      help of electrocoagulation. A gush of cyst fluid will be encountered when the cyst is&#xD;
      entered. A guide wire will be then passed through the needle knife. A balloon will be used to&#xD;
      dilate the opening up to 15 mm without cutting. One 10 Fr plastic double pigtail stent will&#xD;
      be placed into the pseudocyst. The stent will be removed three months later. If there is no&#xD;
      bulge on endoscopic view, cystogastrostomy will be done under endoscopic ultrasonography&#xD;
      guidance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the presence of necrotic debris if a patient develops fever, a repeat procedure will be&#xD;
      done within three days. An 8.8 mm diameter, size forward viewing endoscope will be used to&#xD;
      enter the cavity. The cavity will be lavaged with saline and loose necrotic tissue will be&#xD;
      removed with snare or basket.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operative data will be recorded in a preformed proforma on port placements, mode of&#xD;
      gastrotomy, location of the pseudocyst, operation time, associated procedures performed,&#xD;
      conversion to open, any intraoperative complication and other intra-operative details.&#xD;
      Reasons for conversion to open and procedure performed after conversion will also be&#xD;
      recorded. Data regarding endoscopic procedure will also be recorded in a prestructured&#xD;
      proforma on the technique, mode of gastrotomy, procedure time, any complication encountered&#xD;
      during the procedure and other intraprocedural details. The number of procedures and hospital&#xD;
      stay will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Details of any associated procedures like endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreaticography&#xD;
      (ERCP) or Common bile duct (CBD) stone removal will be recorded. An ERCP will not be done&#xD;
      routinely prior to drainage to find out any communication of the cyst with main pancreatic&#xD;
      duct (MPD). In patients with recurrence within four weeks an ERCP will be done to rule out&#xD;
      ductal communication and a pancreatic stent will be placed if a fistula is found in both&#xD;
      surgical and endoscopic groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post intervention Evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data regarding post operative/post endoscopic recovery and complications such as bleeding,&#xD;
      wound infection, haematemesis, fever, intra abdominal collection and any drainage performed&#xD;
      will be collected. Post operative/post procedural amylase levels and ultrasound findings will&#xD;
      also be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hospital Stay&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post procedure hospital stay would be recorded in days. Follow up&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be followed up in the post operative period for at least 3 months. The&#xD;
      first follow up will be at seven days, then at 4 weeks and then 3 months after surgery. An&#xD;
      ultrasound will be done at each follow up to look for cyst recurrence or any other&#xD;
      intra-abdominal problem. A note of any additional procedures or admissions after the index&#xD;
      intervention will be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cost of procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      This includes both direct and indirect costs incurred by the patient and the hospital for the&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be entered into Microsoft excel software and will be analyzed by using&#xD;
      Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software version 15. The statistical&#xD;
      method applied will be student t-test/ Mann Whitney U test, whichever is applicable to&#xD;
      compare the continuous data between the two groups and the categorical variables will be&#xD;
      compared using Chi - Square test/ Fisher exact test. A P-value of &lt;0.05 will be considered as&#xD;
      significant.&#xD;
