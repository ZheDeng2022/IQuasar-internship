      Background: Despite the widespread use of external ventricular drainage, revision rates and&#xD;
      associated complications are reported between 10-40%. Current available image-guided&#xD;
      techniques using stereotaxis, endoscopy or ultrasound for catheter placements remain&#xD;
      time-consuming techniques. Recently, a phone-assisted guide with high precision has been&#xD;
      described. The development of an easy-to-use, portable, image-guided system could reduce the&#xD;
      need for multiple passes and improve the rate of accurate catheter placement. This study aim&#xD;
      to compare prospectively in a randomized controlled manner the accuracy of the freehand pass&#xD;
      technique versus an an easy-to-use, portable mini-tablet-assisted guide for ventriculostomy&#xD;
      catheter placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods/Design: This is a single center, prospective, randomized, trial with blinded endpoint&#xD;
      (ventricle catheter tip location) assessment. Adult patients with the indication for&#xD;
      ventriculostomy, as proven by computed tomography (CT), will be randomly assigned to the&#xD;
      treatment group or the control group. In patients of the treatment group, ventriculostomy&#xD;
      will be performed using a mini-tablet-guided assistance based on preoperative CT imaging.&#xD;
      Patients in the control group will receive standard free-hand ventriculostomy using&#xD;
      anatomical landmarks. The catheter may be placed for external drainage or internal&#xD;
      (ventriculoperitoneal) shunting in both groups. The primary outcome measure is rate of&#xD;
      correct placements of the ventricular catheter, defined as a score of 1 to 3 on grading&#xD;
      system for catheter tip location on postoperative CT scan. Primary outcome will be determined&#xD;
      by one of the authors (NS) blinded for treatment allocation. We aim to include 320 patients&#xD;
      in 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcome Measures include 1) Frequency of placements required, 2) Frequency of&#xD;
      completed placements within the ventricle of the perforated part of the tip of the catheter,&#xD;
      3) Frequency of very early and early shunt failures (revision of the ventricular drainage&#xD;
      within 24 hours / within three weeks, 4) Frequency and Percentage of complications&#xD;
      (procedure-related and nonsurgical) within three weeks, 5) Length of the trajectories from&#xD;
      the dura level to the foramen of Monroe, the angle in the coronal plane towards midline (a)&#xD;
      and towards the target (b) at the respective entry point, 6) ventricle size (the frontal&#xD;
      occipital horn ratio (FOHR) and the width of the lateral ventricle in the coronal plane&#xD;
      between the medial wall of the corpus callosum and the septum), 7) Differences (angles,&#xD;
      distance of catheter tip from target) on the tablet-guided planned and postoperative&#xD;
      trajectory on control computer tomography within 48 hrs (CT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion: Here, we present the study design of a single center prospective randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial to investigate whether tablet-guided application ventriculostomy is superior&#xD;
      to the standard free hand technique. The strengths of this study are: 1. the prospective,&#xD;
      randomized interventional character testing a new easy-to handle guided versus free-hand&#xD;
      ventricular catheter placement, and 2. the power calculation is based on catheter accuracy&#xD;
      using an available grading system for catheter tip location and calculated with use of recent&#xD;
      study results of our own population, supported by data from prominent studies.&#xD;

      Methods Design The Tablet-guided versus freehand ventriculostomy (TABGUIDE) study will be&#xD;
      performed as a 2-arm randomized controlled single-center trial to compare an intervention&#xD;
      group using a guided placement of a ventricular catheter to a control group receiving&#xD;
      standard (free-hand) ventriculostomy with blinded endpoint (catheter tip location)&#xD;
      assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting The present study is in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration. The protocol of&#xD;
      this study was approved by the Ethics Committee on Human Research (CER) of the Medical&#xD;
      Faculty of the University of Geneva, Switzerland (reference number: CER 13-175). At the&#xD;
      planned start of the study at 01. March 2014, the study center will start randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization The randomization will start as soon as possible after consent to the study has&#xD;
      been obtained. Any patient meeting the inclusion criteria and not violating the exclusion&#xD;
      criteria may participate in the TABGUIDE study and be randomized to either a guided or&#xD;
      freehand ventriculostomy, thus defining the two distinct groups &quot; guided &quot; or &quot; freehand &quot;.&#xD;
      Online randomization will be performed by the treating physician in the study center using&#xD;
      permuted blocks, to ensure an equal number of patients in both study arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions - Surgical technique&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is conducted in the neurosurgical department of a swiss single center university&#xD;
      hospital in adult patients with indication for a ventricular drainage (such as hydrocephalus,&#xD;
      slit ventricles, pseudotumor cerebri). Data management and monitoring will be performed by&#xD;
      the Geneva study center and statistical analysis by one of the authors (NS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For guidance, an easy-to handle instrument assisted by a mini-I-pad (mini-tablet)application&#xD;
      software (Apple Inc.) is used in order to achieve precise placement of ventricular catheters&#xD;
      on an every-case basis. The catheter may be placed for external drainage or internal&#xD;
      (ventriculoperitoneal, VP) shunting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients in the guided group, catheter placement is performed in the operating theatre&#xD;
      during anesthesia under routine sterile conditions and antibiotic prophylaxis. The&#xD;
      phone-assisted technique used for guided placing of a ventricular catheter through an burr&#xD;
      hole has been previously described in detail. The only difference is the use of a easy-to-use&#xD;
      portable mini-tablet available for all neurosurgeons instead of a phone. In brief, the&#xD;
      patient is positioned and draped in typical sterile fashion for ventriculostomy (if necessary&#xD;
      enlarged for shunt placement). Using a standard adult perforator (14 mm; AESCULAP, Germany),&#xD;
      a frontal burr hole is made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The guiding instrument consists of a base with three pins in order to be rigidly placed on&#xD;
      the bone surface over the burr hole. A semicircular guide rod is mounted to the base in which&#xD;
      an angle scale is engraved. Within the guide rod, a tube can be individually adjusted in one&#xD;
      orientation at different angulations with a range from -600 to 600. Different tubes are&#xD;
      designed with inner diameters of 2, 2.5, and 3 mm in order to guide catheters at different&#xD;
      sizes. At the respective angle adjustment, the tube is fixed to the guide rod by a mounting&#xD;
      screw. The base is opened at one side to enable the view or insert any instrument towards the&#xD;
      lower opening of the tube. The guiding tool is positioned parallel to the midline along the&#xD;
      engraved linear markings on the base of the instrument. Thereby, a rectangular insertion&#xD;
      towards the sagittal convexity and an individual insertion angle towards the coronal tangent&#xD;
      at the entry point can be established via the tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After dura opening, once the appropriate trajectory is chosen, the catheter is inserted&#xD;
      according to the precalculated insertion angle. After tactile feedback of entering the&#xD;
      ventricle, the stylet is removed. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage ensures that the&#xD;
      ventricular catheter is sufficiently in place. Catheters deemed to be suboptimally placed are&#xD;
      repositioned when necessary. We rely on length markings on the ventricular catheter and, when&#xD;
      possible, flow through the distal catheter to ensure the catheter has not been moved after&#xD;
      fixation on the skin and is continuing to provide a conduit for CSF. The remainder of the&#xD;
      possibly following shunt procedure or connection to a Ommaya reservoir was performed with&#xD;
      standard techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The classical freehand technique uses anatomical landmarks and the catheter is placed in the&#xD;
      anterior horn of the lateral ventricle through a burr hole just anterior to the coronal&#xD;
      suture in the pupillary line (at the level of Kocher's point, a point on the surface of the&#xD;
      cranium 2.5 cm from the midline and 1 cm anterior to the coronal suture). The target is the&#xD;
      ipsilateral frontal horn just anterior to the foramen of Monroe to avoid the chorioid plexus.&#xD;
      The right nondominant side is preferred. The catheter is directed freehand using external&#xD;
      landmarks in the coronar plane towards the ipsilateral medial canthus and in the sagittal&#xD;
      plane through the external auditory meatus. A post-procedural CT scan of the brain is&#xD;
      performed within 24 hours as part of standard care for postoperative control or earlier in&#xD;
      case of postoperative CSF drainage problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mini-Tablet application Regular digital imaging (DICOM) viewing software, commonly used in&#xD;
      clinics, to evaluate radiological imaging, integrates simple measurement tools (e.g. distance&#xD;
      or angle measurements). This technique is used to define a trajectory with an entry point at&#xD;
      the frontal paramedian convexity towards the foramen of Monroe in a coronal section. Then,&#xD;
      measurements can be taken to determine the angle between the trajectory and the respective&#xD;
      tangent at the entry point on the skull surface. An I-Phone (Apple Inc., USA) software&#xD;
      application available is used, importing anonymous imaging material. This image should be a&#xD;
      coronal section with the lateral ventricles shown at the level of the anterior commissure.&#xD;
      The next step is to define a paramedian entry point on the surface of the skull by tapping&#xD;
      the finger on the respective spot. Then, the two feet are virtually placed on the skull&#xD;
      surface. A rectangular trajectory orientation of the tube is then shown as a dotted line and&#xD;
      can be shifted if necessary. The angle deviation from a rectangular insertion is then given&#xD;
      by the software as a value. In addition, the finger may be placed on the target within the&#xD;
      ventricle, and the length of the catheter will be given as distance value. As alternative,&#xD;
      the CT scan (at the level : coronal section with the lateral ventricles shown at the level of&#xD;
      the anterior commissure) can be photographed and used for angle calculations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent procedure Patients capable of consenting will be informed about the study details&#xD;
      themselves and may or may not agree to participate. If the patient or his/her legal&#xD;
      representative refuses consent after inclusion by advice of an independent physician, the&#xD;
      patient's further study participation is no longer possible. In this case, however, the&#xD;
      patient or his/her legal representative is asked to give consent for evaluation of already&#xD;
      acquired data. The detailed explanation of the study to the patient, legal representative has&#xD;
      to be carried out using appropriate explanations and words depending on the previous medical&#xD;
      knowledge of the respective person and her/his level of education. During the explanations,&#xD;
      the respective person will be asked on a regular basis if she/he understands the conveyed&#xD;
      information and if any questions have arisen. In addition to these verbal explanations the&#xD;
      patient/legal representative will be given a leaflet containing the study details. After&#xD;
      reading the leaflet the respective person will be given as much time as she/he demands for&#xD;
      the decision on study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study evaluates the outcome of an intervention performed often in an emergency&#xD;
      situation. Since approximately half of patients will not be able to give informed consent at&#xD;
      admission, the informed consent procedure for this study will be delayed in a so-called&#xD;
      emergency procedure. If neither the patient is capable of giving informed consent nor a&#xD;
      family representative (informed consent) is available in due time, an independent&#xD;
      neurosurgeon not involved in the patient's treatment nor in the trial may be asked for study&#xD;
      approval. This option was introduced into the consent procedure because data on smart-phone&#xD;
      guided ventriculostomy suggest a potentially beneficial effect of the measure for the patient&#xD;
      - however performed in a small group of 35 patients. Therefore it shall not be categorically&#xD;
      withheld from patients who are not capable of deciding whether to participate in the study or&#xD;
      not and who do not have a legal representative. As soon as a legal representative / family&#xD;
      representative is available and/or the patient is capable again to consent to the study, he&#xD;
      or she must be asked to give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Analysis Sample size analysis estimates (hit and miss rates) were based on the&#xD;
      results of observational studies. In a recent single center study of our group on the&#xD;
      accuracy of ventricular catheter placement, using anatomic landmarks versus neuronavigation&#xD;
      or CT-laser guidance, ventricles were hit in 69.2% of catheter insertions (31% miss rate)&#xD;
      using anatomical landmarks (non-assisted), as compared to 82.3% with the use of guidance&#xD;
      (neuronavigation or CT-guidance, p=0.043) (submitted data). The placements that were&#xD;
      non-assisted were significantly more likely to be placed extraventricularly than those using&#xD;
      guidance (OR 3.73, 95%, Confidence Interval (CI) 1.24, 11.19, p=0.019). Given data from other&#xD;
      retrospective studies on ventricular catheters (in the context of ventricular-peritoneal&#xD;
      shunts), similar rates between 25-45%4-7 of malpositioning are described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To detect a decrease in the incidence of malpositioning from 35% to 20, 151 patients in each&#xD;
      of the two study arms are needed to gain a power of 80%, using an alpha error of 5%. The&#xD;
      final planned study size is to include and randomize 302 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Management Data specified in the trial protocol will be documented in the patient's&#xD;
      digital records. Additional clinical data are available from the electronic patient files.&#xD;
      The investigating physician is responsible for appropriate completion of the form. The&#xD;
      authors (AS, NS) are responsible for data base development, data acquisition, data storage,&#xD;
      and validation. Data validation includes controls of completeness, consistence and&#xD;
      plausibility of the data documented in electronic dossier using a query system between data&#xD;
      management and investigating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;

      Reporting &amp; Statistical Analysis The reporting of this trial will conform to the reporting&#xD;
      guidelines outlined in the CONSORT statement of 2010. The statistical analysis will be by&#xD;
      intention-to-treat. The occurrence of the primary outcome, number and frequency of correct&#xD;
      ventriculostomy, will be compared between the two randomization groups. The secondary outcome&#xD;
      analyses will compare the above described variables between randomization groups. Subgroup&#xD;
      analyses will be performed to evaluate whether other parameters such as age, ventricle size,&#xD;
      diagnosis or experience of the surgeon may influence the results. Data are presented as mean&#xD;
      and standard deviation or as median with 25/75 percentiles. Stata version 11.2 (College&#xD;
      Station, Texas) will be used for all analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interim analyses This trial will follow a group sequential design, with 2 stop-points&#xD;
      (interim and final analysis). The trial will stop if efficacy rules are met. The endpoints&#xD;
      assessed at the first stop-point will be based on primary outcomes and adverse events. The&#xD;
      first will be the interim analysis will occur after the accrual of 50 patients in each arm&#xD;
      (100 total) thus representing approximately 1/3 of trial accrual. For the efficacy&#xD;
      stop-point, a p-value of 0.001 at interim and 0.05 at final analysis will be used.&#xD;
