    <textblock>
      In this first in human study the aim is to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics of 2B3-201 in a randomized, first in human, double-blind, placebo- and&#xD;
      active comparator- controlled 3-way crossover study in 18 healthy male subjects (part 1).&#xD;
      Furthermore, the findings obtained from part 1 will be extended and confirmed in a subsequent&#xD;
      parallel open label study in 18 healthy male and 12 MS patients and an open label study with&#xD;
      methylprednisolone as comparator in 12 female volunteers (part 2).&#xD;
