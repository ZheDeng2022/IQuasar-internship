  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are recent advances in therapies for the treatment of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM)&#xD;
      which include the GLP1 analogues and the DPP IV inhibitors. Both of these therapies target&#xD;
      the incretin system using different methods to elevate/maintain circulating levels of GLP1 to&#xD;
      subsequently achieve improved blood sugar control. Interestingly, GLP1 analogues have been&#xD;
      reported not only to improve blood sugar control but to additionally induce weight-loss and&#xD;
      emerging experimental evidence has shown it may have beneficial effects on the heart's&#xD;
      structure and function. Due to the profile of this condition being a lot worse and younger&#xD;
      patients having greater CVD risk, a therapy offering multiple positive effects, in particular&#xD;
      the potential cardiometabolic effects, make this line of therapy attractive in this patient&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this research is to investigate the cardiometabolic effects of Liraglutide (GLP1&#xD;
      analogue) compared to that of its clinically relevant comparator Sitagliptin (DPP IV&#xD;
      inhibitor).&#xD;

      T2DM in the young&#xD;
&#xD;
      T2DM has traditionally been associated with older age, with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) being the&#xD;
      dominant form in younger populations. This traditional profile has dramatically altered over&#xD;
      the last couple of decades; the sharp rise in levels of obesity and sedentary lifestyles&#xD;
      witnessed in younger age groups in developed countries has resulted in up to a 10 fold&#xD;
      increase in the prevalence of T2DM in younger adults and youth [7]. Whereas T2DM was once a&#xD;
      rarity in those under 40 years, we have recently shown that T2DM now represents up to 20% of&#xD;
      all registered diabetes cases across centres in Leicester and Sheffield in this age group&#xD;
      [8]. More worryingly, sub-analysis of the Leicester arm of the international ADDITION study&#xD;
      [9], a large population-based screening study that included a small cohort under 40 years of&#xD;
      age (n = 445), and an on-going NPRI-MRC study in younger high risk adults, suggest the&#xD;
      prevalence of undiagnosed T2DM in those under 40 years is between 2 to 4% depending on the&#xD;
      diagnostic criteria used and over 5% in those with a family history or obesity (unreported&#xD;
      observations). The focus of health care policy and research has lagged behind this&#xD;
      substantive shift in the profile of T2DM towards younger populations. For example, the NHS&#xD;
      health checks programme is targeted at those over 40 years of age while previous&#xD;
      self-management, lifestyle and pharmaceutical interventions which have been used to inform&#xD;
      NICE guidance have been conducted in groups aged between 50 and 70 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Burden of T2DM in the young&#xD;
&#xD;
      The onset of T2DM in younger adults and youth represents an extreme phenotype that magnifies&#xD;
      the disease profile observed in older adults. For example, those diagnosed with T2DM under 40&#xD;
      years are more likely to be classified with Class II or Class III obesity (â‰¥35 kg/m2), have a&#xD;
      multigenerational family history of T2DM, lead a sedentary lifestyle and be of minority&#xD;
      ethnic origin [7]. Of particular concern is that the onset of T2DM in younger adults is&#xD;
      associated with dramatic elevations in the risk of cardiovascular disease, particularly&#xD;
      coronary heart disease. For example, the risk of any macrovascular complication in younger&#xD;
      adults with T2DM compared to controls has been shown to be twice as high compared to other&#xD;
      T2DM patients (HR 7.9 vs. 3.8, respectively)[10]. Myocardial infarction (MI) was found to be&#xD;
      the most common macrovascular outcome; the hazard of developing an MI in younger adults with&#xD;
      T2DM was 14-fold higher than in control subjects [10]. In contrast, older adults with T2DM&#xD;
      had less than four times the risk of developing an MI compared with control subjects. Others&#xD;
      have reported that the mortality rate in young people with T2DM was as high as 9% over a 9&#xD;
      year period [11]. Younger people with T2DM therefore have higher complication rates than&#xD;
      their peers with Type 1 diabetes, despite a shorter duration of diabetes, highlighting the&#xD;
      aggressive nature of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our group has recently completed a Medical Research Council (MRC) funded study aimed at&#xD;
      elucidating the biochemical and cardiac abnormalities associated with T2DM in younger adults&#xD;
      (18 to 40 years). The study recruited 20 young adults (18 to 40 years) with diagnosed T2DM&#xD;
      and 20 age-matched metabolically healthy obese and lean controls (paper under preparation).&#xD;
      Cardiac structure and function were assessed by state-of-the-art tagged cardiac MRI imaging.&#xD;
      The most striking finding from this study was evidence of greater diastolic dysfunction in&#xD;
      T2DM compared to both the obese and lean controls. Specifically, peak end diastolic strain&#xD;
      rate, a highly sensitive measure of left ventricular (LV) diastolic function, had an average&#xD;
      value of 1.27 s-1 in the T2DM cohort (the lower limit of normal ranges has been defined as&#xD;
      1.3 s-1) which was 20% lower than the obese controls and 30% lower than the lean controls.&#xD;
      This finding is consistent with a larger study that used echocardiography to assess cardiac&#xD;
      function and structure in over 150 adolescents and younger adults with T2DM compared to obese&#xD;
      and lean controls; this study reported that diastolic dysfunction was reduced from lean to&#xD;
      obese and from obese to T2DM. These studies therefore suggest that pre-clinical diastolic&#xD;
      dysfunction is already manifest in younger adults with T2DM, despite their relatively young&#xD;
      age and short duration of type 2 diabetes. This finding is highly clinically relevant and&#xD;
      suggests that the high risk of cardiovascular disease observed in T2DM is predominantly&#xD;
      characterised by diastolic dysfunction predisposing these patients to heart failure, in&#xD;
      advance of overt systolic compromise [12,13]. For example, 50% of all cases of chronic heart&#xD;
      failure have preserved ejection fraction [12,13]. Therefore therapeutic strategies that&#xD;
      target both glycaemic control and diastolic cardiac function would be highly desirable in&#xD;
      younger adults with T2DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GLP-1 THERAPY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditional therapies in the management of T2DM have focused on enhancing the secretion,&#xD;
      action and availability of insulin. However, whilst these approaches have been successful in&#xD;
      managing blood glucose levels, they have had only modest benefit in reducing rates of&#xD;
      myocardial infarction and are associated with a number of deleterious side effects, including&#xD;
      hypoglycaemia, bone fractures, congestive heart failure, weight gain, and, in some analyses,&#xD;
      increased mortality [14]. Therefore the development of new therapies simultaneously targeting&#xD;
      hyperglycaemia and cardiovascular disease is a major priority. Two recently approved classes&#xD;
      of incretin based therapies, glucagon like peptide -1 (GLP-1) analogues and dipeptidyl&#xD;
      peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, have shown promise in these areas. Both classes exert their&#xD;
      actions through potentiation of incretin receptor signalling, particularly GLP-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In vivo GLP-1 is predominately secreted from the L-cells of the distal jejunum, ileum and&#xD;
      colon. Low basal levels are secreted in the fasting state, however, levels rapidly and&#xD;
      transiently increase in response to the ingestion of food; secretagogues include the major&#xD;
      macronutrients, particularly glucose. Endogenous GLP-1 has a short half-life of only 1 - 2&#xD;
      minutes following rapid degradation by the enzyme DPP-4 [15].&#xD;
&#xD;
      GLP-1 receptors are widespread throughout the body including in the pancreas, stomach lining,&#xD;
      intestine, brain and heart. The widespread distribution of GLP-1 receptors supports a&#xD;
      diversity of pleiotropic effects. Other than the direct effect on appetite regulation, the&#xD;
      most widely investigated action of GLP-1 has been around the homeostasis of glucose levels.&#xD;
      GLP-1 is known to stimulate insulin secretion in a glucose dependant manor (thus limiting&#xD;
      risk of hypoglycaemia), as well as promoting glucose stimulated insulin gene transcription&#xD;
      and biosynthesis [14]. It may also have trophic effects on pancreatic beta-cells. Given these&#xD;
      glucose dependant effects, GLP-1 therapies have been developed as treatment strategies in the&#xD;
      management of T2DM. Due to the short half-life of native GLP-1, therapies have revolved&#xD;
      around inhibiting the action of DPP-4 and thus augmenting naturally occurring levels of the&#xD;
      incretin hormones, or through the intravenous administration of GLP-1 analogues which are&#xD;
      resistant to the action of DPP-4. In contrast to DPP-4 inhibitors, GLP-1 analogues can be&#xD;
      administered at supra-physiological levels and thus lead to more profound receptor activation&#xD;
      and biological effects. This is particularly true in relation to weight-loss, where GLP-1&#xD;
      analogues have been shown to directly induce substantial weight loss with greater effect seen&#xD;
      with higher levels of obesity. In contrast, DPP-4 inhibitors appear weight neutral.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both DPP-4 inhibitors, such as Sitagliptin Vildagliptin and Linagliptin and GLP-1 such as&#xD;
      Liraglutide and Exenatide are licensed for use in the management of T2DM within the United&#xD;
      Kingdom.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liraglutide is the most recently approved GLP-1 analogue therapy and has the greatest promise&#xD;
      in terms of glycaemic efficacy and weight loss. The Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes&#xD;
      (LEAD) studies have demonstrated that when used in combination with one or more OADs, doses&#xD;
      of 1.2 or 1.8 mg of Liraglutide daily significantly reduce HbA1c (mean HbA1c decrease:&#xD;
      1.0-1.5%) [16-22]. Clinically important decreases in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and&#xD;
      postprandial plasma glucose (PPG) levels have also been well documented following Liraglutide&#xD;
      treatment (mean FPG decrease: -1.6 to 2.2 mmol/l and 1.55 to 2.4 mmol/l with 1.2 and 1.8 mg&#xD;
      Liraglutide, respectively [16-23]; mean PPG decrease: 2.3-2.6 and 1.81-2.7 mmol/l with 1.2&#xD;
      and 1.8 mg Liraglutide, respectively [16-19]). Liraglutide has also proven to have superior&#xD;
      effects on glycaemic control compared to other licensed GLP-1 analogues and DPP-4 inhibitors&#xD;
      [20,21].&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to improved glycaemic control, Liraglutide is also effective at inducing weight&#xD;
      loss and reducing blood pressure. Mean body weight reductions of at least 1 kg were apparent&#xD;
      with both doses of Liraglutide (-1.0 to -2.9 kg with 1.2 mg; -1.8 to -3.4 kg with 1.8 mg)&#xD;
      [17-21]. Greater decreases in body weight were exhibited by patients with a higher adiposity&#xD;
      [23]. Furthermore, when used in daily doses of 2.4 mg or more, Liraglutide has been shown to&#xD;
      have a greater effect on body weight than Orlistat [24]. Mean reductions in systolic blood&#xD;
      pressure of up to 6 mmHg have also been reported [22]&#xD;
&#xD;
      GLP-1 ANALOGUE THERAPY BLOOD PRESSURE AND HEART RATE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observed systolic blood pressure reduction of up to 6 mmHg with Liraglutide would be expected&#xD;
      to result in a 15 to 25% reduction in cardiovascular event rate independent of any glucose&#xD;
      lowering effect [25]. It is hypothesized a GLP-1 receptor independent nitric oxide mediated&#xD;
      vasodilatory pathway is responsible for this, and other potentially beneficial cardiovascular&#xD;
      effects on endothelial function, renal sodium excretion and PAI-1 (Plasminogen Activator&#xD;
      Inhibitor). GLP-1 receptor activation may also induce sympathetic autonomic activity which&#xD;
      stimulates myocyte glucose uptake as well as provoking a positive chronotropic and inotropic&#xD;
      response. Although recent reviews suggest these pleiotropic actions have no detrimental&#xD;
      effect on cardiovascular events, the clinical significance of a modest elevation in resting&#xD;
      heart rate with this treatment is currently unclear [26,27]. Liraglutide is now licensed for&#xD;
      use in Europe, Canada, Japan, Mexico and the USA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GLP-1 ANALOGUE THERAPY AND CARDIAC FUNCTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clearly, substantial clinical benefits accrue from the glucose and weight lowering properties&#xD;
      of GLP-1 analogue therapy. However, emerging experimental evidence suggests that GLP-1&#xD;
      therapy has specific cardioprotective effects that are independent of whole body glucose&#xD;
      metabolism. In particular, along with improvements in endothelial function, GLP-1 treatment&#xD;
      has been shown to have direct effects on cardiac function and structure. For example, rat and&#xD;
      canine models of heart failure/cardiomyopathy have demonstrated that GLP-1 administration is&#xD;
      associated with improved cardiac output, decreased left ventricular end-diastolic volume and&#xD;
      reduced myocyte apoptosis [for recent reviews see 28,29]. Furthermore, mice lacking the GLP-1&#xD;
      receptor were reported to have LV diastolic dysfunction, greater LV wall thickening and&#xD;
      impaired LV contractile function [30]. Although limited, human studies have confirmed a link&#xD;
      between GLP-1 treatment and cardiac function and structure. For example, after 5 weeks of&#xD;
      GLP-1 therapy, 12 patients with chronic heart failure improved their LV function as well as&#xD;
      their exercise capacity [31]. Similarly, 72 hours of GLP-1 infusion was associated with&#xD;
      improved LV ejection fraction in survivors of acute myocardial infarction [32] and Exenatide&#xD;
      administered during percutaneous coronary intervention reduced reperfusion injury and infarct&#xD;
      size [33]. Although promising, these studies are limited by their small samples and the&#xD;
      non-randomised methodology. However several randomised trials have recently been published.&#xD;
      In one study 20 patients were randomised to GLP-1 or saline infusion after percutaneous&#xD;
      coronary intervention; GLP-1 was found to ameliorate LV dysfunction [34]. Another randomised&#xD;
      cross-over study demonstrated that GLP-1 therapy improved LV function in 14 patients with&#xD;
      coronary artery disease [35].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whilst the above findings are highly promising, data is lacking around the efficacy of GLP-1&#xD;
      therapy at improving cardiac function in high risk populations without overt cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease. This limitation is particularly relevant to young individuals with T2DM who are&#xD;
      likely to have extreme levels of obesity and present with sub-clinical diastolic dysfunction.&#xD;
      Therefore research is needed to investigate to what extent GLP-1 therapy can ameliorate the&#xD;
      early stages of cardiac dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to determine if Liraglutide, a GLP-1 analogue, leads to&#xD;
      improved LV diastolic function in younger adults with T2DM compared to the clinical relevant&#xD;
      active comparator Sitagliptin, a DPP-4 inhibitor.&#xD;
