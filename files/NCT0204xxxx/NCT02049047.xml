  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given the high expression of IGF-1R and pAKT proteins in thymoma tissues, able to sensitize&#xD;
      tumors to mTOR inhibition, and the anticancer activity of the mTOR inhibitors, clinical&#xD;
      evaluation in thymoma and thymic carcinoma seems to be very interesting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive continuous treatment with oral everolimus 10 mg once daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy and safety profile of Everolimus will be evaluated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will receive continuous treatment with oral everolimus 10 mg once daily. Study drug&#xD;
      will be self-administered orally (two 5 mg tablets) daily in a fasting state or with a light&#xD;
      fat-free meal. Each cycle will be considered as 21 days of treatment; safety was assessed&#xD;
      every 21 days. Tumor assessement will be done every two cycles. Treatment should be&#xD;
      administered until documented disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient refusal.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histological diagnosis of invasive recurrent or metastatic thymoma or thymic carcinoma&#xD;
             confirmed by pathologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least one prior platinum-containing chemotherapy regimen. There is no limit to the&#xD;
             number of prior chemotherapy regimens received. Progressive disease should have been&#xD;
             documented before entry into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in&#xD;
             at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as greater than 20 mm with&#xD;
             conventional techniques or as greater than 10 mm with spiral CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have recovered from toxicity related to prior therapy to at least to&#xD;
             grade 1 (defined by CTCAE 3.0).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No major surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, biologic therapy (including any&#xD;
             investigational agents), or hormonal therapy (other than replacement), within 4 weeks&#xD;

             (ULN), AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT)&gt;= 3 x institutional ULN (5x if LFT elevations due to liver&#xD;
             metastases, )Creatinine &lt;= 1.5 x institutional ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with symptomatic brain metastases. However, patients who have had treatment&#xD;
             for their brain metastases and whose brain metastatic disease status has remained&#xD;
             stable for at least 3 months without steroids may be enrolled at the discretion of the&#xD;
             investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major surgery, other than diagnostic surgery, within 4 weeks prior to treatment&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or breast feeding women&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous (within the last 5 years) or current malignancies at other sites, except for&#xD;
             adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer or in situ carcinoma of the&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Current enrollment in or participation in another therapeutic clinical trial within 4&#xD;

             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or may&#xD;
             interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgement of the&#xD;
             Investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study or could&#xD;
             compromise protocol objectives in the opinion of the Investigator and/or the Sponsor.&#xD;
