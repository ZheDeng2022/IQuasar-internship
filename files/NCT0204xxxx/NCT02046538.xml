    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish the safety of Zaltrap in patients who undergo&#xD;
      pre-operative chemotherapy with Zaltrap. The investigators hypothesize that Zaltrap my impact&#xD;
      colorectal cancer growth and metastasis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible patients will receive 3 months of chemotherapy consisting of either FOLFOX or&#xD;
      FOLFIRI (in the case of liver limited CRC) or FOLFOX (in the case of rectal cancer). The&#xD;
      FOLFOX regimen consists of Oxaliplatin, Leucovorin, and 5-FU. The FOLFIRI regimen consists of&#xD;
      Irinotecan, Leucovorin, and 5-FU. Zaltrap will be administered with chemotherapy every 2&#xD;
      weeks for the first 5 out of 6 planned treatment cycles. After a standard 3-4 week recovery&#xD;
      period (i.e. 5-6 week's from the last Zaltrap dose), patients will undergo standard&#xD;
      resection. At the time of resection, the tumor will be collected for biomarker discovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following resection, patients will be randomly assigned (1:1) to receive chemotherapy with or&#xD;
      without zaltrap for 3 additional months. Patients assigned to Zaltrap may continue zaltrap&#xD;
      (without chemotherapy) until disease recurrence or up to an additional 15 months. Patients&#xD;
      will have research blood draws periodically both in the preoperative and postoperative&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to demonstrate that pre-operative chemotherapy with Zaltrap is not&#xD;
      associated with any safety signals that would preclude further drug development in this&#xD;
      patient population. The investigators also plan to perform correlative studies to identify&#xD;
      potential biomarkers for Zaltrap activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that antiangiogenic therapy may specifically target the&#xD;
      micrometastatis niche of patients with liver limited metastatic colorectal cancer to&#xD;
      significantly increase the chance of cure for these patients.&#xD;
