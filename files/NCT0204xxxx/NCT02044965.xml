  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) remains the mainstay to ensure complete&#xD;
      low-pressure bladder emptying in neurogenic bladder (NB) patients, this forms a vehicle for&#xD;
      bacterial entry and colonization of the urinary tract, which can lead to recurrent urinary&#xD;
      tract infection (RUTI) and renal damage. Up to 25% of NB patients on CIC suffer from RUTI and&#xD;
      daily, low-dose antibiotic prophylaxis is widely prescribed to prevent these infections.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, this therapeutic option is not evidence-based and can be associated with a&#xD;
      higher risk of RUTI secondary to development of antibiotic resistance. In addition, many&#xD;
      children suffer from a range of adverse reactions and emergence of drug resistant organisms.&#xD;
      Moreover, recent studies have shown that antibiotics cause a major disruption in the human&#xD;
      microbiome, potentially leading to long term major problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Probiotics are live microorganisms, which when administered in adequate amounts confer a&#xD;
      health benefit on the host. There is evidence that probiotics restore microbial homeostasis&#xD;
      in the vagina, reduce the risk of pathogen ascension into the bladder, and modulate immunity&#xD;
      to better protect the host. Probiotic strains, including Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1,&#xD;
      Lactobacillus reuteri B-54 and RC-14, have been shown to be safe and efficacious in an oral&#xD;
      formulation or as a vaginal suppository in improving the microbiota profile of the vagina and&#xD;
      decreasing the risk of RUTI. Various mechanisms appear to be involved, including modulating&#xD;
      antimicrobial and inflammatory defenses, up-regulating protective mucin production and&#xD;
      reducing the pressure on pathogens to acquire antibiotic resistance genes. A randomized trial&#xD;
      comparing probiotics to antibiotic prophylaxis in children with vesicoureteric reflux showed&#xD;
      equivalent reduction in the incidence of RUTI and development of new renal scarring. In&#xD;
      addition, down regulation of inflammatory cytokines can potentially favorably alter bladder&#xD;
      function and prevent bladder fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators at London Health Sciences Centre (LHSC) have the opportunity to acquire&#xD;
      clinical data that would strengthen the case for probiotics to be integrated into pediatric&#xD;
      urology practice for managing CIC and RUTI. This would be the first such study in pediatric&#xD;
      NB patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to determine whether the use of probiotics (lactobacilli)&#xD;
      can decrease the impact of adverse side effects and the antibiotic resistance that is seen&#xD;
      with the prolonged use of antibiotics for patients with neurogenic bladder conditions.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      From Dr. Dave's practice 53 suitable patients who are using CIC to manage NB disease, and are&#xD;
      receiving long term, low-dose antibiotic prophylaxis designed to prevent RUTI have been&#xD;
      identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On average, another 5 eligible patients would be expected within a six- month window. From&#xD;
      this pool, the study will enroll 36 adolescents â‰¥ 12 years of age. They will have had a&#xD;
      history of RUTI over the past 12 months and will have been receiving chemoprophylaxis for at&#xD;
      least one month. The study design and reporting will conform to the CONSORT guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be enrolled after informed consent and the baseline evaluation will include a&#xD;
      history and physical examination, and verification of previous culture proven UTI. A urine&#xD;
      sample will be obtained using clean catheterization and subjected to: urinalysis, microbiome,&#xD;
      metabolome, bacteriological culture and antibiotic resistance assessment, and assayed for&#xD;
      markers for inflammation. A stool sample will also be collected to analyse the gut microbiota&#xD;
      and drug resistance profiles of E. coli. Each patient will receive counselling at baseline&#xD;
      and at 3 months follow up on ensuring adequate fluid intake, proper clean intermittent&#xD;
      catheterization technique and frequency, and over the- counter treatment for constipation.&#xD;
      Post catheterization bladder scans will be performed to ensure completeness of bladder&#xD;
      emptying. Baseline bladder and renal function will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators expect interest from the patients/parents in their practice as at the very&#xD;
      least the study will entail a check-up of how their condition is being managed, and for us to&#xD;
      be able to provide them with additional information on their microbiota in urine and stool.&#xD;
      Thus, patients who do not wish to be randomized to receive probiotics or change to a&#xD;
      probiotic regimen, can still be included as a control group remaining on prophylaxis (12&#xD;
      subjects). Investigators would expect their bacterial drug resistance profiles and intestinal&#xD;
      side effects to remain unchanged for the next six months. For 24 subjects interested in being&#xD;
      considered for a different approach to their care, they will be randomized using a computer&#xD;
      generated randomization sequence with balanced block randomization (block size= 4), pre&#xD;
      generated, and allocation performed using sealed envelopes and a third party to preserve&#xD;
      allocation concealment from the recruiting physician. A 1: 1 allotment will be performed to&#xD;
      the 2 study groups: 12 patients will continue antibiotic prophylaxis but also receive daily&#xD;
      probiotic capsules, and the other 12 will be randomized to receive probiotics and a drug&#xD;
      placebo for six months after a washout period of 1 week. Patient and parent blinding will be&#xD;
      partially achieved by each patient taking two pills each day, with the placebo pill or&#xD;
      capsule resembling the active product. The placebo drug used will be a similar appearance&#xD;
      sugar based pill with no active ingredient. The probiotic capsule will contain only food&#xD;
      grade excipients present in the probiotic capsule. Patients will be supplied with their pills&#xD;
      and capsules for 3- month duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the laboratory technician and outcome assessor (data entry and analysis) will be&#xD;
      blinded to patient allotment. Antibiotic prophylaxis will consist of Septra (trimethoprim 2&#xD;
      mg/kg; sulfamethoxazole) (for the 12 controls or 12 randomized to antibiotic and probiotic&#xD;
      arm). Probiotic therapy will comprise of two capsules of RePhResh Pro-B (approved by Health&#xD;
      Canada and sold at Shoppers Drug Mart in Canada), which consists of 5 billion total organisms&#xD;
      of L. rhamnosus GR-1 and L. reuteri RC-14 per capsule. The capsule can be added to milk or&#xD;
      orange juice if the patient is unable to swallow it. All 36 patients/parents will be asked to&#xD;
      keep a diary to record use of medications (OTC medications for colds, flu, others) and will&#xD;
      be asked not to take any probiotic products (including probiotic yogurt) during the study&#xD;
      duration. In addition, patients will fill out a questionnaire each week (study duration is 6&#xD;
      months after the first baseline visit is conducted) to assess a range of potential adverse&#xD;
      events (such as constipation, diarrhea, bloating, nausea, pain, fever) on a scale of 1-10. At&#xD;
      the three month follow-up compliance will be assessed by return of the empty product&#xD;
      containers, and review of the diary. A second course of three month treatment will then be&#xD;
      provided. At three and six month's clinical assessment, urine and stool samples will be&#xD;
      provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 6 month follow-up, patients will receive a renal ultrasound to assess the health of the&#xD;
      upper renal tract, as well as a post-catheterization bladder scan an cystometry. During the&#xD;
      study, any patient with two or more episodes of UTI will be treated with an alternative&#xD;
      antibiotic prophylactic regimen.&#xD;
