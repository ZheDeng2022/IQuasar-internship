  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the use of an FDA approved endoscopic&#xD;
      bipolar catheter (EndoHPB) will ablate tissue in malignant tumors within the pancreatic&#xD;
      ducts.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Only a small proportion of patients with biliary obstruction caused by cholangiocarcinoma or&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer are suitable for surgical resection. Therefore most patients with malignant&#xD;
      biliary obstruction will need palliation of their jaundice to relieve the symptoms of&#xD;
      pruritus, malabsorption, sepsis and to minimize potential hepatorenal complications.&#xD;
      Restoring biliary flow with relief of jaundice is the primary goal in the palliation of&#xD;
      obstructive biliary malignancy. Drainage at endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography&#xD;
      (ECRP) is established as a safer approach than at percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography&#xD;
      (PTC) because it has a lower risk of bile leak, infection and hemorrhage. ECRP is the first&#xD;
      approach to relieve malignant biliary obstruction but sometimes it is not technically&#xD;
      possible to stent the patient by this approach, then a PTC needs to be undertaken. Self&#xD;
      expanding mesh metal stents (SEMS) were introduced back in the 1990s. Problems can still&#xD;
      arise with the use of covered stents such as cholecystitis, pancreatitis or tumor overgrowth&#xD;
      at the end of the stent, and not all studies have shown that covered stents actually reduce&#xD;
      the problems of tumor ingrowth and consequent stent occlusion. EndoHPB can be deployed via an&#xD;
      ERCP or PTC route. By using radiofrequency (RF) energy to heat the tissue in the duct prior&#xD;
      to insertion of the stent, the surrounding tissue becomes coagulated and this may may delay&#xD;
      tumor growth and the time before the stent lumen becomes blocked. Thereby this allows&#xD;
      increased periods between the need for intervention and further stent deployment. If EndoHPB&#xD;
      use of luminal RF is demonstrated to be effective in luminal tumor ablation, it may have an&#xD;
      additional role as a form of neoadjuvant therapy in cholangiocarcinoma and pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
