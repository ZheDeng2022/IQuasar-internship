    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to 1) demonstrate the effectiveness of the innovative&#xD;
      bicycle training program in teaching youth with DS and ASD how to ride a standard two wheel&#xD;
      bike, and 2) determine the effects of the treatment on health related performance measures,&#xD;
      physical activity level, patterns of sleep behavior, psychosocial outcomes, and community&#xD;
      participation. The hypotheses to be tested in this study are: 1) there will be a significant&#xD;
      treatment group difference (EXP vs CON) in the number of participants who demonstrate the&#xD;
      ability to ride a two wheel bicycle in favor of the EXP group following the first year of&#xD;
      training. 2) At the end of the second year of training when the CON group receives the&#xD;
      bicycle training program, there will not be a group difference in the number of riders who&#xD;
      learned to ride. 3) At the end of the first year, there will be a significant treatment group&#xD;
      difference (EXP vs CON) on the health related performance measures, average time spent in&#xD;
      moderate and moderate to vigorous physical activity, patterns of sleep behavior (sleep onset,&#xD;
      frequency of night waking), self and parent perceptions of bicycle riding ability, and&#xD;
      community participation (number of community activities engaged in, frequency of community&#xD;
      participation, number of people they participate with outside of the parents, the number of&#xD;
      community locations in which they participate), in favor of the EXP group. 4) At the end of&#xD;
      the second and third year, the CON group will demonstrate a significant improvement in all of&#xD;
      these measures (a significant improvement from the pre-training measures to the 12 and 24&#xD;
      month measures). 5) At the end of the third year, the EXP group will demonstrate a&#xD;
      significant group difference on all measures compared to the CON group but the magnitude of&#xD;
      the difference will be less than was observed in hypothesis 3 at the 12 month measurement&#xD;
      before the CON group received their training. These hypotheses will be tested separately for&#xD;
      the DS and ASD groups.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Two-wheel bicycle riding skills are considered a societal norm for children and youth in&#xD;
      America as well as a life altering activity (Klein, 2004). Most children learn how to ride a&#xD;
      bicycle by the age of 7 years. Children with disabilities often require more time to learn&#xD;
      functional motor behavior skills and in order to successfully accomplish these skills,&#xD;
      children with disabilities also require specialized instruction. Consequently, many children&#xD;
      with disabilities never learn how to ride a two-wheel bicycle. If children with disabilities&#xD;
      do learn how to ride a two-wheel bicycle, they tend to learn much later than children without&#xD;
      disabilities. In the Down syndrome population, it is estimated that less than 10% ever learn&#xD;
      to ride a two wheel bicycle. Learning to ride a two-wheel bicycle allows children to&#xD;
      participate in this leisure activity with siblings and peers (Klein, 2004). This is true for&#xD;
      children with Down syndrome (DS) and children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). In our&#xD;
      previous research, a specialized adapted bicycle has been successfully used to teach children&#xD;
      with Down syndrome how to master this important functional motor skill. In our previous&#xD;
      research, we successfully trained 62% of children with DS to ride in 5 days (75 minutes per&#xD;
      day for 5 days) and as a result, they displayed significantly less time in sedentary activity&#xD;
      and significantly more time in moderate to vigorous activity 12 months following training&#xD;
      compared to the control group. Of the 62% of children with DS who learned to ride, 54% were&#xD;
      still riding 18-24 months after receiving the training.The children start learning how to&#xD;
      ride the two-wheel bicycle on a very stable adapted bicycle (thick roller wheels attached to&#xD;
      the rear wheel) and quickly progress towards a standard two-wheel bike. The results of our&#xD;
      first bicycle study suggested that the 38% who did not reach mastery of riding a two wheel&#xD;
      bike needed more follow up training. In our most recent study, we increased the standard used&#xD;
      to classify the child as an independent rider from 30 feet to more than 100 feet, provided&#xD;
      follow-up training on several weekends, and linked the rider with community bicycle riding&#xD;
      clubs to help insure that they continue to ride following the formal individualized training.&#xD;
      In our most recent study, we successfully trained 62% of children with DS and 94% of children&#xD;
      with ASD to ride a two wheel bicycle 100 feet in five days, 75 minutes each day. Most of&#xD;
      those who learned were able to ride much longer distances than 100 feet. Participants in our&#xD;
      new randomized clinical study, will be in the 9-18 year age range. After random assignment,&#xD;
      the experimental group will receive the bicycle intervention training. The control group will&#xD;
      receive an incentive towards individualized instruction of their choice that will increase&#xD;
      their physical activity. Through learning to ride a two wheel bike, it is expected that the&#xD;
      intervention will induce positive changes in functional health related variables including:&#xD;
      waist circumference, percent body fat, knee extensor strength, knee flexor strength, level of&#xD;
      physical activity, standing balance, participation in the community activities, and&#xD;
      psychosocial development. In addition children with ASD are expected to see an improvement in&#xD;
      their pattern of sleeping behavior.&#xD;
