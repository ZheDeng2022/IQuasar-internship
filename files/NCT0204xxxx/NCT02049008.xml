    <textblock>
      The treatment of aggressive periodontitis (AgP) represents a challenge for clinicians,&#xD;
      because there are no standardized protocols for efficient control of the disease. The aim of&#xD;
      this study is to evaluate the effect of multiple applications of antimicrobial photodynamic&#xD;
      therapy (aPDT) as an adjunct to non-surgical periodontal treatment (nsPT) in patients&#xD;
      diagnosed with AgP. Twenty patients with a clinical diagnosis of AgP will be treated in a&#xD;
      split-mouth design study to either aPDT associated with scaling and root planning (SRP) or&#xD;
      SRP only. aPDT will be performed by using a laser light source with 690 nm wavelength&#xD;
      associated with a phenothiazine photosensitizer. The applications will occur in four episodes&#xD;
      (days 0, 2, 7 and 14). All patients will be monitored for 90 days. Clinical assessment of&#xD;
      plaque index, probing depth, clinical attachment level and bleeding on probing will be&#xD;
      performed at baseline (pre-intervention period) and 30 and 90 days after the nsPT.&#xD;
      Subgingival plaque samples will be collected (at baseline and 30 and 90 days after the nsPT)&#xD;
      and the counts of 40 subgingival species will be determined using DNA-DNA checkerboard&#xD;
      hybridization. Gingival crevicular fluid samples will be collected (at baseline and 14, 30&#xD;
      and 90 after the nsTP) for evaluation the volume of fluid (Periotron) and the levels of&#xD;
      Interleukin 1 beta, Interleukin 10 and Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (Luminex). Data obtained&#xD;
      will be statistically analyzed.&#xD;

      Non-Surgical Periodontal Therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seven days prior to the non-surgical periodontal therapy, periapical radiographs will be&#xD;
      taken from the whole mouth of all patients. They will be set in an oral hygiene program (OHP)&#xD;
      according to their specific needs. In this program, patients will be instructed about an&#xD;
      effective self-performed plaque control, including information about the Bass Technique&#xD;
      (Bass, 1954) and interproximal cleaning with dental floss and interdental brushes. They will&#xD;
      be also motivated to brush the dorsal surface of the tongue once a day and will receive a&#xD;
      dentifrice that shall be used throughout the experimental period (Colgate Total®, Anakol Ind.&#xD;
      Com Ltda - Brazil's Kolynos - Colgate Palmolive Co., Sao Bernardo do Campo, SP, Brazil).&#xD;
      After the OHP, subjects will undergo the assessment of clinical periodontal parameters&#xD;
      previously described and the collection of subgingival plaque and GCF in selected sites&#xD;
      (baseline) will be performed. Shortly, patients will receive supragingival scaling and&#xD;
      coronal polishing with prophy cup on all the teeth present in the oral cavity. The&#xD;
      non-surgical periodontal therapy will initiate 7 days after the OHP and initial supragingival&#xD;
      scaling. Within 24 hours, a specialist in Periodontics will perform supra and subgingival&#xD;
      scaling and root planing of all teeth with periodontal involvement, using hand (Gracey&#xD;
      Curettes, Hu-Friedy, Chicago, IL, USA) and ultrasonic instruments. The instrumentation will&#xD;
      be performed on each quadrant until achievement of an adequate cleaning and root planing,&#xD;
      which will be verified with a dental explorer. Individuals will receive professional&#xD;
      prophylaxis biweekly during three months after the end of the nonsurgical periodontal&#xD;
      therapy. On biweekly follow-up visits, patient's cooperation will be monitored by verifying&#xD;
      the status of oral hygiene.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antimicrobial photodynamic Therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a full-mouth scaling and root planning (SRP), the periodontal pockets of teeth selected&#xD;
      to receive antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) will be irrigated with distilled water.&#xD;
      Shortly thereafter, the dye will be applied (phenothiazine hydrochloride- 10mg/mL) from the&#xD;
      bottom of the pocket. After 1 minute, irrigation will be performed with distilled water to&#xD;
      remove the excess of dye. The stained area will be irradiated with a diode laser (660 nm and&#xD;
      a 60 mW/cm²). Six sites per tooth under treatment will be irradiated (10 seconds/ site). The&#xD;
      applications of aPDT will be repeated in the same way until the second week (days: 2, 7,14).&#xD;
      Before the application, the supragingival plaque will be removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will be impressed with alginate in order to obtain models of the dental arches&#xD;
      and elaborate a guide plate made of acetate. This plate will present grooves that will be&#xD;
      used as references to standardize the insertion and tilt of the automated periodontal probe&#xD;
      (Florida Probe System, Florida Probe Corporation, Gainesville, FL, USA). The visible plaque&#xD;
      index for each patient, rated dichotomously (O'Leary et al. 1972), will be determined by the&#xD;
      percentage of tooth surfaces with deposits of plaque stained with disclosing solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following clinical periodontal parameters will be assessed at 6 sites of each tooth&#xD;
      (mesio-buccal, buccal, disto-buccal, mesio-lingual, lingual and disto-lingual): (i) probing&#xD;
      pocket depth (PPD): it will be measured from the gingival margin to the bottom of the pocket;&#xD;
      (ii) gingival recession (GR): it will be measured from the enamelcement junction to the&#xD;
      bottom of the pocket; (iii) clinical attachment level (CAL): it will be measured as PPD + GR&#xD;
      (GR will be equal to 0 whenever the cementenamel junction is covered); (iv) bleeding on&#xD;
      probing (BOP): it will be evaluated dichotomously: the presence of the bleeding will be&#xD;
      considered positive when occurring within 30 seconds from the insertion of the probe for&#xD;
      probing depth; (v) Plaque index (PI): it will be evaluated dichotomously. BOP, PPD, CAL and&#xD;
      GR will be measured at six sites per tooth (mesio-buccal, buccal, disto-buccal,&#xD;
      disto-lingual, lingual and mesio-lingual). All probing measurements will be performed using&#xD;
      an automated periodontal probe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical periodontal parameters and the plaque index of each patient will be recorded at&#xD;
      baseline (pre-intervention), as well as +30 and +90 days after the non-surgical periodontal&#xD;
      therapy. The Kappa index will be used to evaluate the examiner calibration on clinical&#xD;
      periodontal parameters collection in order to calculate the intra-examiner agreement.&#xD;
      According to the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for diagnosis, the acceptable Kappa&#xD;
      index of agreement must be greater than or equal to 0.85 (WHO, 1997). This level of agreement&#xD;
      will be used for calibration of the examiner in this project. Ten patients, each one showing&#xD;
      at least two pairs of contralateral single-rooted teeth with PD ≥ 5 mm on interproximal&#xD;
      sites, will be selected to calibrate the examiner. Each patient will be evaluated on two&#xD;
      separate occasions 48 hours apart in order to obtain the intra-examiner reliability through&#xD;
      the Kappa index.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunological monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline and +14 and +30 and +90 days after the non-surgical periodontal therapy, GCF&#xD;
      samples will be obtained from eight interproximal sites of each patient. The supragingival&#xD;
      plaque from selected teeth will be removed and the sites will be carefully dried with air&#xD;
      jets, and subsequently isolated with sterile cotton rolls. Samples of GCF will be obtained&#xD;
      with papers strips (Periopaper® -Oralflow Inc., Amityville, NY, USA). The papers strips will&#xD;
      be gently inserted into the orifice of the periodontal pocket, remaining 30 seconds&#xD;
      subgingivally. The amount of GCF absorbed will be determined by an electronic measurer of&#xD;
      humid mass (Periotron® -Oralflow Inc., Amityville, NY, USA). Samples will be placed in&#xD;
      sterile Eppendorf tubes stored at - 80°C for cytokines (IL-1β, IL-10 and TNF-a)&#xD;
      quantification (pg/μl) at Genese Laboratory (Genese Produtos Diagnosticos LTDA, Sao Paulo,&#xD;
      SP, Brazil). Cytokines levels will be determined using a three-plex Millipore kit (Millipore&#xD;
      Corporation, Billerica, MA, USA) and the Luminex 100TM system (Luminex, MiraiBio, Alameda,&#xD;
      CA, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microbiological monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline and +30 and +90 days after the non-surgical periodontal therapy, samples of&#xD;
      subgingival plaque will be obtained from eight interproximal sites of each patient. Samples&#xD;
      will be individually analyzed for their content of 40 subgingival bacterial species using the&#xD;
      checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization technique (Socransky et al., 2004a; Socransky et al.,&#xD;
      2004b). The selected teeth will be isolated with sterile cotton rolls and dried with air&#xD;
      jets. Then, the supragingival plaque will be carefully removed using a sterile curette.&#xD;
      Another sterile curette will be used to collect the subgingival plaque, starting from the&#xD;
      bottom of the periodontal pocket to its coronal portion. The samples will be stored in&#xD;
      sterilized Eppendorf tubes and will be processed at the Microbiology Laboratory of the&#xD;
      Guarulhos University (UNG, Guarulhos, SP, Brazil).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The normality and homoscedasticity of the data obtained will be checked. Comparisons within&#xD;
      groups and among groups at different time intervals will be performed through parametric or&#xD;
      non-parametric appropriate tests. The significance level will be set at 5% in all tests. All&#xD;
      calculations will be performed by SPSS software (SPSS, Chicago IL, USA).&#xD;
