  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to (a) measure how brain structure, metabolism (how the brain&#xD;
      uses energy), and function predict response to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for treatment&#xD;
      of depression; and (b) measure how ECT changes brain metabolism and function. We will ask you&#xD;
      to undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at three sessions: (1) prior to your first ECT&#xD;
      therapy session, (2) after having 4-6 ECT therapy sessions, and (3) approximately two months&#xD;
      following your first ECT therapy sessions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We aim to study potential MR imaging biomarkers derived from f-MRI (functional magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging), DTI (diffusion tensor imaging), and proton MR (magnetic resonance)&#xD;
      spectroscopy in patients undergoing ECT for severe depression related to major depressive&#xD;
      disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD). Subjects will undergo an MR imaging session of 1.5&#xD;
      hrs duration at 3 time points: A) prior to initial ECT therapy; B) within 24 hrs following&#xD;
      initial ECT therapy; C) 60-days following initial ECT therapy. Imaging measures will be&#xD;
      correlated with clinical measures of disease severity at time points A and B in order to&#xD;
      ascertain the potential utility of imaging biomarkers for prediction of therapy response. Our&#xD;
      goal is to identify MR imaging biomarkers that may convey prognostic information which could&#xD;
      be useful in the management of depression. Secondarily, the multi-modality MR imaging&#xD;
      approach yielded functional connectivity data (both in the resting state and using an&#xD;
      emotional regulation paradigm), white matter tract-based spatial statistics, and proton MR&#xD;
      spectroscopy-derived metabolic information will facilitate an exploration of the physiologic&#xD;
      mechanisms of ECT therapy. Twelve subjects will be recruited from a clinical population&#xD;
      already diagnosed with a depressive episode requiring ECT. Patients will they be invited to&#xD;
      participate in our study only after they have consented for ECT. Written consent will be&#xD;
      obtained before any study procedures is conducted. Patients meeting any of the exclusion&#xD;
      criteria will be excluded from participating in the study. Collected data will include: a)&#xD;
      measures of depression severity (HAM-D, BDI) and b) multi-modality imaging data (fMRI,&#xD;
      diffusion tensor imaging, proton MR spectroscopy, and anatomic MR imaging).&#xD;

        No more than 20 patients will be enrolled for this study in order to obtain completion of&#xD;
        the study by at least 10 participants. All inpatients with depression, 18 and older, who&#xD;
        are referred for ECT treatment and consent for ECT treatments after a standard pre-ECT&#xD;
        work-up will be considered potential participants for the study. The investigative team&#xD;
        will discuss potential study participation with the primary treatment team.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men and women ages 18 and older&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of major depressive disorder based on the SCID&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Score of 20 or more on the HAM-D at enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to provide informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Referral for ECT, clinical assessment (health screening, i.e. &quot;work-up&quot;) confirming&#xD;
             suitability of receiving ECT, and consent to receive ECT&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to speak English (necessary for SCID) and an 8th grade English reading&#xD;
             equivalency (necessary for completing assessment forms)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Claustrophobia, or the inability to lie still in a confined space&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Magnetic metallic implants (such as screws, pins, shrapnel remnants, aneurysm clips,&#xD;
             artificial heart valves, inner ear (cochlear) implants, artificial joints, and&#xD;
             vascular stents), as these may heat, pull, or twist in the strong magnetic field of&#xD;
             the MRI scanner&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Electronic or magnetic implants, such as pacemakers, as these may stop working&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-removable dental implants, such as braces or permanent retainers, as these will&#xD;
             distort the MRI images we collect (note: filings, crowns, and silver or gold teeth are&#xD;
             OK)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Permanent makeup or tattoos with metallic dyes&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Self-report of pregnancy at intake&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A positive pregnancy test (for females), since the effect of strong magnetic fields on&#xD;
             the developing fetus remains unknown and inconclusive. (We will conduct a pregnancy&#xD;
             test for all female participants on the day of the MRI scan.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A self-reported history of loss of consciousness (greater than 10 minutes)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Physical disabilities that prohibit task performance (such as blindness or deafness)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other condition that the investigator believes might put the participant at risk&#xD;
