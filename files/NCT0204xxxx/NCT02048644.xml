  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigator has recently studied markers of platelet activation in idiopathic pulmonary&#xD;
      fibrosis (IPF) and found that in IPF patients there is a significantly increased platelet&#xD;
      reactivity when compared with controls which is demonstrated by a concentration dependent&#xD;
      increase in platelet-monocyte complex formation, platelet P-selectin expression and platelet&#xD;
      fibrinogen binding in the presence of' the platelet agonists Adenosine diphosphate and L-&#xD;
      Threonyl- L- phenylalanyl- L- leucyl- L- leucyl- L-argininamide (TFLLR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During platelet activation the platelets degranulate releasing numerous profibrotic cytokines&#xD;
      including Transforming growth factor beta and Platelet derived growth factor that are&#xD;
      recognised to be important in the pathogenesis of IPF. It is therefore plausible that the&#xD;
      observed increased platelet reactivity in IPF contributes to the fibrotic process through&#xD;
      local activation and degranulation with release of proinflammatory and profibrotic mediators&#xD;
      within the pulmonary circulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is evidence that corticosteroid treatment may alter platelet adhesion, in a study of&#xD;
      spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) increased circulating glucocorticoid, suppressed&#xD;
      p-selectin expression. p selectin is a transmembrane protein present in the α granules of&#xD;
      platelets. P selectin has a crucial role in platelet aggregation and platelet-leukocyte&#xD;
      interactions, which are both potentially important mechanisms in the initiation and/or&#xD;
      progression of tissue injury and development of thrombosis. In a study of patients with&#xD;
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation these were treated with either β&#xD;
      agonists alone or β agonist and 40mg prednisolone and compared with a control group. At&#xD;
      presentation the COPD patients had higher pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) higher p selectin&#xD;
      and fibrinogen levels but lower Antithrombin III levels (AT III). The pulmonary artery&#xD;
      pressure and fibrinogen levels were found to be significantly decreased in the steroid&#xD;
      treated group whilst the p-selectin levels further increased in the non steroidal therapy&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for the Current Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a significant unmet medical need for the treatment of IPF; the only medication&#xD;
      approved for treatment of IPF in the United Kingdom (UK) is Pirfenidone and outside the UK&#xD;
      there is none. The main goal of the current study is to evaluate the effect of Fostair on the&#xD;
      biomarkers of platelet activation in IPF disease which the investigator believes play a&#xD;
      pivotal role in the pathogenesis of IPF and whether this translates in to a clinically&#xD;
      beneficial effect of Fostair on IPF disease.&#xD;
