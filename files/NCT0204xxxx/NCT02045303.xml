    <textblock>
      Wound healing rate is higher when contact ultrasound therapy is followed by noncontact&#xD;
      ultrasound therapy on sub-acute and chronic lower extremity ulcers of various etiologies&#xD;
      requiring selective debridement, as compared to either Sonoca-180 or MIST Therapy alone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This prospective pilot study is designed to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of a wound&#xD;
      care ultrasound treatment protocol for sub-acute or chronic wounds of the lower extremity and&#xD;
      of any etiology. The Viana-Pompeo (VIP) ultrasound protocol consists of high intensity, low&#xD;
      frequency, contact ultrasound therapy (with Sonoca-180) followed by low intensity,&#xD;
      low-frequency, noncontact ultrasound therapy (with MIST Therapy). Previously published&#xD;
      healing rates for each of the ultrasonic therapy modalities will be used as a comparison.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Physical Therapist will perform the initial assessment and treatment, and devise an&#xD;
      individualized plan of care that involves contact ultrasound followed by noncontact&#xD;
      ultrasound. Subjects may remain in the study for up to 12 weeks, or up to when end of study&#xD;
      criteria is met.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transition from contact mode to noncontact mode will happen when:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Wound is sufficiently clean with â‰¤ 20% of necrotic tissue or adherent slough.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OR&#xD;
&#xD;
      - &gt;= 80% of soft slough is easily removed from the wound bed with mechanical or selective&#xD;
      debridement before or after treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      OR&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Wound bed quality has failed to progress after 3 consecutive contact ultrasound treatments&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the purposes of this study, treatments will be performed 3 times a week. Treatment time&#xD;
      will be dependent on the wound area, at least 20 sec/cm2, per standard protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only the wounds present during Physical Therapy (PT) initial assessment will be included in&#xD;
      the research. If the patient develops new wounds during the course of the research, the&#xD;
      patient will receive appropriate treatment, but such wounds will not be part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the wound clinic setting are allowed to perform home dressing changes as ordered&#xD;
      by the physician in addition to the dressing changes performed by the therapist or wound&#xD;
      clinic nurse on clinic visit days. Patients and/or caregivers will be trained in dressing&#xD;
      changes techniques and must understand the procedure prior to performing dressing changes on&#xD;
      their own.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to ultrasonic treatment and dressing changes, wound debridement may be performed&#xD;
      each visit as needed. Digital photography and wound measurements will also be performed&#xD;
      weekly and as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of PT wound therapy may be before, at, or after the end of the study period. The&#xD;
      beginning of the MIST therapy will depend on the individual characteristics and wound needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A minimum of 4 MIST treatments must be completed for a patient's data to be included the data&#xD;
      analysis in the acute care setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A minimum of 2 treatments per week (goal of 3 per week) must be reached for the 12 week&#xD;
      period for a patient's data to be included in the data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Wound area reduction&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Percent granulation tissue&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Length of the study for ambulatory subjects: 12 weeks from Start of Contact Ultrasound&#xD;
           therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Length of the study for acute care subjects: From Start of Contact Ultrasound therapy up&#xD;
           to 12 weeks or until patient is discharged from the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Wound closure at any point within the length of study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Failure to note improvement in wound area, and/or wound volume, and/or wound bed quality&#xD;
           after 4 consecutive weeks of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3 consecutive missed visits, or a total of 7 missed visits&#xD;
