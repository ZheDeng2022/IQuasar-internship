      Brief Summary This trial was part of a sub-project targeted to diet, thermogenesis and&#xD;
      obesity of a larger multicentre study named &quot;Interaction between nutritional,&#xD;
      social-behavioral and metabolic factors for prevention of cardiovascular disease: development&#xD;
      of nutritional strategies on general population&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ephedrine and caffeine (EC) combination has been widely used in human obesity treatment. It&#xD;
      is known that this drug increases the metabolic rate in both animals and humans. Ephedrine is&#xD;
      an agonist of both α and β-adrenoceptors; moreover, it induces norepinephrine release from&#xD;
      sympathetic neurons. Caffeine increases both norepinephrine and dopamine release and&#xD;
      stimulates the neuronal activity in several brain regions. We hypothesize that EC treatment&#xD;
      might exert a specific effect on lipolysis and thermogenesis by stimulation of beta-3&#xD;
      adrenoreceptors on adipose tissue and by stimulating uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation,&#xD;
      i.e. energy being dissipated as heat rather than being converted to adenosine triphosphate&#xD;
      (ATP)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4-week trial to investigate the effect of&#xD;
      hypocaloric diet alone or coupled to EC treatment of morbidly obese women on thermogenesis,&#xD;
      expression of UCP 3 (in muscle tissue) and of beta-3 adrenoreceptors (in adipose tissue).&#xD;
      Subjects are randomly assigned to EC (200/20 mg) or to placebo administered three times a day&#xD;
      orally together with a energy-deficit diet (70% of resting energy expenditure), starting one&#xD;
      month before undergoing bariatric surgery. Primary study endpoints are weight change analysed&#xD;
      by intention to treat, changes in resting energy expenditure, UCP3 (long and short isoform),&#xD;
      messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) levels in rectus abdominis and immunostaining for beta-3&#xD;
      adrenoreceptors in subcutaneous and omental adipose tissue. Also plasma epinephrine,&#xD;
      norepinephrine, triglycerides, free fatty acids, glycerol, TSH, free thyroxine (fT4), free&#xD;
      triiodothyronine (fT3) fasting glucose, insulin and homeostasis model assessment (HOMA)&#xD;
      index, are measured at baseline and at the end of treatments.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial was part of a sub-project of a multicentre study named &quot;Interaction between&#xD;
      nutritional, social-behavioral and metabolic factors for prevention of cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease: development of nutritional strategies on general population&quot; approved by the Italian&#xD;
      Ministry of Health. The sub-project was specifically addressed to diet, thermogenesis and&#xD;
      obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Ephedrine and caffeine (EC) combination has been widely used in human obesity treatment,&#xD;
           and is still present in many herbal preparations sold widespread in many countries for&#xD;
           weight loss. It is well known that this drug increases the metabolic rate in both&#xD;
           animals and humans. Ephedrine is an agonist of both α and β-adrenoceptors; moreover, it&#xD;
           induces norepinephrine release from sympathetic neurons, and thus is a sympatho-mimetic&#xD;
           drug with a mixed profile. Caffeine increases both norepinephrine and dopamine release&#xD;
           and stimulates the neuronal activity in several brain regions. In addition, caffeine&#xD;
           antagonizes the inhibitory effects of adenosine on sympathetic nervous system (SNS).&#xD;
           This modulation of SNS activity may be a possible explanation for the thermic effect of&#xD;
           EC. In fact, epinephrine activates the uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), a member of&#xD;
           mitochondrial carriers localized on the inner mitochondrial membrane in brown&#xD;
           adipocytes. The physiological role of UCP1 is to uncouple oxidative phosphorylation,&#xD;
           therefore most of the energy is dissipated as heat rather than being converted to ATP.&#xD;
           UCP1 is unique to brown adipocyte mitochondria, although brown-like multilocular&#xD;
           adipocytes expressing UCP1 interspersed within human WAT have been observed. Actually,&#xD;
           UCP1 mRNA has been detected in all adipose tissues in adult humans, and it has been&#xD;
           estimated that 1 in 100-200 adipocytes in human intraperitoneal adipose tissue expresses&#xD;
           UCP1. It has been shown that the cold-induced occurrence of brown-like adipocytes and&#xD;
           UCP1 requires the presence of the β3-adrenoceptor in previously white adipose tissue and&#xD;
           the presence of the β3-adrenoceptor is required for full stimulation of energy&#xD;
           expenditure and oxygen consumption in white adipose tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In addition to UCP1, expressed exclusively in brown adipose tissue (BAT), another member&#xD;
           of the mitochondrial anion carrier protein family i.e. uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3) could&#xD;
           play a physiological role in energy homeostasis. It is expressed almost exclusively in&#xD;
           skeletal muscle and exhibits two transcriptional isoforms: a long form (UCP3L) and a&#xD;
           short form (UCP3S). A brief caloric restriction resulted in ~2- to 3-fold increase in&#xD;
           UCP3 mRNA levels in lean and obese humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Because only a few, small studies have been done in humans to investigate the&#xD;
           thermogenic effects of EC as compared to diet only, in the present study we examined the&#xD;
           UCP3 expression in skeletal muscle and the beta-3 adrenoceptor expression in adipose&#xD;
           tissue of pre-menopausal morbidly obese females treated with either placebo or EC for 30&#xD;
           days who subsequently underwent bariatric surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study subjects are adult females with morbid obesity i.e. body mass index ≥ 40 kg/m2&#xD;
           selected from the waiting list for bariatric surgery at Department of Surgery (Molinette&#xD;
           Hospital, Turin, Italy. During the treatment period all patients are fed a hypocaloric&#xD;
           diet (total energy content of ~70% of energy expenditure, as measured by indirect&#xD;
           calorimetry), and containing 20% proteins, 55% carbohydrates, 25% fat half of which was&#xD;
           monounsaturated, and 35 g/day fibres. Patients are randomised to 30-day treatment with&#xD;
           either EC (200/20mg t.i.d.) or placebo. They are hospitalised, during the whole&#xD;
           treatment period, at the metabolic unit of San Giuseppe Hospital-Istituto Auxologico&#xD;
           Italiano at Piancavallo (VB, Italy). The EC administration starts with an initial dose&#xD;
           of 100/10 mg t.i.d. for the first week and then proceeds with the full dose of 200/20 mg&#xD;
           t.i.d. Resting energy expenditure is measured by indirect calorimetry at baseline and at&#xD;
           the end of the study. The study pills (active compound and placebo) were prepared by the&#xD;
           Hospital's Pharmacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. In order to evaluate drug safety and effect on cardiac function, the blood pressure is&#xD;
           measured three times a day; both electrocardiography and echocardiography are being&#xD;
           recorded at baseline and every week. After diet and drug period, the patients are&#xD;
           transferred to the Department of Surgery (Molinette Hospital, Turin) for the bariatric&#xD;
           surgery. The drug treatment (EC and placebo) is stopped the day before surgical&#xD;
           intervention. Small biopsies of rectus abdominis and of subcutaneous and omental adipose&#xD;
           tissues are taken during surgery, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at&#xD;
           -80°C for subsequent analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. UCP3S and UCP3L mRNA levels are measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction at&#xD;
           the Department of Pharmacology, University of Milan. Presence of beta-3 adrenoceptor in&#xD;
           adipose tissue is evaluated by immunohistochemistry by the avidin-biotin peroxidase&#xD;
           technique using monoclonal anti-human beta 3-adrenoceptor antibody at the Department of&#xD;
           Human Anatomy, University of Ancona.&#xD;
