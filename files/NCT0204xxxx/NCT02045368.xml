  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I dose escalation study will evaluate IGF-Methotrexate conjugate (765IGF-MTX) in&#xD;
      patients with advanced, previously treated tumors. 765IGF-MTX is administered as an IV&#xD;
      infusion over 1 hour on days 1, 8 and 15 of a 28 day cycle. Treatment continues until disease&#xD;
      progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient refusal. Assessment of response will be&#xD;
      confirmed with imaging studies performed at the end of cycle 2 +/- 7 days, and every 2 weeks&#xD;
      thereafter.&#xD;
