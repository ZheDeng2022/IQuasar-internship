  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease is a childhood hip disorder which is common enough to be a&#xD;
      significant public health problem (affects 1 in 740 boys between ages 0-14), but uncommon&#xD;
      enough to have a sufficient number of patients from a single institution to perform a&#xD;
      definitive prospective study comparing the results of current treatments. The present study&#xD;
      will establish a database of prospectively identified patients with Legg-Calvé-Perthes (LCP)&#xD;
      Disease and collect information regarding their presentation, treatment, and outcomes in the&#xD;
      course of receiving currently available treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study seeks to compare the outcomes of current treatments in the management of different&#xD;
      age groups (ages 1-6, 6-8, 8-11, &gt;11) of patients with Perthes disease at two- and five-year&#xD;
      followup and at skeletal maturity. For each age group, two to three common treatment regimens&#xD;
      currently used by practicing pediatric orthopaedic surgeons will be compared. The&#xD;
      intervention a patient receives is determined through physician treatment expertise, and is&#xD;
      not pre-determined by the study.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 50 pediatric orthopaedic surgeons from pediatric centers in the US and other&#xD;
      countries have agreed to participate in this database as members of the International Perthes&#xD;
      Study Group (IPSG). TSRH will be the lead center. Sites who agree to participate will seek&#xD;
      IRB approval from their own institutions. Data will be collected prospectively and entered&#xD;
      into REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture), a browser-based research database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1-6 Cohort: For the 1-6 age patient group, patients involved in any treatment will be asked&#xD;
      to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6-8 Cohort: For the 6-8 age patient group, patients presenting in an early stage of the&#xD;
      disease (stage I or IIa), the surgeons who treat their patients with one of the following&#xD;
      three treatment regimens currently used in practice will be asked to participate in the study&#xD;
      :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Non-operative management (i.e., no osteotomy but can include soft tissue release);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Operative containment treatment (femoral or pelvic osteotomy or Shelf acetabuloplasty).&#xD;
&#xD;
      8-11 Cohort: For the 8-11 patient age group, patients presenting in an early stage of the&#xD;
      disease (stage I or IIa), the surgeons who treat their patients with one of the following&#xD;
      treatment regiments currently used in practice will be asked to participate in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Non-operative management (i.e., no osteotomy);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Operative containment treatment (femoral or pelvic osteotomy or Shelf acetabuloplasty)&#xD;
           followed by 6 weeks of postoperative non-weight bearing; and,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Operative containment treatment (femoral or pelvic osteotomy or Shelf acetabuloplasty)&#xD;
           followed by 6 months of postoperative non-weight bearing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &gt;11 Cohort Registry: For the &gt;11 patient age group, we will collect prospective data from&#xD;
      surgeons who are currently treating their patients with any treatment regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who present to an IPSG member or their group during the late stages of the disease&#xD;
      (stage IIb or stage III) will also be arranged into four separate age cohorts, identical to&#xD;
      the list above. We will collect prospective data for these cases, as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regardless of the patient's stage at enrollment, the patient's age at diagnosis or assigned&#xD;
      cohort, the following data will be collected: information regarding patient characteristics&#xD;
      at presentation, physical exam findings, responses to Perthes patient and/or outcomes&#xD;
      questionnaires, and results of radiographic and MR imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be assigned a unique study number. A secure web application, REDCap, will&#xD;
      be used to capture and store research information including radiographic and MR images,&#xD;
      clinical information, and de-identified outcomes questionnaire responses. Data will be&#xD;
      transmitted and stored on a secure and dedicated server for the purpose of this study.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Sphericity deviation score of the femoral head</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome for each age group will be a quantitative estimate of the sphericity of the femoral head as a measure of femoral head deformity. A more deformed head will be less spherical. Greater deformity leads to an increased risk of arthritis early in life.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Perfusion percentage</measure>
    <time_frame>Just after diagnosis of Perthes disease</time_frame>
    <description>The perfusion percentage is a measure of the amount of blood flow in the femoral head relative to the volume of the whole head. This measure is calculated from the perfusion MRI images that are collected just prior to the application of the intervention.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Stulberg classification</measure>
    <time_frame>at 2 years and 5 years post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Stulberg classification is a categorical system used to describe the shape of the femoral head that is traditionally used to evaluate outcomes and arthritis risk for patients with Perthes disease.</description>

    <description>Patients presenting over age 11 may receive multiple drilling and be non weight bearing for up to 6 months according to the treating physician's preference. Patients with application of fixator (arthrodiastasis) will be studied in this cohort arm as well, which typically involved 3-4 months followed by 8-12 weeks of non-weight bearing after fixator removal. Other surgical techniques may be included, however these are the most common for this age group.</description>
