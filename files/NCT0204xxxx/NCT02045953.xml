  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The VENTOLIN Mini-Spacer is being developed in order to support patients in the Emerging&#xD;
      Markets and Asia Pacific regions who do not have access to affordable spacers. The aim of&#xD;
      this exploratory study is to investigate whether the systemic exposure for fluticasone&#xD;
      propionate (FP) and salmeterol observed with the VENTOLIN Mini-Spacer is comparable to the&#xD;
      systemic exposure for FP and salmeterol observed with the Trudell Aerochamber Plus spacer for&#xD;
      both FLIXOTIDE and SERETIDE Metered Dose Inhaler (MDI) products. There will be four study&#xD;
      periods in the study and all participants will receive four study treatments during the&#xD;
      study. The total duration of study including screening, treatment period, washout period, and&#xD;
      follow-up period will be 58 days. Study is planned to enroll 20 healthy subjects.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female subjects between 18 and 65 years of age inclusive, at the time of&#xD;
             signing the informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical&#xD;
             evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and&#xD;
             cardiac testing. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameter(s)&#xD;
             which is/are not specifically listed in the inclusion or exclusion criteria, outside&#xD;
             the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if the&#xD;
             Investigator agree and document that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional&#xD;
             risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body weight &gt;=50 kilogram (kg) and body mass index within the range 19 - 34 kg/meter^2&#xD;
             (inclusive).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Non-childbearing potential defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented&#xD;
        hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy or bilateral salpingectomy [for this definition,&#xD;
        &quot;documented&quot; refers to the outcome of the investigator's/designee's review of the subject's&#xD;
        medical history for study eligibility, as obtained via a verbal interview with the subject&#xD;
        or from the subject's medical records]; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of&#xD;
        spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle&#xD;
        stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 21.7 international unit/Liter (L) and estradiol &lt;110&#xD;
        picomoles/L is confirmatory]. [Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose&#xD;
        menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception methods if&#xD;
        they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to&#xD;
        allow confirmation of post-menopausal status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of&#xD;
        HRT, at least 2-4 weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw;&#xD;
        this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their&#xD;
        post-menopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a&#xD;
        contraceptive method.] Child-bearing potential with negative pregnancy test as determined&#xD;
        by urine or serum human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) test at screening or prior to dosing&#xD;

        determined by the product label or investigator) prior to the start of dosing to&#xD;

        use contraception until 2 days post-last dose.&#xD;

             normal (ULN) (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated&#xD;
             and direct bilirubin &lt;35%).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Based on single or averaged QT duration corrected for heart rate by Fridericia's&#xD;
             formula (QTcF) values of single electrocardiograms (ECGs) obtained over a brief&#xD;

             average weekly intake of &gt;21 units for males or &gt;14 units for females. One unit is&#xD;
             equivalent to 8 grams of alcohol: a half-pint (approximately 240 milliliter [mL]) of&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a&#xD;
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK&#xD;
             Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation.&#xD;
