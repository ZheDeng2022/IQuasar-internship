      This is a Phase II multi-center exploratory study to identify biomarkers predictive of&#xD;
      clinical response to aflibercept in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who have&#xD;
      failed first-line therapy, consisting of an oxaliplatin-containing regimen in combination&#xD;
      with bevacizumab. Patients will consent to a needle core biopsy of a liver metastatic lesion&#xD;
      prior to starting treatment. This study will be open primarily at sites conducting the&#xD;
      Q-CROC-01 study (NCT00984048), in which colorectal cancer patients receiving standard&#xD;
      first-line treatment undergo a biopsy of a liver metastatic lesion before treatment and at&#xD;
      resistance. The post-first-line treatment biopsy will be used as the pre-treatment biopsy for&#xD;
      this trial. For patients not participating in the Q-CROC-01 study, patients will be required&#xD;
      to undergo a liver needle core biopsy of a metastatic lesion before study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biopsies and blood samples will be collected from all study patients. An exploratory&#xD;
      pharmacoeconomic analysis will be performed to evaluate productivity loss, quality of life&#xD;
      and resource utilization while on treatment with aflibercept.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 52 patients will be enrolled, primarily at centers participating in the Q-CROC-01&#xD;
      study. The trial will close enrolment when 42 evaluable pre-treatment tumor biopsy samples&#xD;
      have been obtained. Accrual of the total patient population is estimated to take 24-36 months&#xD;
      with the estimated start date being February 2014.&#xD;

    <description>A biopsy from a liver metastasis will be taken at baseline for discovery of biomarkers that correlate with response to aflibercept. Genomic material (DNA and RNA) will be isolated from all biopsies. Batched analysis will be performed at the end of the study with the evaluable samples for multiplex biomarker discovery. Patient's biomarker status at baseline will be correlated with treatment effect on PFS and response (including response rate and disease control rate) to explore which biological targets may be particularly important in defining the appropriate treatment population for aflibercept.</description>

    <description>Aflibercept (Sanofi and Regeneron) targets the Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway that is a composite decoy receptor based on VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 fused to an Fc segment of IgG1. In pre-clinical assessments, aflibercept results in stronger angiogenesis inhibition than bevacizumab, exhibiting at least 100-1000 times higher affinity to the circulating VEGFs. It is postulated that in vivo, the binding of these ligands to aflibercept results in the blockade of tumor angiogenesis along with pruning of existing tumor vascular elements and reduction of VEGF-driven vascular permeability. The expected outcome is reduced growth of primary and metastatic tumors by impeding the density of tumor vasculature and diminishing the abnormal leakiness of tumor vessels that supply matrix components to the cancer.</description>
