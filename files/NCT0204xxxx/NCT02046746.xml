      This study is an unblinded, prospective, multicenter, single arm study in Taiwan. Eligible&#xD;
      subjects (see inclusion and exclusion criteria in Section 5.2) will receive standard of care&#xD;
      (which includes dietary counseling) and ONS supplementation (1-2 servings/day depending on&#xD;
      subject's needs) for 24 weeks (6 months). A follow up visit (phone call/medical chart review)&#xD;
      will occur 12 months after the study intervention has ended to collect mortality data, to&#xD;
      determine whether or not dialysis was initiated, and if ONS use continued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be informed of the study results when available. Subjects may continue use of&#xD;
      the commercially available study product if it is recommended by their nephrologist, primary&#xD;
      care physician, dietitian, or if the subject chooses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study enrollment is defined as when the subject is stratified and begins to consume&#xD;
      the study product (Study Visit 1, Month 0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The target population described above may be stratified into the following groups (n=18&#xD;
      evaluable/group):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Male CKD Stage 3b-5 without T2DM&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Male CKD Stage 3b-5 with T2DM&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Female CKD Stage 3b-5 without T2DM&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Female CKD Stage 3b-5 with T2DM&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, for those subjects enrolled, retrospective data (previous 6 to 12 months)&#xD;
      identical to the study variables will be collected. Retrospective data collection will focus&#xD;
      on the following measures, however, all data points are not expected to be available:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serum albumin&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SGA&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compliance to protein intake guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compliance to energy intake guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hand grip strength&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anthropometrics (weight, height, BMI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of Life (WHOQOL-BREF Taiwan Version)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  eGFR (whichever equation is used as standard of care)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serum creatinine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proteinuria (retrospective - if available on medical records)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BUN&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Body composition data from BIA (especially fat mass and muscle mass, units or exact&#xD;
           terminology will be model specific)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  C reactive protein (CRP)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood chemistries,&#xD;
