    <textblock>
      Hemodynamic management of critically ill patients is a constant challenge in the intensive&#xD;
      care unit (ICU). Commonly used monitoring parameters to guide hemodynamic management&#xD;
      generally consist of measurements of pressures (systemic and pulmonary artery pressures,&#xD;
      cardiac filling pressures) and flow (cardiac output measurements using a thermodilution&#xD;
      method). However, cardiac filling pressures and flow data have known limitations and might&#xD;
      not accurately represent cardiac preload and contractility. Hemodynamic management of&#xD;
      critically ill patients based on these parameters might therefore not be optimal and delay&#xD;
      stabilisation of the patient, leading to negative outcomes and increased use of resources.&#xD;

      Visualization of the heart using echocardiography offers the advantage of direct measurement&#xD;

      evaluate the causes of hemodynamic instability in ICU patients by the visualization of&#xD;
      cardiac chambers, valves and pericardium and cardiac functional abnormalities. A repeated&#xD;
      echocardiographic assessment could potentially provide useful additional information&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemodynamic management of critically ill patients is a constant challenge in the intensive&#xD;
      care unit (ICU). Commonly used monitoring parameters to guide hemodynamic management&#xD;
      generally consist of measurements of pressures (systemic and pulmonary artery pressures,&#xD;
      cardiac filling pressures) and flow (cardiac output measurements using a thermodilution&#xD;
      method). However, cardiac filling pressures and flow data have known limitations and might&#xD;
      not accurately represent cardiac preload and contractility. To date, continuous or sequential&#xD;
      recording of hemodynamic parameters is limited to pulse pressure variation measurement and&#xD;
      indicator dilution techniques. The overall accuracy of these methods is not well established&#xD;
      and comparisons of measurements of cardiac function parameters have been reported to trend&#xD;
      differently in response to therapy and show limited interdevice agreement. Hemodynamic&#xD;
      management of critically ill patients based on these parameters might therefore not be&#xD;
      optimal and delay stabilisation of the patient, leading to negative outcomes and increased&#xD;
      use of resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visualization of the heart using echocardiography offers the advantage of direct measurement&#xD;
      of cardiac volumes and systolic function. Echocardiography has been established as a tool to&#xD;
      evaluate the causes of hemodynamic instability in ICU patients by the visualization of&#xD;
      cardiac chambers, valves and pericardium and cardiac functional abnormalities. Transthoracic&#xD;
      echocardiography (TTE) can be used as a first-line approach for a quick and focused&#xD;
      examination to diagnose acute cor pulmonale, cardiac tamponade or major left ventricular&#xD;
      systolic dysfunction. The training necessary to reliably perform such an abbreviated TTE use&#xD;
      is substantial and the method is not readily available for every intensivist. Transesophageal&#xD;
      echocardiography (TEE) can have a better diagnostic capability and is more reproducible than&#xD;
      TTE. A minimum number of 31 TEE examinations has been reported to be required for&#xD;
      intensivists to achieve competence in TEE driven hemodynamic evaluation of ventilated ICU&#xD;
      patients. Additionally, repeatedly inserting the TEE probe as required for serial evaluation&#xD;
      of a patients hemodynamic status is associated with a small but significant risk of injury to&#xD;
      oral and esophageal structures. A repeated echocardiographic assessment could potentially&#xD;
      provide useful additional information resulting in more rapid resolution of hemodynamic&#xD;
      instability. Using conventional TTE and TEE, however, limits the feasibility of such an&#xD;
      approach due to a lack of time and availability of appropriately trained staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a recently published study the feasibility of hemodynamic monitoring and safety of hTEE&#xD;
      was demonstrated in a group of ninety-four ventilated critically ill patients. In this study&#xD;
      hTEE examinations were performed by four highly trained intensivist with extensive expertise&#xD;
      in critically care echocardiography. The Department of Intensive Care Medicine Inselspital&#xD;
      (KIM) has introduced hTEE in January 2012. The feasibility and quality of hemodynamic&#xD;
      monitoring using hTEE by the department's intensivists was assessed in the context of a&#xD;
      prospective quality review assessment. The study showed that the echocardiographic&#xD;
      examinations using hTEE were of sufficient quality in a majority of examined ICU patients and&#xD;
      that the inter-rater reliability between the intensivists and a trained cardiologist was&#xD;
      substantial. However, as of yet studies assessing the impact of hemodynamic monitoring by&#xD;
      hTEE on relevant patient outcomes are not available. Given the associated costs for the hTEE&#xD;
      device and the ultrasound probes and the additional resource requirements for training and&#xD;
      application, the efficacy and efficiency of hTEE monitoring in comparison to standard&#xD;
      monitoring should be established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigated device consists of a newly developed, commercially available transesophageal&#xD;
      echocardiography system. The ImaCor ClariTEE technology (hTEE) device produces a single-plane&#xD;
      two-dimensional image and has color Doppler capability (IMACOR, New-York NY, USA). The ImaCor&#xD;
      probe is a 5.5 mm detachable probe; due to its small size it can remain in situ for up to 72h&#xD;
      and therefore allows for reassessment of the patient's hemodynamic progress and the effect of&#xD;
      selected interventions at any time. The probe has to be disposed after 72h for hygienic&#xD;
      reasons. The probe is connected to a dedicated echocardiographic system which allows the&#xD;
      recording of digital loops and performance of basic two-dimensional measurements of areas and&#xD;
      distances. It provides a robust, but more rapid and user-friendly approach to monitoring&#xD;
      hemodynamic status and cardiac function than conventional TTE/TEE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesis is that hemodynamic monitoring using hTEE of critically ill patients&#xD;
      with hemodynamic compromise allows for an expedited reversal of circulatory impairment&#xD;
      compared to standard ICU monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: To assess the impact of hemodynamic monitoring using the ImaCor ClariTEE&#xD;
      technology on duration and amount of vasopressor use and time to reversal of shock in&#xD;
      hemodynamically compromised patients in comparison to standard monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective: To assess the safety and tolerability of the ImaCor ClariTEE probe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be assigned to one of four groups stratified by method of hemodynamic&#xD;
      monitoring (ImaCor vs control hemodynamic monitoring) and frequency of hemodynamic&#xD;
      assessments (protocolized intervals PM vs standard monitoring intervals SM). In patients&#xD;
      randomized to echocardiography-guided hemodynamic management (ImaCorPM and ImaCorSM) the&#xD;
      ImaCor ClariTEE system will be installed at the time of study inclusion. An ICU consultant&#xD;
      will assess the patients' hemodynamic condition based on the hTEE information (ImaCorPM and&#xD;
      SM) and other available hemodynamic parameters (ControlPM and SM). Any changes in hemodynamic&#xD;
      management are recorded.&#xD;
