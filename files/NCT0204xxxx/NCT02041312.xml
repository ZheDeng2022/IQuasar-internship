      Investigators have a plan to conduct nested case-control study to investigate the association&#xD;
      between serum cholesterol levels including TC, HDL-C, LDL-C, triglyceride (TG),&#xD;
      apolipoproteins and gastric neoplasm. In addition, further analyses were performed to&#xD;
      evaluate the possible role of the serum cholesterol as a predictor for the differentiation&#xD;
      and prognosis of gastric neoplasm.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Although its incidence has declined, gastric cancer remains one of the most common causes of&#xD;
      cancer morbidity and mortality worldwide.Since the stage of gastric cancer at the time of&#xD;
      detection correlates with prognosis, secondary prevention is important. Screening of&#xD;
      asymptomatic individuals for gastric cancer has been shown to increase the detection of early&#xD;
      gastric cancer (EGC), which has a 5-year overall survival (OS) rate exceeding 90%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gastric carcinogenesis is a multi-factorial process that includes environmental,&#xD;
      socioeconomic, and lifestyle factors. Many of risk factors, including dietary factors,&#xD;
      chronic atrophic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia, and H. pylori infection, alcohol&#xD;
      consumption, and aspirin have been investigated. Although the specific correlation between&#xD;
      serum cholesterol and gastric cancer is not fully understood, inverse relationships have been&#xD;
      observed between serum total cholesterol (TC) levels and cancer, and recent analyses of&#xD;
      randomized controlled trials showed significant inverse associations between high density&#xD;
      lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and the risk&#xD;
      of incident cancers. Lower lipoprotein cholesterol in cancer patients may be due to the&#xD;
      enhanced activity of the lipoprotein cholesterol receptor pathway and to the increased demand&#xD;
      for cholesterol during tumor development and lymphatic spread. Some suggested that the&#xD;
      preexisting tumor might have resulted in low serum cholesterol, which is called &quot;preclinical&#xD;
      cancer effect&quot; or &quot;unsuspected sickness&quot;. In another study, LDL-C has been reported to affect&#xD;
      host immune system cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our previous study, investigators found that serum HDL-C and LDL-C levels were associated&#xD;
      with the risk, resectability, and prognosis of gastric cancer. There are several cohort&#xD;
      studies reported that low serum cholesterol levels are associated with incident cancer,&#xD;
      including gastric cancer. However, most studies regarding the serum cholesterol and gastric&#xD;
      cancer investigated gastrectomized patients, and showed the association between low serum&#xD;
      cholesterol levels and lymph node metastasis or submucosal invasion. Furthermore, there are&#xD;
      only few studies evaluated the association between LDL-C of apolipoproteins and gastric&#xD;
      cancer. Therefore investigators conducted nested case-control study to investigate the&#xD;
      association between serum cholesterol levels including TC, HDL-C, LDL-C, triglyceride (TG),&#xD;
      apolipoproteins and gastric neoplasm. In addition, further analyses were performed to&#xD;
      evaluate the possible role of the serum cholesterol as a predictor for the differentiation&#xD;
      and prognosis of gastric neoplasm.&#xD;
