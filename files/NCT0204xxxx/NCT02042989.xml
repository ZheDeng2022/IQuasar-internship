      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of the&#xD;
      combination of MLN9708 and vorinostat that can be given to patients with advanced solid&#xD;
      tumors. The safety of these drugs will also be studied.&#xD;

      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a dose&#xD;
      level of MLN9708 and vorinostat based on when you join this study. Up to 4 dose levels of the&#xD;
      MLN9708 and vorinostat combination will be tested. Up to 6 participants will be enrolled at&#xD;
      each dose level combination. The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose&#xD;
      level combination. Each new group will receive a higher dose of either MLN9708 or vorinostat&#xD;
      than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. This will continue until&#xD;
      the highest tolerable dose combination of MLN9708 and vorinostat is found or all 4 dose&#xD;
      levels are filled. Up to an additional 14 participants will be enrolled in the highest dose&#xD;
      level of the study drug combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose of the study drug combination that you receive may be lowered if you have&#xD;
      intolerable side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each study cycle is 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will take MLN9708 capsules by mouth every 7 days (on Days 1, 8, and 15 of every cycle).&#xD;
      You should swallow MLN9708 capsules whole with 8 ounces (1 cup) of water. Each capsule should&#xD;
      be swallowed separately with a sip of water. Do not break, chew, or open the capsules. Each&#xD;
      dose should be taken on an empty stomach, at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal. If&#xD;
      you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, as long as the next scheduled dose is at&#xD;
      least 72 hours (3 days) away. You should not take a double dose to make up for a missed dose.&#xD;
      If you vomit after taking a dose, wait until the next scheduled dose. Do not take an&#xD;
      additional dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will take vorinostat capsules by mouth on Days 1-21 of each cycle, followed by a break of&#xD;
      7 days. You should swallow vorinostat capsules whole with water. Do not break, chew, or open&#xD;
      the capsules. Vorinostat should be taken with food. If you miss a dose, take it as soon as&#xD;
      you remember, as long as the next scheduled dose is at least 12 hours away. You should not&#xD;
      take a double dose to make up for a missed dose. If you vomit after taking a dose, wait until&#xD;
      the next scheduled dose. Do not take an additional dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is important that you tell your doctor if you have any side effects while on this study.&#xD;
      If you have side effects or abnormal test results, you may be asked to return to the clinic&#xD;
      for more tests until the side effects or abnormal test results improve. Your dose of study&#xD;
      drug may be changed and/or you may be given drugs to help control the side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      One (1) time each week during Cycle 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ° Blood (about 6 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check your liver and&#xD;
      kidney function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Cycles 2 and beyond:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 6 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If your doctor thinks it is needed, urine will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of Cycles 2 and beyond:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a CT, PET, and/or MRI scan to check the status of the disease. If your&#xD;
           doctor thinks it is needed, you may have measurement sooner.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the study doctor thinks it is needed, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to&#xD;
           measure tumor markers. Tumor markers can be used to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any time the doctor thinks it is needed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 6 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you can become pregnant, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be collected for a pregnancy&#xD;
           test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an EKG to check your heart function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may continue taking the study drugs for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best&#xD;
      interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if&#xD;
      intolerable side effects occur, if you develop new health problems, or if you are no longer&#xD;
      able to follow study directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may choose to stop taking the study drugs at any time. You should tell the study doctor&#xD;
      right away if you are thinking about no longer taking part in this study. The study doctor&#xD;
      will talk to you about how to safely stop taking the study drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation on the study will be over after the end-of-study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of Study Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 30 days after your last dose of the study drugs, the following tests and procedures&#xD;
      will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 7 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests, tests of your kidney and&#xD;
           liver function, and tumor marker testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a CT, PET, and/or MRI scan to check the status of the disease. If your&#xD;
           doctor thinks it is needed, you may have a scan performed sooner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. MLN9708 is not FDA approved or commercially available.&#xD;
      MLN9708 is currently being used for research purposes only. Vorinostat is FDA approved and&#xD;
      commercially available to treat advanced cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 56 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
