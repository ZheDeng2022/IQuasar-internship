  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical research study of an investigational (FDA IND-BB 10091) treatment for&#xD;
      patients with advanced colorectal cancer that no longer responds to standard therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment is being evaluated for its effect on tumor growth. It consists of the placement&#xD;
      (implantation) of small beads that contain mouse renal adenocarcinoma cells (RENCA&#xD;
      macrobeads). The cells in the macrobeads produce substances that have been shown to slow or&#xD;
      stop the growth of tumors in experimental animals and veterinary patients. It has been tested&#xD;
      in 31 human subjects with different types of cancers in a Phase I safety trial. Phase II&#xD;
      studies in patients with colorectal, pancreatic or prostate cancers are in progress&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase IIb, multicenter, nonrandomized, open-label study with RENCA macrobeads in&#xD;
      patients with treatment-resistant, metastatic colorectal carcinoma to determine the effect of&#xD;
      RENCA macrobead implantation on overall survival compared with best supportive care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two treatment groups will be enrolled in this study, as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group A (n=40) - patients who will undergo up to 4 implantations of RENCA macrobeads (no&#xD;
           less than 3 months apart), at a dosage level of 8 RENCA macrobeads per kilogram of body&#xD;
           weight&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group B (n=80) - patients who had previously decided (independently of this study) to&#xD;
           receive, or continue receiving, best supportive care, defined as management of symptoms&#xD;
           aimed at maintaining or improving quality of life, but not including approved therapies&#xD;
           targeting the patient's malignancy&#xD;

    <description>The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance scale is a 5-point scale, where 0 denotes perfect health and 5 is death. It is used by clinicians to assess disease progression and how the disease is affecting the daily living abilities of the patient. The ECOG Performance Status scores are defined as follows:&#xD;
0: Fully active, able to carry on all pre-disease activities without restriction.&#xD;
1: Restricted in physical strenuous activity, but ambulatory and able to carry out work of a light or sedentary nature (e.g. light house work, office work).&#xD;
2: Ambulatory and capable of all self-care, but unable to carry out any work activities, up and about more than 50% of waking hours.&#xD;
3: Capable of only limited self-care, confined to bed or chair 50% or more of waking hours.&#xD;
4: Completely disabled, cannot carry on any self-care, totally confined to bed or chair.&#xD;
5: Death</description>

    <description>Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) is a self-rated scale that measures the participant's ability to perform daily functions, ranging from 0 (&quot;dead&quot;) to 100 (&quot;normal, no complaints, no evidence of disease). Karnofsky scores are defined as follows:&#xD;
100: Normal; no complaints; no evidence of disease&#xD;
90: Able to carry on normal activity with effort, minor sign or symptoms of disease&#xD;
80: Normal activity with effort; some sign or symptoms of disease&#xD;
70: Cares for self; unable to carry on normal activity or do active work&#xD;
60: Requires occasional assistance, but is able to care for most personal needs&#xD;
50: Requires considerable assistance and frequent medical care&#xD;
40: Disabled; requires special care and assistance&#xD;
30: Severely disabled; hospitalization is indicated, although death is not imminent&#xD;
20: Very sick; hospitalization/active support treatment is necessary&#xD;

    <description>The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30, version 3.0) consists of 30 questions which pertain to: five functional scales, three symptom scales, a global health status score, and six single items.&#xD;
The Global Health Status is assessed from 2 of the 30 questions (Question 29 and 30), whose response score ranges on a 7 point scale. The score for physical function is calculated based on the average score from these 2 questions. A linear transformation is used to standardize these responses. Using this linear transformation, the minimum value is 0 (worst outcome, poor) and the maximum value is 100 (best outcome, excellent). Therefore, increasing values indicate better outcome and decreasing values indicate worse outcome.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Necrosis Comparison of Tumors Using PET-CT Scan</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 90 post-Implant 1</time_frame>
    <description>Tumors were assessed by positron emission tomography (PET)-CT scan at baseline and day 90 following the first RENCA macrobead implantation. The use of [13]F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake for the detection of lesions &gt;1 cm in diameter allowed evaluation of metabolic activity. Decreases in FDG uptake were indicative of metabolic suppression of the tumor. The use of PET-CT scanning indicated anatomical localization, approximate size/volume of primary tumor and metastatic lesion(s), and assessment of metabolic activity of the tumor (as an indicator of metabolic health and necrosis).&#xD;
Disease state is reported as a function of Tumor measurement divided by SUVmax. Changes were assessed between day 90 post RENCA macrobead implant and baseline values. Patients with no change = stable; patients with decreased values = decreased/necrosis, and patients with increased values = increased.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Participants were recruited based on physician referral at five academic medical centers between March 2013 and November 2017. The first participant was implanted on April 11, 2014 and the last implant was March 7, 2018.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>70 participants provided informed consent to participate in the study (Group A n=67; Group B n=3). Of these, 41 mCRC patients were enrolled in the RENCA macrobead implantation arm (Group A) and 3 subjects were enrolled in the Best Supportive Care arm (Group B). The 25 subjects who were not enrolled into Group A, after providing informed consent, had failed the respective eligibility criteria.</pre_assignment_details>

      <population>The analysis population was limited to those in Group A, Macrobead Implantation Arm. Group B, Best Supportive Care, was only able to enroll 3 of 80 participants planned. Per Group B investigators, the entry criteria were flagged as being impossible for reliable enrollment.

        <description>The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance scale is a 5-point scale, where 0 denotes perfect health and 5 is death. It is used by clinicians to assess disease progression and how the disease is affecting the daily living abilities of the patient. The ECOG Performance Status scores are defined as follows:&#xD;
0: Fully active, able to carry on all pre-disease activities without restriction.&#xD;
1: Restricted in physical strenuous activity, but ambulatory and able to carry out work of a light or sedentary nature (e.g. light house work, office work).&#xD;
2: Ambulatory and capable of all self-care, but unable to carry out any work activities, up and about more than 50% of waking hours.&#xD;
3: Capable of only limited self-care, confined to bed or chair 50% or more of waking hours.&#xD;
4: Completely disabled, cannot carry on any self-care, totally confined to bed or chair.&#xD;

        <description>Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) is a self-rated scale that measures the participant's ability to perform daily functions, ranging from 0 (&quot;dead&quot;) to 100 (&quot;normal, no complaints, no evidence of disease). Karnofsky scores are defined as follows:&#xD;
100: Normal; no complaints; no evidence of disease&#xD;
90: Able to carry on normal activity with effort, minor sign or symptoms of disease&#xD;
80: Normal activity with effort; some sign or symptoms of disease&#xD;
70: Cares for self; unable to carry on normal activity or do active work&#xD;
60: Requires occasional assistance, but is able to care for most personal needs&#xD;
50: Requires considerable assistance and frequent medical care&#xD;
40: Disabled; requires special care and assistance&#xD;
30: Severely disabled; hospitalization is indicated, although death is not imminent&#xD;
20: Very sick; hospitalization/active support treatment is necessary&#xD;
10: Moribund; fatal processes progressively worsening&#xD;

        <title>Global Health Status</title>
        <description>The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30, version 3.0) consists of 30 questions which pertain to: five functional scales, three symptom scales, a global health status score, and six single items.&#xD;
The Global Health Status is assessed from 2 of the 30 questions (Question 29 and 30), whose response score ranges on a 7 point scale. The score for physical function is calculated based on the average score from these 2 questions. A linear transformation is used to standardize these responses. Using this linear transformation, the minimum value is 0 (worst outcome, poor) and the maximum value is 100 (best outcome, excellent). Therefore, increasing values indicate better outcome and decreasing values indicate worse outcome.</description>

        <description>TThe European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30, version 3.0) consists of 30 questions which pertain to: five functional scales (including physical function), three symptom scales, a global health status score, and six single items.&#xD;
Physical Function is assessed from 5 of the 30 questions (Questions 1-5), whose response score ranges on a 4 point scale. The score for physical function is calculated based on the average score from these 5 questions. A linear transformation is used to standardize these responses. Using this linear transformation, the minimum value is 0 (worst outcome, poor functionality) and the maximum value is 100 (best outcome, better functionality). Therefore, increasing values indicate better outcome and decreasing values indicate worse outcome.</description>

          <title>Cognitive Function</title>
          <description>The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30, version 3.0) consists of 30 questions which pertain to: five functional scales (including cognitive function), three symptom scales, a global health status score, and six single items.&#xD;
Cognitive Function is assessed from 2 of the 30 questions (Question 20 and 25), whose response score ranges on a 4 point scale. The score for role function is calculated based on the average score from these 2 questions. A linear transformation is used to standardize these responses. Using this linear transformation, the minimum value is 0 (worst outcome, poor functionality) and the maximum value is 100 (best outcome, better functionality). Therefore, increasing values indicate better outcome and decreasing values indicate worse outcome.</description>

        <title>Necrosis Comparison of Tumors Using PET-CT Scan</title>
        <description>Tumors were assessed by positron emission tomography (PET)-CT scan at baseline and day 90 following the first RENCA macrobead implantation. The use of [13]F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake for the detection of lesions &gt;1 cm in diameter allowed evaluation of metabolic activity. Decreases in FDG uptake were indicative of metabolic suppression of the tumor. The use of PET-CT scanning indicated anatomical localization, approximate size/volume of primary tumor and metastatic lesion(s), and assessment of metabolic activity of the tumor (as an indicator of metabolic health and necrosis).&#xD;
Disease state is reported as a function of Tumor measurement divided by SUVmax. Changes were assessed between day 90 post RENCA macrobead implant and baseline values. Patients with no change = stable; patients with decreased values = decreased/necrosis, and patients with increased values = increased.</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>Group B was only able to enroll 3/80 participants planned for the best supportive care management arm of this study. As per Group B investigators, the entry criteria were flagged as being impossible for reliable enrollment. Therefore, the results reported here focus on the Group A participants, those which were implanted with RENCA macrobeads.</limitations_and_caveats>
