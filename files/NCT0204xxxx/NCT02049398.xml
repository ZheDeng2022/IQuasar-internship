      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Normal bacteria and other tiny organisms are found in healthy human mouths. These are&#xD;
      called oral microbiota. It is unclear exactly how the oral microbiota may affect health. For&#xD;
      example, if the microbial composition is abnormal, it may lead to mouth conditions like&#xD;
      periodontitis. Researchers want to study how the microbiota changes over time. This can help&#xD;
      them plan future disease studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To see if and how oral microbiota change over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Forty adult employees of the National Cancer Institute Shady Grove.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For 12 hours before the first visit, participants will not eat or drink (except water).&#xD;
           They will not brush, floss, use mouthwash, chew gum, eat lozenges or candies, smoke&#xD;
           cigarettes, or chew tobacco.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the first visit, participants will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Be given a saliva collector. They will spit 2 mL of saliva into it.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fill out an online questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Every 2 months, participants will visit the clinic and repeat visit 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study ends after 1 year.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The Human Microbiome Project (HMP), started in 2008, aimed to characterize the microbial&#xD;
      communities on the skin, in the oral and nasal cavities, and in the gastrointestinal and&#xD;
      urogenital tracts. This project cross-sectionally described the microbial communities in a&#xD;
      healthy human population, but did not adequately describe longitudinal stability. Out of the&#xD;
      236 adults included in the HMP, a second saliva sample was collected on a small subset (N=74)&#xD;
      with a long interval between collections, an average of 203 days. Community similarity was&#xD;
      calculated between two visits; for saliva samples, the Spearman correlation was high&#xD;
      (rs=0.8). However, it was unclear which metric of community similarly was being used for this&#xD;
      calculation. When we obtained the HMP data and calculated the Spearman correlation for&#xD;
      specific diversity metrics in the saliva samples, the correlations were weaker and ranged&#xD;
      from 0.225 to 0.524 for the Shannon Index and PD tree, respectively. Other studies with fewer&#xD;
      people, but more time points, have had conflicting conclusions on the temporal variation of&#xD;
      the oral microbiome. Given this variability, it is vital to establish whether a single&#xD;
      measurement is representative of the typical composition of microbiota in a specific body&#xD;
      site using more than two time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In epidemiological studies, it is often impractical, if not impossible, to collect biological&#xD;
      samples or measurements multiple times for each participant during the study period. However,&#xD;
      when a biological sample or a measurement is taken only once, there is concern that the&#xD;
      single assessment is not representative of the typical value. For example, serum 25(OH)D&#xD;
      levels, which are used to assess an individual s vitamin D exposure, have seasonal&#xD;
      fluctuations, but studies have established that a single measurement is sufficiently reliable&#xD;
      to represent typical exposure. The correlation between samples over time is also used to&#xD;
      create more accurate power calculations for future studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since previous work has not adequately addressed temporal variation in the oral microbiome,&#xD;
      we propose to: 1) establish a cohort of 40 adults willing to provide oral samples&#xD;
      approximately every two months for one year; 2) process all oral samples and evaluate the&#xD;
      presence and quantity of microbiota using 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing; 3) calculate&#xD;
      appropriate reliability measures for the sample over time using the intra-class correlation&#xD;
      coefficient (ICC) for and &lt;= diversity metrics; and 4) empirically evaluate the efficiency of&#xD;
      different longitudinal designs including two or more sample collections with an outcome such&#xD;
      as body mass index (BMI). Because of the complexity and high prevalence of human DNA in&#xD;
      saliva, metagenomic analyses of oral samples are not yet feasible, however, the samples&#xD;
      obtained from this study will be available for use in future metagenomic analyses when the&#xD;
      technology is operationalized. The current study is essential to establish the reliability of&#xD;
      a single measure of the oral microbiome to determine appropriate sample sizes for future&#xD;
      cohort studies considering the effect of the oral microbiome on the risk of cancer and other&#xD;
      health outcomes.&#xD;
