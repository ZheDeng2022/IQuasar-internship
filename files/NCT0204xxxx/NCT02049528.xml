  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is being conducted to compare how long 2 oral formulations (a reference and a test&#xD;
      formulation) of CC-122 stays in the body, and whether taking the test formulations with a&#xD;
      high-fat meal affects the absorption of that formulation. There will be 3 dosing periods in&#xD;
      the study, one for each formulation and one for the test formulation + meal. The subjects&#xD;
      will be asked to fast for at least 10 hours before taking the capsule formulations. During&#xD;
      one of the periods, the subject will be asked to eat a high-fat meal 30 minutes before being&#xD;
      given the capsule to swallow. Subjects will be randomly (by chance) assigned to a treatment&#xD;
      sequence which will determine the order in which the subject will receive the reference&#xD;
      formulation, the test formulation, and the test formulation + high-fat meal. Blood samples&#xD;
      will be taken at intervals during the study to assess the amount of drug at those time&#xD;
      points. Blood samples will also be collected at certain time points to determine the levels&#xD;
      of special proteins that may help explain how CC-122 work.&#xD;

                  the first dose administration, or 5 half-lives of that investigational drug, if&#xD;
                  known (whichever is longer).&#xD;
&#xD;
              12. Smoke more than 10 cigarettes per day, or the equivalent in other tobacco&#xD;

                  fever), excluding non-active seasonal allergies and childhood asthma cleared for&#xD;
                  at least 3 years prior to screening.&#xD;
