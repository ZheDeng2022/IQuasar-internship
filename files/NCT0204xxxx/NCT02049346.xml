      * Background: Despite extensive use, to the best of our knowledge, no trial has&#xD;
      simultaneously compared the three currently used erythropoietin stimulating agents (ESAs) in&#xD;
      a prospective manner, in treatment of anemia of end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      * Patients and Methods: All haemodialysis patients in Qatar who were treated with short&#xD;
      acting Epoetin alfa or beta were screened. Eligible patients were randomized, either to&#xD;
      continue on the previous regimen of Epoetin, or to receive Darbepoetin alfa or continuous&#xD;
      erythropoietin receptor activator (C.E.R.A) for a total period of 40 weeks. All groups were&#xD;
      assessed at the end of the study for safety and efficacy parameters.&#xD;

      -  Objectives of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Primary Objective To evaluate efficacy of continuous erythropoietin receptor&#xD;
                activator (C.E.R.A.) and Darbepoetin Alfa, to maintain Hemoglobin level - within&#xD;
                the target recommended range - among ESRD patients, in direct comparison to&#xD;
                currently available ESA (Epoetin alfa and beta).&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Secondary Objective To compare the safety profile of the three groups (Epoetin,&#xD;
                Darbepoetin alpha, C.E.R.A.) by the prevalence of associated morbidity and&#xD;
                mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Study Subjects All haemodialysis patients of the main dialysis centers in Qatar&#xD;
                (Doha, Alkhour and Alwakra) were screened.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Study Design This is a prospective, randomized, comparative, open label study. The&#xD;
                study has passed through three phases; the first phase was screening period for 4&#xD;
                weeks, the 2nd phase was titration period for 12 weeks and the third phase was&#xD;
                evaluation period for 24 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
                All patients have entered a 4-week screening/baseline period during which they&#xD;
                continued to receive their previous Epoetin beta or alfa treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Eligible patients were then randomly assigned (1:1:1), either to continue on the&#xD;
                previous same dose and route of administration of Epoetin alpha or beta (Epoetin&#xD;
                group), or to receive Darbepoetin alfa (Aranesp ® Amgen) every week or 2weeks&#xD;
                (Darbepoetin group) or methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta (Mircera ® Roche&#xD;
                ,F. Hoffmann-La Roche, Basel, Switzerland) once monthly (C.E.R.A. group).&#xD;
&#xD;
                In the second group Subjects who were receiving Epoetin alpha/ beta two or three&#xD;
                times a week were switched to Darbepoetin alfa once a week, while those receiving&#xD;
                Epoetin alpha or beta once a week were switched to Darbepoetin alfa once every 2&#xD;
                weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Two hundred IU Epoetin: 1 mcg Darbepoetin alfa ratio was used to determine the&#xD;
                starting dose of Darbepoetin alfa. If a dose of Epoetin alpha or beta does not&#xD;
                equate exactly to a unit dose of Darbepoetin alfa at switching, then the nearest&#xD;
                available unit dose of Darbepoetin alfa was used.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Darbepoetin alfa doses were adjusted according to the approved prescribing&#xD;
                information, without additional restrictions.&#xD;
&#xD;
                In the third group Mircera® (F.Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd., Basel, Switzerland) is&#xD;
                provided as pre-filled syringes.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Intravenous monthly administration was carried out. The initial dose was 120 mcg,&#xD;
                200 mcg or 360 mcg, provided that patient had previously received a weekly dose of&#xD;
                Epoetin alpha/ beta of less than 8000 IU, between 8000 to16 000 IU or more&#xD;
                than16000IU respectively. Doses of C.E.R.A. were adjusted according to protocol and&#xD;
                not more than once monthly.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Doses of C.E.R.A. were decreased by 25% for Hb values &gt;12 and ≤13 g/dL and&#xD;
                increased by 25% for Hb &lt;11 and ≥10 g/dL. C.E.R.A. dose was increased by 50% for Hb&#xD;
                &lt;10 g/dL. Treatment was interrupted temporarily if Hb exceeds 13 g/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
                The doses for all patients were adjusted so that haemoglobin concentrations would&#xD;
                remain within a target range of 11-12 g/dL during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Iron supplementation was to be initiated or intensified according to centre&#xD;
                practice in cases of iron deficiency (serum ferritin &lt;100 μg/L, transferrin&#xD;
                saturation &lt;20%, or hypochromic red blood cells &gt;10%) and discontinued in patients&#xD;
                who had serum ferritin levels &gt;800 μg/L or transferring saturation &gt;50%.&#xD;
&#xD;
                The study was conducted in accordance with the revised Declaration of Helsinki, and&#xD;
                the study protocol was approved by our internal research committee. Written&#xD;
                informed consent was obtained from all studied patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Sample Size and Technique One hundred and ten patients were planned to be recruited&#xD;
                in each arm according to number of eligible subjects after screening period.&#xD;
                (Alpha= 0.05, B= 0.20 having 66% response rate by MIRCERA , 40.4% response rate by&#xD;
                darbepoetin alpha So by comparing the sample size happened to be 107 individual for&#xD;
                each group.[Statistical methods for rates and proportion by Joseph L. Fleiss (2nd.&#xD;
                1981, John Wiley &amp; Sons, NY), chapter 3].&#xD;
&#xD;
                The study has primarily evaluated the whole population of haemodialysis patients in&#xD;
                Qatar.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Laboratory assessment of the haemoglobin, haematocrit, white blood cell count,&#xD;
                platelet count was measured at weekly intervals. Aspartate amino transferase,&#xD;
                alanine aminotransferase, albumin, alkaline phosphatase, C- reactive protein,&#xD;
                potassium, phosphorus, serum ferritin, serum iron, serum transferrin, total&#xD;
                iron-binding capacity were measured at monthly intervals. Physical examinations&#xD;
                including chest, heart, abdomen examination and evaluation of the volume status&#xD;
                were performed at baseline, monthly and at the final visit. Fractional clearance of&#xD;
                urea (Kt/V) or urea reduction ratio was used to assess adequacy of haemodialysis at&#xD;
                baseline then monthly as unit protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Data were collected in data collection forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Data Management and Analysis plan Collected data was fed in excel sheet and then&#xD;
                converted to SPSS 14.0 statistical package for analysis. Descriptive statistics&#xD;
                were performed for all the continuous and categorical variables appropriately.&#xD;
                Parametric and non parametric statistical techniques were applied to see&#xD;
                significance difference between the groups. P value 0.05 (two tailed) or less was&#xD;
                considered as statistical significant level.&#xD;
