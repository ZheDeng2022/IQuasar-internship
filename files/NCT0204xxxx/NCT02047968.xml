      The objective of the study is to examine whether a combination of wake therapy, light therapy&#xD;
      and sleep time stabilization as a supplement to standard treatment can reduce depressive&#xD;
      symptoms in patients admitted at two psychiatric wards at Aarhus University Hospital,&#xD;
      Risskov. Seventy-four patients will be randomized either to this intervention or to a control&#xD;
      group receiving treatment as usual. Furthermore, it will be examined whether the duration of&#xD;
      admission can be reduced in the intervention group. Finally, the aim is to identify&#xD;
      predictors of good effect of the intervention.&#xD;

      Background: About 150,000 Danes will constantly have symptoms of depression, and 20% of those&#xD;
      are admitted to a psychiatric hospital at least once. When admitted, the patients are highly&#xD;
      tormented and many have suicide thoughts. The treatment of depression in a ward consists of&#xD;
      beginning or adjustment of antidepressive medication combined with for instance milieu&#xD;
      therapy, psychotherapy and exercise offers. Full effect of medical treatment is only reached&#xD;
      after 4-6 weeks, and no quicker effect is documented in the other treatment methods.&#xD;
      Therefore, methods are needed which quickly, effectively and without large side effects can&#xD;
      reduce the symptoms. Wake therapy is a treatment method which has appeared to stop or reduce&#xD;
      depressive symptoms within hours, and several studies have demonstrated that up to 66% of the&#xD;
      patients responded to wake therapy. The method consists in the patients staying awake for one&#xD;
      night and the following day, in all 36 hours, which is followed by one night of sleep. Light&#xD;
      therapy and stabilisation of circadian rhythm have been shown to maintain the effect of wake&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To examine the efficacy of using wake and light therapy as a supplement to&#xD;
      standard treatment of hospitalised patients with depression and to identify the&#xD;
      characteristics of patients who accept and respond well to the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The project is carried out as a randomised controlled study and will include 74&#xD;
      patients with bipolar or unipolar depression. The patients are randomised to standard&#xD;
      treatment or to the intervention, which besides standard treatment will consist of three&#xD;
      times wake therapy in one week and 30 minutes daily light treatment in the entire nine week&#xD;
      study period as well as ongoing guidance in good sleep hygiene. Raters for the Hamilton&#xD;
      rating will be blinded to the treatment assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome: Primary outcome criteria will be the response rate in week two. Response is defined&#xD;
      as a 50 % reduction or more compared to the baseline score in HAM-D 17. Secondary outcomes&#xD;
      will be the remission rate in week two, the length of admission and the percentage of&#xD;
      patients with response and remission in week nine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables and Assessment: Severity of depression will be assessed by using the&#xD;
      interview-based Hamilton Depression Rating scale, both the 17 item and the 6 item version.&#xD;
      For patient-reported outcome measures the Major Depression Inventory (MDI) and the World&#xD;
      Health Organisation (WHO)-5 wellbeing Index (WHO-5) will be used. Social and Occupational&#xD;
      Functional Assessment Scale (GAF) and Bech-Rafaelsen mania scala (MAS) will also be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis: Data will be analysed in SPSS and presented descriptively in the two Groups to&#xD;
      show whether the randomisation succeeded. A &quot;intention to treat&quot; analysis will be conducted,&#xD;
      and on the basis of a requisite analysis a t-test, Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test or chi2-test&#xD;
      will be used. The association between predictive factors and response to wake therapy will be&#xD;
      described with prevalence proportions, ratios and will be analysed with a chi2-test. The&#xD;
      level of statistical significance will be set at 5 %. The randomisation will be&#xD;
      computer-generated, and the patients will be randomly allocated to the intervention group or&#xD;
      the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: The literature shows response rates at 41% after two weeks in the intervention&#xD;
      group and 13 % in the control group. A power analysis based on these rates show that if α =&#xD;
      0,05 and β = 0,80, 37 patients should be included in each group, totally 74 patients.&#xD;
