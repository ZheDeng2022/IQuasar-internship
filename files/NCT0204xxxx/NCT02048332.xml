  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this research study, the investigators want to learn more about the use of donor-derived&#xD;
      viral specific T-cells (VSTs) to treat viral infections that occur after allogeneic stem cell&#xD;
      transplant. A viral specific T cell is a T lymphocyte (a type of white blood cell) that kills&#xD;
      cells that are infected (particularly with viruses). Allogeneic means the stem cells come&#xD;
      from another person. These VSTs are cells specially designed to fight the virus infections&#xD;
      that can happen after a bone marrow transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are asking people who have undergone or will undergo an allogeneic stem&#xD;
      cell transplant to enroll in this research study, because viral infections are a common&#xD;
      problem after allogeneic stem cell transplant and can cause significant complications&#xD;
      including death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stem cell transplant reduces a person's ability to fight infections. There is an increased&#xD;
      risk of getting new viral infections or reactivation of viral infections that the patient has&#xD;
      had in the past, such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), adenovirus (ADV),&#xD;
      BK virus (BKV), and JC virus. There are anti-viral medicines available to treat these&#xD;
      infections, though not all patients will respond to the standard treatments. Moreover,&#xD;
      treatment of viral infections is expensive and time consuming, with families often&#xD;
      administering prolonged treatments with intravenous anti-viral medications, or patients&#xD;
      requiring prolonged admissions to the hospital. The medicines can also have side effects like&#xD;
      damage to the kidneys or reduction in the blood counts, so in this study the investigators&#xD;
      are trying to find an easier way to treat these infections.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The stem cell matched donor will be asked to provide a blood donation for the VSTs&#xD;
      generation. In the laboratory, the investigators will treat this blood sample to select out&#xD;
      the cells that will help fight viruses. The cells will be grown with peptides (protein&#xD;
      fragments that represent parts of the virus that will encourage the donor immune cells to&#xD;
      grow). The cells will be grown in the laboratory so that there is a stock of virus fighting&#xD;
      cells for the patient to use in the future. The investigators will freeze the cells and store&#xD;
      them in a freezer in the laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient has signs of virus in their blood after the transplant, they will be given the&#xD;
      cells to help fight the infection. If there are signs that the cells are helping fight the&#xD;
      infection, more cells may be given. The patient may get the cells up to 5 times, with 21 days&#xD;
      between each treatment (this timeframe may be shortened to 14 days for patients with no&#xD;
      evidence of viral response). If the patient does not show signs of a virus, the cells will&#xD;
      stay in the freezer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following VST infusion, (s)he will be monitored with physical exams daily while inpatient and&#xD;
      weekly while outpatient as well as blood tests weekly until 30 days after the last infusion&#xD;
      of cells. The patient will have 3 teaspoons (15 mL) of blood drawn and urine collected before&#xD;
      each cell infusion and then once a week after each infusion for 4 weeks and then once a month&#xD;
      if possible for 1 year after the last infusion, all to monitor for the viral response.&#xD;
