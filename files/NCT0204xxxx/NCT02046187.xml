  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to see if reducing blood sugar and increasing ketones (a metabolic product&#xD;
      that comes from using fats for energy) can increase survival and enhance the the effects of&#xD;
      standard radiation and chemotherapy treatments used to treat glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).&#xD;
      These changes occur from use of a ketogenic diet. This research has 2 goals:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Show that patients can tolerate the diet and maintain low blood glucose and high blood&#xD;
           ketone levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Show if this diet enhances the effectiveness of standard treatment by prolonging&#xD;
           survival of patients with a GBM.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to offer this study to patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma&#xD;
      multiforme (GBM) that undergo gross total resection (GTR) or subtotal resection (STR) of&#xD;
      their tumor. Post-operatively, these patients and their families will be instructed in the&#xD;
      implementation of the Ketogenic Diet (KD) and it will be started as soon as possible&#xD;
      following surgery to achieve ketosis and reduction of blood sugar. Patients will receive&#xD;
      standard chemoradiotherapy with fractionated external beam radiation (60Gy) and concurrent&#xD;
      oral temozolomide chemotherapy followed by 12 adjuvant cycles of temozolomide chemotherapy on&#xD;
      a standard dose schedule. Outcome measures of the study group will be compared to historic&#xD;
      controls in the treatment arm from the European Organization for Research and Treatment of&#xD;
      Cancer (EORTC) temozolomide study published by Roger Stupp et al, New England Journal of&#xD;
      Medicine, March 10, 2005.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note: Gross Total Resection (GTR), Subtotal Resection (STR), temozolomide (Temodar), and&#xD;
      radiation therapy are routine care for GBM and are not an investigational component of this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study end-points:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary: Ketogenic diet (KD) tolerance and compliance in brain tumor patients. The diet will&#xD;
      be considered tolerable if the patient chooses to remain compliant. Compliance is monitored&#xD;
      by the dietician using self reporting of diet, blood glucose and blood ketone levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary: Overall survival, time to recurrence, health and therapy-related quality of life.&#xD;
      Overall survival and progression free survival will be measured and compared to the historic&#xD;
      controls who received chemoradiotherapy in standard dose scheduling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory correlate: Molecular/immunohistochemical analysis of tumors that do and do not&#xD;
      respond to a KD.&#xD;

    <description>Patients/families meet with the study dietician after surgery to discuss the ketogenic diet (KD), ask questions and plan clinic visits. Before radiation and chemotherapy begins, training takes place about the diet, meal planning and ketone/glucose monitoring. Ketosis will begin with the help of the dietitian one week before radiation begins. The patient will follow a classic 4/1 KD during chemo-radiation, followed by a modified Atkins diet during monthly chemotherapy. At the end of this period patients will follow a normal low carbohydrate diet similar to a Diabetic diet. The dietitian will follow the patient over the course of treatment. The patient will take and record ketone and glucose blood levels daily from start to end of treatment MRI scan, and meet with the dietitian weekly during radiation, at follow-up visits and on an as-needed basis.</description>
