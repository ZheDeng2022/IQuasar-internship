    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety (acute adverse effects associated with infusions, and inhibitor&#xD;
      development), pharmacokinetics (PK), and efficacy with respect to breakthrough bleeding and&#xD;
      control of hemorrhaging during prophylaxis of IB1001 in subjects with hemophilia B.&#xD;

      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to evaluate safety of IB1001 within the first 50 exposure days,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to determine IB1001 pharmacokinetics (PK), and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to assess efficacy of IB1001 prophylaxis with respect to breakthrough bleeding and with&#xD;
           respect to control of hemorrhaging in subjects with severe hemophilia B within the first&#xD;
           50 exposure days&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to evaluate long-term safety of IB1001; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to evaluate long term efficacy of IB1001.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to evaluate markers of thrombogenicity during the first 24 hours post-infusion&#xD;
           [thrombogenicity markers will include at a minimum D-dimer test; however should there be&#xD;
           a clinical reason (e.g., three consecutive elevations in D-dimer levels, a possible&#xD;
           clinical thrombogenic episode), sufficient samples will be collected to also evaluate&#xD;
           levels of fragment 1+2 (F1+2) and thrombin-antithrombin III complex (TAT)]&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to evaluate IB1001 immunogenicity response (development of inhibitory and non-inhibitory&#xD;
           factor IX binding antibodies and antibodies to host cell proteins)&#xD;

    <description>Prophylaxis (during Treatment and Continuation phases): 40 - 75 IU/kg twice weekly.&#xD;
The starting dose for prophylaxis may be based on previous recombinant factor IX product use. The recommended starting prophylaxis dose is 40 - 60 IU/kg twice weekly, however, the investigator may prescribe up to 75 IU/kg twice weekly at their discretion (after clinically assessing the subject) and discretion of the subject.&#xD;
The dose or the frequency of IB1001 prophylaxis may be adjusted at the discretion of the investigator.</description>
