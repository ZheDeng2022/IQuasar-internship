  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Liver resection is an operation to remove the diseased part of the liver. The liver is&#xD;
      supplied by two vessels, the hepatic artery and the portal vein supplying 25% and 75%&#xD;
      respectively of the total blood flow with 50% oxygen from each vessel. During liver resection&#xD;
      it is standard practice to clamp both vessels(Pringle's manoeuvre), so as to avoid bleeding.&#xD;
      Clamping both the vessels deprives the unaffected liver from nutrients required for survival.&#xD;
      Reinstating the blood supply causes further damage by pouring harmful substances into the&#xD;
      liver, which accumulate during the clamping. We hypothesize that not clamping the oxygen rich&#xD;
      hepatic artery will cause less damage to the liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our aim is to compare the Pringle manoeuvre with portal vein clamping, to identify if the&#xD;
      latter will result in less tissue injury and thereby fewer complications. Initially we aim to&#xD;
      conduct a pilot study. The main objective is to ensure that patients can be successfully&#xD;
      recruited and that data capture is complete. The secondary outcomes will be development of&#xD;
      infective complications by 30 days following surgery, bleeding and blood transfusion&#xD;
      requirements, heart/chest complications, recovery of liver functions, growth of remnant&#xD;
      liver, death within 30 days following surgery, length of high dependency unit/hospital stay&#xD;
      and quality of life at 3 months after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is published literature on the safety of this method and in the event of any&#xD;
      intraoperative problems, the procedure will be converted to the standard Pringle manoeuvre.&#xD;
      The Liver Unit at St James's University Hospital has four surgeons performing around 270&#xD;
      liver cancer resections per year, of which nearly 160 are for bowel cancer spread.&#xD;
      Considering the team's experience in research and liver surgery, we believe it is well placed&#xD;
      to conduct the trial in a safe and efficient manner.&#xD;
