  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory condition of unknown aetiology,&#xD;
      characterized by a diffuse confluent mucosal inflammation of the colon starting from the&#xD;
      rectum with a relapsing and remitting course. Conventional endoscopy was thought to be a&#xD;
      reliable parameter of disease activity, but microscopic inflammation can persist despite&#xD;
      normal mucosal findings. Histologically detectable inflammation is associated with a greater&#xD;
      risk of subsequent relapse. A flare in UC activity is difficult to predict, but a simple,&#xD;
      easily measured biological marker of relapse would be important in guiding the most&#xD;
      appropriate therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent technological advances in fiber optics, light sources, detectors, and molecular&#xD;
      biology have stimulated development of numerous optical methods that promise to significantly&#xD;
      improve our ability to evaluate human epithelium in vivo. These methods, collectively termed&#xD;
      &quot;optical biopsy,&quot; are nondestructive in situ assays of mucosal histopathology using light&#xD;
      that can provide instantaneous tissue assessment. Narrow band imaging (NBI) is a novel&#xD;
      technique that enhances the diagnostic capability of endoscopes in characterising tissues by&#xD;
      using filters in a redgreenblue (RGB) sequential illumination system. This results in&#xD;
      improved mucosal contrast and detail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      UC always involves the distal colon and activity is usually greatest in rectosigmoid area.&#xD;
      This makes evaluation of the rectum and sigmoid an attractive marker in patients with UC.&#xD;
      Unlike serum and faecal markers, endoscopic assessment of the mucosa is unlikely to be&#xD;
      affected by systemic disease and would be acceptable test for patients and physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to evaluate THE rectosigmoid mucosa in patients with UC by flexible endoscope using&#xD;
      both white light and NBI endoscopy. These patients will be followed by for one year or until&#xD;
      they relapse, whichever comes first. The aim of our study is to develop endoscopic biomarkers&#xD;
      to predict relapse in acute and quiescent UC.&#xD;
