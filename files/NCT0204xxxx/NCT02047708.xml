  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many patients with scleroderma have damage to their kidneys caused by the disease. There is&#xD;
      limited evidence for treatments to prevent this damage or stop it progressing. Blocking a&#xD;
      substance in the blood called endothelin has helped treat some aspects of scleroderma. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to see how effective a new endothelin blocker called Zibotentan is&#xD;
      in treating patients who have scleroderma and have gone on to develop reduced kidney function&#xD;
      as a complication. It will be given in addition to the accepted treatments used for&#xD;
      scleroderma. There will be three parts to this study each for a different group of patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ZEBRA 1 for patients with mild or moderate kidney disease caused by scleroderma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ZEBRA 2A for patients with a more severe, acute form of kidney disease caused by&#xD;
           scleroderma (scleroderma renal crisis) who do not require dialysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ZEBRA 2B for patients who have had scleroderma renal crisis and are on dialysis&#xD;

      This is a 3-part study (Zebra 1, 2A and 2B) that will explore safety and therapeutic&#xD;
      potential of Zibotentan in acute and chronic renal complications of Scleroderma. Trial&#xD;
      duration will be 52 weeks for Zebra 1 and 2A (1 or 2 weeks for ZEBRA 2B with 1 year follow up&#xD;
      data). Scleroderma (Systemic sclerosis) is a multisystem rheumatic disease that results in&#xD;
      vascular damage and fibrosis of target organs.This project will focus specifically on the&#xD;
      evaluation and treatment of renal disease in scleroderma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Renal involvement in Scleroderma occurs with a variety of different pathologiesÍ¾ hypertensive&#xD;
      scleroderma renal crisis (SRC) being the most dramatic manifestation but milder forms of&#xD;
      chronic renal disease are frequent and represent an important clinical feature.&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Previous use of an endothelin receptor antagonist within 3 months of the study start&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Significant abnormalities in liver function testing (ALT, ALP, Bilirubin) more than&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Patients with conditions which prevent compliance with the protocol or failure to&#xD;
             adhere to therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients with any other life threatening condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients with known hypersensitivity to Zibotentan or its excipients&#xD;
&#xD;
